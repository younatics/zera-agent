"By . James Rush . This is the heartbreaking moment a hippopotamus stood motionless and howled in grief after discovering the body of her dead baby before angrily defending the corpse from others. Wildlife photographer Neal Cooper captured the scene in Kasane, Botswana, as the mother stood helpless above the body of the young calf. Mr Cooper said he initially thought the hippo was stood above a large rock, but came to realise the grim reality as the animal's bawling roared around the park. Anguish: A hippopotamus stands motionless over the body of her dead calf and howls in grief . Heartbroken: The grief-stricken mother angrily defended the calf's body from other hippos after discovering it lying motionless on the floor . The mother's anguish soon turned to rage however as she was pictured warning off other animals by baring her teeth. Mr Cooper said: 'It was to be a trip not to be forgotten quickly. 'We spotted a hippopotamus standing motionless on the river bank with her head resting on something which looked like a rock and as we approached we spotted something lying on the ground in front of her. 'It turned out to be a very young dead hippo. I couldn't see any wounds on the side which was showing, so we pulled up the boat, kept a safe distance and watched as another very large hippo approached from the water. 'The mother hippo was showing all possible signs of aggression towards the intruder by spraying her faeces, showing her teeth and saliva dripping from her mouth. 'The other hippo, although a very large individual, dared not exit the river and face the mother so stayed in the water and eventually moved a safer distance away. Grief: Wildlife photographer Neal Cooper captured the scene in Kasane, Botswana, as the mother stood helpless above the body of the young calf . Angry: Mr Cooper said the mother was continuing to display aggressive behaviour towards the other hippos the following day and charged towards an individual before two other hippos attacked her . 'It really was quite a distressing sight to see unfold in-front of you.' Hippos are regarded as among the most lethal animals in Africa and mothers are well-known for being highly territorial when looking after their young. Mr Cooper said: 'We believe the youngster was either killed when it got in the way of a fight between adults or maybe even by a male hippo who killed the youngster to rule out future competition. 'We stayed with the grieving and obviously distressed mother as long as we could before we had to be out of the park and we left her standing over her dead calf. 'The next morning we decided to go back to the area to see if the carcass had attracted any predators during the night, but when we arrived we saw two other hippos standing over the body. Dangerous: Hippos are regarded as among the most lethal animals in Africa and mothers are well-known for being highly territorial when looking after their young . Aggression: Mr Cooper said the mother was chased around by the other hippos 'until she found a spot in deeper water and it eventually calmed down' 'A very large female was mouthing the carcass and when it was turned over we could see a bite mark on the side of the baby with the entrails showing. 'The mother emerged from the reeds from across the water and immediately lifted her head and stared at the intruders. 'The two hippos had by now entered the water and moved towards the rest of the pod while the mother had also entered the water and took up position a short distance away from the grouped animals. 'She was still displaying aggressive behaviour towards the other hippos when she charged towards an individual before two other hippos attacked her from behind. 'They chased her around until she found a spot in deeper water and it eventually calmed down but the whole thing was absolutely incredible to see.'","Photographer Neal Cooper captured scene on camera in Kasane, Botswana .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . The oldest runner in this year’s London Marathon has vowed to carry on competing for another two years until his 16 year-old grandson can take over from him. Paul Freedman, 89, only started running when he was 61 but now has 170 marathons under his belt. This Sunday will be the 22nd time he has taken part in the London race. One year he ran just 12 months after a massive heart attack. At the age of 89, Paul Freedman is the oldest competitor at this year's London Marathon . Mr Freedman has raised more than £100,000 for charity through his racing and was awarded a MBE in 2008 . Mr Freedman has run more than 170 marathon and this year will be his 22nd time running the London event . Mr Freedman, a retired retail buyer, has raised over £100,000 for charity over the years and was awarded the MBE in 2008 for his efforts. His grandson Samuel Freedman, 16, has begged him to keep doing marathons until he turns 18 and is old enough to take over from him in the London event. Samuel hopes his grandad will remain fit enough for them to run together in the 2016 marathon before he takes the family baton. Mr Freedman, from Hornchurch, Essex, said: 'I took up running when I was 61 because I had been stuck in a desk job but I had always been an active person. 'It’s the crowd that pushes you round the marathon course and I crack jokes as I’m going round to keep people’s spirits up. 'Samuel has said: ""Please granddad, wait until I’m 18"", but I’m not sure how well I’ll hold up to be honest. Mr Freedman has a whole room in his house dedicated to the medals and memorabilia of his running . Mr Freedman took up running at the age of 61 and has vowed to carry on for at least two more years . 'I’m a lot more unfit than I was but I’m still determined. My breathing isn’t as good as it used to be and my mouth gets dry. 'But I still exercise each week and I’m determined to finish in under eight hours this year so I can get another medal. 'Two years is a long time away but I’m going to do all I can to make sure I get to run in a marathon with my grandson.' Student Samuel said: 'I said to him I wanted to do just one with him. I think he’ll be well enough to do it because he walks a lot. 'He said I’ll be much fitter than him but obviously for the first one I’ll walk alongside him and I can just take in the atmosphere. 'And then I’ll be able to spur him on. I’m very proud of him. No one has a granddad like mine.' Mr Freedman was inspired to start fundraising for the St Francis Hospice, Essex, after his wife Reene died of lung cancer in 2007. He has dedicated an entire room in his home to all the medals and memorabilia from the races he has entered. Mr Freedman, a dad-of-one, added: 'I had a heart attack in 2003 and was in hospital for three weeks. I wasn’t allowed to run the 2004 marathon after that which I wasn’t happy about. 'The doctors told my son I would need a pacemaker but because I was so fit I didn’t need one. 'I still go to the hospice where they cared for my wife Reene every Christmas and I put on shows for them to fundraise too. 'I will be wearing orange for the hospice and my bib will have ‘officially the oldest runner’ on it. 'When I won the MBE I told the Queen I ran the marathon every year and she said: ""You run right past my house"". I wanted to say ""Yes, but you never wave at me.”' Paul is hoping to raise £6,000 this year. The oldest ever London Marathon runner was Fauja Singh, from Essex, who completed the race in 6 hours, 7 minutes at the age of 93 in 2004.","Paul Freedman 89, has run 170 marathons since taking up running aged 61 .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . When most people think of Jesus, they don't typically think of grown men beating each other to a pulp. But for a collection of small Christian churches, mixed martial arts submission moves like the arm bar and the triangle choke hold are as integral a part of worshiping Christ as communion wine and Bible verses. A new documentary goes inside some of these churches and examines the relationship between MMA and Christianity by following a group of cage-fighting pastors who preach that a punch in the jaw is better than turning the other cheek. 'Weâ€™ll just be a couple of God-fearing men punching each other in the . face,' one of the pastors explains in a trailer for the documentary, titled Fight . Church. Pastor/Cage fighter: Pastor Paul Burress says he and his parishioners  don't fight 'out of meanness' Worship/workout: Many of the fighters train in the same building where they attend worship services . The film's website describes the congregations of these so-called 'Fight Club' churches as being 'made up of passionate, . genuine people from all walks of the Christian faith who are trained and . prepared to provide practical and spiritual care to fighters, coaches . other members of the MMA community and their families.' The film also features former UFC lightweight champion Benson . Henderson and current UFC light heavyweight champion Jon Jones, who each . discuss how their faith plays a role in their fighting. MMA pastor Paul Burress - of Victory Church in Rochester, New York - is featured in the film and defends the taboo practices of his church. Love thy neighbor: The film poses the question of 'Can you love your neighbor as yourself and at the same time knee him in the face as hard as you can?' Controversy: The documentary features children fighting other children, which has angered traditional Christians . 'We . donâ€™t fight out of meanness,' Burress told ABC News. 'We have no hate or bitterness in our heart.' The documentary, directed by Oscar-winner Daniel Junge, raises a simple question: 'Can you love your neighbor as yourself and at the same time knee him in the face as hard as you can?' Other pastors featured in the documentary defend the violence - which includes a young child pounding on another - as a part of Christianity. 'Jesus never tapped out,' says one of the pastors. 'He came to finish what he needed to do.' 'Love': A Catholic priest criticizes 'fight churches' saying there is 'no love' in violence - especially when children are involved, like the two pictured here . 'Fight churches' have received mixed reviews from Christians. However, a more traditional priest interviewed for the documentary does not agree with the claims of 'Fight Church' pastors that violence is just an expression of love. 'John says love one another,' the priest says. 'This is not love.'","The taboo take on Christianity is featured in a new documentary about 'fight churches'

"By . Sophie Jane Evans . Another life sentence: Nicky Suddons, 26, has been given a second life sentence after carrying out a savage sex attack while on day release from prison . A notorious rapist who carried out a savage sex attack at knifepoint after being let out of prison for a day on 'work experience' has been given a second life sentence. Nicky Suddons, 26, was jailed for life aged 17 for a rape and six other serious assaults on women and a girl aged 13 in Manchester in 2004. But after being deemed safe to work in the community, he assembled a ‘rape kit’ containing a knife, balaclava and rubber gloves. Left unsupervised during his lunch . break, he then tried to rape a woman in her 50s as she walked her Labrador in a park near Grantham, Lincolnshire. The victim was only saved because the dog turned on the former lifeguard. Now, Suddons has been handed a second life sentence with a minimum jail term of six years - but has been warned he may never be deemed safe to be released into the community. Sentencing him at Lincoln Crown Court, Judge Sean Morris said: 'I stress that is the minimum term you will serve. 'I . strongly suspect that the lesson in your case has been learned, and it . will be many years, if not decades - and it may be never - when it comes to . considering your release. 'You . are an extremely dangerous human being. I am convinced you will . sexually assault and rape women in the future if you are released. 'In . this case your victim has been severely traumatised. She has not been . able to return to work. She has been diagnosed with post traumatic . stress disorder. Crime scene: After being deemed safe to work in the community, he assembled a 'rape kit' containing a knife, balaclava and rubber gloves. He then tried to rape a woman in Queen Elizabeth Park (pictured) near Grantham . 'She cannot now go out of her house without the dog and . without a rape alarm. That is severe psychological harm.' After his initial crime spree in 2004, Suddons became known as the ‘Yellow Brick Road’ rapist based on the area of Manchester where he carried out the attacks. He later boasted about his crimes on social media sites, saying he carried out the knifepoint assaults for kicks and regarded himself as 'untouchable'. He was handed a life sentence in September 2005 - with the judge warning he had ‘an extremely high risk of reoffending’ and . was a ‘highly dangerous young man’. Case: Now, Suddons has been handed a second life sentence with a minimum jail term of six years at Lincoln Crown Court (pictured). He has been warned he may never be deemed safe to be released into the community . But in Spring last year, Suddons was deemed safe to . be let out of North Sea Camp open prison near Boston, Lincolnshire, to carry . out painting and decorating work in Grantham. By that time, he has completed a sex offender treatment programme designed to deter him from committing further sex attacks. Under the day release arrangement, . Suddons slept at the prison every night, but was allowed out during the . day to carry out his work placement. While out of prison, he collected together the 'rape kit' - including condoms to stop police tracing him through DNA - before attempting to rape the middle-aged woman during his lunch hour. Warning. Sentencing Suddons, Judge Sean Morris (right) branded him 'an extremely dangerous human being'. Left, the criminal is pictured in 2005 after being imprisoned for carrying out seven sex assaults in Manchester . David Outterside, prosecuting, said Suddons had left his work renovating an old property for a church, before making his way to Queen Elizabeth Park where he lay in wait for a victim. After changing his clothes, he then confronted the woman as she walked her pet Labrador through a wooded area. The woman told the jury how she turned round to find herself face to face with a masked man brandishing a knife. She said she fell to the ground and screamed while her dog started barking. Suddons stood over her and warned 'Don’t scream', the court heard. Initial case: Suddons received his first life sentence at Manchester Crown Court (pictured) in September 2005 . The woman told the jury: 'My eyes were . fixed on the knife and the mask. His thumb was on the Stanley knife as . if the blade was ready to be flicked.' Suddons backed off as the dog lunged at him and then fled, but was caught and later arrested after a cyclist stopped him from leaving the park. Mr Outterside said that Suddons had carefully planned the attack and had hoped his rape kit would help him avoid the mistakes he had made leading to his arrest in 2004. 'What was on his mind was rape,' he said. 'This time he was prepared and was absolutely determined not to be caught. He thought he could get clean away with it but he was caught red-handed.' Concern: Suddons's conviction in December sparked a review of the prisoner day release scheme by Justice Secretary Chris Grayling . Suddons, originally from Abbey Hey, Manchester, received his first life . sentence at Manchester Crown Court in September 2005 after admitting a . rape and six sexual assaults on victims aged between 13 and 28. Several of the attacks were at knife point taking place in a local park and in an area close to a canal. He . was ordered to serve a minimum of just four years because he was a . juvenile aged 17 when he committed the offences. In his latest case, he denied attempting to rape the middle-aged woman on 28 June 2013, but the jury took less than an hour to convict him. In evidence, he claimed the last time he had had sex was when he raped a 28-year-old woman in East Manchester ten years ago. He told the jury: 'That was the last time I had sex. I think about sex the same as every bloke. I don’t think about it all the time. Not daily.' Suddons's conviction in December sparked a review of the prisoner day release scheme by Justice . Secretary Chris Grayling, who described the case as 'horrifying'. 'This is a truly horrifying case and one that needs to be investigated thoroughly,' he said. ‘I’m . determined to get to the bottom of what went wrong and to take forward . any lessons learnt from the reviews I have commissioned. ‘In . future when people are released on temporary licence I want to see them . tagged so we can better monitor where they are and where they have . been.’ Last month, it was announced that day release from prison is to be scaled back following a series of serious crimes committed by offenders temporarily out of jail. Tighter rules about who is eligible for the scheme are to be introduced, while prisoners will only be allowed out for a specific purpose, such as gaining work experience, the Ministry of Justice said. Day-release prisoners will also have to wear electronic tags, once technology is made available, the department added. For prisoners with a history of serious crimes, there will be a new 'restricted' level where they will undergo stringent risk assessments by probation officers and other professionals. Suddons's case was the second high profile case involving an life sentence inmate from North Sea Camp on work placement. In October 2012, Lee Cyrus went on the run after being let out on day release for work. He was only arrested after going on a crime spree and was subsequently convicted following a jury trial of five counts of exposure, wounding with intent, unlawful wounding, affray, aggravated burglary, robbery and burglary. He was jailed at Southwark Crown Court in December when he received a new life sentence and was ordered to serve a minimum of 11 years.","Nicky Suddons, 26, was originally jailed in 2004 for seven sex assaults .

"By . Steve Doughty, Social Affairs Correspondent . Children are doing so little activity that their lives may be shorter as a result, a parliamentary report found yesterday. Children are doing so little physical activity that their lives may be shorter as a result, a parliamentary report found yesterday . Half of seven-year-olds do not do any exercise on a regular basis, the report said. It warned that lack of physical activity is a habit laid down in childhood – and is responsible for one in five premature deaths. The report called for a Government-backed programme to encourage children into sport, outdoor play and walking or cycling, with the aim of encouraging them to carry on with physical activities throughout their lives. According to the findings, only half of seven-year-olds engage in regular physical activity. Over the past 50 years, the report said, the level of activity taken by Britons dropped by 20 per cent. The report follows a series of evidence sessions conducted by the parliamentarians, led by former Paralympic racer Baroness Grey-Thompson. It said inactivity is likely to increase and demanded publicly-funded campaigns to encourage exercise. One of the group’s supporters, 2012 Olympic organiser Lord Coe, said: ‘Not many people are aware that physical inactivity currently accounts for nearly one-fifth of premature deaths in the UK. 'With projections showing that inactivity levels are due to increase by a further 15 per cent by 2030 there is no doubt that the issue requires immediate national attention and urgent action. ‘The report from the All-Party Commission on Physical Activity represents a true shift in how governments, NGBs, corporations, and the civil sector can work together in shaping the world’s perception of sport and physical activity.’ The report was led by paralympian Baroness Tani Grey-Thompson (left). Lord Coe (right) is a supporter of the research. He said: 'Not many people are aware that physical inactivity currently accounts for nearly one-fifth of premature deaths in the UK' A public health campaign should concentrate of persuading people of the benefits of getting out of their chairs and taking some form of exercise, the report said. It called for the production of a set of measure by which people can tell if they are getting enough exercise. The report said people should be encouraged into physical activity both at work and in their spare time and that there should be efforts to press more people into walking and cycling to work. It said that promoting physical education, sport and outdoor play among children could help make physical activity a lifelong habit. The report suggested that illness caused by lack of exercise costs the economy £20billion a year. A public health campaign should concentrate of persuading people of the benefits of getting out of their chairs and taking some form of exercise, the report said.","Lack of physical activity habit formed in childhood, report warns .

"By . Sam Webb . and Mark Duell . A stag weekend reveller suffered serious burns in a seafront nightclub after being doused in Brut aftershave and set ablaze in a prank, it was claimed today. The 34-year-old victim was drinking with friends when they started throwing the aftershave over each other as a joke at Long John’s Showbar on Britannia Pier in Great Yarmouth, Norfolk.

"By . Amanda Williams . A farmer accused of the manslaughter of a rambler who was gored to death by one of his bulls had admitted it ‘kept walkers on their toes’, a court heard. Paul Waterfall, 39, denies manslaughter by gross negligence after Roger Freeman died on a public path on Underhill Farm in Stanford-on-Soar in November 2010. The 63-year-old died after he was allegedly attacked by the bull while walking with his wife Glenis, 70. Paul Waterfall, who is charged with manslaughter by gross negligence after rambler Roger Freeman  was allegedly killed by one of his bulls in a field in Stanford on Soar, Nottinghamshire, in November 2010 . Waterfall is accused of breaching his duty of care to the public by failing to ensure the bull was safely confined on his land on the Nottinghamshire/Leicestershire border. Opening his case at Nottingham Crown Court today, prosecutor Andrew McGee told the jury Waterfall was aware of the ‘deadly risk’ posed by the bull, who was named Moonriver Zac Pi, and of the public footpath that ran across his land. The trial, being held at Nottingham Crown Court, is expected to last five weeks . The court heard that the bull, known as Zac, the 19-month-old Brown Swiss bull had been involved in two previous incidents just weeks before the fatal attack on Mr Freeman. Mr McGee said: ‘As a farmer Paul Waterfall had a duty of care to those who used the public footpath. Paul Waterfall had that duty of care and knew his bull posed a real risk of death to people using that path’ The prosecutor added that Waterfall had been ‘grossly neglectful’ in failing to take any steps to prevent that risk. ‘The death was made all the more tragic because it was completely avoidable’, he added. The jury of four women and eight men heard Mr Freeman, from Glen Parva, Leicestershire, was walking with his wife along the public footpath through a field off Leake Lane in Stanford on Soar at around 4.30pm on Friday November 12 2010 when the bull struck. The couple were experienced walkers who had been on a walking holiday. Dressed in walking clothes and boots, the couple had walked for about 12 miles when they reached the public footpath near Mr Waterfall’s farm, Mr McGee told the jury. Mrs Freeman told police after the attack that the couple had seen cows and a bull in the field when they had got on to the path, Mr McGee told the court. She was walking ahead when she heard an ‘oof’ from her husband and turned around, the prosecutor told the court. ‘Glenis saw Roger on the ground with the bull there,’ Mr McGee said. ‘She tried to distract the bull but it attacked her and continued to attack Roger. ‘Roger told her to go and get help. He told her “I’m sorry my baby I can’t get us out of this.”’ Mrs Freeman told officers the animal had 12-inch horns which were long and curved and described it as ‘brown and slobbering’. She told them the animal had “looked excited and had started pawing at the ground” before attacking her husband, Mr McGee told the jury. It then pawed at the ground and ran at her, he said. She told police it was like ‘a bull charging in a bull fight’. Mrs Freeman ran from the field and flagged down a motorist who called for an ambulance. She was taken to Queens Medical Centre in Nottingham where she had surgery for chest and abdominal injuries. Police and paramedics found Mr Freeman, a father-of-two, face down with only his underpants and boots on. His clothes had been stripped from him and were scattered at the scene, Mr McGee told the court. Mr Waterfall, 39, denies manslaughter by gross negligence after Roger Freeman (pictured with his wife) died on a public path on Underhill Farm in Stanford-on-Soar in November 2010 . The jury of four women and eight men heard Mr Freeman, from Glen Parva, Leicestershire, was walking with his wife along the public footpath through a field off Leake Lane in Stanford on Soar at around 4.30pm on Friday November 12 2010 when the bull struck . He was declared dead at the scene and taken to hospital where tests confirmed he had died from multiple injuries including fractures to his ribs and shoulders. The court heard the bull had allegedly been involved in two previous incidents with humans in the weeks leading up to the attack. On October 1, two Central Networks engineers had attempted to carry out emergency electrical repairs on the farmland but were chased off by the bull when it charged at them, Mr McGee told the jury. But the workers managed to fend of the animal with metal rods, and were rescued by Mr Waterfall, who picked them up on his truck. He told the workers that Zac was ‘a nasty, aggressive bull’ that he himself was wary of but that ‘he did keep walkers on their toes’, Mr McGee said. A second incident just two weeks before Mr Freeman was attacked involved another Central Networks engineer who had been carrying out work on the farmland. The prosecutor told the jury: ‘These comments are obviously significant in that they reveal as of October 1 - six weeks before the fatal incident - Paul Waterfall was well aware that Zac was aggresive and presented a risk to walkers in the field.’ A second incident just two weeks before Mr Freeman was attacked involved another Central Networks engineer who had been carrying out work on the farmland . Opening his case at Nottingham Crown Court today, prosecutor Andrew McGee told the jury Waterfall was aware of the 'deadly risk' posed by the bull, who was named Moonriver Zac Pi, and of the public footpath that ran across his land . The court heard Mr Waterfall had farmed at Underhill Farm for ten years and kept around 500 cattle of various breeds on the 300 acres. He bought Zac in 2009 to breed with his heffers. Mr McGee told the court that one previous owner had described Zac as 'a cocky bull' but none had reported any aggresive behaviour. However the prosecutor said dairy breeds were recognised as being ‘potentially more aggresive and dangerous’. Zac was put down immediately after the attack on Mr Freeman however Mr McGee claimed experts said the bull should have been culled following two previous incidents in the weeks before the fatal incident. Mr Waterfall was charged last year following an investigation by the Health and Safety Executive. The trial is expected to last up to five weeks.

"By . Ian Drury . IN CAMP BASTION, AFGHANISTAN . Toiling to defuse deadly improvised explosive devices on the Afghan frontline, siblings Kim and Lee Hughes really are brothers in arms. Kim, 34, is Britain’s bravest bomb hunter. The warrant officer was awarded the George Cross - the highest accolade for gallantry not in the face of the enemy - for heroism on the battlefield in 2009. He has returned to the warzone to oversee the Army units clearing the homemade bombs strewn across Helmand. Brothers in arms: Staff Sergeant Lee Hughes, left, and his younger brother, Warrant Officer Kim Hughes, serve together with 11 Explosive Ordnance Disposal Regiment, defusing improvised bombs in Afghanistan . No sibling rivalry: But Kim Hughes, who won the George Cross, admitted: 'I loved bossing him around' It is a family affair because the team which thwarts the Taliban’s terror tactics includes his big brother Lee, 35, a staff sergeant. Both soldiers insist there is no sibling rivalry – even though Kim, a married father-of-one, is the commander. Warrant Officer Class One Hughes said: ‘It’s sound that we’re able to be out here together. We have a good time. Family affair: The men's step-brother Matthew Heppenstall, 27, is about to join the regiment too . 'Lee is my brother, but he’s also a mega operator. I’ve got no issues whatsoever with his capability. ‘The professional answer is every one of my solders is exactly the same and they are treated exactly the same. My answer is he’s my big brother, and I love bossing him around.’ S/Sgt Hughes, a married father-of-three, said: ‘I’m the less brave big brother. You look round the dinner table – there’s only one with a George Cross. ‘But it’s not too bad working for him. There is a mutual understanding but there’s still the rank structure.’ Both men serve with 11 Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) Regiment, part of the Royal Logistics Corps, but on this tour of duty they are attached to the Royal Engineers. WO1 Hughes won his George Cross for what was hailed by top brass as ‘the single most outstanding act of explosive ordnance disposal ever recorded in Afghanistan’. On the morning of August 16 2009, British troops were taking part in a mission to reclaim a chunk of Sangin, a Taliban stronghold in Helmand. Disaster struck when Lance Corporal James Fullarton, 24, triggered a bomb. As he was evacuated on a stretcher by Fusilier Simon Annis, 22, and Fusilier Lewis Carter, 18, they tripped a second blast - killing them both and wounding three more. WO1 Hughes was called on to rescue the four maimed soldiers who were stranded in the middle of a minefield. Without a thought for his own safety, the bomb disposal expert cleared a path across the dusty open ground so the wounded could be evacuated and the dead men retrieved. Shunning protective clothing to save time, he picked his way across the field dotted with more of the booby-trap bombs. Keeping his cool beneath the Afghan sun and with the sound of bullets ringing in his ears, WO1 Hughes managed to dismantle seven IEDs - three by simply using his hands. Lee Hughes, left, admitted it was nerve-wracking to be in a room where only one man had a George Cross . Honour: Kim Hughes, now a Warrant Officer Class One, was awarded the George Cross at Buckingham Palace for a mission in which he disarmed seven improvised bombs to save colleagues without safety clothes . His 'utterly selfless action' allowed the casualties to be recovered. Tragically, L/Cpl Fullarton later died from his injuries. In total, WO1 Hughes cleared more than 80 buried bombs on that tour of duty. Five years later, he is in the operations room co-ordinating missions while his brother goes out on the ground. They have trained the Afghan National Security Forces to disarm IEDs. WO1 Hughes said: ‘It’s different because I’m not out on the ground and Lee is one of the operators – he’s doing the job when I was back out here. ‘It’s a lot quieter now. Because of the amount of training we have given the Afghan forces they run their own EOD teams now. ‘They have taken the majority of the work but we still provide capability when it’s requested and needed. ‘It does give you a sense of satisfaction to know we are leaving this country absolutely prepared to deal with the task in front of them.' Star soldier: Kim Hughes in 2009, before he received his George Cross, speaking to the then Defence Secretary Bob Ainsworth and Home Secretary Alan Johnson (centre) in Camp Bastion. Right, part of the men's uniform . Mum's the word: The men admitted their mother Francis, 54, has had a 'few years' of worrying about them . S/Sgt Hughes, who is on his third deployment to Afghanistan, has seen action during his stint in the warzone. On one occasion, he was 1ft from a booby-trap bomb which was protecting an insurgent ammunition dump. He was inspired to become a bomb disposal expert after his brother signed up. He said: ‘I spent eight years in the artillery and knew nothing about the job until Kim joined the Army and showed an interest in it.’ Both men admit their trade worries their mother Francis, 54. And their step-brother Matthew Heppenstall, 27, is about to join 11 EOD Regiment too. S/Sgt Hughes said: ‘When Kim was in Afghanistan and I was in Iraq she was worried and then I came back and I went to Afghanistan and came back and now we’re both here. 'She’s had a few years of it.’","Kim Hughes, 34, awarded George Cross for heroism by the Queen in 2009 .

"By . Damien Gayle . Hundreds of pictures of the South Korean president's compound have been found on a rudimentary drone apparently operated by the North Korean military, officials claim. Security has been stepped up at the Blue House in Seoul, the official residence of current President Park Guen-hye and location of a 1968 assassination attempt by Pyongyang against the then South Korean leader, since the discovery. The unmanned aerial vehicle was one of two which crashed on South Korean soil in the past fortnight, sparking fears that the Kim dictatorship could adapt the technology for terror attacks. Spying: This undated handout picture provided by the South Korean Defence Ministry shows an aerial image of Eunpyung New Town, Seoul, from a camera on the unmanned North Korean drone which crashed in Paju . One crashed in Paju, a city near the border with North Korea, on March 24. The other crashed Monday on the island of Baengnyeong. Looking more like hobbyists' remote controlled aeroplanes and equipped with cameras available on the Internet for just a few hundred pounds, the captured drones were basic, at best, South Korean experts said. But their discovery has prompted fears that South Korea's air defences are not up to the job of securing the country's airspace in the new era of drone warfare. 'Our government and military were not aware of the flight of the drone even when it was on a potentially dangerous mission,' the mass-circulation JoongAng Ilbo newspaper bellowed in an editorial. 'The drones' technology is not so impressive, but it could be used for terror if improved - either for a kamikaze attack or an attack with biological or chemical weapons.' This reconnaissance picture shows an aerial view of Seoul's Jichuk Station: The discovery has prompted fears that South Korea's air defences are not up to the job of in the new era of drone warfare . An aerial image of Samsung area of Goyang: South Korean defense officials say the drones are rudimentary, equipped with Japanese-made cameras capable of taking only still photos that cannot be transmitted . Defence officials revealed that the Paju drone had taken 193 photos of South Korea's presidential compound and other areas in Seoul and Paju, but they refused to disclose which other specific sites. The drone discovered Monday had taken photos of two front-line islands - Socheong and Daecheong - near the disputed western sea boundary with North Korea. South Korean defense officials say they are rudimentary, equipped with Japanese-made cameras capable of taking only still photos that cannot be transmitted in real time but must instead be retrieved. The Paju drone was equipped with a Canon camera and the other one carried a Nikon camera. Defense Ministry spokesman Kim Min-seok said the Canon camera can be bought for about 1million won, or about £570, on the Internet. Both were painted sky blue, probably cost only a few thousand dollars to build and were 55in wide by 71in long - giving them the appearance of the large model planes associated more with hobbyists than militaries. Lettering on the battery of the drone found at Paju and other forensic evidence suggest it was of North Korean origin, Mr Kim said yesterday. He said it had enough fuel to return to North Korea. The first drone probably crashed due to an engine problem and the second ran out of fuel, he said, adding that they evaded detection because they are so small and made of polycarbonate. Daechung Island: The drone discovered Monday had taken photos of two front-line islands - Socheong and Daecheong - near the disputed western sea boundary with North Korea . Sochung Island: Tthe captured drones are a far cry from the U.S.-made Global Hawk unmanned aerial vehicle, which South Korea plans to introduce to its military in the near future, at about $208million a pop . North Korea has recently been boasting of its drone program, a relatively new addition to its arsenal. It has prominently displayed large drone-like aircraft in military parades. If the South Korean claims that the North flew the drones on military surveillance missions are true, they would be the first solid, public evidence that it is trying to infiltrate South Korean airspace. While the capture of the two surveillance drones appears to offer a rare glimpse into the North's technology, analysts stress they do not necessarily represent the best unmanned aerial vehicles the North can field. They also note the captured drones are a far cry from the U.S.-made Global Hawk unmanned aerial vehicle, which South Korea plans to introduce to its military in the near future, at about $208million a pop. Rudimentary: Looking more like hobbyists' remote controlled aeroplanes and equipped with cameras available on the Internet for just a few hundred pounds, the captured drones were basic, at best . Defense Minister Kim Kwan-jin told South Korea's parliament today that North Korea has been developing unmanned drones since the Nineties. He said ministry officials are urgently working out measures to cope with drone threats as it's possible for the North to acquire a technology to develop small unmanned aircraft with self-destructive capabilities in the future. But some experts say that fears of kamikaze drone strikes from the North are an overreaction - at least for the time being. 'They can carry at most a hand grenade,' said Lee Hee Woo, a retired air force general who heads the Integrated Logistic Support Research Center at Chungnam National University in South Korea. 'A small aircraft won't be easily detected by radar, but they can't carry much so they can only be used for surveillance purposes. A bigger size of aircraft is needed to carry weapons, but that would be detected by radar.'","Two rudimentary drones have crashed in South Korean in the past fortnight .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A firefighter says a cigarette tossed onto mulch may have caused a destructive fire at a popular wedding venue in Massachusetts. Deputy Fire Chief Steven Bagley said that the fire started at the Lakeview Pavilion in Foxborough on Saturday night then spread to the main building. Bagley says the building did not have sprinklers and firefighters took water from a nearby pond to try and extinguish the blaze. The remainder of the building is now being demolished. Justice of the Peace Jerry Cibley says the fire began at the end of a wedding as the couple, their groomsmen and bridesmaids walked down the aisle. Between 140 and 150 people attended the wedding. Big day ruined by fire: Flames broke out in a Foxborough wedding facility just after a ceremony had been completed just after 7 pm Saturday. All wedding guests were evacuated from the Lakeview Pavilion before firefighters arrived on scene . A firefighter works on the scene of a multiple alarm fire at the popular Lakeview Pavilion in Foxborough, Mass. According to guests at the venue, the fire is believed to have started in a pile of newly-applied mulch . The fire department said the wind off the water was a major factor; the fire started in the rear of the building on the outside, and quickly spread. 'We did bring it down to ground level, which leads us to believe cigarette smoking, careless disposal in that area, led to this disastrous event,' said Capt. Edward Noonan of the Foxborough Fire Department. The building, more than 100 years old, did not have a sprinkler system because it was grandfathered in. 'It was determined that the fire was an accident due to careless disposal of fire materials,' Noonan said. 'We don’t know who the smoker is at this time.' All that remains: Firefighters save the sign from the venue in the hope that it may be reused in the future. Lakeview Pavilion burned to the ground after a fire was started from a cigarette thrown onto dry mulch . Gone in an instant: Foxborough fire officials said careless disposal of smoking material sparked the three-alarm fire that destroyed the 108-year-old venue, now reduced to charred rubble . Noonan said because the incident was an accident, the person who discarded the cigarette into the mulch will most likely not be charged with a crime, 'but they should have practiced common sense'. Several onlookers said it appeared the fire started in some newly-applied mulch outside the building, which is surrounded by a lake and woods, but it quickly spread to the building itself. 'The bride and groom are devastated — this was their big day,' Cibley said. 'I’m thankful everybody got out safely. It went up so quickly and could have been a lot worse with 140 to 150 people in there.' The couple have not been named and wish to stay anonymous. Reports that surfaced on Twitter said the Renaissance Hotel in Foxborough quickly organized a makeshift reception. Scores of onlookers arrived at the scene to lament the loss of the 108-year-old landmark. 'Thank goodness the lake is there,' said Paul Hubrich, who lives down the road. 'It’s incredibly sad — thank goodness everyone got out okay.' Landmark: The Lakeview Pavilion in Foxborough is 108-years-old and a celebrated venue in the area, accommodating countless weddings and proms . 'They tried so hard to save this building, but it was just fully engulfed,' Cibley explained. Firefighters did save . the carved wooden sign that hung over the entrance to the building . before the demolition process was to begin. 'We wanted to give it to the family, so they can hang it on the next building,' Selectman Mark Sullivan said. The . Kourtidis family, the owners of the 108-year-old facility for more than . 25 years, said it was 'devastated' by the fire, but said helping the . couples who booked the venue for future weeks was their 'first . priority.' 'We want all of . our brides and grooms and customers to know that they are our first . priority. We are dedicated to making sure that they still have the . wedding or event of their dreams,' the family said in a statement. Firefighters respond to a multiple alarm fire at the popular Lakeview Pavilion in Foxboro, Mass., Saturday, April 5, 2014 . The facility first opened on July 4, 1906 as Lake View Park, complete with a dance hall pavilion, dining room, theater and bandstand, under the ownership of the Ross family, according to the facility’s website. It changed hands several times over the years and was purchased by Efstathios 'Steve' and Kiparisia 'Kathy' Kourtidis in 1988, when it was known as Lakeview Ballroom. The facility was renamed to Lakeview Pavilion and is managed by the couple’s daughters, Anastasia Tsoumbasnos and Natalia Kapourelakos. The popular wedding venue had undergone renovations in recent years. Patricia Kissinger, who lives down the road, said she felt badly for the owners. 'We heard a lot of fire engines and ambulances coming down the road and after 10 or so knew it was something serious,' she said. 'They just kept coming. It’s just so sad, this is such a beautiful, historic place. We all love it. And the owners have been so good to the neighborhood.'","It's believed the fire started when a tossed cigarette was thrown onto some mulch .

It was the pride of the Sunderland shipyards before being used to save Soviet civilians from the German onslaught during the Second World War - but now this cargo vessel lies rusting at the bottom of the Black Sea. The Bryansk, a 100-metre-long ship used by the Soviet navy before being sunk by the Nazis, has sat on the Odessa Bay seabed, near Ukraine's southern coast, for 73 years. Now a diver and underwater photographer has captured a series of stunning images of the 116-year-old steam ship's rusting hulk - which has now been home to the Bay's jellyfish and rays for far longer than it was ever in service.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . An Oklahoma father is fighting to get custody of his twin daughters after their little brother was allegedly beaten to death by his estranged wife's boyfriend. Brian Dockery said he and his wife, Tennille Downey, moved the family to Alaska over a year ago to be nearer her family, but the relationship broke down and he moved back to his native Oklahoma last June without his three children. But on March 21, police were called to his Downey's Wasilla home because 23-month-old Ezekiel had stopped breathing. Downey's boyfriend, Jyzyk Sharpe, who had been watching the children while Downey was at work, was arrested Friday and charged with second-degree murder by extreme indifference and manslaughter in Ezekiel's death. The 40-year-old said the toddler slipped getting into the bath but the medical examiner's office found his injuries - several cuts, broken ribs and bruises on both lungs - were not consistent with a fall. Scroll down for video . Tragic: Little Ezekiel Dockery, pictured, was beaten to death while at his mother's house in Alaska last month . 'I can't believe that an adult could be so vicious to a child so innocent and so sweet,' Dockery told News 9. 'Why was he trusted in a home with my children?' Wasilla Police Department officers responded to an East Quincy Circle home just after 1 p.m. where police had been told CPR was in progress on Dockery. The boy was taken to Mat-Su Regional Medical Center, where he was pronounced dead shortly before 2 p.m. 'At the hospital, I observed Jyzyk Sharpe stuttering and displaying involuntary body movements, and (he) was unable to articulate his thoughts,' investigator Daniel Bennett wrote in a criminal complaint. He added that Sharpe's aunt and uncle who knew him very well reported that they had not seen such behavior from him in the past.' Sharpe told the investigator that Ezekiel fell while climbing into the bath to join his sisters. He said he was undressing to join them when he heard a smack. 'Sharpe was talking about (Dockery) and stated, ""I saw him step over, and I could hear a fall, (a-a) slippery fall, I walk over and look and it was a split second, you just knew instantly, instantly, instantly,""' Bennett wrote, according to KTUU.com. After the alleged fall, Sharpe said he . brought the child to a bed, called his mother and 911 and began . performing CPR. He told Bennett he'd broken the child's ribs during CPR. Heartbroken: Brian Dockery, pictured at his son's memorial service, is devastated after the death . Fight: Dockery is now fighting to get custody of his twin daughters Ava, and Veloria Dockery, pictured with their brother . Downey denies that Sharpe would have intentionally hurt the boy. She told police she had been traveling home fro work in Anchorage when she received the frantic call. 'I asked (Downey) if she had any suspicion that (Sharpe) hurt her child at all,' Bennett wrote in the complaint. '(Downey) stated that she did not have any suspicion that (Sharpe) would hurt her . children because he takes care of the kids as if they were his own.' In a sweep of the residence, police found a blood smear in the master bedroom, which tested positive to Ezekiel's blood. they also found a glass plate with white powder on it, that tested positive to cocaine. Downey told investigators the drug was hers not Sharpe's and that the blood stain was from when the twins had pushed Ezekiel down, slitting his lip. According to KTUU, Ezekiel suffered bruises around his head and back, lacerations to his lips, a fractured rib and a tear of his aorta arch, all of which are indicate 'major blunt force trauma.' The medical examiner said the injuries were more consistent with 'a victim in a car accident' rather than a fall or CPR. Dockery's family held a memorial service in Seminole last Monday for the little boy who would have turned two on April 18. The Swearingen funeral home was covered in pictures of Ezekiel's smiling face. Lost: 'Ezekiel was a beautiful, pure, innocent spirit,' the toddler's aunt Natasha Parks said of the boy, pictured. 'We were robbed of his life. The suffering is unspeakable and we're utterly devastated' Twins: 'I think they've endured enough. I'm ready for them to come home. Their home is here with me and my family,' Dockery said of his daughters, pictured. A proper funeral however, is on hold. The family told News 9 that Ezekiel's body is in a holding room in . Alaska and cannot be buried until around June because the ground needs . to thaw out. Dockery said he hopes to bring his son's body to Oklahoma and have him buried in Seminole. 'Ezekiel . was a beautiful, pure, innocent spirit,' the toddler's aunt Natasha . Parks told News 9. 'We were robbed of his life. The suffering is . unspeakable and we're utterly devastated.' The family want Ezekiel's 4-year-old daughters to come back to Seminole. 'I think they've endured enough. I'm ready for them to come home. Their home is here with me and my family,' Dockery said. 'And I'm not going to stop until I get my girls.' Parks described the plight as 'the biggest fight of our lives.' 'It's too late for Ezekiel, but it's not too late for Ava and Veloria,' she said. 'We love them dearly, and we need justice for Ezekiel.' Sharpe is due in court for a hearing on April 14.

Devastated family members have paid tribute to a 13-year-old honor student who plummeted to his death from a 15th-floor hotel balcony as he and his family were wrapping up their Florida vacation. Zach Dickman, from Plainfield, Indiana, was checking out of the Palazzo Condominiums in Panama City with his mother, Rita, and grandparents when he realized he had left his phone in their room. He returned to theroom to retrieve it, but as the 7th grader searched for the device, he somehow fell to his gruesome death from the balcony down to a pool deck below. When he failed to meet his family, his grandmother went to check on him and made the heartbreaking discovery. Loss: Zachary Dickman, pictured with his mother Rita, has died after falling from a hotel balcony . Don Dickman, the boy's great-uncle, said he heard about the tragedy late on Saturday.

Dickman, himself a police officer, . said the Panama City Beach police told him that no foul play is . suspected 'and that it was just a horrible accident'. He . continued: 'I asked if any family members were witnesses, and thank . goodness none of the family saw it happen. Right now we are all . heartbroken and devastated.' He said that the family left Florida for their home in Indiana on Sunday. Friends and relatives also flocked to his mother's Facebook page to pay tribute to her beloved son.

But grieving relatives who saw her body before Tuesday’s cremation in Port Elizabeth described horrific injuries from the cricket bat, and entry wounds from 9mm bullets fired by Pistorius. They were also briefed about the model’s death by police and lawyers from the state prosecutor’s office. In a sworn affidavit read to the bail hearing in Pretoria magistrates’ court last week, Pistorius claimed that he used the bat to break down the toilet door after the shooting, saying he had not realised his girlfriend was in  the bathroom. The bloodstained bat, which is currently being examined by a police forensics team, will be key evidence when Pistorius goes on trial for premeditated murder. The ‘Blade Runner’ – who has previously boasted about having a cricket bat, pistol and machine gun at home to defend himself against intruders – claims the bat became blood-spattered at the scene. Last week the prosecution did not mention any details about the bat and the role they believe it played in Reeva’s death, opting not to disclose their case against Pistorius. But to secure bail, Pistorius’s legal team had to detail his defence, which included why he had a blood-spattered cricket bat in his possession on the fatal night. The athlete claims that during the night he heard a noise in the bathroom and feared it was an intruder. Pistorius, 26, said he felt ‘vulnerable’ without his prosthetic legs, so he got a gun from under his bed and fired through the bathroom door, shouting at the ‘intruder’ to get out of the house and for Reeva to call the police. At that point Pistorius thought she was still in bed. Pistorius described his ‘horror and fear’ as he realised Reeva was not in the bed, and said he used the bat to break down the toilet door to find Reeva slumped inside the cubicle. He said he called paramedics and then carried Reeva, 29, downstairs, trying to revive her, but she died in his arms. Yesterday, Reeva’s father Barry Steenkamp said that the athlete would have to ‘live with his  conscience’ if he is lying about how he killed her. Paralympian Oscar Pistorius is at home after being granted bail following a gruelling four-day hearing . He told Afrikaans-language newspaper Beeld: ‘It doesn’t matter how much money he has and how good his team of lawyers is, he must be able to live with his conscience if he allows his team of lawyers to lie on his behalf. ‘He will have to live with his conscience. But if he speaks the truth, I can perhaps someday forgive him. If it does not happen as he tells it, he must suffer.’ In another interview, Reeva’s mother June said: ‘Everything  has been taken away from me in such a terrible way. The only thing that matters now is the truth.’ Reeva Steenkamp's father, Barry Steenkamp, said Pistorius 'will have to live with his conscience' if he turns out to be lying about her death . Pistorius’s family believe him  to be . innocent, with his father Henke saying he had ‘zero doubt’ that Reeva’s . death was a tragic accident. In an earlier interview, Henke said: ‘When . you are a sportsman, you act even more  on instinct. It’s instinct, things happen and that’s what you do. ‘When you wake up in the middle of the night, and crime is so endemic in South Africa, what do you do if somebody is in the house? Do you think it’s one of your  family? No, of course you don’t.’ In a statement yesterday Pistorius’s family said: ‘Oscar will never be the same  .  .  .  having to live with the knowledge he caused the death of the woman he loved, and that he can never undo the immense pain and loss this has caused Reeva’s family and friends.’ Having been released from bail after the gruelling four-day hearing, Pistorius was yesterday spending the day with his family at a secret address in Pretoria provided by his legal team. His uncle Arnold Pistorius said: ‘We are convinced Oscar’s version of what happened that terrible night will prove to be true.’ Today, if his athletics coach Ampie Louw has his way, Pistorius could be back in training at the track at the University of Pretoria. He was last there earlier this month with Reeva, who watched admiringly as he was put through his paces. Friends have spoken of the need for a suicide watch on the sportsman as he spends the next four months preparing for his court appearance on June 4. Meanwhile, South Africa’s top detective Lieutenant General Vinesh Moonoo is taking over the role of chief investigator in the case, after Hilton Botha stepped down from the post. Detective Botha resigned after seven charges of attempted murder against him were reinstated. He and three other officers shot at a minibus of escaping murder suspects in 2009. By ALAN DERSHOWITZ, celebrity lawyer who successfully defended O.J. Simpson . Lawyer Alan Dershowitz says Pistorius may have won bail at the risk of compromising his future freedom . This weekend, Oscar Pistorius is . walking free in South Africa. The prospect of being caged in prison has . receded, at least for the moment. Beyond his sporting prowess, Pistorius has been a national hero, an inspirational role model, and, above all, a global celebrity. Yet that could prove his downfall, as Pistorius, like so many celebrities, is focused on living for the moment. By securing his freedom today, he may have taken a huge gamble with his future liberty. It is, perhaps, the fatal flaw  of a celebrity in the legal  cross-hairs: a fixation on the immediate repair of their tarnished image, rather than a long-term strategy best suited to their ultimate freedom. I have represented dozens  of celebrities in the US – professional athletes, film  stars, mega-wealthy tycoons, musicians and political figures. People ask me all the time: Does being a celebrity help or hurt the case? Well, sometimes it helps, sometimes it hurts, but it is never irrelevant. Representing a celebrity poses distinct challenges to a lawyer. Celebrities often care more about today than tomorrow. They are concerned about the immediate impact of the case on their image.Pistorius’s image is worth millions of dollars and every day that passes reduces that value. I am certain that he instructed his lawyers to get him out on bail now, even if  that meant compromising his longer-term chances of freedom. The best proof of  that is the unusual affidavit he signed, laying out his defence  in some detail. He was not required to do that, but I’m certain his lawyer told him that he would increase his chances of getting bail if he put forward a plausible defence. However, there are great risks in submitting an affidavit before all the forensic evidence is in. Scientific evaluation of  the crime scene may show inconsistencies with the defence proffered in the affidavit. That would hurt Pistorius further down the line. Alan Dershowitz said the Pistorius legal team went into unusual detail in his affadavit in a bid to win bail . When a celebrity is placed on trial, the legal system often becomes distorted. This is true even in a country such as South Africa, which does not have trial by jury. Professional judges, though they often deny it, are also influenced by their perception of the defendant, which they have garnered not from the evidence, but from the media and from watching the celebrity perform. Judges go out of their  way to pronounce from the bench that they will not be influenced by the defendant’s notoriety. Methinks they protest too much. When I represent a celebrity,  I base my actions on the belief that celebrity matters. Oscar Pistorius is not only a celebrity, he is a beloved son of South Africa; a man who overcame significant handicaps; a hero. Celebrities’ lawyers are often too anxious to please their clients and sometimes sacrifice professionalism in the interests of not being fired. I’m not suggesting that filing the affidavit in Pistorius’s case was an example of this, but I am saying that the defence lawyer should have been darn sure that his client was telling him the truth before he allowed him to lock in his story so early. Most lawyers would not have submitted such an affidavit. But the defence attorney knows more than I what is in the public record and may have made the right decision. In granting Pistorius bail, the judge drew attention to the affidavit – so the trial lawyer’s tactic worked in the short term. Only time will tell whether it will work in the long term.

"By . Jessica Jerreat . Talk show host and comedian Bill Maher sparked controversy during his Friday night show when he warned against crossing the 'gay mafia'. His comments, made on the online-only segment of Real Time, were made as the panel discussed how the Mozilla chief executive had been forced to stand down over his support of a ban on gay marriage. Maher responded to the discussion on the HBO show by saying: 'I think there is a gay mafia. I think if you cross them you do get whacked.' Controversial: Bill Maher made his comments about the 'gay mafia' on Real Time . Video Source HBO . His warning of a 'gay mafia' came as guests on the show discussed how a donation Brendan Eich had made to a group campaigning against Proposition 8 led to him having to leave Mozilla. 'So this guy apparently does not want gay people to get married, and he had to step down. What do you think of that?' Maher asked the panel. Republican Tom Davis, a guest on the show, replied: 'I guess he gave $1,000 eight years ago, and it's come back to haunt him.' Footage of the show, shown on Blaze, showed the guests laughing as Maher made his 'gay mafia' comment, but on Twitter there was shock that the host had referred to the LGBT community as the 'gay mafia'. While some tweets appeared to back Maher's claims, others saw it as a sign of the inequality still faced, with many tweeting 'the struggle continues'. Eich's abrupt departure from Mozilla has stirred the debate over the fairness of forcing out a highly qualified technology executive over his personal views and a single campaign contribution six years ago. And it raises questions about how far corporate leaders are allowed to go in expressing their political views. The National Organization for Marriage, which backed California's same-sex marriage ban, called on consumers to boycott the Firefox browser. Inequality: California's Proposition 8 essentially banned same-sex couples from getting married until it was deemed unconstitutional . Organization president Brian Brown said Eich had been the 'target of a vicious character attack by gay activists who have forced him out of the company he has helped lead for years'. Mozilla chairwoman Mitchell Baker touched on the delicate balancing act in her Thursday post announcing Eich's resignation. 'Mozilla believes both in equality and freedom of speech. Equality is necessary for meaningful speech. And you need free speech to fight for equality. Figuring out how to stand for both at the same time can be hard,' she wrote.","Real Time host made comments to guests on program .

"By . Lizzie Edmonds . A cafe that uses leftover food thrown out by restaurants and supermarkets to create meals has opened its doors. The Real Junkfood Project in Leeds, West Yorkshire, only serves meals created from food destined for landfill. Numerous restaurants, supermarkets and cafes in the city have now got behind the scheme and donate food on a daily basis after they were approached by project leaders. Team members at the Real Junkfood Project look through a parcel of food donated by a local restaurant . Director Connor Walsh outside the cafe in Leeds. The team approached restaurants and cafes across the city as asked them to give their leftover food to the project rather than throw it away . A vegetable curry prepared from ingredients which would have otherwise gone to waste . Volunteers collect the . unwanted food and turn it into their own meals  - which vary each day but . normally include a meat and vegetarian option, sandwiches and sometimes a . dessert. Unwanted food donated so far . ranges from bread and broccoli to caviar, truffles, a kilo of smoked . salmon, luxury cheeses, extravagant veg and spices. Customers at the radical restaurant, thought to be the first in the country, then pay what they want for the food. The cafe was founded by chef Adam Smith - who opened the cafe in December. Since then, he has been joined by five more directors plus an army of volunteers, with 50 signing up last week alone. Sam Joseph, 24 student and co - director of the project works to prepare a meal. So far, unwanted salmon, caviar and truffles have been donated to the restaurant . Connor Walsh, another of the cafe's co-directors, with some donated vegetables.

Mains -Cheese toastieVegetable and lentil dahlChickpea pasta saladJacket potatoesSteak pie and mash . Pudding -JellyChocolate sponge . Drinks -Fruit smoothie . Menus change every day. Food on offer is seasonal and depends on what is donated . The cafe is now open five days a week to serve breakfast and dinner. It has also started catering for outside events. Mr Smith believes by February this year his cafe could have saved a tonne of food from going to waste. One of the cafe's Directors Connor Walsh, 23, said: 'We get a real mix here from locals in the areas, who come in a spend the day here to students. 'We are very busy and are probably doing between 15 to 30 meals a day. 'The pay as you feel concept makes people think about what is offer and what they think it is worth. 'We like to think if somebody has a little more money they might pay a little more. 'But if a person did not have the means . to pay we are not going to not serve them, if they are hungry we are . going to give them food. Two chefs get to work on making one of their recycled meals. The project deploys volunteers every day to go to numerous supermarkets and restaurants across the city to pick up any leftovers . A House of Lords European Union Committee  today released a report into food waste. It reported that 15m tonnes of food is wasted every year in the UK. Committee chairwoman Baroness Scott said food waste was 'clearly a huge issue' in the UK and Europe, adding: 'Not only is it morally repugnant, but it has serious economic and environmental implications. 'The fact that 90m tonnes of food is wasted across the EU each year shows the extent of the problem and explains why we are calling for urgent action.' The report  called for greater education of shoppers - highlighting that 37 per cent of people do not know the difference between 'best before' and 'use by' dates.It also included a five-year action plan on how to reduce waste across the EU. The report also suggested that supermarkets were passing on waste to shoppers by use of special offers such as By One Get One Free. 'Sometimes if customers don't have money they will help out for a couple of hours, invest some of their time.' Connor said they are now operating a food bank from the premises as well. He added: 'We want to make use of all this food that is being needlessly wasted over society. 'We want to provide healthy meals for people who are food insecure. Using food collected that basically gets sent to landfill.' Connor said he hoped to see similar cafes around the country and 'feed more people and raise awareness of food waste'. Co-director Edd Colbert, 23, is . juggling the cafe with his degree in international development - . specialising in the politics of food. He said 'pay as you feel' is a means of bridging the barrier between producers and consumers. He . said: 'You have someone who pays 50p for a sandwich, sitting next to . someone who pays Â£10 or someone who can't afford a bag of crisps in any . other establishment and eats for free. 'Waste of any kind - whether food or energy - is really an immoral situation to be in.' Student and volunteer Jessica Marie Bull, 20, cooks some of the donated food ready for customers .

"By . Martin Robinson . Rail deaths: Charlotte Thompson (left) and Olivia Bazlinton (right) were killed by a train in 2005, a tragedy which has led to 500 of the most dangerous crossings being shut by 2019 . Britain's 500 most dangerous level crossings are to be shut after nine were killed and hundreds narrowly avoided death in the past year alone, it was revealed today. Almost £110million has been set aside for the purge, which will also pay for new bridges, underpasses, gates and signs to make the thousands of others across the UK safer. Cash will also be spent developing technology to make them more secure. But how to stop reckless pedestrians and motorists who still cross despite gates crashing down and alarms sounding remains a major problem. There are 7,000 in the UK and for years there has been growing pressure to act following a spate of deaths. This has been spearheaded by the parents of Olivia Bazlinton, 14, and her friend Charlotte . Thompson, 13, who died when they were hit by a train in 2005 as they crossed . the tracks at Elsenham station footpath crossing in Essex. It emerged afterwards that four years before they were killed a safety official had raised concerns about the possibility of a tragedy there but it was ignored. Just last week Chris Bazlinton told MPs at a special hearing that he had received ‘shabby’ treatment following the incident eight years ago and ‘not much has changed at Network Rail in the way that they treat . these incidents’. Last year rail bosses were fined £1million for health and safety breaches. Announcing rail funding for the 2014 to 2019 period today, the Office of Rail Regulation (ORR) said it would be increased by £32million, to close around 500 . level crossings within six years. Total funding will now be £109 million. Hard fight: Reg Thompson (left), father of Charlotte, alongside Chris Bazlinton, Olivia's father, speaks outside Basildon Magistrates' Court after winning their six-year legal battle to get justice for their children . Dangerous: The Railway crossing at Elsenham Train station in Essex, where the two girls were killed, and a safety expert's concerns were ignored . In total, NR will receive more than £21billion over the next five years to fund the day-to-day running of the rail network. The ORR will require the company to bring down the cost of running the network by around 20 per cent. The regulators have given the green light . to more than £12billion worth of enhancements to Britain's rail network . to ease congestion and improve performance on the railways. Also, the ORR will put additional checks . in place to monitor the company's progress on making the network more . resilient to bad weather and climate change. Tougher punishments: New rules will demand better punctuality, after it emerged in August that one in three trains in Britain is late and on some routes more than half fail to arrive on time . Rail regulators have said 90 per cent of trains must run on time over the next five years. The tough targets set out by Network Rail applies to all regional, London and south east England and Scottish services starting in April 2014. On long-distance routes, First Great Western must run 90 per cent of trains on time while a target of 88 per cent has been set for the two main London to Scotland routes - the East Coast and West Coast main lines. The Office of Rail Regulation (ORR) said that by 2019 fewer than three in 100 trains on the West Coast line and around four in 100 on the East Coast line should be hit by cancellation or delays of more than 30 minutes. ORR chief executive Richard Price said: 'Network Rail has made great strides in improving safety, performance and efficiency on Britain's railways. 'Supported by significant levels of funding from governments, working more closely with the rest of the industry, and learning important lessons from the past, the company is capable of delivering more for customers and taxpayers.' He went on: 'This plan for Britain's railways between 2014 and 2019 - informed by the public, consumer groups, governments and the industry - requires a safer, higher-performing and more-efficient railway. 'More level crossings will be upgraded or closed; passengers will enjoy better punctuality and suffer fewer cancellations; customers should have a say in shaping billions of pounds of new investment on the network; and the company will continue to bring down the day-to-day costs of running the railways . 'With increased levels of funding in vital areas such as safety and closer monitoring from the regulator, we expect . 'Network Rail to build on past successes and beat the challenges we have set.'","Regulator sets aside £110m after 9 deaths and 400 near misses in past year .

"By . Lydia Warren . An orthopedic surgeon often slapped anesthetized patients on the buttocks so hard that he left red marks or hand prints, according to a federal complaint. Michael Clarke, 47, also allegedly insulted some of his patients, calling them 'fat [expletive]', and discussed graphic sexual acts with staff in the operating room, witnesses told investigators. St. Joseph's Hospital Health Center in Syracuse, New York also faces . sanctions following claims they did nothing about his behavior, and it could be terminated from the . Medicare and Medicaid programs. Clarke, a married orthopedic surgeon who specializes in hip replacement, was not identified in the federal report, but a complaint filed in January with the state Health Department identifies him and the details of the two complaints match up, according to the Syracuse Post-Standard. Investigation: Michael Clarke, an orthopedic surgeon, allegedly slapped the buttocks of patients after he put them under anesthetic - but claimed he was simply checking to see if the anesthetic had worked . The state health department's findings are the basis of the federal report. It says that 11 members of staff told investigators that Clarke sometimes slapped the patients, while eight of these also said he used sexually explicit language. One worked said the doctors would 'almost wind up' before slapping a patient. But Clarke said he was simply doing his job, according to the report, which names him 'Physician #1.' 'Physician #1 explained it was how he/she . checked for the adequacy of the patient's spinal anesthesia,' it says. 'All 11 . staff indicated they had never seen another physician use the slap . method to check the adequacy of a spinal and that Physician #1 did not . slap all hip replacement patients.' A member of staff reported the doctor's behavior . to administrators early last year, according to a report by the federal . Center for Medicare & Medicaid Services. Scene: St Joseph's Hospital in Syracuse, New York also faces repercussions for allegedly failing to respond adequately enough to staff members' complaints about the surgeon . But they said the hospital did nothing, while others said they did not come forward about how he treated patients because they did not think anything would be done or feared losing their jobs. Clarke, who lives in Manlius, operated at St. Joe's until he moved to Crouse Hospital in February. The Onondaga County District Attorney's Office is also investigating him for possible criminal conduct and they expect to complete their investigation in two weeks. But St Joe's said that administrators took prompt action after learning of the doctor's behavior and the report states that Clarke was told to stop slapping patients and he was monitored at work. But it also adds that the hospital assigned . four staffers to monitor the doctor without fully instructing them how to do so, meaning that their results were incomplete. Clarke's lawyer said his client denies wrongdoing but won't comment on the investigation.","Michael Clarke, 47, 'insulted his anesthetized patients and wound his arm up before slapping them across the backsides'

"By . Lizzie Edmonds . Mafia mobsters are not all psychopaths despite their reputation for being gangsters who kill, traffic drugs and kidnap, a new study claims. Italian researchers Schimmenti and colleagues, who are based in the birthplace of the mafia Sicily, went to a prison in Palermo to interview 30 convicted mobsters. They questioned 39 prisoners in the same institution who were jailed for non gang-related crimes. The researchers then used the Hare Psychopathy Checklist (PCL-R) to determine whether any of the subjects showed psychotic characteristics. Marlon Brando as Don Vito Corleone in The Godfather (1972). Researchers have found that of 30 mafia mobsters they interviewed, none showed psychopathic characteristics . The 20-item list of personality traits and recorded behaviors associated with psychopathy - such as pathological lying, lack of empathy and an impulsive nature - is a common assessment used to determine whether someone has the personality disorder. Interviewees are assessed and given a score - with those marked above 30 being deemed a psychopath. The researchers discovered that none of the Mafia members they questioned scored over 30. Conversely, 10 per cent of the comparative group did. The report observed of the mafia members: 'This means that they were less ‘manipulative’, ‘Machiavellian’, ‘narcissistic’, ‘unemotional’, ‘parasitic’ and/or ‘impulsive’ than the other participants. 'Further, during the interviews, they often expressed concerns for their children and their families, and they had never ceased to write and call them. Such expressions of attachment were less apparent among the comparison men.'Even criminal actions for most of the Mafia members were led by loyalty to their families or adherence to the family’s ‘mission’ rather than personal interest. Palermo, Sicily - where the researchers who conducted the study, Schimmenti and colleagues, are based . 'It is possible that these individuals compartmentalized their lives and behaviors –on the one side, the Mafia affairs, on the other side, their positive feelings and affects towards relatives and friends.' The study also noted that Mafia members are less likely to have substance abuse problems than others in prison. Of the mafia members, the researchers found 57 per cent had been jailed for violent offenses, 23 per cent for murder and the remainder for crimes such as kidnapping, trafficking drugs and fraud.","Italian researchers questioned convicted mobsters in Palermo jail .

"By . Caroline Graham . Updated: . 16:59 EST, 31 December 2011 . Mark Kennedy spent eight years posing as eco-warrior Mark 'Flash' Stone . An undercover police officer has defended having sexual relationships with unsuspecting eco-activists, saying they were ‘essential’ to maintaining a convincing cover story. Mark Kennedy, who spent eight years posing as eco-warrior Mark ‘Flash’ Stone,  has spoken out after learning that three women plan to sue the Metropolitan Police for emotional distress, saying he ‘duped’ them into sex. ‘I never conned anyone into having sex,’ he says. ‘I lived undercover for eight years and if I hadn’t had sex, I would have blown my cover. But I never used these women to gain information. The love we had was real. ‘I am not the first man to give a false name to a woman. I do have sympathy for those I may have hurt but this doesn’t warrant a lawsuit. The world of eco-activism is highly promiscuous. It was essential for me to have relationships in order to do my job.’ In total, eight women are accusing five undercover officers, including Kennedy, of causing them ‘intense emotional trauma and pain’. The lawsuit, thought to be the first of its kind, alleges the ‘degrading deceit’ caused them psychiatric and psychological injuries, including depression, anxiety and trauma. It states: ‘It appears that [the men] used techniques they had been trained in to gain trust .  .  . officers obtained the consent of [these women] to sexual intercourse by deceit.’ Kennedy’s cover was blown a year ago and he has since left the police and moved to America, where he is working on a book and has signed a lucrative film deal. A Channel  4 documentary about him, Confessions Of An Undercover Cop, aired in November. In 2002, Kennedy, 42, was recruited by the Met’s National Public Order Intelligence Unit and travelled throughout Britain and Europe, infiltrating activist groups as long-haired, tattooed protester Stone. Kennedy, who is now getting divorced, insists he was celibate during his first year undercover.  ‘I avoided sexual contact, despite the fact that free love is part of that lifestyle,’ he says. ‘I was a new face with money and a van, so I was a catch but I said I’d just ended a relationship and was recovering emotionally.’ In fact, Kennedy was married to Edel, mother of his 12-year-old son and ten-year-old daughter, though he claims he and his wife stayed together only because of the children. ‘The subject of sex came up once during training,’ says Kennedy. ‘It was basically “Don’t do it.” But I talked to my cover officer dozens of times a day. There is no way he could not have known about a relationship. I told him where I was going and with whom. He knew where I spent my nights. I didn’t have to spell it out to him. I couldn’t go to the loo without him knowing. The police chose to turn a blind eye because the intelligence I was providing was so good.’ Dirty protesters: A picture of female mud-wrestlers taken by Mark Kennedy. Kennedy's cover for the £2million operation was blown after a high-profile trial of eco-activists collapsed amid allegations that he had been organising the very protests he was being paid to help stop . Kennedy says that his first sexual encounter came with a woman who ‘seduced’ him at a party in Leeds in 2003. He believes she is one of  his lawsuit accusers, although the women’s identities are not being  disclosed. ‘She came up and planted a huge kiss on me,’ he says. ‘One thing led to another and we ended up in bed. We had an on-off sexual relationship for two years. The lawsuit makes it sound as if I was predatory but I treated the women lovingly. ‘I am surprised she states we were in a relationship from 2003 to 2005. She had multiple lovers and I didn’t consider her a proper girlfriend. ‘I knew I had crossed the line by having sex with the people I was infiltrating but I felt I had little choice. One activist told me, “If a man doesn’t respond to sexual overtures, then it is likely he’s a cop or informant.” ’ He says the louche lifestyle promoted casual sex. ‘No one worked, so there was a party lifestyle, filled with drink and drugs like ecstasy, ketamine and marijuana,’ he says. ‘It was not unusual to have 100 to 150 people passing through a party lasting two or three days. There would always be a big bowl of condoms on the bar. They were vegan ones because regular condoms can contain animal by-products.’ Kennedy says that the sex-filled parties often had a theme. ‘At one party, called M&S / S&M, you had to wear something from Marks & Spencer with a sadomasochistic theme – the women were wearing cardigans with their breasts hanging out. At another, called the Queer Option, everyone cross-dressed – it was a case of anything goes. Undercover as an eco-activist in Spain in 2007. Kennedy says he never indulged in the sexual free-for-all because, by 2004, he had fallen in love with a red-haired Welsh activist . ‘The parties would end in a mass of arms and legs as people got into the free-love thing.’ He says children would frequently be present. ‘The parties would go on for days. One party had semi-naked mud-wrestlers and there were children wandering in and out, fascinated by all the high jinks.’ Kennedy says he never indulged in the sexual free-for-all because, by 2004, he had fallen in love with a red-haired Welsh activist to whom he remained devoted until his cover was blown. ‘I believe she is one of the women in the lawsuit,’ he says, sitting in a hotel near his home in Cleveland, Ohio. ‘When we met she was involved with another man but I was smitten. She ended things with her other boyfriend and we were totally in love with each other.’ He says he felt ‘terrible guilt’ in hiding his identity from her.  ‘I wanted to tell her, but I couldn’t. ‘I never used any information she gave me. To be frank, I had much better sources. After my identity was revealed, we met up and I told her how sorry I was. I thought we had made our peace. ‘This lawsuit is about money and politics. I was exposed and I admitted having these two relationships [of the third woman who cites a relationship with him between  February and September 2005, he says, “I haven’t a clue who that is”]. ‘They are trying to discredit undercover police officers. Some people may have pound signs in their eyes, too. Perhaps they think the Met will pay them to go away.’ Kennedy’s cover for the £2 million operation was blown after a high-profile trial of eco-activists collapsed amid allegations that he had been organising the very protests he was being paid to help stop. He too is planning a lawsuit against the Met. ‘The police did not properly support me. I did not receive the proper psychiatric counselling  during my eight years undercover and when my cover was blown, the police hung me out to dry,’ he says. ‘I lost my job, my girlfriend, my life. I will be suing for the emotional distress that caused.’ A Scotland Yard spokesman last night responded to Kennedy’s claims via email, saying: ‘There is a review under way led by Deputy Assistant Commissioner Mark Simmons which is assessing various issues arising from covert deployments over the period 1968-2008. ‘This is a complex process due to the elapsed time, the nature and volume of material and the inherent sensitivity of the issues.’ Harriet Wistrich, the lawyer representing the women, said: ‘There is a huge difference between not being totally honest about who you are and being an undercover policeman spying on your lover’s activities and those of her friends and associates. ‘There is no way that any of the claimants would have considered an intimate relationship with a man if they knew what his real job was . Kennedy was trained by the police to lie and deceive in order to gather information, as were the four other officers . ‘What he and the other officers did to these women and what his bosses either sanctioned or turned a blind eye to was unlawful, sexist and has caused real psychological damage to those involved.’",Mark Kennedy spent eight years posing as Mark 'Flash' Stone but his cover was blown a year ago .
"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A California high school wrestling coach has been suspended after video emerged of him using wrestling moves as he subdued a male student in a classroom on Friday. Mark Black had been teaching his science class when it allegedly came to his attention that the unnamed student had drugs in his possession. A confrontation ensued and video shows what happened thereafter, but what seems like a case of a teacher going too far has some of Black's colleagues cheering him on. Scroll down for video . Shocking? A shocking physical altercation between student and teacher was caught on a cell phone camera Friday . In a letter sent to parents by Santa Monica-Malibu Unified School District, Superintendent Sandra Lyon makes her stance that the well-regarded wrestling coach and teacher crossed a line. 'We really don't want teachers putting their hands on other students,' she wrote, calling the 'physical restraint' he used 'unaceptable.' At the heart of the confrontation was the student's alleged marijuana possession. 'The little boy was selling drugs in class,' student Kylan Townsend told KTLA. 'The wrestling coach told him to stop...I guess he didn't listen and tables were thrown. They started fighting.' There were no punches thrown, no kicking, and no yelling during the altercation. However, Black was suspended even before an investigation was conducted. These . facts, paired with the student's alleged illegal activities have some . area students, teachers and parents flocking to Black's side.

'Mr. Black, a wrestling coach with over 30 years experience, placed the student in a restraint hold to stop the student from further attacking him.  This was in an effort to get the situation under control,' it goes on to explain. The Change.org page received nearly 2,000 isgnatures before the weekend was out and the Facebook page 'We support Coach Black of Samohi' had nearly 8,000 likes. 'Mark Black is an incredible man, coach, and mentor who has helped shape my son, and countless students, into incredible loving, responsible young adults,' wrote parent Tanja Elliott on the Change.org petition. On Friday, Lyon wrote: . 'As a parent, I know that we want our children to be safe at school. This is a fundamental expectation that I honor and respect.

The FCV looks ready to hit the streets, not all that different in exterior design from the Prius gas-electric hybrid . Toyota's model will have plenty of competition. Korean rival Hyundai said earlier this week it will start selling a Tucson SUV powered by a fuel cell next year, which if realised will be the first mass-market arrival of the technology. Honda is scheduled to take the wraps off a next-generation version at the Los Angeles Auto Show later this week. The Japanese government, as well as the U.S. and parts of Europe, are getting serious in investing in hydrogen fueling-station infrastructure, which is a must before fuel cells can become practical. Skeptics say hydrogen-fueling stations are even more expensive to build than recharging stations for electric cars, partly because electricity is almost everywhere and new and safe ways for producing, storing and transferring hydrogen as fuel will be needed.

"By . Anna Edwards . Brooks wrote to Coulson: 'I tell you everything, I confide in you, I seek your advice, I love you, care about you, worry about you.' The full letter exposing the affair between Rebekah Brooks and Andy Coulson was given to the phone hacking jury for the first time today. In the letter, Brooks, 45, told Coulson 'I love you' as she pours her heart out over the end of their six-year relationship, it is said. Jurors at the Old Bailey were today handed the two-and-a-half page document - but were required to read in silence the first part of the letter, which will not now be heard in open court. Brooks, seated next to husband Charlie, and Coulson, 46, both stared ahead intently as the document, in which Brooks writes: 'You are my very best friend', was read. Prosecutor Andrew Edis QC then repeated the extract he had already read when he addressed the jury at the start of the trial, in early November. Brooks writes: 'You are my very best friend. I tell you everything, I confide in you, I seek your advice, I love you, care about you, worry about you.' It is claimed the pair, who are on trial for phone hacking together, dated in secret between 1998 and 2004. Mr Edis repeated those passages again in open court today after revealing that the document had been recovered from one of Brooks' computers. Writing to Coulson, she says: 'Finally and the least of our worries, but how do we really work this new relationship? 'There are a hundred things that have happened since Saturday night that I would normally share with you, some important, most trivial. 'The fact is you are my very best . friend. I tell you everything, I confide in you, I seek your advice, I . love you, care about you, worry about you. 'We laugh and cry together. In fact without our relationship in my life, I am really not sure how I will cope. Brooks, seated next to husband Charlie, stared ahead intently as the document, in which she wrote: 'You are my very best friend', was read . 'I'm frightened to be without you, but bearing in mind ""the rules"" you will not know how I am doing and vice versa. 'The thought of finding out anything about you or your life from someone else fills me with absolute dread. 'Also you said I had to email you if anything important happened, like if I was ill? 'I don't understand this, we are either there for each other or not surely? 'Anyway, that really isn't where I am confused. I know what horror it means and I know why we have to stick to it. 'But for example, how does this work thing manifest itself. Rebekah Brooks' phone was hacked 43 times by News of the World investigator Glenn Mulcaire in 2006, the court heard. The convicted phone hacker was also listening to Andy Coulson's voicemails at the same time, even hacking him six times on a single day. Brooks' maiden name, Rebekah Wade, appeared several times in Mulcaire's notes recovered by police. On one page, he had an account number alongside her name, a list of mobile phone service providers, and the word 'Vodafone'. Another page with Brooks' name had her mobile number and the names of ex-husband Ross Kemp and former News International lawyer Tom Crone. Mulcaire had made notes on Coulson but misspelt his name as 'Coulsdon', the court heard. Phone records show that Brooks was hacked 13 times in March 2006, 15 times in April, another ten times in May, and five times in June and July. Coulson was targeted six times on February 1, 2006, and another five times later in the month. His voicemails were hacked another eight times in June and July 2006, the court heard. Mr Edis showed this data in agreed admission presented to the jury at the close of the prosecution case. 'Do we limit contact until we absolutely have to, like leaving our execs to sort run-of-the-mill joint stuff? I don't want to get this wrong. 'I hope that I've managed to put your mind at rest about Les, and that you two now have a better relationship. 'On KRM [Rupert Murdoch], well he's not b*llocking you must not brood on lack of calls. 'Obviously I can't discuss my worries, concerns, problems at work with you anymore, and vice versa, but I'll assume unless I hear different that we keep our professional relationship to the minimum, and avoid if possible without it being in any way awkward. 'If it is necessary or more importantly right that we two editors should deal with it, then we will. If either of us feels that we are not striking this balance then we must say.' The letter was presented to the jury as the prosecution case draws to a close. This is the third time in the trial the unusual step of asking jurors to read evidence in silence has been taken. It was first used over privacy concerns with voicemails left by former Home Secretary David Blunkett, and again for two email exchanges involving journalists at The Sun. The court also heard how Brooks emailed ex-husband Ross Kemp saying they needed to ‘talk about phone hacking’ three weeks before her arrest. The email to the former Eastenders actor was recovered from Brooks’ BlackBerry mobile phone, having been sent at 11.03pm on June 23, 2011. ‘Hello, how are you?’, she wrote. ‘Need to talk to you about phone hacking at some point. When are you free?’ Prosecutor Andrew Edis QC then told jurors that less than half an hour later, Brooks emailed her personal assistants Deborah Keegan and Cheryl Carter saying: ‘Need my 2002/03 diaries.’ The emails were taken off the BlackBerry seized from Brooks when she was first arrested on July 17, 2011. Another email is to Carter on July 8, 2011, saying: ‘Coffee and hot milk please, separately. This is disgusting.’ Jurors at the Old Bailey were today handed the two-and-a-half page document from Brooks to Coulson - but were forced to in silence the first part of the letter, which will not now be heard in open court . Mr Edis said: ‘This is the day of the withdrawal of the notebooks from the archive’, referring to the charge that Brooks and Carter face together. The jury heard many of Brooks’ emails have been lost forever because she did not agree for them to be kept in an archive. The former News International chief executive decided not to ‘opt in’ to an automatic archive system when it was installed in 2005. As a result, very few of her emails over six years at News International including four years as editor of The Sun have been recovered by police. Prosecutor Mark Bryant-Heron told the court: ‘Mrs Brooks never opted in to using News International’s original archive system when it was installed in January 2005. ‘This meant emails on Mrs Brooks’ email account were not retained on the archiving system. ‘Emails sent to her and received from her by other employees would be retained on the system in those users’ own archiving system, unless deleted by that user within 14 days.’ He added the ‘percentage of her account recovered cannot be confirmed.’ The court heard police investigating phone hacking at the News of the World and corruption at The Sun have recovered four batches of emails from the News International system. One was the ‘live email archive’ from 2000 to 2007, there are two systems that have been rebuilt, and a back-up system. The court heard that nearly 4.5m emails from 2005 to 2010 were purged by News International as part of a routine clean-out in September 2010, but 1.49m had subsequently been recovered from other sources. Jurors also heard that Brooks’ old hard drive from her office in Wapping was removed prior to the computer being disposed of. The removal happened after the News International executive moved to new offices in Thomas More Square in January 2011, and were issued with new computers. However, on an audit in May 2011, it was discovered there was no hard drive in Brooks’ now redundant computer. The computer was then thrown away because Brooks’ name was not on a list of phone hacking suspects whose computer equipment was being preserved. After today, the trial will take a break for several days of legal discussions before resuming on Monday, February 17 when the defence cases are due to begin. Rebekah Brooks, of Chipping Norton, Coulson, of Charing, Kent, and Kuttner, of Woodford Green, Essex all deny of one count of conspiracy to intercept communications. Brooks also denies two counts of perverting the course of justice and two counts of conspiracy to commit misconduct in a public office. Coulson, with Clive Goodman, of Woodham, Addlestone, Surrey, also denies two counts of misconduct in a public office. Carter, of Chelmsford, Essex, Hanna, of Buckingham, Bucks, and Charles Brooks, of Chipping Norton all deny conspiracy to pervert the course of justice. The trial has now been adjourned for legal argument until Monday, February 17.

"By . Ellie Buchdahl . Colour: Fake tan has become increasingly popular in Cardiff - or so it seems to letting agents John Winter . It may be the cheap alternative to a sunkissed post-holiday look. But fake tan is costing one Cardiff landlord thousands of pounds as he is forced to replace mattresses and mattress covers 'decorated' by students after that year-long summer glow. John Winter, who manages student lets in Cathays, Cardiff, first noticed the problem about four years ago, according to employee Joe Harris. At the time, the letting agent was having custom-made mattresses that were pocket-sprung, but these were being ruined by the fake tan stains after the colour went through the sheets, according to Mr Harris. 'John [the owner] didn't have a clue . what the strange orange marks were,' he told the BBC. 'They were roughly body shaped and . you could see the wrist, ankle and shoulder areas. 'We try to educate the students and it . has been quite successful because three years ago we had 220 mattress . covers ruined, but this year that's dropped to 147. The company has also started using memory foam matresses because covers can be removed and washed or replaced - 'although . we still have some where the colour has gone right through and ruined . the whole thing'. 'There is a high percentage of females out of the 400 students we house, so the incidents were much higher, and you could see the fake tanning products in nearly every room,' he said. 'I went to one house and was . met by a parade of mattresses being carried down the stairs on the way . to the skip. 'There is a high percentage of . females out of the 400 students we house, so the incidents were much . higher, and you could see the fake tanning products in nearly every . room,"" he said. New mattress covers cost around Â£30 . each, plus VAT. Mr Harris says that he does not see the problem going away until the interest in fake tan wanes. But beautician Carina Barcoe, who works at Blush Hair and Beauty in Birchgrove, Cardiff, said staining can be avoided. Sunkissed: Stars such as Lucy Mecklenburgh from The Only Way Is Essex are famous for their tanned look . 'Fake tanning will wash off sheets,' she said. 'I always recommend wearing loose-fitting pyjamas though, as different products have different developing times.' However, Mr Harris said it was impossible to remove the marks from this mattress.

"By . Hugo Gye . A biker has been filmed performing a series of death-defying tricks inside a hollowed-out mansion on 'Billionaire's Row' in Kensington. Chris Northover rode his dirt bike into the former Russian embassy on Kensington Palace Gardens - reputed to be the most expensive street in Britain - which is now owned by the founder of Foxtons estate agent. Once inside the Grade II-listed building, which is currently undergoing a total renovation, he carried out stunts such as doughnuts, wheelies and jumps before going up to the roof. Scroll down to watch the amazing video . Imposing: Mansion is thought to be worth around £100 million despite needing total renovation . Stunt: Rider used his Oset trials bike to perform doughnuts, wheelies and other tricks throughout the building . Beams: Stunts included balancing over wooden beams where the floorboards had been removed . He sped towards the edge of the roof at high speed, repeatedly braking just in time to stop inches short of a 50ft drop. The . 27 year-old, who works for a biking magazine, also jumped onto the . window ledges, hopping from one to another in a fearless display. But . perhaps the most daunting move of all was abseiling through a skylight . while still on his Oset 20.0 48v trials bike, worth around £1,800. Basement: At one point in the video the rider is seen zipping through arches underneath the house . Balance: Later Northover appears on the roof of the mansion and balances on the apex with his leg ajar . On the edge: He also bounces across the tops of small bay windows . 'It was a really good experience,' said Mr Northover, from Welwyn Garden City in Hertfordshire. 'All that was going through my head when I got up there was don't fall off, as I could be really badly hurt or die. 'But once I started it was like riding on a pavement. I've done a few stunts before but the abseiling bit was was terrifying. 'It was all quite surreal as we were on the roof and people were down on the ground looking up.'The bike was brilliant. They market them as children's bikes but it's really strong and I've had loads of fun with it.' Jump: The daredevil could be seen jumping between windows from the ground without any ropes or safety net . Long way down: Northover considers a shortcut down from the roof through a skylight . Swing: He uses a lanyard to swing through safely into the room below . The house used to be the Russian embassy, but in 2005 it was bought by entrepreneur Jon Hunt for £14million. Mr . Hunt, who founded Foxtons in 1981 and sold it for £390million in 2001, . gave Mr Northover permission to film his stunts in the house last . summer. He is currently carrying out a major programme of renovation on the property, which is now estimated to be worth around £100million. Among the features of the home when it is finally finished are set to be an underground tennis court, health centre and a private motor museum for Mr Hunt's six vintage Ferraris. Steady: Northover used careful control of his brakes to ensure he didn't slip over the edge . Relief: He removes his helmet at the end of the video . The owner is known as a lover of . motorsports - he hosts classic car exhibitions and motorcycle stunt . shows at Heveningham Hall, his country estate in Suffolk. Mr . Northover's video, entitled 'Storm the Embassy', has been viewed more . than 320,000 times since it was first posted on YouTube.

"By . Ben Spencer . Farming leaders last night accused the Government of failing to fulfil its own rhetoric, after the Environment Secretary urged shoppers to buy more British food. Peter Kendall, president of the National Farmers’ Union, said Owen Paterson should be pushing hospitals and schools to buy UK food rather than simply going to the cheapest source. ‘If Owen Paterson is going to get the public to buy British then he should  also get the Government to buy British,’ said Mr Kendall. Conflict: Peter Kendall, president of the National Farmers' Union (left), said Environment Secretary Owen Paterson (right) should do more to get hospitals and schools buying UK food as he urges Britons to shop locally . ‘We had an event at the House of Commons in May last year and they  could not come up with an entirely British menu for us.’ Mr Kendall was speaking at the Oxford Farming Conference yesterday, after Mr Paterson made an impassioned plea calling for a quarter of imported food to be produced in Britain instead. The farming leader added: ‘The message that people should be buying less imported food is great – but it needs to be followed up. ‘British farmers are leading the way by raising standards and producing high-quality food, but those in the public sector need to play their part by making sure they are looking for local quality and not just the cheapest food.’ Mr Paterson agreed more needed to be done to get the public sector to buy British. He told the conference he had appointed Sir Peter Bonfield, an experienced retail leader, to lead a new drive on the public procurement of food. He added: ‘The public sector bought £2.1billion worth of food and drink last year. That’s an astonishing amount of money. 'The public sector should be taking advantage of our top quality products, supporting our world-class farmers.’ He said hospitals and schools should be following the example set by the Countess of Chester Hospital NHS Foundation Trust in Cheshire, which manages to source 92 per cent of its food in the UK. He added that responsibility should also be taken by shoppers to buy home-grown food that is in season. He told the conference: ‘By buying seasonal fruit and veg we can improve the nation’s health, help the environment and boost the economy.’ The Countryside Alliance echoed the NFU’s criticism, and urged the Government to  follow its rhetoric with actions. Sarah Lee, head of policy at the alliance, said: ‘It’s easy to say, “buy British”…but the Government should lead by example.’ Supermarkets said they were using new technology to extend the British growing seasons, making it easier to buy UK food. Mr Paterson acknowledged that complex labelling rules could confuse consumers. Much food labelled as British has been grown or raised elsewhere and then brought into the country for processing.","Enviornment Secretary Owen Paterson urged shoppers to buy UK produce .

"By . Ben Spencer . Defiant: Environment Secretary Owen Paterson insists we will fall behind in farming technology if we outlaw GM techniques . Owen Paterson yesterday launched a stinging attack on those who are concerned about the dangers of genetically-modified food. The Environment Secretary accused those opposed to the development of GM foods as being ‘politically-motivated’ and said blocking the technology risked making the UK a ‘museum of farming’. Critics say that tampering with the genes in crops to create ‘Frankenstein foods’ could damage natural ecosystems or even affect human health. But this month EU politicians are expected to approve the licensing of the first commercial food crop in 15 years using the controversial technology. Mr Paterson will vote to approve the crop - an insect-resistant maize developed jointly by DuPont and Dow Chemical - at a meeting of the European Environment Council. And yesterday the Environment Secretary, speaking at the Oxford Farming Conference, said: ‘If approval is granted, as it should be based on the scientific evidence, then it will be the first GM food crop authorised for planting by the EU for 15 years. ‘Whether or not this vote heralds a breakthrough in the EU’s regulation of GM crops remains to be seen. ‘Delays and blockages have been politically-motivated rather than based on evidence.’ He added: ‘I will continue to make the case for a regime that allows fair market access for products once they have passed Europe’s rigorous, independent scientific assessment. ‘Let me be clear, there are other tools in the toolbox, GM is not a panacea. But the longer that Europe continues to close its doors to GM, the greater the risk that the rest of the world will bypass us altogether. ‘Europe risks becoming the Museum of World Farming as innovative companies make decisions to invest and develop new technologies in other markets.’ Last night anti-GM campaigners responded with fury to Mr Paterson’s claims - and said he was ignoring decades of research that shows the scientific argument for meddling with nature has not yet been won. Peter Melchett, policy director of organic farming group the Soil Association, said: ‘The accusation that opposition to GM is “political” is simply a politician’s way of sidestepping the overwhelming scientific, safety and market arguments against GM. Backlash: Critics attacked Paterson for 'ignoring decades of research' that shows it is bad to meddle with nature . ‘The fact is that no tests are done to check whether GM food is safe for people to eat. ‘Not a single British supermarket has said they will buy GM crops and sell them, and British consumers remain just as opposed to GM food as ever. ‘What Owen Paterson, the UK Government and European regulators do or do not decide about particular GM crops is neither here nor there. ‘Farmers don’t grow what Owen Paterson tells them to grow, and Owen Paterson doesn’t buy what they do grow.’ Friends of the Earth food campaigner Vicki Hird added: ‘Despite decades of research, evidence shows there are still no miracle crops to tackle important issues agriculture faces, such as climate change, soil degradation, water shortages and meeting growing demand. Peter Kendall, president of the National Farmers' Union, said scientists were fleeing to America due to over-regulation . ‘Our farming system certainly needs to change, but this should focus on less-intensive practices that increase agricultural diversity and benefit local people and the environment.’ Innovations in GM technology were, however, backed by the National Farmers Union. NFU president Peter Kendall warned that European scientists were fleeing to America because of over-regulation. He said: ‘They do not believe we are ever going to adopt this technology. We have got to make decisions based on science and not on politics. ‘Boy, have we got to make decisions if we want European agriculture to be globally competitive and not start with the premise that we are going to protect artisan agriculture at all costs.’ He said he was concerned that debate about GM was dominated by ‘myth and scare and no science whatsoever’ and added: ‘We have got to put science in the decision making and reduce the politics.’ If approved, the new crop would be the second GM food product to be grown in the European Union after Monsanto won approval for another insect-resistant corn variety in 1998. The crop is unlikely to be grown in Britain because the insects it has been bred to resist do not live in the country. France, Austria and Italy are among countries expected to oppose approval, while supporters are likely to include Britain, Sweden and Spain. By comparison, GM crops are grown widely in the Americas and parts of Asia. Mr Paterson faces an uphill struggle convincing the British public of GM benefits. A recent survey by the Food Standards Agency found two out of three UK shoppers wanted products from animals fed a GM diet to be labelled.","Critics say playing with genes in 'Frankenstein food' damages ecosystem .

"By . Glen Owen . Norman Baker, pictured last year, is rebelling against civil servants' order that he must be chauffeur-driven between his office and the House of Commons . When politicians are embroiled in rows over Government chauffeurs, it is usually because they have abused the privilege. But not so colourful Home Office Minister Norman Baker, who is rebelling against an order to use a driver by demanding that officials provide him with a ‘ministerial bike’ instead. The Liberal Democrat, whose appointment to Theresa May’s team was the biggest shock of the autumn reshuffle, says civil servants have told him he must be chauffeured the quarter-mile between his desk at the Home Office and the Commons. When he told them that he would rather pedal and asked them to provide a bicycle, they refused – on the grounds that it would be an ‘unacceptable burden’ on the taxpayer. Last night, Mr Baker hit out at what he described as a ‘ridiculous, Yes Ministerish jobsworth’ attitude. ‘I object to the fact that they are trying to put me into a car with a chauffeur against my will,’ he said. ‘I pointed out that it would be much quicker and cheaper for me to cycle. But they said that while the car was already paid for, providing a bike would be an additional cost to the taxpayer. It’s nonsense. ‘It would be cheaper and also better for the environment.’ Mr Baker, 56, added: ‘I could provide my own bike, but I regard it is a matter of principle.’ It is understood that the row has gone all the way to Sue Gray, the  Cabinet Office’s Director General of Propriety and Ethics, who has backed the officials. And last night the Home Office, which spends £136,000 a year on chauffeuring its Ministers around, was sticking to its guns. One of Mr Baker’s own spokesmen said: ‘Ministerial travel is governed  by the Ministerial Code, which states that arrangements must be efficient and cost-effective. The Minister said he would rather cycle the quarter-mile distance between his desk at the Home Office and the House of Commons (pictured) ‘Providing bicycles would mean additional and unnecessary cost to the department when arrangements are already in place. For short journeys, and where practicable, Ministers can walk or use public transport.’ Mr Baker’s appointment was surprising because he once wrote a book claiming British spies covered up the death of Dr David Kelly, who exposed Tony Blair’s ‘dodgy dossier’ on Iraq. However, sources say relations between Mr Baker and Mrs May are ‘surprisingly cordial and pragmatic’.","Norman Baker has asked for bicycle instead of being chauffeur driven .

"By . Anna Edwards . Gray said his life had been 'ruined' by the incident . A detective sergeant raped a mother in . her own home after forcing her front door open when she turned him down . following a date, a court heard today. Trevor . Gray, 49, is accused of breaking the security chain before attacking . the 43-year-old woman in her bed while her children slept in a nearby . room. A court heard the pair . had been out for drinks in Nottingham city centre on a Saturday night . in July, 2011 before going back to her house in a taxi in the early . hours of the next day. Gray, . who was an off-duty officer with Nottinghamshire Police at the time, . left the home when the woman asked him to go and said he was going to . try and get a taxi up the road. The . court heard that Gray returned to the house when he couldn't hail a . taxi and forced his way in because he was worried something had happened . to her as she wasn't answering his calls. But . Birmingham Crown Court also heard he sent her a text message saying . 'you are harsh' before forcing his way back in just minutes later. A . jury of nine men and three women were told the next memory the victim . has was of Gray, who was off duty at the time, being naked on top of her . in her bed raping her. The woman told officers she remembered waking up the next day and challenging Gray about the broken door chain and how he had got into her house. Gray left after the woman called him a taxi and the next day she spoke to her friend, who was also a serving police officer, who reported the matter to her superiors. Gray, of Watnall, pictured at court with his ex-wife Alison, denies a charge of rape, attempted rape and another of sexual assault . When the father-of-two was arrested he . admitted he had sex with the victim but claimed he did it after she . asked him to, the court heard. Giving evidence today, Detective Sergeant Justine Wilson told the court that the woman told her she believed Gray had raped her. She said: 'They had arranged to go out on . Saturday July 23. They met in Nottingham city centre and had gone to . several bars together. Gray claims he returned to the house after failing to flag down a taxi and said he had forced the door because he was concerned something might have happened to her when she ignored his calls . 'She said initially she had been drinking wine and in the last bar she felt drunk so asked for a vodka and coke. Mr Gray returned from the bar and stated he had bought her a double. 'She recalls being in the taxi with Mr Gray and returning to her home address. Having gone inside she paid her babysitter. 'After the babysitter left she said she didn’t feel well and said she was going to bed. 'She doesn’t remember Mr Gray leaving the house at all but feels he must have from the texts and missed calls she had. 'The next thing she remembers is being in bed naked and she was woken by receiving text messages from Mr Gray. 'Then she said she was awoken by the noise of the door-bell being rang several times which she ignored. 'She remembers Mr Gray being in bed with her. She was on her front and Mr Gray was on top of her. She then remembers Mr Gray attempting or actually penetrating her. 'She didn’t know whether he had worn a condom or had ejaculated. She woke up (in the morning) Mr Gray was next to her. 'She went downstairs and attended to her children. Mr Gray came downstairs and she made him a cup of coffee. 'She then said she was busy and that he had to go so she called a taxi for him and at that point he left.' The court heard Gray claimed in police interviews he had returned to the house after failing to flag down a taxi and said he had forced the door with 'bodily pressure' because he was concerned something might have happened to her when she had ignored his calls. The jury heard Gray was found . guilty of the rape at an earlier trial at Derby Crown Court and spent . 13 months in prison, but had the conviction quashed by the Court of . Appeal. Trevor Gray’s . barrister Michael Wolkind said the conviction was quashed because it was . deemed 'unsafe' after a taxi driver who picked him up came forward as a . new witness. The Court of Appeal overturned his conviction in July last year after he was jailed for eight years and ordered a retrial. Giving . evidence Gray said his life had been 'ruined' by the incident and said . he had been dismissed by Nottinghamshire Police after the original . guilty verdict. Gray, of Watnall, Nottinghamshire, denies a charge of rape, attempted rape and another of sexual assault. He said: 'I did not (rape the victim). The sexual activities were consensual. She agreed to everything, she initiated everything. 'It was her suggestion to go back to her house. I was on a date, I had no expectations. 'She gave me a tour of the house, she was obviously very proud of the house, it was new. 'We went back to the lounge and we sat on the settee cuddling and kissing. She suddenly said it’s probably time to go, I went to the door, we kissed and I went.' Speaking about when he returned to the house after failing to flag down a taxi, Gray added: 'I rang her phone, I send her another text asking her to get me a cab, again there was no response. 'I rang a couple more times and got no response. At that point I felt there was clearly something wrong. I walked back down towards the house. 'I could see the lights were on. I could see the door was ajar. 'My levels of concern were getting higher and higher. I repeatedly rang the doorbell with no response. I shouted through the door with no response. 'Then I made a decision to enter the premises. I used my hands on the door and pushed it open snapping the chain. 'She was sitting up in bed. I explained to her that I had been concerned about her. I then asked her if she could get me a taxi. 'She said ‘you might as well stay now’. Everything was absolutely fine. 'I removed my clothing, used the toilet then I got in to the bed. I was lying in the bed, I turned away from her and after a few minutes I felt her arm come across me. I turned inwards and we started to kiss. 'The (police) investigation which put me in prison was a poor investigation. My life has been ruined. I’ve been put in prison for 13 months for something I didn’t do.' The trial continues.

"By . Daniel Miller . Martin Tankleff, pictured after his release from prison in 2007, has settled his wrongful conviction lawsuit for $3.4million . A man who served 17 years in prison after police tricked him into falsely confessing to murdering his parents has settled a wrongful conviction lawsuit against New York state for nearly $3.4million. Martin Tankleff, 42, was convicted in the 1988 killings of his parents in their eastern Long Island home. But he was freed in 2007 after an appeals court found key evidence in his trial was overlooked. Prosecutors ultimately decided against a new trial. His attorneys argued that his confession was coerced and that a family business associate was the real culprit. A spokeswoman for the state attorney general confirmed the settlement, saying it resolves the case on behalf of the state. Tankleff was 17 years old when his parents were bludgeoned and stabbed. He told police he found them on September 7, 1988, in their waterfront home in Belle Terre. His mother was dead; his father was gravely wounded and died a few weeks later. The teenager suggested that a partner in his father's bagel business could be the killer. He said the partner owed Seymour Tankleff hundreds of thousands of dollars. The business partner, Jerry Steuerman, was never charged and has denied involvement in the crimes. After questioning Tankleff at home and at police headquarters, detectives falsely told him that his father had awoken from a coma and named him as the killer. At that point, Tankleff wondered aloud whether he might have 'blacked out' and committed the crimes. Police said they read him his Miranda warning, but Tankleff waived his rights and confessed to attacking his parents. Original trial: Tankleff was 17 years old when his parents were . bludgeoned and stabbed to death at their Long Beach home. He was tricked . into confessing to their murder . Tricked: After questioning Tankleff at home and at . police headquarters, detectives falsely told him that his father had . awoken from a coma and named him as the killer . He said he was angry at his parents over a variety of slights, including being made to drive a 'crummy old Lincoln,' police said. However, Tankleff quickly withdrew the confession, refusing to sign a statement police had prepared. Tankleff was sentenced to 50 years to life in prison after being convicted in one of the nation's first televised trials. The case raised questions about police interrogation tactics and drew the support of the Innocence Project, an organization dedicated to exonerating wrongfully convicted people. A federal lawsuit against Suffolk County and a detective who has admitted he coerced a confession from Tankleff is pending.","Martin Tankleff was tricked into confessing to murdering his parents in 1988 .

"By . Anna Edwards . The father-of-two was collected from the scene and driven to the home of his teenage daughter . The son of  Edelweiss singer Vince Hill has been found dead just hours after crashing his car on black ice. Athol Hill, 42, was discovered at the home of his 15-year-old daughter and her mother. Paramedics were called but he could not be revived. Detectives were today awaiting the results of a post mortem examination to establish the exact cause of his death. Today his distraught 79-year-old father was trying to come to terms with his death as well as nursing his critically ill wife Annie, who has a serious lung complaint. Police confirmed that Athol Hill was involved in a crash in Henley-on-Thames, South Oxfordshire, on Sunday evening when his silver coloured Renault Scenic is thought to have skidded on black ice, crashed into several parked cars and slammed into a garden wall. A spokesman for Thames Valley Police said that the accident was being treated as 'damage only' and that Athol was not thought to have been injured. The father-of-two was collected from the scene and driven to the home of his teenage daughter and her mother, Liz Green in Henley-on-Thames. Thirty-six hours later Ms Green tried to rouse him but discovered he had died. The body was taken to the John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, where a pathologist will carry out the post mortem examination. His distraught 79-year-old father was trying to come to terms with the death as well as nursing his critically ill wife Annie . 'The death is not being treated as suspicious although inquiries are continuing on behalf of the Oxfordshire coroner and an inquest will be opened later,' said the spokesman. Mr Hill topped the bill at the London Palladium in the 1970s and hit the No 2 spot in the Top 10 with his hit song Edelweiss. Today Mr Hill was awaiting a coroner's report as to how Athol had died. He said: 'When I broke the news of Athol's death to my sister, she gasped, ""how much more can we take as a family?"" before bursting into tears'. Robert Holmes, the singer’s agent for the last 40 years, said, 'It is totally tragic for Vince and Annie. 'They’ve been so supportive of Athol over the years and now this happens. Sadly, you never know what life is going to throw at you. 'I’ve known Athol since he was born. He was the child they had waited so long for and never expected to have. 'When Athol arrived, Vince and Annie were the happiest couple in the world.' Athol was understood to have called in at Liz’s home to visit his teenage daughter after the crash, which was understood to have left him with blurred vision. He walked away from the scene but was worried about the Renault Scenic, which was a write-off.","Athol Hill, 42, was discovered at the home of his daughter and her mother .

"By . Lucy Crossley . This is all that is left of a £60,000 sports car abandoned by its owner when its engine stopped on a flooded road after it was ‘ripped to shreds’ by thieves. The 4.2 litre Audi RS5 - which has a top speed of 174mph and does 0-60mph in 4.5 seconds - was ditched on a road near a railway bridge approaching the M25 in Chertsey, Surrey, last month. In the past two weeks the grey car - which would have cost £59,350 when new - has been stripped to just a shell by vandals.

Gregg Watkins, who spotted the Audi . just two days after it was abandoned, said it was ‘incredible’ how fast . it had been stripped. He said: 'When I first drove past it, it looked perfect, but within a few days the bonnet, wing mirrors and lights had gone. 'Over . the course of the next two weeks the car was stripped to the bone and . is pretty now just a shell with nothing left worth taking.'

Photographs of the abandoned car have appeared on various websites, including AutoBant and Zero2Turbo, in the past two weeks showing the remains of the one powerful car. 'From a stunning car worth a couple of years’ wages it been ripped to shreds to nothing,' said one unnamed motorist who posted a version of the picture. 'The poor owner will hopefully get a new car on his insurance, but he’ll be wishing he never drove through that puddle.' Discarded: The car was abandoned close to this railway bridge . Remnants: The car is now virtually unrecognisable . Mystery: A spokesman for Surrey Police said it had no record of the car being stolen .

"By . Anna Edwards . A heroic 93-year-old World War Two RAF bomber was left house-bound after his mobility scooter was stolen by thieves who broke into his garage. Ron Brown, who flew 64 bombing missions over Nazi-occupied Europe, has now had a replacement bought for him by the Royal British Legion. The theft, at his home in Mansfield, Nottinghamshire, on November 18 last year, left him house-bound. Ron Brown had his mobility scooter stolen after thugs broke into his garage and took away his scooter . But yesterday his comrades in the Royal British Legion vowed to stump up £2,000 for a brand new one. Mr Brown said: 'I can only walk about 50 yards, so I am dependent on it when I leave the house. His comrades in the Royal British Legion vowed to stump up £2,000 for a brand new one . 'Since it was taken, I have not really been able to go out. 'I had a heart attack about 18 months ago and I had just about fully recovered when this happened. 'Taking my scooter away from me was such a heartless thing to do.' Mr Brown flew as a Bomber Command flight engineer and took part in 64 bombing operations with 218 Squadron and 75 New Zealand Squadron between 1939 and 1945. Mr Brown's survival is exceptional, considering that Bomber Command crews suffered an extremely high casualty rate during World War II. The brave crews endured a staggering 44.4 per cent death rate. A total of 55,573 were killed out of a total of 125,000 aircrew, with a further 8,403 wounded in action. He said: 'The legion has offered to buy me a new scooter, which I am very grateful for. 'I informed the police that the scooter was taken but, sadly, there has been no sign of recovering it. 'I am over the moon that the legion is making efforts to replace it for me. 'They are an absolute wonderful and caring organisation. 'The police have also been marvellous and have done all they can for me.' Three years ago, Mr Brown suffered a stroke, which affected his mobility. The scooter gave him independence and allowed him to do his own shopping. Mr Brown flew as a Bomber Command flight engineer and took part in 64 bombing operations with 218 Squadron and 75 New Zealand Squadron between 1939 and 1945 . A spokesman for the Royal British Legion said: 'The Royal British Legion offers support to any serving or ex-service personnel and their families today and for the rest of their lives. 'We would encourage anyone who meets this criteria and finds themselves in need of help to get in contact.' A spokesman for Nottinghamshire Police said: 'The offenders had prised the garage door open and took the mobility scooter, which was on charge. 'House-to-house inquires have taken place to gather information and inform neighbours. 'Mobility scooter shops have also been visited to see if the scooter was being offered for sale. 'Officers have also checked social media and websites for anyone that is trying to sell the scooter.'","Hero Ron Brown flew 64 bombing missions over Nazi-occupied Europe .

"By . Anna Edwards . and Lizzie Edmonds . A man has been captured on video drinking an entire bottle of white wine in four seconds as his friends cheered him on.

Finally, he neatly plonks it back on to a table - which . appears to be in a pub. After necking the 750ml bottle of alcohol, the man gives a thumbs up to the camera. The man's friends then gather around him - with one giving him a congratulatory pat on the back. The person who uploaded the video on to the YouTube captioned the video: 'Our friend Joe has always been good at downing drinks so on this Monday night we tested him with a bottle of house white. 'DO NOT TRY THIS AT HOME KIDS.' He drinks the contents of the entire bottle before neatly plonking it back on to a table believed to be in a pub . Experts today condemned the video, saying it was 'dangerous'. They warned the video may also be damaging for the man as it could be seen by future employers. Dr Sarah Jarvis, medical adviser to alcohol education charity Drinkaware, said: 'Young people often say they feel peer pressure to drink to fit in, but competitions to drink excessively in a short space of time can be dangerous and this should not come as a surprise. 'Quite apart from the risk of accident or injury as a result of drinking to excess, there is another aspect to these online drinking games which is the 'cybershame' some young people may experience. 'Drinkaware research shows nearly half of 18-24 year olds admitted un-tagging drunk photos of themselves that they didn’t want others to see. The government advises that people should not regularly drink more than the daily unit guidelines of 3-4 units of alcohol for men and 2-3 units of alcohol for women . 'However there is still a chance that these photos may be seen by universities and prospective employers. So while it may seem like a lot of fun at the time, the range of negative consequences are no laughing matter.' Binge drinking is defined by the NHS as drinking more than double the daily unit guidelines in one session. For men this is over eight units, and for women, over six, the charity Drink Aware says. However, the rate at which they reach intoxication varies because individuals are all different. The government advises that people should not regularly drink more than the daily unit guidelines of 3-4 units of alcohol for men (equivalent to a large (250ml) glass of 13 per cent wine) and 2-3 units of alcohol for women (equivalent to a 175ml glass of 13 per cent wine). ‘Regularly’ means drinking every day or most days of the week.","Man, known only as Joe, seen downing 750ml bottle while out with friends .

"By . Lizzie Edmonds . Britain will be battered with up to half a month's rainfall overnight on Sunday - with stormy conditions set to continue well in to 2014, forecasters say. Up to 40mm of rain will fall in western parts of the country tomorrow evening and will only start to clear around midday on Monday, predictions show. The average rainfall for the whole of December in the west is 80-100mm. Under water: A children's playground is submerged in flood water in Tewkesbury, Gloucestershire. Heavy rainfall across the country is predicted over the next couple of days . Submerged: Rainwater surrounds the Abbey in Gloucestershire. Up to 40mm of water is predicted to fall overnight on Sunday - half the average for the month of December . Expansive: Flooding across the fields in Apperley, Gloucestershire following the Christmas storms . Wild waves: A surfer braves the freezing seas in Perranporth, Cornwall this morning . Already flooded areas in the west country, Wales and the north west will bear the brunt of the appalling conditions, a forecaster from MeteoGroup said today. Around 30mm of rain is predicted across the rest of the country on Sunday night alone. Gusts of up to 55mph are also set to batter the country.

"By . Victoria Woollaston . Imagine a world where trains run continuously, picking up passengers without ever having to waste time stopping and starting at individual stations. That’s the vision behind a revolutionary concept created by Chinese designer Chen Jianjun. Rather than waiting on a platform and filing through the train’s series of narrow doors, passengers wait in a pod above the tracks. As the train passes through the station, the pod locks onto the roof of the train and the passengers descend down a staircase into the train below. Scroll down for video . Passengers wait in a pod on an elevated platform at each station. As the train passes through the station, this pod locks onto the front of the roof and passengers descend onto the train. The pod then moves to the rear of the roof to pick up passengers who want to exit at the next stop. When the train arrives at the next stop, the rear pod is detached and a new pod is collected. The cabin then moves to the back of the train where people who want to exit at the next stop ascend into the roof-top pod. As the train approaches the next station, the pod detaches and comes to a stop at the station, as the next pod is collected. The video is in Chinese, but according to a translated version, the designer explains that on a journey between Beijing and Guangzhou there can be up to 30 stops. If each stop takes approximately five minutes to drop off and pick up passengers, this adds an extra 2 hours and 30 minutes to the journey. Passengers can board the pod from either the front or the back using smaller platforms. The doors close and the pod is fitted with seats, and a hatch is built into the floor in the centre of cabin . As the train passes through the station, this elevated pod locks onto the front or centre of the roof. Passengers then descend onto the train through a staircase . The video also explains that the concept would save energy and fuel without having to stop and start each time. Since the concept video emerged, a number of other designers have also suggested that instead of a staircase, passengers could slide down a chute onto a cushion in order to save even more time. The concept does not explain how . disabled people, or people who are unable to use stairs, would use the . system, for example, and there are also no plans to make this concept a . reality yet.

"By . Anna Edwards . A father shot his daughter before taking his own life because he feared they could not cope with the death of her mother, an inquest has heard. Pauline Barker, 56, was found drowned in the River Trent near Colwick, Nottingham, on April 15 2012. An inquest into the three deaths, held in Nottingham, heard her former partner Archie McKelvie, 64, believed neither he nor their daughter Corrin Barker, 31, could cope with the loss. Concluding the hearing today, Nottinghamshire coroner Mairin Casey told the inquest: 'Archie formed the view that he could not cope or carry on alone. He worried that Corrin would not cope with the news of her mother’s death. Archie McKelvie, 64, believed neither he nor their daughter Corrin Barker, 31, could cope with the loss . 'I find that he then planned in a pre-meditated way. 'He concluded that the best option, perhaps the only option, for him and for Corrin, was that he should end matters for both of them. 'At some time between April 25 and April 26 2012, Archie shot Corrin at close range in the back. It is highly unlikely that Corrin was aware of this plan. 'Archie then self discharged the firearm and took his own life'. The two-day inquest, which started on Wednesday, heard Pauline Barker had suffered from mental health problems. Police could not initially identify her body when it was found in the river on April 15 2012 and issued an appeal for information. The investigation led them to Mr McKelvie’s home in West Bridgford, where they found him and Corrin, who had lived in the Edwalton area, dead in the kitchen from gunshot wounds on April 26. Pauline Barker, 56, was found drowned in the River Trent . A shotgun was recovered from the scene and a Home Office post-mortem examination revealed they had both died from gunshot wounds. Tests also revealed Pauline Barker had died from drowning. Nottinghamshire Police confirmed there was no third party involved in the deaths. Giving evidence to the inquest today, Detective Chief Inspector Kate Meynell said: 'It became clear early on in our investigation that there were no suspicious circumstances surrounding the deaths. 'It became apparent Archie had taken Corrin’s life and that no third party was involved.' When asked whether she thought the events could have been forseen, DCI Meynell said: 'No, I don’t think so'. The inquest heard that Pauline Barker, who lived in Lady Bay, was known to suffer from depression and that the family, although sociable, had kept their private lives to themselves. The coroner said: 'Pauline remained a private person throughout her life. If she was struggling she was not likely to share this with others'. She was treated by GPs and took medication but also developed her own way of coping with the depression by going away by herself to the coast, the hearing heard. The inquest heard Mr McKelvie became increasingly concerned when he had not heard from Ms Barker in mid April 2012. Ms Casey said he had a suspicion that she had taken her own life after he heard a body had been found in the Trent. The coroner said: 'He struggled to imagine life for Corrin and himself in her absence'. During the inquest, Mr McKelvie was described as a 'loveable rogue' who was well-known in the local area. He was a 'gregarious and kind man' who lived life 'on his own terms', the inquest heard. The hearing was told he had no history of depression or mental health issues. Ms Casey recorded that Ms Barker had committed suicide and, on hearing of her death, Mr McKelvie had unlawfully killed Corrin and subsequently taken his own life. Following her conclusion, the coroner told family members who were in court today: 'This I appreciate was extremely shocking news for you. 'News that would certainly have affected you deeply'. She said she hoped the hearing had given them answers as to why the 'terrible tragedy' had occurred. 'What is unpredictable is unpreventable and this could not have been prevented,' she told them. In a statement issued through Nottinghamshire Police following the conclusion of the inquest, relatives of the family said their lives had been turned 'upside down' by the deaths. They said: 'Our lives were turned upside down the moment we learned we had lost Pauline, Archie and Corrin. The last two years have been a distressing and confusing time, full of unanswered questions and much sorrow. 'We’d like to thank the police for keeping us up to date on the investigation as it progressed as well as their sensitive and unwavering support during this period. 'We now have some answers to the tragedy of what happened to our loved ones and ask that people respect our privacy so we can begin to move on from this ordeal.'","Pauline Barker, 56, was found drowned in the River Trent .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . and Associated  Press Reporter . Sentenced: Devon Jenkins, 16, has been sentenced to probation and community service after acting as a lookout while his friend's grandmother was killed last year . A 16-year-old boy who acted as a lookout while his friend's grandmother was ambushed, strangled and stabbed in her Minnesota home was today sentenced to probation and community service. Devon James Jenkins must complete a . youth correctional program, perform 100 hours of community service and . serve probation until age 21 over the murder of 79-year-old Lila Warwick. 'I go to bed every night thinking about the awful things I did,' Jenkins told Kandiyohi County Court about the July 2013 incident. Jenkins, who had smoked marijuana on the night of the murder, told the court he's been in chemical dependency treatment since October and wants to get his high school diploma, work with his dad in the drywall business and go to Ridgewater College to get his general classes, according to The Global Dispatch. As Jenkins apologized in court for his actions, Warwick's daughter Cheri Ekbom said she did not hate her mother's attackers. She did not comment on the sentence. 'Maybe it seemed like such an innocent thing to get in that car that night,' she said, according to Star Tribune. 'As a result of that choice, the life of a human being - my mother - was violently taken from us. It will also cost you five years of your life. 'To hate you would bring dishonor to my mom and only allow the darkness...to continue.' Jenkins was the youngest of three defendants charged over Warwick's tragic death. Prosecutors said the church volunteer's own grandson, 18-year-old Robert Warwick, masterminded the deadly plan that led 19-year-old Brok Junkermeier to choke and stab the woman. Junkermeier was charged with intentional second-degree murder, without premeditation, and his trial is in March. Warwick's trial has not been scheduled. Victim: Lila Warwick, 79, was found strangled and stabbed to death in her Minnesota home last year . Crime scene: Lila Warwick was found dead in the basement of her Willmar, Minnesota, home last year . According to the charging documents, Warwick believed that his grandmother had more than $40,000 in a safe. The trio had reportedly been planning to kill Warwick and steal her money for some time. Warwick's body was found after she . failed to show up at a meeting at Redeemer Lutheran Church, where she . was a volunteer. ‘Upon . entering into the garage and home, deputies found evidence of homicidal . violence and found the body of Ms. Warwick who was deceased,’ one of the . juvenile petitions said. Preliminary autopsy results showed she died from complex homicidal violence involving multiple stab wounds and strangulation. After the murder, witnesses told authorities they heard Junkermeier talk previously about killing Warwick and stealing her money, but both thought he was joking. One of the witnesses said that the day after the killing, Junkermeier came to him and talked about the burglary and attack. Charged: Prosecutors say Warwick's own grandson Robert Warwick, 18 (right) masterminded the attack while Brok Junkermeier, 19 (left) choked and stabbed the woman . According to the charges, Junkermeier told his friend that he and another teen drove to Warwick's house in the 3000 block of U.S. Highway 12 East at around 4am on July 29 and lay in ambush. The 19-year-old had previously obtained a key to get into Warwick's garage, and went inside wearing a mask and gloves while Jenkins stayed in the car as a lookout. Junkermeier waited two hours for Warwick to enter the garage, then ambushed her and slashed her hand with a 20-inch knife. The suspect told his friend that while the elderly woman was bleeding heavily, he forced her to access her bank account online and write him a check for $1,500. Prosecutors say Junkermeier later deposited that money into his account. Callous: Charges state that after the murder, Junkermeier and Jenkins (pictured) went to a McDonald's for a snack before heading home . Junkermeier told his confidant he then began to strangle Warwick, and when he saw she was not dead, he stabbed her multiple times before dumping her in the basement, the charges said. The charges state that soon after Warwick’s gristly murder, Junkermeier and Jenkins went to a nearby McDonald’s for a snack and then headed home, The Minneapolis Star Tribune reported. At around 2pm that day, Junkermeier and Robert Warwick returned to Lila Warwick's house and took a safe. The duo stopped by the house again at around 5pm and saw police officers on the scene. The charges said Junkermeier confessed to the killing when he was arrested and told police where to find the bloody knife. Pillar of community: Lila Warwick, right, pictured with her daughter, Cheri Ekbom, was a grandmother to eight children, great-grandmother to two others and volunteered at Redeemer Lutheran Church in Willmar . Bloody gym shoes, a safe and 30 $1,000 savings bonds in Warwick's name were found at Junkermeier's house, the complaint said. At the time of the incident, Cheri Ekbom said her nephew was a drug addict who hated his grandmother and wanted her dead. Junkermeier, a 2012 graduate of Willmar High School, has had some previous run-ins with the law involving theft-related charges and was on probation at the time of Warwick's death. Former classmates described Junkermeier to Echo Press as a big sports enthusiast who did not have many friends in school and was often picked on. Graham Dahl, 19, called Junkermeier a stone-faced 'weird kid' who had little respect for his teachers and would sometimes get ejected from class for acting out. Warwick had eight grandchildren and two great-grandchildren. She and her husband, who died in 1976, had lived in Willmar since 1969.","Three teenagers were charged over murder of Lila Warwick, 79, in her Minnesota home last year .

Nursery worker Sophee Redhead (left), 25, is standing trial for Lydia’s manslaughter by gross negligence . Prosecutor Robert Smith QC has claimed Redhead saw the little girl walk towards the slide - but left Lydia 'to her own devices' for up to 20 minutes. Giving evidence at court on Wednesday, Redhead’s voice broke as she recounted how she had to untangle Lydia from the rope and ran back into the nursery building with the lifeless child in her arms. She told how she realised something was terribly wrong when she saw Lydia, who was on her first day at the nursery, on the slide looking 'pale'.

"By . Simon Jones . Click here for all the latest news . Zenit St Petersburg are launching a bid to prise unsettled Thomas Vermaelen away from Arsenal. Arsene Wenger can ill afford to let anyone go just now with a mounting injury crisis but the 28-year-old Vermaelen is eager to play more games with a place in Belgium's World Cup squad at stake. His experience should be enough to ensure selection by Marc Wilmots but Vermaelen is also conscious of being sharp enough to perform at his best for his country in Brazil where Belgium are among the dark horses for a semi final place. On the move? Out-of-favour Arsenal defender Thomas Vermaelen (left) is a target for Russian club Zenit . He is settled in London but 11 games in all competitions this season is not enough. There are plenty of clubs who have been keen to take him, such as Napoli, but have so far failed with Wenger stressing his importance to the cause and Vermaelen wary of making the wrong move. Ambitious Zenit have Belgian internationals Nicolas Lombaerts and Axel Witsel already in their line-up, they have the cash too to make a deal attractive to all parties but the timing may not be right for Arsenal. Sliding in: Vermaelen, who is keen to cement his place in Belgium's World Cup squad, has struggled for playing time at Arsenal this season .

Moyes has watched the Frenchman . personally and is still looking around in the hope he or his scouts spot . something better to replace Rio Ferdiand and Nemanja Vidic.

Moyes . also had the opportunity to sign Porto midfielder Fernando, who again . is expected to move to City on a free in the summer, but declined. Pardew hoping wanted man Cisse stays put . Newcastle manager Alan Pardew will be hoping the club resists offers for Papiss Cisse on Monday. The Senegal striker is the subject of offers from Besiktas and Trabzonspor with the Turkish window due to close at 5pm. Time is against them but an £8million . offer will make life even more difficult for Pardew as he tries to lift . his club following Yohan Cabaye's sale and Saturday's derby defeat. Even . surviving today may not put an end to the interest as Russian clubs are . also keen on Cisse. They have until the end of this month before their . window closes. Opposite ways: Newcastle boss Alan Pardew (left) is hoping to keep hold of striker Papiss Cisse (right) Spurs eye wing wizards Thauvin and Konoplyanka . The windows of opportunity remain open in Eastern Europe and Scandinavia. Here's the closing times: .

Tottenham showed some late interest in Marseille's attacking midfielder Florian Thauvin last week. A return to France for Etienne Capoue was mooted as part of the deal but Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy is keen to see how Capoue develops hence his resistance to Napoli's efforts to sign him - plus the obvious factor that he did not want to sell for a loss so soon after purchasing. Ongoing Chelsea and Newcastle target Thauvin has not been too consistent of late and his performance against Monaco recently drew criticism from Frank Lebouef as reported by Sportsmail. Tottenham are considering various . summer targets and plan to resume talks over Ukraine winger Yevhen . Konoplyanka later this month. Dnipro pulled the plug on his proposed . £15m move to Liverpool and Tottenham hope to capitalise. Talking . of Liverpool's efforts to sign Konoplyanka, Dnipro chief executive . Andriy Rusol said: 'The president could not keep the midfielder because . his contract spelled out the specific amount of compensation. Big future: Marseille winger Florain Thauvin has attracted interest from Tottenham, Chelsea and Newcastle . 'In fact, the British did not have time to complete the transaction. Our club could not sign the documents until our account received the money. And they did not receive anything before the deadline. 'Yevhen is a very strong person he knows his move to a big club is only a matter of time.' Blades youngster De Girolamo under the microscope . Chelsea,Tottenham and Arsenal will have scouts posted at tomorrow night's FA Cup replay between Fulham and Sheffield United. They are hoping to see if Diego de Girolamo gets on from the bench for Sheffield United. The 18-year-old is continuing to build up game time following ten months out with ligament damage and hopes to get a chance to test himself against Premier League defenders and play a part in a potential cup shock for Nigel Clough's men. Talent: Chelsea, Tottenham and Arsenal are hoping to see Sheffield United youngster Diego De Girolamo in action against Fulham . Birmingham youngster Brown attracts City and Liverpool . Manchester City and Liverpool are continuing to keep abreast of developments with Birmingham starlet Reece Brown. The 17-year-old signed professional forms at St Andrews last month and is progressing nicely having broken into the first team this season. Liverpool and City are not alone in the big clubs to have taken an interest but their financial clout may persuade cash-strapped Birmingham to sell should they follow up with an offer. City have a good rapport with Birmingham having loaned some of their fringe squad players to St Andrews. Battle: Manchester City and Liverpool are both keen on 17-year-old Birmingham City starlet Reece Brown . Championship duo consider Wednesday striker Lavery . Watford and Reading were among the clubs represented at Hillsborough on Saturday for Sheffield Wednesday's 1-0 win over Barnsley. Although Chris Maguire scored the winning goal, they went along to see Wednesday striker Caolan Lavery come on for the last 20 minutes. The 21-year-old Northern Ireland international has been on loan at Plymouth where he grabbed three goals in four starts and came back to score twice in Wednesday's 6-0 demolition of Leeds. Celtic have also shown an interest in Canadian-born Lavery and they will be heartened as his current contract runs out in the summer. Pitroipa explains failed Stoke move . Rennes winger Jonathan Pitroipa has blamed the collapse of his deadline-day loan move to Stoke City on middle men who got involved on behalf of the French club. The Burkina Faso international was at the Britannia Stadium on Friday only to see the deal beaten by the clock. He told L'Equipe: 'Contrary to what has been said, it was not due to my agent that I didn't join Stoke, but due to intermediaries appointed by Rennes on that case.' Staying put: Jonathan Pitroipa saw a deadline day move to Mark Hughes' Stoke fall through . Cellino eyes Serie A talent for Leeds . Leeds' prospective owner Massimo Cellino was busy putting out feelers for potential signings at the end of last week. Cellino is eager to bring in four new players if he gets the all-clear to buy the Elland Road club. Cagliari's Brazilian left-back Danilo Avelar, 24, plus playmaker Andrea Tabanelli, 24, who is on loan at Cagliari from Cesena, striker Daniele Cacia, 30, at Verona and 6ft 5ins striker Ferdinando Sforzini, 29, at Pescara were among names on list of potential recruits. Foxes consider Schmeichel replacement . Leicester City watched Marco Bizot at the weekend. The 6ft 5ins former Holland U21 goalkeeper was unable to prevent Groningen going down 2-0 away to Alkmaar but continues to improve a growing reputation. Holland are considering taking him to the World Cup and Leicester, who were joined by scouts from Bayer Leverkusen, Hertha Berlin and Borussia Monchengladbach, have an eye on taking him before his price gets too high. Safe hands: Leicester are keen on a deal for Holland U21 keeper Marco Bizot . They will offer Kasper Schmeichel a new contract but are aware of interest from AC Milan which may prove difficult to resist for the Dane and need a replacement.Neill on verge of Rovers deal . Lucas Neill may get his wish of a return to Blackburn Rovers this week. The 35-year-old Australian has been training at the Championship club and hopes the departure of Scott Dann to Crystal Palace on deadline day will help clear the club to give him a short term deal. Neill has had nine clubs in a varied career and spent six years at Blackburn previously between 2001 and 2007.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . and Associated Press . A second grand jury has indicted a North Carolina police officer who killed an unarmed former Florida A&M football player by shooting him ten times last year. Charlotte officer Randall Kerrick, 28, was indicted for voluntary manslaughter Monday in the shooting of 24-year-old Jonathan Ferrell last year. A separate jury declined to indict Kerrick last week. Investigators say Kerrick shot Ferrell on September 14 as he looked for help after a car crash. The voluntary manslaughter charge carries a prison sentence of up to 11 years. Georgia Ferrell, the victim's mother, told CNN that she is willing to be patient as the case travels through the justice system. 'I just feel like God's will will be done,' she said. Controversy: Unarmed Jonathan Ferrell (left) was killed in Charlotte last year after being shot ten times by police officer Randall Kerrick. On Monday a grand jury indicted Kerrick for voluntary manslaughter . Charles Monnett, an attorney for the . Ferrell family, said: 'With the strength of the evidence in this case, . we're not surprised. 'We're . all pleased and happy that the process is beginning now and that . there's an end in sight. It is the first step towards justice,' Monnett continued. The panel handed down the decision hours after a judge ruled the Attorney General's office could resubmit the case after the first grand jury declined to indict Kerrick. Because . the panel was four members short, Attorney General Roy Cooper decided . to make a request to send the case to a second jury. Kerrick's attorneys said that there was 'nothing irregular or improper' about the first grand jury. Ferrell’s . family claim that he was in a submissive position – either on his knees . or lying on the ground – when he was shot, and filed a wrongful death . suit against Kerrick two weeks ago. An . attorney for the family said the were 'disappointed, shocked, . devastated' by the first decision not to indict Kerrick, as reported by WBTV. Fatal: Ferrell apparently walked about a half-mile to the nearest house at the upscale Bradfield Farm community and was 'banging on the door viciously' to attract attention. Ferrell had survived a car accident and banged on the door of a nearby house in the middle of the night looking for help. Last Tuesday the grand jury decided not to indict Officer Kerrick on the charge and asked the prosecutor to submit a lesser charge. But . the state Attorney General's office issued a statement later in the day . saying it would resubmit the case to a full grand jury after learning . that the panel that heard the case was less than a full panel. NBC News . reported that the Mecklenburg County grand jurors submitted a . handwritten note saying that there wasn't enough evidence to indict . Kerrick on the original charge. Kerrick's attorney, George Laughrun, said the officer felt like 'the weight of the world has been lifted from his shoulders.' 'He's extremely relieved that the . grand jury members saw fit to keep an open mind and not listen to all . the propaganda on all the things he did wrong,' Laughrun continued, as . reported by the Charlotte Observer. Chris . Chestnut, the family's attorney, told the newspaper that the first . grand jury's decision was 'highly suspicious and gravely concerning.' The attorney said that the Ferrell family have been left out of the process throughout the investigation. Wrongful death: Ferrell's family filed a lawsuit two weeks ago. Attorney Charles Monnett (left) speaks, his as mother Georgia Ferrell (center), brother Willie Ferrell (standing) and attorney Chris Chestnut (right) look on during a news conference on January 14 . Sadness: A memorial sits at the site of Jonathan Ferrell's death in Charlotte . 'There has been nothing to demonstrate that this case has gotten the attention it deserves and needs for the citizens of Charlotte and America,' Chestnut said. 'It's that important a case. This feels like they don't value Jonathan's life.' Charlotte NAACP President Kojo Natambu told WBTV: 'This is one of the most despicable decisions I have ever seen made by human beings.' The wrongful death lawsuit filed by the Ferrell family also alleged that despite him . lying mortally wounded on the ground officers still deemed it necessary . to handcuff him, according to NBC News. The deadly encounter unfolded in Charlotte at about 2.30 a.m. on Saturday September 14 after Mr Ferrell had apparently been in an automobile wreck. A crash so severe he would have had to climb out of the back window to escape. Ferrell apparently walked about a . half-mile to the nearest house at the upscale Bradfield Farm community . and was 'banging on the door viciously' to attract attention. Thinking . it was her husband coming home late from work, the woman who lived . there opened the door. When she saw Ferrell, she shut it and called . police. The authorities subsequently released a tape of her 911 call. A . sobbing woman can be heard pleading for police to ‘please hurry’ after . telling a dispatcher that a man was breaking into her front door. Football star: Jonathan Ferrell (center) is pictured alongside teammates of his Florida A&M University 'Rattlers' football team . ‘He’s still there yelling,’ the woman said as the 911 dispatcher told her officers were on their way. ‘He’s yelling. He’s yelling.’ The unidentified woman keeps repeating ‘Oh, my god! Oh, my god!’ throughout the call. She also told the 911 operator that she had a baby in a crib and didn't know what to do. ‘He’s in his bed. I don’t know what to do. I can’t believe I opened the door,’ she said. Later, she said the man was knocking on her door and ‘he's in my front yard yelling.’ When three officers arrived they claim that Ferrell ran towards them. One officer attempted to Taser Ferrell but that didn't work and investigators said Ferrell continued to run towards Officer Randall Kerrick who had his service weapon drawn. Officer Kerrick fired 12 shots at Ferrell, striking Ferrell ten times. CMPD said officers on the scene thought Ferrell was a threat, but Kerrick was the only one who drew his gun and fired. Ferrell's family said the former . Florida A&M University football player moved to Charlotte about a . year ago to be with his fiancee and was working two jobs. He wanted to go back to school and eventually become an automotive engineer. Ferrell's mother said Kerrick had no business being a police officer if he couldn't react properly to a man who needed help. Tragic: Georgia Ferrell, mother of Jonathan Ferrell, holds a stuffed Winnie-the-Pooh bear as she arrives at a news conference in Charlotte on January 14 . 'I truly forgive him. I pray for him. And I pray that he gets off the police force,' Georgia Ferrell said. His family painted a picture of a bright man with an 'infectious smile' who was always there for his brothers and sisters. 'He was a role model,' said his brother, Frank. 'He had so much love in his heart. And he was always concerned about his family.' 'He had dreams of being an automotive engineer. He wanted to design a car from the very last bolt to the interior,' his brother said. He said he didn't know where his brother was going that night, or why he got into the accident. But he said his brother had never been in trouble before.","Second North Carolina grand jury indicts police officer Randall Kerrick, 28, who fatally shot unarmed Jonathan Ferrell, 24, ten times last September .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A football striker 'panicked' after receiving topless selfie pictures of his club's middle-aged administrator because she was as old as his mother, a tribunal heard. The 23-year-old striker for Burton Albion exchanged saucy snaps with Kerry Miller, 46, who is accusing the League Two team of driving her out of her job. Billie Kee told an employment tribunal how he sent naked pictures of himself to the blonde after receiving an image of her wearing underwear and another completely topless. Kerry Miller (left) and Burton Albion star Billy Kee (right) outside Leicester Employment Tribunal . Yesterday Burton manager Gary Rowett, . 39, said he was forced to speak to Mr Kee about the matter following . complaints she had barged into the dressing rooms while players were . getting changed. Giving evidence on the fourth day of the tribunal in Leicester, he said: 'I asked Billy if he had received a text from Kerry. 'He said he had received a picture of her in her underwear and another of her topless. 'He actually said he panicked and said ""she’s’the same age as my mum"".' Kerry Miller photographed outside Leicester Tribunal Court on the fourth day of an employment tribunal . The . tribunal heard how Ms Miller entered the players’ area on 15 occasions . and also confessed to have a 'casual' relationship with defender Ryan . Austin, 29, who has since left the club. Mr Rowett - who played in . the Premier League for Everton and Leicester City - told the hearing he . always believed there was a 'sexual connotation' to her actions. He . said he was forced to go to chairman Ben Robinson after a senior player . complained that her constantly being in the dressing room was making him . feel uncomfortable. The former defender added: 'I received a complaint from Zander Diamond. He came to my office and asked to speak to me. 'He . actually said he didn’t feel comfortable and didn’t feel it was right . and it hadn’t happened at any club he had been at in the past. 'I was aware of Kerry being in and around the dressing room area. I was aware of her up serving food. 'I . then made the chairman aware of it and then went and told Fleur . (Robinson) exactly what the complaint was and what my thoughts were on . the situation. 'I just had the general feeling that she wanted to be . around the players more than was necessary for someone who wasn’t a . member of the playing staff. 'I thought there was very much a sexual . connotation to her actions because for me there would be no other reason . for her to be in the situation she was in. Keeper: Ms Miller was rumoured to have been seeing Tomlinson between September and Christmas 2012 . The hearing heard of allegations of rumours that Ms Miller (left) had been seeing 28-year-old goalkeeper Stuart Tomlinson (right) between September and Christmas 2012 . 'One time she came down . to our office after a game, knocked on the door and sat in the middle of . the office for five minutes without particularly being invited.'To be honest I felt uncomfortable. 'Maybe it was me being a married man.' The . manager, who took over at the club in 2009, also said he had never come . across a similar issue with a female member of staff throughout his . entire football career. Leaving date: Ms Miller has confessed to having a 'casual' relationship with former defender Ryan Austin, who has since left the League Two club . He added: 'I’ve never come across a situation where a woman has been around where the players are. 'It was like a beacon going ‘this is not normal. 'In 24 years of being a footballer, coach and manager - I’ve never seen a woman in the dressing room. 'As a male I would never walk into a female dressing room.' Ms . Miller quit her sales role at the club’s Pirelli Stadium in . Burton-upon-Trent, Staffs, in February last year after a row with the . chairman. On the third day of her employment tribunal today, the . hearing heard of allegations of rumours she had been seeing 28-year-old . goalkeeper Stuart Tomlinson between September and Christmas 2012. The . following year Tomlinson turned his back on football after suffering a . bad knee injury to pursue a career in WWE wrestling in America. Scantily clad: Ms Miller, pictured in a bikini, has appeared at a tribunal claiming constructive dismissal . Giving evidence the club’s chairman Ben Robinson said Mr Tomlinson was a part-time male escort while he played for the team. Burton . Albion’s club secretary and commercial director Fleur Robinson said she . had spoken to Ms Miller after she posted an image of the pair together . in a Chester night-club. Giving evidence Ms Robinson, who is also . the chairman’s daughter, admitted she had 'raised an eyebrow' when the . picture emerged on October 27, 2012 - just hours after a crucial game. Evidence: The club's chairman Ben Robinson (pictured) said Tomlinson was a part-time male escort while he played for the team . Veteran . defender Aaron Webster, 32, told the hearing Ms Miller would be . constantly around the players on a daily basis and at one time was 'all . over' the club chairman. Giving evidence, Mr Webster - who made . 589 appearances and scored 101 goals for the club in 16 years before he . left last summer - said: 'Kerry likes male attention. In my opinion she . would flirt very directly with male staff and players on a regular and . daily basis. 'She came around the dressing room and the physio room in the morning. During lunchtime she would be around the players. The . tribunal today heard how Ms Miller was a 'desperate' flirt who thrived . on male attention and was viewed as a threat by Burton Albion's WAGs . 'At one period we did see her quite frequently. I'm not 100 per cent sure why she would be there. 'Some of the girlfriends saw Kerry as a bit of a threat. She was all over the chairman on one occasion. 'If . I'm honest I felt it was a little bit desperate from her at times. According to me I think she liked the male attention so if there was any . whistles or noises from the players she would like it. 'That's . why I personally think we saw her on a daily basis. I thought she . thrived on that. I've seen pictures on two players phones - Ryan Austin . and Billy Kee. 'I heard she had a thing for him [Stuart Tomlinson] but I never heard a rumour they had slept together.' The widow, from Marchington, Staffs, is claiming constructive dismissal, sexual discrimination and harassment against the club. Burton Albion deny all the allegations. The employment tribunal panel has now retired to consider their verdict and are expected to announce their decision tomorrow. In . a closing statement Sarah George, representing Burton Albion FC, said . Ms Miller had 'overreacted' to being reprimanded for her behaviour. She said: 'This is a professional football club. 'The . two occasions that she was spoken to were when a justifiable complaint . had been made about her coming in to the dressing room regularly when . the players were in a state of undress. Going for a Burton: Albion players celebrating after beating Middlesbrough 2-1 in January 2011 . 'The actions taken by the club were simply to tell the claimant to go about her business. 'The . reason for doing so was not because of assumptions made about the . claimant because she was a woman but based upon what she had done and . the desire to ensure that employees were working in the area they should . be working in. 'Her employment was not under threat, there’s no suggestion that was the case. 'The complainant has overreacted.' Threat: The tribunal heard Ms Miller was a 'desperate' flirt who thrived on male attention and was viewed as a threat by Burton Albion's WAGs . Representing . Ms Miller, James Bruce said his client was left with no faith in the . organisation and felt excluded by chairman Ben Robinson. He said: 'Mr Robinson handed out at least two reprimands to the claimant. 'The force of that reprimand is a matter of dispute but I suggest it was said in anger. 'He certainly was annoyed, Mr Robinson admits that himself, and I suggest that anger would have shown itself. 'The latter of those reprimands included the warning to stay away from the players. 'And that I suggest is a restriction of Ms Miller’s movement in her own workplace. 'The initial comment itself was the order not to cook for the players. 'The club prides itself on being a closely-knit family business. 'Members of the staff are expected to muck in, to help out. 'I . suggest for a member of staff to not be able to do that would be . detrimental because it leads to a sense of exclusion within one’s own . team. 'Ms Miller had in the past complained to Mr Robinson about how he spoke to her and how he treated her. 'Ms . Miller is left with no faith her concerns are being listened to when . she is subjected to that treatment off the cuff by the man in charge of . that organisation.'

'A sample from Phobos, which is much easier to reach than the Red Planet itself, would almost surely contain Martian material blasted off from large asteroid impacts,' said Jay Melosh of Purdue University. 'If life on Mars exists or existed within the last 10 million years, a mission to Phobos could yield our first evidence of life beyond Earth,' says Melosh.

There's also been a great deal of discussion about the possible spread of life in the universe from star to star.’ One of the least reflective bodies in . the solar system, Phobos also orbits Mars below the synchronous orbit . radius.

"By . Meghan Keneally . A player on the University of Massachusetts-Amherst basketball team has become the first openly gay college player. Derrick Gordon, a sophomore guard on the UMass team, made the announcement on ESPN this morning and said that he was happy to be open about his sexuality. 'I've always loved sports but always felt I had to hide and be someone that I’m not. For my whole life I’ve been living my life as a lie,' he told ESPN. Making history: Derrick Gordon is the first openly gay man in the NCAA's Division I who came out before his college career was over . Starter: Gordon transferred from Western Kentucky University to the University of Massachusetts after his freshman year and played as a starter for the Amherst 'Minutemen' throughout the 2013-2014 season . Happy: His teammates said that he looked as if a weight had been lifted off his shoulders when he told them . 'I am telling my story so that . athletes never feel like they have to hide. You can be true to yourself . and play the sport that you love.' 'I haven't felt like this. Ever. 'It's a lot of weight lifted off my shoulders. I can finally breathe now and live life happily.' After . the ESPN interview was published, Gordon posted a photo of himself . smiling and wearing a Nike shirt with a rainbow-colored hashtag on his . chest that said '#BETRUE'. 'This . is the happiest I have ever been in my 22 Years of living...No more . HIDING!!!...Just want to live life happy and play the sport that I . love...Really would love to thank my family, friends, coaches, and . teammates for supporting me,' he wrote in the lengthy caption. Happy: Gordon posted a photo of himself smiling on Instagram shortly after the news broke, saying that he was thankful for the support of his family, friends and mentors . Accepting: His announcement was reportedly met with nothing but positive comments by his teammates when he told them last week (pictured together in July) Public: Gordon, 22, said that he accepted his sexuality during his freshman year of college and mentioned that he had a boyfriend last summer but that does not appear to be ongoing . 'Ready . to get back in the gym with my teammates and get on the GRIND and get . ready for next season!!!! #BETRUE #BEYOURSELF #HONEYBADGER' University of Missouri football player . Michael Sam came out in February and NBA player Jason Collins made his . homosexuality public last May. Gordon . still makes history, however, because he will be the first one to come . out in the NCAA's division I and he chose to do so while he still has . two college seasons ahead of him. Though Sam came out to his teammates and . coaches before his college career ended, he did not make the public . announcement until after their season had finished but before the NFL . draft process started. He said that he closely watched how . Collins and Sam handled their respective announcements, but also gained . support from others behind the scenes- even before he came out to his . family. He came out to . his parents and coach, Derek Kellogg, in the end of March and came out . to his teammates a few days later on April 2 during an impromptu . meeting. 'It ended up being kind of a short meeting...The guys were like, ""We're behind you 100 percent. We cool?""' Coach Kellogg said. Support: Michael Sam, a top college football player who came out in February, Tweeted his support for Gordon shortly after the revealing interview was published . Leading the way: Sam (left) came out in February after his college career had ended and Jason Collins (right, seen in February) came out last May making him the first openly gay professional basketball player in America . His announcement wasn't only met with a positive reception in the locker room but also by a bastion of new supporters. GLAAD president Sarah Kate Ellis said that it showed how 'the tidal wave of support for gay and lesbian athletes continues to surge forward'. 'Derrick's bold decision to come out as gay isn't just significant, it's inspirational. Today, countless young basketball players, athletes, and men of color have another outstanding role model who reflects the fact that you can be who you want to be no matter who you love,' Ms Ellis said in a statement. Michael Sam chimed in over Twitter, telling his more than 95,000 followers and Gordon that he has 'so many in your corner and we're all proud and rooting for you'.","Derrick Gordon, 22, is a guard on the University of Massachusetts-Amherst basketball team and announced Wednesday that he is gay .

"By . Ashley Collman . and Daily Mail Reporter . A teenager who had an affair with his teacher has told how he was driven to the brink of suicide by feelings of guilt after she was jailed for the relationship. Jimmy Pallais, now 17, had a series of trsysts with married former Houston English teacher Kathryn Murray, 31, before the pair were eventually caught in bed at the family home. She was jailed for a year this week, after a court heard how their relationship began when when Murray was assigned to help Spanish-speaking Pallais after he was adopted from Costa Rica and brought to America by his parents at age 14. Thoughts of suicide: Jimmy Pallais, now 17, said he thought of killing himself to make the fallout with his affair with married Kathryn Murray, 31, 'go away' The pair were separated after Jimmy confessed to having a crush on her, but a relationship began after he kissed her in school. The pair had sex in Murray's classroom at Memorial Middle School several times, booked into a hotel and were finally caught in the family home by Jimmy's 12-year-old brother. As Murray faced jail, Jimmy told ABC's 20/20: 'that maybe if I [would] kill myself they [would forget] about this.' The show also revealed new details of the events leading up to the pair's affair. As Jimmy's feelings for Murray grew, he wrote her a letter confessing his love before tearing it up and giving it to Murray to throw away. But she ended up reading it anyway and told him: 'I read you're letter. I really like you, like, for real.' Jimmy's parents suspicions grew as he told them how 'pretty' Murray was at home and the pair were separated. Jailed: Kathryn Murray smiles as she s jailed for a year last week for her relationship with Jimmy Pallais when he was 15 . But the pair continued to chat online and the affair started when Jimmy walked up to Murray in her classroom and kissed her, before walking to his first class. When he saw her again, Murray said she could kiss him again - and the affair developed with a series of sexual liasions in her classroom and a hotel. They were discovered when Jimmy's little brother found them in bed together and Jimmy's parents found a text from Murray reading: 'You know I love you... I don't know what we're going to do, but we're going to be happy together... I'm worried about how obvious we are at school. I'm miss you.' His parents said: 'She robbed him of his childhood.I think it took his innocence away, because...that was his first time having sex.' The inappropriate relationship began in February 2012 when Murray, who is still married, was tutoring the Spanish-speaking eighth grader and the two went on to have 'repeated' sexual encounters, according to KHOU. Inappropriate relationship: Former Houston English teacher Kathryn Camille Murray, 31, was sentenced to one year in jail and one year in prison on Tuesday for sleeping with a student multiple times . On one occasion, Murray picked up the teen from a school dance after his dad dropped him off and took him to a hotel where they had sex for two hours. The couple were caught the following night by the teen's younger brother who found them in bed at the family home while their parents were away. Murray was fired that month following the allegations but remained free on $50,000 bail. Police discovered that the two had sex in a classroom at least twice and that prior to her arrest, Murray had closed her bank account and planned to skip the border to Mexico. At school: In the course of their investigation, police discovered that Murray had sex with the 15-year-old student she was tutoring at least two times in a classroom at Memorial Middle School . Despite being barred from seeing the teen by a judge, the affair continued. In January 2013, Murray was arrested again when she was found with the teen at her father's home. When police showed up at the house, the teen, then 16, tried to escape through the back door. She was charged with harboring a runaway and this time her bond was revoked. Sentencing in the case happened on Tuesday. Won't stop: Murray's affair with the boy continued even after she was arrested. Police found the then 16-year-old with Murray at her father's house and she was charged with harboring a minor . Murray attended Memorial Middle and High School and had been working in the Spring Branch ISD for the previous three years as a language arts teacher. Records say she is still married to her husband and they live at the same address in Houston. To this day, the teen she had relations with insists that they are in love but his mother calls him a victim. 'We are not good, we are very hurt. My son is really confused, hurt. We working with him very closely but he’s not good, not good at all,' the mother said.","Kathryn Camille Murray, 31, began an affair with a Spanish-speaking student, 17, she was tutoring in February 2012 .

"By . Alexandra Klausner . Terry Davenport, 63, had fit of road rage after allegedly seeing his 21-year-old lover with a younger man . A 63-year-old man from Luther, Michigan was arrested after he allegedly used his car to force another 31-year-old driver off the road and drag a woman down the street 'after seeing the woman with the younger man.' Terry Davenport, 63 was arraigned on Tuesday April 8 on two counts of assault with a dangerous weapon, failure to stop after collision and reckless driving and driving with a suspended license. The Cadillac Police Department say that Davenport became upset when he saw a 21-year-old woman with another man at her mother's house. Davenport allegedly tried to physically remove a 31-year-old man from his ford explorer in which the 21-year-old was was in the passenger's seat. The woman then allegedly got into 63-year-old Davenport's Oldsmobile Alero 'in order to calm him down.' The 21-year-old's plan backfired and when she tried to escape the Alero, Davenport dragged her ' a short distance' with the moving vehicle. M Live reports that the woman managed to escape and run back into the ford explorer but Davenport tailed the vehicle and repeatedly hit the car with his own car as the vehicles were speeding down the road. The chase, which lasted for about 2 miles, stopped when the younger man went through a stop sign and rolled into a ditch. The 31-year-old attempted to pull his car into the Wexford County sheriff's office but couldn't turn because he was going too fast. Davenport eventually left the scene and reported to the Sheriff's office. No one was injured except for the 21-year-old woman who suffered minor wounds after being dragged by Davenport's car as she attempted to escape. This is the car belonging to the 31-year-old after it was smashed by Davenport in a fit of road rage .","Terry Davenport, 63 was arraigned on Tuesday for charges related to his fit of road rage after seeing his '21-year-old love interest with another man'

"By . Anna Edwards . DJ Dave Lee Travis, 68, is charged with the indecent assault of 11 girls and women between 1976 and 2008 . Dave Lee Travis today admitted being quizzed by bosses over allegations he had touched a female colleague’s legs despite telling police he could not remember the incident. But he denied tailoring his evidence to fit the facts telling jurors he is 'not exactly Sherlock Holmes'. The DJ was being quizzed over claims he rubbed the legs of a woman at Chiltern Radio station and thrust his hand up her skirt. Southwark Crown Court heard in his police interview Travis originally said he could not remember any sex complaint being made against him at the station, where he had a show on Classic Gold FM. But as he was being questioned in the witness stand for the fourth day, Travis admitted he remembered being led into his boss’ office and told a female colleague had complained he touched her leg. The former Top of the Pops presenter admitted he could have brushed against the woman’s leg during a heated argument. But he branded claims he molested the woman were '100 per cent fabricated'. He said: 'I’m clever enough to be a DJ and do my own stuff on the radio and television. 'But I’m not exactly Sherlock Holmes, and can’t work out the best way of telling a story. My best way of telling anything is telling you the truth. 'I’m telling you the truth now. I can only tell you the truth. I’m remembering it.' He added: 'I haven’t been sat here listening to witnesses and saying that’s what I’ll say there. 'I’m trying to give you my account, my true account of what I recall.' Travis, 68, admitted he was a very tactile person and would often hug women, kiss them on the cheek and given them a shoulder massage to say hello . Ms Moore QC, prosecuting, put it to Travis that 'You are tailoring what you are saying because what you are saying in interview simply doesn’t stand up.' But Travis insisted he was not changing his story to fit other witnesses accounts that back up the allegations. He said: 'I’m not tailoring anything, I’m simply telling you the truth as I know it. 'I’m not changing anything, I’m not exaggerating anything, I’m simply telling you what I remember.' Travis, 68, admitted he was a very tactile person and would often hug women, kiss them on the cheek and given them a shoulder massage to say hello. But he furiously denied rubbing a female colleague’s breasts as he gave her a bear hug when they were introduced. Travis said he was left 'shaky' when police quizzed him over the allegations because he had never been arrested before . And he branded claims he groped two women at the station, who were both in their 20’s, 'completely false'. The court had earlier heard that a woman 'went ballistic' and branded him a pervert when he allegedly stuck his hand up her skirt. But Travis angrily denied the claims saying 'Completely 100 per cent fabricated. 'I didn’t do something to her. I was standing with her having an argument, I may have touched her legs with my leg or knees but it is not something I did to her. 'It is something that happened because I’m in close proximity.' And he rubbished claims that women at the station would lower their gaze when he walked into a room to avoid his unwanted attentions. He said: 'Nobody ever put their heads down when I walked in the newsroom. Ever.' Travis said he was left 'shaky' when police quizzed him over the allegations because he had never been arrested before. And he said this might explain the discrepancy in his account. He said: 'Everytime I’ve been with the police it has been a time of stress and strain. 'I’ve never been arrested in my life so I consider I was feeling a little bit shaky about that.' He is accused of four counts of indecent assault against two women at the station between 2000 and 2003. The court broke for half an hour to allow Travis, who has back problems, time to rest. Travis denies 13 indecent assaults and one sexual assault involving 11 woman and spanning 30 years. The case continues.

"By . Jessica Jerreat . One of the last surviving Native Americans who used their tribal languages to outwit the enemy during the Second World War has died in Oklahoma, aged 96. Edmond Harjo, a member of the Seminole Nation who was awarded the Congressional Gold Medal for his wartime service in November, suffered a heart attack on March 31. Harjo had been part of a group known as Windtalkers, who used their native language as code, when he served in Normandy, France. Hero: Edmond Harjo, a code talker and war veteran, has died aged 96 . At the ceremony in Washington DC last year, to recognize the efforts of 33 tribes, House Speaker John Boehner recalled how a chance encounter in France led to Harjo's amazing war service. The U.S. Marines used codetalkers in every Pacific assault from 1942 to 1945. The Native Americans used a code based on their language, which was never cracked by the Japanese. It was estimated that outside of tribes, fewer than 30 people understood the Najavo lanaguage during the Second World War. Native American language had also been used for code purposes in the First World War. The code was made up of unrelated Najavo words that would be translated into English. The first letter of the translated word would then be used to build up the message. When the Marines developed the code they had to create new words in the language to incorporate military terms, including 'besh-lo' meaning iron fish for submarine, and 'dah-he-tih-hi', which translates as humming bird, for fighter planes. The Windtalkers, as the Native American Marines became known, were essential to the war effort, with Major Howard Connor, a 5th Marine Division signal officer, saying: 'Were it not for the Navajos, the Marines would never have taken Iwo Jima.' Source: Naval History and Heritage . He explained how Harjo, who was part of the 195th Field Artillery Battalion, was walking through an orchard in southern France in 1944 when he heard a fellow soldier singing in the Creek dialect. A captain later heard the two soldiers talking, Boehner said, and immediately put them to work on opposite ends of a radio. 'Edmond and his brothers were at Normandy. They were on Iwo Jima. They mobilized the simplest weapon - language - to thwart the fiercest enemy free people have ever known,' Boehner said. 'And they made a difference. After serving with honor, they did the honorable thing. They kept their service a secret. Even to those that they loved.' Richard Harjo said there was some controversy following the ceremony because his uncle had been under the impression the medal was being presented to him, not the tribe. But the ceremony and honor still meant a lot to him, he added. 'He sought to do what was right and wanted that same recognition in return,' Richard Harjo said. He added that his uncle, a teacher and classical pianist, 'was a distinct character'. Harjo, like all code talkers, worked on the radio to transmit and receive messages. The . Native Americans were mainly used by the Marines, who had created an . unbreakable code created from the Navajo language by the tribe members in their ranks. The war-time efforts of Harjo and his fellow Native American code talkers inspired the 2002 Nicholas Cage film Windtalkers, which revealed the lengths the U.S. Marines went to protect their secret weapon. The skills and code talking ability of the Native Americans was so essential to the war effort that they were highly protected to prevent anything happening to them. A Japanese intelligence chief said after the war that although his forces could decipher codes used by the Army and Air Force, they remained unable to break the Marine code. Elite: Edmond Harjo was one of the Native American codetalkers used in the Second World War . Vital: The work of the Native American codetalkers was celebrated in the 2002 film Windtalkers . Part of the success of the code was the complexities of the Navajo language, which didn't have an alphabet and was understood by fewer than 30 people outside of the tribes. The codebreakers were assigned to transmit details of troop movements, tactics and messages over radio. The code was considered so valuable that it was kept classified for years, and the Native Americans who worked as codetalkers weren't recognized for their war efforts until 1992. In 2013 Harjo and other codetalkers were awarded the Congressional Gold Medal. Although he never married or had children, Harjo had many nieces and nephews who gathered to remember him at a service on April 4.","Edmond Harjo of the Seminole Nation sent secret messages during war .

"By . Lydia Warren . A Utah family whose 18-year-old daughter almost died after she was hit by a car while longboarding have befriended the driver in an astonishing show of compassion. Lexi Hansen was crossing the road on her longboard near Brigham Young University, where she is a freshman, on February 26 when Karson Pasker, also a BYU student, struck her with his car. Doctors told her parents that she had the brain activity 'of a chair' and warned that she had less than a five per cent chance of survival - so they were stunned when she awoke from her coma. Lexi, who also broke vertebrae, her neck and a leg, is now walking, talking and has returned home. Friends: Lexi Hansen, right, was not expected to survive after she was hit by a car driven by Karson Pasker, left, but she has miraculously pulled through and now her family are close to Pasker . After the accident, Lexi's family's immediately thought about the driver. They tried to contact him, but only learned his identity when he wrote them a letter a few days after the accident. Mrs Hansen called him to let him know that she knew mistakes happen - and to invite him for dinner. He was nervous when he turned up dressed in a suit, offering the family cupcakes. But he has now developed a friendship with the family, who are Mormon. 'From our side, I've never had any bad . feelings,' Lexi's mother Marcia told KSL. 'From the very beginning I just said, ""you feel like you're one of my kids,"" and gave him a big hug. Hurt: Lexi suffered a head injury and broke her neck, leg and vertebrae in the crash in February . Survivor: But she astonished doctors by waking from a coma and signing 'I love you' to her family. She is pictured with her mother Marcia, who called the driver and invited him to the family home for dinner . 'The only thing I ever felt was . sorry for him that he had to go through so much pain, and that we . couldn't find him sooner to let him know our feelings because I’m sure . that was a big part of why he felt so horrible - that he was worried . about how we felt.' He now visits the family at least once a week and is always sure to bring Mrs Hansen chocolates and a gift for her husband. Lexi's mother said her daughter is still in a lot of pain but is improving - a miraculous recovery just weeks after the family were warned they should prepare for organ donation. 'Here she is. She's walking, talking and doing everything. So we know God did this,' Marcia said. Pasker said he was touched by the kindness of the family. 'They've had a life-changing impact on me, to see their strength and their love,' Karson told KSL. Before: She was riding her longboard across a road as she had headphones in when she was hit . Miracle: Lexi, pictured before the accident, is now walking and talking and is improving every day . Hansen, who regularly . posts photos and videos of her longboarding feats to Facebook, was . riding on University Avenue near the BYU campus on Wednesday 26 February . when she was hit.

But . she was hit by the vehicle. Pasker immediately stopped and was not . issued with a citation, in what police have called an unfortunate . accident. Hansen was not wearing a helmet at the time and sustained a head injury that put her in a coma for several days. Support: Her large family, including her siblings (pictured), were singing hymns by her bed when she came out of her coma. Lexi (pictured third from right) then gave a hand signal for 'I love you', they said . Scene: She had her headphones in and was attempting to beat a car so that she could cross this intersection near BYU's campus - but the vehicle hit her and she suffered head injuries . 'While we were singing, . she hand signed, ""I love you,"" moving her arm around so that everyone . could see,' the family wrote on Facebook. 'She then reached for each person's hands individually so she . could squeeze them. We could hardly sing due to the tears streaming down . our face. We knew we were witnessing a miracle.' The teenager is a . communications major at BYU and wants to be a motivational speaker. Just ahead of the accident, she told her family that motivational . speakers had all suffered hardship. 'She said to me, ""You know, Mom, to be a . motivational speaker, everybody has been in some big accident or . something."" Yesterday I reminded her of that,' her mother said.","Lexi Hansen was struck by a car as she rode her longboard near Brigham Young University's campus in February and suffered serious head injuries .

"By . Associated Press . A railroad mechanic paralyzed in a deadly New York derailment says he forgives the man who was driving the train. Samuel . Rivera of Ossining, New York praised Metro-North Railroad on Wednesday as he announced a $100 . million lawsuit against it in his first public speech. He forgives 'overworked' driver William Rockefeller who fell asleep while driving. Rivera . spoke from a wheelchair at a rehabilitation center in suburban White . Plains, north of New York City. He has no movement of his legs and very . little in his arms. Samuel Rivera of Ossining, N.Y., speaks with reporters on Wednesday about his injuries, forgiving the train driver, and suing Metro-North . Pictured here is the passenger train derailment on Hudson line of metro North railroad, NYC on April 1 that injured Rivera . 'I . constantly live with nerve pain in my arms and hands, muscle spasms that . painfully twist and turn my spine, and bed sores that never seem to . heal,' the struggling Metro-North employee, Samuel Rivera said. Even . though he thanked his employer for not abandoning him after his . injuries on December 1, he said his suit against Metro-North is to . 'protect his family's financial future.' 'My care will costs hundreds of thousands of dollars each year,' Rivera said. Four . people were killed and more than 70 injured in the Dec. 1 derailment in . the Bronx. Investigators say the train was going 82 mph as it hit a . curve with a 30-mph speed limit. The driver, William Rockefeller, fell asleep at the wheel. Rivera is calling for legislation mandating seat belts on public transportation. Rivera believes that seat belts could have saved four of the lives lost in the derailment, reports The New York Post. 'I . must say you don’t realize what you have until it’s gone; simple things . like walking and hugging your kids,' he said in the remarks. Rivera's case happens to be the seventh case against Metro North surrounding the same incident. A railroad spokesman said on Wednesday that he could not comment because the lawsuit is pending. The driver of the train, William Rockefeller, who has been suspended without pay since the crash, worked an average of 762 overtime hours per year in 2010, 2011 and 2012, according to MTA data. On the basis that Metro-North drivers work a typical 40-hour work week of five eight-hour shifts, that's the equivalent of working a sixth day every week for three years straight.

"By . James Rush . Janice Schacter (pictured in 2005), who publicly trashed her lawyer husband, has been awarded just 17 per cent of his $5million partnership, after a judge found her allegations hurt his business . The wife of a New York lawyer who publicly trashed her husband has been awarded just 17 per cent of his $5million partnership, after a judge found her allegations hurt his business. Janice Schacter, 51, accused her now ex-husband Ira Schacter, 54, of being abusive and buying a Playboy model a $200,000 engagement ring while refusing to pay for his daughter's $12,000 hearing aids. She had made the allegations over the course of the couple's seven-year-long divorce battle, which Mr Schacter claimed damaged his business at Cadwalader, Wickersham and Taft. Justice Laura Drager agreed with Mr Schacter's claim and cut his ex-wife's share of the partnership from roughly $2.5million to $855,000, according to the New York Daily News. In the ruling, made public yesterday, Drager wrote that 'in essence, the wife chose to bite the hand that fed her.' She wrote: 'Although the court recognizes that the wife feels she was badly treated by the husband, her repeated attacks against him have played a part in diminishing his income.' The couple were married in 1988 and had two children, now aged 19 and 15, before splitting in 2007 after both were arrested for allegedly assaulting one another. Mr Schacter filed for divorce two days after his wife got an order of protection barring him from their home. Criminal charges, however, were dropped. In 2011 Mrs Schacter alleged her husband was not paying for his daughter's $12,000 hearing aids, but had spent more than $200,000 on an engagement ring for his then fiancee, Playboy model Lace Rose Allenius, who later reportedly broke off the engagement. In her ruling, Drager said the allegation about the hearing aids was wrong and said Mrs Schacter's allegations were a factor in her ex-husband's drop in business. Ira Schacter (left) was accused of spending more than $200,000 on an engagement ring for his then fiancee, Playboy model Lace Rose Allenius (right) According to the New York Post, the ruling described the divorce action as 'one of the most contentious litigations this court has ever presided over'. Mrs Schacter criticised the judge's ruling as she told the paper: 'I bit the hand that hurt me, not fed me.' The ruling however left Mrs Schacter with half of the couple's $10.5million in other assets, including proceeds from the sales of a $4.4million townhouse and a $4.5million summer home in Bridgehampton. She will also reportedly receive up to $21,000 a month in spousal and child support along with the couple's Lexus.","Janice Schacter accused lawyer husband Ira Schacter of being abusive .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A builder suffered weeks of agony and has needed two operations after he was bitten by a false widow spider. Dean Greenhill, 35, said the bite swelled up to the size of a tennis ball after he was bitten while working on an old building in south London. Mr Greenhill, of Ware, Hertfordshire, said he was on the roof of the building when he felt a pain in his leg and soon after found it difficult to walk. Agony: Builder Dean Greenhill, 35, needed two operations after he was bitten by a false widow spider . He told the Daily Star: 'First I went to an out-of-hours GP, but later I needed an operation to drain and clear the wound. Then it swelled up again and I had a second op. It's still not sorted, seven weeks on.' Remarkaby, after weeks off work, Mr Greenhill discovered another of the spiders at a different site, but this time kept well clear. Mr Greenhill is the latest reported case of a false widow spider bite in the UK. On Friday MailOnline reported how teenager Stephanie Georgiou feared she would lose her hand after she was bitten while watching a horror film at the cinema. She was rushed to hospital and needed . three operations after she was nipped by the spider on a date at the . Enfield cinema earlier this month. The . 18-year-old has been scarred for life and left so traumatised by the . experience that she has vowed to never go back to the cinema. Greenhill said the bite swelled up to the size of a tennis ball. Remarkaby, after weeks off work, Mr Greenhill discovered another of the spiders at a different site, but this time kept well clear . And last Monday, MailOnline reported how housewife Alison Blackburn, of Strood, Kent, has been left too scared to sleep in her own bedroom after she ended up in intensive care when she was bitten by one of the spiders. Ms Blackburn, 49, has been sleeping on her sofa as she is too terrified to return to the room where she was bitten. Surgeons had to drain the poison from her left foot after the attack, as her ankle ballooned and the pain spread to her pelvic area. Mr Greenhill is the latest reported case of a false widow spider bite in the UK . False widow spiders are distinctive for their shiny, black flesh, bulbous bodies, thick legs and skull-like patterns. Millions of false widows, Britain's most venomous spider, have been found across the UK and the population is believed to be growing. The species has a brown bulbous abdomen with cream markings that look like a skull. They have long legs and can reach about 15mm in size. Also known as steatoda nobilis, it is frequently confused for the black widow, which has deadly venom. The false widow was first spotted in the UK in Torquay, Devon, in 1879, and it is understood that it may have made its way to these shores from Madeira or the Canary Islands in a shipment of bananas. The Natural History Museum says that warmer summers mean the spider is spreading northwards through the UK, having been found mainly in southern England. HOW TO AVOID BITES AND WHAT TO DO IF YOU GET ONE . Do not disturb spiders if you can help it because they will usually only bite you if they feel threatened. To avoid being bitten while asleep, remove everything from under the bed so that the only way the spiders can get up on the bed is to crawl up one of the four legs. Do not leave clothes around in piles for long periods as spiders like to hide in them and shake shoes in case a spider has crawled in overnight. If you have a garage store things in plastic bags if you use them with your hands and feet and cannot see inside. Also seal cardboard boxes if you are storing items. If you are unfortunate enough to be bitten and have a reaction, pack the wound in ice and seek medical attention.","Dean Greenhill needed two operations following false widow spider bite .

The red flower was sent back by an American serviceman, with a letter, signed 'Chas', short for  Charles, to his 'Dearest girl'. A rare WW1 battlefield poppy sent in a love letter from the fields of France to an American sweetheart is to be auctioned later this month . The letter, written on American YMCA paper, titled 'On Active Service with the American Expeditionary Force', begins with the words 'Dear Girl, I love you so, for your prayers and your love. If prayers will aide and they will God will take care of everything.' The poignant letter was written on American YMCA paper and is expected to fetch around £5,000. The soldiers letter titled 'On Active Service with the American Expeditionary Force', said: 'Dear Girl, I love you so, for your prayers and your love. 'If prayers will aide and they will God will take care of everything. Of course it is hard to understand this war in regards to the Lords will and means of protecting his people - but I guess it was not intended that we should understand. 'In the meantime I must stop - sweet girl, I will be so careful and you must be good and write very often. 'Tell me everything as you do and let the French poppy which I am enclosing represent my kisses for you - dearest girl, all my love. Remember me to mother - yours Chas.' The letter continues: 'If prayers will aide and they will God will take care of everything. Of course it is hard to understand this war in regards to the Lords will and means of protecting his people - but I guess it was not intended that we should understand' Auctioneer, Charles Hanson, said: 'Sadly nothing is known about Chas, a United States Armed Soldier who was sent to Europe in WW1, or his dearest girl back home in the USA. 'We can be fairly sure - that the French poppy picked up by an American serviceman represents a latter battle of WW1, perhaps when victory was in sight.' The United States campaigns in WW1 saw the Expeditionary Forces fight in France alongside The French and British Allied Forces in the last year of the war against The Imperial German Forces. By May 1918 over 1,000,000 US troops were stationed in France, with half of them on the front lines. The AEF helped the French Army on the Western Front during the Aisne offensive in June 1918, fighting its major actions in Saint Mihiel in late 1918. Mr Hanson said: 'I am unaware of any other WW1 French poppies in American collections or museums, and certainly I feel the endearing nature of the letter, containing such romance and affection together with the French poppy representing love and remembrance, is something to be preserved for posterity. 'In the meantime I must stop - sweet girl, I will be so careful and you must be good and write very often. Tell me everything as you do and let the French poppy which I am enclosing represent my kisses for you - dearest girl, all my love. Remember me to mother - yours Chas' the letter concludes . 'Whilst we will never know whether Chas survived WW1, and returned to his beloved, his words live on reminding us of those brave men and their families.' The poppy has come to represent the immeasurable sacrifice made by comrades, and has become a lasting memorial to those who died in WW1. Mr Hanson said: 'Value is in the sentiment and what the letter represents - I hope the letter finds a new home and value is hard to assess - I hope it fulfils its heart strings and the pull is worldwide.' The rare battlefield poppy will be sold by Charles Hanson, manager of Hansons Auctioneers in Derbyshire, on Monday 28th April. The poppy was one of the few plants able to grow on the otherwise barren battlefields of World War One. It has since come to represent the huge sacrifice made by millions of . allied soldiers and become a lasting memorial to those who died in the conflict. The poppy was subsequently adopted by the Royal British Legion for their fundraising appeal in aid of those who served, and continue to serve, in the British Armed Forces, after its formation in 1921, with poppy wreaths used on Remembrance Day each year, to commemorate those who served.","Red flower sent back by an American serviceman, with letter signed 'Chas'

"By . Martin Robinson . Toyota is recalling more than 6.5milllion cars spanning nearly 30 models - including 2.3 million in North America and 35,000 in the UK - after it discovered a number of faults. The car manufacturer found in some models  airbags can deactivate, seats may move and steering columns could break, the company said today. No injuries or crashes have been reported related to the recalls but two reports of fires are linked to one of the problems, a defective engine starter that can keep the motor running. Mass recall: 35,000 Toyota vehicles, including the RAV4, have been found to have potentially dangerous faults . Faulty: The models involved include the Corolla, RAV4, Matrix, Yaris - one of which is pictured here, the Highlander, and Tacoma. By region, the latest recall affects 2.3 million vehicles in North America, 1.09 million vehicles in Japan and 810,000 vehicles in Europe. Other regions affected by the recall include Africa, South America and the Middle East. The models involved include the Corolla, . RAV4, Matrix, Yaris, Highlander, and Tacoma. The Pontiac Vibe and the . Subaru Trezia are also affected. In some RAV4 and Hilux models, Toyota said there was a risk that the driver's airbag may be deactivated because turning the steering wheel could damage certain circuits, causing the airbag warning light on the instrument panel to illuminate. In some Toyota Yaris and Urban Cruiser models a spring mechanism locking the driver and, in three-door cars, the front passenger seats in position on the adjustment rails may be under-strength and could break if seats are frequently moved back and forwards. If the spring breaks, seats may not lock in position and could move in a crash, Toyota said. In the same models, a weld connecting the steering column bracket to the instrument panel might break when the steering wheel is repeatedly turned with full force, which could cause the steering column to tilt out of position. Drivers would not lose control of their vehicle. Toyota said customers would have their cars inspected and repaired free and urged people to check if their vehicle was affected by looking up its registration on the company website. Toyota was embroiled in a massive recall crisis in the U.S. starting in late 2009 and continuing through 2010, covering a wide range of problems including faulty floor mats, sticky gas pedals and defective brakes. Danger: Models including the Urban Cruiser are affected by a global Toyota recall after concerns were raised over airbag faults and fire risks . Last month, the Japanese automaker reached a settlement with the U.S. Justice Department to pay a $1.2 billion penalty for hiding information about defects in its cars. It earlier paid fines of more than $66 million for delays in reporting unintended acceleration problems. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration never found defects in electronics or software in Toyota cars, which had been targeted as a possible cause. The Pontiac Vibe, which is a General Motors Co. model, is involved because Toyota and GM made cars at the same plant in California and the recalled model is the same as the Toyota Matrix. Subaru is partly owned by Toyota, and the model was the same as the Toyota Ractis.","Toyota is recalling 6.5 million cars worldwide including 2.3 million in North America and 35,000 in the UK .

"By . Jill Reilly . A woman has undergone surgery to remove shrapnel from her stomach after her husband threw a grenade at her in the street following an argument . A woman has undergone surgery to remove shrapnel from her stomach after her husband allegedly threw a grenade at her in the street following an argument. A 55-year-old Bosnian man is being questioned after the incident in the town of Buchs in the canton of Aargau, Switzerland. According to a report from the SDA news agency the 59-year-old woman, who was estranged from her husband, alerted police to the attack about an hour after it happened. She initially attempted to minimise the incident and said she only had a finger injury. But she was in pain and a hospital admission revealed she had shaprnel embedded into her stomach. Investigators discovered parts of the grenade in the street - it was so powerful its detonation blew out a window in a nearby house, reported The Local. Together with the Forensic Institute Zurich, investigators came to the conclusion that it was a 'splinter grenade' hand-made in the former Yugoslavia. The 55-year-old Bosnian man is being questioned after the incident in the town of Buchs in the canton of Aargau, Switzerland (pictured) An analysis showed that the grenade was hand-made years ago, according to police. The man - who has not been named - was caught on Sunday at the Italian border in Chiasso, in the canton of Ticino, after he returned from a brief visit to his home country. It is not clear what the motive for the hand grenade attack was. The woman is understood to be recoveing well and an investigation into the case continues.","A 55-year-old Bosnian man is being questioned after the incident .

"By . Jessica Jerreat . A 20-year-old welding student from Philadelphia was killed on Monday afternoon when a train struck him as he walked along the tracks while texting. Andre Washington, who was hit at about 4.30pm, never looked round at the train that was coming up behind him while sounding its horn. The conductor of the SEPTA train tried to hit the brakes and alert Mr Washington, but he was unable to stop in time. Hit: Andre Washington, 20, was struck and killed by a train on Monday afternoon . Mr Washington, who was due to graduate from the Eastern Center for Arts and Technology later this year, was on the way to see a friend when he was struck by the commuter train, which was carrying about 500 passengers. He died at the scene, near Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority's Noble station in Jenkintown. In his statement to police, the . conductor, who has not been named, said Mr Washington had his back to . the train as it came round a bend in the tracks. 'The victim never once flinched, . turned around, looked at [the conductor] or indicated that he knew the train was . coming,' Deputy Chief John Livingwood told 6ABC. Warning: The conductor tried to alert Andre, center, by sounding the horn but the student didn't hear him . Loss: Andre, pictured with girlfriend Mandy Lee Llanos, was due to graduate later this year . Despite applying the brakes and sounding the horn, the conductor was unable to get the attention of the victim. 'It doesn't make sense: He would've heard, he should've heard,' Andre Washington Sr, who shares the same name as his son, said. 'We're still grieving. The whole thing is just too much to think about.' The victim's grandmother, Beverly Washington, said she couldn't understand why Mr Washington chose to walk on the tracks. 'My thoughts are all up in the air. When they told me what had happened, I could barely understand them, . through my crying,' she told Philly.com. She paid tribute to her grandson, who 'cared about everybody and would do anything to help'. Kind-hearted: Andre's family paid tribute to the 20-year-old who was always willing to help . In a tragic twist of fate, the day after Mr Washington's death, a nationwide campaign to raise awareness of track dangers was promoted by SEPTA. The See Tracks? Think Train! campaign, by national group Operation Lifesaver, was launched on April 8 to help reduce the number of injuries around railway tracks. SEPTA spokeswoman Heather Redfern told Mail Online: 'The launch of the program had been previously scheduled for April 8, the timing with the incident at Noble Station is an unfortunate coincidence.' She added that a full investigation into Mr Washington's death is underway.","Andre Washington never saw the train coming, conductor says .

"By . Snejana Farberov . Police in Los Angeles announced Tuesday that two young women who were discovered dead nine months apart three years were abducted and murdered by the same perpetrator. Michelle Lozano, 17, was kidnapped from Lincoln High School in April 2011. Her nude body was discovered dumped the next day on the 5 Freeway near the Los Angeles Cesar Chavez Avenue exit. In January 2012, 22-year-old Bree'Anna Guzman, a mother of two, was discovered dead near the 5 and 2 Freeway interchange a month after being reported missing. Scroll down for videos . Brutal murders: LAPD determined that the same person or people abducted and killed Michelle Lozano, 17 (left),  and 22-year-old Bree'Anna Guzman (right) more than nine months apart three years ago . Horrific discovery: Lozano's nude body was found stuffed in a container left in the brush off the 5 Freeway in April 2011 . Crime scene: Guzman's badly decomposed and partially nude body turned up along the Riverside Drive on-ramp in January 2012 - a month after her disappearance . The two murders were not originally linked by investigators, but during a press conference Tuesday, LAPD Capt. William Hayes said that forensic evidence collected from the two crime scenes has led police to conclude that both crimes were committed by the same person. Police say they have no descriptions of a suspect or a vehicle, and are now appealing to the public to come forward with clues, Los Angeles Times reported. The Los Angeles City Council announced two $50,000 rewards for information leading to the arrest of the person or persons responsible for the slayings. ‘We know that there are people out there that know something and we just need their help,’ Anne Flores, Lozano’s sister, said during Tuesday’s emotional press conference attended by relatives of both victims. Michelle Lozano was last seen alive at around 4pm on April 24, 2011, on North Broadway in Lincoln Heights. Public plea: LAPD and City Council officials held a press conference attended by the victims' families, where they announced a $100,000 reward for information leading to the killer's arrest . Emotionlal relatives: Darlene Guzman (left), Bree'Anna's mother, and Michelle's mother and sister (right), asked eyewitnesses to come froward and help find justicefor their slain loved ones . At around 11.30pm the following day, the teen's naked body was discovered wrapped in plastic and stuffed inside a container in the brush just off the 5 Freeway. The medical examiner determined that the 17-year-old high school student had been strangled to death by her assailant. Bree'Anna Guzman was last seen just before 8pm December 26, 2011, when she told her mother, Darlene, that she was going to get cough drops from a Rite Aid pharmacy in Lincoln Heights. On January 26, Guzman's badly decomposed and partially nude body turned up along the Riverside Drive on-ramp. Kidnapped: Michelle Guzman was abducted from her high school a day before she was found dead . Gone too soon: Guzman was a mother of two young girls (one pictured right), and she aspired to become a pastry chef . Bree'Anna's mother was on hand for the Tuesday police news conference announcing a break in the murder cases. 'She was loved by some many people,' Guzman said, sporting a T-shirt with her daughter's picture. It does not appear like the 17-year-old Lozano and 22-year-old Guzman knew each other, according to KTLA. LA Weekly reported that there have been reports of other unsolved cases involving bodies discarded on the Eastside of LA and around Los Angeles County, but so far no connections have been detected between Lozano and Guzman's murders, and the other alleged victims. Detectives are now checking databases in Southern California and beyond to look for similar cases in an effort to determine if a serial killer may be behind Guzman and Lozano's deaths, NBC 4 reported.","Michelle Lozano, 17, was kidnapped from Lincoln High School in April 2011 and found nude inside container a day later .

"By . James Rush . Former Tonight Show host Jay Leno has spoken for the first time on the news of his old rival David Letterman's planned retirement next year. The comedian opened up about the news by joking: 'Oh well you know, he and I [are] gonna do The Sunshine Boys on Broadway, so we're very excited about that.' Letterman announced that he was to retire as host of the Late Show next year, after 22 years at its helm, at the taping of the show last Thursday afternoon. Jay Leno (left) has spoken for the first time on the news that his old rival David Letterman (right) is to retire next year . When asked who he thinks should replace the beloved host, Leno told Extra: 'I don't know a lot of good people out there.' The two had been rivals since NBC picked Leno over Letterman to replace Johnny Carson as the host of the Tonight Show in 1992, resulting in a public and bitter feud. Letterman left the network for its competitor CBS, and launched his own talk show in the same timeslot as Tonight, going head-to-head with Leno and initially beating him in the ratings. Leno, 63, hosted his last Tonight Show after 22 years in February, before handing over the reins to comedian Jimmy Fallon, scoring his highest ratings in 15 years with an impressive 14.6million viewers. And with Fallon doing so well as the Tonight Show host, NBC's boss on Monday expressed no fear about who will replace Letterman upon his planned retirement. NBC Universal CEO Steve Burke declared Fallon 'is the best and no matter who CBS puts in that place, I think he'll still be the best'.

Tina Fey or Leno himself, two people with NBC ties who have been . mentioned as potential Letterman replacements, would be in the running. Fallon . has topped the late-night ratings since taking over from Leno, and is particularly strong among the young audience NBC seeks. While the network was . always confident in Fallon, Burke said the new host has easily exceeded . expectations, and is even bringing viewers back to the 11:30pm time . slot. Announcing his retirement next year, Letterman thanked the network and his fans last Thursday.

During the taping, Letterman announced he . had informed CBS Corporation's president Leslie Moonves that he will . step down as host in 2015, when his current contract expires. 'The . man who owns this network, Leslie Moonves, he and I have had a . relationship for years and years and years, and we have had this . conversation in the past, and we agreed that we would work together on . this circumstance and the timing of this circumstance,' Letterman said. 'I . phoned him just before the program, and I said ""Leslie, it’s been . great, you’ve been great, and the network has been great, but I’m . retiring"". 'I just want to . reiterate my thanks for the support from the network, all of the people . who have worked here, all of the people in the theater, all the people . on the staff, everybody at home, thank you very much. 'What this means now, is that Paul and I . can be married,' he added, in reference to his music director Paul Shaffer, as his announcement was greeted with a . standing ovation at the Ed Sullivan Theater. U.S. President Barack Obama appeared on the Late Show with David Letterman in September 2012 .

Letterman, 66, who is also a television and film producer, has been at the helm of the CBS show for 20 years, before which he hosted NBC's Late Night for 11 years.

It was hailed by the New York Daily News as 'one of the purest, most honest and important moments in TV history', according to CBS.

"By . Ted Thornhill . Criticism: Departing SEC attorney James Kidney said in his leaving speech that his bosses were too fearful of Wall Street chiefs . A lawyer from America’s Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has launched a broadside against his bosses during a leaving speech, accusing them of being too soft on wayward Wall Street chiefs in the wake of the 2008 credit crisis. James Kidney, who retired from the SEC this month after 24 years with the organisation, said in his leaving speech that his bosses had been too ‘tentative and fearful’ when tackling the behaviour of banking giants. As around 70 SEC lawyers and alumni looked on, Mr Kidney bemoaned the SEC’s focus on being polite. He said: ‘[The SEC has become] an agency that polices the broken windows on the street level and rarely goes to the penthouse floors. On the rare occasions when enforcement does go to the penthouse, good manners are paramount. Tough enforcement, risky enforcement, is subject to extensive negotiation and weakening.’ Financial penalties meted out by the SEC were ‘at most a tollbooth on the bankster turnpike’, he said, according to Bloomberg News. He added: ‘I have had bosses, and bosses of my bosses, whose names we all know, who made little secret that they were here to punch their ticket. They mouthed serious regard for the mission of the commission, but their actions were tentative and fearful in many instances.’ One of the SEC’s most headline-grabbing cases post-credit crisis was against Goldman Sachs, which paid $550million in July 2010 to settle claims it had committed fraud in a complicated transaction involving securities known as collateralised debt obligations. The scheme’s principal architect, Fabrice Tourre, was also sued by the SEC, which said he epitomised 'Wall Street greed’ during his trial last year.

All six of the dogs were without food, water, or shade but that pit bull was in such bad shape she had to be immediately transported to a veterinarian for treatment. It was later discovered that the pit bull only weighed a meager 25 pounds. This poorly cared for pit bull weighed a shockingly low 25 pounds when Animal Rescue officers found her . The dogs, who were kept in this cage on an Arizona property, were without shade, food, or water .

The next morning Animal Care officers contacted the owner and found that the dogs' 'caretaker' did have food available to feed his animals, reports AZ Central. He claimed to feed his dogs on a daily basis but officers had a difficult time believing that due to the haggard appearance of all of the pets.

"By . Jill Reilly . Crocodiles are some of the most feared predators in Africa, ruthless reptiles renowned for tearing their prey to pieces before swallowing hunks of meat raw. But in the baking sun at Nyanyana crocodile farm on the shores of Zimbabwe's Lake Kariba, feeding time has a surreal edge as the beasts nibble lazily at bowls of vegetarian pellets. Besides being cheaper than meat, the diet of protein concentrate, minerals, vitamins, maize meal and water is said to enhance crocodile skin destined to become handbags or shoes on the catwalks of New York, Paris, London or Milan. In the baking sun at Nyanyana crocodile farm on the shores of Zimbabwe's Lake Kariba, feeding time has a surreal edge as the beasts nibble lazily at bowls of vegetarian pellets . 'We don't feed them meat any more,' said Oliver Kamundimu, financial director of farm owner Padenga Holdings. 'It actually improves the quality because we now measure all the nutrients that we are putting in there, which the crocodile may not get from meat only,' he told Reuters in an interview. Four hundred kilometres (250 miles) northwest of Harare, Nyanyana is home to 50,000 Nile crocodiles and is one of three Padenga farms around Kariba, Africa's largest man-made lake. The company has 164,000 crocodiles in all and started feeding pellets in 2006 at the height of an economic crisis in Zimbabwe that made meat scarce and very expensive. A crocodile swims inside a pen at Nyanyana Crocodile Farm in Kariba. Besides being cheaper than meat, the diet is said to enhance crocodile skin destined to become handbags or shoes on the catwalks of New York, Paris, London or Milan . Initially, the pellets contained 50 percent meat but that has gradually been phased out to an entirely vegetarian diet. 'We have moved gradually to a point where we reduced the meat to about 15 percent then to seven percent and where we are now there is zero meat, zero fish,' he said. 'It's a much cleaner operation and the crocs are getting all the nutrients they want from that pellet.' Fed every second day, the crocodiles are largely docile and lie asleep in their enclosures as workers walk around casually cleaning up leftovers. The crocodilies are slaughtered at 30 months, when they are about 1.5 metres long and their skin is soft and supple. Posh Spice with another of her croc skin accessories and actress Eva Longoria flaunts one of hers . Last year Harare-listed Padenga sold 42,000 skins to tanneries in Europe, especially France, where the average skin fetches $550. Ninety percent of the leather becomes high-end handbags, Kamundimu said, while the remainder makes belts, shoes and watch straps for some of the biggest names in world fashion. 'When you hear names like Hermes, Louis Vuitton and Gucci - those are the brand names we are talking about,' he said with a satisfied smile. Having survived economic collapse and hyperinflation of 500 billion percent in Zimbabwe, Padenga then had to deal with fallout from the 2008 global financial crisis, and economic contraction in the euro zone, its main market. However, while appetite for crocodile meat cooled in Europe and Asia, super-wealthy European shoppers shrugged off recession and continued to snap up crocodile-skin items, Kamundimu said. 'When you look at people who buy handbags for their wives or daughters that cost $40,000 a piece, even when the euro zone problems came, they could still afford to buy,' he said. We didn't feel a decline.'","Nyanyana crocodile farm is on the shores of Zimbabwe's Lake Kariba .

After the shooting, officials in the city of just over 2,500 people held public hearings but decided to keep Hassani on the force. Shooting: Tarek Hassani, of the Filer Police Department in Idaho, was filmed firing his gun a point blank range after being called to reports of dogs wandering in the street . That angered some residents, who accused officials of not doing enough, the Twin Falls Times-News reported. Petitions to recall Mayor Rick Dunn and all four City Council members were filed Tuesday. Dunn . told The Associated Press that residents have every right to seek a . recall but he didn’t go so far as to speculate whether or not the . attempt to oust him would be successful. 'I . think they're going to do their best to make the recall work,' he said. 'They only needed 20 (signatures) to start the process, and they've . gotten that far.' Recall . organizers gathered 20 signatures for each city leader's recall . petition, a procedural step that triggers an official drive. That gives organizers 75 days to try to get a larger amount of signatures, a required 201 per official. Working: The seven-year-old black Labrador named Hooch acted as a service dog for Parkinson's disease sufferer Rick Clubb . That . figure is 20 per cent of the number of voters registered in the last . city election. If Twin Falls County approves the petitions, the city . will hold a recall election. Hassani . was placed on administrative leave shortly after he shot and killed a . 7-year-old black Labrador named Hooch on February 8. The officer responded to a call of dogs running loose at a home in Filer when two of the animals began to circle him. Video . taken by a police dashboard-mounted camera shows Hooch and another dog . barking at the officer and sometimes lunging toward him. Hassani kicked . at Hooch before shooting him. The . dog's death launched protests and fiery testimony at Filer City Council . meetings, where many residents called for Hassani's firing. An . investigation by the Police Department of Nampa, about 150 miles . northwest of Filer, found the shooting was justified but the independent . inquiry questioned why the officer didn't stay in his vehicle, call the . owner of the dogs or call for backup. Shot: The dog, named Hooch (pictured), would not stop barking at the officer so he kicked it and then fatally shot it . A phone number for Hassani could not be located. Mark . Deaton, a former longtime Filer resident, told the newspaper that he . and others were concerned that there was no warning when the officer . returned to work. 'What we . found out through this whole ordeal is no officers in Idaho get any kind . of training in aggressive dog handling,' he said. Filer . officials have scheduled an eight-hour training session on how to deal . with aggressive dogs for May 3. It will be required for Filer police, . and officers from other towns also plan to attend. Officers . have had to escort people off Hassani's property since the shooting, . Dunn said. The mayor said he's received death threats but that he didn't . take them very seriously. But it upset him that people across the country were getting a negative perceptive of his town based on the incident, Dunn said. 'I hate to see that,' he said. 'Filer is a nice town: We have good staff, good people here. Give Filer a little more credit than this.'","Police officer shot and killed 'Hooch' on February 8 but now residents of Filer, Idaho are trying to fire the mayor over the scandal .

"By . Associated Press . and James Rush . Television network NBC has turned to its viewers in a bid to discover the latest hit sitcom. The initiative, dubbed 'NBC Comedy Playground', will give up to 10 finalists the chance to each create a pilot and a formal presentation to be judged by a panel of celebrities. NBC said the two winners will then be chosen to create half-hour comedies to air on the network during the summer next year. Comedy stars Jason Bateman (left) and Mindy Kaling (right) are among the panel of celebrities who will judge the NBC Comedy Playground finalists . Previous NBC successes include the television comedy series Frasier (from left to right Jane Leeves as Daphne Moon, David Hyde Pierce as Niles Crane, Kelsey Grammer as Frasier Crane, John Mahoney as Martin Crane, Peri Gilpin as Roz Doyle and Moose as Eddie the dog) NBC Entertainment President Jennifer Salke told Entertainment Weekly: 'We are taking a bold, alternative approach in what we hope will uncover original comedy minds who are looking for a way to get into the television business.' The top two ideas will be chosen by an advisory board including Eva Longoria, Sean Hayes, Mindy Kaling, Seth Meyers and Jason Bateman. Another prize, the chance to create an online comedy, will be decided by a public vote. The network has featured many of the most famous and best-loved American sitcoms ever, including Frasier, Seinfeld and Friends . More recent successes for the network have included The Office and 30 Rock. The broadcaster's comedy output has not performed as well in recent years however. Actress Eva Longoria, who starred in Desperate Housewives, will also be among the panel of celebrity judges . U.S. comedy hit Seinfeld (left) was also originally shown on NBC while Friends (right) was also a huge success for the broadcaster . More recently, sitcoms including The Office (starring from left to right Steve Carrell, John Krasinski and Rainn Wilson) have provided hits for NBC . Shows from this season, including Sean Saves The World, have also failed to live up to previous successes. The move is the latest crowd-sourcing concept to have been used in the television development process - Amazon recently put all of their pilots online so viewers could choose their favourite. Application videos for the NBC Comedy Playground can be submitted online at nbccomedyplayground.com from May 1.","NBC will give up to ten finalists chance to create pilots and presentation .

"By . James  Nye . A shocking photograph of a sick and distressed coyote cramped into a tiny cage has again placed Animal Planet's troubled Call of the Wildman reality show firmly under the spotlight. According to the whistleblower who took the depressing picture, the coyote had been captured and held for three days beforehand for use in a scripted scene in which the show's star,  Ernie 'Turtleman' Brown, Jr., lures and traps a wild coyote lurking in a barn. Even more damning for Animal Planet, the person who provided the photograph alleges that when the time came to film the scene, the coyote was too sick, so the show runners paid $500 to have another one transported from Ohio to Kentucky - which is illegal. Caged: This is the coyote that was allegedly held while sick for Animal Planet's Call of the Wildman show for use in filming in May 2013 . It is then alleged, that even with the replacement coyote on set, the producers still brought the sick one on location for the May 10, 2013 filming, 'just in case something happens'. The scripted segment was aired in the episode Lured into Danger in July 2013 and was filmed on May 10, 2013 in Waddy, Kentucky, three days after the photograph of the caged coyote was taken in Bowling Green Kentucky. According to an investigation by Mother Jones, Sharp Entertainment - the production company commissioned by Animal Planet to make Call of the Wildman - obtained the first coyote through the Kentucky Nuisance Wildlife Control Operators (NWCO). Mother Jones' investigation also alleges that even though the sick coyote was captured by a licensed wildlife control operator - the show broke Kentucky regulations that forbid keeping captive wildlife for more than 48 hours. More-so, the investigation also got hold of government documents that show state wildlife regulators had been warning Turtleman about violations and animal welfare issues since March 2012. According to the allegations of the man who provided the photograph, a NWCO official captured the coyote at the request of the show and 'was transported for hours in cramped conditions'. Reality show: The show follows the exploits of Kentucky woodsman Ernie Brown, Jr., nicknamed 'The Turtleman' as he traps nuisance animals across the United States . However, it is not known if the coyote was kept inside the cage it was pictured in for three whole days, but regardless, as the May 10 shoot approached the coyote was sick and had begun to limp. The fact it was brought to the filming location along with its replacement left the source who provided the photograph to Mother Jones, 'sickened'. Another person who witnessed the coyote said that it 'was just sitting there, so they had to get another coyote fairly quickly.' Internal documents obtained from Sharp Entertainment reveal that the second coyote was obtained from Kokas Exotics, a farm in Ohio that breeds exotic animals. Its owner, John Kokas made the news in 2011 when one of his own kangaroos attacked and injured him. The new coyote was fetched by staffers from Sharp on May 9 for $500 and brought to Kentucky. This is against Kentucky law and while the state can exempt zoos or researchers to do this, it is uncommon. Friends: Eric Brown is aided in the show by his friend Neal James - but it has come under fire in the last year for allegations of animal cruelty during filming . Chad Soard, an official with the Kentucky Department of Fish and Wildlife Resources told Mother Jones the main concern is rabies. According to Kentucky officials there are no recorded exemptions dated on May 9 or 10 for the transportation of a coyote into Kentucky. So far representatives from Animal Planet and Sharp Entertainment have refused to comment on the matter. However, Sharp’s Vice President Dan Adler denied the practice of snaring animals deliberately for the reality show and insisted that the 'coyote in question was determined to be sick by the licensed officers on location, and the determination was made not to film with it because production policy is not to film with sick or injured animals. 'On the day in question you bring up, a licensed NWCO officer arrived to a location with a coyote he had caught after receiving a nuisance call, and when he brought it to us, the licensed NWCO officers on set moved it from the smaller cage it was caught in to an appropriately sized cage.' In its tagline, Call of the Wildman is supposed to give nusiance wildlife 'a second lease on life.' During previous allegations that the show is too scripted, Sharp Entertainment has said that  'NWCO officers are compensated for bringing animals to production that they have captured in the regular course of their work.' Commissioned: Animal Planet have said 'The notion that there is a culture of 'neglect' at the only network that is devoted to celebrating and protecting animals is absurd' Animal rights groups, already sickened by prior allegations of abuse by the show have called for the show to be axed. 'It appears that numerous Kentucky animal-protection laws were violated in the way that this ailing coyote was handled, and PETA is filing a complaint with the Kentucky Department of Fish & Wildlife Resources,' said People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA), Foundation Deputy Counsel, Delcianna Winders. 'PETA will also file a complaint with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service regarding numerous apparent violations of the federal Lacey Act in the production of this episode of ‘Call of the Wildman’ and numerous others.' Earlier this year, Mother Jones allaged that the production team associated with Call of the Wildman mistreated animals and 'found ""evidence of a culture that tolerated legally and ethically dubious activities.' The allegations included a zebra being sedated and animals being trapped beforehand only to be caught again as part of a script. Legal warnings for Call of the Wildman: In August 2013, Kentucky Fish and Wildlife sent Ernie Brown a warning letter that some of his actions on the show were a violation of his Nuisance Wildlife Control Officer permit . Animal Planet released a statement to CNN's New Day, saying in part: . 'The life and welfare of all animals is of paramount importance to Animal Planet. It is core to our ethos that every animal's life has value... The notion that there is a culture of 'neglect' at the only network that is devoted to celebrating and protecting animals is absurd. 'Claims in the 'Mother Jones' article were brought to the production company's attention nearly nine months ago. Where appropriate, Sharp Entertainment promptly instituted changes to further ensure the welfare of animals while filming the series.' it read. Dan Adler, senior vice president of Sharp Entertainment, said ""The idea that there is a culture of neglect or abuse on the show is completely false ... Everyone on the show from staff to talent love animals.' 'The idea that animals are killed or drugged on 'Call of the Wildman' is false,' he said. The U.S. Department of Agriculture, which enforces the Animal Welfare . Act, told CNN in January it is 'fact-finding' but has not launched an . investigation.","Photograph shows 'sick and unresponsive' coyote captured for use in Call of the Wildman on set in Kentucky in May 2013 .

Voters in the mountain community of Divide have been deciding between various animals at the ballot box.

Paws for thought: The full list of candidates competing in the Divide election, which is running to raise money for the Teller County Regional Animal Shelter . Who you calling Buster! A local cat 'competing' for the unofficial title of mayor in a promotional online race to raise funds for a shelter in Divide, Colorado . The election, however, isn’t an official one, unsurprisingly. It is actually being run to raise money for the Teller County Regional Animal Shelter and awareness for groups like Teller County Search and Rescue. Each vote means $1 for the shelter, and voters have been clicking from round the country. Election that has gone to the dogs: Pa Kettle the bloodhound is a favorite to win . Voting began in February, and chief operating officer Mary Steinbeiser says about $9,000 had been raised by Monday. That will pay for scores of spaying or neutering operations. Steinbeiser says she likes Pa Kettle the soulful-eyed bloodhound the best. 'Anyone of them would be a good mayor,' Marti Benson, a local vet, said. Nancy Adams, the fundraising coordinator, said: 'Most of them say, ""are you kidding?"" And we say, ""no. We're not kidding""'She added that the last election they held raised about $8,800 and the current one has surpassed $9,000, which will go towards helping hundreds of abandoned animals each year.","Mayoral election in Divide, Colorado, featured eleven animals .

"By . James  Nye . In a powerful, open-letter a soldier whose life was saved by a brave colleague during the Fort Hood shooting has described the desperate attempts of his fellow brothers-in-arms to resuscitate him after he had been fatally wounded. In the letter posted to Facebook, First Lieutenant Patrick Cook hails the ultimate sacrifice of Sgt. First Class Daniel Ferguson as he barricaded closed a door that wouldn't lock - crucially keeping shooter Spc. Ivan Lopez outside. In one horrific passage, Cook recalls how one week on he can still 'taste the blood' of Ferguson in his mouth only to then rage and demand the 'God-given-right' for soldiers to be armed on base to prevent another massacre happening again. Tribute: First Lieutenant Patrick Cox (left) posted his open letter onto Facebook on Monday night in which he praised Sergeant First Class Daniel Ferguson (right) and was deeply critical of authorities who insist on keeping military bases weapons-free zones . The gripping and tragic account of the 20 minute siege written by Cook, is one part tribute and one part judgement of gun-laws on military bases. Cook describes how Ferguson, a 21-year Army veteran who had served in both Gulf Wars and Afghanistan rushed to the aid of his comrades as 34-year-old Lopez began to unleash his rampage on Fort Hood on Wednesday which left three dead and 16 injured. The 39-year-old wedged himself up against an door that wouldn't lock as Lopez tried to enter - saving his colleagues and Cook. Outlining how he found himself 'trapped in an enclosed room with fourteen of my fellow Soldiers, one of whom was barricading the door against a madman with a .45 pistol when he was fatally shot,' Cook reveals Ferguson to be a hero. Not again: Soldiers watch Fort Hood news from Fort Irwin on CNN - Fort Hood was the scene of a mass shooting in 2009 which left 13 people including the shooter dead . Hero: Sgt. First Class Danny Ferguson, who sacrificed his life to save his fellow soldiers during the Fort Hood rampage, is seen in a Facebook photo with his fiancée Kristen Haley . 'Through what I can only describe as a miracle, he somehow found enough strength to continue pushing against that door until the shooter gave up and went elsewhere, at which time he collapsed,' Cook wrote. 'Nearly a week later, I can still taste his blood in my mouth from when I and my comrades breathed into his lungs for 20 long minutes while we waited for a response from the authorities. 'This Soldier’s name was Sergeant First Class Daniel Ferguson, and his sacrifice loaned me the rest of my life to tell this story.' Using the last of his strength to prevent Lopez from entering the room, Ferguson's colleagues tried in vain to save him. Response: Ivan Lopez, who was battling mental illness, shot dead three people and wounded 16 others with a recently purchased pistol before turning the gun on himself at Fort Hood on Wednesday . However, Cook uses his letter not to simply praise his fallen comrade but to call for the repeal of regulations that disarm military personnel on military bases. 'But I write to you today not to memorialize this brave Soldier, nor to tell a war story about how we made the best of a losing situation, but to express the part of that story that some in high positions of power clearly do not want told: I knew this was going to happen,' he wrote. 'I had been saying for five years that Fort Hood was a tinderbox of another massacre waiting to happen. 'It had to happen, because our betters failed to learn the obvious lesson of five years ago. Worse yet, I know it will happen again. 'More will die, more will be wounded, more families will be torn apart, needlessly. It happened again, and will happen again, because Fort Hood is a gun free zone.' Gun-free-zone: Spc. Ivan Lopez opened fire in the Fort Hood Army base area in central Texas on April 2, 2014 injuring 16 people and killing three before turning the gun on himself . Cook described the 'utter helplessness' he felt that night when he reached for his belt 'for something that wasn’t there.' 'As the shooter kicked at the door, I remember telling myself, ‘oh well, this is it.’ It is beneath human dignity to experience the utter helplessness I felt that day. I cannot abide the thought that anyone should ever feel that again,' he said. Cook also said that another massacre will happen if things are not addressed and do not change. 'It happened again, and will happen again, because Fort Hood is a gun free zone,' he said. 'To those of you who hold elected office, if you hear nothing else I have told you, hear this: you have the power to stop the next massacre from happening. 'You have an opportunity to restore the sacred Right to bear arms, which has been either stripped entirely or unjustly relegated to the poor substitute of a probationary, government-issued privilege. For God’s sake, do the right thing.' The letter was read Monday at the Texas Senate committee on Constitutional Carry, Mr. Cook said on Facebook.","First Lieutenant Patrick Cook posted letter to Facebook which describes the heroism of Sgt.

"By . John Hall . The US has announced plans to place 50 nuclear missiles in storage as part of a controversial arms treaty with Russia. The Pentagon said it would be keeping its current force of 450 land-based missiles, but has agreed to remove 50 of them from launch silos - although it added these silos would be maintained so they could return to active use in future. The removal is part of a plan to bring the US into compliance with an 2011 arms control treaty with Russia known as New START - which has the subject of intense debate between U.S. politicians and weapons experts when plans were announced ahead of the 2010 mid-term elections. Defence: A Minuteman III rocket is launched from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California. The test base is one of the sites that will not be hit with missile reductions . Aim: U.S. President Barack Obama shake hands with his Russian counterpart Dmitry Medvedev, after signing the controversial New START treaty in 2011 . Once the 50 nuclear missiles are placed in storage, the launch-ready total of 400 . Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missiles would be the lowest the US has had since 1962 . The decision to keep the silos in 'warm' status - empty of missiles but capable of returning to active use - comes after members of Congress from the states that host missile bases - North Dakota, Wyoming and Montana - warned they must not be dismantled. Senator John Tester, a Montana Democrat, called the Pentagon's announcement 'a big win for our nation's security and for Malmstrom Air Force Base,' home of the 341st Missile Wing with 150 Minuteman 3 missiles. 'ICBMs . are the most cost-effective nuclear deterrent, and keeping silos warm . is a smart decision and the kind of common sense Montanans expect from . their leaders,' he added. The decision to put 50 missiles in . storage but not eliminate any of their launch silos is a departure from . the practice followed throughout the 50-plus year history of . intercontinental ballistic missiles. A . senior defense official who briefed reporters on the plan and its . rationale said the Pentagon had never before structured its ICBM force . with a substantial number of missiles in standby status. The official spoke under Pentagon ground rules that did not permit her name to be used. In the air: U.S. Air Force strategic bombers will be trimmed from the current deployed total of 93 to 60 - including 19 B-2 stealth bombers (pictured) - with an additional six bombers available in a non-deployed status . Despite the 2011 New START deal, both Russia and the US have an extensive nuclear weapons arsenal. In US hands there are approximately 5,114 nuclear warheads, including tactical, strategic, and non-deployed weapons. According to the latest official New START declaration, the United States deploys 1,654 strategic nuclear warheads on 792 deployed intercontinental ballistic missiles, submarine-launched ballistic missiles and strategic bombers. The Federation of American Scientists estimates the United States' non-deployed strategic arsenal is approximately 2,800 warheads, with a tactical nuclear arsenal numbering 500 warheads. An unconfirmed number of additional US warheads are awaiting dismantlement. Russia, meanwhile, is estimated to have approximately 1,480 deployed strategic warheads, with another 1,022 in non-deployed status. It is thought Russia may have several thousand additional warheads awaiting dismantlement. The decision was not met with universal praise however. Hans Kristensen, an arms control expert at the Federation of American Scientists, called the administration's announcement disappointing and a shift away from nuclear weapon reductions. 'This decision appears to have more to do with the administration surrendering to the ICBM caucus [in Congress] than with strategic considerations about national security, he said. The Pentagon said it will cost $19.3million over five years to keep the 50 launch silos and missiles in standby status. The missiles themselves will be stored at the base or, in some cases, sent to a depot for repairs or maintenance. Keeping all 450 silos meant the Pentagon had to make steeper reductions in the Navy's sea-based nuclear force in order to comply with the New START, or Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, by 2018. The US Navy will reduce the number of deployed and non-deployed submarine-launched ballistic nuclear missiles to 280 from the current 336. Decrease: Russia is already is well below the 700-deployed weapon limit and, at the most recent reporting period last October, had only 473 compared to 809 in U.S. hands. Pictured are Russian Topol ICBMs missiles . The Navy has 14 Ohio-class submarines . armed with missiles but only 12 will count as deployed because two will . be undergoing long-term maintenance at a given time during the 10-year . life of the New START treaty. The Navy is embarking on a multibillion-dollar program to build a replacement for the current fleet. The . other 'leg' of the US nuclear force, the Air Force strategic bombers, . will be trimmed from the current deployed total of 93 to 60, with an . additional six available in a non-deployed status. The 60 will comprise 19 B-2 stealth bombers and 41 B-52H Stratofortress heavy bombers. The reductions ensure the US remains within the New START limit of 700 deployed strategic nuclear weapons with 400 ICBMs, 240 sub-launched missiles and 60 bombers. Russia . is already is well below the 700-deployed weapon limit and, at the most . recent reporting period last October, had only 473 compared to 809 in . US hands. The value of the . US keeping the missiles in storage has been questioned, especially . after the Pentagon announced the total cost of the New START changes is . estimated at £300million by 2018. In . addition to the 450 ICBM silos currently in use, the US Air Force has . four at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California that are only used for . test launches. These test silos will remain in place. The 2011 New START Treaty is an agreement between Russia and the US to reduce their nuclear weapons arsenals. It replaced the expiring Treaty of Moscow and required both countries to halve its number of nuclear weapons over the 10 years to 2021. A clause in the agreement means each country must also have a maximum of 700 deployed missiles and bombers, 1,550 deployed warheads and 800 deployed or non-deployed missile launchers by 2018. The New START Treaty replaced the expiring Treaty of Moscow and required both countries to halve the number of nuclear weapons over the 10 years to 2021 . The agreement was controversial from the start, prompting intense public debate during the 2010 US mid-term elections. While arms control experts widely praised the idea of continued nuclear reduction, others accused Russia of 'cheating' on similar past agreements, adding that a further reduction would leave the US vulnerable to attack. 2012 U.S. presidential hopeful Mitt Romney was among those against the Treaty. The allegations of 'cheating' - which were made the Republican Oklahoma Senator James Inhofe during the Senatorial debate - caused outrage in the Russian media. The debate died down somewhat in 2012 when an official Pentagon report into the Treaty was published. The report found that found that even if Russia did 'cheat' on the agreement and attack the US, the Treaty would have 'little to no effect' on US nuclear retaliatory capabilities.","Pentagon says it will keep 450 land-based missiles but put 50 in storage .

"By . Ted Thornhill . Around 50 Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) patrol cars have had their recording devices deliberately disabled, an investigation found. All LAPD police cars are fitted with equipment that automatically records what officers say while outside their vehicles, but antennas for the system in half of the estimated 80 cars in one south LA division were missing, with 10 having been removed in another division. Along with footage shot from an in-car camera - which activates automatically when the emergency lights and siren are switched on - the audio-recording equipment guards against members of the public making false accusations against officers and deters malpractice. Tampering: Small audio transmitters worn by police officers wear on their  belts to allow them to be recorded in the field by their patrol car receiver. They are shown here with broken antennas during a demonstration for media in Los Angeles on Tuesday . An officer’s voice is beamed back to the in-car recording equipment from a transmitter in his or her belt. The removal of the antenna doesn’t necessarily mean the voice cannot be recorded – but it does cut down the range by up to a third, according to LAPD’s expert on the equipment, Sgt. Dan Gomez. What will have caused extra worry to police chiefs is that antennas had been removed from cars that patrol areas of Los Angeles – such as Watts, Jordan Downs and Nickerson Gardens – where community relations with the police are often seriously fractured. Monitoring: All LAPD patrol cars have in-car video equipment, which also records audio from officers when outside the vehicle. Pictured is Los Angeles Police Sgt. Dan Gomez, a department expert on recording devices . Safeguard: Sgt Gomez shows the protected location of an antenna for an audio receiver . Police Commission president Steve Soboroff told The LA Times: ‘This equipment is for the protection of the public and of the officers. To have people who don't like the rules to take it upon themselves to do something like this is very troubling.’ LAPD chiefs were informed that the antennas were being tampered with in the summer of 2013, but did not attempt to track down who was responsible. This was deemed as a futile endeavour as several teams of officers use the same car. Instead warnings were issued and a system put in place that logs the status of the antennas on cars from shift to shift. President Soboroff added: ‘On an issue like this, we need to be brought in right away.’ LAPD Chief Charlie Beck had informed the Police Commission in September that the issue was being dealt with. However, an investigation into a shooting incident in February in which audio recordings of officers at the scene varied hugely in quality indicated that efforts to deal with the problem hadn’t fully succeeded. Concern: Police chiefs noted that antennas had been removed from patrol cars that often visit some of Los Angeles's most deprived areas .","Around 50 LAPD patrol cars have had antennas for recording kit removed .

"By . Ted Thornhill . A Chinese woman has been arrested after she allegedly tried to lop off her son's hand with a meat cleaver during a furious row with her husband at the family home in Shanghai. Mingmei Sun, 34, was annoyed that her husband had not come home earlier to help the boy with his homework, leaving her to do it instead, police said. A furious row erupted that resulted in her husband Tu, 36, walking away and locking himself in the bedroom. Agony: The son was brought screaming into a Shanghai hospital after having three of his fingers chopped off (pictured) - but lucky his father had saved them and surgeons were able to sew them back on . Frustrated and furious that her husband was ignoring her she grabbed eight-year-old Mingming, who had been crying in the corner while his parents argued, and then got a meat cleaver and pulled him into the kitchen. She then put the boy's hand on the kitchen table and allegedly tried to chop it off. However, although she failed to do this, she still left her son in agony as she managed to slice three of his fingers off. Evidence: The cleaver the woman allegedly used to attack her son . Uncertainty: The boy faces a wait before finding out if his injured hand will function properly again . The boy's screams alerted his father, who rushed out and rescued him and took him to the nearest hospital, where doctors on Tuesday were attempting to reattach the fingers. A doctor Mei Ling, 52, said: ‘The child was brought to hospital screaming in pain by his worried father. He had lost a lot of blood, but the father had managed to pick up the three missing fingers and had wrapped them in a tea towel with some ice. ‘Due to the father's quick thinking we were able to take the boy into the operating theatre where we tried to reattach the fingers. Hopefully the boy will make a full recovery but we will not know until a few days after the operation.’ The police said that the wife has been arrested and is currently in custody.","Mingmei Sun attacked her son after rowing with her husband, police said .

"By . Associated Press . A virus never before seen in the U.S. has killed millions of baby pigs in less than a year, and with little known about how it spreads or how to stop it, it's threatening pork production and pushing up prices by 10 percent or more. Scientists think porcine epidemic diarrhea, which does not infect humans or other animals, came from China, but they don't know how it got into the country or spread to 27 states since last May. The federal government is looking into how such viruses might spread, while the pork industry, wary of future outbreaks, has committed $1.7 million to research the disease. Virus: Dr. Craig Rowles stands with hogs in one of his Carroll, Iowa, hog buildings. The farmer did all he could to prevent porcine epidemic diarrhea from spreading to his farm, but the deadly diarrhea attacked in November 2013, killing 13,000 animals in a matter of weeks . Spreading virus: Last summer, the porcine epidemic diarrhea had been found in 16 states, shown in red. It has now spread to some 27 nationwide . The U.S. is both a top producer and . exporter of pork, but production could decline about 7 percent this year . compared to last — the biggest drop in more than 30 years, according to . a recent report from Rabobank, which focuses on the food, beverage and . agribusiness industries. Already, prices have shot up: A pound of . bacon averaged $5.46 in February, 13 percent more than a year ago, . according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Ham and chops have . gone up too, although not as much. Farmer and longtime veterinarian Craig Rowles did all he could to prevent PED from spreading to his farm in Iowa, the nation's top pork producer and the state hardest hit by the disease. He trained workers to spot symptoms, had them shower and change clothing before entering barns and limited deliveries and visitors. Despite his best efforts, the deadly diarrhea attacked in November, killing 13,000 animals in a matter of weeks, most of them less than 2 weeks old. The farm produces about 150,000 pigs each year. Deadly: PED, a virus never before seen in the U.S. has killed millions of pigs in less than a year, and with little known about how it spreads or how to stop it, it¿s threatening pork production and pushing up prices by 10 percent or more . Pigging out: The virus as seen under the electron microscope . Estimates of how many pigs have died in the past year vary, ranging from at least 2.7 million to more than 6 million. The U.S. Department of Agriculture says the die-off has had a hand in shrinking the nation's pig herd by 3 percent to about 63 million pigs. Diarrhea affects pigs like people: Symptoms that are uncomfortable in adults become life-threatening in newborns that dehydrate quickly. The best chance at saving young pigs is to wean them and then pump them with clear fluids that hydrate them without taxing their intestines. But nothing could be done for the youngest ones except euthanasia. ""It's very difficult for the people who are working the barns at that point,"" Rowles said. ""... No one wants to go to work today and think about making the decision of baby pigs that need to be humanely euthanized because they can't get up anymore. Those are very hard days."" PED thrives in cold weather, so the death toll in the U.S. has soared since December. No cure: Bacon prices are rising as a virus sweeps though the Unites States, killing baby pigs. The Associated Press reported that the Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Virus, which has never been seen in the United States, has already killed millions of pigs in twenty seven states . The first reports came from the Midwest, and the states most affected are those with the largest share of the nation's pigs: Iowa, Minnesota, North Carolina and Illinois. The disease also has spread to Canada and Mexico. Some states now require a veterinarian to certify that pigs coming in are virus-free, while China, which has seen repeated outbreaks since the 1980s, has asked the U.S. Department of Agriculture to similarly vouch for animals shipped overseas. Companies are racing to develop a vaccine, but the federal government has yet to approve one.  While the mass deaths have been a blow for farmers, the financial impact to them may be limited because pork prices are rising to make up for the loss of animals. It takes about six months for a hog to reach market weight so the supply will be short for a while. Smithfield Foods, one of the nation's largest pork processors, has cut some plant shifts to four days per week in North Carolina, and those in the Midwest are likely to do so later this spring, said Steve Meyer, an Iowa-based economist and pork industry consultant. Smithfield Foods declined to comment. Piggy in the middle: Farmers are desperately attempting to take measures to curtail the epidemic, ranging from basic hygiene to euthanasia of livestock . In the end, consumers will be most affected, Meyer said, with pork prices likely to be 10 percent higher overall this summer than a year ago. ""We're all used to: 'We've got plenty of food, it's cheap. We'll eat what we want to,'"" Meyer said. ""We Americans are very spoiled by that, but this is one of those times that we're going to find out that when one of these things hits, it costs us a lot of money.""

Sadly, his beloved goldfish has since died. But the fish lived to the grand old age of 11 thanks, Mr Warren-Madden says, to his adventurous lifestyle - which included trips to the pub and walks around town. Despite Malcolm passing away he hopes his pioneering legacy will now see an entrepreneur come forward to invest in the invention. Mr Warren-Madden, from Holmfirth, West Yorkshire, said: 'We had some right looks around town, we stopped traffic, but everyone has got into it now. It's not every day you see someone taking a fish for a walk. 'If a fish is in a bowl on a shelf swimming in circles it must get bored. I decided it would be fun to take it out with me down the pub. 'People have said to me the fish couldn't see what was going on, but I always said ""how do you know?""' Mr Warren-Madden, from Holmfirth, West Yorkshire, said: 'We had some right looks around town, we stopped traffic, but everyone has got into it now. It's not every day you see someone taking a fish for a walk' The contraption even allows fish owners to share a drink at the local with their pet, as Mr Warren-Madden enjoyed to do with the late Malcolm . He said: 'If a fish is in a bowl on a shelf swimming in circles it must get bored. I decided it would be fun to take it out with me down the pub' 'Malcolm lived to almost 12-years-old, I think he was getting something out of it.' The Aquatic Perambulator - which is now a Mark III - stands around four-foot tall and is made from laser-cut mild steel. Mr Warren-Madden, who lives with wife Shirley, 58, said: 'My wife has learned to live with me, I have been tinkering around with this idea for around seven years. 'With the first designs I didn't take into account how heavy water is so I have modified it over the years. 'I've added better elastic to take the shock out of the water and I hope to get better wheels. 'Because of my background as a sheet metal worker I have been able to build this at little cost - but for someone else it would cost hundreds to make. 'I think I'd like someone to come forward and help me motorise it perhaps with a remote control.'","Mike Warren-Madden spent weeks designing 'Aquatic Perambulator'

"By . Daniel Miller . A cat from the Canary Islands has mysteriously turned up 2,000 miles away in a Scottish fishing village leaving locals utterly baffled as to how she got there. The wandering moggy, who has been nicknamed Juanita , was found cowering in a garage in the village of Muchalls, Aberdeenshire, on Thursday morning. Rosy Long, 66, found the distressed tabby while putting her car away after a day trip with her husband William. Littlest hobo: But just how did Juanita, pictured with her finder Rosy Long, make it from the Canary Islands to a Scottish fishing village in Aberdeenshire? They assumed she was a neighbours and took her to the vets to have her ID chip scanned - where they found out she had been registered  on the sunshine island of Fuerteventura. Rosy explained: 'We imagined if she had a microchip then we would maybe find an address in Muchalls and we could take her back to her owners. 'But when we scanned her it was the Canary Islands - we couldn’t quite believe it. 'The cat is so young - under a year old. For someone to have brought her over from the Canary Islands they must have paid a fair bit. 'It just seems a total mystery.' Mystery: A microchip scan revealed the young female tabby had been registered on the sunshine island of Fuerteventura . The cat’s ID chip was tracked down to the Spanish database - but with no information how she had made the 2,000 mile trip . William had been up at 6am on Thursday morning to get the car out of the garage up the road from their house. BY AIR - With Ryan Air operating flights between Fuerteventura and Manchester, it is conceivable that Juanita could have stowed away on board a plane before making the final leg to Aberdeenshire on foot. But at around four kilos in weight it is unlikely she would have got past the airline's check-in staff without being asked to pay a hefty surcharge. BY LAND - Passenger ferries regularly run between the island and mainland Spain. Could the adventurous puss have smuggled herself into the back of a car or lorry and hitch-hiked her way through France before joining other migrants in Sangatte and slipping past Britain's border controls? BY SEA - Attracted by the smell of fresh sardines, Juanita may have sauntered aboard a Spanish fishing vessel setting off on a trip to UK waters before docking at the fishing village of Muchalls to stock up on oatcakes. Rosy reckoned that the cat had chased her husband inside looking for human contact as there was no-one else around at that time in the morning. She said: 'The poor little thing had presumably ran into the garage at 6am when we took the car out in the morning. 'She seemed frantic. We let her out and put her in our back garden. 'She’s just a young thing - not the kind of cat you would just leave. She just seemed lost and kept coming back to us.' Cat-loving Rosy and her husband spent the day knocking on doors in the fishing village looking for the owners or anyone who knew whose cat it was - but with no luck. They eventually took her to the vets in the nearby town of Stonehaven where they made the shock discovery that she had been chipped in the Spanish island chain. At first the vets checked the local database to see if the cat had been registered in Aberdeenshire. When the search drew a blank they searched the UK database - which also came back with no results. Eventually the cat’s ID chip was tracked down to the Spanish database - but with no information how she had made the 2,000 mile trip.

"By . Anna Edwards . and Arthur Martin . Travis claims he is the victim of a 'witchhunt' and that he was 'mad as hell about the allegations' Dave Lee Travis told a court yesterday he had been groped by three famous women – but refused to divulge their names. The former BBC Radio 1 DJ said they ‘put their hands down my legs and squeezed me’. Travis told Southwark Crown Court it was a ‘different world’ back in the 1970s, when some of his alleged sex offences are said to have taken place. He said ‘things that happened ... was just flirtatious behaviour’. The 68-year-old also claimed that half of the country would be in jail by now ‘if patting somebody’s bottom in the 1970s was a crime’. Back then, ‘you could put your arm around someone’s waist and it wasn’t misread as an attack’ and ‘you could touch someone on their shoulder and you wouldn’t get arrested for it’. The DJ told the court: ‘Put any person on the stand and ask them about those days and they will say it was flirtatious. I could give you names of four women, three of whom are very famous, who have groped me – and I mean groped me. ‘I don’t mean touch my back or bottom, but they have put their hands down my legs and squeezed me. ‘Do you want their names? I’m not going to give them to you. But it happened.’ The former BBC presenter, known as DLT, . denies indecently assaulting 10 women and sexually assaulting another. The DJ did concede he was ‘no angel’ when questioned about ‘falling into temptation’. During heated cross-examination on his third day in the witness box, he said the allegations against him were simply part of a ‘witch hunt’ which made him ‘as mad as hell’. Wearing a dark suit and lilac shirt, he became visibly agitated when cross examined by the QC, who suggested he was ‘a liar’. ‘Oh my god!’ He exclaimed. ‘I . understand it’s your job to belittle me and tell the jury what a . terrible person I am, but I will not stand for that.’ The former presenter insisted he had ‘nothing to apologise for’ and had done ‘nothing to warrant his trial’. ‘I have no idea why they (the alleged victims) came forward now’, he added.

Miranda Moore QC asked: ‘Were you mad as hell because you were doing . this sort of thing for years and years, thinking that it was perfectly . all right, when it fact it wasn’t?’ Travis replied: ‘No, that is absolutely 100 per cent wrong.’ Ms Moore asked him: ‘Why are you . finding it so incredulous these women are coming forward to give . evidence for example, about you squeezing their bottom?’ ‘I’m incredulous because it didn’t happen’, the DJ replied.

But he conceded: ‘I never said I was a sex symbol. I’m a big cuddly hairy bear.’ Video . footage of him attending the launch of a hospital radio station with . his wife Marianne in Hertfordshire in 1973 was played to the court. Travis is accused of molesting a 17-year-old carnival princess as he walked around the hospital wards. The footage shows him posing for pictures with his arms around two carnival princesses. Travis allegedly touched the young woman’s breasts and groped her thighs when they were alone in a darkened corridor. She tearfully told how she had . suffered ‘40 years of hell’ at the hands of the Radio 1 DJ, adding her . sex life with her late husband had been destroyed. But . he suggested that he was ‘too important’ and would not have been left . alone at any time, adding that the woman could be a ‘fantasist’. He then holds the one he is accused of molesting in his arms and appears to say ‘I’ve pulled’. Travis claimed he said ‘mad fool’. He said if he wanted to act inappropriately, he would have ‘left his wife in the car’, jurors heard. Asked if he had indecently assaulted her, the DJ said the allegation was ‘complete nonsense’. When asked by his counsel, Stephen Vullo, . for his version of events, DLT said: ‘All I can say is, no, it didn’t . happen, I was never alone with this woman, people were there from start . to finish and my wife was there, for God’s sake. 'It just didn’t happen.’ Responding to a question by . Ms Moore about why didn’t he simply shake the girl’s hand, he said: . ‘I’m not an accountant, it’s meant to be a fun business, it’s meant to . be show business.’ Asked if his wife would give evidence about the hospital radio incident he said ‘Not if I can help it’ ‘She has suffered enough without having to go through all this melee.’ Travis allegedly molested 10 women and a 15-year-old girl between 1976 and 2008.

Now, seven years on, he is joining his older sister Bindi, 15, in their bids to become the next 'wildlife warriors'. Celebration: Robert Irwin marked his tenth birthday by feeding fish to salt water crocodiles in Australia Zoo . Flashback: Steve Irwin holds Robert - just a month old in this picture - in one arm as he feeds a 13 foot crocodile in January 2004 . Celebrating his tenth birthday in Australia Zoo, he marked the occasion by feeding his first ever saltwater crocodile. It is a step up from handing fresh fish to more mild water crocodiles. Flanked . by his mother, Terri, sister, and friends, the young Irwin thanked . onlookers for their support after completing the challenge. There was even a Father Christmas there to complete the festive occasion. Robert was guided by zookeepers as he entered the pen to face the giant tetrapod. Ecstatic: His mother Terri embraced him as sister Bindi, 15, gave him a birthday message . Warm up: He started by feeding a water crocodile at the festive event put on for his birthday . Step up: It was then to tackle the more dangerous, bigger and menacing salt water crocodile . Advice: He was guided by a keeper at the zoo, who helped him gauge how to get around the giant tetrapod . Warming up by feeding a small water crocodile, he then darted and crouched around the park clutching fish as he gauged the best way to approach its larger, more aggressive cousin. When it came to throwing the food, he spun it with confidence inches in front of the crocodile, which took it and scarpered. His family rushed forwards to give him a hug as the crowd cheered. As a baby, his father was pictured feeding a crocodile while holding him in the other arm. Tactics: With fish in hand, the pair darted around the pen to get in the right position for the difficult task . The moment: When it came to throwing the fish, Robert did it artfully and landed the food inches in front . Success: Delighted, Robert shared a joke with another conservationist before thanking onlookers for support . Family: The trio, determined to continue Steve's legacy, spoke to fans after the event and beamed at cameras . At the time the pictures caused worldwide controversy from people who were shocked that a baby so young had been put in such close proximity to a dangerous animal. But it seems as young Robert has grown up around the creatures, he has developed little fear for them. Steve was killed in September 2006 after getting stung by a stingray while filming in Australia's Great Barrier Reef. He was setting up to shoot ocean reef footage at the time for a show that would include segments with his daughter Bindi. The Irwin family have always vowed to carry on Steve's work. At the age of 12, Bindi was promoting a new line of books in her Wildlife Adventures series. Last month, she opened up about her father, the 'wildlife warrior', saying: 'He was the greatest dad on the planet.' Attributing . his success to his genuine and unrivalled love for the animals he . worked with, Bindi said her father has inspired her and Robert to . dedicate their lives to nuturing zoo animals. Emerging: In July, Bindi celebrated her 15th birthday by paving the way to a career in wildlife conservation . Then: Robert was just three, and Bindi was eight, when their father Steve was killed by a stingray .","Robert Irwin spent his 10th birthday feeding his first salt water crocodile .

"By . Will Payne . Spoiled teen Rachel Canning may have abandoned her controversial legal battle to sue her parents, but she has not given up on her party lifestyle - or the boyfriend her mom and dad banned her from seeing. The cheerleader – who made international headlines after she took her parents to court to accuse them of abandoning her – posted a string of pictures on her public Facebook page last week showing her at a wild high school blowout. In some of the snaps - contained in an album called, 'Seniors' - Rachel, 18, is seen clutching a plastic cup and in one ‘action shot’ she is shown taking a huge swig. Scroll down for video . Wild: Rachel posted pictures of herself at the high school party just weeks after it emerged she moved back in to the home of her parents she sued for abandoning her. She had refused to live by their rules which they drew up in response to concerns she was drinking too much . Smooch: Canning, 18, was pictured in high spirits and kissing boys at the raucous event. She was no doubt celebrating the fact that she had secured a $56,000 scholarship to college . Banned: Boyfriend Lucas Kitzmiller, far left, was also at the party. Rachel launched the legal action against her parents when they said she could not go out with him if she wanted to live at home . The teen is pictured with a number of different boys – planting a kiss on one – but more importantly her boyfriend Lucas Kitzmiller features in one of the images. Rachel’s parents Sean and Elizabeth - who have easy access to the snaps - expressly banned her from seeing Lucas, 18, after they accused him of leading their daughter astray and making her, ‘obsessed with drinking every weekend’. In fact her drinking and her relationship with Lucas were the main reasons for the explosive fall out experienced by the Cannings. Last November, soon after moving out of the family home in Lincoln Park, New Jersey, Rachel sent her father an email saying she was ready to come back. Sean, a former police chief, responded, writing: ‘As far as the boyfriend, yeah, you might not agree and sure you don't but that has been as much a drag on you as anything, if you're home he's not around or involved in your life.' Furious Rachel responded 'Well I'm not coming home if I can't see him'. That was their last correspondence until they met in Morris County Court on March 5. Between those dates Rachel lived at the home of her best friend’s father, John Inglesino, a high powered lawyer who actually funded her legal battle. In the lawsuit, Sean and Elizabeth were accused of abandoning their daughter and told they needed to pay for her private school tuition, her university fees and her legal bills. School run: Rachel was pictured being seen off to school by her mother Elizabeth just days after a judge shared his very dim view of her lawsuit . Back home: Rachel's parents have welcomed her back to their Lincoln Park, New Jersey home, pictured. But it was assumed she would then have to tow the line . Their counter argument centered on Rachel’s drinking and her relationship with Lucas. In incendiary court papers, Elizabeth laid into her daughter, Lucas and even his parents. She wrote: ‘Prior her dating him, Rachel had been dating another boy through the summer of 2013 where they rarely, if ever engaged in the heavy partying that was being exhibited nonstop in the fall of 2013. ‘She (Rachel) was routinely bought home drunk by the Kitzmillers, well past her curfew… . ‘In ignoring our very lenient rules and curfews, it became the normal fashion on weekends for Lucas’ father or mother to drive Lucas and Rachel home from whatever party they were able to find around the country.’ Referencing one particular incident, she said: ‘On that particular night Lucas’ father drove her home drunk and dropped her off at our home at 3.30am.’ Lucas also faced the brunt of the Canning family anger when it came to her disciplinary problems at school. Elizabeth said he was present when Rachel was suspended from Morris Catholic High School, explaining: ‘Upon Rachel’s return to school (following a first suspension) she cut school with Lucas Kitzmiller and called into school herself purporting to be me. ‘On October 29, 2014 the night before she left, we had told her she could no longer see her boyfriend due to the suspension and his poor influence on her and we took away her phone and car privileges. Down the hatch: Rachel was pictured with blurry-eyed friends downing from a plastic cup . Worse for wear: Rachel posted a picture of this boy who looked as if he passed out drunk in the yard . ‘Upon suspension, she attended work with her father… Despite our having imposed a punishment for the suspension she was picked up by her unsupervised and also suspended boyfriend, Lucas Kitzmiller… within an hour of arriving there…. She went to the Kitzmiller’s home. ‘Mrs Kitzmiller contacted me at work stating that she had both Rachel and her son, Lucas, at her house and that for the sake of our children, that I needed to contact Morris Catholic and tell them that Rachel had my permission to be at her house. ‘I vociferously refused to comply with this and indicated to Mrs. Kitzmiller that they needed to be accountable for their actions… . ‘I was attempting to exert moral legal parental authority over daughter despite the enabling and parental interfering behavior of Mrs. Kitzmiller, which undermined our parenting and rules.’ Those statements led to a war of words between the Cannings and the Kitzmillers. Speaking to MailOnline last month Lucas’ dad Jeffery said: ‘My son has been painted in a questionable light by some of the comments from the Cannings. 'Their only experience of him is that he met the father long enough to shake hands. That's the only interaction they have ever had. They made their decision about him from that. 'If you read the court papers you can see the trend is with every boyfriend she's had it's always the boyfriend who's the bad influence. We have been dragged into this.’ But it seems that bad blood has not changed Rachel and Lucas' feeling towards each other. Following months of recriminations the case went to court and Judge Peter Bogaard made it immediately clear that he was not sympathetic to Rachel’s arguments. After reading an expletive-laden and vicious answerphone message left by Rachel Canning to Elizabeth, in which the girl said: 'I wanna s*** all over your face', he said: 'Have you ever in your experience seen such gross disrespect for a parent? I don’t see it in my house.’ The judge added that Rachel had given her mom and dad: ‘The proverbial f you’. He also warned he must consider the 'slippery slope' where 'we open the gates for a 12-year-old to sue for an Xbox, a 13-year-old to sue for an iPhone… what about a 15-year-old asking for a 60 inch TV?' Seemingly realizing she was fighting a losing battle Rachel agreed to move back into her parents’ house the following week and dropped the lawsuit. Holding it together: Rachel didn't look in such a bad state compared to those she was partying with . Disrespect: The judge overseeing the case asked: 'Have you ever seen such gross disrespect for a parent? I don’t see it in my house' after he read a foul answerphone message Rachel had left her mother . But if her Facebook pictures are anything to go by she has not changed her lifestyle and is still hanging out with Lucas, something which is sure to anger her parents. On top of that it seems she has also got her parents to agree to part-fund her college education, the main reason for launching the lawsuit. Rachel announced on her Facebook page in a public post on March 29 that she plans to attend Western New England University as a biomedical engineering major on a $56,000 scholarship. She wrote: ‘Decision made. WNE U class of 2018 BME Major w/ 56,000$ scholarship.’ A Western New England spokesman confirmed to the Daily Record that Canning was accepted into the private school in Massachusetts. In an email to USA Today, they added: ‘Western New England University routinely offers merit scholarships to incoming freshmen based on academic achievement. ... These merit scholarships can total between $22,000 and $66,000 over the course of four years.’ One year of tuition at the school for an undergraduate engineering student is $32,606, and room and board is an additional $12,700, according to the university website.","Rachel, 18, posted a string of pictures on Facebook last week at her wild high school blow out .

"By . Emma Glanfield . A former Wickes cashier who became a Nigerian state governor and defrauded £157million of public funds to live a lavish lifestyle may not have to pay a single penny back. James Ibori, 51, is said to have personally pocketed £50million of cash stolen from the west African nation’s oil-rich Delta State during his eight-year tenure. The former £5,000-a-year Wickes cashier blew millions on luxury homes, a £12.6million private jet, fees at some of the UK’s most expensive boarding schools for his children, first-class travel and exclusive hotels. James Ibori, 51, of Hampstead, London,  is said to have personally pocketed £50million of cash stolen from the west African nation's oil-rich Delta State during his eight-year tenure . The former Wickes cashier blew millions on luxury homes, a £12.6million private jet, fees at some of the UK's most expensive boarding schools for his children and exclusive hotels . He owned a £600,000 fleet of armoured Range Rovers, a £120,000 Bentley and a £340,000 Mercedes Maybach that was shipped direct to his £3.2million mansion in Johannesburg. Described as one of Nigeria’s most influential and wealthy politicians, Ibori rigged lucrative state contracts with the help of his wife, mistress, sister, and an inner circle of corrupt officials and lifted money straight out of state funds. He also sold £23million of state-owned shares in telecoms company Vee Mobile to fund a lavish lifestyle, including £125,000 monthly credit card bills while his people languished in poverty. Ibori, who now lives in Hampstead, north west London, was sentenced to 13 years behind bars in April 2012 after admitting a raft of fraud and money laundering offences. He is due to face a confiscation hearing at Southwark Crown Court but it was claimed today that he did not make a single penny from the £157million fraud. Applying to have confiscation proceedings thrown out, Ivan Krolick, defending, said Ibori’s pleas of guilt were not an admission that he personally profited from the scam. Ibori owned a £120,000 Bentley, a £340,000 Mercedes Maybach that was shipped direct to his £3.2million mansion in Johannesburg and a range of homes including one in Dorset, pictured . The former £5,000-a-year Wickes cashier owned a £600,000 fleet of armoured Range Rovers and sold £23million of state-owned shares to fund a lavish lifestyle, including £125,000 monthly credit card bills . The court heard if the full confiscation hearing does go ahead under the Proceeds of Crime Act, the fraudster may only be ordered to pay back £330,000. Prosecutor Sasha Wass QC said: ‘The handling of the money itself gave rise to the crime so the benefit of the crime in the context of this case would be the same thing. ‘It gives rise to the proceeds of crime. ‘The Crown has been taken wholly by surprise that Mr Krolick should address the court and say that there was no evidence in effect that Mr Ibori benefited’. Nigerian-born Ibori moved to the UK in the 1980s where he married his wife, Theresa, and worked as a cashier at Wickes in Ruislip, Middlesex. In 1990 the pair were convicted of stealing goods from the store and fined £300. A year later Ibori was fined £100 for handling a stolen credit card before he moved back to his homeland.Ibori was elected as governor of Delta State in 1999 after tricking his way into power by hiding details of his previous convictions in the UK for theft and changing his age. In 2003, he was re-elected as governor for another four year term, after failing to disclose his previous convictions and financial status. Ibori, 51, who now lives in Hampstead, north west London, pictured, was previously convicted of stealing goods from hope improvement store Wickes and handling a stolen credit card . Ibori, described as one of Nigeria's most influential and wealthy politicians, bought a £120,000 Bentley, pictured, a £340,000 Mercedes Maybach and a £600,000 fleet of armoured Range Rovers . During that time he systematically stole funds from the public purse, secreting them in bank accounts across the world. His methods included the inflation of State contracts, kickbacks and the transfer of cash from the State accounts by unscrupulous employees in his inner circle. In one instance he rigged the tendering process for state contracts in cahoots with his mistress Udoumaka Okoronkwo, who would be due to face confiscation proceedings alongside Ibori. The couple used Okoronkwo’s companies Sagicon, Rivbbed and Saagaris - the latter of which their four-month old love-child was named as a director of - to ‘bid’ for inflated deals to provide items to the state including china and vehicles. The money was then channelled out of Nigeria before it was laundered through a series of off-shore trusts and companies. Ibori was also helped to steal the cash by his wife Theresa, sister Christine Ibori-Ibie, and a series of corrupt professionals - UK London based lawyer, Bhadresh Gohil, fiduciary agent Daniel Benedict McCann and corporate financier, Lambertus De Boer. Ibori was also helped to steal the cash by his sister Christine Ibori-Ibie, whose plush home is pictured above, wife Theresa and a series of corrupt professionals including London based lawyer Bhadresh Gohil . The former state governor was arrested by officers from the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) in Nigeria in December 2007. Two years later at a court in Ibori’s hometown in Asaba, 170 charges of corruption were dismissed on the basis that there was no clear evidence to convict. The case was reopened in April 2010 by the EFCC before Ibori fled to Dubai. He was finally extradited back to the UK in April 2011. Ibori admitted ten offences relating to conspiracy to launder funds from Delta State, substantive counts of money laundering and one count of obtaining a money transfer by deception and fraud. He was excused from attending today’s hearing and Judge Anthony Pitts is expected to rule on Friday whether he will face a full confiscation hearing.","James Ibori defrauded £157m from west African nation's oil rich Delta State .

"By . Leon Watson . Big Issue bosses claimed today its magazine sellers are being muscled out of their pitches by aggressive beggars making £400 a day. The charity, which offers people who are homeless the opportunity to earn their own money, said beggars in Birmingham are pocketing £2,800 per week, then spending it on drink and drugs. Becky Mitchell, manager of the magazine's West Midlands base, said the amount was revealed to her by one of her 25-strong band of Big Issue sellers. The Big Issue offers people who are homeless the opportunity to earn their own money. It was founded by John Bird and Gordon Roddick in September 1991. The Big Issue says legitimate sellers make around £35 a week in Birmingham (stock picture) Ms Mitchell added: 'What they do is illegal. A beggar who is constantly in the public's face can earn a lot more money.' Big Issue sales support manager Freddie Barrett added: 'The money beggars earn is not saved. There isn't anything left by the end of the week - it all goes on things like drink and drugs.' The pair also accused the culprits of depriving legitimate Big Issue sellers of their meagre £35-a-day income. Ms Barrett added: 'Our vendors can get bullied for their magazines, but we work closely with West Midlands Police and street wardens. 'People make a judgement. It's schoolboy bullying. No one wants to be bottom of the heap, so they pick on people they think are. 'They are constantly told to get a job, but they have a job - a really hard job. These are people on the way up, people who are ready for a change. The homeless charity says its sellers are being muscled off their pitches by bullying beggars (stock picture) 'Everyone who walks through our door is a success because they are ready to stand on their own two feet.' Big Issue sellers pay £1.25 for each copy - which they sell for £2.50 - and have to buy their own red tabard for £15. One Big Issue seller - who fled his home in Kenilworth, Warkwickshire, because of bullying - told how he was spat at less than a month ago. Ollie Bain, 34, said: 'Three weeks ago a girl spat in my face and I've had people telling me they'll smash my face in. 'I'm constantly told to get a job. I don't know what they think I'm doing. We are not scrounging, we are working for our money. 'People don't realise how lucky they are. They have a roof over their head, but some people need a little help.' Last year two Big Issue sellers Ian Watson-Gladwish, 31, and Wayne Busst, 32, were stabbed to death in Union Street in Birmingham. Paranoid schizophrenic John Ward, 24, admitted manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility and was detained for life with a minimum of 12 years behind bars.","Homeless charity says its sellers are being muscled off their pitches .

"By . Amanda Platell . Before her devastating descent into drug and alcohol abuse, Paula Yates’s abiding concern was to be a good mother to her four young children. In fact, the row that led up to the death of her partner, Michael Hutchence, was about her kids. She wanted to take them to Australia to spend time as a family at Christmas. Her estranged husband, Bob Geldof, was having none of it, rightly concerned about Hutchence’s wild sex, drugs and rock ’n’ roll lifestyle. Hutchence hanged himself and, in despair, Paula spiralled out of control, dying from a heroin overdose three years later, when Peaches was just 11. Dedicated: Before her devastating descent into drug and alcohol abuse, Paula Yates's abiding concern was to be a good mother to her four young children. Above, Paula is pictured with her daughter, Peaches Geldof . One can only imagine how terrible those years must have been for her children, as their mother battled her addictions and her grief, even clutching her dead lover’s ashes in a pillow to her breast each night. As Peaches would later recall: ‘My mother, who was amazing, who wrote books on parenting, who gave us this idyllic childhood in Kent . . . turned into this heartbroken shell of a woman who was just medicating to get through the day.’ Small wonder that Peaches said she could never get over her mother’s death. Even after the birth of her own two beautiful boys — Astala, almost two, and Phaedra, 11 months — the absence of her mother left a gaping hole in her life. Fast forward 14 years and, with unbearable poignancy, her children will now inherit that same legacy of sorrow. For it is perhaps the greatest tragedy of Peaches’s sudden death that it has condemned her sons to grow up without a mother’s love, just as she was obliged to herself. Life of sorrow: Even after Peaches had her own two beautiful boys - Astala (right), almost two, and Phaedra (left), 11 months - the absence of her mother left a gaping hole in her life. She never got over her mother's death . Whatever the cause of her death, that is surely the last thing Peaches would have wanted. For while she had undoubtedly made many mistakes in her life, the former wild child had finally left her rock ’n’ roll lifestyle behind to concentrate on being the best mother she could be. She was happily married and had set up a country idyll for her children, posting pictures of them with the family dog, eating mashed potato, larking around, and doing all the things toddlers do. She had even started writing for Mother & Baby magazine, just as Paula had written books about the joy of being a stay-at-home mum in the years before she met Hutchence. Happier times: Fast forward 14 years and, with unbearable poignancy, Peaches's children will now inherit that same legacy of sorrow. Above, the model and journalist is pictured with her sons and husband, Thomas Cohen . One of the last images Peaches posted on Twitter was of her boys’ Easter display, with homemade cards, daffodils, and chocolate eggs that now will never be eaten. Yet, in a curious way, Peaches’s life mirrored her mother’s in reverse. While Paula was the doting mother who only descended into drug abuse in later life, Peaches was immersed in that world from a terrifyingly young age. In 2008, aged 19, she was filmed buying drugs from a dealer in a seedy East London flat. Later that year, Peaches stopped breathing for several minutes after a suspected heroin overdose. She refused to go to hospital in case her father found out. Former couple: Paula Yates is pictured with her ex-partner, Michael Hutchence, who later hanged himself . Happy family: Paula is seen here with her ex-husband Sir Bob Geldof and three children at EuroDisney in 1992 . She dismissed it as ‘a bad experience’ and ‘something people go through, especially growing up in London’. She told one interviewer: ‘You have to live on the edge as the edge is where you find out who you are.’ One of her lovers even blogged about their sex sessions, enhanced by injecting ‘lemon heroin’ and, in 2011, there were pictures of her in a five-in-a-bed sex session. Again, she collapsed, this time in her North London home, in ‘respiratory arrest’. Changed woman: After having a family and moving to the country, Peaches grew up at last . That all changed when she married Tom Cohen, had a family and moved to the country. Peaches, by all accounts, had grown up at last, becoming a contented, considerate young woman. But who knows what deadly toll the years of abuse took on her young body. Recently, she appeared painfully and dangerously thin, thanks to the juice-only diets that helped her lose weight. Being a new mum can be draining for a young woman at the best of times — all the more so without her own mother on hand to lend advice and support — and Peaches increasingly sought friendship from her 200,000 Twitter followers, with whom she discussed exhaustion, her baby’s teething troubles and her domestic struggles. Ultimately, though, the platitudes and vacuities of the Twittersphere are no substitute for true support in life any more than they are in death, as strangers and hangers-on now rush to tweet their personal devastation. Sharon Osbourne, Alan Sugar, Boris Becker, Phillip Schofield, Coleen Rooney, Myleene Klass, Alexandra Burke — they were all at it on Monday, in a predictable show of public mourning. How much more meaningful if they’d sent a private letter to her father or husband, rather than a shallow, self-aggrandising tweet, wallowing in the wave of collective hysteria. It wasn’t the approval of strangers that Peaches needed, it was a mother’s unconditional love. A love that she pledged she would give to her own children for ever. As she wrote for Baby & Mother a month ago: ‘After years of struggling to know myself, lost at sea, rudderless and troubled . . . I felt finally anchored in place, with lives that literally depend on me, and I am not about to let them down, not for anyone or anything.’ One can only hope it will be some solace for those two baby boys as they grow up to know that, unlike their grandmother Paula, Peaches seemed to have left her dark days behind her and was focused on giving them the love and stability of ‘a mummy and daddy together for ever’. If only.","Before descent into drug abuse, Paula Yates aspired to be good mother .

"By . Mark Duell . Retired weaver: Rosemary Carr suffered multiple injuries after leaping from a bridge in Lancashire . An 80-year-old retired weaver with memory loss jumped to her death from a motorway bridge, fearing she was ‘becoming a burden’ to her husband, an inquest has heard. Rosemary Carr, who was a keen walk leader, suffered multiple injuries after leaping from an M65 bridge in Nelson, Lancashire. But her husband Harry told the hearing that he ‘would have put up with her forever’. Mrs Carr left him a note, asking ‘for forgiveness’. She suffered from memory problems but had otherwise been a ‘fit and well woman’. Mr Carr, of Barrowford, Lancashire, said his wife’s memory had worsened in the last year. He added: ‘Her memory was a lot worse than anyone really knew. The doctor said she thought she was becoming a burden on me. She wasn’t. I would have put up with her forever.’ Mr Carr said that on the night before his wife’s death, they had stayed up late to watch a film, but that when he woke up the next morning she was gone and had left him a note downstairs. PC Neil Goodison, from Lancashire’s road policing unit in Colne, said he spotted Mrs Carr at the bridge during a routine patrol at around 8.10am on November 8 last year. He said: ‘She rolled herself over the barrier so she was on the wrong side. I instantly put my flashing lights on and my colleague jumped out and stopped the traffic. ‘As soon as I have done that I have looked forward, saw a pair of legs underneath the bridge, and this person - I’m sorry to say it - dropped from the bridge like a rag doll and landed in the motorway.’ A post-mortem examination by pathologist Dr Walid Salman found that Mrs Carr’s medical cause of death was ‘multiple severe injuries’. Reaching a conclusion that she had taken her own life, East Lancashire coroner Richard Taylor said to Mr Carr: ‘Your wife must have been under the misapprehension that she was a burden on you. ‘She must have been very worried herself, because she recognised that her memory wasn’t what it was and that tended to embarrass her, and it’s in that frame of mind she decided to end her life. ‘She wrote the note and it’s quite clear what her intentions were from that note. People did what they could to help her but that was to no avail. She simply took her own life.’","Rosemary Carr suffered multiple injuries after leaping from an M65 bridge .

"By . Rebecca English In Wellington . and Catherine Ostler . Despite wearing a noticeably longer Catherine Walker coat and dress on her arrival in Australia, the Duchess of Cambridge still managed to be caught out by a gust of windy weather. Although the outfit’s hemline was around three inches lower than normal, it seemed Kate still hasn’t picked up on the Queen’s trick of sewing lead curtain weights into her outfits. No sooner had Kate stepped off the plane than she managed to flash a length of shapely thigh. Marilyn moment: The Duchess Of Cambridge nearly suffered a wardrobe malfunction as she touched down in Wellington, New Zealand on Monday with Prince William and baby George . Kate, pictured here in Canada in 2011, has had trouble with the wind before as she favours shorter dresses . Walker, a great favourite of the late Diana, Princess of Wales, designed the scarlet coat with two rows of pearlised buttons especially for Kate’s first formal appearance on tour. The eye-catching colour and striking style ensured that Kate stood out on a grey and blustery day in Wellington. It was also the perfect foil for her son’s all-cream and white ensemble. The Duchess clearly continues to be strongly influenced by Diana. The outfit was almost identical to the red skirt suit Diana wore in October 1989 to visit RAF Wittering -  from the vivid shade right down to the the buttons, pointy collar and sharp shoulders. At the height of her fame, the reticent, late Chelsea-based couturier Catherine Walker was synonymous with Diana’s glamorous dresses. She made over 1,000 outfits for her Royal client; the first three months after her wedding to Charles and the last a little black dress ordered a few weeks before she died; Diana was buried in it. Some of them – such as the white ‘Elvis’ dress, pearl-studded with a bolero jacket – were among Diana’s most memorable and showstopping looks. Kate has become the darling of the world's media in much the same way as Princess Diana did, and echoes her chic style 30 years later in a very similar outfit. She was wearing Catherine Walker, favoured by Diana . Late Chelsea-based couturier Catherine Walker was synonymous with Diana’s glamorous dresses, including these piece. She made over 1,000 outfits for her Royal client, even the little black dress she was buried in . She wore a Walker smock to leave hospital with baby Prince William, and Walker gowns – one white silk, another with a black halter neck - when she was photographed by Mario Testino for Vanity Fair in 1997. Walker’s particular talent - and one which will appeal to Kate as much as it did Diana - was for making outfits that showed off the woman rather than the frock. They were dignifed yet - particularly post Charles and Diana’s divorce - more than a little daring. Her clothes are statements of style rather than fashion, and the fabric and cut are always perfect. So it shouldn’t have been that much of a surprise when Carole Middleton chose the fashion house, run since Catherine’s  death in 2010 by her second husband and business partner, Sayeed Ismail, to make her triumphant pale blue coat and dress for the Royal Wedding. The young prince wore a cream cardigan over a white shirt, matching shorts and leather shoes . Smart: Meanwhile, a hands-free William disembarked the plane looking dapper in a navy blue suit . The House of Walker clearly won Middleton loyalty on that day. Carole wore Catherine Walker again to George’s christening. It wasn’t long before Kate turned to Walker too, choosing the label to make two stunning outfits for her first official trip to Canada. One, a grey wool pencil dress, was particularly striking, showing off Kate’s slender post-wedding figure to perfection. However, this week’s outfit won’t win as many fashion plaudits. It looked more Virgin air hostess than royal style icon - add a slash of red lipstick and a jauntily-tied scarf and she’d be offering you a glass of champagne before take-off. Diana isn’t the only royal from whom Kate is taking style inspiration. She is also wearing the Queen’s diamond fern brooch, a gift from the Women of Auckland in 1954 and what appear to be American tan tights. Hands full: Kate was carrying baby George and holding onto the railing of the plane's stairs at the same time . However, where were the hemline weights which preserve Her Majesty modesty on even the most blustery days? Instead, Kate’s fabulous thighs had another airing as she walked down the aeroplane steps, which sadly detracted from what could have otherwise been a polished look. The Gina Foster pillbox hat, too – a little bit Jackie O, but a lot more Queen Mum – marks her out as one of the family, part of the Royal lineage, mother and wife to heirs to the throne. Her £400 shoes from London boutique Emmy (with a matching £200 clutch) make a welcome change from those nude LK Bennet heels she’s so attached to, and lengthen her already fabulous legs. Her red coat and dress also showcased her neat waist and slender limbs beautifully. Kate clearly knows - just as her late mother-in-law did - that a Catherine Walker ensemble shows a woman’s figure off to its best advantage.","Kate stepped off plane in longer coat - but it was caught by a gust of wind .

"By . Richard Spillett . A delivery driver has been sacked after he filmed himself driving behind an ambulance and bragging it is 'the quickest way to work'. Danny Jones, 22, posted a video on his Facebook page of him following an ambulance along the A49 near Warrington, Cheshire. In the mobile phone footage, he boasts: 'I appear to have found a quicker way to work. Everybody is beeping at me and I don't care. Scroll down for video . Danny Jones was sacked from his job after posting a video of himself laughing and joking as he drove behind an ambulance on the A49 . Mr Jones points the camera at other cars in the video and jokes: 'Pulling over, pulling over' 'Are you ready? This is the quickest way to work. Follow that f*****. That's what thou wants to do lads.' Pointing at other cars, he says: 'Pulling over, pulling over, not me lad, I'm there, I'm on it, I'm going past. Ta-ra all.' Mr Jones, from Wigan, Greater Manchester, adds: 'Know what I mean? And the Jones strikes again.' The video attracted thousands of views, with Mr Jones quickly amassing more than 24,000 Facebook followers. But he later faced an angry backlash from some viewers, before local authorities criticised his 'irresponsible actions'. In the video, which Mr Jones posted on his Facebook page, he can be heard saying: 'That's what thou wants to do lads. And the Jones strikes again.' His actions have been branded 'shocking and irresponsible' by road safety campaigners . Mr Jones now claims 'the video has been made out to be a lot worse than it actually is' A spokesman for road safety charity Brake said: 'This is a shocking example of irresponsible driving. 'Anyone that uses a mobile phone behind the wheel is taking an unnecessary risk and increasing their chances of being involved in a serious crash. 'Emergency services personnel are specially trained to drive in emergency situations and trying to keep up with them is foolish, dangerous and potentially illegal.' A representative of the North West Ambulance Service added: 'We do not condone any acts of dangerous driving as they can have serious consequences for both the driver and other road users. 'Our crews are trained to drive in emergency situations and to drive through traffic quickly and safely. It is not safe for a non-emergency vehicle to be driven in the same way.' Mr Jones now says he has been unfairly vilified over the video and insists he did nothing illegal . He says he has struggled to find work since losing his job as a delivery driver over the video . Despite claiming his bosses found the video hilarious, he was sacked by the courier firm where he worked and is now looking for a new job. Mr Jones later took down the video and posted the message: 'I have had a lot more positive responses than negatives from the video, but I've taken it down now and even deleted all of my other vidoes. 'I've got a credible driving licence and I don't want this to get any worse than it is - I have already lost my job because of videos I've posted on my Facebook page. And I have struggled to find a job since.' He has since defended his driving and insisted he did nothing illegal. The video was filmed along a stretch of the A49 towards Warrington, Cheshire . He said: 'I wasn’t actually doing anything wrong, the video has been made out to be a lot worse than it actually is - that was the purpose of the video but in reality I wasn’t doing anything wrong. 'I pulled over to let the ambulance past, I was driving under the speed limit, I didn’t go through any red lights. 'I wasn’t stopping the ambulance from doing its job and I wasn’t causing any issues as I made sure that I was keeping my distance. 'I was holding the steering wheel and my phone was in a holder while it was recording - I was driving safely, I knew it would be daft of me to do anything illegal in my vidoes. 'Really, I was just on my way to work and there happened to be an ambulance in front of me and I happened to be at the front of the line of cars and behind the ambulance. 'I have made the video out to be worse than it is, and made the situation worse for myself, by saying ""this is the quickest way to get to work"" and it has backfired on me.'","Danny Jones posted video of himself online following an ambulance .

After she bravely defended her home, the burglars ran off empty handed . Yesterday she said: 'I was in bed at the time because I have to rest each day because of my arthritis. My daughter Becky was in the shower and my husband Stephen was out. 'Stephen is a dental technician and we have a dental lab out in our garden. As a result we don't lock the gate as customers use it and we often had the back door open. 'On the day of the attack I heard the doorbell go but I thought it was just a customer who would go away if I ignored them. 'But then I heard the gate and someone opening the back door and I shouted to Becky. I went downstairs and saw the car keys had gone. I opened the door and the two men were there trying to open the gate for the cars using a crowbar. 'I was so furious at the cheek of it that I just ran at them shouting 'stop, stop, stop'. I wasn't really thinking but then one of them hit me. I managed to put my arm up and tried to give him something back. 'Then the other one started attacking me and just kept punching me in the face.

I think I managed to do it through sheer adrenaline. 'I didn't break anything but my jaw was cracked so I can't eat anything solid and the bruising is still around my eyes. It was really bad straight afterwards. 'It is only really hitting me now, I think I have been in shock since it happened. It has changed my life forever because I can't be in the house on my own, I have to have everything locked and I have had a panic attack in the town.

"By . Harriet Arkell . A vicar who went on a rowing pilgrimage from Dorset to Cornwall and back is believed to have drowned after he was found dead on a beach near his wrecked boat. The body of Reverend Bob Thorn, 59, was washed up on a beach near Seatown, just five miles from his parish of Burton Bradstock, Dorset, on Monday, shortly after his damaged rowing boat was found nearby. The popular clergyman was on a three-month sabbatical when he rowed a 10ft wooden boat from his home in Dorset to Cornwall last month on a religious pilgrimage. Popular Dorset vicar, the Reverend Bob Thorne, 59, is believed to have drowned while rowing home from Cornwall . He is believed to have been rowing the 150 miles back to his parish along the south coast when he got into trouble. Police and coastguards searched a 50-mile stretch of coastline from West Bay in Dorset to Teignmouth in Devon after the empty and damaged timber boat was washed ashore. After several hours of searching, the vicar's body was found in a small cove a few hundred feet along the beach from where his boat was discovered. Officers say they are not treating the death of Mr Thorn, who was married to Jean, also a priest, and had four children, as suspicious.  A post-mortem has yet to be carried out. Mr Thorn, rector of the Bride Valley Benefice, which covers eight churches, was a keen rower who undertook long spiritual voyages, a tradition started by Celtic Christian monks in the sixth and seventh centuries. Before he left the clergyman had asked his parishioners to pray for his safe return in a parish newsletter, saying: 'When I say, please pray for me, I . have to say that I would love sunny skies and warm, helping breezes, but . they are not for you to ask. The married father of four was the vicar of Burton Bradstock, Dorset, and well-known in the community . Coastline: The vicar was found a few hundred yards from his boat in a cove near Seatown, west Dorset . 'They . will be as they are. But I do ask your prayers, please, for the . fortitude of God being with me, to be strong and of a good courage.' The . vicar, a talented folk singer who fought back after a life-threatening . stroke some years ago, left Burton Bradstock in February and rowed west . to the remote Pendower Beach near Falmouth in Cornwall, where he . intended to spend Lent 'living off the land and sea and being at one . with God'. He undertook the journey in small stages, pulling into small coves and beaches, some of them only accessible by sea, overnight. A spokesman for the Diocese of . Salisbury, which includes Burton Bradstock, said: 'Bob was a larger than . life character and rowing was something that was extremely important to . him - he was big into it. 'He was really into Celtic spirituality, and very much into rowing off to places, praying, and rowing back again.' The vicar was a talented folk singer, songwriter and guitarist who fought back after a life-threatening stroke . The popular vicar was found on a beach not far from his home on Monday, hours after his boat was found . The . Right Reverend Nicholas Holtam, Bishop of Salisbury, said he was . 'devastated' to learn of the death of 'a remarkable man of incredible . determination'. And the . Reverend Andrew Evans, rector of Bridport, said: 'Bob died doing . something that he passionately wanted to do, but of course the outcome . of it has been such a tragedy both for him and for Burton Bradstock.' Chief Inspector Dean O’Connor, from Dorset police, said: 'The next of kin have been updated, and there are no suspicious circumstances relating to the death.' Mr Thorn was an active member of the Bristol folk scene in the 1970s and recorded two albums called 2nd Best Guitar and The Shortest River in Dorset. Adrian Collis, his manager and friend, said: 'He was a very good songwriter, and part of his thinking of going on his latest pilgrimage was that he would write songs about it on his return, and share his experiences with people through his music. 'Sadly he will never get the chance to do that.' The clergyman had previously been on walking pilgrimages to the Holy island of Lindisfarne in Northumberland and to Canterbury, and last year published a book about his Lindisfarne trip.","The Reverend Bob Thorn, 59, was on return trip from Dorset to Cornwall .

"By . Leon Watson . A gang lay in wait for a man in his 20s before pouring acid over his face in a 'targeted' street attack, it was claimed today. Police launched an investigation following the assault in Maidenbower, Crawley, West Sussex, at 7.10pm yesterday. Paramedics, the air ambulance and police attended the scene, and the victim was taken to the Royal Sussex County Hospital. West Sussex Councillor Duncan Crow, who witnessed the attack, said on Twitter: 'I don’t believe what has just happened in Maidenbower. Investigation: Police in Crawley, Sussex where a man has been the victim of an acid attack . 'A man has been attacked with acid thrown in his face in a targeted attack. Thankfully the victim looks ok. Ambulance and six police cars now on scene.' Cllr Crow said the men had laid in wait for their victim. He said: 'I was at home working on my computer when I heard some shouting coming from outside, I initially ignored it and just assumed it was a normal argument. 'But then I heard screeching of tyres coming from the other side of where I live and I looked out the window to see a white Vauxhall Astra van being driven away at speed. 'I also saw a chubby black guy wearing a high-visibility jacket running down the road, I assumed he was initially separate from the incident but then I saw him jump in the van and it sped off at speed. 'He looked very plausible as a work man or somebody doing some door to door sales, he didn't look particularly suspicious. The block in Crawley, Sussex, outside which a man has been the victim of an acid attack . West Sussex Councillor Duncan Crow, who witnessed the attack, spoke about it on Twitter . 'When I looked out my other window I saw a guy rolling around on the grass shouting. A girl came out to see him and asked what was wrong and he said he had acid thrown over him. 'Others came out and were pouring water over him and treating him, I think even an off-duty fireman was present too. I was just so shocked by what I saw. 'It took a minute or so to piece it all together, I thought it was two separate incidents to begin with. 'I heard somebody say they must have been waiting for him to come home from work because it happened just as he got out of his car. It was clearly a targeted attack.' Mr Crow, a councillor for the local area, added that he believed the man lived in the block of flats where the attack happened, but he was not known to him. He also said the man had been discharged from hospital which led him to believe he was making a good recovery. 'Within 10 minutes of the attack he was up on his feet and was not shouting or screaming any more and you could see he was not badly injured,' he said. A Sussex Police spokesman said: 'Sussex Police attended an incident in Crawley where a man had what is believed to be acid thrown over him. 'Emergency services were called to the scene in Lyon Close at 7.10pm. A man in his early 20s was attacked by two men just after 7pm and had the chemical poured over his face and hands. 'The victim was taken to the Royal Sussex County Hospital in Brighton but was discharged. 'Police are making an urgent appeal for anyone who witnessed the incident or who may have seen two black men wearing hi-viz tops and in a white Vauxhall Astra van in the area before or after the attack.'","Men lay in wait for victim, aged in his 20s, before pouring acid on him .

"By . Sam Webb . Support: Royal Marine Sergeant Alexander Blackman's wife and mother have defended their son and argued he should be released . The wife of a Royal Marine jailed for life for murdering a wounded Taliban insurgent in Afghanistan says he 'bitterly regrets' the killing and should be released because 'he poses no threat to society'. Sergeant Alexander Blackman, 39, is serving at least ten years after being found guilty of killing the severely wounded captive in Afghanistan. Last year a court martial board found Blackman - known as 'Marine A' during the trial - guilty of murdering the insurgent who had been seriously injured in an attack by an Apache helicopter in Helmand more than two years ago. The killing was captured on a camera on his helmet and afterwards he told two men with him: 'Obviously this doesn’t go anywhere fellas. I just broke the Geneva Convention.' His family has told a documentary to be broadcast tonight that he was doing 'what he was sent out to do'. His wife Claire Blackman, 42, from Taunton, Somerset, told the BBC: 'He does bitterly regret it but hindsight is a wonderful thing. 'There were so many other factors embroiled in that decision. He was in charge of all of those other lads who were in a really, really dangerous situation. 'They didn't know who else was around on the ground. They had an insurgent who had clearly had explosives on him in their midst. 'The trouble is we are trying very hard . to rationalise something that happened in a warzone, in a different . country, on the other side of the world, in circumstances that none of . us will ever begin to understand. 'Bottom line, Al is no risk to society.' Shooting: Footage captured by a camera mounted on the helmet of a Royal Marine showing Sgt Blackman during a patrol in Afghanistan in which an insurgent was killed . Blackman's mother Frances has also told a BBC One documentary to be broadcast on tonight that her son was doing his job. She said: 'In my letters I write to him, I always put ""I am very proud of you son, you haven’t disgraced yourself, you haven’t disgraced us"".' She added: 'He was doing his duty to the country, and everybody in this country and the Queen and that’s what he was sent out to do, to get rid of the insurgents.' His sister, Melody, said: 'I’ll love him no matter what and I know he’s had to make different choices that I wouldn’t want to have to make personally, but it’s war'. After his sentencing on December 6, Blackman said he was 'devastated' at being handed a life sentence. Footage: Before a video of the murder came to light, Blackman was being considered for promotion to Colour Sergeant . He has said he feels ashamed at his actions, describing them as 'a stupid lack of self-control and lapse in judgment' Two other Marines were acquitted. Charges against a further two were previously discontinued. Blackman, who denied murder, had 15 years’ experience in the Royal Marines, having joined in 1998, and was in charge of Command Post Omar in Helmand during Operation Herrick 14 in 2011. He has said he feels ashamed at his actions, describing them as 'a stupid lack of self-control and lapse in judgment'. ‘Marine A: Criminal or Casualty of War?’ is on BBC One at 10.35pm today. The footage was captured by a camera mounted on the helmet of a Royal Marine in the aftermath of a helicopter attack in Helmand. He shot the unknown insurgent in the . chest but said he believed the man was already dead and he was taking . out his anger on a corpse. As the fighter lies on the floor convulsing and struggling for breath, Sgt Blackman tells him: 'There you are. Shuffle off this mortal coil you c***. It’s nothing you wouldn’t do to us.' He then turned to his comrades and said: 'Obviously this doesn’t go anywhere fellas. I just broke the Geneva Convention.' Blackman is the first British serviceman to be found guilty of murder during combat since the Second World War. Blackman completed tours of Iraq, . Afghanistan and Northern Ireland during his military career, and before a . video of the murder came to light, he was being considered for . promotion to Colour Sergeant.","Sergeant Alexander Blackman fired on the injured fighter as he lay dying .

"By . Leon Watson . One of Britain's best teenage sailors was heard saying 'sod it' after being begged to 'Go Faster!' before a horrific speedboat crash, a court heard today. Great . Britain sailing international Nia Jones then accelerated moments before the night time collision, it was claimed. Jones . and friend Elleni Morus, 17, were taking schoolgirls back after a day . of sailing when their high-powered speedboats crashed in darkness. Trial: Elleni Morus, left, and Nia Jones, right, are accused of acting recklessly before a boat collision . Crash: This is one of the boats involved in the collision during a half-term sailing trip in October 2010 . A court heard Jones began speeding and weaving after being told: 'Go faster, go faster' by her young passengers. But . after weaving in the dark and jumping the wake of her friend Morus' speedboat - they collided and sent schoolgirls flying into the cold dark . water. Jones and Morus were . in charge of a party of 24 schoolgirls aged ten to 14 on a residential . sailing course during half term holidays. The . court heard they had taken the girls ice skating for a treat and were . returning to their hostel by boat late at night when the they crashed . into each other. One of the schoolgirls thrown into the water during the crash said Jones was begged to go faster by her young passengers. The girl, who appeared via videolink, said: 'We were urging Nia to go faster and she said: 'Sod it' - and then did it. Elleni Morus (left) and Nia Jones (right), two of Britain's best girl sailors who crashed their boats into each other in Cardiff Bay leaving another schoolgirl with brain damage from the sea accident . Danger: The other boat involved in the crash, which took place when the boats did not have lights attached . Experienced: Morus and Jones were aged just 17 at the time of the accident, but were among the top young sailors in the country . 'We . were excited but some people told Nia to slow down. She went over the . wake of the other boat a couple of times before we crashed. 'It was quite dark and our boat and the other boat turned into each others wakes and we crashed. 'I . could see the other boat the whole time. Just before we collided I . think we all knew we were going to crash but we didn't move or scream - . we didn't have time to.' The . schoolgirl, who was 11 at the time of the crash, said she didn't . remember being thrown out of the boat - but she came to in the dark . water. She said: 'I was in . there for a couple of minutes before they picked me up. I was really . cold and I was quite shocked so I couldn't swim back to the boat.' Prosecutor . Oliver Willmott told the court how four inflatable speed boats had . illegally set off across Cardiff Bay without any lights in the night of . the crash. Court: Morus and Jones pictured with friends and family outside Cardiff Crown Court . Holiday: The pair were supervising a group of schoolgirls doing a residential course at Cardiff Bay, pictured . Cardiff Crown Court heard in the previous days the boats had been used for 'wake jumping'. Mr . Willmott said: 'This is where each boat jumps the others wake for a . thrill road. It is also quite a potentially dangerous thing to do. 'There came a point where Jones came across the path of Morus and they collided. 'It . was a sufficiently violent collision to throw two people into the water . and to cause a third person to fall halfway into the water. 'A . fourth young girl was thrown from one boat and landed in the other. In . the most severe case a young girl suffered a brain injury of moderate . severity.' The court heard the young 11-year-old victim was not named. The . organisers of the sailing course - Nicholas Sawyer and Cardiff Bay . Yacht Club - have admitted offences in connection with the accident and . breaking Health and Safety regulations. The court heard Jones and Morus, both of Cardiff, were not qualified to drive the high-powered rigid inflatable boats at night. Morus and Jones, now both 20, admit piloting the boats without navigation lights on the night of 27 October 2010. But both deny failing to travel at a safe speed and failing to keep a proper lookout. The trial continues. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Court hears Nia Jones was told: 'Go faster, go faster' by passengers .

"By . Darren Boyle . PUBLISHED: . 12:05 EST, 9 April 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 12:32 EST, 9 April 2014 . It is the highest military award for bravery awarded by a grateful nation, but despite storming a German machine gun post, Thomas Whitham was forced to pawn his hard-won Victoria Cross because his local council would not give him a job. Private Whitham dodged bullets and shells while under heavy fire to capture the German machine gun at Pilckem, near Ypres in Belgium on July 31, 1917. However, upon returning from frontline duties, Private Whitham, from Worsthorne near Burnley, found it difficult to find work, dying in poverty aged only 36. Thomas Whitham (pictured) won the Victoria Cross after capturing a German machine gun in Ypres Belgium that was threatening to wipe out his battalion in July 1917 . Private Whitham was feted upon his return from the front line after receiving his Victoria Cross and a gold watch from Burnley Council . Private Whitham pawned his medal and watch shortly before his death in October 1924 . Private Whitham died following an accident in 1924 while seeking work and was buried at Wheatley Lane Inghamite Burial Ground near Burnley. His family could not afford to buy a headstone to mark the hero's final resting place. Yet, Burnley Council redeemed the medal, gold watch and a clock in 1931 and put them on display in Towneley Hall in the town. A notice in the London Gazette of September 6, 1917 outlined Private Whitham's bravery and announced his award: 'For . most conspicuous bravery when, during an attack, an enemy machine-gun . was seen to be enfilading the battalion on the right. 'Private Whitham, . on his own initiative, immediately worked his way from shell-hole to . shell-hole through our own barrage, rushed the machine-gun, and, . although under a very heavy fire, captured it, together with an officer . and two other ranks. 'The bold action on the part of Private Whitham was . of great assistance to the battalion on the right, and undoubtedly saved . many lives and enabled the whole line to advance.' Private Whitham braved intense enemy fire and closed in on the enemy position capturing the machine gun . Almost 30 years after his death, the Coldstream Guards Association erected a memorial marking Private Whitham's grave. Burnley Council redeemed Private Whitham's medal and watch from the pawnbroker in 1931, seven years after his death. However, Private Whitham's son William spent decades trying to convince Burnley Council to return the medal to the family so they could present it to the Coldstream Guards Museum. The issue was raised in the House of Commons by Tory MP Nick Hawkins in March 1994. A lone soldier looks out over the battlefield at Ypres where Thomas Whitham won his Victoria Cross . Thomas Whitham's son William spent almost 40 years trying to get his father's Victoria Cross back from Burnley Council, even having the matter raised in Parliament . Mr Hawkins told the Commons:  'Private Whitham's son has for nerly 40 years been trying to get his late father's Victoria Cross medal displayed at the Coldstream Guards Museum, his late father's regiment, instead of where it currently is, in a museum in Burnley.' Mr Hawkins said: 'This was supposed to be the land fit for heroes to live in.' He said when Private Whitham sought manual work from Burnley Council he received a 'curt and humiliatingly dismissive' rejection letter - less than twelve months after returning from the front. The Commons heard that Mr Whitham almost secured his father's medal for £50 in 1948 when a change of council leadership scuppered the deal. Mr Hawkins added: 'Over many years . since, all attempts to persuade Burnley Council to release the medal . have failed, even though for many years it appears that the medal and . its ribbon were not at all well looked after."" However, . in recent years officials in his home town decided that a sixth-form . college in the town should be named after the war hero. Speaking . at the time of the naming ceremony, headmaster of the Thomas Whitham . Sixth Form College said: 'Thomas's story demonstrates that everyone from . whatever background has in them the potential to achieve something . significant in their life and, therefore illustrates perfectly the ethos . of the Sixth Form, which is high achievement for people from whatever . background.' The Victoria Cross was introduced by Queen Victoria on January 29, 1856 to reward acts of valour during the Crimean War. Since then, the VC has been awarded 1,356 times to 1,353 individuals. Only 13 VCs have been awarded since World War Two. The . original medals were cast from Russian bronze . cannon captured during the battle of Sebastopol during the Crimean . campaign. However the remaining medals have been cast from cannon captured during the Second Anglo-Chinese War of 1860. Tory Party supporter Lord Ashcroft owns more than 160 of the coveted medals. There is a thriving trade in the medals which can be worth as much as £1.5m. The most recent Victoria Cross was awarded to L/Cpl James Ashworth, who died in Afghanistan in June 2012 .","Thomas Whitham stormed a German machine gun nest saving his battalion during heavy fighting near Ypres in July 1917 .

"By . Leon Watson . Christopher Dean Owens, 20, died on Sunday after police suspect he took a home-made ecstasy tablet at his home in South Shields . Police have issued a fresh warning over the dangers of home-made drugs after a man died taking what is believed to be an ecstasy tablet. Christopher Owens, from South Shields, was taken to South Tyneside District Hospital after his father called the ambulance service on Sunday morning. The 20-year-old had suffered a fit in his home and it is thought he had taken an illegal substance. Police were called to the address at around 2.20pm and confirmed the tablet taken was a pale green colour. While . most ecstasy pills found on the market are believed to be imported from . Holland and Belgium, officers described this batch as 'potentially . home-made'. Residents have spoken of their shock at finding out about Mr Owens. Marie . Smith, who lives next door, said it was confusing with police and . ambulance vehicles blocking the street on Sunday morning. 'It . was like a hospital,' she said. 'There were blue flashing lights . everywhere and a few hours later the police arrived with their dogs. Police described the batch of pills pictured here as 'potentially home-made' The road in South Shields where Christopher Owens, 20, lived before he was taken to hospital and died . Ms Smith continued: 'When . the paramedics brought the young man out he was wearing very little and . he had an oxygen mask on his face. He looked in a really bad way. I . knew immediately that drugs had to be involved. 'I've lived here for over 23 years, but I didn't know the family very well because they've only lived here 18 months and they kept themselves to themselves. 'I don't think there was a mother living with them, I only ever saw the dad.' A woman who lives nearby, but did not wish to be named, said she's still in a state of shock. Mr Owens, from South Shields, was taken to South Tyneside District Hospital after his father called the ambulance service on Sunday morning . 'It's absolutely unbelievable,' she said. 'He was far too young to die and it must be devastating for the family. I can't believe this has happened on such a quiet road like ours.' Police have issued a warning of . the dangers of taking illegal drugs. South Tyneside coroner Mr Carney has also expressed his concerns for members of the public taking any similar tablets. Detective Inspector Paul Woods said: . 'These tablets are potentially very dangerous and anyone thinking of . taking any drug, particularly one similar to this, should not. 'If anyone thinks they have taken this drug they should seek immediate medical attention.' So far, no arrests have been made.","Christopher Owens, from South Shields, died on Sunday .

"By . Richard Spillett . A fitness company and a director have been fined nearly £40,000 after a customer had his finger severed when putting together a faulty running machine. James Max, 37, bought the £340 treadmill with his wife Natalie, 33, in a bid to lose weight and improve his fitness. But as he putting the machine together a spring-loaded hydraulic arm flew open and sliced off the tip of his wedding ring finger. James Max, left, had part of his finger sliced off while assembling the £340 running machine, right . He employed a company to examine the treadmill and they discovered the remains of his finger inside, but it was too late for it to be re-attached. IRG Europe Ltd and director James Sharkey were fined a total of £39,600 this week after they admitted supplying the machine which was not safely packaged and with insufficient instructions. Nottingham Crown Court heard Mr Max was constructing the machine on April 30 last year at his home in Aslockton, Nottinghamshire when the incident occurred. He was rushed to the Queens Medical Centre in Nottingham but doctors could do nothing to reconstruct the top portion of his finger which had been torn off. Speaking after the case, Mr Max said: 'This injury has changed my life, I work with computers and I am now having to learn to type again. 'I used to be fast and be able to touch-type but not anymore, I am starting from scratch. Father-of-one Mr Max says the injury has made it his work with computers more difficult . 'Little things such as shaking someone's hand, gardening or opening a bottle are hard for me and I have to think about those things more which I will learn to get used to. 'I do have mobility in my finger, although the nerve ending was cut which is why it makes things difficult for me to do things. 'I am glad it didn't happen to my daughter, who was in another room at the time, that would have been truly awful. 'Since the incident I have bought another treadmill and the warnings on the box and packaging were easy to see, so there were no more injuries. Mr Max was attempting to put a IM Fitness Stamina XTI Treadmill together when the accident happened. IRG Europe Ltd admitted supplying the machine, which was not safely packaged and with insufficient instructions . 'I haven't had an apology from IRG Europe Ltd or James Sharkey, I would like one, but I doubt it will be coming anytime soon, which is a shame.' Councillor Glynn Gilfoyle, Chair of Nottinghamshire County Council's Community Safety Committee, said: 'This company has blatantly ignored current safety standards and have put their customers at risk of severe injury. 'Unfortunately, James Max has suffered greatly due their negligence which would have been avoided with proper warnings to prevent the treadmill from flipping up. 'All sellers have a responsibility to ensure that their products are safe and we will pursue those who flagrantly flout current safety standards.'","James Max bought the £340 treadmill for his home so he could lose weight .

"By . Richard Spillett . Detectives are investigating three decades of alleged sexual abuse at a top London public school, it emerged today. The Metropolitan Police are looking into historical claims of abuse at St Paul's boys' school and its prep school, Colet Court, after a number of pupils who attended the school between the 1960s and 1980s were said to have come forward with new information. The inquiry comes just months after a classics teacher at Colet Court resigned his post after he was arrested and bailed on suspicion of possession of indecent images. Another former teacher at the school has also been arrested and bailed as part of the investigation. Classics teacher Anthony Fuggle, 57, has resigned from St Paul's boys' school after he was arrested on suspicion of possession of indecent images . Chancellor George Osborne and Attorney . General Dominic Grieve QC are among the school's most famous former . pupils, although there is no suggestion either were victims of abuse. Police confirmed they made their first arrest last summer before bringing a second man into custody earlier this year. A . spokesman said: 'We can confirm that the Child Abuse Investigation Team . at Feltham is investigating historic allegations of sexual abuse . alleged to have taken place between the 1960s and 1980s. 'On 27 February, a 65-year-old man was . arrested in connection with the investigation. He was taken into custody . and subsequently bailed to return pending further inquiries. Next due . on a date in early May. Police have launched an investigation into three decades of alleged sexual abuse at St Paul's School in south west London . Former pupils of the school include Chancellor George Osborne (left) and Attorney General Dominic Grieve QC (right). there is no suggestion either were victims of abuse . 'Previously, on 10 September 2013, a 57-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of possession of indecent images. He has been bailed until a date in late April. 'We are aware of a number of potential victims and witnesses who we wish to speak to over the course of the investigation. Inquiries continue.' The men arrested were today named by The Times as classics teacher and former administration director at Colet Court, Anthony Fuggle, 57, who resigned his post this academic year, and former geography teacher and rowing coach Patrick Marshall, 65, who denies any wrongdoing. The investigation into Mr Fuggle is believed to have been sparked when photographs of boys were found on a school computer during IT checks. Parents and former pupils have been sent a letter by the school, which says it is assisting police with their inquiries. The school was founded in 1509 and moved from its original site near St Paul's Cathedral to its current riverside campus in Barnes, south west London in 1968. According to its website, fees are £10,411 for a term of boarding and £6,951 per term of days. An Ofsted inspection in March 2013 described quality of learning at the school as 'exceptional'.

"By . Katy Winter . Earlier this week it was reported Kelly Brook allegedly shelled out for her own rock following a proposal from her ex-Gladiator boyfriend, David McIntosh. And while getting engaged is meant to be one of - if not the - most romantic moments of a woman’s life, it seems Ms Brook is part of a growing trend. Increasing numbers of women are apparently just as concerned with the quality of the ring as the proposal itself with one in five (21 per cent) having purchased their own bling. Kelly Brook may have paid for her own engagement ring following David McIntosh's proposal, according to reports . It seems purchasing jewellery to celebrate an engagement is no longer seen as the sole responsibility of the husband-to-be, but instead something which should be shared between couples. Over half of the UK’s unmarried ladies (54 per cent) said they would willingly contribute – no doubt to ease what is increasingly seen as a financial burden in addition to the actual wedding itself. In line with more traditional values, those over the age of 55 years (65 per cent) would be less willing to pay for a ring, but for the younger, unmarried audience (18-24 years) it’s not something they’re opposed to – a quarter don’t see it as a problem. One in five women (6 million British females) now pay for their own engagement ring . Purchasing a ring is no longer seen as the sole responsibility of man, but instead something which should be shared between couples . And for the slightly older bracket (35-44 years) - in particular those who’ve not yet been down the aisle - a third would happily pay for their own sparkler. 1. Wrexham – 43% . 2. Cambridge – 38% . 3.  Bristol – 37% . 4. Aberdeen – 33% . 5. Aberystwyth – 32% . 6. Leeds – 31% . 7. Edinburgh – 27% . 8. Sheffield – 25% . 9. London – 24% . Commenting on the findings, Joanna Mansbridge, Head of Jewellery Buying at QVC, who conducted the survey, said: ‘We live in a modern world where women today are making their own money. ‘It's no longer a man's stressful responsibility to choose the perfect ring and pay for it alone – these findings show ladies are more than happy to contribute and actually enjoy the selection process. 'Why risk so much money on something they may not even like! 'If a man still feels he wants a traditional proposal – down on one knee with a ring on offer – why not choose a replica version first that looks the real deal but won't break the bank and then have the fun of shopping together for the official one.’","Over half of UK single ladies would be willing to contribute to ring .

"By . Harriet Arkell . The mother of murdered teenager Stephen Lawrence has been named the most powerful woman in the country in a list compiled for Radio 4's Woman's Hour. Home Secretary Theresa May, who was ranked second in last year's inaugural Woman's Hour Power List, said Baroness Lawrence was 'an example to us all'. Her son, an 18-year-old student, was stabbed to death by a group of up to six white youths in an unprovoked racist attack as he waited at a bus stop in Eltham, south east London, with a friend on April 22 1993. It took more than 18 years to bring two of his killers to justice. Dignity: Doreen Lawrence, 61, whose son Stephen, 18, was murdered in a racist attack in 1993, has been named most powerful woman in the country by BBC Radio 4's Woman's Hour because 'she has never given up' NHS whistleblower Julie Bailey, who helped expose failings at Stafford Hospital, is second on the list . Cancer specialist Professor Nazneen Rahman, left, and Carmel McConnell, who fights to make sure children don't go to school hungry, are named as third and fourth on the list of the UK's most powerful women . Mrs May said: 'Faced by a terrible tragedy, she picked herself up and carried on fighting to ensure that justice could be done, and the fight still continues. 'What is most striking about this woman is the great strength that she has shown over decades - strength to carry on, to keep on going, even in the most difficult times when all seemed impossible. 'Also striking is the persistence that she has shown, because she has never given up. 'And finally, what is most impressive about this game-changer is that throughout it all, over the years, despite blow after blow, she has dealt with everything with absolute dignity.' The list of ten women, described as 'game-changers', was revealed in a live programme and included individuals involved in issues including female genital mutilation (FGM), child poverty and internet safety. Journalist Emma Barnett, who chaired the judging panel, said: 'It was no easy feat to come up with just 10 women who have 'changed the game' - so we had to develop a thesis. Anti female genital mutilation (FGM) activists Nimco Ali, left, and Leyla Hussein are joint sixth on Radio 4's list . Girlguiding CEO, Julie Bentley, left, and TalkTalk Group CEO Dido Harding are fifth and seventh on the list . 'The ambition for this year's list was to capture a snapshot of a moment in time - of those particular 'games' in 2014 that need changing and the women making a real difference in those fields. 'FGM is now taken seriously by politicians, while internet safety and child poverty are among the biggest problems society faces, and we have highlighted the women leading the charge to make sustainable changes in these areas and seven others.' Professor Nazneen Rahman, head of genetics at the Institute of Cancer Research, is honoured for her work researching the genes that cause cancer. Dido Harding, CEO of TalkTalk Group, was named for her work with the government on the dangers of internet safety, and how to protect children online. And Carmel McConnell, who founded the Magic Breakfast charity which works to present children from poverty-stricken families going to school hungry, was named fourth in the list. Comedian and disability activist Francesca Martinez,  and Everyday Sexism  founder, Laura Bates, are named .

"By . Phil Duncan . Esteban Gutierrez was taken to hospital for precautionary checks after his jaw-dropping crash with Pastor Maldonado in Sunday's Bahrain Grand Prix. Maldonado was handed three penalties by the stewards after the stunning incident which saw Gutierrez roll his Sauber. The Lotus driver clumsily t-boned Gutierrez as he exited the pits, subsequently flipping the Sauber airborne. Roll over: Pastor Maldonado t-bones Esteban Gutierrez thus launching the Sauber airborne . Going over: The Sauber driver was taken to hospital for precautionary checks but later released . In trouble: The Mexican was fortunate to walk away from the accident relatively unscathed . The view from on-board: Gutierrez is left a passenger as his Sauber is sent airborne by Maldonado . The crash led to the deployment of the safety car, with Gutierrez fortunate to walk away relatively unscathed from the incident on lap 40. Maldonado was handed a ten second stop-and-go penalty during the race by the stewards, and a five-place grid penalty to be served at the Chinese Grand Prix in a fortnight. As a further punishment, he was also given three penalty points on his licence. Nine more and he'll be hit with a one-race ban. 'Good news! Esteban Gutierrez has completed all medical checks and everything is fine. He has been released from the hospital,' Sauber later said. Hats off to all at Mercedes for allowing Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg go toe-to-toe for the race win. It would have been much easier for the top brass at Mercedes to impose team orders on the duelling pair and thus denying us all of a brilliant spectacle. Refreshingly Paddy Lowe asked both drivers to bring both cars home – as opposed to requesting them to hold station – and his order was duly obliged. Can Mercedes however, continue with this approach? I see no reason why not. Such is their advantage, they could collide at more than one race this season and still lead both championships.  Indeed, the Silver Arrows are already 67 points clear of their nearest challengers. Whether such an occurrence would be good for team morale is, however, another debate. Team game: Mercedes celebrated their second 1-2 finish in as many races - they lead the constructors' championship . Pure theatre: Rosberg (left) and Hamilton duel for the lead of the Bahrain Grand Prix . Three-time world champion Niki Lauda claimed Sunday's race was one of the greatest grands prix he'd ever witnessed – high praise indeed from a man who has been involved in the sport for the best part of five decades. 'If anybody complains that F1 is boring then they are an idiot,' he added. And few would contest Lauda's sentiments. Aside from one of the greatest on-track battles for the win, there was also action right throughout the field. From the warring Williams duo of Valterri Bottas and Felipe Massa, to a sublime inter-team battle between Force India drivers' Sergio Perez and Nico Hulkenberg, and Daniel Ricciardo picking his way through the field after starting 13th, Sunday's race really did have it all. If this is Formula One in crisis, then you'll have no complaints from me. Roll on, China. What drama: The Bahrain Grand Prix was one of the finest Formula One races in recent times . 'Daniel is quicker than you. Let him go by please'. The radio message relayed to Sebastian Vettel that none of us ever expected to hear. Ricciardo wasn't given a hope in heck of showing up his four-time world champion team-mate after he was unveiled as Mark Webber's successor at Red Bull. How wrong we all were. After blowing his Red Bull team-mate away in qualifying, Vettel was then ordered to move out of Ricciardo's way during Sunday's race. Admittedly the two were on differing strategies at that point in the race. But in the closing stages of the grand prix, with Ricciardo behind Vettel, the Australian, brimming with confidence, laid down another marker on his team-mate when he executed a perfect move for fifth place. He then passed Nico Hulkenberg before coming up just short of a podium finish. Not bad after starting 13th. Bravo. Man on a mission: Daniel Ricciardo finished fourth after starting Sunday's race in 13th following his grid penalty . Jenson Button marked his 250th grand prix with McLaren ahead of Sunday's race as the team posed for a host of group photos sporting commemorative t-shirts. It's a good job they celebrated Button's impressive landmark before the race as they had little to fawn over in the aftermath. Kevin Magnussen became the first McLaren driver to retire from a race since Lewis Hamilton crashed out at the Brazilian Grand Prix in 2012 when he suffered a terminal gearbox issue . And the problem was somewhat contagious with Button suffering a similar race-ending glitch. 'I was running in fifth and it was going to be a interesting race,' said Button. 'The guys then said stop changing gears which was a little bit difficult. 'At the restart it took a second to change at every gear shift. I thought we could get to the end but it failed and we had to retire.' Button's 250th start came in Formula One's 900th race meaning the Brit can boast appearing in 28 per cent of all world championship races.","Esteban Gutierrez hospitalised after he is t-boned by Pastor Maldonado .

"By . Hugo Gye . Irish President Michael D. Higgins was today given a guided tour of Windsor Castle by the Duke of York, as part of his groundbreaking state visit to the UK. He inspected a tribute to the bravery of Irish soldiers which has hung above a grand stairway in the Royal palace for nearly a century. Later, the President - who attended a ceremonial banquet hosted by the Queen in Windsor last night - visited 10 Downing Street for a meeting with David Cameron. Tour: The Duke of York today showed Michael D. Higgins around Windsor Castle . Visit: The Irish President is currently on a historic state trip to the UK . Inspection: Mr Higgins looked at the colours of Irish regiments of the British army, disbanded in 1922 . Mr Higgins and his wife Sabina, accompanied by Prince Andrew, viewed the colours of the regiments of the British Army that were disbanded when Ireland gained independence in 1922. They were placed in the castle by King George V in honour of the sacrifice made by Irish soldiers in the First World War and other conflicts. The colours have never been moved from their permanent setting - except when the 1992 Windsor fire threatened to destroy them. 'Needs must, we took them out,' the Duke of York - who is colonel-in-chief of the Royal Irish Regiment - told the couple. Couple: Mr Higgins, who is a noted poet as well as an experienced politician, is accompanied by his wife Sabina . Poignant: The colours of the former Irish regiments have been at Windsor Castle for nearly a century . Grandeur: Windsor Castle last night hosted a sumptuous banquet attended by Irish dignitaries . Before Ireland became independent from the UK, soldiers from the island frequently served in the British Army. Six regiments were particularly populated by soldiers from southern Ireland - the Royal Irish Regiment, the Royal Dublin Fusiliers, the Connaught Rangers, the Prince of Wales' Leinster Regiment (Royal Canadians), the Royal Munster Fusiliers and the South Irish Horse. The regiments served alongside other British soldiers in the Boer War and First World War. In 1922, all but six counties of Ireland seceded from the UK, forming the Irish Free State. The regiments which drew their men from the area no longer under British control were disbanded that year, but King George V was determined that their sacrifices would not be forgotten. Their regimental colours were erected above a staircase at one of the entrances to Windsor Castle, where they have stayed for 92 years. They have been held at Windsor since the establishment of the Irish Free State in 1922, when the six regiments of the British Army from that part of Ireland which had become independent were disbanded. In a message to all six regiments, George V said: 'The Colours are to be preserved and held in reverence at Windsor Castle as a perpetual record of your noble exploits in the field.' Mr and Mrs Higgins looked over the colours of the Royal Irish Regiment, the Royal Dublin Fusiliers, the Connaught Rangers, the Prince of Wales' Leinster Regiment (Royal Canadians), and the Royal Munster Fusiliers. The South Irish Horse did not have a colour. There were 58,000 Irish soldiers in the British army at the start of the First World War, while 140,000 volunteered for units that were stationed in Ireland during the war. As well as Windsor Castle and Downing Street, Mr Higgins was scheduled to visit University College Hospital to meet NHS workers from Ireland. He was also planning to pay a trip to the Royal Society and London's City Hall. Summit: The Irish President visited 10 Downing Street for a meeting with David Cameron . Allies: Mr Higgins' visit is intended to further cement the close ties between Ireland and the UK . Unprecedented: The Irish flag flew on a royal limousine outside Number 10 today . Windsor Castle was the setting for a historic state banquet in Mr Higgins's honour yesterday, where the Queen said that Britain and Ireland shall 'no longer allow our past to ensnare our future'. Northern Ireland deputy first minister and ex-IRA commander Martin McGuinness stood and joined in a toast to the Queen, the Duke of Edinburgh and the people of the UK as an orchestra played God Save The Queen. In his speech, Mr Higgins made reference to the Queen's historic visit to Ireland, saying: 'Admirably, you chose not to shy away from the shadows of the past, recognising that they cannot be ignored when we consider the relationship between our islands.' He said he valued her 'apt and considered words when you addressed some of the painful moments of our mutual history'.","Duke of York took Michael D. Higgins around Windsor Castle today .

"By . Chris Pleasance . A former Premiership football star today formally denied claims that he had become an Islamic warrior fighting in Syria. Lassana Diarra, 29, who played for a number of big name English clubs including Arsenal, Chelsea and Portsmouth, said he had never set foot in the war-torn country. Eric Dupond-Moretti, a lawyer for the France international, said Paris-born Diarra 'denies in the most formal, the most categoric, the most absolute fashion that he has gone to Syria'. Scroll down for video . Former Arsenal, Chelsea and Portsmouth player Lassana Diara (right) has been forced to deny rumours circulating on Twitter that he is a jihadist fighting in Syria . In a video posted on an extremist website on Saturday a man claimed to be of a former Arsenal footballer now fighting in Syria, sparking Twiter rumours that it was the defensive midfielder . Diarra is now playing in Russia, said Mr Dupond-Moretti, who added: 'He has never set foot in Syria. It's absurd. He is not a jihadist, he is a footballer with Lokomotiv Moscow.' There were social media rumours that Diarra had gone to Syria, where a civil war is now into a fourth year and has cost more than 150,000 lives. Mr Dupond-Moretti said Diarra was expected to turn out for his Russian team in a league game on Sunday. After winning the FA Cup with Pompey in 2008, Diarra joined Real Madrid and was a member of the squad that won the Spanish championship in 2010. Hundreds of young Muslim Frenchmen are currently fighting jihad in Syria, mainly for Al Qaeda forces. French Prime Minister Manuel Valls has warned that all those who return home will create a huge security risk. Earlier this year two teenage French boys ran away from school to travel to Syria to join the war there, before being arrested in Turkey. The footage, which appeared at the weekend and is apparently shot in Syria, shows the man calling on Muslims in the West to travel to the war-torn region and fight with radical militants. The man, whose face is hidden by a balaclava and is seen clutching a AK47 rifle, is identified as Abu Isa al-Andalus. A lawyer for the French national says he has never even set foot in Syria and currently plays football in Russia . The man's face is covered during the video, in which he clutches an AK47 assault rifle . According to FiSyria.com, the site that posted the video, the man moved to London from his native country to play for Arsenal after growing up alongside a world-famous footballer. It claims the man was radicalised in the capital two years ago before 'leaving everything' to join the al-Qaeda-affiliated Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS). He later adds: 'We have conquered . many cities and we are now implementing the Sharia. We have areas where . the kaffirs (non-Muslims) are paying us the tax. 'If we stay in the kaffir countries we have to pay (taxes) to them. Do you want to be humiliated by this? Think about it. 'If you have family in these (Western) countries it's a must for you to put your children in the kaffir schools. ""Who is going to teach your children?"" It's going to maybe be a gay, maybe a drug dealer, maybe a paedophile. 'It's very important for you to protect your children. Allah says they are the worst of creatures.' The Russian-based website does not confirm the man's previous identity on the page, which shows two videos each roughly four-minutes long. A spokesman for Arsenal say they have no record of a past player called Abu Isa al-Andalus, although it is thought the man may have changed his identity . Text next to the video reads: 'He... played for Arsenal in London, and [then] left football, money and the European way of life to make the path of Allah.' Senior security officials have said that at least 250 British-based 'extremist tourists' have gone to Syria to train and fight. Director General of the Office for Security and Counter-Terrorism (OSCT) Charles Farr said earlier this year that the war in the country now presents 'the biggest challenge' since the 9/11 attacks in 2001. Mr Farr said: 'Syria is different from any other counter-terrorism challenge that we have faced since 9/11, because of the number of terrorist groups now engaged in the fighting, their size and scale, the number of people from this country who are joining them, ease of travel, availability of weapons and the intensity of the conflict.'","Extremist appeared in video claiming to be former Arsenal player .

"By . Margot Peppers . Nigerian and Cameroonian pop star Dencia has hit out at Lupita Nyong'o for her new contract with Lancome, accusing her of bowing to 'white people companies'. In an angry tweet directed at the 12 Years A Slave star, she wrote: 'Oh @Lupita_Nyongo cln't talk abt the bleaching creams white people (Companies) make cuz the white man pays her, they own her!! [sic]'. The comment comes just a month after Miss Nyong'o mentioned Dencia - who has been accused of marketing her own brand of skin-bleaching cream called Whitenicious - in a speech about learning to value the color of her own skin. Scroll down for video . Butting heads: Nigerian and Cameroonian pop star Dencia has hit out at Lupita Nyong'o for her new contract with Lancome, accusing her of bowing to 'white people companies' Fighting words: In a tweet directed at the 12 Years A Slave star, she wrote: 'Oh @Lupita_Nyongo cln't talk abt the bleaching creams white people (Companies) make cuz the white man pays her, they own her!! [sic]' The pop star is no stranger to . controversy; in a February interview with Ebony, she all but admitted . that Whitenicious is intended as a skin-lightener, not as a cure for . dark spots as it claims. 'When . you take that picture and you put a picture of Dencia darker, this is . what you're telling people - the product really works,' she said. 'And guess what? People really want to buy it. It's what it is. I don't really care.' Given her defiant and hypocritical attitude, it's no surprise the fiery singer was angered when Miss Nyong'o called her out in a speech at Essence's Black Women in Hollywood event on February 27. Influential: In a recent speech, Miss Nyong'o read out loud a letter from a fan who said she decided not to buy Dencia's skin-whitening cream Whitenicious because the actress had inspired her to love her own skin . On-screen: Miss Nyong'o won an Oscar for Best Supporting Actress for her role in 2013 film 12 Years A Slave . In her talk, the 30-year-old opened up about how conventional standards of beauty once affected her self-esteem, reading aloud a letter written to her by a young girl who viewed her as a role model. 'Dear Lupita,' reads the letter. 'I think you're really lucky to be this black but yet this successful in Hollywood overnight. I was just about to buy Dencia's Whitenicious cream to lighten my skin when you appeared on the world map and saved me.' 'My heart bled a little when I read those words,' the actress said through tears, explaining how as a child, she, too, would pray that she'd one day wake up with lighter skin. Hypocritical: Dencia is no stranger to controversy; in a February interview with Ebony, she essentially admitted that Whitenicious is intended as a skin-lightener, not as a cure for dark spots as it claims . Perpetuating the problem: 'When you take that picture and you put a picture of Dencia darker, this is what you're telling people - the product really works,' she said. 'And guess what? People really want to buy it' But while the actress saw the letter as a source of inspiration, Dencia took it as a personal attack. After her angry tweet at Miss Nyong'o, criticism poured in, with one person tweeting: 'B**** lupita is the new face of Lancôme!! SHE WINS!! And you're just TRASH [sic]'. In her response, Dencia said of the cosmetics company: 'But they sell bleaching cream tho [sic]'. The pop star is likely referring to Lancome's Blanc Expert range of cosmetics, which are actually advertised as 'brighteners' that 'regulate melanin production and awaken the luminosity of the skin'. And as far as Dencia's claim that Lancome is a 'white people company', a quick perusal of the website reveals that it has a number of concealers and foundations in darker skin tones.","Dencia's comment is hypocritical considering she recently courted controversy for marketing 'dark spot remover' Whitenicious, which is frequently used as a skin-whitening cream ."
"By . Daniel Miller . Members of a Texas hunting club have received death threats over plans to auction off a permit to kill a critically endangered black rhinoceros, despite insisting all the proceeds will go towards conservation efforts. The FBI is reviewing multiple threats made against members of the Dallas Safari Club which plans to auction the permit granted to them by the African country of Namibia on Saturday. The club's executive director, Ben . Carter, said about a dozen threatening messages were sent by email and . posted on the group's website. Critically endangered: A Texas hunting club has received death threats . over plans to auction off a permit to kill a Black Rhino, of which there . are only an estimated to be 4,000 remaining in the wild . Pledge: The Dallas Safari Club said all the proceeds from the auction would be used for conservation efforts . Other messages have been left with club sponsors criticizing support for the organization. 'I've had death threats on my family,' Mr Carter said. 'We've had a number of death threats to our members and (threats about) what would happen if we sell the permit. The club's executive director, Ben Carter, said about a dozen threatening messages were sent by email and posted on the group's website . 'Some crazy stuff,' he said. FBI spokesman Katherine Chaumont said: 'The . FBI is aware of the threats,' Chaumont said. 'If a violation of federal . law is determined, additional action or investigation as necessary will . take place.' The auction is being held amid tightened security as part of the club's three-day annual convention in Dallas, which is expected to draw about 45,000 people. The group announced in October that . it would auction the permit, one of only five offered annually by . Namibia. The permit is also the first to be made available for purchase . outside of that country. An . estimated 4,000 black rhinos remain in the wild, down from 70,000 in . the 1960s. Nearly 1,800 are in Namibia, according to the safari club. Poachers long have targeted all species of rhino, primarily for its horn, which is valuable on the international black market. Made . of the protein keratin, the chief component in fingernails and hooves, . the horn has been used in carvings and for medicinal purposes, mostly in . Asia. The near-extinction of the species also has been attributed to . habitat loss. Mr Carter . said the permit could fetch $1 million. But organizers hope to at least . break the previous high bid for one of the Namibia permits, which is . $223,000. Wildlife groups have criticized . the promotion of a hunt targeting an endangered animal, but Mr Carter said . it's meant to cull aggressive rhinos in an effort to protect the larger . herd. A taxidermist touches up painting to an African elephant head, set up for the Dallas Safari Club's Convention and Sporting Expo . He said the Namibia hunt will focus on an older, nonbreeding male with a pattern of aggression toward other rhinos. Mr Carter said that wildlife experts say culling a herd is an acceptable habitat management practice. 'When you have the science and facts behind it, and people don't want to listen and just become emotional, you just wonder how people's brains work sometimes,' he said. Wayne Pacelle, president of the Humane Society of the United States, said culling a herd is acceptable for a population that's abundant, but not for a species on the federal endangered species list.

A mounted Kamchatka Brown Bear is rolled through the Omni Hotel as crews set up for the Dallas Safari Club Convention and Sporting Expo . 'We've had a standard for more than 40 years that you don't shoot an animal that's endangered,' he said Wednesday. Jeffrey Flocken, North American regional director of the Massachusetts-based International Fund for Animal Welfare, also said Wednesday that culling the herd is the wrong approach, given the limited number of black rhinos in existence. The better approach is to protect the rhino by establishing a secure habitat that welcomes the paying public to view the animal, he said. 'This auction is telling the world that an American will pay anything to kill their species,' Flocken said. 'This is, in fact, making a spectacle of killing an endangered species.'","FBI reviewing multiple threats made against members of Dallas Safari Club .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A theater in Salt Lake City, Utah, has won praise for its response to a letter from a mother who complained about a kissing scene between two male characters. The unnamed woman, who visited the Pioneer Theatre Company with her teenage son, called a performance of the 1978 play Deathtrap ‘offensive and vulgar’ and its kiss scene an ‘explicit, homosexual display’. But an eloquent response from the theater questions why she is more upset by the characters’ display of affection than their on-stage killing sprees. Speaking out: Chris Lino, the managing director of the Pioneer Theatre Company (left, next to artistic director Karen Azenberg) has written a letter in response to an angry patron . Chris Lino, the Pioneer Theatre . Company’s managing director, wrote: ‘You object to the kissing, but not . to the fact that they’re murderers? You are comfortable with your son . witnessing an enacted murder, but not a same-sex kiss? In both cases, . it’s just make-believe, but how is a play that depicts murder, whether . it’s a contemporary murder-mystery like Deathtrap or an immortal tragedy . like Macbeth, morally acceptable while the depiction of a fairly . innocuous, albeit same-sex kiss, is totally unacceptable?’ He offered to refund the woman for her tickets and said that he would place a ‘do not contact’ tag on her records. Mr Lino, who posted both the woman’s letter and his response to the company’s Facebook page, has been applauded for his words. His . response was hailed as ‘perfect’ by commenters and ‘beautifully . handled’, while others pointed out that the woman could have easily . researched the plot synopsis prior to attending with her son.

"By . Sara Malm . A father has spent nearly two decades unable to feel excited or sad, after a freak motorbike accident in his youth left him brain damaged. Army veteran Matthew Rhodes, 39, from Tarleton, Lancashire, was just 20 when he was hit by a car while stationed in Germany. Although he has since married and had a son and daughter, Mr Rhodes has not been able to feel excitement since the accident. This is because his injuries damaged the part of the brain that deals with emotion. Long way back: Since Matthew Rhodes, 39, pictured with children Bethany, 11, and Harry, seven, was hit on his motorbike aged 20, he has been unable to feel excitement or sadness . Mr Rhodes suffered severe head injuries in the accident in 1995 and spent the following ten weeks in a coma. The former soldier was left virtually blind, semi-paralysed and the part of his brain which deals with emotion was almost wiped out. Despite doctors saying he would never walk again, he has since had a remarkable recovery and in 2000, met his wife Michelle, now 45 - although due to his short term memory loss it took him a year-and-a-half to remember her name. Mr Rhodes said: ‘I still struggle with names - I even get my children’s names  mixed up all the time. I am fine with numbers, but names and places I just can’t remember.’ Happy, but not excited: Mr Rhodes med Michelle five years after the accident, but was not struck by nerves on his wedding day in 2002 . ‘And when I came out of my coma I was talking gobbledegook, but to me it sounded like perfect English. The couple married in 2000, and have since had two children, Bethany, 11, and Harry, seven. But neither his wedding day or the birth of his children sent Mr Rhodes on to the roller-coaster of emotion most people would experience. He has now written about his experiences in his book called Never Say Die and raises money for charity Blind Veterans UK. Mr Rhodes said: ‘People say that I am very ""one level"", especially in my facial expression. 'I’m never bothered by much, just very relaxed. I don’t get excited, ecstatic, or desperately sad - I just have one level now. Calm life: Mr Rhodes is more interested in spending time with his family and painting than the thrills of soldier life . ‘I never had a proper laugh, I’m just quite nonplussed about things.’ With the support of his family, he has defied doctors who said he wouldn’t walk again and through gruelling physiotherapy, has regained some mobility. The limbic system is the collective name for structures in the human brain involved in emotion, motivation, and emotional association with memory. There are several main parts of this system, including the hippocampus - the memory centre - and amygdala - the fear centre and the hippocampus. Damage to the limbic system can severely affect a person's memory and emotional response to events, . Luke Griggs, spokesperson for Headway, . the brain injury association, said: ‘A brain injury can effect . everything we do, think and feel. ‘The . emotional and behavioural impact of brain injuries can be devastating . for individuals and families alike and can include an inability to . control anger and irritability, a lack of empathy and a general lack . control over one's emotions. ‘Recognising and understanding these changes is a vital part of rebuilding one's life after brain injury.’ Mr Rhodes said: ‘I just crack on with . things, there is no point letting it get me down. 'When I was a soldier I . would say I would rather be dead than disabled, but now I see how . foolish I was. ‘Since my accident I have married my wife and had two fantastic children, whom I love dearly.' Mr . Rhodes expresses himself through painting, and despite having limited . vision, he has learnt how to paint with the help of charity Blind . Veterans. But although he has worked hard to overcome his physical disabilities, he has found his emotions stay the same. His wedding to Michelle, for example, was somewhat subdued experience. Mr Rhodes said: ‘It was a fantastic . day and the weather was beautiful but beforehand I didn’t have . excitement for it. It’s just part of who I am now, to have emotions on . one level.’ Mr Rhodes, a . former soldier in the 1st Battalion Devonshire and Dorset regiment, had a . glittering career in the army ahead of him. He . served in Germany, Canada and did a tour of Bosnia, was one of the . fittest in his regiment and was the top gunner for the Infantry tank. Back in the days: A collect of Matthew Rhodes in the army, before he suffered the motorbike accident in 1995 . Mr Rhodes has served as a part of the NATO forces in Bosnia and was stationed in Germany at the time of the accident . Family man: Mr Rhodes, pictured with son Harry in hospital, says that although he adores his family, he does not get excited about things like theme parks, travel or birthdays . Mr Rhodes was lucky to survive the accident and while he was in a coma his weight dropped from 12 stone to five-and-a-half. Mr . Rhodes said: ‘I am paralysed on the right hand side from my nose to my . toes but even though the doctors said I would never walk again I have . proved them wrong.’ He no longer uses a wheelchair - instead, his right leg is encased in a . plaster cast, but he is able to walk around and has even completed the . London marathon, in one day and ten hours. He has also accepted that he won’t experience the same highs and lows in life as other people do. ‘I . just get on with it. My children have given me a reason to live. 'When I . was in the army I travelled all over the world and was always kept . busy. ‘After my accident my life completely changed and I could no longer complete my ambition of rising up the ranks in the army. ‘But . now I have the kids, it gives me a task to do, a task which will always . be there and I’ll always be looking after my children no matter what . age they are.’ Blind Veterans UK, formerly St Dunstan’s, is the national charity for blind ex-Service men and women.

"By . Ellie Zolfagharifard . Scientists hope to send the first humans to Mars by 2025, but as it currently stands, anyone who takes a roundtrip mission to the red planet would be exposed to dangerously high levels of radiation. Experts estimate that the radiation would be enough to increase an astronaut’s lifetime risk of developing fatal cancer by more than three per cent. Other risks faced during long-term spaceflights include blindness and bone loss from the microgravity environment. Astronauts who takes a roundtrip mission to the red planet would be exposed to dangerously high levels of radiation, according to Nasa . Now a panel of scientists is urging Nasa to draft a clear set of ethical rules to ensure the health of astronauts on long-duration flights, according to Space.com. A report from the National Academy of Science's Institute of Medicine (IOM) argues that guidelines on exceptions to Nasa’s current health standards are needed. ‘From its inception, space exploration has pushed the boundaries [of human endurance] and risked the lives and health of astronauts,’ Jeffrey Kahn, chair of the IOM committee, said in a statement. Experts estimate that the radiation exposure on a trip to the red planet would be enough to increase an astronaut¿s lifetime risk of developing fatal cancer by more than three per cent . Avoid harm by preventing harm, exercising caution, and removing or mitigating harms that occur . A mission must provide benefits to society . Seek a favourable and acceptable balance of risk of harm and potential for benefit . Respect autonomy by allowing individual astronauts to make voluntary decisions regarding participation in proposed missions . Ensure fair processes and provide equality of opportunity for mission participation and crew selection . Recognise fidelity and the individual sacrifices made for the benefit of society by offering health care and protection for astronauts during missions and over the course of their lifetimes. ‘Determining where those boundaries lie and when to push the limits is complex. Nasa will continue to face decisions as technologies improve, and longer and farther spaceflights become feasible.’ The report says that ethical principles should include finding a balance between risk of harm and potential benefit to the society. It adds that Nasa should offer health care and protection for astronauts during missions and over the course of their lifetimes. According to Nasa, a mission to the red planet would take several years to complete and, during which time, astronauts would face health risks from cosmic rays and energetic particles from the sun. Both types of radiation can damage DNA and increase the risk of an astronaut developing cancer. On current missions in low-Earth orbit, astronauts are protected from the most harmful effects of the radiation as a result of Earth's magnetic field. This creates a shield around the planet that deflects much of the radiation. In deep space, however, astronauts will be without this protection. ‘Astronauts put their lives and health at great risk for their country and humankind,’ said Dr Kahn. ‘Our report builds on Nasa’s work and confirms the ethical imperative to protect astronauts' health, while fulfilling the agency's mission of exploration.’ Other risks on a mission to Mars include vision impairment and bone loss from the microgravity environment .","Trip to Mars would increase astronaut's risk of developing cancer by 3% .

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan . Most galaxies are thought to be large star-forming structures with millions or billions of stars. But the Segue 1 dwarf galaxy, 75,000 light-years from Earth, has astrophysicists scratching their heads. It contains just a few hundred stars and it hasn't produced any new ones in over 13 billion years, suggesting it may be a fossil left over from the young universe. The stars of the dwarf galaxy Segue 1, which may be one of the universe's first galaxies, are circled here . Researchers led by Anna Frebel of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, US recently published their measurements. Scientists believe the Big Bang gave rise to a universe filled with hydrogen, helium, and a trace. All the other elements that we see today were forged in . stars, which are born in clouds of gas and dust provided by supernovae — huge . stars that explode at the end of their life. This endless recycling process has yielded an intriguing . tool for astrophysicists. One way of determining stellar age is iron, whose content in . a star enriches with every successive birth. The lower the iron content in a star's light spectrum, the . older it is. They analysed data from the Las Campanas Observatory’s Magellan Telescopes in Chile and the Keck Observatory in Hawaii. What they found was that the stars in Segue 1 are made mostly of hydrogen and helium, with very little amounts of heavier elements like iron detected. This makes Segue 1 ‘the least chemically evolved galaxy known,’ the researchers say in their paper. Most galaxies go through periods of repeated star formation. When stars explode in supernovae, they release heavy elements that lead to the creation of new stars. The types of element released depends on the mass of the star. High-mass stars, which live for relatively short amounts of time, release elements like magnesium and calcium. Low-mass stars, on the other hand, live longer but release mostly iron. Now you see it: On the left is an image of the Segue 1 dwarf galaxy as imaged with other stars, where it is almost invisible. When the other stars are removed (right), the sparse galaxy starts to reveal itself . The stars in the Segue 1 galaxy only seem to contain products from high-mass stars. The researchers say this supports the idea ‘that it may be a surviving first galaxy that experienced only one burst of star formation.’ The reason for this is not known. It may be due to something known as the ‘epoch of reionisation’ that occurred 13.2 billion years ago, 600 million years after the Big Bang. In this period any existing galaxies would have lost their ability to make new stars. This would also explain why Segue 1 experienced only one brief spurt of star formation. The new data on Segue 1 was taken from observations made by the Las Campanas Observatory in Chile (pictured) and the Keck Observatory in Hawaii . Another unknown is whether galaxies can form this small, or whether they form larger and then have mass taken away. ‘This study is so interesting because I really want to know, can galaxies form this small?’ astronomer Beth Willman of Haverford College told Scientific American. ‘Can galaxies form and look like Segue 1 when they form or do they have to form larger and then have some mass taken away?’ ‘There could be 200 Segue 1-like galaxies around us.’ ‘My lifelong goal is trying to understand, are things like this the most abundant in the universe?' For now Segue 1 gives us a tantalising look at some of the first things to form in the universe. And it may provide us with some useful new information as to how some of the very first structures in the cosmos came to be.","Small galaxy circling Milky Way could be a fossil from the early universe .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . It is the exercise increasingly favoured by those fed up with public transport and looking to take more exercise. But riding a bike dramatically increases the risk of injury to the genitals and kidneys, a study has shown. Cycling, and in particular the bike itself, cause a worrying amount of kidney and genitalia injuries especially among children, researchers say. The study also found that 70 per cent of . bike-related injuries to the kidneys and genitals were a result of . direct contact with the bike, rather than falling off. On yer bike: Cycling fans run a risk of injuring kidneys and genitals, with 4,000 people admitted to A&E every year in the U.S. About 4,000 people visit U.S. emergency rooms for bicycle-related kidney and genital injuries each year, 61 per cent of which were males. In a study published in the journal Injury Prevention, researchers analysed data collected by the U.S.’s National Electronic Injury Surveillance System between 2002 and 2010. Children were found to have sustained about ten times as many of these types of injuries as adults. Still, adults' injuries more often required hospital admission. About 12 per cent of the adult ER visits in the study led to a hospital admission, compared to seven per cent of children's visits. About 70 per cent of injuries resulted from direct contact with the bike, and in nearly half of those injuries, the culprit was the top tube that runs between the seat and the handlebars. ‘We were surprised that there were so . many injuries related to bike riding,’ co-author Dr Benjamin Breyer, a . urologist at the University of California, San Francisco said. Careful contact: The study also found that 70 per cent of bike-related injuries to the kidneys and genitals were a result of direct contact with the bike, often the top tube that runs between the seat and the handlebars . Dr. Breyer and his team separated the patients by age group and looked at whether each person had been subsequently admitted to the hospital, which would indicate a relatively severe injury. They excluded injuries that had been caused by a collision with a car. Despite these data, the authors called the paper ‘exploratory,’ emphasizing that it shouldn't necessarily lead to changes in safety precautions. ‘Our data hasn't informed prevention strategies yet,’ said Breyer. Although changes in a bicycle's design could potentially prevent some injuries, ‘you can't figure that out with this kind of study,’ he said. Some experts argued that biking holds inherent risks, and that making changes to bicycles in light of so few major injuries isn't necessary. ‘Riding your bike safely is the most important thing. Wear a helmet, follow the rules of the road, and be alert and be visible,’ Breyer said.","Thousands admitted to A&E for bicycle-related kidney and genital injuries .

"By . Hilary Freeman . Patients with a severe type of arthritis associated with the skin condition psoriasis now have access to a drug that can ease pain and inflammation within a week. Cimzia has just been licensed for NHS patients with psoriatic arthritis. It is given to them as an injection and can be self-administered. Approximately 156,000 people in England and Wales suffer from the condition. The drug will be available for NHS patients with psoriatic arthritis. It is given to them as an injection and can be self-administered. Approximately 156,000 people in England and Wales suffer from the condition . A recent trial showed the medication rapidly improved joint swelling and skin symptoms in patients who were experiencing mild to severe psoriasis. About 10 to 20 per cent of the 1.8 million people in the UK with psoriasis go on to develop psoriatic arthritis, usually around ten years after the onset of skin problems. Stiffness in the back or neck and swelling of fingers or toes is often seen and in the worst cases joints fuse. Jo Cumming, Head of Information and Helplines at Arthritis Care, explains: ‘Some patients develop the arthritic symptoms before the psoriasis, while others never develop the skin condition. Jo Cumming, head of information and helplines at Arthritis Care explained that psoriatic arthritis could be hard to diagnose . 'It can be difficult to diagnose because the symptoms may be similar to those experienced by those with other forms of arthritis.’ Cimzia is an anti-tumour necrosis factor drug (anti-TNF). According to Consultant Rheumatologist, Dr Stefan Siebert, Senior Lecturer in Rheumatology at the University of Glasgow, it works by targeting one of the molecules involved in causing joint inflammation. ‘TNF is an inflammatory protein that circulates in the joints and causes damage over time. An anti-TNF sticks to it and disables it, stopping it going into the cells. 'Cimzia has an extra ‘peg’ side chain attached to it, which makes it work for longer. ‘Patients seem to have a quick and effective response, which is a huge positive to someone living with the emotional and psychological effects brought on by psoriatic arthritis. ‘We’re beginning to understand more about the genetics of this condition, and several new drugs are in the pipeline.’ To find out more click here to visit the Arthritis Care website .","Those with arthritis associated with skin condition will benefit from drug .

"By . Sara Malm . Ignored:  Peter Tizzard, 73, says his calls for assistance went unanswered at Dorset County Hospital . An elderly cancer patient claims he was forced to call 999 from his hospital bed after staff ignored his calls for help. Peter Tizzard, 73, was in the care of Dorset County Hospital when he suddenly experienced severe pain, and pressed his bedside call button and shouted out for assistance. Mr Tizzard, who suffers from prostate cancer, claims he saw no other way to get help, and used his mobile phone to make an emergency 999 call. The emergency operator called Mr Tizzard's ward at the Dorset County Hospital, and they sent a doctor to see him. Mr Tizzard says he does not blame the staff for not coming to his aid quickly enough, saying the ward was understaffed and the doctors and nurses ‘run ragged’. Mr Tizzard, from Weymouth, Dorset, said: ‘I kept shouting but no one came to see me. I don't know how long I was shouting for. ‘I thought, “what am I going to do?” Calling 999 was the only way someone was coming to help me. ‘I told the operator that I didn't want an ambulance - I just wanted to be wheeled down to A and E so I could be seen to. ‘All the nursing staff, the doctors, were wonderful - they just don't have enough staff. They're run ragged. ‘There were four nursing staff looking after between 28 and 34 people. How can you expect them to be able to do that?’ Dorset County Hospital denied that there were problems with staffing at the hospital on the night of the 29th March, and says that Mr Tizzard chose to dial 999 instead of using the call bell system. A spokeswoman said: ‘Lulworth Ward was . fully staffed that night and there were no problems with call bells . being answered in a timely way. ‘We understand that Mr Tizzard felt the ward was very busy and believed it would help staff if he dialled 999 and alerted emergency services rather than using the call bell system. Disagreement:  Dorset County Hospital says said the 999 operator called the Mr Tizzard's ward directly and they sent a doctor to see him, as there was no problem with staffing on the night in question . ‘We appreciate Mr Tizzard was trying to be helpful but this course of action was not necessary. ‘The ambulance service contacted the ward and the situation was explained. No ambulance was dispatched. ‘The matron and ward sister met with Mr Tizzard daily during his stay and ensured he was able to contact them directly if he felt he was not being attended to promptly enough. ‘We are really disappointed that Mr Tizzard felt it was necessary to take the action he did given the effort the ward staff and matron had taken to ensure he received good care.’ Last month, Dorset County hospitals were accused of wasting taxpayers’ money on 'non-jobs', after it emerged they employed a part-time ‘arts in hospital co-ordinator’ on a £30,000 salary. The investigation revealed that the NHS is spending £46million a year on non-jobs such as ‘play and communication workers’, ‘carbon managers’ and ‘car park environmental officers’.

"By . Mark Prigg . Google is working on a version of its Android software for televisioons, leaked screenshots have revealed. The firm previously tried to work with manufacturers, including Sony, on a range of Google TV boxes, which flopped. However, it appears the search giant is now planning a second assault on the living room to take on Apple, Amazon and the games consoles in the race to become the main living room gadget. Google's Play Store already has deals with all of the major studios in place . Yahoo and Microsoft have both revealed plans to create their own TV shows in the ever-expanding battle for the living room. Yahoo has unveiled plans for four shows, while Microsoft is believed to have 12 in development. They will go up against Amazon, Hulu and Netflix, all of whom are also commissioning their own shows in a bid to change they way we watch TV. According to documents obtained exclusively by The Verge, Google is about to launch a second attempt at a TV box. Major video app providers including Hulu, Netflix and Vevo already have apps running on the paltform, accoridnt o screenshots The Verge obtained. 'Android TV is an entertainment interface, not a computing platform,' writes Google. 'It’s all about finding and enjoying content with the least amount of friction. It will be 'cinematic, fun, fluid, and fast.' It comes just a week after Amazon revealed Fire, its TV set top box. It is unclear whether the Google system will include Amazon's Instant Video app. Experts say the company could still face problems by confusing customer who have already bought its Chromecast TV dongle, a $30 device that allows selected apps to show video on a TV. Google's TV homepage shows a menu system similar to Apple's TV box, with voice control. 'Android TV by the look of things is what Google TV should have been first time around, however is still likely to be met with confusion by customers already trying to understand Google Chromecast,' Stuart Miles of gadget website Pocket Lint told MailOnline. 'Google can’t ignore the move to the television as a way to enjoy connected content as company’s like Roku, Amazon, and Apple still continue to make strong inroads. The screenshots obtained by The Verge also shows apps on the platform, including Hulu, Netflix and Vevo.

"By . Sarah Griffiths . From powered exoskeleton races to competitions using brain power, the first ever Olympics for bionic athletes will take place in Switzerland in October 2016. The Cybathlon will include races for competitors wearing prosthetic limbs and exoskeletons as well as a powered wheelchair obstacle course and a competition where people control an avatar using their mind. As well as enabling bionic athletes to compete together, the Cybathlon is designed to boost interest in performance-enhancing technology used by humans. Scroll down for video . From powered exoskeleton races to competitions using brain power (illustrated), the first Olympics for bionic athletes, called the Cybathlon, will take place in Switzerland in October 2016 . Some of the technology that will be put through its paces by athletes has previously been excluded from the Paralympics. The event, which will be hosted by the Swiss National Competence Centre of Research (NCCR) will include a race for competitors who are paralysed from the neck down, where they control an avatar in a computer game using a headset that links their brain to the computer. ‘The competitions are comprised by different disciplines that apply the most modern powered knee prostheses, wearable arm prostheses, powered exoskeletons, powered wheelchairs, electrically stimulated muscles and novel brain-computer interfaces,’ the NCCR said. The wearers of the assistive devices will be known as pilots and the technology they use can be available commercially or developed for them as a prototype in a lab. Pilots with leg amputation will be equipped with machine operated prostheses and will have to successfully complete a race course (pictured) as quickly as possible, which will include obstacles such as slopes, a staircase, cobblestones and a seesaw . In the Powered Exoskeleton Race (pictured), pilots with complete thoracic or lumbar Spinal Cord Injuries (SCI) will be equipped with actuated exoskeletal devices, which will enable them to walk along a particular race course . In a slightly similar way to Formula One, both the pilot and company that has developed the device will receive a medal at the event at the Hallenstadion Zurich. While prosthetic limbs are becoming increasingly advanced, there is often a disconnect between patients and the technology they use, according to Professor Robert Riener, the organiser of the event from the University of Switzerland. Pilots with forearm or upper arm amputations will be equipped with actuated exoprosthetic devices and will have to successfully complete two hand-arm task courses as quickly as possible (illustrated). A close-up camera view will be used to life-display the shoot on the stadium screens. At least two participants will start at the same time on two identical courses, to make the event more exciting . The wearers of the assistive devices will be known as pilots and the technology they use can be available commercially or developed for them as a prototype in a lab. A bionic hand called the iLimb, which is commercially available from Touch Bionics is pictured . ‘The idea is that we want to push development of assistive technologies towards devices that patients can really use in everyday life,’ he told the BBC. ‘Some of the current technologies look very fancy but are a long way from being practical and user-friendly.’ The Powered Wheelchair Race (illustrated) will allow pilots with different disability levels (e.g. quadriplegics, paraplegics, amputees) to be equipped with power wheelchairs, which will enable them to steer along a particular race course. The course will be defined by cones between which the pilots will have to manoeuvre the chair both forward and backward. In addition, obstacles of different sizes will be used . Pilots with arm amputations will be equipped with robotic prostheses and will have to successfully complete two hand-arm task courses as quickly as possible, including a course where they try not to touch a wire with a metal hoop (pictured) Powered arm prostheses race: Pilots with arm amputations will be equipped with robotic prostheses and will have to successfully complete two hand-arm task courses as quickly as possible. One of the challenges will see pilots holding a wire loop which they will use to navigate a metal wire without touching it. Another race will see participants pick up differently shaped objects in order to demonstrate the dexterity of their prostheses. Brain computer interface race: Pilots will be equipped with technology that lets them control an avatar in a racing game played on computers using their brains. They will race along a track with obstacles. Functional electrical stimulation bike race: Pilots with spinal cord injuries will use functional electrical stimulation devices, which will enable them to perform a pedaling movement on a cycling device that drives them on a circular course. There will be two categories - a sprint race, over a distance of 200metres and an endurance race over the distance of 1000metres. Powered leg prostheses race: Pilots with transfemoral amputation will be equipped with machine operated prostheses and will have to successfully complete a race course as quickly as possible, which will include obstacles such as slopes, a staircase, cobblestones and seesaw. Powered exoskelton race: Pilots with spinal cord injuries (SCI) will use powered exoskeletons to negotiate a race course with obstacles of around 100metres. Powered wheelchair race: Participants will use powered wheelchairs to steer along a race course with slopes and uneven surfaces as well as a slalom.

"By . Victoria Woollaston . It's been four months since reports of a reversible USB plug started doing the rounds, and the project just took a step forward as images of the cable surfaced online. The artist's renderings, created by Taiwanese manufacturer Foxconn, show what the new cables will look like, and how the ports on the side of electronic devices are set to change. Called the USB Type-C connector, it has been designed for use with thinner, sleeker devices, such as tablets and ultrabooks, and solves the annoying problem of inserting drives the wrong way up. The images, pictured, created by Taiwanese manufacturer Foxconn, show what the new reversible cables could look like. The Type-C connector is built on existing USB 3.1 and USB 2.0 technologies. Captions on the images state they are 'artist renderings courtesy of Foxconn' and 'final designs are subject to change' The USB Type-C connector has been . designed for use with thinner, sleeker devices, such as tablets and . ultrabooks. It is being built on existing USB 3.1 and USB 2.0 technologies. The plug is smaller than current laptop connectors, and more closely resembles the size of the current Micro USB. Crucially, it will be reversible meaning it will work whichever way it is plugged in. This is similar to how Apple's Lightning connector works. The USB 2.0 specification was released in 2000 and became the standard by the end of 2001, followed by USB 3.0 in 2008, and 3.1 in July 2013. Apple uses its own Lightning Connector on newer models of iPhone and iPads, which can be inserted either way up. The Type-C connector will work in a similar way, while resembling the size of the current Micro USB plug. According to the USB 3.0 Promoter Group, the Type-C will be ‘the only connector one will need across all devices.’ Crucially, however, as the new design is different to the current versions of USB plugs, users of older computing equipment will need an adapter to use the new plugs. The USB Type-C connector, artist's impression pictured, has been designed for use with thinner, sleeker devices, such as tablets and ultrabooks. The design and full specifications have not been released yet, but the final design is expected by the summer . Brad Saunders, chairman of the promoter group, said the plug is being developed ‘to help enable thinner and sleeker product designs, enhance usability and provide a growth path for performance enhancements for future versions of USB.' The Type-C connector is built on existing USB 3.1 and USB 2.0 technologies. Captions on the images state they are 'artist renderings courtesy of Foxconn' and 'final designs are subject to change.'

Scientists have questioned Miley Cyrus's ability to arrive 'like a wrecking ball' - pointing out she would have to travel at  over 316 mph to cause a similar impact, and risk death in the process. A science student carried out the analysis, warning 'any human behaving like a wrecking ball would likely result in serious injury.'

Are you sure Miley? Scientists have questioned Miley Cyrus's ability to arrive 'like a wrecking ball' Students analysed the movement of a wrecking ball to find how fast a human would need to move to recreate its effects . The study, called 'The viability of arriving like a wrecking ball' was carried out by third-year natural sciences student David McDonagh from The Centre for Interdisciplinary Science at University of Leicester. 'A pop song that made the charts in late  2013 alludes to the idea of entering a given location analogous to a wrecking ball, raising questions over if such a feat is possible,' he wrote. 'Perhaps more  significantly,  the singer claims to have impacted both love and ostensibly the walls of someoneâ€™s house with similar momentum at some point, providing a somewhat unique case in studying the effects of shock on human beings.'

"By . Chris Pleasance . UN General Secretary Ban Ki-Moon has spoken of the 'shame' that fell on his organisation for failing to act against the Rwandan genocide as the African nation marks the 20th anniversary of the tragedy. Over the course of 100 days, starting on April 6, 1994, nearly 800,000 ethnic Tutsis were killed by Hutu extremists as they tried to eradicate the minority group. The international community, including the UN, were accused of deliberately ignoring events and of failing to intervene, despite warnings from peacekeepers within the country that genocide was taking place. Scroll down for video . UN general Secretary Ban Ki-Moon, who was in Rwanda today to take part in ceremonies commemorating the 20th anniversary of the country's genocide, as spoken of the UN's 'shame' over failing to act . Ceremonies in the capital Kigali were led by President Paul Kagame, who came to power as the genocide ended . Kagame and Ban light a torch at the genocide memorial in the capital, which will burn for 100 days to mark the number of days the genocide attacks lasted for . Speaking at events in the capital Kigali, Ban said: 'Many United Nations personnel and others showed remarkable bravery. The . Rwandan genocide started on April 6, 1994, when President Habarimana's . plane was shot down over the capital Kigali. His death brought years of ethnic tensions to the surface, with extremist Hutus starting a planned campaign of extermination against the minority Tutsis. Over the next 100 days 800,000 Tutsis were killed, alongside thousands of Hutu moderates who objected. The killings only stopped when the Tutsi-controlled Rwandan Patriotic Front seized control, and put Paul Kagame into power. The international community, and the UN, were criticised for failing to act, despite warnings from inside the country that genocide was taking place. 'But we could have done much more. We should have done much more. In Rwanda, troops were withdrawn when they were most needed.' 'One year later in Srebrenica, areas proclaimed 'safe' by the United Nations were filled with danger, and innocents were abandoned to slaughter. The shame still clings, a generation after the events.' He added that the genocide was 'one of the darkest chapters in human history'. Official mourning began three months ago with a flame of remembrance touring towns and villages across the small nation, and culminated on Monday when the torch arrived at the national genocide memorial - where the remains of a quarter of a million people are stored in vast concrete tombs. President Paul Kagame lit a flame that will burn for 100 days, the length of time it took soldiers and militiamen to carry out their plan to wipe out the 'Inyenzi' - a term meaning 'cockroaches' - that was used by extremists to designate minority Tutsis and Hutu moderates. The slaughter only stopped after the Tutsi-controlled RPF seized power, installing Kagame as leader. At the national stadium, survivors of the genocide recounted their memories of the killings and of survival. Several people were overcome with trauma, screaming and crying uncontrollably with medical staff helping to carry them out and to provide counselling. Performers re-enacted events from the massacre which saw 800,000 minority Tutsis - three quarters of the population - killed in just 100 days starting on April 6, 1994 . As the ceremonies took place, there were cries and screams from the audience and several had to be treated by medics as painful memories flooded back . 'It is the day when the faces of all those I loved and died come back,' said Marie Muresyankwano, a mother in her thirties, saying that she would spend time 'with my own thoughts'. 'It is so hard for the people, because it opens mental wounds, hearing the testimonies of those who survived, they are reminded of what happened to them,' a Rwandan health ministry official said. The commemorations were also attended by former UK Prime Minister Tony Blair, who advises President Kagame through his Africa Governance Initiative foundation. French officials, however, were absent, with French Justice Minister Christiane Taubira having pulled out over the weekend after Kagame repeated his accusation of French 'participation' in the genocide. Several spectators had to be carried from the national stadium as they recalled the horrific events . Staff were on hand to provide counseling and support as remembrance ceremonies took place . Former Prime Minister Tony Blair, who has close links to Kagame through his Africa Governance Initiative foundation also attended the ceremony alongside former South African president Thabo Mbeki . Kagame said in an interview that French soldiers - who helped train the Hutu-controlled Rwandan army prior to 1994, as well as being accused of aiding the killers to escape - were both accomplices and 'actors' in the bloodbath. France's ambassador to Kigali, Michel Flesch, said that he had been telephoned overnight and told he was no longer welcome at the ceremonies. French authorities have repeatedly denied any direct involvement in the genocide, and, unlike former colonial power Belgium, have refused to apologise. In his speech at the stadium, Kagame took another thinly-veiled swipe at France, saying it was impossible to 'change the facts', and drawing loud applause. Kagame is a controversial figure. He has helped Rwanda to become one of the most economically stable countries in Africa, but is also accused of human rights violations . During the genocide 800,000 Tutsis were killed by extremist Hutus over the course of 100 days. The killing only stopped after the RPF seized power and installed Kagame as leader . But he said Rwandans should also celebrate the remarkable progress made in the past 20 years. Kagame has led Rwanda since his then-rebel force ousted Hutu extremists, steering a business-friendly and zero-corruption policy - although he has also come in for fierce criticism over his refusal to tolerate dissent and his alleged backing of rebels in neighbouring DR Congo. 'Today we have a reason to celebrate the normal moments of life, that are easy for others to take for granted. If the genocide reveals humanity's shocking capacity for human cruelty, Rwanda's choices show its capacity for renewal,' Kagame said. Tony Blair today in the Rwandan capital of Kigali. Blair has close ties with the country's controversial President Paul Kagame through his Africa governance Initiative foundation . Tony Blair attended the commemoration ceremonies in the Rwandan capital of Kigali today, and was pictured paying his respects to the 800,000 killed. The former PM has close ties to Rwanda and its President, Paul Kagame, through his Africa Governance Initiative foundation, which provides advice to African leaders. Writing in today's Guardian, Blair has defended Kagame's time in power, saying he brought the small nation back from the brink in the wake of the atrocities committed in the mid-1990s. Rwanda, he points out, is growing economically, is attracting foreign investment and provides a good level of healthcare to its citizens. Elsewhere Rwanda's government has been described as the least corrupt in Africa by Berlin-based Transparency International. However, Kagame, who was installed in power after the Tutsi controlled RPF seized control of the country following the genocide, is a highly controversial figure. While his economic policies may be producing results, his human rights record has drawn strong criticism. When Hutu extremists fled Rwanda to the neighbouring Democratic republic of Congo, or Zaire as it was then known, RPF soldiers pursued them, starting a chain of attacks and counter-attacks that have left millions dead. Twice Rwanda has invaded the country outright, in September 1996 and again beginning in August 1998. Kagame's supporters have also been implicated in attacks on opposition politicians and journalists. In the run-up to the last election in 2010, which Kagame won, Amnesty International condemned the widespread violence across the country, during which one political leader was beheaded. In 2001 Pasteur Bizimungu, a Hutu, tried to organise a political party to run against Kagame, but it was declared radical and Bizimungu was sentenced to 15 years in jail, though he was pardoned in 2007. The same happened again in 2010 when Victoire Ingabire, a female politician, returned from 16 years in exile to run for president. After a speech at the national genocide memorial, in which she was critical of the fact that no Hutu victims were remembered there, she was accused of 'genocide ideology' and arrested. During her trial, Kagame publicly declared her guilty.","Rwanda holds ceremonies to mark 20th anniversary of genocide in country .

"By . Ellie Zolfagharifard . Nasa has unveiled incredible footage of what it describes as a ‘graceful’ solar flare erupting from the sun's surface. The mid-level solar flare erupted on Wednesday April 2, peaking at 2:05pm GMT (10:05am EDT) with Nasa’s Solar Dynamics Observatory capturing the event. Solar flares are powerful bursts of radiation from the sun. Harmful radiation from a flare cannot pass through Earth's atmosphere to physically affect humans on the ground. Scroll down for video... A solar flare occurs when magnetic energy that has built up in the solar atmosphere is suddenly released. Radiation . is emitted across virtually the entire electromagnetic spectrum, from . radio waves at the long wavelength end, through optical emission to X-rays and gamma rays at the short wavelength end. The amount of energy released is the equivalent of millions of 100-megaton hydrogen bombs exploding at the same time . A . flare occurs when magnetic energy that has built up in the solar . atmosphere is suddenly released - mostly in the active regions around . sunspots. Their frequency varies from several a day, when the sun is particularly active, to less than one a week during quiet periods. However, when intense enough, they can disturb the atmosphere in the layer where GPS and communications signals travel. This particular flare, classified as an M6.5 flare, is not thought to have caused significant disturbance on Earth. M-class flares are ten times less powerful than the most intense flares, which are labelled X-class. The number after the M provides more information about its strength. An M2 is twice as intense as an M1 and an M3 is three times as intense. The mid-level solar flare erupted on Wednesday April 2, peaking at 2:05pm GMT (10:05am EDT) with Nasa's Solar Dynamics Observatory capturing the event . Solar flares can damage satellites and have an enormous financial cost. Astronauts . are not in immediate danger because of the relatively low orbit of this . manned mission. They do have to be concerned about cumulative exposure . during space walks. The charged particles can also threaten airlines by disturbing the Earth’s magnetic field. Very large flares can even create currents within electricity grids and knock out energy supplies. A positive aspect, from an aesthetic point of view, is that the auroras are enhanced. Geomagnetic . storms are more disruptive now than in the past because of our greater . dependence on technical systems that can be affected by electric . currents. On March 29, the sun unleashed a massive X-class solar flare causing a brief radio disturbance while generating a series of coronal mass ejections (CMEs). CMEs are powerful plasma eruptions near the surface of the sun driven by kinks in the solar magnetic field. Earlier this month, scientists came a step closer to understanding this powerful phenomenon behind solar flares by witnessing, for the first time, the mechanism behind it. Footage put together by an international team led by University of Cambridge researchers showed entangled magnetic field lines looping from the sun’s surface. These magnetic lines slip around each other and lead to an eruption 35 times the size of the Earth and an explosive release of magnetic energy into space. The discoveries of a gigantic energy build-up have brought scientists a step closer to predicting when and where large flares will occur. Solar flares are powerful bursts of radiation. Nasa claims harmful radiation from a flare cannot pass through Earth's atmosphere to physically affect humans on the ground . ‘We care about this as during flares we can have CMEs and sometimes they are sent in our direction,’ said lead author, Dr Jaroslav Dudik from Cambridge University. ‘Human civilisation is nowadays maintained by technology and that technology is vulnerable to space weather.' ‘Indeed, coronal mass ejections can damage satellites and therefore have an enormous financial cost.’ ‘They can also threaten airlines by disturbing the Earth’s magnetic field. Very large flares can even create currents within electricity grids and knock out energy supplies.’","M-class flare erupted on April 2 peaking at 2:05pm GMT (10:05am EDT)

"By . Mark Prigg . Nest Labs, the maker of smart thermostats that Google Inc acquired for $3.2 billion, has been forced to stop sales of its smoke alarm. Test founds users could potentially turn off the sensor unintentionally with a wave of the hand. The firm warned existing users to switch off the 'gesture control' feature while it worked on a fix. The $129 Nest Protect sensor, which was pulled from sale today after the firm admitted a wave of the hand could switch it off under some circumstances . The Nest Protect has Smoke and Carbon Monoxide sensors built in, along with a computer with wifi connection. It speaks to owners, telling them where the danger is and what the problem is. Before it sounds a piercing alarm, Nest Protect gives you a friendly Heads-Up warning that you can silence with a wave of your hand - until now. It integrates with your mobile devices and even messages you if the batteries run low, avoiding that all-too-familiar midnight low-battery chirp. Nest co-founder and Chief Executive Tony Faddell said that, under a unique set of circumstances the alarm's 'Nest Wave' feature, which allows a user to switch off the device with a wave of the hand, could be inadvertently activated. Faddell, one of the creators of Apple Inc's iPod, apologized in the blogpost for a problem that was discovered during recent laboratory testing. He added that no customer had complained so far. 'We observed a unique combination of circumstances that caused us to question whether the Nest Wave could be unintentionally activated,' he wrote. 'This could delay an alarm going off if there was a real fire,' he said. 'The fact that it could even potentially happen is extremely important to me and I want to address it immediately.' He did not specify that set of circumstances. The sensor can be controlled with an app - or by gesture control . The firm proudly showed off the gesture feature at launch - but will now disable it . Nest will immediately disable the Wave feature - one of many innovative design elements that has won the company and its devices acclaim - in all smoke alarms that are WiFi-connected while it works on a software update to fix the possible defect. It said the fix, plus regulatory approvals, could take two to three months to complete. Customers without WiFi-connected devices should either disable it or return it for a full refund, the company added. Nest halted all sales of its smoke alarms to prevent customers from buying a device that would need an immediate software patch. Google announced plans in January to acquire Nest via its second largest deal, to expand into a broader array of devices and bring valuable hardware design expertise in-house. Nest gained a large following with its first thermostat - a round, brushed-metal device with a convex screen that displays temperature and changes hue to match the color of the wall it attaches to.

"By . Jonathan O'callaghan . Babies are known for putting anything and everything in their mouths, from Lego to crayons. But a study suggests that this isn't necessarily a misbehaving habit, but rather a brain mechanism wired from birth. Research performed by the Institute of Cognitive Sciences in Bron, France, points to a 'survival of the fittest' mentality that ensures the baby survives even when other sensors haven't developed. Researchers suggest that a baby's habit of putting things in its mouth is a cognitive ability learned in the womb . A drug known as Donepezil, used to improve memory function in Alzehimer's patients, has found another use as a brain stimulant for adults. Researchers at Harvard University found that the drug can revert adult brains to the quick-learning phase of children's brains. It increases the elasticity of the brain, making it capable of learning rapidly in these 'critical periods'. The drug was used to successfully rewire a visually impaired patient's brain to process images. To investigate this human trait,  Director of Neuropsychology Angela Sirigu and her team studied 26 patients who were undergoing brain surgery. While unconscious, they were able to make nine of the patients move their hands to their mouths by stimulating regions of the brain known to perform these actions. The fact that this behaviour is programmed into the same region of the brain in every person suggests that it is most likely an ability present in our brains before birth. If it was a learned skill, different regions of the brain would be involved in performing the action and it would change between individuals, but this was not the case. By stimulating sections of the brain, the researchers were able to make nine of 26 brain surgery patients unconsciously move their hands to their mouths, suggesting such a movement is wired into our brains . This suggests that our motion of moving our hands to our mouths, perhaps to consistently supply us with food from a young age, is something that is wired into the circuitry of the brain. Even when in the womb, foetuses are known to suck their thumbs, a precursor action to actually putting food into their mouths. 'If you've ever looked at a newborn primate's brain or a baby's brain, it's surprising that they work at all,' Jon Kaas, a neuroscientist at Vanderbilt University in Tennessee, US told New Scientist. 'The neurons aren't mature and the consistency of the brain is sort of like pudding. 'But some things have to work right away.'","Babies have a habit of picking things up and putting them in their mouths .

"By . Bianca London . She's built up a successful diet and exercise brand, as well as her very own 'Booty Camp', in the wake of her departure from The Only Way Is Essex late last year. And now Lucy Mecklenburgh is also proving her worth as a model, too. The former TOWIE star is helping Superdrug celebrate a milestone as it reaches its 50th birthday. Scroll down for video . What a difference! Lucy Mecklenburgh has been treated to a series of makeovers from the past 50 years to celebrate Superdrug's 50th birthday. Speaking about this 80s material girl look, she said: 'I love the funky thick black eyeliner - this is actually a really cool look' To celebrate, DARE, Superdrug’s customer magazine, worked with Lucy to recreate five iconic looks from the last fifty years of beauty. The 22-year-old was given a 60s Twiggy-inspired makeover, a 70s disco look, as well as 80s material girl, 90s 'fresh' and a modern-day bronzed beauty. Speaking about the shoot, Lucy said: 'My favourite look today has definitely been the 1960s Twiggy look, I love it. I love this style and have always wanted to try Twiggy eye make-up.' Lucy said the 70s disco look made her feel 'really glamorous' and described the 80s look as 'really cool.' 70s disco: Lucy said of this look: 'The metallic eyes and strong red lips make me feel really glamorous!' 90s fresh: Speaking about her urban makeover, Lucy said: 'I like this look.  Everything I need to create it is already in my make-up bag' 'I actually liked all of them,' she added. 'Today’s 'bronzed beauty' is how I wear my make-up now. I also like being bronzed a la Kim Kardashian.' Charmian Harris, editor of DARE Magazine said: 'Working with Lucy on this shoot was loads of fun, she loves beauty and was involved in styling the looks to give her own unique interpretation of beauty through the decades.' Aside from her modelling duties, Lucy was seen relaxing on the beach in Dubai earlier this month. Slipping . into a skimpy white bikini, the 22-year-old reality star displayed her . killer tan and envy-inducing hourglass curves as she soaked up the sun . in the Middle Eastern holiday hotspot. Lucy threw herself into a . vigorous diet and exercise regime in the wake of her painful split from . co-star fiance, Mario Falcone, last April. Best beauty look: Speaking about the shoot, Lucy said: 'My favourite look today has definitely been the 1960s Twiggy look, I love it. I love this style and have always wanted to try Twiggy eye make-up' Bronze babe: 'Today's bronzed beauty is how I wear my make-up now. I also like being bronzed a la Kim Kardashian' said Lucy of this contemporary look . But the svelte 9st 5ft 6in star has since admitted she got 'too skinny' at one point. She . said: 'When I started training for the first time last January, . exercise started out as the thing that made me happy at a time when I . felt sad. It got me out the other end. 'I still love exercise but, back then, it was more of an addiction and, at one point, I was too thin.' She . recently told MailOnline of her healthy approach to life: 'I think it's . normal for people to lose weight through anxiety after a break-up. I . would just advise women to not overdo it. I feel more confident, I am aware of what I eat and I have so much more energy.' Trim figure: Lucy, pictured left at last night's F&F show and, right, showcasing the fruits of her labour on the beach in Dubai . Her typical daily diet now consists . of eggs with smoked salmon for breakfast, sushi or salad for lunch and . fish or meat with quinoa and vegetables for dinner, all washed down with . lots of peppermint tea. Reminding . us that she's still mortal, Lucy has a treat day and loves a huge bowl . of spaghetti bolognaise with lots of cheese, as well as a piece of apple . crumble or chocolate brownie with her Sunday roast dinner. She . added: 'I love going for drinks with the girls, it's how I relax after a . long day. I just opt for vodka and steer clear of sugary cocktails. 'We need to realise that we are just addicted to sugar, we don't need it. I banned it for two weeks and never craved it again.'

"By . Victoria Woollaston . Following reports that billions of bee colonies across the world are facing extinction, a team of designers have decided to take matters into their own hands. The Open Source Beehives project has been set up so beekeepers - both amateur and professional - can print and assemble smart hives that monitor and track the health of bee colonies globally. The hives are sold either on their own, or with a sensory kit that sends data to an open platform called Smartcitizen. This data is then analysed by experts in a bid to find a solution to the decreasing bee populations. The Open Source Beehive project has been set up so beekeepers - both amateur and professional - can print and assemble smart beehives that monitor and track the health of colonies. The design of the open-source hive, pictured, is based on the traditional design of the Warre Hive . A team of Australian scientists plan to mount tiny sensors to 5,000 honey bees and monitor where they fly. The plan will be the first of its kind to track bees as they move in real-time. The sensors use radio frequency identification chips and would record when the bee passes a certain point. This data would then be sent back to Australia's Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation to be analysed. This sensory kit was developed by Fab Lab . Barcelona and is an open source platform, including hardware, a website and an app. The designs of the open-source hives are based on the traditional look of the Warre Hive, or People’s Hive. It is built by adding hives boxes to the bottom of the structure - rather than the top - to encourage bees to build down. This is how they typically create their hives in the wild. The parts of the open-source hives are printed on a 3D printer and are shipped in flatpack boxes before being assembled.

The parts of the open-source hives are printed on a 3D printer and are shipped in flatpack boxes before being assembled . All the sections then slot together, removing the need for potentially harmful screws and glue. The designs for the hives, called the Colorado Top Bar and the Barcelona Warre, are also downloadable and available from the project’s Indiegogo campaign. This means anyone with their own 3D printer can produce their own range of hives at home. ‘These hives aim to prioritise bee colony health, make beekeeping more accessible and will ultimately allow you to log and study the health of your colony,’ said the designers. The hives are sold either on their own, or with a sensory kit, pictured, that sends data to an open platform called Smartcitizen. This sensory kit was developed by Fab Lab Barcelona and includes hardware, a website and an app . The data sent to the Smartcitizen platform, plus the geolocation tags, are used to compare and analyse the hives to help prevent decreasing bee populations.

For $100 (£60), Indiegogo investors receive a Mini-Hive kit sold with a miniature laser-cut beehive and the download kit. The download kit on its own costs $15 (£9). The full-sized hives cost $300 (£180) without sensors, or $600 (£361) with the full Smartcitizen pack.

"By . Ellie Zolfagharifard . The sun unleashed a massive X-class solar flare over the weekend which could result in spectacular auroras on Earth tomorrow. The solar flare peaked at 5:48pm GMT (1:48 pm EDT) on Saturday March 29 causing a brief radio disturbance while generating a series of coronal mass ejections (CMEs). CMEs are powerful plasma eruptions near the surface of the sun driven by kinks in the solar magnetic field. Scroll down for video... Extreme ultraviolet light streams out of an X-class solar flare as seen in this image captured on March 29, 2014, by Nasa's Solar Dynamics Observatory . The CMEs will graze Earth tomorrow causing a possible geomagnetic storm that will create auroras. It is not yet clear where auroras will be seen, but it is thought that people living at higher latitudes will be most likely to spot a light show if one emerges. Scientists, however, believe it will only deliver a ‘glancing blow’ and will not seriously affect communication systems. ‘The best-guess forecast calls for minor G1-class storms. High-latitude sky watchers should be alert for auroras,' wrote SpaceWeather.com. Watch the X-class solar flare in action . Solar flares can damage satellites and have an enormous financial cost. Astronauts are not in immediate danger because of the relatively low orbit of this manned mission. They do have to be concerned about cumulative exposure during space walks. The charged particles can also threaten airlines by disturbing the Earth’s magnetic field. Very large flares can even create currents within electricity grids and knock out energy supplies. A positive aspect, from an aesthetic point of view, is that the auroras are enhanced. Geomagnetic storms are more disruptive now than in the past because of our greater dependence on technical systems that can be affected by electric currents. As well as blacking out some radio signals for about an hour over the weekend, the solar flare produced radio signals of its own, according to SpaceWeather.com. ‘The explosion above sunspot AR2017 sent shock waves racing through the Sun's atmosphere at speeds as high as 11 million mph (4800 km/s),’ it said. ‘Radio emissions stimulated by those shocks crossed the 93 million mile divide to Earth, causing shortwave radio receivers to roar with static.’ Sunspot AR2017, that contained the flare, was active over the weekend, producing three solar flares in total. In addition to the X-class solar flare on March 29, two M-class solar flares erupted from the region on March 28 and March 30. Solar flares are powerful bursts of radiation. Harmful radiation from a flare cannot pass through Earth's atmosphere to physically affect humans on the ground. However -- when intense enough -- they can disturb the atmosphere in the layer where GPS and communications signals travel. This flare is classified as an X.1-class flare. X-class denotes the most intense flares, while the number provides more information about its strength. An X2 is twice as intense as an X1, an X3 is three times as intense. Plasma from the solar flare will graze Earth tomorrow causing a possible geomagnetic storm that will create auroras for high-latitude sky watchers . A solar flare occurs when magnetic energy that has built up in the solar atmosphere is suddenly released. Radiation . is emitted across virtually the entire electromagnetic spectrum, from . radio waves at the long wavelength end, through optical emission to . x-rays and gamma rays at the short wavelength end. The amount of energy released is the equivalent of millions of 100-megaton hydrogen bombs exploding at the same time . A . flare occurs when magnetic energy that has built up in the solar . atmosphere is suddenly released - mostly in the active regions around . sunspots. Their frequency varies from several a day, when the sun is particularly active, to less than one a week during quiet periods. Earlier this week scientists came a step closer to . understanding this powerful phenomenon behind solar flares  by witnessing, for the first . time, the mechanism behind it. Footage . put together by an international team led by University of Cambridge . researchers showed entangled magnetic field lines looping from the sun’s . surface. These magnetic lines slip around each other and lead to an eruption 35 times the size of the Earth and an explosive release of magnetic energy into space. The discoveries of a gigantic energy build-up bring scientists a step closer to predicting when and where large flares will occur. ‘We care about this as during flares . we can have CMEs and sometimes they are sent in our direction,’ said . lead author, Dr Jaroslav Dudik from Cambridge University. ‘Human civilisation is nowadays maintained by technology and that technology is vulnerable to space weather.' ‘Indeed, coronal mass ejections can damage satellites and therefore have an enormous financial cost.’ ‘They . can also threaten airlines by disturbing the Earth’s magnetic field.

"By . Louise Boyle . College students who interned at Taco Bell in the mid-Nineties are the latest contenders to come forward as the 'true' inventors of Doritos taco. Andrea Watt, Mark Rader and Roy Brown were part of a summer internship at Taco Bell in 1995 when they struck on the genius move of making a taco shell from Doritos' chips. The group pitched the idea to Taco Bell executives as part of a competition for a line of Taco Bell-themed appetizers - and lost. Scroll down for video . From left to right, Andrea Watt, Mark Rader, Roy Brown and a fourth student were part of a group of summer interns who claim that they invented the Taco Bell snack using a Doritos shell back in 1995 . The Taco Bell college interns revealed promotional materials which they claim proves they are the original inventors of the Doritos-wrapped taco . Tasty profits: Since Taco Bell launched the Doritos Locos Tacos in 2012, it has made more than a $1billion in sales . Mr Brown told ABC that he didn't remember a 'very dramatic, positive reaction' to their idea. Fast forward 15 years and the interns 'idea' has become Taco Bell's golden ticket. The Doritos Locos taco - which has a spicy, cool ranch or nacho cheese shell - has made $1billion for parent company of the two products, PepsiCo, since the snack launched in 2012. The former interns are not looking for any money for the idea - just some recognition that they were behind the wildly popular snack. Mrs Watt, a former Vanderbilt student in Nashville, still has the interns' marketing materials for the Doritos tacos as proof. She told the Huffington Post: 'I’m sure I signed away that anything I . pitched to them was their property anyway. I would just . like someone to recognize that it was a good idea.' None of the former interns went on to work in the food industry. Mr Brown works as a TV writer in California, Mr Rader is an advertising copywriter and Mrs Watts is in corporate sales training. In a statement today, Taco Bell told MailOnline: 'From interns to inmates, we’ve had . no shortage of people claiming to have thought of the ''idea'' of a Doritos . flavored taco... The . reality is far more boring - the Doritos Locos Tacos that our fans love were . conceived, developed, and successfully brought to market by a hard-working, . collaborative team at Frito-Lay and Taco Bell.' Mark Rader (pictured left) and Roy Brown, the former Taco Bell interns, told ABC this week that their 1995 idea of a cross-promotion with Doritos didn't win over executives . The former interns are not the first to claim they came up with the Doritos taco. Last year, friends of Todd Mills, who passed away from cancer at Thanksgiving, petitioned Taco Bell  after they claimed he came up with the idea but never made a cent. Mr Mills reportedly had the brainwave for the Doritos Tacos Locos while watching TV in 2009 and lobbied the company and Taco Bell for two years with a Facebook campaign until it became a reality. Taco Bell told MailOnline last year that their 'hearts are with his family' but added that Mr Mills 'did not invent' the snack. Last May, an inmate at a maximum-security prison sued Taco Bell claiming the company stole his idea for the Doritos Loco Tacos. Colorado prisoner Gary Cole, who is serving 25-year sentence for a number of charges, says the restaurant chain obtained the plans from him and stole his ideas. The lawsuit was later dismissed.","Andrea Watt, Mark Rader and Roy Brown were part of a group who did a summer internship at Taco Bell in 1995 .

"By . Deborah Arthurs . Jean Paul Gaultier is no stranger to pushing the boundaries. He sparked controversy with his last couture show after he sent out Amy Winehouse lookalikes in clothing similar to those the late singer used to wear just months after her death. And with today's show, the French couturier proved that aged 60, he still knows how to push buttons. Gaultier chose as his muse the former drug addicted musician, Pete Doherty. The fashion designer encountered Doherty during his stint as a Cannes Film Festival jury member this year. Doherty made his acting debut as a 19th-century figure in a film that was screened at the Riviera event. The movie, 'Confession of a Child of the . Century,' bowled Gaultier over. 'I said my god he is so seductive, a . decadent dandy,' said the designer backstage. 'And that's my . collection.' So it was that this show, with its unlikely matinee idol as a muse, became a dandyesque tribute to the silver screen. Androgynous 'femi-man' model Andrej Pejic was the star turn of Jean Paul Gaultier's androgynous couture show this afternoon . The result was a theatrical delight. Androgynous by design and by the virtue of the show's star turn, the so-called 'femi-man' model Andrej Pejic, who strode onto the catwalk wearing a . gauzy black top that revealed his chest, it was pure Gaultier. Nineteenth . century top hats accompanied high taffeta collars, deconstructed . texture-rich satin crepe waistcoats and a sea of black. The black was broken up with explosions colour and bright fox fur, which provoked whoops of delight from the crowd. Gaultier threw in other cinema references for good measure. 'The . original idea I thought of doing Fritz Lang's Metropolis,' he said, and . indeed, as if straight out of that 1927 science-fiction film, there was . a grey metallic looking cape with golden lining. He had clearly done . his cinema homework. The . shoulderless jumpsuit which completed the ensemble had the broken sheen . of scrubbed metal, like the film's robot Mechanical Maria. Art deco prints and the odd robotic conical bra only added to the graphic feel. The . piece de resistance came in the form of a science-fiction corset cage, . that stood out from the model's body like a mechanised hourglass. 'I'm here because it's lively and provocative,' said movie star Bette Midler from the front row. And indeed it was. Theatrical: The opulent fabrics and striking shapes evoked scenes from the silver screen . Flamboyant: Androgynous suits, top hats and metallic tones were a running theme in the collection .

"By . Anna Edwards . Lee Broadbent fled to Spain's Costa del Sol and continued to operate a major cocaine supply ring is behind bars . A drugs baron who fled to the Costa del Sol and headed up a major cocaine supply ring is behind bars after he was finally arrested at a water park. Lee Broadbent, 33, led a lavish lifestyle in Malaga as a result of his drug dealing business, selling class A substances in huge quantities. Police observed one of his associates completing a deal to sell two kilos of cocaine with at least £259,000, and found the packages stuffed under the seat of a car. He was eventually caught by the Spanish national police at a water park in Torremolinos after English police obtained an international arrest warrant. He was then formally charged and brought back to the UK. The gang were today jailed for over 80 years for their part in supplying drugs in the north west of England. Lancashire policed launched Operation Oriole in September 2011 to dismantle the gang, their supply chain and to remove potentially harmful substances from the county’s streets. Preston Crown Court heard that as head of the crime group, Broadbent’s role was to organise the supply and distribution of cocaine in Lancashire and Greater Manchester. In October 2011, Broadbent and one of his associates David Wignall, were seen supplying cocaine to another criminal, Gary Gairns, on a car park at Tesco in Blackpool. A search of Gairns’ vehicle revealed a package hidden under the front passenger seat containing 1,003 grams of cocaine of 87 per cent purity, with a street value of £130,000. Cuaghtout: Broadbent and one of his associates David Wignall (right), were seen supplying cocaine to another criminal, Gary Gairns (left). After Gairns was arrested, Broadbent fled to Spain . Gary Gairns was subsequently arrested and charged with possession with intent to supply cocaine. That evening, Broadbent fled the country to Malaga, Spain via Glasgow and then Belfast. Despite being abroad, he still continued to distribute cocaine around the North West, giving orders to other drugs suppliers via pay-as-you-go mobile telephones which he believed were unlikely to be traced. The police operation continued and one occasion Wignall was seen walking with a concealed package under his jacket after visiting an address in Blackpool. He then got into a vehicle and after a short drive, Wignall exited the car without the item. A cocaine package which was seized. Lancashire policed launched Operation Oriole in September 2011 to dismantle the gang and their supply chain .

"By . SIMON JONES . Manchester City have held talks with Sergio Aguero to underline their desire to keep him well beyond this summer. The brilliant Argentina striker is understood to have met City owner Sheik Mansour in London last week. Despite being hindered by niggling injuries, Aguero has still scored 26 goals in 28 games this season to cement his reputation as one of the best forwards in the world. Super striker: Manchester City are keen to keep Sergio Aguero beyond this summer . Goal king: Aguero celebrates one of his 26 goals for City this season, despite being hampered by injuries (right) That standing means he is continuing to attract interest from the likes of Real Madrid who have wanted him at the Bernabeu since he emerged on the Spanish scene at neighbours Atletico. City realise a move back to sunnier climes and a Spanish-speaking community is a potentially attractive proposition but they are determined to show he is valued as a pivotal part of their plans. He is expected to be fit to face Liverpool in the crucial Premier League clash this weekend and the ultimate goal is for him to spearhead City's Champions League challenge next season. Hot shot: Aguero scores against Blackburn in an FA Cup replay earlier this year . Losing a talent such as Aguero would be extremely difficult to replace with only Liverpool's Luis Suarez considered in the same bracket at this stage. Although chief executive Ferran Soriano has already underlined to Florentino Perez at Real Madrid that Aguero is not for sale at any price, Sheik Mansour wanted to ensure Aguero understands just how much he is appreciated. City will continue to look at strengthening their support for him with Monaco's Radamel Falcao an option they are considering and talks ongoing for the likes of Eliaquim Mangala and Fernando at Porto. Meanwhile, the latest City player to interest the ever-busy Inter Milan is midfielder Javi Garcia. The Italians would like to arrange a loan deal but City would prefer a permanent deal. Atletico Madrid will consider asking for Petr Cech should Chelsea make Thibaut Courtois their No 1 goalkeeper next season. Atletico . want Courtois to accept a new deal at Chelsea as they believe it . represents the best chance of him being loaned out to them again next . season. However, Jose . Mourinho is understood to be seriously considering promoting the . excellent Belgian to his first team next season leaving Atletico with . the prospect of looking at alternatives. Cech will be one of them but . they will also evaluate other keepers in Spain and Pepe Reina at . Liverpool. Moving to Madrid? Atletico are considering a move for Petr Cech should Thibaut Courtois become Chelsea's No 1 . Tottenham . are favourites to sign Adam Lallana in the summer despite interest from . other clubs. There is an expectation at St Mary's that the talented . crop of Southampton players could break up this summer as England's and . Europe's elite circle their young stars. Striker . Jay Rodriguez, who is to undergo a scan on his injured knee on Monday, may . yet end up staying for another season but Lallana is widely tipped to . leave once the right bid is made. Manchester . United and City have watched Lallana but Tottenham have made it clear . they are keen on taking him to White Hart Lane as part of their summer . rejig. Spurs have already confirmed an interest in Romelu Lukaku but they would have to outbid all rivals for Chelsea to . consider selling to them. Real . Madrid have joined the . likes of Manchester United, Chelsea, City and Liverpool in admiring Southampton's teenage left back Luke Shaw but they still seem more intent on signing Alberto . Moreno from Sevilla, who again remains on United's list. Spur of the moment: Tottenham are favourites to sign Southampton star Adam Lallana (centre) Seydou Doumbia is expected to secure a move to the Premier League this summer. The Ivory Coast striker has scored 16 goals in 18 games for CSKA Moscow this season and is once again attracting keen interest across Europe with his agent Jean Bernard Beytrison sounding out potential clubs. The 26-year-old was the Golden Boot winner in Russia in 2012 and, although injury curtailed his following season, he has returned to form this year. However, Doumbia will be hoping most of the big Premier League sides don't get their main target this summer, that's because he is emerging as a popular back-up. Prolific: Seydou Doumbia (right) has scored 16 goals in 18 games for CSKA Moscow this season . Chelsea and Arsenal are among his admirers. They have monitored his scoring exploits over recent seasons but CSKA's variable valuations ranging from £15m to £30m have put them off negotiations. This time round, Chelsea want two strikers and Doumbia is coming in at around No 5 on their list of preferences which is topped by Atletico Madrid's Diego Costa. Arsenal consider him to be around fourth on their list while he is also being discussed at Everton and Newcastle but may prove too expensive for their budget. QPR have agreed a new three year deal . with 18-year-old winger Michael Petrasso. The Canada Under-20 . international, has been linked with former manager Mark Hughes at Stoke, . and would have been out of contract in the summer. Petrasso has had two . loan spells in League One this season, with Oldham and Coventry. Wolves are continuing to show interest in Portsmouth midfielder Jed Wallace. The 20-year-old England U19 man has rediscovered his form under the tutelage of caretaker manager Andy Awford and has turned in some dependable performances despite the club's slide towards the foot of League Two. Middlesbrough, Derby County and Millwall have also been watching Wallace this season but Wolves will prove an exciting project as they seek to follow up promotion from League One with an concerted attempt on replicating that in the Championship next season. Newly-promoted Leicester City are ready to contest with the big boys for Argentinian prospect Luciano Vietto. The 20-year-old, tipped to follow compatriots Sergio Aguero and Carlos Tevez to Europe, has a £7.5million buy-out clause but cash-strapped Racing Club are willing to accept around £6m with add-ons to ensure a sale this summer. Everton, Liverpool and Arsenal have all been made aware of the 5ft 8in forward, who has scored two in his last three games and has a dual Italian passport. However, Leicester are also keen to speak to his representatives as they look to strengthen their squad in key areas early in the summer to prepare for their Premier League return.

"By . Richard Shears In Sydney . A British man was due to appear in court in Melbourne today after what police said was the world’s first arrest for illegal courtside gambling  during a tennis tournament. The 22-year-old, who has not been named, is alleged to have been acting for a gambling syndicate in Eastern Europe or Central Asia. He is said to have used a hidden device at the Australian Open in Melbourne to take advantage of the few seconds’ delay between the live action and what is seen on TV. Scam: The 22-year-old Briton is alleged to have used a hidden device at the Australian Open in Melbourne . He faces up to ten years in jail if convicted of behaving in a way that would corrupt a betting outcome. According . to police, the man sat at matches in the opening days of the tournament . and used an electronic device to send messages to an associate. That . second person allegedly then placed bets before a TV delay – of between . seven and ten seconds – caught up and bookmakers changed the odds. It . is not known what matches the Briton watched, but the tournament has . attracted the big names of the sport, including Britain’s Andy Murray, . Rafael Nadal, Novak Djokovic, Serena Williams and Maria Sharapova. Delay: The TV delay from matches at the Australian Open is between seven and 10 seconds (file picture) Australian . police said the man flew into Melbourne specifically for the Grand Slam . event, but was caught and charged after a sharp-eyed official became . suspicious. Deputy Commissioner of Police in Melbourne,  Graham Ashton, said the device was concealed in the man’s clothing. At . various stages, he allegedly pressed buttons on it to indicate, for . example, whether a point had been won or lost or a double fault served . This allowed his associate to place bets on certain outcomes before they ‘happened’ on bookmakers’ television screens. Mr . Ashton added: ‘We believe he is part of a syndicate, but we don’t yet . have the details. I don’t think it’s an isolated incident. Popular: The tournament has attracted tennis's big names, including Rafael Nadal (left) and Andy Murray (right) ‘Overseas, . certainly, there are examples in relation to football, in relation to . cricket. It’s been around for several years. It’s becoming more . difficult to do because of the speed of communications and technology, . but it is still very active.’ Police said they received information about the man’s alleged activities and arrested him after checking CCTV evidence. Detectives . said investigations were continuing to find the person he was sending . messages to – believed to be in Melbourne – although it is thought the . syndicate leaders are in Europe or Asia. Tennis Australia said last night it would ‘continue to do whatever is necessary’ to rid illegal activity from the sport.

"By . Daniel Miller . China's richest man Wang Jianlin says it is easier to do business in Britain than America or the EU . China's richest man has announced he will be increasing his investments in the UK, claiming he finds it easier to do business in Britian than America or the EU. Wang Jianlin, who is said to be worth around £13billion ($22billion), was speaking to reporters at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. His conglomerate, the Dalian Wanda Group, last year bought British boat maker Sunseeker in a £320million deal and has announced plans for a five-star hotel and apartment complex on London's south bank. In 2012, the firm snapped up the U.S. cinema chain AMC Entertainment Holdings (AMC) for $2.6 billion deal. And today they announced they are talks with the French Aviation firm Dassault. Wang told CNN: 'If we compare [the United States and the European Union], the U.S. is more open than the EU. But the U.K. is the most open.' The announcement will come as welcome news to British Prime Minister David Cameron who last year took some 131 representatives of businesses ranging from financial services to healthcare on a trade mission to China. The trip reportedly resulted in over £5.6 billion ($9.3 billion) worth of trade deals between the two countries. In September last year Dalian Wanda announced it was spending $8.2 billion to develop 'motion-picture city,' which Wang described as the biggest-ever single investment in the movie and television industry. Last year Wang's conglomerate, the Dalian Wanda Group, bought Dorset-based boat builder Sunseeker in a £320million deal . When completed in 2017, the Oriental . Movie Metropolis will boast of 20 sound stages, including the world's . first underwater studio, a massive convention and exhibition complex, a . sprawling shopping mall with an indoor amusement park and seven resort . hotels.

The company also owns 6,000 movie screens, 62 department stores and 68 karaoke centres. More recently, the company has turned to offshore markets to expand its real estate and leisure investment.

"By . Jason Groves . Demotion: Nicky Morgan, 42, the new Women's Minister, will attend Cabinet but won't have full voting rights . New Women’s Minister Nicky Morgan was immediately plunged into a row yesterday after it emerged that she will not hold the full Cabinet rank of her predecessor. Labour seized on the ‘demotion’ of the role as further evidence that David Cameron has a ‘women problem’. Mrs Morgan, 42, will attend Cabinet but will not have full voting rights, taking the number of female full Cabinet ministers from four to three. She also takes over the powerful role of Financial Secretary, making her effectively number three at the Treasury. Downing Street raised eyebrows by initially suggesting the new Culture Secretary, Sajid Javid, would retain overall responsibility for women’s issues in his new role as equalities minister. But Number 10 later said this was a ‘mistake’. Mrs Morgan will now report directly to Mr Cameron like other Cabinet ministers. Labour said the confusion was further evidence of Mr Cameron’s ‘blind spot’ about women. Gloria De Piero, shadow minister for women and equalities, said: ‘There are now just three women running Government departments out of a possible 22, demonstrating that when it comes to women, it’s out of sight, out of mind.’ But Planning Minister Nick Boles, a key ally of the Prime Minister, said the criticism was ridiculous. Mr Boles, who is openly gay, wrote on Twitter: ‘Nothing irritates me more about the Left than the tedious suggestion that the rights  and interests of women can only be promoted by a woman. ‘Does that mean that my rights and interests as a gay man can only be promoted by another gay man?’ Mrs Morgan has faced criticism from some activists over her opposition to gay marriage. The former corporate lawyer was one of 128 Tory MPs who voted against it last year. Criticism: Labour seized the demotion as evidence that David Cameron has a 'women problem'. Gloria De Piero, shadow minister for women and equalities, said the number of females running governments was 'out of mind' She said at the time it was a ‘fact that marriage is between a man and a woman’. Veteran activist Peter Tatchell said her appointment would undermine efforts to promote equality. ‘How can Nicky be an effective and fully inclusive Minister for Women if she doesn’t support the right of lesbian women to marry their partners?’ he added. No 10 stressed that the mini-reshuffle meant there were now four ministers rather than three with responsibility for women’s issues: Mr Javid, Mrs Morgan, Helen Grant and Lib Dem Jenny Willott. Mr Javid was the big winner from Maria Miller’s departure yesterday, moving from number three at the Treasury to take charge of his own department. Chancellor George Osborne also ended a rumoured block on promotion for  Tory MP Andrea Leadsom. She blotted her copybook in 2012 when she suggested he should apologise to Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls over the Libor rate-fixing scandal. But yesterday she was appointed to replace Mrs Morgan as Economic Secretary to the Treasury.","Nicky Morgan, 42, will attend Cabinet but not have full voting rights .

"By . Richard Shears . Human remains have been found near the Australian waterway where a 12-year-old boy was grabbed by a crocodile on the weekend, it was revealed today. Police would not provide any more immediate details but Sergeant Steve Constable said the previous search for the youngster has now become a recovery operation. The body parts, which have yet to be formally identified, were found near the scene of the attack, in the world-famous Kakadu National Park. The child's parents, who live on a nearby Aboriginal settlement, have been informed of the discovery. Scroll down for video . A saltwater crocodile lurks in the water at Kakadu National Park: Human remains - believed to be those of a 12-year-old boy snatched by a saltie - have been found by police . The remains were found after police shot a third crocodile and examined its stomach contents for evidence of the boy, but nothing was found. They said that two more crocodiles were seen in the area where the body parts were found, but they sank back beneath the water before they could be shot and examined. In a statement, police said that officers and rangers from Parks Australia had recommenced the search for the missing boy, 'believed to have been taken by a crocodile whilst swimming in a billabong west of Jabiru.' Acting Commander Michael White of the Northern Command said teams have been conducting ground, boat and air searches since the boy's disappearance at Mudginberri Billabong on Sunday afternoon.' He said that this morning, 'search teams have now located evidence within the search area which strongly indicates the boy has died from the crocodile attack.' Commander White said further DNA testing would be carried out to confirm identification. Remote: The park boasts stunning, unspoiled landscapes and sits in the northern part of Australia . But he said that no specifics would be given in relation to the trauma or type of evidence located out of respect for the family. A report will now be prepared for the coroner. Meanwhile a mother of one of the victim's friends told the Northern Territory News of her son's terror as he witnessed the crocodile attack. Sandra Djandjul, 38, who lives near the billabong, said her son was still frightened by the horrific attack. 'He keeps thinking too much about his cousin-brother,' she said. It was her son, Jayden, who was initially attacked by the crocodile, resulting in his right arm being bruised all the way to the shoulder. He also had to have three stitches, but he was able to escape with his life. The small community of about 50 people, who live some 14 miles from the mining town of Jabiru, have been shaken by the attack, aware that many children have been swimming in the billabong in recent times. Residents said the killer crocodile, which is believed to have been fairly small at around 2.5metres long, could be anywhere - and there were fears that it could strike again. 'Even small crocs can be dangerous,' said a local business owner, who pointed out that all they had to do was drag a human under water and hold the victim until they drowned. The child was taken while swimming in Mudginberri billabong just north of Jabiru in Kakadu National Park . Since the boy's disappearance on Sunday, a grim search has been conducted which has involved several crocodiles being shot and their stomachs cut open. Two large crocodiles were shot on Sunday night as police and park rangers patrolled the stretch of water where the boy and a group of friends were swimming. A crocodile expert examined the bite marks on the arm of Jayden, the boy who survived the attack, to establish the size of the reptile to prevent numerous 'innocent' creatures being shot. He estimated the attacking crocodile to be between 2.5 and 3metres. Police sergeant Stephen Constable said other officers and park rangers had located two large crocodiles in the Mudginberri billabong in the early hours of the morning in the area where the boy was taken. 'One was 4.3 metres and one was 4.7 metres,'  Sergeant Constable told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. 'Both of those were shot and removed from the area. 'We've since had a look at both crocodiles and neither of them had anything in their stomachs and we're now going to continue the search.' More... Spearfishing doctor fights off shark with a knife... then calmly stitches up the bites before going to the pub . Officials had been searching the area, around 140 miles east of Darwin, since early Sunday afternoon after the alarm was raised. Police also spoke to four of the boys from a nearby Aboriginal settlement who witnessed the terrifying attack. Kakadu is where the original Crocodile Dundee movie was made. Twelve months ago another teenager fought off a five metre saltwater crocodile in the same area, resulting in warnings being stepped up about the dangers of crocs in Northern Territory rivers and waterways. Because there have been no attacks in the Mudginberri billabong area in recent times, police believe the boys entered the water without looking around for crocodiles that might be lurking there. The current wet season is the most dangerous time of year to be swimming in the Territory's waters. From the beginning of the search, it was understood that privately police and rangers feared there would be little chance of the missing boy still being alive - crocodiles usually swim with their prey to the bottom of rivers and perform a 'death roll' until the victim drowns, if death has not already occurred in the reptile's jaws. Saltwater crocodiles - known as salties -  can grow up to seven metres long, weigh more than a tonne, and are a common feature of Australia's tropical north. Their numbers have increased steadily since the introduction of protection laws in 1971, with government estimates putting the population at 75,000-100,000. The most recent fatality was in August last year, when a man was taken by a 4.7-metre croc as he swam across the Mary River. Parks officials said the Magela Creek area was well signposted as a crocodile danger zone. 'We have big croc warning signs with croc jaws and a big thing saying ""croc risk; do not swim here, do not enter"",' a spokeswoman said. Australian researchers launched the world's first crocodile attack database, CrocBITE, last month, hoping to firm up anecdotal reports that harmful or fatal incidents are increasing. Sunday's attack in Kakadu is the 11th fatality recorded so far this year by the CrocBITE team, which is based at Australia's Charles Darwin University. The other crocodile-related deaths in 2014 have been in Angola, East Timor, India, Indonesia, Namibia, Papua New Guinea, South Africa, Zambia and Zimbabwe. Five have involved saltwater crocs. Thirteen people, including six children, have been killed by crocodiles in Australia in the past 12 years.","Remains found this morning near where boy was taken by crocodile .

"By . Richard Shears . Police and park rangers are looking for a 12-year-old boy taken by a crocodile while he was swimming with his friends in northern Australia. Officers said the boy was swimming with other youngsters in the Mudginberri billabong in Kakadu National Park when the crocodile moved in on them. Another boy, also aged 12, was bitten on the arm and had to receive treatment at a medical centre in his remote community, but the second boy disappeared. Taken: Police privately believe there is little chance that the boy will be found alive after he was dragged away by a crocodile . His friends said they believed the . crocodile had grabbed him. Police and park rangers later put out in boats . for look for the missing boy. Saltwater . crocodiles - referred to locally as 'salties' - are in abundance in the . national park, where filming for the original Crocodile Dundee movie . was made. Early today Deputy Police Superintendent Sachin Sharma told the Northern Territory News that police and park rangers were on their way to the location, some 140 miles east of Darwin. A billabong - an Aboriginal word - describes a calm, isolated stretch of water left behind when a river changes its course. 'I can confirm there has been a report (of a young boy being taken by a crocodile),' he said. 'Police have just arrived, but it's outside the communication zone.' The unnamed boy is believed to have been taken while swimming in Mudginberri billabong just north of Jabiru in Kakadu National Park . Miss Margot Marshall, a spokeswoman for . Parks Australia, confirmed that rangers had joined police in the search . for the missing boy. The feared tragedy has occurred when the rest of the country was celebrating Australia Day, commemorating the time when the First Fleet, bringing pioneers - and prisoners - arrived on the continent on January 26, 1788. Signs have been erected near many rivers and pools in the Northern Territory warning people not to enter the water because of the large numbers of crocodiles. Thirteen people, including six children, have been killed by crocodiles in Australia in the past 12 years.","The unnamed boy was at Mudginberri billabong in Kakadu National Park .

"By . Harry Mount . British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher still has no monument in her home town . Tomorrow is the first anniversary of the death of the most influential peacetime Prime Minister in British history. Take a walk through Margaret Thatcher’s hometown, though, and you could be forgiven for thinking she hadn’t spent her formative years here. Yes, there’s a plaque on her childhood home, the greengrocer’s owned by her father, Alfred Roberts, Grantham’s mayor in 1946. But it could hardly be smaller — high up on the first floor, barely legible from the pavement. And it isn’t even one of the official blue plaques normally granted to the great and the good. Today, her childhood home is a health clinic, Living Health, specialising in ‘chiropractic, natural therapies and beauty’. In the shop window, a large poster offers a treatment to ‘tone, slim and detox’ you with a marine algae bodywrap. One wall of Alfred Roberts’s old shop is given over to an advert that reads: ‘Gift Vouchers Available Here — Give the Gift of Relaxation.’ Lady Thatcher had many gifts — the art of relaxation wasn’t one of them. In Grantham’s pretty town centre, there is nothing to remind you of the person who changed the face of Britain. On the green, there’s a statue to Grantham’s most famous son — Sir Isaac Newton. Opposite is the Isaac Newton Shopping Centre. There’s another plaque marking the spot where Newton lodged as a schoolboy. And there are two more Newton plaques outside King’s Grammar School, where he was head boy. A few yards away, there is a bronze statue to the Honourable Frederick Tollemache, Grantham’s Liberal MP, on and off, from 1826 until 1874. The inscription reads: ‘Erected in 1891 by the friends who revered his memory, irrespective of political opinions.’ I mean no disrespect to Mr Tollemache but, even in the 19th century, he wasn’t much of a name to conjure with in British politics. Certainly nothing compared with the town’s colossally famous, most distinguished daughter. Even her most fervent supporters might not rank Margaret Thatcher alongside the man who discovered gravity. But surely she deserves a statue at least as much as Frederick Tollemache. If this were America — where Thatcher is revered more than she is in Britain — Grantham would be the equivalent of a presidential birthplace. Every hotel, tea shop and pub would be plastered with Thatcher references. The town signs would be emblazoned with her name; her childhood home would be bought up by admirers, and thronged with pilgrims. But not in modern Britain. On two recent visits to Grantham, I had the pavement outside her childhood home to myself, for half an hour each time, as I took photographs. Baroness Margaret Thatcher's birthplace in Grantham. The site was a greengrocer, then a restaurant and is now a health clinic . So thank God, then, for two women who, off their own bat, have determined to leave a Thatcherite stamp on the town that made her. The first is Helen Goral, chairman of Grantham Museum. Three years ago, the museum was in a terrible way, with Lincolnshire County Council unable to afford its upkeep. It had a Thatcher display, but it was woeful — not much more than one of her handbags and  a pair of her shoes. Enter Helen and a team of volunteers, who took over the running of the museum as a community heritage association in 2011, and reinvigorated the Thatcher display. The museum remains small but now has some real gems: including the dinner jacket worn by Alfred Roberts in his mayoral year, and an utterly characteristic royal blue dress and handbag, donated from Lady Thatcher’s personal wardrobe. There’s a copy of Handel’s Messiah, owned by a 15-year-old Margaret Roberts in 1940, and the programme for the 1937 Grantham and District Eisteddfod, in which she performed. Most intriguing is the hockey stick Margaret used to wield at Kesteven and Grantham Girls’ School, where she was head girl. When she left, her hockey stick, and her school uniform, were passed on to Ann Nidd, a young neighbour, just starting at the school. Scratched into the head of the hockey stick are two names, ‘M. Roberts’ and ‘A. Nidd’. The museum also has a copy of Thatcher’s memoirs, inscribed by her with the words: ‘From this town I learnt so much and am proud to be one of its citizens.’ But still, the streets of Grantham are empty of any tribute to its proud daughter. But, with luck and a little money, not for long. A bust of Margaret Thatcher resided in her birthplace, but an official monument is still in the pipeline . On March 8, 2013 — coincidentally, exactly a month before Lady Thatcher’s death — Helen Goral started an appeal to raise £100,000 for a Lady Thatcher statue, and another £100,000 for further improvements to the Thatcher display at the museum. Much of the money collected has come from Grantham locals. Helen says they are still ‘two big donations’ away from achieving their goal. ‘We didn’t consider applying for government funds,’ she says. ‘Private donations are much more in line with Lady Thatcher’s beliefs. ‘This is a project for the community, but it shouldn’t be taxpayer-funded. Lady Thatcher wouldn’t have wanted council tax to be spent on a statue. She’d have said that the money could be better spent elsewhere.’ Helen is chair of the advisory panel that will determine what the statue looks like. Three prospective poses have been considered — two standing, one sitting — but no final decision has been made. The plan is for the statue to go inside the museum or stand on the green. Between Isaac Newton and Frederick Tollemache is a perfect stretch of grass just waiting for her. ‘People are concerned about the potential of vandalism,’ says Helen, ‘It depends on planning, too, but I’d prefer it to be outside.’ Of course it must go outside, even at the considerable risk of vandalism — another statue of Margaret Thatcher was decapitated by a thug at the Guildhall Art Gallery in 2002. But even that attack was a kind of tribute, I thought at the time — who’d bother to decapitate a statue of John Major or Gordon Brown? The second woman to strike a blow for Margaret Thatcher’s memory in Grantham is sculptor Lisa Hawker. As of last Friday, her charming bronze bust of Lady Thatcher has taken pride of place in Grantham Museum’s main hall. It shows Margaret Thatcher, with a slight smile, in the early Eighties, when she was in her 50s and her prime. Lisa based the work on video footage and old photographs to ‘absorb her personality’. Then she spent several months moulding Lady T in clay before casting her in bronze. The bust — which is at the museum on a free loan — will be on show until the end of the month. Lisa says she was inspired to do the bust because of negative reaction to Thatcher after her death. ‘She deserved respect after she died — I thought it was absolutely shocking how she was treated. ‘People weren’t getting the person behind the politician. And most of the art showed her as a politician, not as a woman, which is what I wanted to do. You had to respect her drive and determination. ‘I was a young adult when she came to power, so I remember what the country was like before,’ she says. ‘She was a force for good at the time. Opinion is always going to be divided. But her legacy was so great and she achieved so much from humble origins.’ As for the statue, the sculptor has yet to be decided. Helen Goral jokes that although the material is most likely to be bronze, ‘iron has been suggested!’ In the meantime, Margaret Thatcher will be remembered in the condolence book, signed in the Grantham Museum after her death. One entry pays tribute from someone who says they are for ever in her debt, having benefited from Thatcher’s flagship policy of selling people their council house. It adds: ‘People must not forget the three-day week and sitting at home in candlelight because the coal miners were on strike. RIP.’ Another simply says: ‘You will always be remembered in Grantham for all you did for the country — and you were a Grantham girl.’","HARRY MOUNT on the fight for a monument to the Iron Lady in Grantham .

"By . Sam Webb . Four people have been arrested after three wealthy tourists were bludgeoned by a hammer-wielding attacker who sneaked into their hotel room in the middle of the night. One woman is in a critical condition and the other two remain in hospital although their injuries are not believed to be life-threatening. Khuloud Al Muhairi, 36, is still fighting for her life more than 48 hours after being attacked at the hotel, which is off Oxford Street in central London. She is reported to have been placed in an induced coma. A police car parked outside the entrance of The Cumberland Hotel in central London, where three women were attacked with a hammer by an intruder in one of the rooms inside. Their father said: 'My heart is broken to a million pieces' Four stars: The Cumberland Hotel in London, where the hammer attack on three women in their thirties took place . Botched burglary: Police believe the suspect entered a room on the seventh floor where the three women were staying with three children in adjoining rooms (stock image of a Cumberland Hotel room) The 70-year-old father of the three Emirati women was able to speak to his eldest daughter for the first time on Monday evening. He told The National: 'Khuloud, they told me, had an operation on her nose and jaw,' said Jaffar Nasser Al Najjar. “I could barely hear her. She kept saying, ‘I’m OK, Dad. Don’t worry’. 'My heart is broken to a million pieces and I can’t do anything except to pray that they return safely.'It is understood two other women injured in the same incident in the early hours of Sunday and now recovering at a London hospital are her sisters Fatimah Al Muhairi, 31, and 34-year-old Ohoud Al Muhairi. All three women, from the United Arab Emirates (UAE), were enjoying a break in London with their children and other relatives. Scene: One of the women is in a critical but stable condition after the assault at the Cumberland Hotel near Oxford Street in London . Manhunt: Police are appealing for any witnesses of the incident on Sunday morning at the Cumberland Hotel, pictured, to come forward . A fourth woman, who was staying next door and ran down from the seventh floor to the first screaming for help, is believed to be 18-year-old relative Shekha Al Mauhairi. A lone man managed to get into the room on the seventh floor of the four-star Cumberland Hotel near Marble Arch in London's West End in the early hours of Sunday morning. When one of the women woke up, he attacked her with the hammer, and then turned on the two other victims, fleeing the hotel in bloodstained clothes. A Metropolitan Police spokesman said three men, aged 56, 34 and 32, were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder at addresses in Islington, north London, yesterday. A 31-year-old woman was held on suspicion of handling stolen goods. All four remain in custody at north London police stations. The women, who are in their thirties, had travelled to London for a shopping spree from their home in the United Arab Emirates . It is understood that the three women, who are all from the United Arab Emirates, had deliberately left their door unlocked because they were staying in the hotel as part of a large family group. They were sleeping with three children, who were unharmed, in two adjoining rooms. The wealthy family, who had come to London for shopping and sightseeing, arrived in the UK between April 3 and 5 and the women had visited large West End stores on Saturday. No keys were stolen from the hotel and police said there had been no breach of security at the venue. Detectives are scouring CCTV to establish the movements of both the women and their attacker earlier in the day. The Cumberland Hotel is near Europe's busiest shopping street, Oxford Street, and has 1,000 rooms including a Jimi Hendrix suite.

"By . Fiona Macrae . Yoga can re-energise women who have battled breast cancer. Just three months of practising postures, breathing and meditation cut fatigue in cancer survivors by more than half. Inflammation, which is linked to health problems from heart disease to frailty, and increases the odds of cancer coming back, was also eased. Yoga can re-energise women who have battled breast cancer and just three months of practising postures, breathing and meditation cut their fatigue by more than half, according to a new study . The large, U.S. based study suggests that something as cheap and gentle as yoga could be of huge benefit to breast cancer patients. Breast cancer is Britain’s most common cancer with almost 50,000 cases a year. Survival rates are improving but the gruelling treatments can leave women feeling worn out for months – or even years – after they have stopped. The Ohio State University researchers recruited 200 women who had survived cancer of varying degrees of severity. Half were asked to attend 90-minute yoga classes twice a week and practise at home, if they could. The research suggests that something as cheap and gentle as yoga could be of huge benefit to breast cancer patients. Breast cancer is Britain's most common cancer with almost 50,000 cases a year. Magnified human breast cancer cells dividing are pictured . The other women were told to go about life as normal but promised yoga classes after the study was finished. The women, who had undergone surgery and powerful treatments such as radiotherapy and chemotherapy, were also quizzed about their energy levels and subjected to blood tests. None had done any yoga before the start of the study. Three months after the yoga classes had ended, fatigue was an average of 57 per cent lower in attendees, the Journal of Clinical Oncology reports. This is important as persistent tiredness can make people more frail by reducing the amount of exercise they are able to do. As a result, even day-to-day activities become more challenging. The study also showed that the more yoga a woman did, the greater the boost in energy levels. Blood tests showed a reduction in levels of compounds linked to the inflammation. It is thought that better sleep, helped by the yoga, could have cut fatigue and inflammation and allowed the cancer survivors to do more and so enhanced their quality of life. Yoga sessions could give others - including older women (pictured) - an energy boost, the scientists said . The psychological benefits of yoga have been much studied but this research is some of the first to pin down some of the underlying biology. Researcher Professor Janet Kiecolt-Glaser said the women may have benefited from improvements in their breathing and the stress relief of mediation. Better sleep could have cut fatigue and inflammation and allowed the women to do more and so enhanced their quality of life. She said: ‘This showed that modest yoga practice over a period of several months could have substantial benefits for breast cancer survivors.’ The professor added that yoga sessions could give others – including the elderly – an energy boost. Eluned Hughes, of charity Breakthrough Breast Cancer, said: ‘More people are getting breast cancer than ever before which means quality of life after treatment is increasingly important. ‘These are promising results which suggest that yoga could reduce fatigue and inflammation after treatment; improving well-being for many breast cancer survivors.’","Three months of practising postures, breathing and meditation cut fatigue in cancer survivors by more than half .

"By . David Wilkes . Updated: . 03:24 EST, 23 November 2011 . After 25 years in the baking business, Rachel Brown knew her exquisitely decorated cupcakes were popular. She just didn’t realise how popular. So when she decided to drum up a little extra trade with a discount deal, she bit off more than she could chew. Swamped by orders, Mrs Brown, who normally makes 100 cupcakes a month, found herself having to bake an astonishing 102,000. Recipe for disaster: Rachel Brown had to draft in 25 staff as demand surged for her cupcakes . And disastrously, because her deal . had been so generous and the demand so huge, she made a loss on every . order – wiping out her profits for the entire year. The cupcake catastrophe started when the 50-year-old cook posted a deal on money-saving website Groupon. She offered subscribers to the site a 75 per cent discount on 12 cakes – selling them for £6.50 instead of the usual £26. Mrs Brown, from Woodley, near . Reading, said: ‘We only expected to get a few hundred orders out of it . but we had thousands and thousands pouring in. We had to cut it off at . 8,500 orders.’ Her company, called Need a Cake, . normally employs eight workers, but it had to bring in 25 agency staff. After spending an extra £12,500 on staff and distribution, she made a . loss of £2.50 per order. Sour taste: Cake maker Rachel Brown outside her company Need A Cake, in Woodley near Reading. She was besieged with more than 8,500 requests after placing a discount deal on money-saving website Groupon . Rising to the occasion: Mrs Brown's staff worked night and day to meet the extraordinary demand . ‘Without doubt, it’s the worst ever business decision I have made,’ she said. ‘It’s been an absolute nightmare.’ U.S.-based Groupon is a ‘deal-a-day’ website offering coupons to subscribers, giving discount deals on . anything from restaurant meals to spa treatments. It uses collective buying power to . achieve lower prices and the deals it offers are available only if a . minimum number of people sign up. Companies that offer deals hope to . gain new custom or sell extra goods to customers during their visit. Mrs Brown’s offer on the website . invited customers to ‘construct their ideal cupcake, choosing from . sponge flavour, icing and decoration options’. And it certainly proved tempting. Mrs . Brown said: ‘As soon as we were making, packaging and sending the cakes . out we were on to the next order. It was non-stop. We take pride in . making cakes of exceptional quality but I had to bring in agency staff . on top of my usual staff, who had nowhere near the same skills. ‘I was very worried about standards dropping and hated the thought of letting anybody down. ‘Even a much larger company would have difficulty coping, but my poor staff were having to slog away at all hours. ‘One of them even came in at 3am . because she couldn’t sleep for worry. I’ve been running this business . for 25 years and I thought I knew what I was doing.

Sinking feeling: Need A Cake, which usually employs eight people, had to take on an extra 25 agency staff to meet demand, and in the process wiped out all the profits for the year . Fallout: One of Mrs Brown's employees Jo Walsby was given the unenviable task of fielding calls from angry cupcake buyers whose orders  were taking longer than expected to be fulfilled . Boxed in: Need A Cake usually sells boxes of cupcakes for upwards of £26, meaning a £2.50 loss was made on each of the £6.50 Groupon offers . She said: ‘We approach each business with a tailored, individual approach based on the prior history of similar deals.’ She added there had been ‘constant . contact’ with Need a Cake and this was the first time she had heard the . company had experienced difficulties. But Mrs Brown has refuted this claim, saying she has written records of correspondence highlighting the problem. Meanwhile, a message on her website informs customers the deal is no longer available.

"A man who blew himself up at Beijing Airport claims he was left paralysed by local law enforcement officers and heavily in debt following a horrific and unprovoked attack. Miraculously no-one was killed when Ji Zhongxing detonated a home made bomb strapped to himself at Terminal 3 on Saturday, including the bomber himself. It has now emerged in a blog post, the the 34-year-old from Shandong province has been fighting for justice over what he says was a terrifying attack when he was beaten unconscious with iron bars by security men in 2005. Scroll down for video . Suspect: This photograph of Ji Zhongxing has emerged since he blew himself up at Beijing Airport on Saturday. Left, Zhongxing shortly before detonating his home-made bomb . Beaten: Zhongxing claims he was horrifically beaten by security guards in 2005 and left paralysed as a result . In a blog post, Zhongxing wrote: 'We looked to the sky, and the sky looked away; we called to the earth, and the earth did not respond. 'We have been forsaken but have nobody to turn to, so all I could do was to hold back tears and go back to Shandong. 'And now I am festering away, paralysed and over 100,000 yuan in debt.' According to media website Shanhaiist, Zhongxing was originally from Shandong province, but moved to Guangdong in search of work. He bought himself a motorbike and started a taxi business. One night in June, 2005 he claims he was taking a chef home called Gong Tao when a police car sounded its' siren. Desperate? Beijing bomber Ji Zhongxing claims to have been horrifically beaten by security staff armed with iron bars . He wrote: 'At the time I didn't think I was doing anything wrong, and the road was quite narrow so I did not stop and continued driving. 'When I passed by the Xin Tang Public Security Office, I saw there were seven or eight chengguan (local law enforcement officers) blocking the road, holding steel rods and pipes. 'Just as I was about to brake, a chengguan threw one of the steel pipes across my face, throwing both myself and my passenger on the floor. 'When I came to, it was already noon the next day. I was in pain all over, and when I opened my eyes I saw that I was lying on the hospital bed, the passenger I took was also hurt and in hospital. 'When Gong Tao saw that I was conscious, he told me that policemen from Xin Tang Public Security refused to let me go and started hitting my legs, feet, waist, striking me furiously with the steel bars. Explosion: Photographs emerged online in the wake of the blast of a man in a wheelchair waving his arms in the air at Beijing Airport . 'They hit me until I was unconscious, and only took me to hospital when they'd seen the police car that was following me had also arrived onto the scene, and that I was practically dead. After that, they disappeared without a trace. 'Because we are farmers, and are poor, no matter who we turn to, nobody wants to help us. And what's more, when the chengguan found us, they turned around and called us tramps and beat us. 'If it weren't for them taking us to hospital on time, I wouldn't have survived.' Zhongxing claims to have been left heavily in debt as a result his legal battle for compensation, and is trying to claim 334,782 yuan from the Chinese authorities, about Â£36,000. The post has not been corroborated and his original blog was taken down shortly after Saturday's chilling incident. Zhongxing was originally suspected to have died in the blast at around 6.24pm local time, but Chinese state media said later he survived and was taken to hospital. Shortly before the explosion, Zhongxing was seen handing out leaflets to passengers. A photograph emerged online in the wake of the explosion showing a man in a wheelchair brandishing something in the air, along with another showing an empty wheelchair on its side in the smoke-filled arrivals hall. Panic: Clouds of smoke filled the arrivals hall today after the man set off a home-made bomb in the busy airport . Witnesses say that Ji shouted 'I have a bomb, stay away from me' before detonating his device. Ji was rushed to a local hospital following the explosion. Reports vary as to his injuries, with some Chinese media saying his arm had to be amputated. Hospitalised: This picture released by China's Xinhua agency shows police and paramedics attending to the man at Terminal 3 .

"By . Lizzie Edmonds . Inquest: Lieutenant Edward Drummond-Baxter, 29, was shot dead by a man in Afghan Police uniform at a checkpoint in Helmand Province, an inquest heard . A British officer who had only been in Afghanistan for a month was shot by an Afghan he believed to be an ally, an inquest heard. Eton-educated Lieutenant Edward Drummond-Baxter, 29, from County Durham, had initially disarmed the man. He returned the AK-47 to him at a checkpoint but was then shot through the head at close range. The man, wearing Afghan police uniform, then turned his weapon on another soldier, 28-year-old Lance Corporal Siddhanta Kunwar, fatally shooting him twice through the chest. Another officer in a nearby watchtower tried to return fire, but the killer managed to flee to nearby cover. He has not been traced. The two men were shot just days after Taliban leader Mullah Omar had called for his followers to infiltrate 'within the ranks of the enemy'. Mr Drummond-Baxter, who left the Foreign Office to join the Army, had told his family he feared the Taliban were trying to kill him. The two soldiers were based at Checkpoint . Prrang, near Nahr-e-Saraj, in Helmand Province when the shooting took place on October 30, . 2012. They were from the 1st Battalion, Royal Gurkha Rifles, and were . part of the gradual handover by ISAF, the international military force, . to local Army and police units. The inquest heard how it is still unclear whether the gunman - aged around 19 or 20 - was a real member of the Afghan Uniformed Police. An interpreter from the base said in a statement: 'I recognised the AUP because he had been here before. 'An . interpreter who worked here, who left 10 days before, had told the . previous commander there was a member of the AUP who was suspicious. 'He looked like real AUP but was fake,' said the interpreter. 'His brother may have given him the uniform.' Others claimed they had never seen the man before. Death: The man also shot Lance Corporal Siddhanta Kunwar, 28, twice in the chest, killing him - the hearing was told . The hearing at Oxford Guildhall heard how he had turned up at the checkpoint wearing uniform before and a previous British commander at the base had raised suspicions about the man. The killer approached the checkpoint saying he wanted to speak to an interpreter. He was sent away, but returned to ask again after spending 15 minutes talking to farmers nearby. Eventually he was let in and disarmed. After being in the base for about an hour and telling Lt. Drummond-Baxter: 'You are my friend, a very good friend,' the killer then asked for some boots he claimed he had been promised. When . told there were none, he asked to leave and was escorted to the gate by . the interpreters and LCpl Kunwar, while the commander went to get his . gun. Neither of the British soldiers was wearing body armour or helmets but both had sidearms on as they approached the gate. The interpreter said: 'The AUP was stood level with the commander and close to him. 'The commander handed his his weapon. I think the magazine was already fitted. 'He (AUP) loaded it. The commander didn’t seem concerned. The mood was good, it was friendly. He had laughed. He turned his face back towards the AUP and as he did the AUP started shooting. 'It was the commander’s face he was aiming at.' Both interpreters fled, with one of them shouting repeatedly: 'Shoot the AUP, shoot the AUP.' The inquest heard how Lt Drummond-Baxter had told his family the Taliban were trying to kill him - proving he was doing a good job. The officer was just a month into his first deployment to Afghanistan when he died. There had been a grenade attack three days earlier and someone had fired a shot at his patrol base’s raised CCTV camera on the morning of the fatal attack. Operation: The two soldiers from the 1st Battalion, Royal Gurkha Rifles, were part of the ISAF military handover to local Army and police units (pictured) A lawyer for the officer’s family also said Taliban leader Mullah Omar had said six days earlier that his followers should increase their 'efforts to expand the areas of infiltration within the ranks of the enemy.' Yet the two solder's colleagues said they were not aware of any specific 'insider threat' from their Afghan counterparts. The coroner said she had broadened the scope of the hearing to include a number of matters, including the role of the so-called ‘guardian angel’ - a role allotted to a soldier to provide cover inside a checkpoint and to watch for any threat. Danger: The two men, based in Helmand Province, pictured, were shot days after Taliban leader Mullah Omar called for his followers to infiltrate 'within the ranks of the enemy' Speaking outside the hearing,  the family of Edward Drummond Baxter said: 'We know from many different accounts that in his role in Afghanistan Edward strived to serve alongside his platoon and the communities he was tasked to protect, with commitment, loyalty and friendship. 'We hope the lessons learned from Edward and Siddantha’s deaths will be heard and applied as allied forces continue to withdraw to ensure the safety of our men and women still serving in Afghanistan.' The inquest before Oxfordshire’s assistant coroner Alison Thompson continues.","Lieutenant Edward Drummond-Baxter, 29, shot in the head at close range .

"By . James Tozer . Claims: Bill Roache pictured yesterday leaving Preston Crown Court, where he was accused of twice raping a 15-year-old girl . William Roache pushed a schoolgirl on to a bed at his family home and committed a ‘cold, calculating’ rape, a court heard yesterday. The veteran Coronation Street star targeted the 15-year-old a second time during the summer of 1967, pinning her up against a wall and, in a ‘quick fumble’ that lasted a matter of minutes, raped her again, a jury heard. However, she came forward only last year after watching a television interview in which Roache spoke of how ‘there have been lots of women in my life’, which she said ‘made my skin crawl’. Roache, 81, who has appeared as Ken Barlow since the ITV1 soap’s launch in 1960, is also accused of indecently assaulting four girls more than 40 years ago, allegedly exploiting his celebrity status in the belief they wouldn’t speak out. Wearing a dark blue suit and striped tie, he sat impassively in court as the allegations were outlined on day three of his trial. Yesterday, the jury heard from a 62-year-old woman who told how as a schoolgirl she joined autograph-hunters calling at the bungalow Roache shared with his first wife, Anna Cropper, in Haslingden, Lancashire. But on one evening after school in 1967, she said, she went to the house and asked about their newborn daughter Vanya, and Roache invited her into the living room where they stood chatting. At the time, she said, she was ‘just a kid’, a 15-year-old virgin who dressed in a T-shirt, skirt and socks and enjoyed playing hide and seek and hopscotch. She said the actor led her to a darkened back bedroom where she expected to be shown the baby, but instead he pushed her onto a double bed and climbed on top of her. ‘He didn’t kiss me, nothing,’ she said in a police interview played to the jury at Preston Crown Court. ‘He was very cold and calculating.’ She added: ‘I was a bit shocked. There was nothing to suggest that anything improper was going to happen. He was a friendly person. ‘I didn’t know what to do. I was panicking. I didn’t have to fight him. He was not aggressive in any way.’ She said that Roache put on a condom before raping her. Unable to resist as ‘he was big, I was little’, she said she lay beneath him for as long as 45 minutes, with Roache ‘huffing and puffing’. ‘It just seemed to go on a long time,’ she said. ‘I was scared. I just remember trying to stare at the ceiling but it was dark. That awful feeling of him pinning me down.’ Afterwards, she said, ‘the door opened and I was allowed to go’. The woman said that later that year Roache invited her into a cottage nearby to which he had a key, which proved to be a ‘big mistake’. ‘Of course, idiot that I was, I stopped inside the doorway, and before I knew it I had been grabbed again,’ she said. Scroll down for video . 'Attack': Roache's former home and the cottage. His alleged victim went there with autograph hunters . Family: Roache, 81, leaving the court with his children James, Linus and Verity after the end of the third day of proceedings in his trial for historical sex offences . Evidence: Roache sitting in court watching the witness giving evidence by video link . Hearing: Roache watches an alleged victim recorded in an interview with a police officer . This time she said Roache pushed her against the wall of the front room and raped her, only this time the alleged attack was over in a matter of minutes. ‘There was no intimacy leading up to it,’ she said, describing it as ‘just an instant thing’. ‘I can’t explain why I was so gullible,’ she added. The woman said she had not reported the alleged attacks at the time because she feared no one would believe her. ‘I thought it had been my fault,’ she said, adding the attacks had left her feeling ‘frightened, ashamed and disgusted’. She denied she had ‘fancied’ Roache but added ‘possibly he fancied himself’, describing how she would see him ‘with a golf club teeing off on his lawn’ when female fans came hoping for autographs. Arriving: Roache, 81, pictured outside court with his son Linus and daughter Verity . Defendant: The veteran actor came to court with his family and security staff . She said she did not speak to the . actor again until a chance encounter about ten years later when he was a . judge on a baby show at a local carnival, she said. Walking past her, . she said he stopped and said: ‘Oh hello, I know you, don’t I?’ Following . the Jimmy Savile scandal and allegations against the late MP Sir Cyril . Smith in 2012, she said she was talking to her son who branded such . claims ‘lies’, and asked: ‘Why’s this come to light now?’ She . told him child victims would have been too scared to come forward in . previous decades, and when he asked how she knew, she answered ‘because . I’ve been in that position myself’, telling him she had been attacked by . ‘Ken Barlow’. Gift: The jury in the trial of Coronation Street actor Bill Roache was shown this signed photo, allegedly sent to a 14-year-old girl who has accused him of indecent assault in the 1960s . Note: The letter, which is allegedly from the star, now 81, was addressed from Granada TV and asked her to write back 'when you start school again' Witness box: Bill Roache listens as the first witness in the case against him gives evidence from behind a screen at Preston Crown Court . First witness: Roache's first alleged victim, now 63, giving evidence to the court . In the dock: Coronation Street star Bill Roache is accused of two counts of rape and five indecent assaults dating back almost 50 years . Some time . later, she said she was watching Roache interviewed on television by . Piers Morgan. Branding him ‘arrogant’, she added: ‘He was talking about . the number of women in his life. He was quite amused by it all. 'It made . my skin crawl, to be honest. It was just the way he laughed it all off.’ As . a result, she contacted police in March last year. Her complaint led to . Roache being charged with two counts of rape. Following publicity over . his arrest, four other women came forward alleging Roache had sexually . assaulted them. The woman . said she suffered two strokes in 2002 which ‘wiped out’ part of her . memory, but insisted she remembered the alleged rapes clearly. The Crown . say Roache ‘took full advantage of his stardom’ to sexually abuse the . girls, confident his celebrity status would silence his ‘star-struck’ victims. The widowed actor . again attended court with his sons Linus, 49, and James, 28, and . daughter Verity, 32. Roache, of Wilmslow, Cheshire, denies five counts . of indecent assault and two of rape involving five girls aged 16 or . under. The trial continues.

"By . Sara Malm . An Icelandic brewery is launching a beer containing dead fin whales, claiming it is a ‘healthy low-fat alternative’. Brugghús Steðja has teamed up with whaling company Hvalur to launch the 5.2% beer, produced in time for the Icelandic mid-winter festival. Environmentalist groups are outraged as they believe the beer poses a threat to the endangered fin whale. Danger beer: Environmental group Whale and Dolphin Conservation (WDC) believes that the new beer poses a risk to the endangered fin whale, traditionally hunted in Iceland . The conservation group's Icelandic . whaling campaign leader Vanessa Williams-Grey said: ‘Demand for this . meat is in decline, with fewer and fewer people eating it. ‘Even . so, reducing a beautiful, sentient whale to an ingredient on the side . of a beer bottle is about as immoral and outrageous as it is possible to . get. ‘The brewery may . claim that this is just a novelty product with a short shelf life, but . what price the life of an endangered whale which might have lived to be . 90 years?’ Its launch is . timed to coincide with the Icelandic mid-winter festival of Torrablst . (Thorrablot) held in honour of the Norse god, Thor. Brewery . owner, Dabjartur Arilmusson, declared: ‘This is a unique beer, brewed . in collaboration with Hvalur. Whale beer will include, among other . things, whale meal.’ Thor-sday drinks: Icelandic brewery Brugghús Steðja has teamed up with a whaling company to create a beer made with whale meal for the annual festival in honour of the god Thor (stock picture) Fitness first: Whale meal is a byproduct of commercial processing of whales and makes for 'a healthy drink' according to the microbrewery, as it is high in protein (file photo) The brewery also states that the beer is a healthy drink because ‘whale meal is very protein rich, and has almost no fat in it.’ ‘That, . along with the fact that no sugar is added makes this a very healthful . drink, and people will be true Vikings drinking it.’ Asked . if he was concerned that the product would fall foul of anti-whalers, . he commented: ‘Doubtless some people won't like it, there is a certain . risk and we are aware of that, but we hope Icelanders will like it as . we're naturally addressing it to Thorrablot, when people eat and drink . various things which they normally wouldn't.’ Last . year, the Whale and Dolphin Conservation helped expose the use of . endangered fin whales in dog food, and the use of fuel made from dead . fin whales to power Hvalur's own hunting vessels.","Icelandic brewery Brugghús Steðja is making beer with whale meal .

"By . Jessica Jerreat . A Texas father is suing several lacrosse coaches over claims that his son was kept out of high school games because of a 'pay for play' scheme. Attorney Bill Munck claimed in his lawsuit that coaches at a Dallas lacrosse academy threatened to give less time on the playing field unless players' parents paid for more training sessions. The Dallas lawyer said when he refused to give into demands for extra lessons at the private academies his son, also called Billy Munck, was kept on the bench at school matches. On the bench: Billy Munck with his son, of the same name, who he claims was refused playing time . Claims: Billy Munck claims his son was mostly kept on the bench during his sophomore year at high school . In a 39-page lawsuit, he claimed that coaches at Dallas Lacrosse Academy and Episcopal School of Dallas had broken federal anti-corruption laws. 'Through the use of illegal and . fraudulent conduct, including threats, intimidation and even extortion, . defendants have tried to ensure that student athletes who want to play . lacrosse in North Texas have to pay for play and have to go through the . defendants' enterprise,' the lawsuit, seen by Fox News, claimed. It went on to claim that Billy had been a victim of 'this criminal enterprise' while playing for his school. During his sophomore year, the lacrosse fan was kept mostly on the bench by coach Kevin Barnicle. Accusations: Kevin Barnicle is one of six lacrosse coaches named in the lawsuit . His family claim it was because they had not taken part in classes offered by the for-profit Dallas Lacrosse Academy, which Mr Barnicle was part of. The lawsuit added that the family were acting to ensure 'others, including Billyâ€™s younger . brother  ... do not suffer a similar fate.' The Muncks claimed that lacrosse academies, and six coaches including Mr Barnicle, threatened to cut playing time on high school teams for students if their parents didn't send them to costly private camps or training sessions. It was alleged that the high school coaches tried to use their position to boost attendance at the academies where they also worked. The Dallas Lacrosse Academy is also accused in the lawsuit of asking better players to replace weaker team members and to play in recruiting tournaments under other player's names. In a statement made to Mail Online, the family said: 'Filing this lawsuit was an absolute last resort and is not something that the Munck family took lightly. 'Mr Munck was the volunteer lead coach of a not-for-profit . lacrosse program for the North Texas Chapter of US Lacrosse. 'There . were more than a 150 kids in this program from all walks of life. The . defendants ""asked"" that the Muncks abandon their support for this . not-for-profit program so that the majority of these kids (those whose . families could afford to pay) would join the Dallas Lacrosse Academy. 'When . the Muncks refused to abandon this North Texas program, their son was . prevented from playing by the defendants, and ultimately transferred . schools.' The family claimed that other children and families were also affected by the alleged 'pay for play' scheme. The coaches and academies named in the lawsuit have not yet responded to a request for comment. The coaches told the Dallas Observer that they deny the allegations and that this is the second lawsuit the family has tried to bring against them.","Billy Munck brings lawsuit after son was kept on bench for school games .

"The body found in an Indiana lake on Sunday is that of missing Michigan doctor Teleka Patrick, an autopsy has confirmed. A Porter County coroner today said the 30-year-old's body was pulled from Lake Charles in the state's northwest, near where her car was abandoned along Interstate 94 in December. Her body was spotted by a fisherman. Kalamazoo County Sheriff Richard Fuller . said there were . no signs of trauma or foul play, and the initial . cause of death appeared to be drowning. However an investigation is still underway to determine the cause of death, with toxicology results pending. Scroll down for video . Confirmed: An autopsy has revealed it was the body of Dr Teleka Patrick, 30 (pictured), that was pulled from an Indiana lake on Sunday . Scene: Authorities say Patrick's body was found in Lake Charles, in northwest . Indiana, near where her car was abandoned in December . Michigan authorities say Patrick, who was last seen on December 6, . behaved strangely and erratically with colleagues and others in the . hours before her disappearance. She was last seen trying to get a . room at a Kalamazoo hotel. She didn't stay there and got a ride back to . her car at Borgess Medical Center. Patrick had been in Michigan since . last summer when she started a medical residency at Borgess. Grammy-nominated . gospel singer Marvin Sapp, 46, had secured a personal protection order . against Patrick in September. Sapp, pastor of Lighthouse Full Life . Center Church in Grand Rapids, alleged that Patrick claimed to be his . wife, contacted his teenage children and had been to his home. He said . she had joined his church after moving from California. 'She has moved from CA to MI,' Sapp wrote in part in the PPO request. 'Joined my church, contacts my children, and has been to my home.' WOOD-TV . reported that Pastor Sapp had filed the PPO order in September, and . that he had 'over 400 page(s) of correspondence from her to which I have . never responded.' He added that Patrick’s stalking had gone on for at least a year prior to her moving to Michigan. Stalked: Pastor and gospel singer Marvin Sapp, 46 (pictured left and right) filed a personal . protection order against Teleka Patrick after she visited his home and . contacted his young children to get close to him . According to police, Dr Patrick worked a shift at Borgess on December 5 and had one of her colleagues drive her to the Radisson after work. Both her purse and cellphone were found left behind at work, and surveillance footage at the hotel shows her trying to get a room with cash, but not having enough money. In the footage, without . audio, Dr Patrick talks calmly with the front desk clerk for about 15 . minutes before leaving after not getting the room. She is then seen boarding a complimentary hotel shuttle back to her gold . Lexus parked at the medical center - the last time anyone saw her. 'It . was really sad to watch it because this is the last video record of her . before she went missing,' Teleka's sister Tenesha Patrick told WWMT. Just two hours later, Dr Patrick's . car was discovered abandoned in a ditch on the westbound side of 194, . more than 100 miles away in Portage, Indiana. The keys were missing from . the inside of the car. Trying to find a room: Dr Patrick is pictured walking up to the Radisson hotel in Kalamazoo after getting a ride there after work . Why was she there? Dr Patrick's family doesn't know why she was trying to book a room. Investigators later found she left both her phone and purse at work . No cards: Dr Patrick was caught on the hotel's surveillance cameras trying and failing to secure the room with cash . Dr Patrick was officially reported missing the next day when she failed to show up for work. One of her colleagues told investigators that she received a phone call that day and that her demeanor changed after she hung up. Dr Patrick's parents, who live in Florida, said she has a busy schedule but usually calls them once a week, usually on Sundays. They did not believe that their daughter was in a romantic relationship. Her family had asked the investigator handling another famous missing persons case, Mary Land, who disappeared ten years ago, to help find her. Dr Patrick's parents met with Jim Carlin of Justinian Investigative Services in Battle Creek, which agreed to work on the case. Leaving: The last time Dr Patrick is caught on surveillance cameras, she is seen boarding a complimentary hotel shuttle which took her back to the medical center where her car was parked . Accomplished: Dr Patrick (pictured left and right) had started her first year of residency in Kalamazoo after graduating from medical school last spring . Close to home: The hotel is located just five minutes from Dr Patrick's apartment . Her mother Irene told CNN: 'She has an outgoing personality ... she's a warm, friendly, lovely person to be around.' She added that her daughter had just bought a plane ticket to fly to Florida. 'Who was calling her, what was that about, does that have anything to do with her disappearance?' her sister asked.","An autopsy has confirmed Dr Teleka Patrick's body was pulled from Lake Charles in Indiana on Sunday morning .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Service for HBO GO subscribers went down Sunday night during one of the most anticipated premieres this year: Game of Thrones.

HBO GO acknowledged the problem on Twitter, advising subscribers that they were working on the problem, and instructing them to 'send a raven.'

The premium cable service blamed the technical difficulties on 'excessive volume' and promised to provide the episode on HBO on Demand shortly.Game of Thrones-themed jokes abounded on the Twitter, and many also noted that HBO GO's servers are likely overburdened due to millenials using their parents HBO accounts rather than purchasing subscriptions of their own.

Or I mean, get your mom, the HBO subscriber, to write a letter,' tweeted one Twitter user.HBO told The Hollywood Reporter in a statement later Sunday night: 'HBO GO did experience issues due to overwhelming demand around the premiere of Game of Thrones.

"By . Lizzie Parry . A woman shot her boyfriend in the face at point blank range at the Pennsylvania home they shared, before tampering with the crime scene to make it look like a suicide, a court heard. Jessica Alinsky initially claimed Matthew Gailie shot himself during a violent row at their home near Hazleton in September 2011. After a desperate 911 call by Alinksy on the night of September 2, 2011, police and paramedics discovered Mr Gailie dead on the living room floor with a gunshot wound to the face. Confession: Jessica Alinsky has pleaded guilty to third-degree murder after her boyfriend Matthew Gailie was found dead at the home their shared in Pennsylvania in September 2011 . When questioned, Alinksy gave four different versions of what happened. The death remained under investigation for years, but in July last year a coroner's inquest determined Mr Gailie did not commit suicide but was murdered. The jury claimed Alinksy was the killer, having fired the gun at point blank range, inches from her boyfriend's face. Giving evidence at the inquest, Alinsky chose to invoke her Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. In November District Judge Jamie Dixon in Hazle Township ruled that there was enough evidence to send the case to trial. But on Wednesday, Alinksy pleaded guilty to third-degree murder and now faces up to 40 years in jail. Happier times: Mr Gailie, 34, (pictured with his sister) was found on the living room floor with a gun shot wound to his face. Alinsky initially claimed he had committed suicide . Moments later she told reporters she didn't commit the crime, citizenvoice.com reported. She said: 'I would never hurt him. Time will tell, and the truth will come out.' Luzerne County Judge Tina Polachek Gartley told the court Alinsky will be sentenced on May 16. State troopers investigating the shooting said they suspected Alinsky almost immediately, refusing to believe it was suicide. A spokesman said the body had been moved and the blood spatter did not fall in line with Mr Gailie having committed suicide. Frank Gailie, the victim's father, told Eyewitness News: 'We knew it just wasn't right from the start. 'My son did not change from a young man to the time of his death.'","Matthew Gailie was found with a gun shot would to his face on the living room floor at the couple's Pennsylvania home in September 2011 .

"By . Suzannah Hills . Anthony Dunne, 19, had been having an affair with mother-of-two Anita Setz, 43, pictured, who was his counsellor at a young offenders institution . A teenage inmate hanged himself after having an affair with a 43-year-old mother volunteering as a prison counsellor, an inquest has heard. Anthony Dunne, 19, began sleeping with the mother-of-two just weeks after he was released on licence from a young offenders institution. But the relationship spiralled out of control when Dunne returned late to his probation hostel. Fearing he would be jailed again, Dunne - who had a psychiatric disorder - fled and lived with Anita Setz. But after three weeks, he ran out of his anti-psychotic medication and attacked Ms Setz who was forced to jump out of an upstairs window to escape him. Ms Setz was rushed to hospital where she underwent surgery for more than five hours to treat her injuries while Dunne was arrested. An inquest heard Dunne was taken to Rochester young offenders' institution, Kent, where he took his own life despite being on hourly suicide watch. Ms Setz told the inquest in Maidstone, Kent, she met Dunne when he was serving a sentence for actual bodily harm and gave him counselling on behalf of a charity called Starting Point. Ms Setz, who is divorced and has two sons then aged 13 and 15, said Dunne begged for her phone number at the end of their counselling sessions. She said: 'I think at the time I was actually quite flattered by his advances. He was really humorous, he made me cry with laughter.' Ms Setz started visiting Dunne near his probation hostel in Basildon, Essex, every fortnight. She said: 'He was attracted to me, he made it clear.' The first time she brought Dunne to her village home near Tunbridge Wells, Kent, he was friendly and got on well with her children. At the end of August 2004, she dropped him back 40 minutes after curfew to the hostel. He fled, paranoid he would be sent back to jail. She said: 'I said ""I will come back and get you but only if you will agree that you will get in touch with your probation officer tomorrow"".' But the next day was a bank holiday and by Tuesday he was convinced he would be imprisoned. Ms Setz said: 'I didn't contact anyone because I thought number one, the repercussions for him, and number two, the repercussions for me.' Hearing: The inquest at Archbishops Palace, Maidstone, comes nine years after Dunne's death and is ongoing . She said he was happy at first, but Dunne gradually became more paranoid. She said: 'He was growing really suspicious about what I was doing, where I was and whether I was likely to call the police.' The couple had been living together for three weeks when Dunne starting drinking heavily on a night out at the cinema to see Collateral Damage on September 20, 2004. Ms Setz's friend was looking after her two boys and Dunne attacked Ms Setz when she tried to leave to join them. Eventually she distracted him and jumped from her bedroom window, still in high heels, to escape. Nick Brown, counsel for Dunne's family, told her: 'You knew, didn't you, that you had to maintain professional boundaries?' She admitted she had been in the wrong, but said: 'It isn't uncommon for counsellors or clinicians to develop strong emotional ties and feelings for the clients and vice versa. 'That 19-year-old was dangerous, he was courageous, forthright, opinionated - he was not just a naive innocent 19-year-old lad.' Ms Setz tried giving counselling again after the incident but soon gave it up, she told the jury. She is now working as a self-employed horse box driver and a valeter of mobile homes, with no intention ever to return to counselling. Colleagues had been raising concerns about her lack of boundaries with clients for about a year, the inquest heard. After the affair she was banned from entering Rochester Young Offenders' Institution. Meanwhile, public officials have been criticised for taking nine years to hold the inquest. It is believed the delay was due to the complex nature of the case combined with a severe backlog among Kent's coroners. In 2011 inspectors said it was 'unacceptable' that the inquest into Dunne's death had still not been held. The inquest continues.

"By . Jill Reilly . Police are searching a landfill site for a £2.2million painting that had just sold at auction in Hong Kong when cleaners accidentally threw it away. The 2012 painting Snowy Mountain, by Chinese artist Cui Ruzhuo, was reported missing by auctioneers Poly Auction on Tuesday afternoon after the auction on Monday. Ming Pao newspaper reported that police had checked CCTV footage at the Grand Hyatt hotel, where the auction took place, which showed cleaners removing the painting. Police are searching a landfill site for a £2.2million painting that had just sold at auction after Hong Kong cleaners accidentally threw it away . The 2012 painting Snowy Mountain, by Chinese artist, pictured, Cui Ruzhuo, was reported missing by Chinese auctioneers Poly Auction on Tuesday afternoon after the auction on Monday . That raised fears that the painting had been sent out with the garbage to the city's landfill. Police told AFP a theft case was reported on Tuesday by an auction house staff member regarding a painting, without giving further details. A Grant Hyatt spokeswoman would not confirm if the painting had been dumped as trash but said hotel staff did not handle items sold at the auction because they were too expensive. She said in an emailed statement to AFP that organisers would hire their own security and contractors for such events involving 'high-value' items. A Grant Hyatt (pictured)  spokeswoman would not confirm if the painting had been dumped as rubbish but said hotel staff did not handle items sold at the auction because they were too expensive . Poly Culture did not comment immediately when contacted by AFP. The spring sale was the first major auction organised by Poly Culture in Hong Kong following its stock debut in March. Poly Culture Group, the world's third largest auction house by revenue behind Sotheby's and Christie's, is a subsidiary of state-run conglomerate Poly Group. On Tuesday, a rare Ming Dynasty 'chicken cup' broke world auction records for Chinese porcelain after it sold for HK$281.2 million ($36.3 million/£21.6 million) at a Sotheby's sale in Hong Kong, exceeding the $32.4 million paid for a Qing double-gourd vase in 2010.","The 2012 painting Snowy Mountain was by Chinese artist Cui Ruzhuo .

"By . Martin Robinson . A new ban on cheap alcohol is already failing because high-strength booze is still being sold for less than a bottle of water, experts said today. Since Monday retailers have been unable to sell lager or cider . for less than 50p a can after ministers promised a new minimum pricing regime to end the ‘worst examples of harmful drink’. Shops in Blackpool, Britain's worst town for alcohol-related illnesses and deaths, are selling cans of 7.5 per cent strength cider for 89p, while bottled water on their shelves is the same price or more. Row: Omega strong cider is being sold for 89p a can at Buy Low bargains in Blackpool, right, . Although this 89p price is above the new threshold, shocked health officials have said that David Cameron should already re-think his policy to save lives. An investigation has found that at least . three shops in the seaside resort sold high-strength cans of cider or lager for . less or the same price as a bottle of water. Buy Low Bargains, close to the pier, sells Omega Cider for 89p. Its . manager Sam Meak defended the policy and said: 'They are alcoholics so . they don’t mind if they buy it cheap or whatever, they would buy the . cider if it was £20'. The seaside resort is Britain's poorest and most deprived in terms of income, employment and health problems. Alcohol . is widely blamed and in the past two years 2,914 people were admitted . to hospital with alcohol-related illnesses and 140 died - the highest . figures by population in Britain. The town's Victoria Hospital says it has seen an increase in the number of people being rushed there in alcohol-induced comas or liver failure. NHS Blackpool's alcohol lead Steve Morton said: 'Minimum prices . would have minimal effect on the average person – something like 12p a . week – but it would deter young vulnerable people from buying cheap, . strong alcohol. 'High strength, low cost alcohol tends to be . drunk by people with an alcohol problem and younger people who want to . get as much alcohol as cheaply as possible because they have limited . means. 'Minimum prices need to come in through legislation, but . in the mean time responsible traders should be looking at stopping . selling strong alcohol. The industry needs to take some . responsibility – a dead customer is no customer at all'. Admissions: By population more people are taken Blackpool's Victoria Hospital with alcohol-related illnesses than anywhere else in Britain . Blackpool's public health chief, Dr Arif Rajpura, has called on David Cameron to rethink minimum pricing to save lives. Under his original plans a can of lager would have retailed for £1.56, wine for £4.22 and spirits for £12.60. But the Prime Minister faced strong opposition from within the Cabinet, as ministers warned it could unfairly hit responsible drinkers on lower incomes. So the Prime Minister’s proposal – which would have fixed the cost of a unit of alcohol at 45p – was dumped last summer. Instead cans must be at least 50p each, bottles of wine £2.24 and 750ml bottles of vodka or whisky £10.16. The new system works by banning shops and pubs from selling alcohol at less than the total cost of the duty payable to the Treasury, plus VAT. But experts say it will have a minimal effect. On average, each adult is expected to drink just 0.04 per cent less over the course of the year. So-called ‘hazardous drinkers’ – those who consume more than the recommend safe limits – are predicted to consume just 0.1 per cent less. But Dr Sarah Wollaston, MP for Totnes and campaigner on alcohol pricing, said the effect of the new regime would be ‘minuscule’. ‘I just do not think the evidence is there to support it when you are comparing it with the effect of minimum unit pricing,’ she said.","Since Monday shops must sell cans of lager or cider for at least 50p each .

"By . Damien Gayle . A dentist who bought one of John Lennon's rotten teeth at auction for nearly £20,000 now wants to use it to create a clone of the assassinated musician. Dentist Michael Zuk, 51, from Alberta in Canada, who bought the Beatle’s molar by telephone bid at an auction two years ago, announced his plan on BBC radio this morning. He told BBC Radio 5 Live breakfast: 'Many people have thought about cloning famous people and I think John Lennon should be at the top of the heap.' Yellow: John Lennon's tooth, which dentist Michael Zuk from Canada wants to use to clone the Beatle . Mr Zuk said that the next step would be to extract Lennon's genetic sequence from the yellowed wisdom tooth he had in his position. 'From there its just a matter of sitting around waiting for the technology to advance just a little bit longer because they are already cloning animals from small amounts of DNA,' he added. 'So we have some time to think about all the different considerations.' Assassinated: Lennon, who was shot dead in 1980, gave the tooth to his housekeeper after he had it pulled. It was put up for auction in 2011 by her son . He went on: 'When people are doing genetic clones they actually get an exact replica of the person or animal that they are bringing back. 'I believe they are doing it with race horses already and with people's favourite pets, so it's already being done.' John Lennon gave the tooth to his housekeeper Dorothy Jarlett, who between 1964 and 1968 lived in Weybridge, Surrey. She later moved to Canada where she married and had kept it with her ever since. The Beatle's former employee is now 90 and her son Barry Jarlett decided to sell it so that the 'unique' piece of memorabilia is not lost. John Lennon, who was shot dead in 1980, formed a close bond with Miss Jarlett. He also gave her a pearl necklace and a wallet which the family are planning to keep. The pensioner provided an affidavit to confirm that the tooth was genuine. Mr Zuk bought the tooth, which he says is probably a wisdom tooth, after it was sold through Omega Auctions in Stockport, Greater Manchester, in 2011. At the time he said he was ‘buzzing’ after the purchase, adding that it would join his collection of dinosaur teeth.","Michael Zuk says Lennon is 'top of the heap' of people who should be cloned .

"By . John Hall . Accused: Anthony McGraw, 40, allegedly poured a large amount of hot grease over his girlfriend . A woman has been left permanently disfigured after her boyfriend allegedly poured boiling fat on her face while she slept. Anthony McGraw, 40, fled the couple's home in Tuscaloosa, Alabama after pouring a large amount of hot grease over his girlfriend, 39, while upset over the state of their relationship, according to police. He was later found hiding in a nearby abandoned building, and now faces a charge of first-degree domestic violence assault, while the unidentified victim is thought likely to require cosmetic surgery. The incident happened at the couple's home in west of the city at around 4am on Sunday. McGraw had apparently been cooking before deciding to use the oil as a weapon, according to Tuscaloosa County Metro Homicide Unit's Lieutenant Kip Hart. 'He was cooking a meal and she was asleep on the couch when he came across some information that made him upset enough to do this... Based on what we know, we don’t think it was premeditated,' he told Tuscaloosa News. It is believed the victim had two children at the property at the time of the attack, including a teenager to which McGraw is the father. The victim was transported to UAB Hospital in Birmingham, where she is being treated for severe but non life-threatening burns to her face and arms. 'My understanding is her injuries are quite severe as far as she'll probably need cosmetic surgery,' Lieutenant Hart said. Scene: The incident happened at the couple's home (pictured) in west of the city at around 4am on Sunday.

McGraw had left the scene by the time police arrived, but he was later found cowering in a nearby abandoned building at around 7pm the following evening. He has been charged with first degree assault - a crime described as an attack 'with intent to disfigure another person seriously and permanently' - and is held on a $60,000 bond. A judge . revoked his probation on a 2009 felony marijuana possession charge and a . 2006 drug distribution charge. He is being held with no bond set in . those cases. The couple's relationship problems are thought to date back at least until last August when the victim told police that McGraw had threatened her. A subsequent restraining order against McGraw was dismissed a month later.","Anthony McGraw, 40, allegedly poured boiling fat over sleeping girlfriend .

"By . Ted Thornhill . A dog shot and left to die in a crate in the Colorado Desert in California was saved after emergency surgery in which vets removed part of her lung. Lab-pitbull cross Shadow was found abandoned with another dog that had died and frozen solid overnight. The animals were surrounded by gun cartridges. X-Ray: Vets found a 40-calibre bullet lodged in Shadow's chest (left) after the animal had been rehomed with ex-convict Robbie Miller (right) Two-year-old Shadow was rescued by Zach Skow - director of Marley's Mutts Dog Rescue – who rehabilitated her and rehomed her with Robbie Miller, who had just been released from 12 years in prison. The 34-year-old former gang-member's life was transformed when he adopted two-year-old Shadow - who helped him adapt to life in the real world. After a few weeks of blissful bonding between Mr Miller and Shadow, however, she began to cough up blood. Caring: A visibly downbeat Shadow with Mr Miller after surgery to remove the bullet . Shocking: The bullet that was found in Shadow (left) and the dog after recovering from the operation (right) Mr Miller sent Shadow to the hospital for x-rays and blood work which revealed that she had been shot and had a bullet lodged in her chest. Mr Miller was absolutely devastated that Shadow was sick and was prepared to do whatever it took to make her well again. Mr Miller said: ‘When I got out of prison, my social skills were terrible - I knew that people would judge me for the bad things I'd done in my past, but that a dog wouldn't care. ‘She is the love of my life and it would be unbearable to be without her.’ Expenses paid: Shadow's surgery cost $15,000 but the cost was covered by donations that came in from around the world . An apparent picture of health: Shadow (left) before the bullet was found . The dog rescue team located a hospital that was primed to deal with the incredibly expensive kind of emergency surgery Shadow would inevitably need. Just out of prison - Mr Miller didn't have the funds for such an expensive operation - but a fund-raising page was set up and generous pledges from across the globe started pouring in. At an animal hospital in west Los Angeles, a surgeon removed a 40-caliber bullet from Shadow's body, along with a portion of her lung. Against all odds, including a severe bleed during surgery, Shadow survived and Mr Miller spent all his time by her bed-side. The imaging, 24/7 care, specialist consultation, medications and surgery cost nearly $15,000, - raised through the incredible generosity of strangers captivated by the pair’s heart-wrenching story. Mr Miller said: ‘In prison, if you show your feelings, people will prey on you. ‘But Shadow has taught me that love conquers all, and she has broken my walls down so that I can feel a kind of love I never knew before. ‘She is the love of my life, and I know that with her by my side, I can be a good person and do good things in this world.’","Two-year-old Lab-pitbull Shadow was left to die in the Colorado Desert .

"By . Jessica Jerreat . Jailed: Nicholas Cheese has been sentenced to 17 years in prison after assaulting a 13-year-old girl . A 27-year-old from the UK was jailed for 17 years on Monday after filming himself sexually assaulting a 13-year-old girl from Maine who he befriended in a Harry Potter chat room. Nicholas Cheese was found guilty of abusing the Levant girl over three days in a motel room in Bangor, Maine, in June last year. As the judge jailed Cheese, from Wolvercote near Oxford, he condemned the businessman for subjecting the young girl to 'a range of sexual experiences many adults would refuse to explore'. Cheese, who worked in the dry cleaning industry, had befriended the victim, who has not been identified, through an online chat room for fans of the Harry Potter children's books when she was 12. He arranged to meet the girl at his motel room, when he traveled to the U.S. for a business trip, and admitted to police he knew she was only 13. Cheese was found guilty of one count of producing pornography after filming his final encounter with the child. Initial charges from his arrest on July 1, of gross sexual assault and sexual exploitation of a minor, were dismissed in September when his case moved from state to federal court. The victim did not appear in court, but her father spoke on her behalf, telling Judge John Woodcock that his daughter had met Cheese when she was recovering from a life-threatening illness. Cheese is said to have helped the girl through the illness, details of which were not revealed, then arranged to meet her while on his way to a conference in Texas. 'My daughter is more upset about what . happened afterward,' he said of Cheese’s prosecution. 'She feels like she lost her best friend.' Assault: Cheese flew to Bangor in Maine from his Oxford home so he could meet the 13-year-old . The judge said that although the sex would be considered consensual if it had been between adults, he said the victim was not a '13-year-old who looked like she was 18', the Bangor Daily News reported. He added: 'The defendant’s actions against this 13-year-old girl were unusually aggressive.' Fan site: Cheese met his victim through an online chat room for Harry Potter fans . As he sentenced Cheese to 17 years in prison and five years of supervised release, he said: 'When [Cheese] met her, he gave her a crash . course in sex. 'In a matter of three days, he exposed her to a range of . sexual experiences many adults would refuse to explore.' Cheese wept as his parents, who had . flown to the U.S. for his hearing, addressed the court and pleaded for . leniency for their son. His father lives in Britain and his mother has a . home in Spain. The victim's father had contacted police on June 30 last year to say that his daughter had been sexually assaulted by a man from the UK. Detective Andrew Whitehouse and Detective Brent Beaulieu interviewed Cheese at the motel he was staying in, and later arrested him and confiscated his passport. During questioning Cheese admitted he had gone to Bangor to have sex with the 13-year-old, and that he had previously got her to send explicit pictures and videos to him. The images and footage, and a sexually explicit photo taken in the motel room, were found on Cheese's cellphone, according to court documents. Child pornography was also found on his home computer by police in the UK. It is not clear if he will face charges relating to those images. He is expected to be deported at the end of his prison term in the U.S.","Nicholas Cheese has been sentenced to 17 years in prison for assault .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Accused: Christopher Sefton allegedly starved and beat his six-year-old son for months . A six-year-old boy was starved, beaten and only fed gruesome hot dog, carrot and oil 'shakes' by his abusive parents, prosecutors have claimed. The boy's father, Christopher Sefton, and his wife Lori Lloyd allegedly abused the boy for months at their Auburn, Washington home - even keeping the child out of school to hide his bruises. The couple, who allegedly began abusing the boy in October as punishment for imagined misbehavior, now face felony charges, the Seattle Post Intelligencer reported. They were arrested after a child . protective services worker at the boy's school reported that he showed . signs of abuse, including quick weight loss and bruising to his face. The . boy, who has not been named, told detectives that he was bruised after . Sefton punched him for putting food on a car seat as he tied his shoe, . according to court papers. He . also told child welfare workers that he had no been fed for several . nights, while school staff also reported that he had been stealing food . from other children or digging through the trash for food. The child 'constantly states that he is hungry', a detective wrote in charging papers.

"By . Snejana Farberov . and Helen Pow . An obese 12-year-old with diabetes has lost 6lbs and is off insulin thanks to drastic weight loss surgery paid for in part through an online crowd-funding campaign. Alexis Shapiro was diagnosed with a rare brain tumor in 2011 and the treatment left her with a conditon called hypothalamic obesity - basically she gained 151lbs in less than two years. After their insurance initially rejected bariatric surgery for the girl, her mother, Jenny Shapiro, reached out to donors on Gofundme.com, and managed to rise more than $86,000 to cover medical expenses. The Cibolo, Texas tween went under the knife March 21, and her mom says she's recovering well from the gastric sleeve surgery. 'Her diabetes is pretty much gone,' Mrs Shapiro told People. 'She is off insulin.' Lost weight: The Cibolo, Texas tween Alexis Shapiro, pictured this week, went under the knife March 21, and her mom says she's recovering well from the gastric sleeve surgery . The thrilled parent said her daughter's mood has also improved. 'She looks healthier and has more energy,' she said. 'The other day she pushed herself to climb three flights of stairs.' Doctors hope the 4'7"" school girl will lose as much as 50lbs thanks to the surgery, which reduced the size of her stomach to a quarter of its original size. According to People, Alexis was booked in for a gastric bypass at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center but due to complications they changed tack and proceeded with sleeve gastrectomy surgery. The 12-year-old still can't have solid foods and gets full very easily, but she is on the road to recovery. 'Of course she wants to be healed and done with everything,' Mrs Shapiro said, 'but each day gets better.' The mom is posting updates on Alexis' shrinking size on Facebook. Alexis' long-awaited gastric bypass last month had to be scrapped because of her enlarged liver. Staff at the Cincinnati hospital shared on Twitter that the surgeons could not proceed with the gastric bypass because the 203lbs 12-year-old's liver turned out to be bigger than they had anticipated, and the operation was no longer the safest option for the girl. Felling better: 'She looks healthier and has more energy,' her mom said. 'The other day she pushed herself to climb three flights of stairs' Sealed with a kiss: Jenny Shapiro is seen giving her daughter, Alexis, a kiss as the 12-year-old is being wheeled into the operating room at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center for her gastric bypass surgery last month . Getting ready: These photos posted on Twitter show surgical instruments being laid out and Drs Inge and Helmrath scrubbing in . As . an alternative, the medical team decided to proceed with what they . called a staged approach, opting for a sleeve gastrecomy: a weigh-loss . procedure where the stomach is permanently reduced to 25 per cent of its . original size. Dr Thomas Inge, who headed the team of surgeons in the operating room, explained that they were unable to proceed as planned because Alexis' liver was too stiff and immovable for them to clearly see inside the stomach. Inge said a senior surgeon went out to the waiting area and broke the news to Jenny and Ian Shapiro, Alexis' parents, telling them that they will have to go ahead with a back-up plan. 'They were not disappointed,' the doctor recalled. 'I think they were surprised that we had to go with plan B.' The surgeons were able to nudge Alexis' oversize liver just enough to expose the left side of the stomach and cut away about 80 per cent of it, leaving a narrow 'sleeve' roughly the shape and size of a banana. Before: Alexis, pictured in happier times, was a normal little girl until she had surgery to treat a brain tumor . Common: The weight gain is a common side effect of the brain surgery she underwent . Young and fit: If Alexis gets the surgery she may be able to lead a normal life again and keep off the weight . 'We were very pleased with the outcome of the operation,' Inge said. 'So it was not disappointing at all.' While the hospital had announced on social media earlier in the day that the gastric bypass will take place at a later time, this afternoon Dr Inge said that the jury is still out on whether or not the surgery will go forward - it will all depend on Alexis' progress. He explained that while sleeve gastrectomy is considered to be an effective and increasingly popular weight-loss option, Alexis may not be able to lose as much weight as with a bypass. If the 12-year-old does manage to shed enough pounds in the first year to 18 months to significantly reduce the size of her fatty liver, her doctors will evaluate her again and weigh all the pros and cons of a second surgery. The operation would entail converting the gastrectomy into a bypass by connecting Alexis' small intestine to her stomach 'sleeve.' 'I think she will have a new normal,' the surgeon said, responding to a question about Alexis' future. Obese: Alexis is pictured before her weight loss surgery . Health problems: Alexis required medical attention on her way to Ohio (left), and she landed in the ER in February (right) after complaining of chest pains . Step by step: Alexis, pictured here with her parents prior to surgery, remains hospitalized . Second chance: Alexis' mother said she hopes her daughter finally would be able to ride a bike and go swimming in the summer like other kids her age . The 12-year-old's father, Ian Shapiro, described the experience as a roller coaster ride for their family. According to her doctors, without the surgery Alexis would have continued putting on 2lbs a week and eventually become immobile despite a strict daily regimen comprised of diet and exercise. If her condition was left untreated, Alexis soon would have tipped the scales at whopping 400lbs. The weight-loss surgery, which diminishes the size of the stomach and shortens the vagus nerve that control appetite, will help the girl feel more sated with less food. But the procedure performed on such young a patient is not without its risks, chief among them is the fragility of the metabolic system in children suffering from hypothalamic obesity. Dr Inge estimates that his young . patient will be able to lose 20 per cent of her weight - about 40lbs - . in the first year after the surgery. Alexis' parents, who also have two younger daughters, say they do not consider . the surgery a magic bullet that will solve all of their daughter's . health problems at once. Miracle worker: Doctor Thomas Inge, from Children's Hospital Medical Center, led the team of surgeons who operated on Alexis . Mrs . Shapiro says she simply wants her 12-year-old to be able to ride a bike . like other kids, go swimming with her siblings and walk around without . drawing stares from strangers. The . family said they have been overwhelmed with support from well-wishers . from around the world, who have donated more than $86,000 toward Alexis' medical care, travel costs and living expenses through the Shapiros' online fundraising campaign. Whatever remains of the fund will go towards helping other sick children, Jenny Shapiro said earlier this year. Alexis' life-threatening condition was triggered by surgery she had two years ago to remove a benign brain tumor called craniopharnygioma. During the operation, her hypothalamus and pituitary gland, which help govern appetite and weight, were damaged. She now feels constantly hungry and her weight has caused other medical conditions. After her brain surgery, Alexis' parents had to take extreme measures to keep their daughter from eating herself to death. 'She's always hungry,' her father Ian Shapiro said. 'In the past, we've had to padlock the cupboard.' In . just the past four months, Alexis was hospitalized for a kidney . infection and developed Type 2 diabetes that requires nightly insulin . injections. More than half of children with the specific form of tumor Alexis had experience similar post-operative symptoms. Alexis may be a child, but she wears a women's size 2XL . and she goes up a size every month. When asked by psychologists about . how she is coping with her condition, she has told them she 'wants to . die.' After TRICARE, a . military health insurance, rejected the family's initial request for . coverage, citing a lack of detail in the application about Alexis' condition, the young girl's family was afraid the appeal process would . take longer than she had. 'These kids will literally eat themselves to death,' Jenny Shapiro said. 'That's what I'm scared of.' The . outpouring of love and funds on the 'Hope for Alexis' GoFundMe page . gave hope to Alexis, whose condition has caused her to withdraw into her . shell. She is now home-schooled and has no friends. 'I hope this will be the beginning of the end of all of her . pain and insecurities,' Jenny Shapiro wrote in a blog post. 'I hope she won't have to endure another day . feeling like she is starving. I hope she will be able to think about fun . things, not just when she will get to eat next.'","Alexis Shapiro, from Cibolo, Texas, was diagnosed with a rare brain tumor in 2011 .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . and Alex Brummer In Washington . Britain is storming ahead of all other . major economies, with a new prediction for faster growth leading to . claims the UK is now the 'Mo Farah of the global race'. The . International Monetary Fund said it now expects a 2.9 per cent rate of . growth in 2014, a major u-turn after previously warning George Osborne . his austerity programme was 'playing with fire'. It . means Britain is now on course to grow faster than any of the G7 . richest countries, including the US, Germany and France, leading to the . comparison with Olympic gold medalist Farah. The International Monetary Fund said the UK economy was on course to grow by 2.9 per cent this year, faster than any other G7 country . Chancellor George Osborne, on a visit to Brazil this week, is delighted to see Britain punching above its weight . Only a year ago, the IMF heavily . criticised the Chancellor’s economic plans and said he was ‘playing with . fire’ by pressing ahead with austerity policies. It cut its UK . forecasts to 0.7 per cent for 2013 and 1.5 per cent for 2014. But . in a highly unusual mea culpa yesterday, its chief economist, Olivier . Blanchard, admitted that the IMF’s earlier prediction was ‘too . pessimistic’. He conceded that the UK economy grew by 1.8 per cent in . 2013 and raised growth forecasts to 2.9 per cent for 2014. The . latest World Economic Outlook gives its backing to policies . pursued by the Chancellor and Bank of England governor Mark Carney. It puts Britain ahead of the US . on 2.8 per cent, Germany on 1.7 per cent and Canada at 2.3 per cent. The . new figures also upgrade UK growth for next year though they still . predict it will be slower than this year. ‘Consumption . and residential investment looked like a rather unbalanced way of . growing but I think forward-looking investment seems to be coming back . and growth is going to be more balanced, so indeed that is very good . news,’ Mr Blanchard said. Charts in . the IMF’s report suggest that US interest rates will start to rise in . 2015 and that those in Britain will not be far behind. The . bright forecast came as Britain’s Office for National Statistics . produced data showing manufacturing rose strongly in February by 1 per . cent, after losing some momentum in January because of the effect of . heavy rain and flooding. In a . further boost, the National Institute of Economic and Social Research . said total economic output grew by 0.9 per cent in the first three . months of this year – the strongest performance since the second quarter . of 2010. The IMF forecast is a major vindication for Mr Osborne after being warned he was 'playing with fire' Mr Osborne, who is on an export drive in Brazil, was clearly elated by the IMF projections. 'It is good news that the IMF forecasts . that Britain is to grow faster and has been upgraded by them by more . than any other Western economy this year, and that record numbers of . jobs are being created,' he said. ‘It . is proof that the economic plan is working. But we need to . do more to get exports and investment going. That is what the Budget was . all about and that is what I am doing in Brazil this week. 'And it . is clear today that the growth deniers in the Labour Party are intent on . talking down the British economy - and that is the greatest risk to . recovery.' Remarkably, the IMF believes that the main risk to its new forecast is that the UK will do even better than expected. It . expects the UK’s economic renaissance to continue into 2015, with gross . domestic product – the total output of the economy – expected to power . ahead by a further 2.5 per cent. James Sproule, Chief Economist at the Institute of Directors, said: 'The IMF’s previous economic forecasts have been too pessimistic because they were convinced that cuts to state spending would have a serious negative effect on GDP growth. Fortunately for Britain, this fear has proved to be misplaced.' And Ruth Porter, head of economic and social policy at Policy Exchange, said: 'Britain is now the Mo Farah of the global race. 'We are leading the rest of the developed world in terms of economic recovery but the race is a marathon not a sprint. 'The flexibility of our labour market has enabled us to weather the economic downturn better than most other countries. But the challenge now is to raise our ambition still further.' But Labour's shadow chancellor Ed Balls said: 'These forecasts are welcome news after three damaging years when the economy flatlined and growth forecasts were repeatedly downgraded. 'Yet millions of working people, who are on average £1,600 a year worse off since 2010, are still not feeling any recovery at all.' Official figures showed the economy grew by 0.7 per cent in the last three months of 2013, the fourth quarter of growth in a row. Another estimate of UK GDP released today by the respected . think tank the National Institute for Economic and Social Research suggested . economic output grew by 0.9 per cent in the three months ending in March. The . NIESR said the robust growth was relatively broad based. It forecast . economic growth for this year of 2.5 per cent and 2.1 per cent for 2015. But it added that even though the level of economic output . had almost regained its pre-recession peak, a sizeable negative output gap . remains. The pound surged again on the news, having already seen a boost today from strong official manufacturing figures. Sterling ticked higher versus the dollar to $1.675 - close to a 51-month high of $1.680 set in February - having opening London trading at just $1.661. Remarkably, the IMF believes that the main risk to its forecast is that the UK will do even better than expected. The Fund expects the UK’s economic . renaissance to continue into 2015, the election year, with gross . domestic product – the total output of the economy – expected to power . ahead by a further 2.5 per cent. The . upbeat IMF assessment of Britain’s prospects will provide a boost to . the Chancellor, who is due to arrive in Washington on Thursday. The World Economic Outlook reports says: ‘Downside risks continue to dominate global growth outlook, notwithstanding some upside risks in the United States, the United Kingdom and Germany,’ The Fund says the main risks are from ‘low inflation and the possibility of protracted low growth especially in the euro area and Japan’. Nevertheless, the IMF forecasts that the recovery from the Great Recession will continue across the globe this year with output strengthening from 3 per cent last year to 3.5 per cent in 2014 and 3.9 per cent in 2015.","World Economic Outlook predicts UK will grow faster than G7 countries .

"By . Associated Press . A six-month-old female giraffe with a terminal heart defect has died during a surgery that had never been attempted on its species. Kyah, a giraffe at Oklahoma City Zoo, had an extra blood vessel wrapped around her esophagus — a symptom of a congenital heart defect — that prevented her from holding down solid food. Kyah, a giraffe at the Oklahoma City Zoo, sits on the ground as she grazes at the zoo. She died on the operating table when surgeons were unable to save her from complications . The surgery took place at Oklahoma State University's Veterinary Medical Hospital. The zoo’s vet, Dr Gretchen Cole said before the surgery that, at best, Kyah had a 50 per cent chance of survival. Candice Rennels, a spokesman for the zoo, said Kyah was euthanized during surgery when surgeons realized she would not overcome complications. Six-month-old Kyah, a giraffe at the Oklahoma City Zoo, stands next to her mother, Ellie, at the zoo in Oklahoma City, on April 4 . Kyah, pictured with her mother, needed to undergo the surgery as she was struggling to keep down any solid food. Despite the problem, she appeared normal to zoo visitors . ‘The zoo family is grateful to our colleagues at OSU's Veterinary Medical Hospital for their expertise and hard work,’ said Dr. Jennifer D'Agostino, zoo director of veterinary services. ‘We knew going into this procedure that Kyah's chances were extremely low and we felt we gave her every chance possible to thrive. Collaborations such as these also allow us to learn more about the species in our care.’ The four-hour surgery was performed to treat what zoo veterinarians believed was a persistent right aortic arch, a problem often found in dogs and cats. OSU veterinary surgeon Mark Rochat performed the surgery and has previously performed about a dozen similar surgeries on smaller animals such as dogs, cats and a cougar. He was assisted by other veterinary surgeons as well as the zoo's five-person veterinary team. This was the first attempt of this procedure on a giraffe, and without it Kyah would have had no chance of survival, Dr Cole said. At six months old and eight feet tall, Kyah (right) weight 525 pounds and played with the other giraffes in her enclosure . Kyah, described by zookeepers as feisty and mischievous, did not appear sick to visitors. At six months old she was nearly eight feet tall and weighed 525 pounds. She played with the other giraffes in her enclosure and picked the occasional fight with the geese that sometimes settle there. Keepers first noticed a problem when Kyah began regurgitating her mother's milk after nursing at was six weeks old. The problem got worse as she transitioned to solid food. A routine necropsy will be performed, as is standard protocol when animals at accredited zoos in the U.S. die. After, the giraffe's tissue will be used for research purpose .","Kyah had extra blood vessel wrapped round esophagus .

Peter Barr, from West Lothian, Scotland, broke the strict terms and conditions after marginally overshooting his space at a privately-run car park in Cornwall.

He said: 'When I returned to the car park I found a Parking Notice Charge which said I was not wholly within the parking bay. I agree I was about eight inches outside the bay on the passenger side - I hadn't noticed. 'But the car park was less than five per cent full so I wasn't inconveniencing anyone and as this was late afternoon the car park wasn't going to get any fuller. 'Now I have been stung with a £100 fine for my being the two hand-widths out of line. This is absurd.

"By . Leon Watson . Can't make a loved one's funeral? Don't worry, a cemetery is now offering the chance to watch services live on a 4G mobile phone. Kemnal Park Cemetery and Memorial Gardens, in Chislehurst, south-east London, claims it is the first in the country to offer the high speed video feed of funeral services directly from the graveside. Grieving families can request a cameraman records the proceedings, which are streamed live over the network used by new smartphones. Kemnal Park Cemetery and Memorial Gardens, in Chislehurst, south-east London has become the first in the country to offer a live 4G video feed of funeral services directly from the graveside . The package is aimed at friends and family who live abroad and are unable to travel, or those who are infirm and unable to leave their home. Users can watch and listen to the broadcast by logging on to a password-protected website on a computer, mobile phone, or tablet. The £450 charge includes a professional cameraman, equipment, and wireless 4G data charges. Families can also request a hard copy recording of proceedings for to watch later. Some cemeteries and crematoria already offer live streaming from within the chapel using fixed cameras and a wired broadband connection. But bosses at Kemnal Park say this is the first time families have been able to request a wireless, graveside recording with a roaming camera. It is available for burials and cremation services. Michael Burke, operations director at Kemnal Park, said: 'Our new 4G service is as close as you can get a funeral service without actually being there. A cameraman records the proceedings, which are streamed live over the high-speed 4G network used by new smartphones . Bosses at Kemnal Park say this is the first time families have been able to request a wireless, graveside recording with a roaming camera . 'We are taking advantage of the latest technology to beam high quality video and audio around the world in real-time. 'It is ideal for friends and family who are unable to travel to Kemnal Park but still wish to pay their respects.' He added: 'People use their mobile phones to record everything they see these days, but they draw a line at funeral services, because they see it as morbid. Kemnal Park covers an area of 55 acres, has 30,000 grave spaces, and a chapel that houses up to 500 mourners . 'However, they do realise it may be nice to relive memorable moments at a later date, perhaps if a young relative sings, or somebody delivers a particularly poignant eulogy. 'We are now able to film that for them, and have had a lot of demand from people who do want a recording but do not want to do it themselves. Our new 4G streaming service takes things a little bit further. 'We now foresee the time when celebrities will welcome their fans watching their service remotely, away from immediate family and friends.' Funeral director Michael Killick, from J and R Killick, in West Wickham, south-east London, described the service as an 'excellent extra'. Mr Killick, who conducted the first streamed service, said: 'There are times when it can be impractical for some family members to attend a funeral at short notice. That may be because of distance or their own health. 'But just about everywhere now has access to the internet, so we see this 'virtual service' as an excellent extra option to be able to offer a family.' He added: 'I found it very moving that the grandson and his wife who reside in New Zealand were able to watch this service at 3am their time and still be part of the service at Kemnal Park.'

"By . Laura Clark, Education Correspondent . Schools are resorting to having kitchen ‘pods’ dropped in by crane as the fiasco surrounding Nick Clegg’s free meals pledge deepens. More than 1,700 primaries have no cooking facilities, it emerged – as research revealed just how ill-equipped they are to meet the promise to four to seven-year-olds from September. Some plan to hire or buy self-contained mini-kitchenettes which can be lowered into the playground, as they have no permanent kitchen. KitchenPods, fully self-contained kitchens that can be delivered to schools and can be up and running within a matter of hours . Others will be forced to provide cold packed lunches to be eaten at classroom desks. Figures compiled by the BBC found that 1,749 schools have no kitchen at all. Many more need improvements to their kitchens before they can deliver the promise. The research emerged as a former adviser to Education Secretary Michael Gove said that the Liberal Democrats gave his department ‘just a few hours’ notice of the £1billion policy. Henry de Zoete said the sudden announcement at last year’s Lib Dem conference meant the ‘hard graft’ needed to develop the details of the policy could not be done. This had led to problems with implementation and ‘changes in position’, he said. The developments came as headteachers questioned the ‘ethics’ of handing free meals to well-off children rather than targeting those who are judged most in need. Leading children's food expert and No.1 parenting author, Annabel Karmel MBE, has given traditional school food a radical overhaul, with new child-approved  menus for schools that will be launched this coming September . Ministers have launched a range of initiatives aimed at helping schools meet the September deadline to deliver  the policy. These include setting up a ‘small schools taskforce’ – a coalition of caterers, kitchen designers and others – to assist those with less than 150 pupils. It is preparing to launch a pilot next term, which will involve providing up to 30 schools with kitchen pods – small kitchenettes that can handle up to 80 meals. They cost between £26,000 and £38,000 to buy or about £10,000 a year to hire. Schools can order bespoke pods based on their pupil numbers and existing equipment. Annabel Karmel, the chef and author, has designed a range of menus that can be easily prepared in the pods, including familiar dishes such as spaghetti bolognese. Under Deputy Prime Minister Mr Clegg’s policy, schools will be required by law to provide a nutritious meal – whether it is hot or cold. One headteacher yesterday  told how he could not afford the staff needed to supervise pupils at lunchtime. Despite a call, and subsequent promise for free school meals, more than 1,700 primary schools have no cooking facilities and are too ill-equipped to meet the pledge . Duncan Churchill, of Mudeford Infants in Dorset, told the BBC’s Daily Politics show: ‘We are talking about children as young as four walking round with trays of food. They need supervision and that costs money.’ Mr Churchill said the free packed lunches already delivered to eligible pupils by outside caterers were ‘the sort of stuff you get on a train, where it’s been left to sweat’. He questioned whether spending tens of thousands on giving free meals to pupils in ‘leafy Dorset’ was the best use of  the funds. Pete Mountstephen, chairman of the National Primary Heads group, raised ‘ethical issues’ with the policy. Mr Mountstephen, who is also head of St Stephen’s CofE Primary in Bath, said some families could easily afford to spend £400 a year on packed lunches, cash that could be better spent on those in real need. A spokesman for the Department for Education said: ‘Schools are receiving a huge amount of support to provide free school meals. ‘We are providing £150million to improve kitchens and dining facilities, as well as £22.5million specifically to help smaller schools to provide these meals.’","Despite free meals by September pledge, 1,749 schools have no kitchen .

"By . Leon Watson . It's seen as the Holy Grail of comedy, but Michael Palin has admitted most of Monty Python was 'c***'. The comedian, broadcaster and travel writer claimed fans only remember the best bits of the legendary Python troupe's much-loved show and ignore the 'dross'. Palin, while announcing his first solo tour of Britain, said his career had been sprinkled with 'lowlights and cock-ups'. Scroll down for video . Back together: (Left to right) Actors Michael Palin, John Cleese, Terry Jones, Terry Gilliam and Eric Idle . But he did say he had been lucky to have a selection of 'gleaming' sketches that people remember fondly, such as the Dead Parrot and the Spanish Inquisition. The Pythons - John Cleese, Terry . Gilliam, Terry Jones, Eric Idle and Michael Palin - revealed in November . they will launch a comeback this year. Despite . all being in their seventies with a combined age of 357 years, the . group are getting back on stage together for the first time in 30 years at the O2 in July. The Pythons had originally announced a one-off show at the O2 Arena but . tickets to that sold out in 43.5 seconds. A further nine dates were then . added, all of which have sold out. Palin said at the London Book Fair he will follow it up with a one-man tour in the . autumn, based on the soon-to-be published third volume of his diary, covering the years 1988 to 1998. The . 21-venue tour, entitled Travelling to Work, will see Palin speak about . his career, with anecdotes, photographs and footage 'looking back at 25 . years of exploring the world and nearly 50 years in radio, television, . books and films'. Cult comedy: The group's surreal TV series Monty Python's Flying Circus was first broadcast in 1969 . Getting back together: The five remaining stars of Monty Python (from left: Eric Idle, Terry Jones, John Cleese, Michael Palin, Terry Gilliam, and Graham Chapman who died in 1989) are to reunite for a show . He told the Daily Telegraph: 'People forgive you the things that don’t work. A lot of Python was c***, it really was. We put stuff in there that was not really that good, but fortunately there were a couple of gleaming things that everyone remembers while they’ve forgotten the dross. 'I'm very proud of the things I've done,' he said. 'There are a lot of things looking back which you would say . were brilliant, but it’s also about what's behind it and feeling of how . you recover from things that didn't work so well.' Palin said he will share anecdotes about the lesser-known parts of his career. He will include his work on the 1994 West End play that 'got a right panning from critics' and the 1992 series Palin’s Column, in which he 'pottered around' the Isle of Wight before writing up his exploits for the local paper. The Pythons' hugely successful, zany BBC TV series, Monty Python's Flying Circus, effectively threw away the rulebook of traditional sketch writing, dispensing with punchlines and allowing sketches to blend into each other or simply stop abruptly. The first episode of Monty Python's Flying Circus was broadcast on 5 October, 1969. It ran for four series and spawned spin-off records, books and even German-language specials. Gilliam's unique animation style became a key element of the show, segueing seamlessly between any two completely unrelated ideas. The comedy group made their successful film Monty Python and the Holy Grail on a small budget in between filming the third and fourth series of their TV show. Their next film was the highly controversial Monty Python's Life Of Brian, released in 1979. Telling the story of a man mistaken for Jesus, the film was attacked by Christian groups and banned in some areas. Monty Python's The Meaning Of Life was released in 1983 and was another financial and critical success, winning the jury prize at Cannes film festival. Palin's tour will begin on September 7 and run until October 22, with tickets on sale now. John Cleese from the classic Monty Python sketch The Ministry of Funny/Silly Walks' 1. The Dead Parrot . Inspired by Michael Palin's trip to a mechanic who refused to accept there was a problem with his car, this is arguably the most famous Monty Python sketch. Praline: It's not pining, it's passed on. This parrot is no more. It has ceased to be. It's expired and gone to meet its maker. This is a late parrot. It's a stiff. Bereft of life, it rests in peace. If you hadn't nailed it to the perch, it would be pushing up daisies. It's rung down the curtain and joined the choir invisible. This is an ex-parrot. 2. The Killer Joke . The sketch about a joke so funny, the man who wrote it laughs himself to death. Inspector: I shall enter the house and attempt to remove the joke ... I shall be aided by the sound of sombre music, played on gramophone records, and also by the chanting of laments by the men of Q Division ... The atmosphere thus created should protect me in the eventuality of me reading the joke. 3. The Lumberjack Song . The catchy song by a cross-dressing woodcutter. Barber: ‘I cut down trees, I skip and jump/ I like to press wild flowers/I put on women’s clothing/ And hang around in bars’ 4. Hell's Grannies . A town is terrorised by gangs of marauding old ladies. Policeman: We have a lot of trouble with these oldies. Pension day's the worst – they go mad. As soon as they get their hands on their money they blow it all on milk, bread, tea, tin of meat for the cat. 5. The Piranha Brothers . Current affairs programme 'Ethel the Frog' presents the story of ‘the notorious Piranha Brothers, who were clearly based on the Kray Twins. Interviewer: I've been told Dinsdale Piranha nailed your head to the floor. Stig: No. Never. He was a smashing bloke. He used to buy his mother flowers and that. He was like a brother to me. Interviewer: But the police have film of Dinsdale actually nailing your head to the floor. Stig:(pause) Oh yeah, he did that. Interviewer: Why? Stig: Well he had to, didn't he? I mean there was nothing else he could do, to be fair. I had transgressed the unwritten law.","Palin admits most of Monty Python's sketches were 'c***'

"By . Taylor Auerbach . The superbug which has forced Australian swimming legend Ian Thorpe into 'around-the-clock' hospital care was picked up in a Sydney hospital, MailOnline can confirm. Contrary to initial reports that Thorpe, 31, was infected following a shoulder operation in Switzerland, his manager Will Erskine confirmed the bug was picked up in February following surgery in Sydney. He described as 'incorrect' reports that Thorpe picked up the debilitating infection after surgery near his home in Ronco sopra Ascona. Rocky water: Ian Thorpe (pictured at the January wedding of Tristan MacManus and Tahyna Tozzi) in 24-hour medical care after picking up a superbug in Sydney . 'He was operated on in Sydney at the end of January and it was no good the first time,' Mr Erskine said. 'He had to have a couple of repeats...the surgery was done in Sydney subsequently in late February, that's when he picked it up.' Mr Erskine said the five-time Olympic gold-medalist hasn't been to Switzerland since 'mid to late last year'. There are rumours circulating that Thorpe's initial shoulder surgery was carried out by a prominent sports physician based in the western Sydney suburb of Bankstown, something his manager would not confirm or deny. 'I can confirm (the infection) is not golden staph, which raises alarm bells for everyone,' said Mr Erskine. 'They're bugs you can pick up when you go into hospital...He's receiving around-the-clock care. 'Is there a possibility that he'll lose mobility in his arm or that they will potentially have to amputate? It's a minuscule possibility.' Happier times: Ian Thorpe (winning gold in the 200m freestyle at the Athens 2004 Olympic Games) will never swim competitively again . Super athlete: There is a 'miniscule' chance Thorpe's arm will be amputated . Mr Erskine estimated the chances that doctors would have to perform such a drastic operation to be less than one per cent. He would not reveal the specific bug that Thorpe is battling, aided by 'continuous' antibiotic drips. He also said his client was not in intensive care. 'He's in good spirits,' he said. Earlier, Will's father James Erskine - who also manages Ian Thorpe - told Channel 9's Today the Olympic legend looked like the 'bionic man' but rubbished suggestions he could lose movement in his left arm. 'If you saw him he’s in good spirits, he’s got drips and antibiotics, drains all that kind of thing so he’s not exactly going to swim in the Commonwealth Games tomorrow,' Erskine told Today. 'I saw him yesterday he’s not in intensive care, he’s a sick boy, he’s not going to get out, roam around and have cups of coffee or meet Prince William in the next day. Battling demons: It was around this time (the 2002 Manchester Commonwealth Games) that Thorpe started experiencing depression . 'He’s fighting it, he’s got an infection. He’s battling, he’s unlucky and how long it’s going to take to clear up I don’t know. 'There have  been some very serious consequences of these infections and he’s aware of that and that’s why he’s getting the best treatment.' Thorpe revealed in his 2013 autobiography This Is Me he has been battling 'crippling' depression since just after the 2000 Sydney Olympics. In early February, shortly after Thorpe's first ill-fated shoulder operation, he was found in a 'dazed and disoriented state' by police in Panania - another western Sydney suburb. He was admitted into rehab days later. Frustrated: Ian Thorpe's management say he has virtually been in a hospital bed since January .","Thorpe went back to hospital after initial shoulder operation was botched .

"By . Becky Barrow, Business Correspondent . Experts have branded plans to give the taxman the power to raid individuals’ bank accounts without their permission ‘extremely worrying’, ‘excessive’ and potentially illegal. The ‘unprecedented’ access – revealed in the Budget statement – could result in money being taken from innocent families, MPs were told yesterday. The powers were outlined as part of measures to clamp down on tax avoidance. They would allow HM Revenue & Customs to seize unlimited amounts of money directly from the bank accounts of anyone they believe owes more than £1,000 in tax. HMRC claims the new rules would be used to target ruthless tax dodgers. Plans to give the taxman the power to raid individuals' bank accounts without their permission are potentially illegal according to experts. The 'unprecedented access' - revealed in the Budget statement - could result in money being taken from innocent families, MPs have been warned . But Frank Haskew, head of the tax faculty at the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, told MPs it is ‘a fundamental tenet of our English law and our democratic society’ that money ‘cannot be grabbed from somebody’s account without a judge agreeing to the move’. He said the change, which could come into force in just 12 months’ time, would be ‘unprecedented in the UK’. He added: ‘At the end of the day, we can’t have HMRC as judge and jury on this.’ Mr Haskew said the tax authority had a long track record of making mistakes and harassing innocent taxpayers – and that it could end up targeting the wrong people. In his written evidence to MPs, Mr Haskew said the current proposal is ‘of considerable concern to many taxpayers and accountants’. ‘These powers are extremely worrying and excessive,’ he added. Patrick Stevens, tax policy director at the Chartered Institute of Taxation, said he feared vulnerable people could be wrongly charged. He told MPs: ‘The concern that we certainly have is that however many safeguards there are on the ability to simply take money from somebody’s bank account, it does rely on the authority having worked out how much money should correctly be taken from it in the first place. ‘It may mean over a period of time particularly more vulnerable people – people who are not wealthy, high earners – may become subject to this.’ The experts’ comments have added to a growing chorus of concern over the controversial move. Britain is being robbed of around £35billion a year by cheats who fail to pay their taxes and others who find ways of avoiding them, according to HMRC. The powers were outlined as part of measures to clamp down on tax avoidance and would allow HM Revenue & Customs (pictured) to seize unlimited amounts of money directly from the bank accounts of anyone they believes owes more than £1,000 in tax . Under the proposals, which will be subject to a consultation, HMRC will be able to take all the money that a person owes in tax out of their bank account, subject to two key rules. It cannot take the full amount unless the person would have at least £5,000 left across all bank accounts after the tax debt has been paid and the money can only be taken if HMRC has contacted the person at least three times about the unpaid tax bill. HMRC estimates around 17,000 people a year will be hit by the new rules and each of them will typically owe around £5,800. But Andrew Tyrie MP, who chairs the Commons Treasury Committee, has previously said members of the committee were ‘concerned’ about the move. Liberal Democrat MP John Thurso, who sits on the committee, has said: ‘The victims will be people with just enough money to go after but not enough to hire lawyers to fend it off.’ He said any such ‘advance of powers by the state’ should be ‘resisted unless they can justify it’. Mr  Stevens has previously said: ‘There are lots of very unsophisticated people out there with more than £5,000 in a bank account. We are truly worried about the vulnerable.’ Mr Haskew said the new law could trigger ‘perverse effects’, such as people keeping their money in cash, rather than in a bank account, so HMRC cannot get its hands on the money. In the Budget documents, the Treasury insists HMRC’s new debt collection powers ‘bring the UK in line with many other tax authorities which already have the power to recover debts directly from an individual’s account, such as France and America’. An HMRC spokesman said: ‘Most people pay their taxes on time, but a minority do not, and some refuse to engage with us at all. ‘It is wrong that this should hand an advantage to those who simply dodge their obligations and is unfair on the vast majority who pay their taxes in full and on time. ‘We will shortly be consulting on a new measure with appropriate safeguards to help level the playing field, and tackle those who have the means to pay but are choosing not to. ‘This will only affect a tiny number of debtors.’ Overall, HMRC estimates around half of the people who it will be targeting have more than £20,000 in their bank accounts, but are still refusing to pay their tax bill.","Plans could result in money being taken from innocent families say experts .

"By . Associated Press . and Damien Gayle . Dynasty: Ted Kennedy Jr announces his candidacy to run for Connecticut State Senate at Blackstone Memorial Library in Branford, Connecticut . Ted Kennedy Jr has finally given into the pressure to join the family business by agreeing to make a bid for political office. The . son of the well-respected late U.S. senator from Massachusetts will . stand for election to the Connecticut state senate, after a long legal . career. Hundreds turned out . yesterday for his official announcement at a carefully choreographed . rally in his home town of Branford, where his comments drew standing . ovations from the crowd. 'I'm proud of my . family's legacy of standing up for working families, for political, . social and economic justice,' the 52-year-old said. He . claimed to share the same consensus building philosophy as his late . father, who died in 2009 and was widely regarded as the U.S. Senate's . most prominent liberals. 'We . need people in government, both Democrat and Republican, who are able . to build bridges and find common ground,' he said while joined on stage . by his wife and two children. Mr . Kennedy, whose voice boomed like his father's at times, revealed that . his father was among those who had encouraged him to run for office over . the years. But he said he wanted to raise his family and develop his own expertise on the issues before running. 'I . have been a fighter for children and families that have been impacted . by environmental contamination and lead poisoning,' he was quoted as . saying by ctpost.com. As . well as his work as a lawyer specialising in health issues, Mr Kennedy . serves on the board of the American Association of People with . Disabilities. He said a life of advocacy grew from the loss of his leg to cancer as a child. He . told the audience at the Blackstone Library of the . horror that he felt when he learned as a 12-year-old that doctors would . have to amputate the limb. He thought his life was over, he said, but the experience had eventually helped him appreciate the needs of others. When . he met another boy who lost his leg and learned he couldn't afford an . artificial one, he said he resolved to do something with his life and . make sure others did not have to experience such hardship. Family man: Mr Kennedy was joined by his wife and two children as he made his announcement yesterday . Experience: His decision to stand for office comes after a long career as a lawyer and disability campaigner . Heir apparent: Retiring senator Ed Meyer presented Mr Kennedy at the rally at the Blackstone Library . Patrick . Kennedy, who represented Rhode Island in Congress for 16 years until he . retired in 2011, said on Monday that his brother's life was transformed . when he lost his leg. Borrowing . a phrase from their illustrious uncle, President John F. Kennedy, he . said his brother became a 'profile in courage' by surviving and becoming . a champion for people with disabilities. The . younger Kennedy is making a bid for the Democratic nomination for the . 12th Senatorial District representing towns near New Haven, which since . 2002 has been represented by Democrat Edward Meyer. Mr Meyer, 79, who is to retire at the next election, introduced Mr Kennedy at the rally as his heir apparent. It's . a far lower profile seat than the U.S. Senate, where Mr Kennedy's name . has been mentioned as a possible candidate, but the lawyer says he . believes he can make an impact at state level. Modest: Mr Kennedy's name has been touted as a candidate for the U.S. Senate, and he said his father too had tried to persuade him to run, but the lawyer said he believes he can make a difference at the state level . There are no other declared candidates in the race, but Republicans have vowed to vigorously contest the seat. State Republican Party Chairman Jerry Labriola Jr. said his party has several quality candidates interested in running. He told ctpost.com: 'Sen. Meyer has been increasingly out of touch in a district which has been trending Republican. 'I . can't imagine that the voters would now want to move further to the . left of Sen. Meyer. This candidacy represents the same liberal orthodoxy . employed by (Gov.) Dan Malloy, which is driving people out of our state . and wrecking our economy.' Campaign mode: Mr Kennedy Jr  speaks to supporters and the media after declaring his candidacy . Finally! Gina MacDonald-Page poses with Mr Kennedy, whose candidacy for the Connecticut senate seat comes after years of pressure to join in the family business . Darrell .

'Even . if your last name is Kennedy you have to establish yourself,' said . West, vice president of governance studies at the Brookings Institution.

"By . Neil Michael . At the British parliament yesterday, President Michael D. Higgins hailed the transformation of relations between Britain and Ireland, from a period of doubt to trust and mutual respect. In his address to the Houses of Parliament – the first time Ireland's head of state has been given the honour of speaking there – Mr Higgins said the two countries now had a closeness that once seemed unachievable. While he praised the parliamentarians gathered, he himself was hailed a 'renaissance man for a renaissance era in UK-Irish politics' by Lord Speaker Baroness D'Souza. The President said Britain and Ireland must take pride in the peace that had been built in the North. 'I am conscious that I am in the company here of many distinguished parliamentarians who have made their own individual contributions to the journey we have travelled together,' he said. Oration: Irish President Michael D. Higgins stands at the lectern to deliver his speech as a guest at the Houses of Parliament in London . In a wide-ranging speech, which concluded with a 51-second standing ovation, President Higgins touched on many of the themes which his four-day official state visit to Britain will explore . 'I acknowledge them and I salute them, as I acknowledge and salute all those who have selflessly worked to build concord between our peoples. I celebrate our warm friendship and I look forward with confidence to a future in which that friendship can grow even more resolute and more productive.' In a wide-ranging speech, which concluded with a 51-second standing ovation, President Higgins touched on many of the themes which his four-day official state visit to Britain will explore, including emigration and shared history. The President addressed peers and MPs in the parliament's royal gallery, flanked by floral displays in green, white and orange. British Prime Minister David Cameron, his deputy Nick Clegg and Labour leader Ed Miliband were in the audience. Also among the MPs watching the address were Sinn Féin's Pat Doherty, Michelle Gildernew and Paul Maskey, who do not take their seats in the Commons. Mutual respect: President Higgins, left, shakes hands with John Bercow, right, the Speaker of the House of Commons . President Higgins paid tribute to the UK parliament for being synonymous with the principle of democracy and used his address to urge politicians to look at the foundation of parliamentary democracy in Britain for inspiration, referencing the Magna Carta and its significance for modern nations. He said politics, society and the economy cause division between the citizen and the state when they are treated as separate entities and he urged politicians to remember that citizenship should be rooted in the principles of active participation, justice and freedom. 'Such a vision of citizenship is shared by our two peoples,' Mr Higgins said. 'It is here, in this historic building, that, over the centuries, the will of the British people gradually found its full democratic voice. 'It is inspiring to stand in a place where, for more than a century, many hundreds of dedicated parliamentarians, in their different ways, represented the interests and aspirations of the Irish people.' Britain's Prime Minister David Cameron, right, accompanied by Labour party leader Ed Miliband, left, and Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, centre, laugh as they wait for the arrival of the Irish President . The President – a Labour politician for several decades before he was elected head of state in 2011 – acknowledged that the fight for Irish independence, which his father took part in, cast a long shadow over Anglo-Irish relations but also noted how ties across the Irish Sea are now stronger than ever. 'We acknowledge that past but, even more, we wholeheartedly welcome the considerable achievement of today's reality - the mutual respect, friendship and co-operation which exists between our two countries,' he said. 'That benign reality was brought into sharp relief by the historic visit of Queen Elizabeth to Ireland three years ago. 'Her Majesty's visit eloquently expressed how far we have come in understanding and respecting our differences, and it demonstrated that we could now look at each other through trusting eyes of mutual respect and shared commitments. 'The ties between us are now strong and resolute. Formidable flows of trade and investment across the Irish Sea confer mutual benefit on our two countries. Britain's Queen Elizabeth and Michael D Higgins  look at a fan as they view Irish-related items from the Royal Collection in the Green Drawing Room in Windsor Castle . 'In tourism, sport and culture, our people-to-people connections have never been as close or abundant.' Mr Higgins also recalled the hallowed figures of Irish nationalism, from the 18th-century emancipator Daniel O'Connell MP, to Irish freedom fighter and abstentionist Constance Markiewicz – the first woman elected to Westminster in 1918. He said O'Connell's ideals helped to guide and influence the achievement of the Good Friday Agreement of 1998. 'That achievement was founded on the cornerstones of equality, justice and democratic partnership, and was a key milestone on the road to today's warm, deep and enduring Irish-British friendship,' he said. Mr Higgins delivers his speech under a portrait of King George VI . 'Our two countries can take immense pride in the progress of the cause of peace in Northern Ireland. There is, of course, still a road to be travelled – the road of a lasting and creative reconciliation, and our two governments have a shared responsibility to encourage and support those who need to complete the journey of making peace permanent and constructive.' With Britain and Ireland celebrating a series of centenaries over the next few years, the countries' shared history is a key part of the themes around the state visit. Mr Higgins recalled the words of Irish nationalist MP Tom Kettle, who fought along with 200,000 Irishmen in the First World War, 50,000 of whom died, and who wrote that 'this tragedy of Europe may be and must be the prologue to the two reconciliations of which all statesmen have dreamed, the reconciliation of Protestant Ulster with Ireland, and the reconciliation of Ireland with Great Britain . Kettle later wrote of his hope for relations between Britain and Ireland, declaring: 'Free, we are free to be your friend.' Mr Higgins said: 'The journey of our shared British- Irish relationship towards that freedom has progressed from the doubting eyes of estrangement to the trusting eyes of partnership and, in recent years, to the welcoming eyes of friendship.' He also paid tribute to the Irish emigrant community in Britain. 'That community is the living heart in the evolving British-Irish relationship. 'I greatly cherish how the Irish in Britain have preserved and nurtured their culture and heritage while at the same time making a distinctive and valued contribution to the development of modern Britain,' he said. Commons Speaker John Bercow said the President's address at Westminster was historic. Commenting on the celebrations, Taoiseach Enda Kenny said: 'When I saw the queen of England outside Áras an Uachtaráin, with an Irish Army captain escorting her to do the honour, it made the hairs on the back of my neck stand. 'On the corner here this evening of Windsor village, to see the Tricolour on every pole, alongside the Union Jack, it does demonstrate the symbolism of just how far we have come.'","President Michael D.

"By . Steve Doughty . Tory rebel David Davis has said the Chancellor should commit should institute a higher tax-free transfers for married people . George Osborne should promise large-scale and  costly new tax breaks for married couples, a senior Tory said yesterday. The Chancellor should commit to a transferable tax allowance for married people worth the whole of their £10,500 income tax-free allowance, former Party chairman David Davis said. This would give vital support to marriage and the family and bring help to stay at home mothers. Next year ‘the Chancellor must use his final Budget of this Parliament to rebalance the tax system and remove the bias against families’, he said. ‘The importance of marriage and family to our children’s well-being needs to be recognised,’ he added. The call by Mr Davis – beaten by Mr Cameron in the 2005 Tory leadership election – is his second challenge in a week. It follows his demand that the Prime Minister open talks with Brussels on Britain’s exit from the EU. Tax support for married families and full-time mothers has been a regular theme on the Tory right and some MPs are unhappy Mr Cameron has done no more than offer a transferable tax allowance worth less than £200 to some married couples. Under that tax break, which will apply from April next year and help only basic-rate taxpayers, couples will be able to transfer £1,000 of their tax-free allowance to their partner. Mr Davis’s more sweeping proposal would apply to all married people, including those earning over the higher-rate tax threshold of £41,865. It would mean a husband whose wife was looking after children and transferred her tax allowance to him would be able to earn £21,000 before having to pay any income tax at all. Mr Davis said that in 1990, when the system was changed to tax people as individuals rather than as families, the intention had been that those who did not use their tax-free allowance should be able to transfer it to their spouse. But the transferable allowance had never been introduced. Davis says that the Chancellor should use his final budget next year to rebalance tax systems and stop bias on married couples in the tax system . Since then the threshold for paying tax has risen for single people with no responsibilities but hardly changed for families, Mr Davis said. Writing on the Conservative Woman website, he added: ‘The bias against single-earner families is particularly severe.’ Despite evidence marriage underpins more stable families the Government offers them no support, he said. In some cases a family can grow its income from £12,000 a year to £20,000, but have little more money to spend. ‘This produces a disincentive to aspiration,’ Mr Davis said. ‘The Conservatives should pledge to increase the transferable amount until the entire tax-free allowance, raised to £10,500 in the last Budget, is transferable, as should have happened when the taxation system was changed almost a quarter of a century ago.’ He said this would be expensive but should become a long-term aim. ‘When the personal allowance is fully transferable the state will be truly neutral on family decisions about whether parents go out to work,’ he said.","David Davis says that tax breaks should be larger for married couples .

"By . Snejana Farberov . An Arizona jury panel returned a guilty verdict this afternoon convicting Marissa Devault of bludgeoning her husband with a hammer in 2009. It took the jury of seven women and five men six days of deliberations to agree on the guilty verdict in the savage attack on Dale Harrell. Devault . told investigators that Harrell, 34, had physically and sexually abused . her in the past, and that she killed him in self-defense. Her fate is sealed: Marissa Devault was convicted of first-degree murder Tuesday in the 2009 killing of her husband following six days of deliberations . Doppelgangers: Devault (right) has been compared to 33-year-old Jodi Arias (left), who was found guilty of murdering her boyfriend last year - and whom Devault befriended in jail . Prosecutors, however, contended the . January 2009 attack on a sleeping Mr Harrell was premeditated and . motivated by her desire to obtain an insurance settlement so she could . pay back her boyfriend the $300,000 she had borrowed. They . said the 36-year-old Devault has given conflicting accounts of her . husband's death and that people who the woman claimed had witnessed some . of the past abuse didn't back up her claims. Harrell died at a hospice nearly a month after the attack of complications from his head injuries. The . case went to the Maricopa County Superior Court jury Monday, two months . after the start of the trial. Dale Harrell, 34: He suffered multiple skull fractures at the couple's home in the Phoenix suburb of Gilbert and died at a hospice nearly a month after the attack of complications from his head injuries . The same jurors who convicted Mrs . Devault now will decide whether to sentence her to life in prison or the . death penalty. The penalty phase is scheduled to begin Wednesday . morning. Devault sat in the Phoenix courtroom expressionless as she listened to the verdict. Devault's . case has been compared to the trial of Jodi Arias, who was found . guilty of first-degree murder last May for slashing, stabbing and . shooting to death Travis Alexander in his Mesa, Arizona, home in June . 2008. But the judge in the case made extensive efforts to keep the Devault trial from becoming a sideshow like the one that enveloped the Arias case in the same courthouse exactly one year ago. He warned the attorneys involved that he did not want any Arias trial fanatics on the jury, and he tried to keep certain sensational elements out of the trial. Devault's past as a stripper, for instance, was barely mentioned during the trial. The case attracted nowhere near the attention of the Arias trial despite some similar circumstances. Like in the Harrell murder, Arias claimed self-defense, accusing her longtime on-again, off-again lover of being abusive, ABC News reported. And . the similarities between the two women do not end there: the cases were . tried in the same Maricopa County courtroom, and both Arias and Devault . could face the death penalty. With their long dark hair and eyeglasses, the two women even look strangely alike. It . has been reported that the 36-year-old Devault befriended the . 33-year-old convicted killer while the two were in jail together. In . an interrogation video recorded just hours after the bloody attack, . Devault could be seen chuckling as she recounts the events of the night, . raising her arm in a motion mimicking hammer blows. ‘I saw a hammer go into Darrell’s head,’ she says with a nervous smile. Prosecutor . Michelle Arino said at the start of the trail in February that Mrs . Devault needed quick money to get out of her deep financial hole. But . one of Devault's attorneys raised questions about the credibility of . his client's boyfriend, who was given an immunity agreement on child . pornography allegations in exchange for his testimony. Authorities said Devault fatally wounded Dale Harrell by bludgeoning him over the head with a hammer as he slept in their suburban Phoenix home in January 2009. Disturbing: Devault is seen smiling while demonstrating for investigators just hours after the attack how the hammer (right) entered her husband's skull . Key witness: Businessman Allen Flores, who was Devault's boyfriend, testified for the prosecution against the woman who owed him $300,000 . Harrell, 34, suffered multiple skull fractures and died a month after the attack. Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty against Devault. Alan Tavassoli, one of Devault's attorneys, said prosecutors are giving a pass to his client's boyfriend, businessman Allen Flores, even after he failed to report to police that Devault had allegedly claimed three days before the hammer attack that her husband had been killed in a tire-iron beating. At first, Devault told investigators that Harrell had attacked her while she was asleep and choked her until she was unconscious. She told police that when she came to, she saw another man who lived at their Gilbert home beating Harrell with a hammer. But authorities say blood spatter showed Harrell was alone in the bed at the time of the attack and that bloodstains on Devault's clothes were consistent with a person swinging an object repeatedly over her head. Marissa Suzanne Devault, 36: She claims killing Dale Harrell was an act of self-defense and told investigators that her husband had physically and sexually abused her in the past . Investigators say Devault later confessed, saying she attacked her sleeping husband in a rage after he had sexually assaulted her. Police said they discovered Devault had been dating another man, Flores, for more than two years. In a search of Flores' computer, police say they found a journal that appeared to be written from his perspective and indicated that he had given Devault about $7,000, which she used to hire a hit man, according to court records. The prosecution said Devault needed to repay a $294,000 loan from her boyfriend. Authorities said child pornography also was found on Flores' computer. County prosecutors granted Flores immunity on that allegation in exchange for his testimony in the murder case.","Marissa Suzanne Devault, 36, convicted of first-degree murder in 2009 beating death of Dale Harrell .

"By . Ian Drury . A Royal Navy warship was embroiled in a stand-off with a Spanish patrol boat after an illegal incursion into Gibraltar’s waters. HMS Sabre, a Gibraltar Squadron patrol vessel with Army and Navy troops aboard, challenged the Civil Guard’s Rio Cedena and two other state ships. The Spaniards deliberately entered British-controlled waters as part of an ongoing ‘campaign of harassment’ over the Rock, it was claimed. HMS Sabre (pictured) was deployed to challenge the Spanish Civil Guard's Rio Cedena, and two other state ships, that had encroached on British waters . The incident took place as the Foreign Office revealed Spain had made almost 600 illegal incursions in just 14 months - or ten times a week - as tensions mount. The provocation has prompted MPs to demand a Royal Navy frigate to be permanently based in Gibraltar to deter Spain from sabre-rattling. Only last week the Spanish ambassador to the UK was summoned by the Foreign Office after one of the country’s research vessels unlawfully entered British coastal waters off Gibraltar. The latest face-off, on Monday, came when three Spanish state vessels breached the 12-mile territorial limit. An eyewitness said: ‘It seems they entered for no good reason other than to continue harassing and illegally exerting their presence. ‘The Spanish vessels made deliberate manoeuvres to provoke a reaction. There was nothing to suggest they were going anywhere, except to create an incident.’ They were confronted by HMS Sabre, a Royal Gibraltar Patrol vessel and two Royal Navy ribbed inflatables. The number of incursions has risen from just 30 in 2011 to 496 last year. So far this year, there have been more than 80 unlawful incursions, including by Spanish police, naval and coastguard vessels. Earlier this year a Spanish warship had to be escorted off British territory by HMS Sabre after it entered the waters near Gibraltar. The boat allegedly used a fake name and call sign, and refused to leave by its own accord at it claimed it was in Spanish waters, local media said. MPs, including Alec Shelbrooke (pictured) have been saying that warships should be 'permanent residence' in the waters of Gibraltar . The vessel approached as UK Special Forces personnel from the Royal Navy’s Submarine Parachute Assistance Group were carrying out training jumps into the sea. Tory MP Alec Shelbrooke, a member of the All-Party Parliamentary Group for Gibraltar, said: ‘We are getting to the stage where we need to send warships down there as a permanent presence to protect British interests and our citizens. ‘If Spain keeps encroaching on our territory, then maybe our Navy should start encroaching on any Spanish ships that encroach into our waters.’ Britain was given Gibraltar in the 1713 Treaty of Utrecht, but Spain has said it will never renounce its claim to sovereignty. Spanish aggression over the Rock increased after the election of Mariano Rajoy as the country’s prime minister in 2011. But relations between Madrid and London over the Mediterranean territory have deteriorated drastically since the construction of an artificial reef by the Gibraltar government which Spain says has interfered with their fisherman. Madrid responded by imposing tighter border controls, leading to long delays at the frontier, as the row escalated. In November, a British diplomatic bag was opened and searched by Spanish Guardia Civil officers on the border with Gibraltar - an incident the Foreign Office described as a ‘serious infringement’ of international diplomatic protocols. Repeated incursions into Gibraltar’s waters by Spanish state vessels led to the Spanish ambassador in London being summoned to the Foreign Office for a series of dressing downs. In one outburst, the Gibraltar Chief Minister has warned that Spanish vessels entering British territory may come under fire as they are not identified as being from ‘a friendly nation’. Fabian Picardo warned that Spanish boats ‘may find themselves shot at’ if they continue to disregard Gibraltar’s marine borders.","Spaniards accused of campaign of 'harassment' over Gibraltar .

One of two New York City Police Department officers who were critically injured in an apartment building fire over the weekend allegedly started by a 'bored' teenager has been declared brain dead. Officer Dennis Guerra, 38, remained on life support Tuesday evening at Montefiore Medical Center in The Bronx, where sobbing family members and his fellow cops have been keeping vigil. Guerra's partner, 36-year-old Officer Rosa Rodriguez, remained in critical condition in Manhattan's Weill Cornell Medical Center, where she was placed in a hyperbaric chamber. Scroll down for video . Evil grin: Marcell Dockery, 16, flashed a smile for the cameras during his arrest for allegedly starting a fire in Coney Island Sunday that left two police officers clinging to life . Bored firebug: Dockery, 16, admitted to police he set a mattress on fire inside the building out of boredom . The two veteran officers were overcome by smoke when they took an elevator up to the 13th floor inside an 18-story apartment complex on Surf Avenue while responding to a report of a suspicious fire at around noon Sunday. On Monday, police arrested 16-year-old Marcell Dockery on charges of assault, arson and reckless endangerment. Authorities said he lives in the building and set fire to a mattress that had been discarded in a hallway. During his arrest, the suspected arsonist was seen flashing a smile for the awaiting news cameras while being led to a police cruiser. ‘We saw him smiling on TV, is this a joke? We are going through so much right now,’Guerra’s outraged mother, Miriam, told the New York Post. Suspicious fire: Firefighters located officers Dennis Guerra and Rosa Rodriguez unconscious and unresponsive on the floor of the hall of the 13th floor . The two veteran officers were overcome by smoke when they took an elevator up to the 13th floor inside an 18-story apartment complex on Surf Avenue . Guerra, a married father of four, is an eight-year veteran of the department. Rodriguez, who also has four children, has been on the force for four years. Dockery later revealed to detectives that boredom led him to light the mattress on fire. He was ordered held without bail. ‘I decided to take a lighter and light the top of the mattress because I was bored,’ he reportedly told police. The teen described how he attempted to put out the flames, and when that failed, how he started knocking on neighbors’ doors to alert them to the danger, NBC New York reported. A source told the tabloid that Dockery is a ‘firebug’ who has been bragging about his obsession with flames on his Facebook page. Dockery has a lengthy history with the NYPD. In 2010, he was arrested for arson. His sealed record also includes criminal mischief and marijuana possession charges. The teen also may have been responsible for other small fires inside the Surf Avenue housing complex. Police Commissioner William Bratton said firefighters who responded to the scene just after noon last Sunday found both officers 'unconscious and unresponsive' in the hallway on the 13th floor. Confession: The teen described how he attempted to put out the flames before he started knocking on neighbors' doors to alert them to the fire . Emergency: Rodriguez, 36, was taken to .

The mother of four was first stabilized at Lutheran Hospital and then transferred to Weill Cornell Medical Center in Manhattan. On Tuesday, a relative told the New York Daily News that she was doing 'much better' and is expected to recover. Guerra, 38, was taken to Coney Island Hospital and then airlifted to Jacobi Medical Center. Between them the two officers have eight children.

"By . Ted Thornhill . and Associated  Press Reporter . An elderly dementia patient in a nursing home was placed ‘in apprehension of offensive, physical harm’ by a stripper, a lawsuit has claimed. The family of 85-year-old Bernice Youngblood decided to sue her Long Island care home after one of the sons found a picture in her belongings of her placing dollar bills in the underwear of a stripper, who was bent over her. Several other residents at the East Neck Nursing Center in West Babylon were present in the room, with one appearing to be crying, according to the suit. Scroll down for video . Risky business: The son of Bernice Youngblood (seen putting money in a stripper's underwear) was shocked when he arrived at her nursing home in Long Island to find this picture from a September 2012 strip show . Terrible and ashamed: Mrs. Youngblood (pictured) attended a dual press conference Tuesday in front of the facility and she said she felt 'terrible' and 'ashamed' The family complained not only about the striptease show, but about the fact that Mrs Youngblood's money was supposed to be locked safely away. They held a press conference outside the home Tuesday, which the woman's son Franklin Youngblood attended. He said he immediately went to a nursing supervisor for an explanation after finding the photo. The lawsuit claims the nurse attempted to snatch the photo from him. The suit said: ‘Plaintiff Bernice Youngblood was placed in apprehension of imminent, offensive, physical harm, as she was confused and bewildered as to why a muscular, almost nude man, was approaching her and placing his body and limbs, over [her] and directing [her] to place her hands about and upon his body, including his genital area, without [her] consent.' It continued: ‘Hiring male strippers to perform for the defendant’s nursing-home patients was a serial occurrence. ‘Bernice Youngblood has lived 85 years as a traditional Baptist, hard-working, lady... And now she has been defiled.' The . show was put on 'all for the perverse pleasure and enjoyment of the . Defendant’s staff', it added, and 'has breached its... duty of care by . purchasing the services of male strippers and directing them to perform . various sexually related acts upon the facility's patients knowing that . its patients did not have the physical or mental capacity to consent to . such vile acts or defend themselves against such vile acts'. Outraged: The Youngblood family listen during the Tuesday press conference. Bernice's son Franklin Youngblood (center) says a nursing home employee tried snatching the photo when he first found it in January 2013 . Attorney John Ray, representing the Youngbloods points to the photograph with his cane during the news conference. Ray says the elderly woman's money was supposed to be under lock and key . Howard . Fensterman, an attorney representing the facility, said a 16-member . resident committee had requested the September 2012 performance and the . nursing home paid the $250 fee. Fensterman . said the facility's management reserves the right to reject a request . by the residents' committee, particularly if the activity were deemed . detrimental. 'But in this instance these are . adults who wanted to have this activity, they requested it, they voted . on it and the nursing home approved of it,' he said. The . claims and counter-claims came during a sequence of heated news . conferences outside the facility in West Babylon. Reporters and . cameramen jostled in a large scrum around Fensterman and Ray when they . briefly became embroiled in an argument after Ray presented his . counterpart with a copy of the lawsuit complaint. Fensterman said the girlfriend of one of Youngblood's sons had taken her to the stripper show, and not nursing home employees. Ray said Youngblood's son disputed . that claim and, in any case, that does not mean Bernice Youngblood was . not harmed by what she saw. Fensterman . also chided Ray for claiming that Bernice Youngblood was suffering from . dementia, while at the same time noting the woman signed a power of . attorney document claiming she was competent to sign it. 'Ms. Youngblood suffers from partial dementia,' Ray said. 'She has moments of partial lucidity.' She . attended the news conference in a wheelchair with some of her relatives . at her side, mumbled in a barely audible voice that she felt ""terrible"" and ""ashamed"" about what happened, but had no specific recollection of . the details of the incident. The . East Neck website says: ‘We will provide you or your loved one with an . unsurpassed level of care that will nurture body, mind, and spirit. 'We honor the individuality, dignity, privacy, and safety of each individual with whom we have the pleasure of working.' Counterpoint: Attorney Howard Fensterman, representing the East Neck Nursing and Rehabilitation Center, points to a newspaper article about the nursing home during a news conference.

"By . Joshua Gardner . and Ap . The flashy Chinese gangster implicated in a shocking corruption and arms dealing case along with a once-respected California lawmaker says he's the victim of entrapment by racist FBI agents. The attorney for Raymond 'Shrimp Boy' Chow told reporters Tuesday that his client is innocent and that slavering undercover agents who took him down are the ones who've broken the law. Chow's camp made the accusations just after the grinning gangster's arraignment in federal court Tuesday, where he pleaded not guilty to corruption and gun running charges along with disgraced state senator Leland Yee and 19 others. Shrimp saga: The drama of grinning gangster Raymond 'Shrimp Boy' Chow continued Tuesday as he and 20 other defendants including disgraced California state senator Leland Yee pleaded not guilty to shocking charges of gun trafficking, corruption and conspiracy . 'The government created the crime, the government financed the crime, and the government ensnared my client,' Shrimp Boy's attorney Tony Serra told reporters following the arraignment. Chow's colorful dress and nickname along with a reputation as a once ruthless Chinese mobster-turned-reformed motivational speaker have made him  the breakout star in a scandal full of shocking details, even with a . fellow defendant as distinguished and high-profile as Mr. Yee. Investigators say Chow is the 'dragonhead' of one of the most powerful Asian gangs in North America. Chow's gang is said to have lured Yee into its clutches through money and campaign contributions in exchange for legislative help, as Yee sought to build his campaign coffers to run for California secretary of state. Racism? A lawyer for the self-proclaimed 'reformed' gang leader says his client was the victim of entrapment fueled by 'unadulterated racism' from FBI agents bent on proving San Francisco's Chinatown is run by Chinese gangsters . Shocking: Also implicated in the widespread corruption sting is California state senator Leland Yee, who's accused of offering agents weapons from the Philippines and political favors in exchange for campaign contributions . Chow has admitted that as a gang leader, he ran prostitution rings, smuggled drugs and extorted thousands of dollars from business owners in the 1980s. But he's maintained since his last release from prison in 2003 that he's reformed. And now his attorney say's he's been implicated because of his past and because of his race. 'We will put the government rightfully on trial,' proclaimed Serra. Serra said the undercover FBI agents who worked to snare Chow tried to get him to open a restaurant 'like the Mafia does, to process cash and launder it. He refused.' Their reasoning? 'Unadulterated racism,' that Serra contends was aimed to prove 'Chinese gangsters control Chinatown.' Widespread: An FBI carries out boxes of evidence following a search of a Chinatown fraternal organization March 26, part of the shocking sting that left over 20 Chinatown players accused of a range of serious crimes from arms trafficking to selling illegal cigarettes . 'It's a bunch of baloney,' he said. Chow is charged with laundering over $2 million and selling illegal booze and cigarettes. He remained jailed Tuesday with no bond set. Meanwhile, San Francisco Democrat Leland Yee is accused of conspiring to connect an undercover FBI agent with a Philippine arms dealer in exchange for campaign contributions, and of trading political influence for cash. Yee, who is free on $500,000 bond, has been suspended from the Legislature. He and his wife, Maxine, signed over their San Francisco home on Tuesday as collateral for the bond. The Yees and the senator's attorney Jim Lassart declined to comment outside court. Reformed? Chow became a sort of poster boy in San Francisco for how to leave the gang life behind after his release from prison following a sentence for racketeering in 2003. Here, he poses with former mayor Gavin Newsom. He was also named as a success story by figures as prominent as Senator Dianne Feinstein .","'Shrimp Boy' Chow's lawyer says he's the victim of entrapment by FBI agents eager to prove Chinese gangster run San Francisco's Chinatown .

"By . Snejana Farberov . and David Mccormack . In limbo: Scott Wilson, 23, was killed in a Florida car crash four years ago, but his ashes have yet to be put to rest because his divorced parents are at odds over what to do with them . Scott Wilson, 23, was killed in a Florida car crash four years ago, but his ashes have yet to be put to rest because his divorced parents cannot agree on what to do with them. On Tuesday, Lilli and William Wilson faced off in the 4th District Court of Appeal in Palm Beach to present their arguments. Wilson, an engineering graduate, was killed February 12, 2010, when John Goodman, the millionaire founder of The Palm Beach International Polo Club, rammed his Bentley into the victim's Hyundai and sent it flying into a canal. A week later, a Catholic Mass was held at St Rita Catholic Church in Wellington, after which Wilson's body was cremated. In . court today, William Wilson's attorney argued that his son's ashes . should be treated as property owned by whoever has possession of them, . and can therefore be divided, according to Palm Beach Post. But . the lawyer representing Lili Wilson insisted that human remains cannot . be considered property. Therefore, the ashes cannot be split up between . the two feuding former spouses. William . Wilson wishes to lay his share of son's remains in a family cemetery . plot in Georgia. His devout mother, however, wants the ashes to remain . intact in Palm Beach County. Wilson's devout mother, Lili Wilson (left), wants the ashes to remain intact in Palm Beach County . At odds: Lili Wilson (right) and William Wilson (left) have been . fighting over their son's ashes since 2010, with the father wanting to . split the cremated remains and bury his share in a family plot in . Georgia . The two sides in the case, as well as the three-person judicial panel, are being forced to navigate a largely uncharted territory since there is no clear legal precedent they could rely on to reach a decision. Judge Melanie May expressed concerns in court that treating a person's cremated remains as property could be offensive to people's spiritual views. The attorney for Lili Wilson argued that Scott's ashes cannot be treated as property, and that the process of cremation had not stripped the young man of his personhood . Attorney Kristina Pett, who represents Lili Wilson, agreed. ‘A person is not a thing. A person cannot be owned,’ she argued. ‘Just because the parents decided to cremate Scott does not make him property. Scott’s a person.’ William Wilson's counsel, Joy Bartmon, countered by saying that in this day and age, people dispose of loved ones’ ashes in various ways, from scattering them at sea to wearing them in lockets. ‘The law is clear: we can’t do anything we want with a body, but we can do anything we want with ashes,’ she stated. The dispute over Scott Wilson's ashes is only one issue in which his parents have been at odds. The Wilsons, who split in 2007, have fought bitterly over the husband's baseball card collection and ownership of their home videos. It could take the appeals court weeks, or even months, to reach a decision on Scott Wilson’s creamted remains. Florida tycoon John Goodman was convicted of DUI manslaughter and vehicular homicide in May 2012 and sentenced to 16 years in prison and a fine of $10,000, but he was granted a retrial last year after a juror at his first trial was adjudged to have lied to get on the panel. Polo tycoon: John Goodman now faces a retrial after his defense team successfully argued that a juror had lied during the selection process . Goodman, right, attempted to adopt his 42-year-old girlfriend . Heather Hutchins in a move designed to preserve part of his fortune for her while negotiating a civil suit settlement . Goodman, the multimillionaire . founder of one of world's largest polo clubs, claimed in court that . his $200,000 Bentley malfunctioned and lurched forward, slamming into . Wilson's vehicle. He has also denied being drunk at the . time of the crash, although other testimony has contradicted him and . his blood alcohol level was more than twice the legal limit three hours . after the crash, according to prosecutors. Goodman fled the scene of the accident, authorities said. During his first trial, Judge Jeffrey Colbath condemned Goodman's actions, saying: 'He left to try and save himself.' Goodman reached a settlement with the Wilson family and will pay out $46million in compensation to them. Goodman also made headlines when he . adopted his girlfriend, Heather Hutchins, 42, in an attempt to preserve . part of his fortune for her while negotiating a civil suit settlement. Last March, a Miami appeals court reversed the ruling that allowed the . adoption. During the original trial the . judge said: 'These are horrible, horrible cases from a criminal justice . standpoint. Scott Wilson's death was senseless. He was on the eve of . fullness of life.' Goodman’s second trial was originally scheduled to begin in March, but it has been delayed indefinitely. Impact: The crumpled car driven by Wilson, left, and the Bentley driven by Goodman, right. Goodman said he drank from a bottle of liquor he found after the crash - the reason he was over the limit . Deadly: Wilson family members look at the Bentley Goodman was driving when he ran a stop sign in 2010 . Prosecutors successfully claimed that . Goodman was drunk when he rammed his black Bentley convertible into . Mr Wilson's car four years ago, causing it to roll into a canal, where the 23-year-old man drowned after being unable to free himself from his seat belt. The millionaire disputed the claims and argued in court that the crash was the result of a malfunction with his brakes. Goodman left the scene and waited an . hour to call 911 while Scott drowned. He gave a dead cell phone battery . as the reason why he walked away from the crash scene. After the crash, Goodman's blood alcohol level was measured at .177 per cent, more than twice the legal driving limit. At trial Goodman said he was sure of . one thing: he had two shots of tequila and two shots of vodka before the . crash, yet he was not drunk and that he drunk after the crash to . alleviate his pain. Lap of luxury: The International Polo Club, which Goodman founded, attracts A-list celebrities . After leaving a bar, he said his car . suddenly lurched forward into an intersection 'and I began to apply my . brakes, and the car did not seem to be stopping as easily as I was used . to,' he said. Unable to control the vehicle, it . slammed into the side of Scott's - even though Goodman said he was not . aware he had hit another driver so left the scene. If he had known someone had plunged into the canal, 'I would have done whatever I could have done to help', he claimed. Goodman then went to a nearby bar where he found a bottle of liquor, the Miami Herald reported.","Polo mogul John Goodman killed Scott Wilson, 23, in February 2010 .

"By . Rebecca Camber, Crime Reporter . The treasurer of the scandal-hit police union admitted yesterday that even he didn’t know how much money it had stashed away in its secret accounts. Just hours after the leaders of the embattled Police Federation quit, the shambolic state of the organisation’s finances were laid bare as treasurer Martyn Mordecai told MPs that he had spent years trying to find out how many millions were in the coffers, but rules prevented him from seeing the full figures. Mr Mordecai, who has been in the federation for almost two decades and held the £61,000 a year post of treasurer since 2009 despite having no financial qualifications, claimed that he faced ‘abuse’ by branch colleagues just for asking how much money they have in secret ‘off-shore’ reserves. (left to right) Sergeant Chris Jones, West Midlands Police Federation, Inspector Ken MacKaill, West Mercia Police Federation and  Detective Sergeant Stuart Hinton, Warwickshire Police Federation, answers questions in front of the Home Affairs Select Committee in the House of Commons on the internal inquiry following the meeting of the three police officers with former with former Cabinet minister Andrew Mitchell . A number of local branches are still refusing to publish their so-called ‘number two’ accounts, despite warnings from ministers that the union must open its books or face tough new laws forcing it to reform. It also emerged yesterday that the police federation spent 50 per cent more than previously thought on a controversial PR firm who advised using ‘guerrilla tactics’ against ministers just weeks before the Plebgate scandal. The body, which represents 127,000 rank and file officers, lavished £15,000-a-month on a media strategy calling for a military-style ‘blitzkrieg’ to halt government plans to reform pay and conditions for officers. A West Midlands branch of the organisation, which was at the centre of the ‘Plebgate’ storm, also paid out an extra £60,000 to the same public relations firm for anti-government posters, adverts on buses and bus shelters in Westminster and around the West Midlands during party conferences. The deal was agreed just weeks before the Plebgate incident in September 2012, involving then chief whip Andrew Mitchell who allegedly called policeman at the gates of Downing Street ‘***ing plebs’. Yesterday Mr Mordecai disclosed for the first time to a parliamentary committee that the federation has more than £21million in the bank and total assets of more than £107million. A further £4.5million is buried in ‘number two’ accounts, but three branches in North Yorkshire, Leicestershire and Derbyshire have refused to declare even to their national leaders how much money they have to the astonishment of MPs who said the organisation faced a ‘last chance saloon’. When chairman of the Home Affairs Select Committee, Keith Vaz asked why Mr Mordecai didn’t know about the reserves, he told him that the rules don’t currently allow the treasurer to see the figures, saying: ‘I have been trying to find out for a while, probably when I started off in 2009.’ The West Midlands branch of the organisation, which was at the centre of the ¿Plebgate¿ storm, then chief whip Andrew Mitchell who allegedly called policeman at the gates of Downing Street ¿***ing plebs¿ . He went on: ‘The funding system is archaic, it’s fundamentally wrong, that’s one of the reasons I want to stay.’ Mr Mordecai insisted that there was ‘nothing illegal’ in the secret accounts, exposing him to ridicule from MPs who pointed out that he doesn’t know how much is in the accounts and what they are used for. He told the committee that his health had suffered after being subjected to ‘abuse’ from colleagues who did not want to disclose the number two account details. Amid allegations of rampant spending on wining and dining on federation credit cards, Mr Mordecai confirmed that 30 board members had credit cards. Under questioning from MP Michael Ellis, he also revealed that two senior figures flew out to Italy to source ‘toilet pods’ for the Federation’s £26million luxury HQ in Leatherhead, Surrey. The revelations came just a day after two leading officials dramatically quit on Monday. Chairman Steve Williams and general secretary Ian Rennie resigned following a series of investigations by the Daily Mail. In January an independent review of the union by former Home Office mandarin Sir David Normington called for top-to-bottom reform and an end to a bullying culture. Yesterday he warned the organisation faced a ‘very dangerous moment’. He said the resignation of Mr Williams and Mr Rennie could pave the way for members who want to block much-needed reform to be elected as the new leadership. He said: ‘I do think they need to think hard about this because the danger is - this is a very dangerous moment for the Federation. It could be that the resignation of these two people will allow the people who want to block reform, it will allow them to be elected.’ Yesterday outgoing chairman Steve Williams said: ‘The Police Federation of England and Wales (PFEW) is currently in a necessary period of change. ‘Our purpose as a federation is to act as the representative body for our 127,000 members, the rank and file officers who bravely put their lives on the line every day to serve and protect the public. There is a huge amount of excellent work being done across the organisation to support these goals.’ ‘We will endeavour to engage and engender debate around the recommendations of the review as the decisions we make will provide a blueprint for considered, lasting change and guide the Federation into the future.’","Police Federation treasurer told MPs he had no idea how much they had .

"By . Kate Lyons . and Taylor Auerbach . and Candace Sutton . Ian Thorpe's manager has slammed reports the Australian swimming great risks losing the use of his left arm but confirmed he is battling a 'serious' infection in a Sydney hospital. James Erskine told Channel 9's Today the Olympic legend 'looks like the bionic man' after he contracted an infection post shoulder surgery in Switzerland. Grave fears are held for the Australian sporting icon, 31, after reports emerged the complication could lead to the loss of use in his left arm. Scroll down for video . Rocky water: Ian Thorpe (pictured at the January wedding of Tristan MacManus and Tahyna Tozzi) is battling a 'serious' infection in a Sydney hospital, his manager confirmed . Australian swimming hero: Five-time gold medalist Ian Thorpe is in an intensive care ward in Sydney, and close associates are gravely concerned for his welfare . 'If you saw him he’s in good spirits, he’s got drips and antibiotics, drains all that kind of thing so he’s not exactly going to swim in the Commonwealth Games tomorrow,' Erskine told Today. 'I saw him yesterday he’s not in intensive care, he’s a sick boy, he’s not going to get out, roam around and have cups of coffee or meet Prince William in the next day. 'He’s fighting it, he’s got an infection. He’s battling, he’s unlucky and how long it’s going to take to clear up I don’t know. 'There have  been some very serious consequences of these infections and he’s aware of that and that’s why he’s getting the best treatment.' Erskine said rumours of the gold medalist suffering paralysis in his left arm were 'poetic licence' and 'just nonsense'. Thorpe is receiving treatment after undergoing surgery at a hospital near his Swiss home of Ronco sopra Ascona. Surgery complications: A report in Sydney's media claims that the swimmer contracted a 'bug' after surgery that threatens the use of his left arm . A hospital-acquired infection usually first appears three days after admission to a hospital or other health care facility. The infection, which can be caused by viruses, bacteria, fungi or parasites, may develop from surgical procedures, catheters in the urinary tract or blood vessels or from material in the air which is inhaled into the lungs. These micro-organisms may already be present in the patient's body or come from the environment, contaminated hospital equipment, healthcare workers or other patients. Common hospital infections are MRSA and C Difficile. Sometimes the infection can have devastating results and require a limb to be amputated, if the infection cannot be treated. Some of the common causes of infections are when the hospital: Fails to carry out routine pre-screening for MRSA or C-Difficile prior to surgery; delays in identifying and treating the infection when it has been acquired; fails to treat or monitor the infection appropriately, to provide basic medical care and post-surgical treatment or a clean and safe environment. Thorpe was flown to Sydney, where he is in intensive care, and yesterday Network Seven reported that he could lose the use of his left arm. The troubled swimmer spent time in a rehab facility in February, where he was treated for depression and painkillers after he was found walking around a Sydney street dazed and disoriented. His management claimed Thorpe had been taking the painkillers due to a shoulder operation earlier in the year. Ian Thorpe contracted the latest infection after having shoulder surgery in Australia, Thorpe’s onetime coach, Gennadi Touretski told a Swiss news outlet. Touretski, who prepared the swimmer for his failed 2011 comeback, said he was confident Thorpe would recover from the shoulder infection, but he needed to beat ‘the worse evil – his depression’. He said when he last saw Thorpe in December, he had completely lost interest in swimming. Touretski had advised him to play tennis. ‘He absolutely needs to find something that can replace swimming in his life,’ the coach told Ticino News. Touretski said he was convinced Thorpe would make a full recovery, and hoped there would be a happy ending of this ‘stormy period’. ‘Ian has to protect himself , he must find his angel to guard him ,' said Touretski. ‘The fact that so many people care about him, can only be good for him. ‘This infection will pass, I'm sure. But [he needs to defeat] the worse evil, his depression.’ This morning Thorpe's former Olympic swimming teammate Michal Klim tweeted: 'Sending my thoughts + best wishes to @IanThorpe in overcoming his health issues. Draw on the past that made you our best athlete of all time.' The five-time Olympic gold medallist has had a difficult time since his glory days at the 2000 Sydney Olympics. Thorpe revealed in his 2013 autobiography, This Is Me: The Autobiography, that he has been battling ‘crippling depression’ for more than a decade. In the book, Thorpe wrote about how he had at times considered suicide and confessed to drinking huge quantities of alcohol to deal with his depression. Despite an ill-fated attempt to qualify for the 2012 Olympics, Thorpe wanted to continue swimming and had been training as recently as August 2013. He had hoped to gain selection in Australia’s Commonwealth Games team to compete in Scotland this year but a shoulder injury ruined his chances and he conceded that his career was over. Shortly after London 2012 he moved to Switzerland, but returned to Australia in December last year. Thorpe had yet to decide on a . post-swimming career but he made a very successful foray into commentary . with the BBC at the London Olympics. Thorpe’s . manager, James Erskine, told the ABC in February: ‘He made the decision . [last year] that he would give up competitive swimming. There is plenty . of things to do in life after swimming. He loves cooking, travel, and . is a natural for television. ‘[He needs to find something that will] give him the same type of satisfaction [as swimming]. ‘There . wouldn’t be an Australian who is living today who hasn’t got the pride . and joy of seeing Ian Thorpe swimming and winning gold medals, and who . wouldn’t wish him well,’ Mr Erskine added.

"By . Kieran Corcoran . A businessman who destroyed his 40-year marriage by ‘putting to death’ his wife’s pet ram has been ordered to pay her £170,000 a year in maintenance. The globe-trotting couple – whose property portfolio includes a £15million home in Camden, north London – enjoyed a life of luxury until the pet was slaughtered at one of their homes in the south of France. Mr Justice Mostyn said the ram’s death last year followed an ‘animated argument’ between the husband, 68, and his 70-year-old wife and it was ‘perhaps unsurprising that the relationship irretrievably collapsed at that point’. Put to death: The husband caused a 'very animated' row by killing her wife's pet ram, a High Court Judge said . The mother of two issued a divorce . petition in London, insisting her ‘completely Anglicised’ husband had . made his home in the UK, although he had for years insisted to the tax . authorities that he had ‘non-dom’ status. The . husband, whose main interests are said to be shooting and fine wine, . had spent over 110 days in England in the past 12 months – more than . anywhere else in the world – and the wife therefore had an ‘arguable . case’ he was domiciled here, the judge ruled. The . wife had claimed more than £390,000 in annual maintenance to tide her . over, including £24,000 for ‘clothes and footwear’. However, Mr Justice . Mostyn trimmed this down to £170,000 a year. The . case will return to court when a judge will decide if the English . courts have jurisdiction to hear the wife’s divorce petition. Details of the couple's disputes emerged after a private hearing in the Family Division of the High Court in London. Mr Jusitce Mostyn said: 'After over 40 years of marriage, relations between the parties in 2011 soured and, in that year, according to the wife, the husband asked for a separation,' said Mr Justice Mostyn in a written ruling on a preliminary dispute about maintenance. Ruling: The case was heard in the family division of the High Court, which sits in the Royal Courts of Justice in London, pictured . Row: The dispute took place in the South of France. Pictured is Cannes harbour (file photo) 'In June 2013, relations between the parties irretrievably broke down, when the parties had a most animated argument in the south of France, in circumstances where the husband had put to death the wife’s pet ram.' Mr Justice Mostyn said the woman applied for maintenance, pending a trial of the couple’s claims over money, at a hearing in March. £170,000  Rent in London£70,000    Holidays and flgiths£24,000    Clothes and shoes£18,000    Restaurants£7,000      Health insurance£6,000      Lease on a car . The woman’s 'budget' included £18,000 a year for restaurants, £70,000 for holidays and European flights, and £24,000 for clothes and footwear. The man said her claims, which totalled £393,000 a year, were 'too high'. Mr Justice Mostyn said he had concluded that she should be paid around £14,166 a month - about £170,000 a year - in maintenance. Her revised budget included £12,000 for clothes and shoes, £50,000 for flights and holidays and £10,000 for restaurants. Mr Justice Mostyn added that there was no suggestion the man would struggle to pay the huge sums for his wife's upkeep. His judgment also dealt with the issue of 'divorce tourism' raised by the fact that the man and woman are filing for divorce in separate countries in an apparent bid to get a better settlement. Mr Justice Mostyn said: 'It is perfectly obvious what the motives of the parties were in issuing proceedings respectively in England and Austria. 'The wife obviously believes that she will be afforded more generous treatment by this court than in the court of her homeland.  The husband believes that he will be afforded more conservative and, therefore to him, more generous treatment in the court of his wife's homeland.' However he added that under European law there is nothing to stop claimants 'shopping' for a better deal, and that to an extent the practice is 'encouraged' by the lack of clauses to stop it. The case is due to continue at a further hearing in December.","Successful businessman, 68, killed the animal belonging to his wife, 70 .

"By . Associated Press . and Zoe Szathmary . A Houston woman was convicted of murder Tuesday for fatally stabbing her boyfriend with the 5½-inch stiletto heel of her shoe, hitting him at least 25 times in the face. Prosecutors said Ana Trujillo used her high heel shoe to kill 59-year-old Alf Stefan Andersson during an argument at his Houston condominium in June. Trujillo's attorney had argued the 45-year-old woman was defending herself during an attack by Andersson, a University of Houston professor and researcher. Guilty: Ana Lilia Trujillo, left, sits in the courtroom before opening arguments in her trial. On Tuesday she was convicted of murdering boyfriend Alf Andersson . Weapon: Prosecutors present the stiletto used to kill Andersson . Is this how it happened? Prosecutor John Jordan is seen in this April 1 photo in a crime scene demonstration using a dummy . Trujillo, who faces up to life in prison, showed little emotional reaction when the jury verdict was read. The jury deliberated for two hours and is expected to begin hearing evidence in the trial's punishment phase on Wednesday. Police say the couple went out to a Houston bar and got into a fight when another man offered to buy Trujillo a drink. During the trial, prosecutors portrayed Trujillo, a native of Mexico, as out of control on the night of the slaying. A cab driver who took the couple home before Andersson's death told jurors that Trujillo was angry and yelling on the ride to his condo. Prosecutors told jurors that once the couple got home, they began arguing and during the confrontation, Andersson was injured and fell on his back. Trujillo sat on Andersson, preventing him from getting up and repeatedly struck him in the face and head with her shoe, they said. During witness testimony, prosecutors highlighted that Trujillo did not have any injuries from her confrontation with Andersson while the researcher had defensive wounds on his hands and wrists. Trujillo's attorneys argued she did have injuries. Emotional: Ana Trujillo, left, reacts to hearing a 911 call during her trial on April 1 in Houston . Victim: Andersson, pictured, was killed with the stiletto . Witnesses portrayed Andersson, a native of Sweden who became a U.S. citizen, as mild-mannered and quiet. In a video of Trujillo's police interrogation that was played at trial, she told detectives Andersson had become enraged after thinking she was going to leave him, attacked her and that she used the only weapon she had at her disposal — her shoe — to defend herself. Trujillo told detectives she hit Andersson with her shoe 'a couple of times' and didn't realize she had hurt him until she saw blood on the floor. Trujillo told detectives she tried performing CPR on Andersson. The blue suede stiletto heel — a size 9 platform pump with a 5 1/2-inch heel — was brought out during testimony about the bloody crime scene. Testimony during the trial showed that Andersson purchased the shoes. In video and photos taken by police at the crime scene, the stiletto heel can be seen lying on the carpeted floor of Andersson's condominium, above his head. A large pool of blood was also near his head, which was bloodied, purple and had several visible wounds.","Ana Trujillo was convicted of murder for stabbing boyfriend Alf Andersson 25 times in the face with a stiletto heel in June .

"By . Jack Doyle . Whistleblower: Metropolitan Police constable James Patrick, who described how 'massaging' crime figures was common practice . Police are failing to properly record crimes as serious as rape to hit performance targets, a damning report has revealed. A target culture within policing has created ‘perverse incentives’ and driven officers up to the most senior level to ‘misrecord’ crime, MPs said. The Public Administration select committee called for local Police and Crime Commissioners to abolish all targets to  help restore public trust in  crime figures. They also called for an investigation into treatment of a police officer who blew the whistle on corrupt recording practices. Former Metropolitan Police officer James Patrick described how massaging numbers to hit targets had become ‘an ingrained part of policing culture’. He exposed how crimes were routinely downgraded, with robberies logged as theft and burglary reclassified as criminal damage – or even ‘no-crimed’ – to make them ‘disappear in a puff of smoke’. He resigned last month after an investigation into misconduct was launched. The report was published as a new YouGov poll for Channel 5 found 40 per cent of Britons think crime has gone up in the last decade. This is despite police figures and the national crime survey showing sharp falls in crime levels. Bernard Jenkin, the committee chairman, said it was ‘depressing’ how the officer was treated by the Met and claimed most forces were ‘still in denial about the damage targets cause, both to data integrity and to standards of behaviour’. The report found crime figures recorded by the police vastly exaggerated the extent of genuine decreases in recent years. National targets for crime figures have been abolished by the Home Office. But the report found targets, and a target culture, remained at a local level, set by Police and Crime Commissioners or senior officers. Most national targets for crime statistics have been completely abolished by the Home Office, but they still remain at a local level, set by Police and Crime Commissioners . These, it said, ‘drive perverse incentives to misrecord crime, tend to affect attitudes and erode data quality’. It went on to warn: ‘The attitudes and behaviour which lead to the misrecording of crime have become ingrained.’ In particular, the report pointed to ‘strong evidence’ that sex crimes such as rape were under-recorded in many areas, with MPs concluding that officers were failing to comply with national crime recording rules. The report also found ministers and statisticians have been ‘too passive’ in failing to confront concerns over the quality of police statistics. Peter Cuthbertson, director of the Centre for Crime Prevention, said: ‘It’s encouraging that this issue is being investigated by Parliament but the findings are damning. ‘There should really be only one way the police make crime figures look better: by catching more criminals and bringing them to justice. Anything else is fiddling the figures.’ Shadow police minister Jack Dromey said the credibility of the Government’s crime statistics now ‘lies in tatters’. Earlier this year, police crime figures were stripped of their national kitemark by the statistics watchdog – official recognition of the fact they could no longer be trusted. However Chief Constable Alex Marshall, chief executive of the College of Policing, pointed to the new Code of Ethics for officers. He said: ‘In terms of crime recording, the Code specifically highlights the importance  of accurate and honest record-keeping.’","Target culture within the police called 'perverse'

"By . Lizzie Edmonds . After paying £360 for hair extensions and a cut and blow dry, Janice Khoo was unhappy with the result and complained on the salon’s Facebook page. What happened next left her lost for words as the hairdresser, Drew Carlton, replied with a torrent of abuse. Writing on the web page, the crimper called her a ‘whining, whingeing old bag’ and ‘a prize ****’, and added: ‘Kindly **** off.’ Scroll down for video . Janice Khoo, 57, who was subjected to a vile online rant from the owner of Future Lengths Hair Salon after she left a negative review of the hairdressers on Facebook. In the tirade, she was called a 'witch' and 'old bag' Salon owner Drew Carlton - who first threw Mrs Khoo out of his salon before writing a vile online message about her on Facebook . The hair-raising drama began when Mrs Khoo, 57, visited the Future Lengths salon in Swindon, Wiltshire, last month. She . said Mr Carlton’s styling left her looking like she had ‘just got out . of bed’, but claims that when she asked him to put some curlers in to . give it more body, he flew into a rage, swore at her and ordered her out . of the shop. After she . complained on Facebook, Mr Carlton went online to hit back. He wrote: . ‘Too busy and too fabulous to deal with your neurotic projections Mrs! ‘Maybe . you should see a shrink for your histrionic personality disorder? You . want to engage me? I will SUE for slander. You are a whining, winging . [sic] old bag, END OF!’ Mrs Khoo's Facebook post pictured next to Mr Carlton's. The customer's one-star review reads: 'The worst salon experience of my life. Traumatized by Drew's ferocious outburst' A closer view of Mr Cartlon's rant, left on a public area of his company's Facebook page. The owner has since admitted his words were 'completely wrong' and has apologised . Minutes . later he added: ‘Janice Khoo, kindly **** off! Your custom is not . needed! 1st unhappy client in 25 years! YOU LADY, ARE A PRIZE ****! My . customers/clients are always happy, never a BAD one UNTIL YOU! ‘Histrionic personality disorder you old insecure witch!! Go see your psych manager! SLAG!’ His . bizarre tirade - all posted on the public part of his company's page - . saw his 'star rating' plummet, apparently prompting more abuse towards . Janice. He continued to taunt her in a series of now-deleted messages - including one asking the mother-of-two 'you wanna piece of me?' Another said: 'April all booked up!' and added: 'Try again slag, will ensure that you end up with fook-all!' The salon in Swindon. Mrs Khoo, who has now reported the abuse to police, spent £360 on her extensions - which she say made her look like she had 'just got out of bed' Mrs Khoo has reported the abusive to the police and his business page has disappeared from the social networking website. Mr Carlton has since apologised - saying that although Mrs Khoo was a 'difficult customer', his reaction was 'completely wrong.' The bitter battle began after Mrs Khoo visited the salon in Swindon, for extensions to boost the volume in her hair - as well as a cut and blow dry - on March 21. Mrs Khoo has now been offered an apology and full refund from the salon owner . She was happy with the additions to her hair but complained his styling made the top of her hair look flat, and asked him to use curlers to improve the look. In her online review she said: 'The top and fringe looked atrocious and I was dumbfounded that he would let any customer leave his salon with hair in such a state. 'He managed to do the complicated part of the treatment well, but his frustration at his own ineptitude with the much simpler task seemed to be more than he could bear. 'He completely lost control and an aggressive and threatening part of his personality shot to the surface. 'He told me that he was ""fed up with your whingeing"" which was peculiar since I was only politely asking a totally reasonable request to someone I believed to be a skilled stylist. 'He then proceeded to enter a self-induced frenzy in which he started ranting and swearing at me, pacing up and down like a caged wild animal.' Mrs Khoo - who does not wish to reveal her line of work for fear of her professional online profile being targeted by the salon - added: 'I was left upset and traumatised after an onslaught which amounted to an aggressive tirade of obscene verbal abuse - all I did was ask for more body in my hair. 'Drew not only swore at me but also shouted at me to ""get out!""' Salon owner Mr Carlton - who has decided to no longer use social media for his business - said Janice had been a difficult customer but his reaction was wrong. He said: 'Her attitude was completely unacceptable - she did nothing but complain. I felt like there was nothing I could do to make this person happy. 'My reaction was completely wrong, but she was accusing me of being very inept. I have been doing what I do for 25 years, and I have never had a cross word with a client before now. 'What really upset me was that she accused me of being unprofessional. I will be the first person to say my reaction was out of order, but I wanted to protect my business. I realise now that probably did more harm. 'In those situations it is fight or flight mode, but the problem is once you have done it you can't take it back. 'I would be more than happy to apologise to her and refund her money.' A spokeswoman for Wiltshire Police said that the incident had been reported to them and been logged as 'anti social behaviour'. She said: 'Officers have spoken to the lady and will be speaking to Mr Carlton in due course.' 96642 . 213229 . 63872 . 229437 . 30558 . 37315 . 52096 .","Janice Khoo unhappy with extensions put in at Future Lengths Hair Salon .

"By . Jack Doyle . Mass spying claims made by Edward Snowden were rejected last night by a surveillance watchdog. Documents stolen by the rogue US agent led to reports in the Guardian as well as US newspapers that the secret services were snooping on millions of ordinary citizens. But in a report yesterday, Sir Anthony May ruled that MI5, MI6 and GCHQ, were not engaged in ‘mass intrusion’. Exile: Edward Snowden speaking during a presentation ceremony in Moscow last year. Today a communications watchdog ruled the intelligence services were not involved in 'mass intrusion' However the Interception of Communications Commissioner did raise fears that the police were engaged in the ‘institutional overuse’ of surveillance powers. Constabularies carried out more than half a million electronic spying missions last year, the equivalent of more than 1,400 a day, his review said. Sir Anthony said he was concerned that police and the National Crime Agency were failing to consider privacy issues. By contrast, the former high court judge gave the three intelligence and security agencies a clean bill of health following a wide-ranging review of their activities. He said they did not ‘misuse’ the powers given to them by Parliament to engage in ‘random mass intrusion in to the private lives of law abiding citizens’. Such acts are not permitted by law and would be ‘comprehensively unlawful’, he added. Speech: Yesterday, the rogue agent joined a discussion via video-link, about the US government's use of mass surveillance during a parliamentary session in Strasbourg . The public should be reassured that unless they ‘associate with potential terrorists or serious criminals ... none of the interception agencies has the slightest interest in examining their emails, their phone or postal communications or their use of the internet’, he said. Sir Anthony also rejected allegations that spying agencies were ‘getting around the law’ by receiving intercepted communications about British citizens indirectly from US spy agencies. Judgement: Sir Anthony May, the Interception of Communications Commissioner, ruled that MI5, MI6 and GCHQ, were not engaged in 'mass intrusion' Even when large amounts of material were collected by agencies, GCHQ was not permitted to  trawl through it indiscriminately,  he found. Senior intelligence figures have criticised the publication of Snowden’s stolen files. The head of MI5, Andrew Parker, said the publication of the top secret material had caused huge ‘harm’ to the capability of Britain’s intelligence services and amounted to a ‘gift’ to terrorists. Whitehall officials say it is considered to have caused the greatest damage to the Western security apparatus in history. Snowden, a former contractor with the US National Security Agency, stole tens of thousands of restricted files and leaked them to the Guardian and the Washington Post. He sought refuge in Russia where he was granted temporary asylum last summer. Home Secretary Theresa May said the report ‘makes clear the intelligence agencies, law enforcement agencies and other public authorities operate lawfully, conscientiously and in the national interest’. Foreign Secretary William Hague, who has responsibility for GCHQ, said: ‘A senior and fully independent judge has looked in detail at whether the interception agencies misuse their powers to engage in random mass intrusion. He has concluded that the answer is emphatically no.’ Sir Anthony criticised the police’s use of communications data – which can show where users are sending emails and who they are calling, but not the content of any messages. He said the ‘very large number’ of 514,608 requests in 2013 showed officers may be using their powers as an automatic resort rather than worrying about privacy.","Documents stolen by rogue US agent were leaked to the media .
