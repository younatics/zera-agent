"(CNN) -- Japanese fishermen have taken the offensive in their fight against the owner of the stricken Fukushima Daiichi power plant, angrily calling the utility's actions insulting, incompetent and ""unforgivable"" over the course of the weeks-long nuclear crisis. The National Fishery Corporative Joint Association, a trade group for Japan's fishing industry, issued a scathing statement on Wednesday just hours after meeting with officials from the Tokyo Electric Power Company, which runs the crippled plant. In it, the group demanded that the utility and Japanese government ""compensate all parties (that have) indirectly or directly suffered"" as a result of the situation. ""Tokyo Electric has not been capable of understanding the damage at the plant and (contaminated) water. That led to this serious situation,"" the group said in the statement. ""Tokyo Electric and the government (share) responsibility for this situation. It is unforgivable,"" the message continues. ""All those who are living and sustaining their lives on the sea are feeling strong rage against (the utility and the government's) irresponsible behavior."" Members of the fishing group said they are particularly angry about the decision made and enacted Monday to dump 11,500 tons of radioactive water into the Pacific Ocean. This happened just hours after the group specifically requested it not be done -- leaving its members feeling ignored. Besides that complaint, fishery association representatives blasted Tokyo Electric's claim that nuclear power plants were safe and that such accidents would never happen. An official from the utility company said Tokyo Electric officials offered apologies and vowed to improve the situation. This was shortly after they confirmed, early Wednesday, that one leak outside the No. 2 reactor, through which water that had radiation levels millions of times the legal limit, was rushing into the sea. Mincing no words, the fishing industry demanded as much -- saying that stopping leaks of contaminated water into the sea was needed ""to prevent the death of the fishing industry."" ""We demand that Tokyo Electric and the government react to all the problems provoked by this outrageous decision (to dump radioactive water in the sea) and flush out highly contaminated water"" now in the ocean, the association said in its statement said. Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Yukio Edano on Wednesday apologized for how the government had communicated why the dump of radioactive water was necessary. He explained that it contained 1/200,000ths the level of radiation as that in and around the No. 2 reactor, one of six at the nuclear plant, and that authorities decided to clear out the less radioactive liquid in order to make room in a waste water treatment facility. ""So it was a measure to prevent more serious marine contamination,"" the Japanese official said. ""But we needed to explain the reasoning better to the people (impacted by it)."" Whatever the radiation level, Timothy Jorgensen, chair of the radiation safety committee at Georgetown University Medical Center, explained that this dumped water should quickly dilute considering it is equivalent to dumping five swimming pools worth of water into a Pacific Ocean that has roughly ""300 trillion swimming pools full of water."" Still, Japanese authorities have noted higher-than-normal radiation levels in some young eels. And in addition to its impact on aquatic life directly, some fear the mere possibility of radiation in seafood may deter consumers domestically and abroad from eating products that originated in waters off Japan. Citing such ""rumors,"" Edano said Tuesday that authorities will step up the monitoring of radiation in seafood, partly in a bid to assure the public that whatever gets on the market is safe. The new Japanese government standards will rely upon enforcement by city and town health inspectors, not those with the prefectures, according to Edano. As with milk and vegetables, certain fish can be removed from the restricted list if levels of radiation come in below the legal limits for three weeks in a row. As to the fishermen themselves, the Cabinet minister said Wednesday that, in addition to a larger compensation package to be decided upon later, the government is considering a preemptive payout. Similar payments will likely go to farmers, who have been explicitly affected by the nuclear crisis much longer than those in the fishing industry. Japan first imposed restrictions on the sale and distribution of milk and certain vegetables, like spinach, on March 20 -- more than two weeks before Edano announced Tuesday that radiation levels would similarly be regulated in seafood. One scientist, whose institute will start conducting research next month tracking radiation off Japan, said it's likely that such levels in fish will increase for six months -- as the contamination gets in the food supply -- then gradually go down over two or more years. Still, given the standards now being set, he thinks people should feel comfortable eating seafood from Japan. ""The current regulations are quite reasonable,"" said Jin Misonou, a research fellow for the Tokyo-based Marine Ecology Research Institute. ""So, of course, please eat fish. It is good to revive the fishing industry."" CNN's Kyung Lah and journalists Hiroo Saso and Gen Shimada contributed to this report.","Members of Japan's fishery association met Wednesday with Tokyo Electric officials .

"(CNN) -- AC Milan took a giant step toward wresting the Italian Serie A title off Internazionale after Alexandre Pato scored twice in Saturday's 3-0 derby victory at the San Siro, which ended with both teams reduced to 10 men. Inter's reign stretches back to the 2005-06 season, but the second-placed Nerazzurri -- coached by former Milan boss Leonardo -- now trail the Rossoneri by five points with seven games to play. Zlatan Ibrahimovic scored the winner against his former team when Milan beat Inter in November, but his suspension meant that Pato led the attack along with fellow Brazilian Robinho. And the 21-year-old gave Milan -- whose last league crown came in 2004 -- the lead after only 44 seconds. He played a one-two with Gennaro Gattuso on the edge of the Inter area but the veteran midfielder's attempted return pass went into the path of the onrushing Robinho, and Pato pounced on the loose ball to beat compatriot goalkeeper Julio Cesar. Cesar was almost beaten again seven minutes before halftime, but Mark van Bommel's deflected shot looped onto the top of the bar and to safety. Inter should have equalized two minutes before the break, but top scorer Samuel Eto'o made an uncharacteristic miss as he scuffed his shot wide of the goal. His team's hopes of gaining parity suffered a huge blow nine minutes after the interval when last man Christian Chivu was sent off for clipping the heels of Pato as the forward burst towards Cesar's goal. Pato, playing in his first Milan derby, doubled the lead in the 62nd minute when he headed home from Ignazio Abate's mishit shot after the right-back was put in space by Clarence Seedorf. Milan had the ball in the net for a third time in the 76th minute, but second-half substitute Mathieu Flamini -- who replaced Gattuso -- had clearly strayed offside. But another goal inevitably came, with substitute Antonio Cassano scoring from the penalty spot after being dragged down by Javier Zanetti -- his third since joining from Sampdoria in the January transfer window. But the former Italy forward ruined his own night by getting booked twice within a minute -- the first for taking his shirt off to celebrate his goal and the second for a poorly-timed tackle on substitute Ivan Cordoba. The result means Inter will lose second spot if Napoli win at home to fifth-placed Lazio on Sunday. Inter still hold a 64-60 advantage in the 176 meetings between the bitter rivals, but must now recover for Tuesday's opening home leg of the Champions League quarterfinal against German club Schalke. In Saturday's other match, Brescia moved out of the relegation zone on goal difference above Cesena with a 3-1 win at home to 10th-placed Bologna.","AC Milan move five points clear of second-placed champions Inter with 3-0 derby win .

"(CNN) -- The number of people in Japan who killed themselves last year because they couldn't find a job jumped 20%, the National Police Agency reported Thursday. The figures were released as part of the agency's annual study of suicides. In 2010, 424 people killed themselves because they failed to find a job, according to the NPA.  In 2009, the number was 354. Police said the greatest growth in the category came among students.  In 2009, 23 students killed themselves. In 2010, the number grew to 53 -- a 130% increase. The stark figures stood in contrast to the overall decrease in the number of suicides in Japan, down 3.5% to 31,690.  About 127 million people live in the island nation. Police figures also showed an increase in the number of child caretakers who killed themselves. The number in 2010 grew to 157, up 44% from 2009. Japan has one of the developed world's highest suicide rates. The Health, Labor and Welfare Ministry says the number of suicides in Japan has been over 30,000 per year for 13 years in a row. Prime Minister Naoto Kan has made tackling suicides one of his priorities, saying, in the past that he aimed to ""reduce the factors that make people unhappy."" On World Suicide Prevention Day last September, the government launched a website featuring a popular soccer star, urging the country become more aware of the warning signs of suicide. But the suicide rate persists, in a society where a stigma surrounds mental health issues.","Some 31,690 people committed suicide in Japan in 2010 .

"(CNN) -- Wayne Rooney's second-half hat-trick helped Manchester United move seven points clear in the English Premier League on Saturday as title rivals Arsenal and Chelsea were both held to draws. United trailed 2-0 after only 25 minutes against relegation-threatened West Ham, but Rooney scored three goals in 14 minutes before substitute Javier Hernandez sealed a controversial 4-2 victory. Both West Ham's goals came from the penalty spot, with midfielder Mark Noble scoring after Patrice Evra handled Carlton Cole's flick and then Nemanja Vidic fouled the striker on the edge of the area. The home fans were furious when the Serbian defender remained on the pitch despite illegally denying striker Demba Ba what appeared to be a goalscoring opportunity, and United hit back in the second half after bringing on strikers Hernandez and Dimitar Berbatov to replace Evra and midfielder Park Ji-Sung. Rooney curled in a superb free-kick in the 65th minute, then leveled eight minutes later with the 100th Premier League goal of his career. The England striker completed his fourth league treble from the penalty spot after his international teammate Matthew Upson somewhat unluckily handled a cross by Fabio Da Silva as he regained his footing. Mexico forward Hernandez sealed the victory from Ryan Giggs' cross with six minutes to play to give United a morale-boosting win ahead of Wednesday's first leg of the Champions League quarterfinal at Chelsea. The London club, however, will go into the match knowing their Premier League title defense is realistically over with eight rounds to play after drawing 1-1 at Stoke. Carlo Ancelotti's team are now 11 points off the pace, but United have played one more game than the rest of the top five. Striker Jon Walters gave 10th-placed Stoke the lead in the eighth minute after surging forward from the halfway line, but Ivory Coast star Didier Drogba leveled with his first goal since January 24 with a header from Nicolas Anelka's cross in the 33rd minute. Drogba twice hit the woodwork, while Stoke's Marc Wilson and Robert Huth were both denied by the crossbar. Ancelotti brought on Fernando Torres for Anelka after an hour, but the Spain striker is still yet to score following his $80 million move from Liverpool in January. Second-placed Arsenal no longer have the distraction of playing in Europe, but Arsene Wenger's team's poor run continued with a 0-0 draw at home to 10-man Blackburn. The visitors had Steven Nzonzi sent off with 14 minutes to play after a two-footed challenge on defender Laurent Koscielny, but Arsenal could not force a winning goal and have now triumphed in just one game in seven in all competitions. Fifth-placed Tottenham also suffered frustration ahead of Tuesday's Champions League quarterfinal first leg away to Real Madrid, being held goalless by bottom team Wigan. The result was a big blow in the London team's hopes of qualifying for next season's premier European competition, with fourth-placed Manchester City three points ahead of Harry Redknapp's side ahead of Sunday's home match against Sunderland. Liverpool's bid to catch Tottenham and secure a Europa League place faltered after a 2-1 defeat at former manager Roy Hodgson's new team West Brom. Slovakia defender Martin Skrtel headed Liverpool into the lead five minutes after halftime, but Chris Brunt leveled with a penalty just after the hour and then netted the winner from the spot with a minute to go as Nigeria striker striker Peter Odemwingie was fouled both times. The result lifted West Brom into 12th place, four points above the relegation zone. Seventh-placed Everton moved to within four points of local rivals Liverpool after snatching a 2-2 draw at home to Aston Villa, who came from behind to lead with a double from England striker Darren Bent. Leighton Baines leveled with a penalty seven minutes from fulltime after Cameroonian midfielder Jean Makoun fouled Phil Jagielka. Eighth-placed Bolton lost 2-1 at Birmingham, a victory which lifted the League Cup winners out of the bottom three as veteran striker Kevin Phillips and midfielder Craig Gardner scored before Johan Elmander's consolation. Newcastle moved up to ninth place with a 4-1 win over second-bottom Wolverhampton, who remained behind West Ham on goal difference.","Leaders Manchester United come from two goals down to beat struggling West Ham .

"(CNN)  -- Manchester City thrashed Sunderland 5-0 to keep alive their slim English Premier League title hopes and to cement their position in the top four Champions League places. England international Adam Johnson, making his first start since injuring his ankle in January, opened the scoring in the ninth minute while captain Carlos Tevez doubled the Blues' advantage on the quarter hour from the penalty spot. Second-half strikes from David Silva, Patrick Vieira and Yaya Toure completed the rout as City went above reigning champions Chelsea into third in the standings. They are six points clear of fifth-placed Tottenham, who pipped them for the final Champions League place last season, but have played a game more. Leaders Manchester United have a seven-point lead over Arsenal, who have played a game less, with their neighbors City 10 points adrift. The strikes from Johnson, who exchanged passes with Toure before finishing neatly, and Tevez, who was fouled by Michael Turner to draw the penalty, effectively ended the match as a contest with City always in command against a Sunderland side in poor recent form. Silva scored after a Mario Balotelli shot was blocked, Vieira with his first touch after coming off the bench and Toure after an error by Sunderland captain Lee Cattermole. City's Dutch international Nigel de Jong said the result was important for their Champions League ambitions. ""There are still seven games to go and anything can happen but this is a great confidence boost for our team -- we are real contenders for the Champions League places."" he told Sky Sports. In Italy's Serie A, Uruguay striker Edinson Cavani scored a hat-trick as Napoli came back from 2-0 and 3-2 down to beat Lazio 4-3 to move into second. They trail leaders AC Milan by just three points after their 3-0 derby victory over reigning champions Inter Milan, who are now third, five points adrift, on Saturday night. Goals from Stefano Mauri and Andre Dias gave Lazio a two-goal lead before Andrea Dossena and Cavani, with his first, drew Napoli level in a thriller. A Salvatore Aronica own goal put the visitors back in front but Cavani, from the penalty spot, equalized and then grabbed a superb winner for Walter Mazzarri's team. Lazio finished with 10-men as Giuseppe Biava after was sent off in giving away the penalty. Cavani tried his best to shrug off title talk after their superb win. ""We try to win every game and to do our best and the points will be counted up at the end of the season,"" he told Sky Sport Italia. Defeat for Lazio dents their Champions League hopes as they stay outside of the top four in Italy. In Spain's La Liga, second half penalties from Mali international Freddy Kanoute and Spanish striker Alvaro Negredo helped Sevilla to a 3-1 home win over strugglers Real Zaragoza. The victory sees them move to fifth in the standings. Diego Perotti had put Sevilla ahead on 43 minutes only for giant Czech Jiri Jarosik to level two minutes after the break.","Manchester City thrash Sunderland 5-0 to move into third place in  Premier League .

"(CNN) -- The National Transportation Safety Board will probe part of the country's tour bus industry in the wake of a deadly crash in New York last month, two lawmakers announced Sunday. The NTSB will ""launch a broad investigation into the entire safety regime that governs the low-cost tour bus industry,"" Sen. Charles Schumer and Rep. Nydia Velazquez said. The two New York Democrats said the decision is the result of their urging following a March 12 accident that killed 15 people. ""March's bus crash was a tragedy for New York, but these passengers did not have to die in vain,"" Schumer said in a statement Sunday. ""A full and comprehensive review of this industry and the safety regulations governing it will no doubt lead to greater safety standards for the thousands of passengers who use these buses every week."" ""By ensuring NTSB thoroughly reviews how this industry is regulated, we can keep passengers safe, while restoring consumers' confidence in this type of travel,"" Velazquez said in the statement. A similar NTSB review of airline safety ""led to major improvements,"" the joint statement by the lawmakers' offices said. Schumer has also asked New York state's Department of Motor Vehicles to re-examine all drivers of low-cost tour buses for previous safety violations and suspended licenses. If such an audit had taken place before the March 12 crash, it would have shown that the driver ""shouldn't have been behind the wheel,"" Schumer said. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo ordered an investigation into how the driver in the crash, Ophadell Williams, got a commercial license despite having a poor driving record and previous convictions of grand larceny and manslaughter. Records on the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration website showed that the bus line involved -- World Wide Travel -- was involved in a crash in New York in 2009 that resulted in one injury and a crash in New Jersey in 2010 resulting in another. The company has been cited five times for ""fatigued driving"" between December 2009 and October 2010 -- twice in New Jersey, twice in Pennsylvania and once in Connecticut, records show. Police said Williams told investigators that the incident occurred the morning of March 12 after he swerved to avoid a tractor-trailer that might have clipped the bus. The bus then flipped on its side and smashed into poles, which cut through two-thirds of the vehicle. Williams has not been charged. His license was suspended on March 17 after the Department of Motor Vehicles turned over to investigators driver license applications that allegedly contained false statements. Two survivors of the Bronx bus accident have filed multimillion-dollar lawsuits against the bus company and against Williams. Yuke Chue Lo and Erold Jean Marie are suing World Wide Tours and Williams for $20 million and $200 million, respectively. Both passengers' court papers allege negligence on the part of the bus operating company for allowing Williams behind the wheel, with that resulting in the deadly crash on March 12. They also allege that Williams was speeding and fell asleep while driving. Williams' lawyer, Sean H. Rooney, has denied that his client fell asleep behind the wheel. He also said Williams does not drink, smoke or use drugs and had passed three Breathalyzer tests and given a blood sample following the crash. Rooney called his client an ""easy target,"" but insisted that he is ""a decent person."" The case has shone light on safety questions surrounding the industry. On one day in March, the state Department of Transportation inspected 14 buses and found violations in every case -- either vehicle violations, which took the buses out of service, or driver violations or both, said agency spokeswoman Deborah Sturm Rausch. The nine driver violations could include anything from a driver with an out-of-date license to one who had logged too many hours on the road, Rausch said. On another day in March, random roadside inspections of 36 commercial buses by troopers resulted in 10 drivers being removed from their buses by their companies and eight traffic tickets issued. None of the vehicles inspected was found inoperable, according to the New York State Department of Transportation.","Sen. Schumer: NTSB investigation will yield greater safety standards .

"(CNN) -- Birmingham, Alabama -- a city with a long history of racial strife -- has been shaken by the release this week of a video recording showing a group of white police officers hitting an African-American man accused of attempting to steal a car. Travarious Daniel, 29, was arrested outside a nightclub in downtown Birmingham shortly after 1 a.m. on March 20.  Video of the arrest shows Daniel, his hands raised in the air, briefly staggering down a sidewalk before being tackled and struck multiple times in the back of the head. A photo published by the Birmingham News shows Daniel with a bandage over a swollen eye after his arrest. Two officers have been placed on paid administrative leave pending the result of an internal investigation, according to Gayle Gear, an attorney for the local Fraternal Order of Police. Calls to the Birmingham's police department were not immediately returned Friday. Daniel has been charged with unlawful breaking and entering of a vehicle and receiving stolen property.  But it is the allegation of police brutality that is drawing attention. ""A group of white policemen and my client is a black victim. Do the math,"" said Charles Salvagio, Daniel's attorney. ""It's very sad that this is being cast as a racial matter,"" Gear replied. ""The police department is color-blind.  This is not a racial matter.  Not at all."" Salvagio said the video, which he released to the media, came from the nightclub's security camera. Daniel works at the club and obtained the video. Birmingham Mayor William Bell -- himself an African-American -- is withholding judgment until the results of an internal investigation. ""The mayor is very disturbed at the video and the images,"" said Chuck Faush, Bell's chief of staff.  But ""there is due process and we will wait to find out the facts."" Faush told CNN the city had been examining the possibility of increased mandatory training on issues related to law enforcement and race before Daniel's arrest.  The city has also been reaching out to local faith-based and other civic leaders to encourage closer ties. ""This heightens what we're trying to do,"" he said. Gear called the mayor ""reasonable"" and said the police welcome the idea of increased training.  But Bell ""does not have a law enforcement background,"" she noted. The video showing Daniel being hit doesn't tell the whole story, Gear said.  She noted that the officers were initially forced to chase Daniel -- who has prior felony convictions -- and that in dealing with a suspect, holding the hands in the air can sometimes be interpreted as an act of defiance. Most people ""see the gentleman with his hands in the air and they think he's giving up,"" she said.  But defendants are told to drop to the ground, and ""if you resist, there will be action taken by the police."" ""They used only the force necessary to (ensure) an arrest,"" she asserted. Salvagio dismissed Gear's claim. ""We have a defense to this, and they know we do,"" he said.  The video is ""clear evidence there are some bad apples in the police department."" Salvagio said Daniel intends to file a lawsuit against the police department.  Daniel's first court hearing on the car theft charge is scheduled for April 11. The mayor's office declined to discuss the possible broader racial ramifications of the case. Birmingham, Alabama's largest city, was the center of the civil rights movement that reverberated through the United States and beyond in the 1950s and 1960s. The Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. was arrested in the city for taking part in a peaceful demonstration, and penned the now-famous ""Letter from Birmingham Jail,"" an open letter in which he spelled out his justifications for civil disobedience: ""... one has a moral responsibility to disobey unjust laws."" The city also suffered the scars of racially motivated bombings during those turbulent years, most notably a blast at the 16th Street Baptist Church that killed four black girls in 1963. The Civil Rights Act, which outlawed racial segregation, was signed by President Lyndon B. Johnson the following year. Still, Birmingham has worked hard to rebuild its infrastructure and its image. In recent years, it has adopted ""The Diverse City"" moniker, ""recognizing the city's undeniable civil rights heritage while promoting its diversified destinations"" as the Birmingham Business Journal once put it. Bell, the mayor, plans to be in Atlanta on Monday as one of the recipients of an award from the Southern Christian Leadership Conference. The ""Keeper of the Dream"" award -- an allusion to King's historic ""I Have a Dream"" speech -- is given to those who work toward improving equality and justice. In Birmingham, ""we embrace our past, but we only use it to build our future,"" Faush said. CNN's Samira J. Simone contributed to this report.","Travarious Daniel, 29, was arrested on March 20 for allegedly breaking into a car .

"Sanaa, Yemen (CNN) -- For the first time since the start of unrest in Yemen's capital, youth protesters numbering in the tens of thousands marched toward the Republican Palace on Monday, eyewitnesses said, in an act of defiance against President Ali Abdullah Saleh's regime. Witnesses told CNN that security forces made no move to repel the youths, who were marching in support of protests Monday in the city of Taiz, where at least 14 people were killed when security forces reportedly opened fire on demonstrators. Field medics in Taiz said more than 500 people were injured, including 154 who suffered gunshot wounds. Medical team leader Sadiq Shugaa said the field hospital ""cannot give health care to all the injured, and is coordinating with hospitals outside Taiz to help the injured."" More than 20 tanks and armored vehicles surrounded the principal government building in Taiz as security forces tried to hold back advancing protesters, a senior government official said. Witnesses said the protesters in Taiz numbered more than 90,000. Another rally Monday in Hodeida, on Yemen's Red Sea coast, was met with sniper bullets and tear gas, witnesses said. At least two people were killed and nine injured there, medical sources said. Witnesses said ""tens of victims"" were laid out on the streets awaiting emergency aid, and more than 300 people were suffering from gas inhalation. The youth protesters in Sanaa, whom witnesses estimated at more than 55,000, were chanting, ""Saleh wait wait, the revolution youth are coming your way!"" The Republican Palace is considered Saleh's second-most important palace after the Presidential Palace. Protests also took place in the cities of Aden and Ibb. A spokesman for the Yemeni opposition called for international help to ""stop the bloodshed caused by the Saleh regime against innocent, peaceful protesters."" ""Saleh is killing people without fear,"" said Mohammed Qahtan, spokesman for the opposition Joint Meeting Parties bloc, ""and the international community must not watch quietly. ""Protesters have been shot by Saleh's snipers today in Taiz and Hodeida. The seat of presidency is more valuable than Yemeni blood,"" Qahtan said. In Washington, White House press secretary Jay Carney said the administration is monitoring the situation in Yemen and has ""been very clear about our view on the need that all sides refrain from violence, that there be an open process that addresses the legitimate needs and aspirations of the Yemeni people."" Carney noted that Saleh has ""publicly indicated his willingness to engage in a peaceful transition of power, and we believe the timing and form of that transition should be accomplished through dialogue and negotiation."" Foreign ministers of the Gulf Cooperation Council member states, who were meeting Monday in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, issued a statement affirming their support for a secure and stable Yemen, and calling on ""all parties ... to return to a national dialogue in order to end the current crisis and maintain the nation's unity and security."" Eyewitnesses in Hodeida said snipers in civilian clothing shot into a crowd of protesters in Change Square on Monday, and security forces used tear gas on demonstrators. A senior government official in Hodeida said the violence began when protesters attempted to get into a palace there. The official said security forces were only defending government property from theft. In Taiz on Sunday, three people were killed and 1,700 injured, according to medical sources, who said the casualties were caused by central security police and riot police. On Sunday, Taiz Gov. Hamoud al-Soufi had denied reports of a killing and said that the clashes did not occur in a city square, but on the main street, the state-run Saba news agency reported. As riot police intervened to clear the road, ""infiltrators and some young hotheads"" threw stones at soldiers, wounding eight, including one seriously, the governor said. The same day, Yemen's parliament speaker rejected a transition plan by the country's largest opposition bloc, indicating a continued stalemate over how Saleh should hand over power. Calls for Saleh's ouster have grown louder in recent weeks following revolutions in Egypt and Tunisia. Saleh has ruled since 1978 and has been fighting to hold on to power, arguing that he is best equipped to lead the fight against radical Islamists. He has been a staunch U.S. ally in the fight against al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. Saleh has offered to step down by the end of the year after constitutional reforms and new elections. The Joint Meeting Parties bloc has demanded Saleh's immediate ouster, and a plan unveiled Saturday called for Saleh to hand over all authority to Vice President Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi, a spokesman for the bloc told reporters. Once power is handed to Hadi, he should change the structure of the security forces -- including the Republican Guard -- in a way that is ""fair"" and in accordance with the Yemeni Constitution, the spokesman said. The bloc wants Hadi, as president, to form a council that focuses on transparency in the military, a national transition council that will represent all factions in the country and a committee to oversee new elections. The bloc also wants him to affirm the right of peaceful protests and investigate allegations of brutality against opposition demonstrators. Yahya Al-Raee, the Parliament speaker who also is a senior officer of the ruling party, dismissed the bloc's plan, saying, ""it was prepared during a khat chew and has no value."" (Many Yemenis chew khat, a tropical plant that acts as a stimulant, as part of social and business transactions.) In Taiz, eyewitnesses said security police aided by riot police moved in before dawn Sunday to try to disperse demonstrators who had gathered the day before. According to the eyewitnesses, some protesters were beaten, and when others tried to help them, the security police fired tear gas.

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- Police have arrested a Pakistani teenager accused of writing insulting comments about Muslim prophet Mohammed in a school exam, a senior police official said. Police arrested 17-year-old Sami Ullah in Karachi after receiving a complaint from the local board of education, said Karachi police official Qudrat Shah Lodhi. Lodhi declined to say what Ullah wrote in his high school exam for fear of violating Pakistan's blasphemy laws himself. The controversial laws say whoever defiles the name of the prophet shall be punished by death or imprisoned for life. The laws came into sharp focus late last year when liberal Pakistani politician Salman Taseer was gunned down after leading a public campaign to change them . Taseer said the laws were being misused to persecute minorities. Ullah -- the latest Pakistani to be accused of blasphemy -- is a Muslim, according to police. He wrote the alleged blasphemous comments when taking a school exam in April 2010, police said. It's not clear why it took months for the board of education's complaint against Ullah to reach police. Ullah has apologized for his comments and begged the court for leniency, police said.

"(CNN) -- A Somali man was sentenced Thursday to 25 years in prison for armed piracy in an attack on a Danish merchant ship that began in 2008 and lasted for 71 days. Jama Idle Ibrahim, aka Jaamac Ciidle, and other pirates held the vessel, the M/V CEC Future, from November 7, 2008, until January 16, 2009 in the Gulf of Aden. The U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia gave Ibrahim the maximum penalty of five years in prison for the piracy conspiracy charge and the maximum penalty of 20 years for the firearm conspiracy charge. The 39-year-old Somali pleaded guilty last year. This is the first conviction in the District of Columbia for a piracy-related offense. According to the Justice Department, the pirates approached the ship in high-speed boats, firing their weapons. They held the ship, cargo and 13 crew members for ransom and forced the crew to anchor in waters off the Somalia coast. During the takeover, additional pirates boarded. They threatened the crew, controlled their movements and stole money, food and supplies. The M/V CEC Future was released after the ship's owner, the Clipper Group, paid a $1.7 million ransom. ""Modern-day pirates are nothing like the swashbuckling heroes in Hollywood movies,"" said U.S. Attorney Ronald Machen in a statement. ""Today's pirates are ruthless criminals who hold ships and their crews hostage with AK-47s and rocket-propelled grenades."" In November 2010, Ibrahim was sentenced to 30 years in prison in the Eastern District of Virginia following a guilty plea to charges stemming from an April 10, 2010, pirate attack on a U.S. Navy vessel, the USS Ashland, in the Gulf of Aden. The sentence from the District of Columbia is to run concurrently with the sentence from Virginia.","D.C. court rules in 2008 case that involved a Danish vessel .

"(CNN) -- As we approached Cowboys Stadium on the outskirts of Dallas in December, I knew we were in for quite an experience. After all, football is almost a religion there. Fans of all ages were filling the huge stadium, not to see a professional game but to watch the state's high school football championships. I met up with Eddie Canales, who was with his son Chris as well as several Gridiron Heroes and their families and caregivers. I could see right away that part of his mission was giving these young men a chance to have some fun. The atmosphere felt like a family reunion, with hugs, jokes and lots of football talk. We looked like a small parade as we rolled into the stadium with five wheelchairs and a large entourage. We were escorted down to the posh club level right behind the sidelines. It was an incredible view of the massive stadium. An enormous high-definition TV hung from the ceiling. At seven stories high, it was said to be the largest television in the world. We headed onto the field with my cameraman to do some filming. I'd been a bit worried about this moment. These young men's lives had been changed on the gridiron; would they feel strange about going back onto a football field? The answer was a resounding no -- everyone seemed excited to be on the spot where the 2011 Super Bowl would be played. When we finished getting our shots, Canales and his group made their way to a front-row handicap-accessible section. As they settled back to watch the game, my cameraman and I got ready to shoot the start of it. Face paint and homemade signs were everywhere. There were massive marching bands and hundreds of cheerleaders and majorettes. Each team had several coaches and a full complement of trainers and support staff. It was all of the ""Friday Night Lights"" spectacle I'd imagined and more. I paused for a moment to take it all in. After all, standing on a professional football field in front of thousands of fans isn't something very many people get a chance to do. Canales and the Gridiron Heroes were thoroughly enjoying the game. Eddie fell into conversations with coaches and trainers who recognized him and wanted to talk about his work, while Chris and the other Gridiron Heroes watched and analyzed each play. Though they were now on the sidelines, it was clear that their life-changing injuries hadn't dimmed their love of the game. In the middle of the third quarter, the announcer gave a shout-out to the group, and fans around the stadium applauded. Canales and the gang cheered to see themselves on the big screen TV. It was the first time they had received recognition at such a large event. Eddie was excited about the gesture of support from the ""governing bodies"" of Texas high school football. The game ended, and we headed onto the field, which was swarmed with players, coaches, fans and the media. Eddie helped Chris maneuver his wheelchair over the turf. Coaches and staff from both sides shook their hands and posed for photos with them. The respect that the players and coaches had for Eddie and Chris was clear. Growing up in Colorado, I'd been an avid Denver Broncos fan, but living in New York and busy with work, I hadn't followed football much in the past decade. Being at that game that day made me remember why I liked football, although watching it alongside Canales and his Gridiron Heroes was a powerful reminder of the game's risks. This was one experience I'll certainly remember for a long time.

"Atlanta, Georgia (CNN) -- Tired of all the squawking about America's unemployment? Try out for a job as a corporate duck. People are lining up in six major cities to audition Monday and Tuesday to be the next quacksperson for the insurance company Aflac. The scene in Atlanta was like the duck itself: grating, conspicuous, and most of all loud. ""Let me hear a duck skydiving,"" said casting director Brian Beagle. ""Aflaaaaac!"" cried Sandy Smith, 54, of Birmingham, Alabama, in her most terrified duck voice. One by one, the hopefuls waddled through, putting their ducks in a row as much as one can for a job limited by one bird and his one word. The contenders were allowed to grunt, groan and mutter, but their only word began with ""A"" and rhymed with quack. They quacked like Donald. They quacked like Daffy. They quacked shy, shrill, scared and silly. Recorders rolled as the wannabes channeled their inner ducks to quack like a duck in love ... a duck answering the phone ... a duck singing about being in love ... a duck on a wire ... a duck flying by ... a duck getting bad news ... another duck in love. Ducks fearful and ducks overjoyed. Traci Naman, 42, of Atlanta didn't wait for a prompt to let loose her quackery. ""I figured he might have an evil twin,"" she said of the Aflac icon. ""And I thought it was time for him to have a girlfriend too."" ""Let's hear a conversation between those three,"" Beagle said. ""You're the first person to present multiple ducks!"" The six-figure voice-over job with benefits opened up after Aflac fired comedian Gilbert Gottfried for his fowl, er foul, Twitter comments regarding the Japan earthquake. The comedian later apologized. Aflac plans to screen about 1,000 live auditions and 12,000 online submissions, with the company's new duck scheduled to quack out a new ad later this month. The duck, said company spokesman Jon Sullivan, perches high on Aflac's organizational chart. ""Everyone is secondary to the duck because the duck is such an amazing campaign,"" he said. ""In the 10 years we've had the duck, our brand identification has gone from slightly more than 10 percent to 92 percent."" Several wannabes compared the odds of getting the job of official squawker to the odds of winning the lottery. Naman, an account manager for 14 years and unemployed for two years, felt triumphant simply by auditioning. ""I've sent out applications and gone to job fairs and it's like throwing your resume into a black hole,"" she said. ""Companies have done a good job of building a wall to keep people out. Just getting this job interview is like winning the lottery."" The long-shot duck gig represented a brass ring to others. The last interview for Wayne Cobb -- a roofing contractor in Stockbridge, Georgia -- was when he was 18. The 61-year-old contestant calmed his pre-quack jitters by rehearsing in front of his grandchildren with a duck puppet. ""It might sound corny, but this job would let me do some landscaping around my church that we don't have the funding to take care of,"" he said. The high stakes prompted Lori A. Preston, 44, to pop peppermints to keep her gullet from quacking hoarse. After her audition, she admitted her work experience with ducks was limited. ""Other than feed them and seeing the water roll off their back, that's about it,"" she said. ""But they [casting directors] asked me to make the duck my own, and that felt really comfortable."" Each audition lasted only minutes, and almost everyone left smiling. Leonard Bates, 56, a retired FedEx shipping agent, felt good as he ducked out. He waved to those in the waiting room and said, ""Let the best quacker win.""","Hundreds of people are quacking their hearts out in auditions to be the Aflac duck .

"(CNN) -- Australian authorities issued a warning Friday to its citizens who may be traveling to Indonesia that the recent arrest of a terror suspect could lead to terror attacks there. ""The reported arrest in Pakistan of Umar Patek, an Indonesian national alleged to be involved in several major terrorist attacks, may increase the risk of violent responses in Indonesia in the short term,"" the warning from the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade said. Patek is one of the top suspects in the Bali bombings that killed more than 200 people in 2002, Indonesian police have said. Several news organizations reported Monday that Patek had been arrested in Pakistan on March 2. Indonesia has sent a team to Pakistan to confirm that it is indeed Patek that was arrested. Michael Tene, spokesman for the Indonesian Foreign Ministry, said he was not sure why Australia issued the warning. ""As far as I know from our security forces, the police, the situation in Indonesia is quite normal. I can't speculate on what specific information the Australian government has that would make them issue this advisory,"" Tene said. Patek, an Indonesian of Javanese and Arab descent, is suspected of acting as the deputy field coordinator of the 2002 bombings in Bali. Seven Americans were killed in the attacks. Authorities and security experts say Patek was a member of the terror network Jemaah Islamiyah, that he took part in the Bali bombings, and that fled to Mindanao in the Philippines in 2003. CNN's Kathy Quiano contributed to this report.","Umar Patek is accused of being part of attack in Bali that killed 203 people .

"Nairobi, Kenya (CNN) -- Three Kenyan political leaders accused of crimes against humanity following the country's disputed 2007 elections had their first appearance Thursday before the International Criminal Court at The Hague. Another three are scheduled to appear Friday. The court's top prosecutor, Luis Moreno Ocampo, named the six as suspects in December, claiming they organized violence that left more than 1,000 people dead and displaced hundreds of thousands more. Former Agriculture Minister William Ruto, opposition leader Henry Kosgey and radio journalist Joshua Arap Sang appeared Thursday.  Deputy Prime Minister Uhuru Kenyatta, Cabinet Secretary Francis Muthaura, and former national police chief Hussein Ali are set to appear Friday. The two groups of three come from opposite sides of the political dispute in Kenya. Ruto, Kosgey, and Sang face four counts of crimes against humanity: murder; deportation or forcible transfer of the population; torture and persecution. The judge set a date for them of September 1 to hear arguments as to whether they should go to trial. Judge Ekaterina Trendafilova quashed their attempts to plead their cases Thursday. When asked whether he understood the allegations, Ruto said he did, but that ""the allegations sound like they came from a movie."" Trendafilova warned the suspects that they should refrain from political activities relating to the case. ""It has come to our knowledge,"" she said, ""that there are some movements towards triggering the violence in the country by way of some speeches. Such type of action could be seen as an inducement and could constitute a breach of conditions."" She warned that if the suspects continued in such a vein that the summons could be turned into ""warrants of arrest."" By late April, the two sides need to meet to start sharing evidence, the judge said. Last month, Kenya challenged the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court, saying its own authorities will investigate and prosecute the cases on Kenyan soil. The Netherlands-based court calls itself, on its website, ""an independent international organization ... established to help end impunity for the perpetrators of the most serious crimes of concern to the international community."" Kenya's disputed presidential election sparked chaos that escalated into ethnic violence pitting supporters of incumbent President Mwai Kibaki against those of challenger Raila Odinga, who was later named prime minister in a power-sharing agreement. Muthaura, Kenyatta and Ali are accused of committing or contributing to the killing, rape and other acts of violence against supporters of the opposition Orange Democratic Movement. Ruto, Sang and Kosgey are accused of being co-perpetrators in the murder, deportation and commission of other offenses against supporters of Kenya's Party of National Unity. E.J. Hogendoorn of the International Crisis Group said the case is ""a major victory, especially for civil society in Kenya, and it is potentially a significant step to the end of impunity in Kenya.""","NEW: Three appear before the ICC .

"(CNN) -- A Utah judge has ordered a registered sex offender who faces nearly two dozen charges of child sex abuse released on the basis that he is mentally incompetent to stand trial. At a hearing on Thursday, Fourth District Judge James Taylor, who previously ruled Lonnie Johnson incompetent to be tried on sex crime charges, said there were no legal grounds for holding him. ""We are at the end of the road...I can't do anything but have him released from the state hospital,"" Taylor said at Thursday's hearing. Taylor said he was following a Utah statute requiring the release of anyone deemed incompetent to stand trial and who has not been convicted of a crime. Johnson, 38, has been diagnosed with a cognitive disorder. Doctors who examined Johnson found his competency could not be restored. They also said he is not a danger to society and did not qualify for involuntary institutional commitment. Johnson faces five counts of rape of a child, six counts of sodomy on a child and 10 counts of aggravated sexual abuse of a child, according to court documents. In 2006, he was convicted of raping a teenage girl in Washington State, sent to prison for third degree rape and served less than a year, according to court documents. He is required to register as a sex offender wherever he lives. ""I am outraged that a convicted child sex offender, currently facing another round of accusations, could be released without being tried for current charges,"" Utah Governor Gary R. Herbert said. ""It's outrageous for both the victims and the accused that Mr. Johnson won't get his day in court,"" he said. In November, a status hearing will be held under the judge's orders and he will appoint two new doctors to evaluate Johnson. Prosecutors have also filed a new motion asking the judge to reopen competency hearings in the criminal case. ""What I wanted to do was jump over and take care of it myself,'' said Christy Danner, whose daughter is an alleged victim of Johnson. ''But that's not what we can do and that's not the way our system works, and we're going to have to fix this system and then hopefully get him back in the state of Utah and find him competent,'' Danner said on HLN's ""Nancy Grace."" Danner cited Johnson's previous ability to hold down jobs and earn a living, and said she thinks Johnson is faking incompetence. Johnson allegedly abused Danner's daughter, who was his niece by marriage, for six years, starting at age eight in 1997. She is now 21. Johnson's family has maintained his innocence, alleging the accusations are related to a bitter divorce case. ""We kind of knew going in today that he was going to be released so we were able to at least anticipate that,"" Danner said. ""But, yeah, we're not happy and the girls are feeling victimized again and our only thing is that we have to close this loophole.""","The judge says he was following a Utah statute .

"Madrid, Spain (CNN) -- The family of an American college student who has been missing for more than a week in Madrid has hired private investigators from California to help search for him, the student's father told CNN on Monday. A small team of investigators from the Halo Corp. is due to arrive in Madrid on Tuesday to search for the San Diego State University student, Austin Taylor Bice, who went missing after a night out with friends, said his father, Larry Bice. Halo's website says it is a San Diego-based company ""founded by former special operations and intelligence personnel."" ""They are helpers,"" the elder Bice told CNN. ""I don't want to give the idea that they are coming here running and gunning because they are not. They are coming to work with the police and do whatever they can."" The missing student, 22, has not been seen by friends since early February 26, when he told them he was going home, alone, while others stayed at a discotheque, family members and friends said. Spanish police are investigating, and a U.S. Embassy official in Madrid has confirmed the missing-person report. The student's father rushed to Madrid from San Diego last Wednesday and has since met several times with Spanish and U.S. authorities. Friends of the student quickly organized a campaign to put up posters of him around Madrid, which read ""Missing. Austin Taylor Bice. U.S. citizen, 22, 1.95 meters tall and 100 kilograms"" (6 feet, 5 inches and 220 pounds). The posters show Bice with a smiling, clean-shaven face, but he started growing a beard two weeks before he went missing, his father said. The posters list two phone numbers -- a friend's cell phone and a police office line -- but the elder Bice said new posters will go up listing two national emergency phone numbers in Spain. There is no indication of a kidnapping, and no demands have been received, his father said. Austin Bice arrived in mid-January for a semester of business-course study at a Madrid university. On February 25, he went out with five friends to a popular Madrid discotheque that doesn't open until midnight. He later left alone, early February 26, saying he was headed home, friends and family members told CNN. A family member last Saturday told CNN that contrary to earlier reports, Bice was not refused entry to the discotheque by doormen and was not drunk, although ""he had a few beers."" Instead, he just decided to go home. ""We always told him, never be by yourself. Always be with somebody. And I think the problem was he got a little bit overconfident and decided that he wanted to go it alone, go back to the house by himself and that was the problem,"" said Juan Gabriel Paredes, a family member who came to Madrid from Wichita, Kansas, to help Bice's father in the search. Paredes said four of Bice's friends went into the discotheque while Bice and another friend remained outside. Eventually Bice decided to go home alone. Dozens of Bice's friends and others responding to internet notifications conducted a search last Saturday, starting from the discotheque, La Riviera, on the banks of the Manzanares River, down a hill and removed by many blocks from the city center. ""I just want to say thank you for all being here. It's hard for me to talk about it, but thank you,"" Bice's father told the search teams, his voice cracking. ""People we've talked to say if it were bad, it would have shown up right away,"" Bice's father told CNN on Thursday in an off-camera interview. ""It's easier being here than at home. I see what's going on."" The student was carrying two credit cards and his California driver's license, his father said. Calls to two cell phones Bice was carrying the night he went missing have gone unanswered, his friends said. The weekend search teams split into four-member groups and fanned out, some heading across the river to a large park, others walking up Calle Segovia toward the city center, where friends said Bice was last seen. The search teams posted more missing-person posters and entered stores and other establishments to ask people if they had seen anything. Some responded that they had seen the news of the missing student on Spanish media. The U.S.-based Institute of International Education said that in 2007, Spain was the third most-popular destination worldwide for Americans studying abroad, after the United Kingdom and Italy. It said there were about 17,000 American students in Spain. Bice was studying in Madrid at the University of Carlos III, which has 18,000 students, including about 220 Americans, the school's director of international relations, Carlos Lopez Terradas, told CNN. His father said, ""It's been hard, real hard. These are the things you hope never happen to you."" He added he would remain in Madrid to follow the search for his son ""as long as I need to.""","Missing-person posters appearing in Madrid and on Spanish media .

"(CNN) -- Manchester United's American owners have again insisted that the English club is not for sale, releasing a short statement while announcing second-quarter financial results on Friday. British media have renewed speculation that Qatar's royal family will make an offer of a reported £1.8 billion ($2.9 billion) for a club that U.S. billionaire Malcolm Glazer and his family bought in 2005 at an overall value of £800 million. ""The board notes recent press speculation regarding a possible bid for Manchester United,"" the statement said. ""The owners remain fully committed to their long-term ownership of the club. ""No discussions have taken place, Manchester United is not for sale and the owners will not entertain any offers."" The Glazers have been criticized by United fans after it was revealed that their takeover involved a £660 million debt in finance leveraging, which they have been paying off with club revenue since. The latest results showed that the 18-time English league champions' turnover for the three months up until December 31, 2010 increased from £87 million ($140 million) to £93.2 million ($150 million). While domestic matchday income for the period dropped slightly from £33.1 million to £32.8 million, and media revenue stayed similar, commercial turnover including overseas merchandising climbed from £19.2 million ($31 million) to £25.5 million ($41 million). Gross debt dropped from £512.5 million ($825 million) to £489.4 million ($787 million) while the board revealed the club had net assets of £771 million ($1.2 billion) and a cash balance of £134.5 million ($216 million). United's bid to win a record 19th domestic crown continues at Wigan on Saturday as Alex Ferguson's team seek to restore a four-point lead over second-placed Arsenal -- who face Birmingham in Sunday's League Cup final.","Glazer family reacts to speculation that Qatar royal family wants to buy the club .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Phillip and Nancy Garrido pleaded not guilty Thursday to all 18 charges relating to the kidnapping and rape of a young California girl who was held captive from age 11 through 29, according to the El Dorado County Superior Court and an attorney. Phillip Garrido earlier had been expected to enter a plea deal, but it was canceled Thursday, his wife's attorney, Stephen Tapson, said during a news conference. Garrido and his wife, Nancy, are accused of snatching Jaycee Dugard when she was 11 and keeping her captive in a compound in Antioch, California. Nancy Garrido had pleaded ""not guilty"" last year, but she had to re-enter the same pleas Thursday because the indictment against her was amended, Tapson told CNN. Phillip Garrido had been expected to plead guilty to all but two counts against him during a court hearing Thursday morning, Tapson said earlier. Garrido decided against pleading guilty because his attorney might challenge the indictment, Tapson said. A criminal complaint against the Garridos could proceed, but the legality of the indictment against them is apparently going to be contested, Tapson said. Phillip Garrido is facing at least 18 counts, including kidnapping, rape and false imprisonment, according to court documents. Dugard was snatched from the street in front of her home in South Lake Tahoe, California, in 1991. Authorities found her in 2009. Phillip Garrido, a registered sex offender on parole at the time of his arrest, is accused of fathering two daughters with Dugard during her captivity. Garrido's attorney, Susan Gellman, could not be reached for comment. Tapson said Nancy Garrido confessed that she was involved in the kidnapping but denies she had anything to do with the sex crimes. Nancy Garrido had been offered a plea deal but it ""evaporated,"" Tapson said. Under the plea deal, Nancy Garrido was offered a prison sentence of about 40 years with the potential of being released sooner, Tapson said. The family of Jaycee Dugard approved Nancy Garrido's plea deal, Tapson said. But then detectives questioned Nancy Garrido about other California children who went missing the same time that Phillip Garrido was living in northern California, Tapson said. Nancy Garrido said she had no information, and the plea deal was withdrawn, Tapson said. Authorities have wanted to question Nancy Garrido because her husband has been a lead suspect in the case of 9-year-old Michaela Garecht, who disappeared in 1988 in Hayward, California. That case was profiled in February on HLN's ""Nancy Grace America's Missing,"" during which the lead detective, Rob Lampkin of the Hayward Police Department, said that Phillip Garrido was their top suspect in the girl's disappearance. Lampkin said Garrido lived in a halfway house about 20 minutes from a market parking lot where Michaela was abducted. Also on the show, the girl's mother said she believed Nancy Garrido could provide answers to what happened to her daughter.

Authorities found the graves during an investigation into a report of the kidnapping of passengers from a bus in late March. The investigation led them to the town of San Fernando, the same place where in August of last year the bodies of 72 immigrants were found at a ranch. This time, authorities arrested 11 suspects and rescued five hostages, the state attorney general's office said. They also discovered the eight mass graves. There were 11 bodies found in the first six graves, 43 bodies in the seventh, and five in the eighth, the agency said. Forensic investigators will examine the bodies in an attempt to identify them and to see if they are the missing bus passengers. Tamaulipas Gov. Egidio Torre Cantu condemned the violence, and said he would collaborate with federal authorities to locate and punish those responsible. ""These reprehensible acts underline the cowardice and the total lack of scruples of the criminal organizations, which generate violence in our country, and especially in the state of Tamaulipas,"" the office of Mexican President Felipe Calderon said in a statement. Read about a deadly four-day stretch in another part of Mexico . Amnesty International also called on Mexico to fully investigate, and it criticized the country's efforts to protect its citizens and migrants passing through. ""The mass graves found yesterday once again show the Mexican government's failure to deal with the country's public security crisis and reduce criminal violence which has left many populations vulnerable to attacks, abductions and killings,"" said Rupert Knox, a researcher on Mexico at Amnesty International. ""All too often such human rights crimes have gone unpunished, leaving criminal gangs and officials acting in collusion with them free to target vulnerable communities, such as irregular migrants."" The nationalities of the victims found in the mass graves were not immediately known. Tamaulipas is one of Mexico's most active states when it comes to drug trafficking activity. The Gulf cartel and the Zetas cartel both operate in the state and have strongholds there. The Zetas have been blamed for the killings of the 72 migrants who were found in San Fernando last year.","Authorities discover eight mass graves in northern Mexico .

"Rome (CNN) -- Authorities have in custody 34 people and are seeking the arrest of seven more as part of another major crackdown on the 'Ndrangheta crime syndicate, a prosecutor said Tuesday. The operation, dubbed ""Crime 2,"" follows a similar one in July 2010, appropriately named ""The Crime."" ""Crime 2"" seeks to apprehend 41 people in Italy, Germany, Canada and Australia on charges ranging from homicide and illegal weapons possession to drug smuggling and money laundering. Officials sought to arrest between 200 and 300 people during the 2010 operation. Of the 41 people sought, 34 are in custody, said Chief Prosecutor of Reggio Calabria Giuseppe Pignatone. ""The main information that emerged from this investigation is that the structure of the mafia organization called 'Ndrangheta, is united. The basic territorial unit of the 'Ndrangheta is reproduced abroad. Each unit refers for the solution of problems and for any main decision with the mother house in Italy,"" he said. Reggio Calabria is located in Calabria. The 'Ndrangheta is prevalent in the Calabria region of southern Italy and is seen as similar to the Sicilian Mafia. But the group has stretched to many other countries. In 2004, authorities said they linked the 'Ndrangheta to an international drug trafficking network involving gangs in South America and Australia.

"(CNN) -- Syrian security forces flooded the restive cities of Daraa and Latakia on Monday, patrolling the streets, protecting government buildings and in at least one case clashing with protesters, according to witnesses. Both cities have been the scene of violent clashes between protesters and security forces in recent days, with at least 37 deaths since last week, according to the U.N. Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights. In Daraa on Monday, forces filed into the city's main square before dawn, tearing down the tents and anti-government signs of about 100 protesters who were staying there overnight, according to one eyewitness. The forces fired shots into the air and turned water cannons on the protesters, the witness said, leading to a clash with hundreds of nearby residents who rushed to the square to defend the demonstrators. The resulting confrontation lasted about 30 minutes, reportedly without injuries or arrests, according to the witness. Another witness said the army was blocking the city on three sides and that security forces, surrounding government buildings and the Al-Omari mosque where some protesters remained, had opened fire. The witness was not aware of any injuries. Syria's state-run news agency said the government denied firing on protesters, calling the allegations ""completely false."" Political dissident Aman Aswad, who is in Daraa, said the city is extremely tense. ""People are sitting at home scared, watching the updates on TV,"" he said. In Latakia, another eyewitness said mysterious men in black shirts carrying sophisticated weapons terrorized residents overnight, firing into the air and banging on the doors of homes. ""We do not understand who these men are but government officials say they are members of a 'foreign group,'"" the witness said. ""We all think they are lying about this because every time one of them is captured and handed over to the police he is released."" Hundreds of government troops have also filtered into the Latakia and are guarding public buildings and other important sites, the witness said. CNN could not independently confirm the accounts because the Syrian government has yet to grant access to the network. Syria is the latest in a string of Arabic-speaking nations beset with discontent over economic and human rights issues. Syria's discontent is centered Daraa, a southern city in the impoverished country's agricultural region, where security forces and anti-government protesters have sporadically clashed for nearly two weeks. Thousands of protesters marched Friday to the governor's building in Daraa, where they burned pictures of President Bashar al-Assad and toppled a statue of his father, the late President Hafez al-Assad, according to a witness who identified himself only as Adbullah. Aswad, a political dissident, said dozens of people appeared to have been killed or wounded in clashes with security forces during those protests. In Latakia, government blamed ""armed gangs"" who seized police weapons on the violence last week that led to the deaths there of 10 security force members and civilians and two gunmen, according to the Syrian state-run news agency, SANA. The agency reported that 200 people, most of them security forces, were wounded by the gangs. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton criticized Syria's government over the violence on the CBS Sunday morning news show ""Face the Nation."" ""Certainly we deplore the violence in Syria,"" she said. ""We call as we have on all of these governments during this period of the Arab awakening, as some have called it, to be responding to their people's needs, not to engage in violence, permit peaceful protests and begin a process of economic and political reform.""

"As you would expect for a loyal caddie of 12 years, Steve Williams is backing Tiger Woods to bounce back from his slump in form as he prepares for the new season. Woods' annus horribilis was completed when he relinquished his world number one status to England's Lee Westwood in October after a record-breaking 281-weeks at the top. As the fall out from his divorce from ex-wife Elin Nordegren continued, Woods failed to win a single title and was even beaten to the tournament he hosts by U.S. Open winner Graeme McDowell last week. CNN blog: Can Tiger tame European charge in 2011? But after showing an upturn in form as the season neared its end, Woods' caddie Steve Williams is confident his man has what it takes to start winning again in 2011. ""Last week was the first time he's played three good rounds in succession this year,"" he was quoted as saying on New Zealand news website stuff.co.nz. ""It's been a difficult year and hard to focus on the task, but it's all started to come together so I'm excited for 2011."" Woods opted to remodel his swing after finishing tied fourth at The Masters in Augusta back in April and Williams says he knew then that the rest of the season would be a rebuilding process. Williams added: ""He's working on a new swing, and it takes time to be able to put that swing into play over an extended period. It's not easy to take it from the range to the course. He's just got more confidence with it."" But despite a rollercoaster year Williams says he has enjoyed the challenge of helping Woods to battle back to the top of the rankings. And he says motivation isn't a problem for either of them as they target a much improved year in 2011. ""Tiger wants to beat Jack's [Nicklaus] record, so that's what makes you work hard and get up early and train in the gym,"" Williams said. ""You only get four tournaments a year to get those wins, so it's an easy job to get motivated in.""","Tiger Woods' caddie Steve Williams says world number two will come good in 2011 .

"London (CNN) -- A Pakistani woman went on trial in London Monday, charged with keeping a woman from Tanzania as a slave. Saeeda Khan, 68, is accused of overseeing the visa and travel arrangements that brought Mwanahamisi Mruke, 45 from her home in Tanzania to London in October 2006. When Mruke arrived in London, prosecutor Caroline Haughey told the jury, she was expecting to work as Khan's housekeeper. In fact, the prosecution alleged, Khan treated her ""as a possession, not a person."" Mruke regularly worked 18-hour days, and would be summoned by the sound of a bell to attend to Khan. She was not allowed to leave the house, except to visit the supermarket or for medical appointments, and always accompanied by Khan, the prosecution said. In addition, the jury of nine women and three men was told, Khan kept Mruke's passport and would listen in on her phone calls back home. When Mruke's parents were dying, the jury heard, Khan forbade her to travel home, with the result that she did not get the chance to say goodbye to them before they died, nor did she get the opportunity to attend their funeral. The jury was shown pictures of what the prosecution said was a mattress and a single blanket, the bed on which Mruke was forced to sleep in the kitchen of Khan's three-bedroom house in Harrow, northwest London. The jury also heard that Khan had failed to honor an employment agreement relating to Mruke. That document - which, the prosecution said, Mruke had no recollection of signing - described two forms of payment to Mruke. The equivalent of 50 British pounds (about $81) would be paid monthly into a bank account in Tanzania, while Mruke would receive 10 pounds as an allowance in London. The court was told that the 10-pound allowance had ceased to be paid during Mruke's first year in the UK, and that the payment into the Tanzanian bank account had stopped after two years. Towards the end of the morning session, Mruke appeared as the trial's first witness. She sat behind a screen, hidden from the defendant, who was sitting in the main part of the court, rather than in the dock, because she suffers from arthritis. But Mruke did not testify live on Monday. Instead, the prosecution showed a video of police interviewing her. Saeeda Khan denies the charge against her. The trial is expected to last five days.","A Pakistani-born woman is accused of keeping a slave in the United Kingdom .

"(CNN) -- Germany and the United Kingdom are pulling nonessential embassy staff out of Yemen, they said Thursday, with the British citing ""the rapid deterioration in the security situation."" Both nations are keeping small core staffs in place in Sanaa, they said. Yemen, a key U.S. ally and a central battleground against al Qaeda, has been wracked by protests since the beginning of the year. Support for President Ali Abdullah Saleh appears to be slipping away. Saleh has accepted opposition demands for constitutional reforms and holding parliamentary elections by the end of the year, according to a statement issued by his office. The statement said Saleh was ""committed to undertaking all possible initiatives to reach a settlement"" with the opposition JMP bloc and ""prevent any future bloodshed of the Yemeni people."" According to the statement, Saleh ""has accepted the five points submitted by the JMP, including formation of a government of national unity and a national committee to draft a new constitution, drafting a new electoral law, and holding a constitutional referendum, parliamentary elections and a presidential vote by the end of the year. Saleh's aim would be to ""end the current state of political turmoil facing the nation and paving the way for a smooth, peaceful and democratic transition,"" the statement said. There was no immediate reaction from the opposition, which previously has demanded Saleh's immediate resignation. On Tuesday, a JMP spokesman rejected a report that Saleh was offering to step down by early 2012. ""Any offer that does not include the president's immediate resignation is rejected,"" JMP spokesman Mohammed Qahtan said. Saleh's statement came on the same day that Yemen's parliament approved a 30-day extension of emergency powers he declared last week in response to the protests. The emergency law expands the government's powers of arrest, detention, and censorship. The president's standing has weakened after some government officials and military officers declared their support for the opposition Monday in the wake of a crackdown on protesters that left 52 people dead last week. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton called Wednesday for full political dialogue in Yemen involving all players to find a peaceful solution. ""The people of Yemen have the same rights as people anywhere, and we support dialogue as a path to a peaceful solution,"" Clinton said in Washington. Asked about putting any pressure on Saleh, Clinton said: ""We are certainly making our views known on both a regular and consistent basis, both publicly and privately."" Yemen's army repelled an attack Tuesday on a military position by al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, killing 12 militants and wounding five, a Yemeni official told CNN, citing sources at the Interior Ministry in Sanaa. The official, who spoke on condition of not being named because he is not authorized to talk to the media, said the attack occurred east of the city of Lawdar, in Abyan province in southwest Yemen. The violence against opposition demonstrators last week drew international condemnation. Rupert Colville of the United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights said Tuesday that the agency deplored the reported killings of protesters, including allegations of snipers shooting from rooftops. ""All such violations of human rights must indeed be investigated by independent and impartial mechanisms,"" Colville said in Geneva, Switzerland. U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates said Tuesday the United States was ""obviously concerned about the instability in Yemen. We consider al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, which is largely located in Yemen, to be perhaps the most dangerous of all the franchises of al Qaeda right now."" Radical American-born cleric Anwar al-Awlaki is believed to be hiding in the country. The cleric has been linked to terror plots including the attempt to bomb a Detroit-bound plane on Christmas Day 2009, and he corresponded separately with a British Airways employee about trying to smuggle explosives onto planes. Top American officials, including U.S. President Barack Obama's counter-terrorism chief, have traveled to Yemen to meet with Saleh. Leaked diplomatic cables suggest Saleh's government helped disguise strikes by U.S. unmanned drones on terror targets in Yemen by calling them Yemeni actions.

"Acapulco, Mexico (CNN) -- Pascal Clemens arrived in Acapulco 17 years ago. The native of Germany who owns a real estate company in the Mexican beach resort says he immediately fell in love with the place. His original plan was to move to New York, but he couldn't get enough of the sunny beaches, friendly people, cool breezes, and above all, the spectacular weather in Acapulco. ""It's not only good, it's excellent, it's outstanding, every day! Have you seen any rain here?,"" asks Clemens as he looks up to the deep blue sky standing by a sandy beach on a recent, pleasant morning. Temperatures in the mid to upper 80s Fahrenheit (about 30 Celsius), sunny skies, and cool breezes are among the main reasons why countless foreigners have made Acapulco their paradise for decades. Back in the 1950s, actor John Wayne owned the Hotel Los Flamingos, which was built on top of Acapulco's highest cliffs. Johnny Weissmuller, who played Tarzan in Hollywood films, spent the last four years of his life here and is buried in Acapulco. Latin pop sensation Luis Miguel lived here for many years as well. The Mexican beach resort is full of luxury homes overlooking the bays and mansions with private gardens. According to local officials, at least 3,000 foreigners including Americans, Canadians, and Europeans call Acapulco home. A recent wave of drug violence that has sent the murder rate soaring to more than 80 violent deaths per 100,000 people is keeping some tourists away, especially spring breakers who were no-shows this year. Acapulco, with a population of 1.2 million, had 1,010 violent deaths last year, according to the Acapulco morgue, marking a steady increase from previous years. But violence is apparently having only a minimal effect on the real estate market. ""Right now the market is down in terms of sales, but the prices have maintained, surprisingly stable,"" says Clemens, who owns a property management, realty, and villas rental company called Beachfront Acapulco. The current situation is mildly affecting the luxury rental market. A $1.6 million home with two pools and six bedrooms located in the luxurious Las Brisas residential area used to rent for about $1,000 a day. Now it's down to about $700. Natalie Farmer, a Canadian who owns a time-share condominium and has spent weeks here every year since she was a little girl, has kept coming with her family in children in spite of the violence. ""I've always felt safe here. You certainly don't go looking for trouble and you stay within the compound and go out in groups, you know? And I think it's safe,"" says Farmer. Mayor Manuel Anorve says government agencies are working hard to turn the tide of violence, increasing police and military presence. ""Acapulco is standing on its feet, and of course, the three levels of government are working together to solve these problems, but I will say it again, Acapulco is bigger than its problems,"" says Anorve. Twenty-two-year-old Shana Dewale, a native of Belgium, has spent spring breaks here since she was a toddler. ""I see more violence in my country, in Belgium, than I see here in Acapulco. I never saw anything here as a tourist. I love it. I come every year and it's the best vacation I have,"" says Dewale. Joyce Patterson, an American from California who teaches English at the Universidad Americana de Acapulco, has been living in Mexico for 42 years, 35 of them here. She says she's concerned about the violence, but is not about to pack her bags anytime soon. She explains her reasons the way a native would. ""There's a phrase that they use here it's called 'el embrujo costeno' ('the coastal spell'),"" Patterson says. ""Once you're here, you won't want to leave because we've got the beach, we've got the breeze. It's a beautiful place to live.""","The tourist mecca has seen its murder rate soar due to drug violence .

"(CNN) -- Leading Japanese golfers Ai Miyazoto, Mika Miyazoto and Momuku Ueda have joined forces in launching a website to aid the rescue effort in their native country following the recent earthquake and tsunami. Speaking ahead of this week's $1.7 million Kia Classic in California, the trio revealed they have created a fund-raising website for a relief organization to combat the devastation. All three players, who were in Japan when the disaster struck, have designed buttons with a Japanese logo which translates into: ""Never Give Up Japan"". They will be wearing the buttons on their caps during this week's LPGA event and have also distributed them to their fellow-players in an effort to promote the website further. Current world number one Yani Tseng wore one of the buttons at her press conference for the tournament. World number six, Ai Miyazoto told a news conference: ""My whole family lives in Okinawa which is way down south from Tokyo, so they are all safe. ""But I went to high school in Sendai City, so I know many people over there. I heard everyone is safe but some of my friends lost their houses and they stay together in a gymnasium,"" she added. World No.51 Ueda added:  ""I think all three of us had an idea of what we wanted to do to help. ""But the reason why all three of us got together is because by doing it together, we could have a bigger influence.""","Ai Miyazoto, Mika Miyazoto and Momuku Ueda launch a website to help Japan .

"(CNN) -- Riccardo Ricco has been suspended by his Dutch-based Vacansoleil cycling team amid claims that the Italian gave himself a blood transfusion. Ricco -- who only returned to the sport last March after being handed a 20-month ban for doping during the 2008 Tour de France -- was admitted to a hospital in Modena on Sunday. His father told reporters at the time that Ricco had been suffering from a high fever and suspected kidney failure. But Italian media claimed the 27-year-old had admitted to doctors that he had made himself ill by injecting contaminated blood. And now his team have issued an official statement, saying they have found enough proof of a doping infraction to suspend the rider with immediate effect. The statement said: ""Internal research results following the illness and rumors regarding Ricco have given the team sufficient reason to suspend the Italian with immediate effect."" It continued: ""Last Tuesday, the team started an urgent investigation following the hospitalisation of Riccardo Ricco. Three days later the results of this study brought the team to the conclusion that an immediate suspension of Ricco was required. ""The violation of internal regulations of the team and other indications justify this measure. The team cannot prejudge but emphasises that a zero-tolerance policy towards doping is practised."" Blood doping -- an action that increases the amount of red blood cells available to carry oxygen to the muscles -- has been a problem in cycling for a number of years, with disgraced 2006 Tour de France winner Floyd Landis admitting last year that he blood-doped during his career. Blood cells are not damaged by freezing, consequently a ""blood doper"" can remove blood from their body, safely store it, and re-inject it when increased aerobic capacity and stamina is needed. However, if the blood is stored incorrectly, it can become infected, resulting in severe illness if transfused. The practice of blood doping is banned by all official sporting governing bodies and Ricco now faces expulsion from competitive cycling if found guilty, as well as a possible jail sentence in a country where all forms of doping are classed as illegal. Ricco has yet to react to the claims surrounding his hospital stay.","Riccardo Ricco is suspended by his Dutch-based Vacansoleil cycling team .

"(CNN) -- In his Oscar-nominated role as Vincent Mancini in The Godfather: Part III, Andy Garcia played a ruthless, murderous mob boss with a violent temper. But this week the Hollywood star is doing his shooting on the golf course. And the Corleone family will have to accept that every score he brings in at the Pebble Beach National Pro-Am will go to charity. The Godfather, it appears, has gone legit. ""I love to golf,"" Garcia told CNN. ""I get out once a week and play with guys like Joe Pesci, Jack Nicholson and George Lopez. I just turn up and play with whoever's waiting to go. It's a great way of meeting people and being sociable."" The 54-year-old actor will be joining the likes of Bill Murray, Kevin Costner and Ray Romano at the tournament in California this week, which sees celebrities paired with professional golfers in the name of charity. Garcia has been a regular at the PGA Tour event since 1996, and the 11-handicapper wouldn't miss it. ""The Gods shine on that tournament. It's the absolute pinnacle of what you can experience as an amateur golfer,"" Garcia said. ""We play three courses, Spyglass, Monterey Peninsula and Pebble Beach. They all run along the ocean and the scenery is extraordinary. Then there's the atmosphere, which is pretty unique to golf. ""There's also a lot of amazing work done for charity. On Wednesday we have a five-hole scramble and whatever we win goes to the charity of our choice. Bill (Murray) and I won it one year."" The tournament has raised over $85 million for the Monterey Peninsula Foundation since it was launched by Hollywood legend Bob Hope in 1937 -- with the funds distributed as grants to non-profit organizations across America. For Garcia, the opportunity to play alongside the world's best golfers is considered an honor and a privilege. But that Godfather ambition still burns beneath the surface. ""Of course you want to be competitive,"" he said. ""Paul Stankowski and I won the tournament back in 1997 (best combined Pro-Am total). I think the golfing Gods touched us that year. ""It's also a great place to pick up tips. You're hitting balls out of a practice bunker and you've got all these guys around you who can help you out. You're on the tee and suddenly Phil Mickelson is hitting a drive right next to you."" Garcia's love affair with golf began in his childhood, inspired by the likes of Gary Player, Arnold Palmer and Lee Trevino. He remembers jumping the fence to steal a few holes in while the sprinklers were still running at a course near his Florida home. But the Cuban-born actor turned his attentions to other sports at high school, and it wasn't until his early 30s that he returned to give the game his full attention. ""I'm a member at Lakeside Golf Club in Burbank now, the course where Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, Bob Hope and guys like that used to play,"" he said. ""I try to play once a week. But when the days get lighter I'll sometimes get out for nine holes in the evenings too. I'd love to play more if I had the time. I'm still pretty inconsistent. One day I play well, the next I don't."" Garcia's film credits include The Untouchables, When a Man Loves a Woman and Ocean's 11, and he's made his name in Hollywood as one of the coolest cats in the business. But even A-List Hollywood superstars get nervous on the golf course. ""The acting experience helps you focus, and I'm used to the crowds, but I still get those jitters on the first tee at Pebble Beach,"" he said. ""I don't command a game of golf like I do a scene in a movie.""","Actor Andy Garcia will be among the celebrities at the Pebble Beach Pro-Am .

"(CNN) -- Asian football chief Mohammed Bin Hammam will be Sepp Blatter's only opponent in the forthcoming FIFA presidential elections, the sport's governing body confirmed on Monday. The 75-year-old Blatter, who has held office since 1998, will go head-to-head with the Qatari on June 1 in Zurich, Switzerland. Elias Figueroa, a former international defender for Chile, had intended to put himself forward for the role but announced last week there was not enough time for a credible campaign to be launched. American journalist Grant Wahl said earlier this year he was hoping to stand, but it was more a ploy to raise awareness about what he called the ""need for change"" at an organization which has earned $4.189 billion over the last four years than a realistic challenge to Blatter's supremacy. Marvelous Mourinho record falls -- but will it ever be beaten? Africa's Issa Hayatou was the last candidate to run against the Swiss when he was defeated in the 2002 ballot, which came after a campaign of accusations of financial mismanagement at FIFA. Bin Hammam, a FIFA executive committee member and president of the Asian Football Confederation, told CNN last month that the time had arrived for change in the organization after more than a decade under the stewardship of the Swiss. Blatter, who has been involved with FIFA since 1975, announced at a recent UEFA congress in Paris this will be his last term as president if he is elected for another four years at the helm. Blatter plans final term as Bin Hammam calls for change . The 61-year-old Bin Hammam became AFC chief in 2002 and has called for greater transparency among football's decision makers.

"(CNN) -- The launch of the first Google-backed Android tablets is drawing near. Flashing another sign of the new software's imminence, Google has posted an updated version of its development kit. This new set of tools for application developers works with the upcoming Android 3.0 operating system. Android was designed with smartphones in mind. Android 3.0, also called Honeycomb, is the first version from Google geared toward tablet computers. The first fruit of that work will come late in February, when Motorola releases the Xoom, which works on Verizon Wireless' network. Later, LG and T-Mobile USA will debut the G-Slate. Google's hardware partners have taken shots at molding Android to fit larger screens. For example, Samsung Electronics did so for its Galaxy Tab, a 7-inch touch-screen tablet. But these types of products have been criticized for taking baby steps, rather than creating a system tailored entirely for tablets. The Galaxy tablets have also struggled to attract many app makers willing to retool programs for the larger screens, despite Samsung selling a million of them in two months. Google is expected to have better luck with its official foray into tablets. Not long after releasing the Android 3.0 development kit, blogs and message boards devoted to Android apps were digging through documentation and beginning to experiment with code. The package provides a closer look at some of the tablet's primary apps. The Web browser looks like Google's Chrome computer program, with tabbed browsing abilities, and integrates tightly with that desktop software for synchronizing things like bookmarks. The camera app has a wheel on the side for toggling effects. To help developers build new apps, Google also details how the new Android handles multi-tasking and notifications. Google's developer information also goes in depth on how people will navigate on a tablet with no physical buttons -- using what's called a System Bar, a sliver displayed at the bottom for accessing the home screen and navigation controls, as well as an Action Bar at the top, which changes depending on the app being used. Developers have about a month to get apps ready to meet the demand that may come from the Xoom's anticipated release. But it's not just about software that works on bigger screens. App makers will be able to tap features not present in any other tablet or phone, such as the barometer sensor installed in Motorola's upcoming tablet.","The launch of the Xoom tablet from Motorola Mobility is scheduled for late February .

"(CNN)  -- World champion Jorge Lorenzo triumphed in his home MotoGP on Sunday after an incident-packed race at Jerez. It was a Spanish one-two with Dani Pedrosa finishing second for Honda with Ducati's Nicky Hayden completing the podium. But it proved a heartbreaking afternoon for Italy's Marco Simoncelli, who looked to be headed for his maiden MotoGP win on his Honda before sliding off in wet conditions when leading Lorenzo by three seconds. Pole sitter Casey Stoner, who won the opening round in Qatar, did not finish in a chaotic race as he fell victim to a mistake by his arch-rival Valentino Rossi, who started from 12th before joining the leading group. But the Ducati star, who had overtaken former teammate Lorenzo, tried to pass Stoner, but as he overtook on the inside he lost control of his bike, sending both of them off. ""Rossi came up the inside and wasn't able to stay on the bike and took me out,"" Stoner told the official MotoGP website. ""It was not the best day for us for sure, after such a good weekend.

Rossi was able to restart his bike, but Aussie Stoner was not so lucky and missed out on the points with Lorenzo taking over at the top of the standings after two rounds from Pedrosa. Rossi eventually finished fifth, taking advantage of spills for compatriot Simoncelli and American Ben Spies, who had passed Pedrosa for second but then ended in the gravel, losing 20 points. Colin Edwards was also set for the podium, but also went off to allow former world champion Hayden and fellow American Hayden the chance to claim that honor for Ducati for the first time.

"(CNN) -- Just days after a Boeing 737 flown by Southwest Airlines made an emergency landing with a hole in its fuselage, the Federal Aviation Administration said in a press release Monday that it will mandate operators of about 175 specific older Boeing 737s to conduct inspections for wear and tear. The FAA said the ""emergency directive"" it plans to issue on Tuesday would affect about 80 U.S.-registered 737-300s, 737-400s and 737-500s, mostly operated by Southwest. The remaining 95 or so aircraft are registered outside the United States. Each of the 175 or so planes in question have taken off and landed more than 30,000 times and will receive repetitive electromagnetic inspections at regular intervals for fatigue damage. In a separate statement, Boeing said it was working with the FAA, the National Transportation Safety Board and Southwest, and it was preparing a service bulletin to recommend lap joint inspections on certain 737 models. NTSB board member Robert Sumwalt said Monday that inspectors have visually checked lap joints in the past, but haven't used high-tech monitoring, because no one thought that part of the plane was susceptible to cracks. Moving forward, inspectors will test the joints with an electromagnetic process. The chairman on the U.S. Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation said in a statement that the American public wants answers to retain confidence in commercial air travel. ""As the details of this unusual incident unfold, we will get a better understanding of what caused the plane's fuselage to tear open,"" said Sen. Jay Rockefeller, D-West Virginia. ""I expect the FAA to be painstakingly diligent in reviewing the safety of all aircraft, and to conduct a careful investigation into what caused the cracks that have been discovered on the bodies of these planes."" Rockefeller took advantage of the occasion to renew his call for reauthorizing the FAA. ""The FAA reauthorization bill now headed to conference takes steps to strengthen the inspection process of passenger aircraft, and I hope we can move that bill quickly to a resolution,"" he said. After Southwest canceled about 600 flights over the weekend to accommodate inspections, the airline said it canceled another 70 flights on Monday. By 3:30 p.m. Monday, the company had checked out 67 of the 79 planes it had grounded for inspection. Southwest said 64 of the 737-300s were being returned to service, while inspectors had discovered subsurface cracks on three jets. Those three will remain out of service ""until Boeing recommends an appropriate repair,"" Southwest said. As planes are cleared, they will be put back into service, Southwest said. Inspections are expected to be completed by late Tuesday. The airline recommended that customers should check with the website SWA.com for the status of a particular flight or rebook a trip before heading to the airport. Eighteen minutes into Flight 812 from Phoenix to Sacramento, California, on Friday, a hole 5 feet long and 1 foot wide opened in the fuselage, causing the cabin to lose pressure, the NTSB said. One flight attendant received minor injuries, the agency said. The pilot initially planned to return to Phoenix, but he made an emergency landing at a military base in Yuma, Arizona, after flight attendants reported seeing blue sky through the jet's roof, the safety board's Robert Sumwalt told reporters. Some of the 118 passengers who were aboard the crippled Boeing 737 said they feared for their lives. ""We were in shock,"" passenger Debbie Downey said Saturday. ""We were in row 16, and my husband and I could see blue sky ... the wiring, the cabling. It actually was terrifying."" Greg Hansen said fellow passengers panicked and screamed as the sun shone through the cabin. ""Most people were just white knuckles, holding on to the arm rests,"" he said. The airline said it provided a full refund, an apology and two complimentary round-trip passes on the airline for future flights. In July 2009, another Southwest Airlines 737-300 made an emergency landing when cabin pressure dropped because of a football-size hole in the jet. That incident prompted the airline to inspect its entire fleet of 737-300s. Earlier that same year, the airline was fined $7.5 million by the FAA after the agency found that Southwest operated 46 of its Boeing 737s on nearly 60,000 flights without performing mandatory inspections for fatigue cracks in their fuselages. Sumwalt said the 737 used for Flight 812 had a maintenance check in March at Southwest's Dallas facility, and the jet had no outstanding maintenance issues at the time of the accident, with all its records ""positive, up to date, (and) with no discrepancies."" The plane's flight data recorders had no noteworthy information on them, Sumwalt said. CNN's Mike Ahlers, Ric Ward and Marnie Hunter contributed to this report .","NEW: Southwest Airlines says as of 3:30 p.m., it had inspected 67 of its 79 grounded jets .

"Abidjan, Ivory Coast (CNN) -- Ivory Coast's diplomatic squabble centered Wednesday on a siege laid to a posh waterfront hotel where the president-elect has been holed up under the protection of United Nations peacekeepers. The world body, meanwhile, said it would ask the Security Council to approve up to 2,000 more troops to help ensure the presidency for Alassane Ouattara, recognized as the rightful winner of the disputed election that sparked the current political crisis. Alain Le Roy, the under-secretary-general for U.N. peacekeeping, said after a Security Council briefing that he was worried ""we are facing more difficulties"" in Ivory Coast. As the political standoff continued, the top U.S. diplomat on Africa said Laurent Gbagbo, the defiant self-declared president, had ""stolen"" the vote that removed him from office. ""There is no question but that the election in the Ivory Coast was stolen by President Gbagbo and those around him,"" Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs Johnnie Carson told reporters Wednesday. Gbagbo's ""continued presence in office amounts to a theft of the election,"" Carson said. The United States and other countries have offered Gbagbo what they call a ""dignified exit,"" which could mean living and working in other countries, including the United States. Gbagbo, however, has ignored those offers and has refused to accept telephone calls from U.S. officials. Carson said Gbagbo has challenged democracy not only in Ivory Coast but also in the entire region. Gbagbo, appearing to be softening his stance, had agreed to remove a military blockade around Ouattara's headquarters, but had not done so by Wednesday afternoon. ""The promise has not been kept,""  Le Roy said. Alcide Djedje, Gbagbo's foreign minister, said Gbagbo justified the continued siege as ""a measure of security"" because 300 of Ouattara's soldiers within the hotel are heavily armed. This hotel is a short boat ride from Gbagbo's residence. Djedje said the armed soldiers also posed a danger to people living near the hotel. Gbagbo, said Djedje, is waiting for Ouattara to release the soldiers before pulling back the military. ""The information I have is that he will lift the blockade,"" said Kenyan Prime Minister Raila Odinga, the African Union envoy for the mediation effort. ""He called the head of the military in our presence and asked him to lift the embargo, and I'm assuming that has happened."" Odinga, who visited Abidjan earlier this week with a delegation representing West African states, said Gbagbo was open to a meeting with the president-elect. ""He (Gbagbo) does not want any conditions,"" Odinga said. ""He wants amnesty, he wants to  know he's safe if he chooses to stay. These are things that have to be discussed face-to-face."" In short, Odinga said, the disputed president is willing to negotiate unconditionally. ""But Ouattara is not willing to negotiate unless Gbagbo accepts that he's president,"" Odinga said. ""Ouattara is being difficult."" Ouattara has said he will ensure protection for Gbagbo if he concedes, Odinga said. Major organizations, including the Economic Community of West African States and the African Union, have declared Ouattara the winner of the November 28 presidential runoff vote. Gbagbo, the incumbent, considers himself the rightful winner, and has not budged amid international pressure on him to step down. Violence following Gbagbo's refusal to vacate office has left more than 170 people dead in Ivory Coast and disrupted life for residents in Abidjan, the country's commercial hub. West African states will oust Gbagbo using military force if the standoff continues, Odinga said. ""We made it very clear that the stand of the African Union and ECOWAS is that Ouattara is the legitimate president,"" he said. ""And in the absence of a peaceful settlement, military action will be pursued."" Odinga, who was named prime minister after an election dispute led to the formation of a coalition government in Kenya, said power-sharing will not be an option for the West African nation. ""It is dangerous,"" Odinga said. ""It was replicated in Kenya and Zimbabwe, and set a dangerous precedence ... because it tells losers that they can cling to power in the hopes that a power-sharing will be worked out."" A coalition government is not ""a healthy process,"" he said. ""Losers must agree to surrender power."" The United States will not consider a power- sharing agreement because the outcome of the election was clear, State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley said. ""No one disputes the results of the election besides President Gbagbo,"" Crowley told reporters. ""And we believe that for the future of democracy in Cote d'Ivoire and West Africa that he should step down. And that is why we continue to support diplomatic efforts to resolve that with the peaceful transfer of power to Mr. Ouattara."" Cote d'Ivoire is the French name for Ivory Coast, a former French colony. Gbagbo has demanded a recount, which mediators have said is not an option because the election documents have been in the custody of his supporters. Mediators will return to Ivory Coast in the near future, but a date has not been set, Odinga said. CNN's Whitney Hurst, Faith Karimi and Jill Dougherty and journalist Eric Agnero contributed to this report.","NEW: Top U.S. envoy says Laurent Gbagbo stole the vote .

"(CNN) -- Firefighters in Texas worked Monday to contain fast-moving wildfires that had destroyed at least 60 homes, burned more than 130,000 acres, and caused an accident that killed a 5-year-old child, state forestry officials said. The fires broke out about noon on Sunday, said Lewis Kearney, a spokesman for the forest service's Texas State Lone Star Incident Management Team. Officials believe many were started by power lines that fell from high winds. Since Sunday, forestry officials, who were called in to assist local fire departments, responded to 63 fires covering 132,854 acres, the Texas Forest Service said on its website. Most of the fires were across the Texas Panhandle, Kearney said. Potter County Sheriff Brian Thomas said a 61,000-acre fire in his county was ignited when a man cut pipe with a metal grinder in high wind Sunday. Austin Lynn Stephens, 52, was arrested and charged with criminal trespass because he was on private property when he was using the grinder. Firefighters battled blazes in a dozen other counties including a 35,000-acre fire in Matador West in Motley County, and a 21,000-acre fire in Andrews County. They also fought fires in the counties of Haskell, Tom Green, Randall, Howard, Midland, Scurry, Motley, Crockett, Mitchell and Eastland. Crews that worked through the night to douse the flames got a little help from the weather Monday. The wind that propelled the fires was somewhat calmer, although it was still breezy and parts of the area remained under a fire-weather watch. Kearney said Sunday's high winds made it difficult for firefighters to use aircraft to battle the blaze. Interstate 20 was shut down for several hours Sunday after heavy smoke from the fires limited visibility. Authorities in Midland County responded to numerous accidents along the highway, including an eight-vehicle crash in which a little girl died, according to Sgt. Pete Cordova. One wildfire destroyed a dog kennel near Amarillo, said Capt. Wes Hall of the Amarillo Fire Department. Authorities were trying to account Monday for the animals missing or dead after the fire tore through the Willow Creek Kennel. Firefighters were able to open cages to free at least some of the dogs before the flames overtook the facility. As many as 27 homes were destroyed in the area and ""the fire was on the kennel in a matter of minutes,"" employee Chance Smith said, adding he did not have an exact number of dogs lost. In the community of Matador, north of Lubbock, families could do nothing but watch as their homes burned to the ground. The Segovias hadn't been gone 20 minutes when they returned to a panic-stricken neighborhood and found they had lost everything they owned. ""To know everything you worked so hard for, it's all gone,"" a tearful Juan Segovia told CNN affiliate KCBD. He and his wife, Rosemary, stared in disbelief at the blaze. The family of seven is without a home, but grateful for what was not lost. ""I'm glad our family wasn't home when it happened,"" Rosemary Segovia said before falling into her husband's arms. ""That's all I care about is I have my family."" One firefighter sustained second-degree burns battling a blaze near Colorado City, where a nursing home had to be evacuated before the fast moving flames swept through. And a Potter County sheriff's deputy narrowly escaped the flames while searching homes after a mandatory evacuation was ordered for the Mesilla Park area. Deputy Kevin Parvin entered a home as the flames were bearing down on the neighborhood, Thomas said, and by the time he left the home, the smoke was so thick he couldn't find his patrol car. Parvin had left the car running, and he followed the sound of a squeaking engine belt to find it and radio for assistance, Thomas said. He was treated for minor smoke inhalation. No other injuries were reported. CNN's Dave Alsup contributed to this report .","Man accused of sparking one fire with a metal grinder .

"(CNN) -- Brazilian relatives of a 9-year-old boy, caught in an international custody battle with the child's father, will not file any further appeals after the Brazilian Supreme Court ruled against them, their attorney told CNN Wednesday. The family is just looking for a peaceful handover of Sean Goldman to his father, attorney Sergio Tostes said, and plan on starting dialogue to allow the transfer to happen immediately. The chief justice of the Brazilian Supreme Court ruled Tuesday in favor of David Goldman, who had been battling the family of the boy's deceased mother for custody. The ruling by Chief Justice Gilmar Mendes will reunite Sean with his father. Last week, a lower court unanimously upheld a decision ordering that Sean Goldman be returned to his father in New Jersey. David Goldman arrived in Rio de Janeiro to reunite with his son, but one Supreme Court justice issued a stay, ordering Sean to remain with his Brazilian relatives until the high court could consider the case. Mendes' decision lifted the stay. This week the U.S. State Department issued a passport to Sean, given to his father, so that he can travel back to the United States, spokesman Philip J. Crowley said Wednesday. ""Our embassy in Brasilia, our consulate in Rio de Janeiro, many people have been up through the night just to provide support to the Goldman family, to maintain contact with the Brazilian government ... as we, hopefully, come to the end of this process and look forward to the reuniting of Sean Goldman with his father, David,"" Crowley said. The regional court decreed the boy must be handed over by 9 a.m. (6 a.m. ET) on Thursday. ""Sean is very sad because it is not and has never been his desire [to return to the United States],"" his grandmother, Silvana Bianchi, told CNN. ""He got especially disappointed about not having the right to speak in his own country [about] what he wanted for himself ... They are sending the boy to the United States without the right to defend himself. Where is the Brazilian constitution?"" Bianchi was initially expected to appeal. But Tostes said Wednesday the family wants to act in the boy's best interest, and he was meeting with an intermediary to arrange the handover. He said he would like Bianchi to meet with David Goldman so she can tell him what Sean likes to eat, what he enjoys doing and other details. Asked whether she would accompany Sean on the flight to the United States, Bianchi would only say Tostes is negotiating what is best for the boy. Upon hearing the family would file no further appeals, Rep. Chris Smith, R-New Jersey, said, ""This is not good news. This is great news."" The custody battle began in 2004, when Goldman's wife, Bruna Bianchi, took their then-4-year-old son from their home in New Jersey to Rio de Janeiro for what was to have been a two-week vacation. She never returned, instead remarrying there and retaining custody of Sean. She died last year in childbirth. Goldman has argued that as the sole surviving parent, he should be granted custody. The Bianchi family maintained it would traumatize Sean to remove him from what has been his home for five years. The custody battle garnered much media attention and spilled over into the political arena as well. U.S. Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-New Jersey, had placed a hold on a trade bill that would have benefited Brazil to the tune of $2.75 billion, but he lifted it after the court's ruling, spokesman Caley Gray told CNN. The bill in question, which sailed through the Senate after the senator dropped the hold, provides export tariff relief to 130 countries, of which Brazil would be the fifth largest recipient, Gray said. Lautenberg's hold was designed to exert additional pressure on Brazilian authorities to abide by the court order to return Sean to his father, he said. Silvana Bianchi told CNN Wednesday it was ""very sad, a country that exchanges children for economic agreements."" While the chief justice was still studying the case, Brazilian Attorney General Luis Inacio Adams said the executive branch of Brazilian government sided with Goldman. ""Once we stop cooperating and start breaking our treaties and international obligations, Brazil risks the chance of not having its own requests in the matters regarding international judicial help granted, based on the principle of international reciprocity,"" Adams said Monday. ""Not releasing the minor into the custody of his father could bring sanctions against Brazil,"" he added. ""It could damage Brazil's image before the international community."" CNN's Mariano Castillo and Adam Reiss and journalist Luciani Gomes contributed to this report.","Boy's Brazilian grandmother: He is ""very sad"" to leave, ""disappointed"" not to have a say .

"(ArsTechnica) -- The latest mobile phone user survey from market research firm ChangeWave reveals similar levels of overall satisfaction between iPhone 4 users on Verizon versus those on AT&T. However, Verizon iPhone 4 users seem to suffer from dropped calls far less often than their AT&T peers, supporting early anecdotal evidence from Verizon iPhone users. ""In terms of overall satisfaction the two iPhones are virtually indistinguishable,"" according to ChangeWave vice president of research Paul Carton. In March, 82 percent of Verizon iPhone 4 users reported being very satisfied with the device, while 80 percent of AT&T iPhone users reported the same. Only two percent reported any dissatisfaction with the device on either carrier. Half of Verizon smartphone users mulling switch to iPhone . That doesn't mean users on Verizon don't see at least one significant benefit: fewer dropped calls. Verizon iPhone 4 users reported a dropped call rate of 1.8 percent. AT&T iPhone 4 users, in contrast, had a dropped call rate of 4.8 percent -- more than double that of Verizon iPhone 4 users. That difference isn't limited to iPhones, though. Comparing dropped call rates for all mobile users on all four carriers, Verizon users reported just 1.4 percent of calls were dropped unexpectedly, while AT&T users reported a 4.6 percent rate. T-Mobile and Sprint users reported rates of 2.3 percent and 2.7 percent respectively. 16% of AT&T customers ready to jump ship for Verizon iPhone . A look at ChangeWave's historical data suggests that AT&T is actually improving. At the height of the iPhone 4 release, AT&T users were reporting dropped call rates as high as 6 percent -- the highest rate recorded by ChangeWave's survey since tracking began in 2008. At the same time, however, Verizon has also been improving. The 1.4 percent rate is the lowest recorded since 2008. While our own testing didn't reveal much of a difference in dropped calls, ChangeWave's results jibe with the accepted dogma about using an iPhone on Verizon versus AT&T -- namely, that dropped calls were much less of a problem. If voice calls are a primary reason you use a smartphone, Verizon is likely to be a better choice if you don't want your calls to unexpectedly cut themselves short.

"(CNN Student News) -- February 15, 2011 . Download PDF maps related to today's show: . • Iran • Algeria • Tokyo, Japan . Transcript . THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED. CENTENNIAL HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS: This is for you, Carl! CARL AZUZ, CNN STUDENT NEWS ANCHOR: Gotta say thanks to the students at Centennial High School in Ellicott City, Maryland for that. As a former drummer, I can tell you were right on rhythm! I'm Carl Azuz. Today's commercial-free subjects include economics, social studies and health. Let's go ahead and get started. First Up: 2012 Budget . AZUZ: First up, economics, as President Obama presents his ideas for the federal government's 2012 budget. You or your family have to make budgets, looking at how much money you earn versus how much you spend. The government does the same thing, but with a lot more zeroes. In fact, this budget request from the president, which is just for 2012, is for $3.7 trillion; more money than most of us can even imagine. The goal of a budget is to make sure you don't spend more than you make. But that's exactly what the U.S. government is doing right now, which is why we have what's called a deficit. President Obama says his new budget will cut that deficit by $1 trillion over the next 10 years by making some pretty big cuts to a lot of government programs, and by making more money from increasing some taxes. But there are critics on both sides. Some Republicans argue that the president's proposed cuts won't do nearly enough, and some Democrats say that President Obama wants to cut too much. Another important thing to keep in mind. What the president released is a budget request. He doesn't actually decide on what the budget is. That's the job of Congress, and it can choose to accept, reject or modify the president's plan. Protests in Iran . AZUZ: Going global now, with headlines of political protests in two different countries. First, Iran, where tens of thousands of people marched through the capital yesterday. They were speaking out against the Iranian government. Security forces were out on the streets too. At times, they allowed the protesters to march, but there were also reports of fighting between police and protesters. This YouTube video shows tear gas being used to break up a protest. It's hard for CNN to verify some of the reports coming from Iran because the country makes it hard for journalists to cover these kinds of protests. And the Iranian government slowed down the internet in what seems like an attempt to limit how much information gets out. Algeria Unrest . AZUZ: The other country we're looking at where people are calling for change in their government is Algeria. This is a north African nation that's home to nearly 35 million people. As you can see from these pictures, protesters and security forces faced off against each other this past weekend. Yesterday, Algerian officials said they're going to lift a ""state of emergency"" that Algeria has been under since 1992. Some experts say that decision might be an attempt for Algeria to avoid uprisings like we've seen recently in Egypt and in Tunisia. I.D. Me . TOMEKA JONES, CNN STUDENT NEWS: See if you can I.D. Me! I'm an organic compound that works as a stimulant. I affect the body's nervous system, as well as the heart and kidneys. I have a bitter taste, but no odor. I'm caffeine, and having too much of me can make you anxious or irritable. Energy Drink Warning . AZUZ: It's the caffeine, plus the other stimulants in energy drinks, that can give young people health problems. This is according to new medical research on the risks of energy drinks. Caffeine, as you know, is a legal stimulant. It's just that large amounts of it can be dangerous. One study found that almost half of all caffeine overdoses back in 2007 happened in people younger than 19. So what are the risks? Well, caffeine -- too much of it -- can mess up your sleep patterns. It can increase your blood pressure, which can put a strain on your heart. And if you're on any medications, caffeine can interfere with them and cause additional problems. Symptoms of too much caffeine: nausea, dizziness, rapid heart rate and seizure. I wanna be clear we're not talking about sports drinks, like Gatorade or Powerade. Those can actually be good for you, helping hydrate you after a big game. You can distinguish energy drinks by their ingredients. Energy drinks might include caffeine, taurine and guarana, additional stimulants that can hit different people in different ways. Responding to this report, the American Beverage Association says a lot of drinks you can get have caffeine in them, and that ""young adults getting coffee from popular coffeehouses are getting twice as much caffeine as they would from a similar size energy drink."" Giffords' Recovery . AZUZ: U.S. Representative Gabrielle Giffords is talking to her brother-in-law. Might not sound like a major news story, but it is a huge step for Rep. Giffords, whom you see here. She was shot in the head last month during an attack in Arizona. Family members and officials say she is making incredible progress in her recovery. Part of that is her conversations with her brother-in-law Scott Kelly, an astronaut currently on board the international space station. Giffords' husband, Mark Kelly, is also an astronaut. He's scheduled to go into space in April. Shoutout . JOHN LISK, CNN STUDENT NEWS: Today's Shoutout goes out to Mr. Giorno's humanities class at Girard College Lower School in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania! What country has the world's fastest growing economy? You know what to do! Is it: A) China, B) Japan, C) the United States or D) Russia? You've got three seconds -- GO! China has the world's fastest growing economy. That's your answer and that's your Shoutout! The New #2 Economy . AZUZ: It's because of that growth that China has made a move in terms of the world's largest economies. China is now the second largest, behind only the U.S. What does that mean for the former number two, Japan? We're checking in with Kyung Lah, who explains how a move in the economic rankings means a change in power. (BEGIN VIDEO) KYUNG LAH, CNN CORRESPONDENT, TOKYO: Step into Laox electronics store and you can hear the shift of economic might in Asia. Chinese greets shoppers. Sales signs are in Chinese. Workers assist shoppers in Mandarin. What's odd: we're in downtown Tokyo. But the people with the purchasing power here are not the Japanese. You don't have to tell this electronics store about the economic power shift in Asia. It's something they've seen for quite some time. When it comes to the number of paying customers, they see about 200 Japanese a day. Compare that with the number of Chinese: 1,000 customers every single day. LIN DONG DONG, LAOX TRANSLATOR: I'm proud of China! LAH: ...says Lin Dong Dong, a Chinese immigrant who's risen with the fortunes of his home country. He works for Laox as a translator but plans to become a doctor. Today, he's helping out this Chinese tour group here in Tokyo to spend money. NOBUKAZU IINO, LAOX STORE MANAGER [TRANSLATED]: ""Japan was once like China,"" says Laox's store manager, referring to Japan's economic surge in the 1980s. ""It's China's turn now."" LAH: China has blazed ahead, expanding its manufacturing sector and domestic infrastructure. At this pace, Japan's government estimates China will overtake the U.S. economy in just 15 years. Japan, meanwhile, has been stuck in two decades of stagnation and deflation amid indecisive economic policymaking. It now faces a demographic tsunami: the world's fastest aging population, one of the lowest birthrates, and a debt-to-GDP ratio that's highest among developed nations. That may be a snapshot of economic might, but economists warn it's not so black and white. KIRBY DALEY, SR. STRATEGIST, NEWEDGE: Japan's demographic tsunami, as it was termed, is very real and is going to stunt growth in that country for years to come. They need to get that situation under control. But China also has a demographic tsunami of its own, to re-use that term, coming as well. UNIDENTIFIED CHINESE MALE [TRANSLATED]: ""I know we became the world's number two economy,"" says this Chinese shopper. ""But we still have very poor people and there's a gap between rich and poor. I hope China as a whole becomes a wealthy country like Japan."" KEIICHI YAMAMOTO, TOKYO RESIDENT [TRANSLATED]: ""I envy China's hungry spirit,"" says Keiichi Yamamoto, who says what's missing most in Japan is passion and drive. ""But I believe Japan still has potential. It'll come back again."" LAH: Two Asian powers adjusting to a new economic world order. Kyung Lah, CNN, Tokyo. (END VIDEO) Free Downloadable Maps .

Police are investigating and Swissnuclear could not be immediately reached for comment. Matthieu Buchs, spokesman of the Swiss Federal Office of Energy, confirmed that the approval process for three new nuclear power plants had been stopped because of the disaster in Japan. Safety standards will be reviewed in all existing nuclear power plants, he said. Buchs also said Switzerland derives 39.3% of its electricity from nuclear energy.

""It's just an amazing gift,"" said April Langstraat, a 65-year-old Selma, California, woman who waited on a transplant list for five years before Friday's surgery. Alan Langstraat, 62, wanted to give a kidney to his wife, but his organ was incompatible. Instead, his kidney was transplanted into another patient at California Pacific Medical Center Friday, while his wife received an organ from a stranger who agreed to the swap. ""It's a rare opportunity,"" Langstraat told CNN affiliate KTVU-TV before a surgeon removed one of his kidneys. The process was repeated five times Friday, with a live kidney going to someone who had a friend or relative willing to donate an organ that was not compatible for them but was a match for one of the others. This was the third five-way kidney swap done in the United States, hospital spokesman Kevin McCormick said Sunday. Computer software is becoming increasingly effective in making complex paired donation matches, he said. ""Every time we do one of these kidney paired donations, taking the patients off the waiting list, in a sense, it's another kidney available for somebody who doesn't have a living donor option,"" said Dr. Steve Katznelson, the medical director of California Pacific's kidney transplant program. Each recipient and donor agreed to guidelines to prevent ""a breakdown along the way,"" with a donor ""suddenly saying 'I changed my mind'"" after the surgeries for the first had started, McCormick said. ""Everyone was pretty much in the same boat,"" he said. The donors did not know which patient would get their kidneys before the surgery and no one would find out unless each person agreed later. The procedures, involving 50 doctors, nurses and support staff, began at 7:30 a.m. with the last patient rolling out of surgery 10 hours later, McCormick said. ""They're all doing well,"" he said Sunday. The transplant results are ""very promising,"" he said. For the Langstraat family, the paired donation advance has added importance for their future. April Langstraat's daughter Charlotte and son Henry inherited her genetic polycystic kidney disease, which means they expect to need transplants in the future. Although 83,000 people are on the U.S. waiting list for kidney transplants, the number of live kidney donors declined from 6,647 in 2004 to 6,387 in 2009, according to the National Kidney Foundation.","Computer software matches incompatible donors for five-way organ swap .

THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED. MR. KOCZOT'S CLASS, BROAD CREEK MIDDLE SCHOOL, NEWPORT, NORTH CAROLINA: We are students at Broad Creek Middle School in Newport, North Carolina and we are flying you in to CNN Student News! CARL AZUZ, CNN STUDENT NEWS ANCHOR: Thank you to Mr. Koczot's class for that exemplary introduction! My name is Carl Azuz, and today's top stories are right now! First Up: President Obama in India . AZUZ: An interesting headline came out of President Obama's third day in India: He was giving a speech to India's parliament, its government, and the U.S. president officially endorsed India getting a permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council. Okay, so what? Well, since 1945, the U.N. Security Council has had five permanent members. They include the U.S., the United Kingdom, France, China, and Russia. These five countries have had the ultimate power to veto any major move that the U.N. wants to make, so a permanent seat there is very powerful. CNN's Ali Velshi explains why President Obama wants India, to have one: . ALI VELSHI, CNN ANCHOR AND CHIEF BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: Why did President Obama bring it up? Well, the U.S. sees a huge potential upside to a powerful India in terms of democracy. President Obama sees India's system as a model for developing countries. And then there's the economy. We've discussed this. India is booming, creating more and richer consumers every year. And, finally, there's the issue of security. India is involved in Afghanistan, is joining the cause for nuclear nonproliferation. As for Pakistan, America's ties with that country do complicate its ties with India because those two are arch rivals. But that, too, was part of the president's address. AZUZ: Besides Pakistan, though, China also sees India as a rival and doesn't want India permanently on the Security Council. And Japan has been trying to get a permanent U.N. seat since the early 1990s. So while the president's statement was welcomed in India, action isn't expected anytime soon -- if ever. Cargo Embargo . AZUZ: No air cargo from Yemen will be allowed into the United States anytime soon. The Department of Homeland Security is also saying ""no"" to any air cargo from the African country of Somalia. And no airline passengers can travel with large printer cartridges. These new rules are in effect immediately, and here is the reason: An apparent terrorist plot involving two package bombs. They were discovered in late October on air cargo shipments from Yemen to the U.S. Is This Legit? CNN STUDENT NEWS: Is This Legit? The disease cholera is caused by a virus. This is false; cholera is caused by a bacterial infection. Unhealthy Living Conditions . AZUZ: That means that cholera can be treated with antibiotics if needed. And in most cases, it is an easily curable disease: The World Health Organization says proper treatment can keep the number of people who die from cholera to less than one percent. The problem in Haiti is, there's not a lot of proper treatment. Cholera can spread where drinking water and conditions are generally dirty. That's exactly what Paula Newton saw in Haiti's capital. (BEGIN VIDEO) PAULA NEWTON, CNN CORRESPONDENT: There is no delicate way to put this, Port au Prince looks and smells like a dump, because it is. Ten months after the earthquake, the city has degenerated into a filthy cauldron of water, garbage and human waste. The garbage situation has always been a problem here, but now no one pays any attention to where they dump it and the government makes virtually no effort to pick it up. Don't you think that Haitians deserve better than this? UNIDENTIFIED HAITIAN MALE: We get used to it. Everybody who grew up in this country are used to it. NEWTON: But the stakes are higher now. As cholera stalks the city, these are the conditions that so worry health experts. Just look, Haitians desperate for water, collect it from a pipe right next to a burning collection of waste. The city is like an open garbage pit, this is a central canal that cuts right through the middle of the city and garbage of all descriptions flows right through it. And this is where it ends up, right down the canal and piled up. Tons of garbage just laying waste here in the canal that no one ever seems capable of collecting. With cholera now a reality in Haiti, this is not just a matter of aesthetics or hygiene, it may soon become a matter of life and death. (END VIDEO) Drowsy Drivers . AZUZ:  Okay, our next story today: You know distracted driving -- texting, eating, makeup -- is a dangerous problem. You're not gonna believe this: In a survey taken by AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety, two out of every five drivers -- this is 40 percent we're talking about -- say they've fallen asleep while driving!  And in the previous month, more than 25 percent of drivers surveyed said they had trouble keeping their eyes open on the road. And this isn't just quick dozing without consequences. Researchers figure that drowsy driving is a factor in one of every eight crashes that send someone to the hospital. The head of the AAA Foundation says people are just underestimating how tired they are and overestimating how well they can deal with it while driving. Shoutout . CNN STUDENT NEWS: Today's Shoutout goes out to Ms. Wheeler's social studies and science classes at Tomahawk Creek Middle School in Midlothian, Virginia! Which of these observances was previously known as Armistice Day? Is it: A) Memorial Day, B) Arbor Day, C) Flag Day, or D) Veterans Day? You've got three seconds -- GO! The U.S. Congress established Armistice Day in 1921; the name was changed to Veterans Day in 1954. That's your answer and that's your Shoutout! Helping Veterans Cope . AZUZ: So while it started as a way to honor those who served in World War I, Veterans Day is now a tribute to everyone who's served in the military. A man and some mammals in Florida, are working together to help America's veterans. Those who return home with ""post traumatic stress disorder"" sometimes feel intense anxiety, long after the ordeal of combat. Meet the ones who are offering helping hands and fins. (BEGIN VIDEO) MANDY RODRIGUEZ, U.S. MARINE CORPS VETERAN: Come on, lets go out to the dock. Come on up. Who wants to play? There you go. So this is not a bad way to spend the rest of your life; watching these wonderful animals, learning from them. My name is Mandy Rodriguez and I served in Vietnam. When I joined the Marine Corp, I was a teenager. And um, I was, I went through my training. And was sent to Vietnam almost immediately, like the rest of us. I make the best friends ever in um, in um Vietnam. And I've also seen some of the most horrific things I've ever seen in my life. Which, unfortunately, still stick with me. After coming back from Vietnam as a young Marine, I was very confused, very angry. Probably just like all of us out of war. And these animals helped me. They actually saved my life, if you want to say. They're just a wonderful way, their happiness, the way they look at you, the way they treat you. Uh, and it carries through. And I actually used that with other humans, and guess what? It works! I'm Mandy Rodriguez, nice to meet you. We figured that maybe this would be a good way to help these veterans. Ready Marine? That a girl, there she comes, she's sizing you up. Now there you go, now look this way, big smile. Do you feel the vibration? We developed the program to help the men and women who are coming back from Afghanistan and Iraq. These are heroes and these people deserve our accolades, deserve our applause. For that one half hour of time they probably would have forgotten all those things that they have gone through in their war. Can you kiss Johnny goodbye, please? They have that ability to put you in a world where you're accepted. To put you in a world where it's a good world and not, you're not thinking about those things, those traumatic things that you've experienced in the past. (END VIDEO) Blog Promo .

"(WIRED) -- As Sly Stone said, the nicer the nice, the higher the price.The question is, is the more expensive Xoom nicer than the comparable iPad? The experience is markedly different, that's for sure. Anyone familiar with Apple's market-leading tablet -- and the Xoom invites the comparison -- will face a few moments of disorientation when picking up the Xoom for the first time. A few details are unsettling to iPad users, such as the location of the power button (on the rear of the device), the lack of front-facing command buttons, and the unfamiliar location of the volume rocker. Those details will be irrelevant to non-Apple users, of course, but even dedicated Android fans will find that the Xoom's version of the OS, Android 3.0 Honeycomb, takes a bit of getting used to. Some things don't work the same as they do on older versions of Android. For instance, instead of holding down the (virtual) ""home"" button to see a list of running apps, there's now a separate icon for displaying a vertical menu of apps. To see the full list of installed apps, you press a separate ""apps"" button in the upper right of the screen. And while the lack of front hardware buttons gives the device a cleaner look, it does mean that virtual buttons clutter up the display and rob you of screen space in most applications. It's a tradeoff. But once you've oriented yourself to Honeycomb's and Xoom's idiosyncracies, what emerges is a tablet that's very well suited to reading and to video. The Xoom has a 10.1-inch screen (measuring 8.5 by 5.25 inches), and it's as bright and sharp as any other high-end tablet. We did notice a slightly discolored band running down the edge of the screen on one side, but since we can't compare it to other Xooms yet, we don't know if this is a problem with our review unit or a more general manufacturing defect. The 1280×800 screen is pretty close to a standard widescreen aspect ratio, so videos can fill the whole screen with minimal clipping. The Xoom is a little bit shorter than the iPad in landscape mode, but that means that when you flip the Xoom to portrait mode, the screen is skinnier and taller. This is actually perfect for reading books, scrolling down web pages, or catching up on Instapaper. It's comfortable to hold the Xoom with one hand while you swipe with the other, and because the vertical page is so tall, there's less swiping than on smaller screens. WIRED: Read more about iPad's FX Photo Studio . The rubbery back panel has enough grip that you don't really need to clamp onto the thing while you're reading. If you feel fatigued by holding your iPad one-handed for long periods of time like I do, you'll appreciate this. In short, it's an excellent, basic media consumption device -- as long as your media doesn't rely on stellar audio. If you're planning on zoning out with a movie or a few videos, we'd recommend keeping a decent pair of headphones on hand. The big problem with the sound? The speakers are in the back of the tablet. They sound fine if you turn the tablet around to face the speakers toward you, but if you're holding the Xoom so you can see its screen, the sound is projecting away from your head. Everything sounds muffled: movie dialog is harder to understand and music just sounds dead and lifeless. There's an optional dock with speakers built in, but when you plop the Xoom into the dock to watch a movie, the dock speakers sit behind the tablet, too. So it's the same problem all over again, just a little louder. The Xoom has two cameras: A front-facing, 2-megapixel camera is meant for video conferencing and webcam chats, while a rear-facing, 5-megapixel camera is meant for shooting still photos and video. Taking pictures with it feels funny. It's the same as snapping a picture your phone, except the thing you're holding is four times the size. On the other hand, being able to compose a photo while looking at something bigger than a 5×7 print is a real luxury, as it lets you see details you wouldn't otherwise notice on a small phone screen or camera viewfinder. It's awkward, but we suspect it will become commonplace within a few months now that every tablet is getting a camera built into the back. With an $800 entry price (or $600 if you're willing to commit to a two-year Verizon data contract at $20 per month), the Xoom is a bigger leap of faith than Apple's market-leading tablet. Granted, the most comparable iPad -- the one with 32GB of storage and a 3G wireless connection -- costs $730, making it just $70 cheaper than the un-subsidized Xoom. But if you want to sample the iPad, a 16GB Wi-Fi only version is available for $500, and so far Motorola has announced nothing in a comparable price range for the Xoom. For that reason we think fewer people are likely to jump on the Xoom bandwagon. Those who do will be attracted by the widescreen format, the ability to buy apps without going through Apple's restrictive App Store. For those who want a more fully-finished, polished experience, however, we recommend waiting for a future Android tablet -- or the iPad. The Xoom is a credible contender, but it's not quite on par with the market leader yet. WIRED . Big, widescreen display offers plenty of room for video and for reading. Fast 1-GHz processor promises great performance for future games and apps. Honeycomb simplifies and optimizes the Android interface for tablets. Dual cameras and an optional external keyboard make this a credible notebook (or at least netbook) replacement. TIRED . Rear-facing speakers don't do justice to any kind of audio. The button thing is weird. Honeycomb seems to have some bugs to work out. No support for Adobe Flash-based content. Subscribe to WIRED magazine for less than $1 an issue and get a FREE GIFT!

"(CNN) -- Emmanuel Adebayor scored a header in each half, while Angel Di Maria and Cristiano Ronaldo added further goals, as Real Madrid overpowered 10-man Tottenham 4-0 in the first leg of their Champions League quarterfinal at the Bernabeu. Real boss Jose Mourinho is attempting to become the first coach in history to win three Champions League titles with three different clubs, and he remains on course to achieve that feat after this comfortable victory. The home side had the perfect start when they took the lead in the fourth minute -- Adebayor climbing above the Spurs defense to head home a Mesut Ozil corner, with goalkeeper Heurelho Gomes and Luka Modric getting in each other's way as they attempted to clear the ball on the goalline. Tottenham's task was made even harder when England forward Peter Crouch was sent off in the 15th minute. Booked early on for a sliding tackle, Crouch committed an almost identical foul on Marcelo to receive a second yellow card to leave the visitors with a mountain to climb. And Real made Tottenham pay for Crouch's indiscipline with a second goal 11 minutes after the break, Adebayor converting another header from Marcelo's left-wing cross. It continued former Arsenal striker Adebayor's superb scoring record against Tottenham, with the Togo international having now netted 10 goals in 10 games against Spurs. Adebayor almost made it a hat-trick of headed goals in the 66th minute when he rose at the far post to meet Lassana Diarra's cross, but Gomes did superbly to parry the ball over the crossbar. But, by now, the home side were piling on the pressure and they scored the goal of the night in the 72nd minute with Di Maria curled a delightful left-foot shot into the top corner. And Real added a fourth with three minutes remaining when Ronaldo, who had been doubtful to start the match because of injury, scored from an acute angle, although his weak shot appeared to go straight through Gomes. The result means Real Madrid now have one foot in the semifinals and a potential last four encounter with bitter rivals Barcelona in what could be one of the most anticipated pair of matches in European football history.","Real Madrid overpower 10-man Tottenham 4-0 in Champions League quarterfinal .

"Tobruk, Libya (CNN) -- Like everyone else, Aisha Ahmad watched the riveting drama unfold in a Tripoli hotel as a desperate woman burst into a dining room filled with journalists, sobbing, screaming, wanting the world to know she had been raped by 15 of Moammar Gadhafi's militia men. The arresting images of how swiftly the woman, Eman al-Obeidy, 29, and the journalists were stifled stirred viewers around the world. But perhaps none more so than Ahmad. This was her daughter. And she was enraged. Just weeks before, Ahmad might have wept in silence. But now, with war engulfing Libya and its future hanging in the balance, Ahmad feared Gadhafi no more. ""If I were to see his face, I would strangle him,"" she told CNN in an interview at her modest home in the eastern coastal city of Tobruk. This is where she raised her 10 children with her husband, a retired customs agent. As a little girl, al-Obeidy looked out over the deep blue waters of the Mediterranean, calling on the oil tankers to carry her away to France. She loved languages, most of all French. Ahmad recalled her daughter wanting always to be a journalist, but, discouraged by the lack of press freedoms under Gadhafi, she opted instead to study law in Tripoli and make a better life. She was living with her sister when she was, as she claimed, held against her will for two days, beaten and raped. Ahmad said she believes her daughter's every word, despite attempts by the Gadhafi regime to discredit her. The Libyan government first said al-Obeidy was mentally ill and drunk. They called her a prostitute. Later, it changed its story and said al-Obeidy was sane enough to withstand legal proceedings. Libyan government spokesman Moussa Ibrahim said the men accused of raping al-Obeidy are being investigated, but the suspects, in turn, have filed counter-charges for slander. The attempt to discredit al-Obeidy as a promiscuous, un-Islamic woman ties into the idea of sexual shaming in a conservative Muslim society where it's commonly believed that a woman who has been raped has lost her honor, said Mona Eltahawy, a columnist on Arab and Muslim issues. For a woman in such a society to come forward to claim she has been raped is no small thing. ""No one would do that unless they were raped, and especially in a conservative society,"" Eltawhy told CNN. Al-Obeidy's act ended up being as significant as the discontented fruit vendor in Tunisia who set himself afire and sparked revolt in the entire region, Eltawhy said. The way al-Obeidy spoke out was unprecedented and she has already been hailed a hero on social networking sites. Ahmad said she received a call Sunday from a man who offered her a bribe to reject al-Obeidy's claims and persuade her daughter to change her tale. Ahmad refused. She stands by her daughter, she said. So does her entire family and tribe. To show their support, the family held an in-absentia engagement ceremony for al-Obeidy at a mosque in Tobruk Monday. No one here thinks she has lost her honor. The government said al-Obeidy was freed but she has not been seen publicly since she was dragged away by security men and bundled into a waiting white car outside the Rixos Hotel Saturday. Ahmad has not heard from her daughter and challenged Gadhafi to air video of her on state television as proof of her well-being. Ahmad said she was also worried about her other daughter. No one has apparently seen her either since Saturday. A group of lawyers and human rights activists tried to approach al-Obeidy's sister's house Monday, but were blocked by security forces. The sister's mobile phone has apparently been turned off, a source with the opposition in Tripoli told CNN. Al-Obeidy's story raced around the world after she stormed into the Rixos Hotel as international journalists were having breakfast Saturday morning. Her face was bruised. So were her legs. She showed reporters blood on her right inner thigh. She said she had been held against her will for two days and raped by 15 men. Her visible injuries appeared to support her claims, but CNN could not independently verify al-Obeidy's story. ""Look at what Gadhafi's brigades did to me,"" she said. ""My honor was violated by them."" Al-Obeidy displayed what appeared to be rope burns on her wrists and ankles. Government officials tried to subdue her, but she persisted. Even a member of the hotel's kitchen staff drew a knife. ""Traitor!"" he shouted. Another staffer tried to throw a dark tablecloth over her head. One government official, who was there to facilitate access for journalists, pulled a pistol from his belt. Others scuffled with reporters and wrestled them to the ground in an attempt to take away their equipment. Some journalists were beaten and kicked. CNN's camera was confiscated and smashed beyond repair. As security forces dragged her away, al-Obeidy warned: ""If you don't see me tomorrow, then that's it."" Ahmad said she has not been able to stop crying. She hasn't slept or eaten. She sees only her daughter's distress shared so publicly at a pivotal moment of her nation's history. CNN's Nic Robertson and Khalil Abdallah contributed to this report .","Eman al-Obeidy's mother says she could strangle Gadhafi for her daughter's mistreatment .

"Denver, Colorado (CNN) -- A charter flight carrying family members of U.S. military service members serving in Japan landed Thursday on U.S. soil in Denver. The flight contained 144 people who voluntarily left Japan in the wake of the catastrophic earthquake and tsunami and ongoing concerns about the crippled Fukushima Daichi nuclear power plant. Weary from a 14-hour journey,  the families and 18 pets filed into a hangar converted into a welcome center. Representatives from all four branches of the military and Red Cross volunteers were on hand to give them food and water and help get them to their final destinations around the country. About half of the passengers were children who immediately set about playing in a dragon-shaped ""moonbounce"" and by tossing footballs around with the service members on hand to help. One of the parents was Airman 1st Class Megan Pencook of the Air Force, clutching her 5-week-old son, Adrian. Pencook is stationed at Yokota Air base near Tokyo. She was holding her son when the earthquake hit. ""I felt huge shaking. I was feeding my son and just holding him to me and trying to remember what earthquake safety was. I was shaking so bad,"" Pencook said. ""It was the scariest experience of my life."" The child¹s father is an Air Force airman serving in Korea. He wanted them to leave riight after the earthquake, but Pencook wanted to stay in Japan, a country she has grown to love. ""Then I heard of radiation positioning in the water in Tokyo and I said, 'It's time to go,"" she said. When she landed in Denver there were service members on hand to help her with Adrian and make sure she had whatever she might need. ""It feels so good to know that in a crisis, your military family is there for you,"" she said. The chartered Delta jet first touched down in Seattle where all aboard were screened for radiation. ""Every international flight is monitored and there have been no significant amounts of radiation,"" said Army Col. Marc Hutson. As the afternoon wore on, the hangar resembled a children's birthday party as much as a military operation. Footballs flying, moon-bouncers bouncing and dogs chasing each other. Hutson took in the scene with a smile. ""It's awesome. These are our families; this could be my family coming back. Morale is high,"" he said.","A charter flight brings 144 Americans home from Japan .

"(CNN) -- A brutal, fatal case of suspected cruelty to animals is under investigation in Louisiana, the state's wildlife department said in a press release Tuesday. The animal cruelty doesn't involve the typical household pet. This time, the United States' national bird was victimized. Agents from the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries found a beheaded bald eagle Sunday in a drainage ditch in Franklin Parish, in the northeastern part of the state, according to the release. ""To see any protected animal decapitated in a ditch is disheartening enough, let alone the animal that represents our symbol of freedom,"" said Capt. Alan Bankston of the wildlife department. The agents believe the bird had been dead for a couple of days before it was found. Wildlife and Fisheries spokesman Adam Einck said the eagle was found in a very remote location, and agents are unsure if the bird was killed there, or slain somewhere else and dumped there. Agents are trying to schedule a necropsy to determine how the eagle died, Einck said. Bald eagles are protected by the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act and the Migratory Bird Treaty Act. Anyone who is convicted of violating those acts could be fined $5,000 and jailed for up to 18 months for each count, the state wildlife department said. Bankston urged the public to call the department with any information about the beheading. Anyone providing information leading to an arrest or conviction would be eligible for up to $2,000 in cash rewards. The agency's hotline number is 1-800-442-2511.","A bald eagle with its head cut off is found in a drainage ditch in northeastern Louisiana .

"Djerba, Tunisia (CNN) -- The evacuation of the tens of thousands of refugees who have streamed across the Libyan border to Tunisia has stepped up dramatically. Tunisian authorities have established an air bridge from a provincial airport on the island of Djerba that is now moving out thousands of migrants a day. ""We are expecting 10,000 passengers to leave every day with 66 movements, that's to say 66 planes,"" said Djerba airport director Zouhaier Badreddine told CNN. ""The majority go to Egypt. But there are also Chinese, Pakistanis, Filipinos, Bangladeshi, Vietnamese, Turks in the beginning but now they all seem to have left. There are many nationalities and many destinations."" As of Thursday, more than 172,000 people had left Libya, most of them migrant workers returning home, the U.N.'s emergency relief coordinator, Valerie Amos, said in a statement issued Friday. Among them were women and children, she said. The United Nations' figure was slightly less than that of the International Organization for Migration, which has been working with the U.N. refugee agency and estimated that 200,000 people had fled Libya. Some of those crossing the border told CNN that government forces in Tripoli had confiscated their mobile phones and cameras. A majority of those fleeing are Egyptians who had been working in Libya. But the foreign workers also include citizens of other nations including Bangladesh, Thailand, Vietnam, Sudan, Ghana and Mali. A U.S. Agency for International Development official said approximately 90,000 people were in transit camps over the Libyan border in Tunisia. Almost half of them are Egyptian, said the official, who did not want to be identified because he was not authorized to speak on the record. Closer to the Egyptian border, in the eastern city of Benghazi, about 8,000 foreigners awaited evacuation. They included Eritreans, Ethiopians and Somalis, according to the refugee agency. ""They appear to have gathered spontaneously and are camping together for security as they await,"" refugee agency spokeswoman Melissa Fleming said in a statement. She said most of those people will be evacuated within two days. Another 110,000 people inside Libya have been affected by the crisis, the International Committee of the Red Cross said Friday. It appealed for $26 million to help those inside the country and those in Tunisia. The agency said it will use the money for food, water, medical care, sanitation and hygiene items. As the violence has escalated in the past few days, U.S. military aircraft and French charter jets have scrambled to evacuate tens of thousands from the north African nation. In Washington, President Barack Obama said he has approved the use of U.S. military aircraft to help Egyptians who have fled the unrest to return home. He said he authorized the U.S. Agency for International Development to charter additional planes. ""Tens of thousands of people from many different countries are fleeing Libya, and we commend the governments of Tunisia and Egypt for their response, even as they go through their own political transitions,"" Obama said. The Pentagon announced that two planes carrying humanitarian supplies were being dispatched Friday to Tunisia in what has been dubbed Operation Odyssey Dawn; the planes were carrying blankets, rolls of sheeting and water cans. CNN learned that a C-130 cargo plane labeled with a U.S. flag landed in Tunisia. Badreddine stood in the departure hall of an airport that normally welcomes sun-hungry European tourists traveling to the wind-swept beaches of Djerba's Mediterranean coast. Instead, the hall was filled with hundreds of tired and dirty migrant workers. Some camped out on the floor on blankets. Others stood in orderly lines in front of a booth normally reserved for car rental companies and money exchange, which instead held Tunisian volunteers distributing sandwiches, fruit and water to the arrivals. ""Of the 50,000 refugees who have come through here"" since the crisis began, Badreddine said, ""everybody has been given shelter and food at the airport."" The conditions at the airport were dramatically better than the scene that awaited many migrants immediately after entering Tunisia from Libya. On Thursday, more than 5,000 Bangladeshi men were camped out in a vacant lot next to the border gate, huddled under blankets next to a fetid pond of muddy water as howling winds whipped dust through the compound. Tunisian authorities and volunteers distributed food and water. A tent city that serves as a transit center was erected this week some 10 kilometers from the border. But the camp can hold only some 15,000 people -- that's how many people are estimated to have arrived in a single day and not near enough to accommodate all those in need. Still, conditions have improved dramatically since Wednesday, when Libyan authorities began regulating the flow of refugees across the border. Instead of allowing them to mass by the thousands in front of the Tunisian border gate, refugees must now approach the border with Tunisia in orderly groups in single file. The U.N. refugee agency said Friday that the number of civilians fleeing the violence in Libya to Tunisia ""has dropped significantly since Wednesday afternoon,"" with armed, pro-government forces manning the Libyan side. Compared with earlier in the week, when 10,000 to 15,000 people were crossing daily into Tunisia, fewer than 2,000 made it across on Thursday and about the same number did so on Friday, the agency said. The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees said it was ""very concerned that the security situation in Libya may be preventing people from fleeing."" The Libyan government appeared eager to show off the orderly border. Officials bused in a group of foreign journalists from Tripoli Thursday afternoon as part of a guided tour of the frontier region. But, upon their arrival in Egypt, dozens of refugees have said they had been robbed at Libyan checkpoints. Many said that, as they sought to get out of Libya, they were stopped and searched by Libyan security forces who confiscated their cell phones and computers. Many refugees also accused Libyan police and soldiers of having robbed them at gunpoint. ""I have no passport, only a passport photocopy,"" said Mohammed Shafiq al Islam. The 29-year-old man sat on the floor of the airport with more than 100 Bangladeshis -- all of them awaiting a flight home. He wore a uniform labeled ""Hanil,"" the name of the supply company that paid him $250 a month to work in Libya. ""The Libyan people take my money and passport and all the time say 'I will kill you, I will kill you,'"" al Islam said, speaking in broken English. ""I am run away (for) my life."" Like many Bangladeshi migrant workers, al Islam had borrowed some $4,000 to pay employment agencies to give him a job in Libya. Upon their arrival in Libya, many migrant workers were forced to hand over their passports to their employers. Human rights groups have denounced such practices, arguing they amount to little more than indentured servitude. The flight back to Bangladesh for al Islam and his fellow migrants will be free, but he and many of his fellow Bangladeshis face crushing debts. ""We are very helpless now; we are beggars now,"" al Islam said. Djerba airport officials said 25 flights were scheduled to take off Friday for Cairo. The French government has helped with the Egyptian airlift by chartering several passenger planes to Cairo. A number of charter flights are scheduled as well to India, Jordan, China, Vietnam and Dubai.","""We are helpless now""

"Cairo (CNN) -- Predawn gunfire and clashes from a violent military crackdown on protesters in Cairo's Tahrir Square on Saturday left Egyptians feeling shocked, confused and angered in the hours that followed. Long bursts of machine-gun fire erupted overnight starting around 3 a.m., when scores of soldiers backed by armored personnel carriers launched a raid on the square. Amateur video posted on YouTube showed troops storming the square's central roundabout amid rattling gunfire. Hundreds of protesters -- calling for Egypt's ruling military council to prosecute former president, Hosni Mubarak -- fled the scene as clouds of tear gas billowed through central Cairo. Among them were at least four wounded and bleeding men. Protesters tried to stop an ambulance from leaving the square. Two badly beaten men in military uniform were lying in the back of the vehicle. It is not clear whether or not they were troops engaged in the crackdown -- or whether they were some of the 15 uniformed army officers and soldiers who defied direct orders by joining a protest of tens of thousands of demonstrators in Tahrir Square on Friday. By morning, security forces withdrew from the square, leaving behind spent bullet casings and in one place, a pool of blood. Egyptian military confirmed that one person died from a gunshot wound overnight and that 42 people were detained, including three foreigners. ""It was a disaster,"" said protester Shadi Essam. ""The army attacked us in coordination with the police."" Essam said activists tried to help the dissenting military personnel to escape the crackdown by dressing four of them as civilians. Gen. Adel Amara, a member of the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces, said security personnel did not attack the protesters. ""Because of the pushing and clashes between the armed forces -- who I assure you had no weapons whatsoever -- because of clashes and pushing and shoving and you can imagine how a big group of protesters and soldiers could get some bruises in the pushing and shoving. Four from the armed forces (who joined the protesters) have some bruises plus nine civilian protesters,"" he said. Tensions mounted between demonstrators and the military hours before the raid. Late Friday, activists were seen confronting two military officers who tried to approach the square's central traffic circle. Demonstrators shoved the officers, knocking their hats off their heads, and then pursued them as they fled the square. By daybreak, the military had withdrawn from Tahrir. Lines of barbed wire and several burned-out trucks blocked vehicle traffic from entering the area. The clashes came a day after large crowds of protesters amassed at Tahrir Square, many of them angry with Egypt's new military rulers. After Mubarak's ouster in February, the military took control -- riding a wave of popularity for refusing to fire on pro-democracy protesters during 18 days of anti-government protests. But in the weeks since, the secretive 20-man council has produced increasing frustration and criticism from different portions of the Egyptian political spectrum. Critics have complained of human rights abuses and lack of transparency in the council's decision-making process. On Friday, some soldiers joined the protests in a direct challenge to Egypt's military rulers. For long intervals, they took to one of the stages erected in the crowded square and called for the country's military rulers to be replaced. ""If they really wanted to prosecute these corrupt officials they would have done it immediately. That's why we are here today,"" one of the protesting officers said during the Friday protests. Earlier this week, several military officers took to the Internet, recording video statements accusing the chairman of the ruling council, Field Marshal Mohammed Tantawi, of protecting Mubarak from prosecution and of leading a counterrevolutionary movement. ""He should step down. He makes stupid moves. He did not learn from the mistakes of the last 60 years. Military should not run countries,"" said Mohamed Ibrahim Garib, who makes a living importing and exporting clothing, on Saturday. Tempers flared at one point between soldiers and citizens outside the gates of the Egyptian Museum, which has been used in past months as a detainment center by the Egyptian military. An officer fired shots in the air, prompting angry youths to mob the gates and hurl stones into the museum compound. After several minutes, the confrontation subsided. The military issued a communique Saturday morning, accusing a former member of Hosni Mubarak's long-ruling National Democratic Party of ""inciting people in Tahrir."" The military announced it had issued arrest warrants for NDP member Ibrahim Kamel and several of his associates, after accusing them of being ""present in Tahrir Square after curfew as thugs and scaring the citizens."" In scenes reminiscent of street protests last January and February, activists have once again blocked entry into Tahrir, using coils of barbed wire apparently left behind by the military.

"(CNN) -- The first woman to be president of Kosovo took office Thursday after being elected by the Kosovo Assembly in a special session. Atifete Jahjaga, 35, is the former deputy general director of Kosovo police. She received 80 votes in the 120-member Assembly. Her election follows a ruling by the constitutional court that the process leading to the election of businessman Behgjet Pacolli as president on February 22 was unconstitutional. Opposition members boycotted the session, leaving fewer lawmakers than required by law, it said. The opposition threatened to repeat the boycott if Pacolli ran again. Jahjaga, who has no political background and is a relative unknown among the Kosovo public, came up as a compromise candidate only Wednesday night in a meeting that included Pacolli, Prime Minister Hashim Thaci and the leader of the main opposition party, Isa Mustafa. The U.S. ambassador to Kosovo, Christopher Dell, took part as a mediator. At a news conference Wednesday night, Thaci said a memorandum of agreement reached in the meeting calls for formation of a committee to alter the constitution so that the president would be directly elected by the people. It says a presidential election is to be held six to nine months after the constitutional change takes effect. The agreement also calls for forming a committee to amend election law in time for parliamentary and local elections in 2013. Former President Pacolli's decision to withdraw as a candidate played an important part in ending the crisis, Thaci, Mustafa and Dell said Wednesday night.","Atifete Jahjaga, a relative unknown, was selected as a compromise candidate .

"Nairobi, Kenya (CNN) -- Six Kenyan political leaders who are accused of crimes against humanity following the country's disputed 2007 elections will make their first appearance Thursday before the International Criminal Court in The Hague. The court's top prosecutor, Luis Moreno Ocampo, named the six as suspects in December, claiming they organized violence that left more than 1,000 people dead and displaced hundreds of thousands more. The suspects are Deputy Prime Minister Uhuru Kenyatta, Cabinet Secretary Francis Muthaura, former national police chief Hussein Ali, former Agriculture Minister William Ruto, radio journalist Joshua Arap Sang and opposition leader Henry Kosgey. Three are from one side of the political dispute, and three are from the other. Last month, Kenya challenged the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court, saying its own authorities will investigate and prosecute the cases on Kenyan soil. The Netherlands-based court calls itself, on its website, as ""an independent international organization ... established to help end impunity for the perpetrators of the most serious crimes of concern to the international community."" Kenya's disputed presidential election sparked chaos that escalated into ethnic violence pitting supporters of incumbent President Mwai Kibaki against those of challenger Raila Odinga, who was later named prime minister in a power-sharing agreement. Muthaura, Kenyatta and Ali are accused of committing or contributing to the killing, rape and other acts of violence against supporters of the opposition Orange Democratic Movement. Ruto, Sang and Kosgey are accused of being co-perpetrators in the murder, deportation and commission of other offenses against supporters of Kenya's Party of National Unity.","The six are accused of organizing violence that left more than 1,000 dead .

"New York (CNN) -- An average of $32 million a day in national parks revenue could be shut off if the Beltway showdown results in a government shutdown, officials say. The measure would be the first shutdown in more than 15 years, shuttering national parks, seashores and historic sites, and barring some 800,000 daily visitors, according to David Barna, a spokesman for the National Parks Service. Places such as Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming and Grand Canyon National Park in Arizona would be closed as a result of the impasse. Tourist draws such as the Smithsonian National Museums in Washington would be locked and parades such as the National Cherry Blossom Festival could be called off, though organizers have pledged to hold a short parade despite the outcome. That festival draws roughly 1 million visitors each year. Congressional lawmakers have been scrambling to negotiate a spending bill set to expire Friday, worrying those reliant on park tourism cash. ""These parks are the economic engines of some communities,"" said Barna. ""They're often the largest employer in an area,"" referencing a network of restaurants, shops and hotels that often surround historic sites. No budget deal as shutdown looms . Barna, who says he remembers the last shutdown in 1995, says the potential loss of revenue could stymie local businesses. ""The biggest difference from '95 may be the affect on our website,"" he said. The National Parks Service website tallies roughly 1 million daily hits, catering to would-be travelers and inquisitive students of history. ""It's the most popular website in the federal government,"" Barna said. As part of the agency's contingency measures, it plans to post an out-of-service notice in place of the website. Meanwhile, some 17,000 park service employees would be furloughed, with an additional 15,000 private contract workers also forced at least temporarily out of work. The impasse's affect on tourism is perhaps most visible in Charleston, South Carolina, where Civil War re-enactors are descending. Podcast: What happens in a shutdown? For years, Charleston has been planning the commemoration of the 150th anniversary of the start of the American Civil War. There, at Fort Sumter in Charleston Harbor, Confederate artillery opened fire on Union positions on April 12, 1861, igniting a bloody conflict that would last for the next fours years. The Tuesday re-enactment of the bombardment is expected to take place regardless of the shutdown, with the firing of guns to take place outside federal land. But the hundreds of blue- or gray-clad re-enactors who planned to camp at the historic fort will find it locked in the event of a shutdown. Money: The price of a shutdown . ""We were expecting 2,000 visitors a day from now until Easter,"" said Fort Sumter Tours owner Rick Mosteller, whose company ferries boatloads of Civil War buffs out to the historic fort. The effects, however, are also anticipated beyond Charleston Harbor. ""This is a tourist town,"" said city resident Robert Mikell. ""A lot of businesses here rely on these national sites."" Farther to the north on Liberty Island in New York, the possible shutdown had already skewed the plans of some travelers. What would be shut down? ""We started scheduling this week's vacation about four weeks ago,"" said Michigan resident Case Vaandering, who toured the Statue of Liberty on Thursday with his wife, Rochelle. The pair said they had changed their route to visit the Smithsonian museums in Washington before venturing up to New York, fearful that a shutdown would block their favored Washington sites and museums. ""We thought the parks weren't going to open for us when we got here,"" Vaandering said. iReport: Looming government shutdown . Others remain more hopeful. Kendra Barkoff, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Department of the Interior, said, ""We still believe that there is the opportunity for Congress to avoid a government shutdown."" But the agency, like others around Washington, is also preparing ""for all possible scenarios,"" she said. In the event of a shutdown, all visitors and nonessential employees at national parks and historic sites would be given 48 hours to leave.","The shutdown would be the first in more than 15 years .

"Khartoum, Sudan (CNN) -- A mutiny led by members of the Sudanese Armed Forces' Joint Integrated Units along the north/south border in Sudan has left up to 50 dead, officials said Monday. Fighting broke on Thursday in the city of Malakal near the airport when south Sudanese soldiers loyal to Gabriel Tang, a southern Sudanese militia leader who fought in a 22-year-old civil war alongside the Khartoum government, refused to turn in their weapons. An agreement to end the war, which pitted the Arab-Muslim-dominated government of north Sudan against the predominantly Christian and animist south, was signed in 2005. The Joint Integrated Units are a coordinated military force consisting of the northern Sudanese Armed Forces and the southern Sudanese Peoples Liberation Army. Tang's forces had been merged into the units along with SAF. ""The redeployment of Joint Integrated Units was scheduled to take place starting February 1 in accordance with the Comprehensive Peace Agreement,"" said Maj. Gen. Ahmad al-No, spokesperson for the Joint Defense Council, which oversees security and military arrangements between northern and southern Sudan. ""Tang fled SAF nearly a month ago and is somewhere around Malakal,"" al-No said. Southern Sudanese voted last month in a referendum on whether to remain part of a united Sudan or go independent, with final results to be announced on Monday. Preliminary results show an overwhelming vote in favor of independence. Official independence would be declared in July this year. During the civil war, a number of southern militias loyal to Khartoum fought against the Sudanese Peoples Liberation Movement/Army (SPLM/A), the rebel group that fought Khartoum and currently governs the south. Noting that it appears Tang is now in opposition to both Sudan's military and the southern separatists, al-No told CNN, ""I am concerned that he may have and affect on the security in the region.""","Fighting broke out Thursday in Malakal, near the border dividing northern, southern Sudan .

"(CNN)  -- A year ago, the worst environmental disaster in U.S. history began on April 20 -- which, ironically, also marked Earth Day. The catastrophe started with a massive explosion on an offshore oil drilling rig that killed 11 workers and sparked a huge fire that eventually sank the rig. More than 200 million gallons of crude oil gushed into the Gulf of Mexico over the next five months, killing thousands of marine animals and affecting thousands of people in the fishing industry -- already struggling in the economic downturn. CNN's full coverage of the Gulf oil disaster . The exact toll on the Gulf's ecosystem is still as murky as the ocean waters affected by the disaster. This year, as Earth Day approaches, tragedy and uncertainty may once again temper the mood of the annual event: Japan is still assessing what could be its worst environmental disaster -- the damage to its Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant by the March 11 earthquake and tsunami. The situation has forced other countries, including the United States, to take a closer look at the safety of nuclear power plants within their borders. The nuclear issue is still a fierce topic of debate, and environmental experts think it will be an important theme for this year's Earth Day on April 22. Recent polls suggest that Americans are divided over nuclear energy. More than half of the 1,012 respondents in a recent CNN poll said they opposed building more nuclear plants, while 46% said they favored it. When asked by CNN if they are OK with nuclear energy as a source of electricity, 57% of the respondents said they approved, while 42% disapproved. Despite the crisis in Japan, nuclear energy is still a centerpiece of President Obama's clean energy policy. His administration's fiscal year 2012 budget request includes $36 billion in loan guarantee authority to help spur growth in the nuclear industry. Energy secretary defends U.S. nuclear industry . Nuclear energy produces practically no pollution, and it is more reliable than other clean alternative sources -- like wind and solar energy -- that depend on the weather, according to nuclear power advocate Burton Richter, a Nobel Prize-winning physicist. While nuclear is his favorite clean energy source, there are other ways to create electricity that Richter believes can help achieve a reduction in greenhouse gases. Two years ago, Richter and 34 other Nobel laureates wrote a letter to Obama to encourage him to put more money into alternative energy research, including nuclear, wind and solar energy and renewable fuels. Richter, who also teaches at Stanford University, says the American public needs to pay close attention to how Congress is handling environmental issues. He is worried that too many people in Washington are more concerned about politics than the environment. ""We're not going to see a fee on carbon emissions, we're not going to see cap and trade, we're going to see a fight to see whether the EPA [Environmental Protection Agency] is going to be able to regulate anything,"" he predicted. ""It's not going to be a pretty year."" Richter encouraged everyone to use this year's Earth Day to speak out about the environmental issues that they care about. ""They should be thinking about their grandchildren and the world that those children are going to get left with,"" he said.  ""People need to let their government know, let their representatives know, that they are very concerned about this issue and they are going to hold their representatives accountable for their actions."" Besides being a call to action, Earth Day also continues to be a good opportunity for public education, he said. On April 22, Richter says he'll probably be speaking on campus about nuclear power, because Stanford students are interested in what happened in Japan and want to be assured that nuclear power is safe. Michael Vandenbergh, director of the Climate Change Research Network, says he hopes nuclear concerns don't overshadow other pressing environmental issues that Americans should remember as Earth Day approaches. ""We have to continue to discuss climate change, because if we get that problem wrong, many of the other things we talk about in the environmental area won't matter,"" said Vandenbergh, who also teaches at Vanderbilt University Law School. Both professors were encouraged to see that their students -- although probably not as politically outspoken as their counterparts when Earth Day began in 1970 -- are anxious to learn as much as they can about being environmentally friendly. Everyone should realize the importance of doing his or her part to help improve the environment for future generations, Vandenbergh said. ""Sometimes, people focus on the upfront cost rather than on the net benefit,"" Vandenbergh said, referring to the price of more efficient cars, home weatherization products or new heating and cooling units for our houses. ""Individuals have a much larger role than they realize in both contributing to environmental problems and to the solutions.""","Earth Day will be held on April 22 .
A year ago, the environmental community was concerned about the Gulf oil spill .

"(CNN) -- Amanda Garcia's peaceful life in Saltillo, Mexico, was shaken this past March when she witnessed a military convoy heading at full speed and against traffic on one of the city's important avenues. The lawyer had taken an alternate route to get home sooner and be with her 7-year-old son. It had been a difficult day in Saltillo, the capital of Coahuila state: Seven people had been killed and four police officers were injured in a series of firefights that caused alarm throughout the city, the state attorney general's office said. A few yards from reaching her home, she was stopped at a military checkpoint. ""When I parked I saw at least six soldiers in front of my car, getting out of their vehicle and aiming at me, asking me to get out. One came close to my door and I heard a sound I had never heard before, apparently of a weapon when you take the safety off. Few times in my life had I felt so scared,"" she said. After an inspection, the soldiers told Amanda that they were looking for a vehicle similar to hers and that she was free to return home. ""Usually, the presence of the army does not make me nervous at all, to the contrary. But that day, I really thought they were going to shoot at me,"" she said. ""I've never seen the city so empty."" Two days later, a soldier died and another was injured in a confrontation with suspected drug traffickers, after four cartel roadblocks were reported in various parts of the city, according to the attorney general's office. Saltillo, with some 700,000 residents, is a colonial city that until recently was known for its auto industry -- General Motors, Chrysler and Freightliner have plants there -- and construction. However, the situation has changed progressively until the city has reached notoriety for other reasons. According to a report from intelligence company Stratfor, the Gulf and Sinaloa cartels formed the New Federation, an alliance combating the Zetas cartel, and launched an offensive to control the trafficking routes in Mexico's northeast. ""There were pacts here, and now those pacts are broken and a battle has begun between various criminal groups for this territory. This is evident,"" said Raul Vera, the Catholic bishop of Saltillo. The Coahuila attorney general's office declined to let any of its officials be interviewed to give their version of escalating violence in the region. ""This was something that has been coming for a while, not only the dispute for control of the territory for the routes, but also for control of the population, through terror, (and) control of the economy,"" said Blanca Martinez, director of the Fray Juan de Larios Human Rights Center. In the four years of Felipe Calderon's term so far, more than 34,612 drug-related killings have been recorded in Mexico, of which 659 happened in northern Coahuila, according to the federal government. Of these, a little more than 3% occurred in Saltillo. Like neighboring states Nuevo Leon and Tamaulipas, all on the U.S. border, Coahuila has seen peaks in violence associated with the capture or killing of important trafficking leaders who had influence in the region. ""The people in the city are afraid. It can be felt in the streets, homes, with friends. All the conversations are about security now,"" said Jorge Muniz, a young graphic designer who lives in the city. The day after the confrontation between security forces and the presumed drug traffickers, a rumor surged on social media that there would be a curfew in Saltillo, something that was denied by Gov. Jorge Torres Lopez. ""Even then the city took its precautions and that false curfew turned into a real curfew,"" Muniz said. ""The city was deserted from five in the afternoon. There were few people in the streets, and after seven at night, it looked like a ghost town, shops closed, with little traffic."" He added, ""I think this is just the beginning of the violent acts. Other nearby cities, like Monterrey, the capital of Nuevo Leon, also started like this and now are cities where they live a climate of strong violence."" Another indicator of the growing insecurity in Saltillo and the rest of Coahuila is the increase in the number of disappearances in the past two years, the majority believed to be linked to organized crime. From 2007 to January 2011, the Fray Juan de Larios Human Rights Center, in coordination with United for Our Disappeared of Coahuila, documented 118 disappearances, of which 91 presumably were related to organized crime, according to a report by the organization. The report indicates that the average age of the victims is 30, the majority are men, and five of them were minors at the time of their disappearance. Five others were women. Only one out of the 118 cases has evidence that the objective of the disappearance was kidnapping. There was never a request for ransom from the others. Another characteristic of the disappearances in Coahuila is that they happen in groups. Only 17 of the victims disappeared individually, and in 23 cases it is alleged that there was involvement by police or the military, the organizations reported. The state attorney general's office declined to comment on the disappearances. Saltillo could be considered a refuge for the Zetas, the U.S. consul in Monterrey, Bruce Williamson, said in February 2010 in a diplomatic cable published by WikiLeaks. The cable is full of doubt about the effectiveness of the Mexican military in the fight against organized crime. In another cable from 2009, the consul writes that the security model implemented in Coahuila by then-Gov. Humberto Moreira was inadequate, and described them as ""baby steps.""","Firefights have been recorded in Saltillo, Mexico .
Two cartels have united to fight a third in the area, an intelligence firm says .

"St. Paul, Minnesota (CNN) -- The long, complicated legal road for NFL players and owners kicked off in a federal courtroom Wednesday, as both sides made their case for and against lifting a lockout that could delay the start of the football season. At the conclusion of the hearing, Judge Susan Richard Nelson said she expected to make a decision in a couple of weeks. The lockout is the result of an ongoing dispute between the NFL owners and the players who failed to reach a collective-bargaining agreement last month. Tom Brady, Drew Brees, Peyton Manning and seven other players have filed a lawsuit on behalf of other current and eligible NFL players against the league to halt the lockout, which could affect the start of the 2011-12 season scheduled for September 8. What to expect from Brady v. NFL . They want a preliminary injunction to block the lockout.  The players also want a future trial to determine if the NFL lockout is in violation of federal antitrust laws. In his opening statement to the judge, the players' attorney James Quinn stressed the players face ""irreparable harm"" to their careers, income and health, if a preliminary injunction is not granted. NFL attorney David Boies disagreed with that position. ""They say there is irreparable harm, we say there is not,"" Boies told the judge. ""There are numerous factual disagreements between the parties."" Nelson asked several times whether an evidentiary hearing is necessary to resolve the factual disputes.  But Quinn said, among other things, that would only ""delay"" this process. The players present in the courtroom were Vincent Jackson of the San Diego Chargers, Ben Leber and Brian Robison of the Minnesota Vikings, Mike Vrabel of the Kansas City Chiefs, draft-eligible Texas A&M linebacker Von Miller and retired NFL player Carl Eller. On Monday, Nelson agreed to combine Brady v. National Football League with another class-action lawsuit, Eller v. NFL, filed in March by a group primarily made up of retired NFL players. That second lawsuit is ""potentially more threatening"" because the plaintiffs in Eller v. NFL are not bargaining members of the NFL's players union, the National Football League Players Association, or NFLPA, and the NFL cannot argue that they engaged in bad faith during collective-bargaining discussions, according to SI.com's legal analyst Michael McCann. ""The NFLPA may be removed from the picture in Eller v. NFL, a point which would take away a key defense the NFL enjoys in Brady v. NFL,"" McCann said. Last month, negotiations between the NFL and players union aimed at preventing a work stoppage broke down. The union decertified itself. By giving up their collective-bargaining rights, the players could file individual antitrust suits against the league and the owners. That move set the stage for a lengthy legal battle with owners. At the time, the NFL accused the union of walking away from ""a very good deal on the table."" If the players are locked out from playing in September, it would be the first NFL work stoppage since 1987, with months of labor and legal maneuvering for football fans already confused about how a $9 billion industry lacks enough money to satisfy everyone. NFL prepares players for lockout . The heart of the issue between the players and the owners is how to divide the league's $9 billion in revenue. Right now, NFL owners take $1 billion off the top of that revenue stream. After that, the players get about 60%. The owners say that the current labor deal doesn't take into account the rising costs related to building stadiums and promoting the game. The players argue that the league has not sufficiently opened up its books to prove this point. In addition, the owners also want to increase the season by two games, which some players are against because of the risk of injuries. While star players earn millions of dollars each year, the median NFL salary is $790,000 and the average career lasts about four years. A lockout also affects the league's employees: the receptionists, ticket salespeople and stadium workers. The New York Jets have announced that they will require all business-side employees to take a one-week unpaid leave each month during any lockout. Poll: Who do you think is to blame? The lockout will not stop the NFL Draft, which will proceed as scheduled on April 28-30, the league said. All other regular off-season activity would cease, threatening to delay or cancel the start of the new season. The teams might approach the draft a bit differently in the midst of a lockout, according to Steve Politi, a sports columnist for The Star-Ledger in Newark, New Jersey. ""Teams might (pick) based on needs rather than the best players available, because who knows when they'll be able to address those needs on the free-agent market,"" Politi said. It is possible for the NFL season to go forward with replacement players, but analyst McCann said that is not likely: . ""Practical and legal hurdles would make doing so extremely unlikely,"" he said. But it's still a possibility. ""The NFL might argue that if NFL players won't accept the league's best CBA (collective-bargaining agreement) offer, the league has no choice but to resume games with other players who are willing to play,"" he added. CNN's Tricia Escobedo reported from Atlanta, and Chris Welch reported from St. Paul.","NEW: Federal hearing on lifting the NFL lockout wraps up .

"(CNN) -- A blogger who endured a four-year stint in an Egyptian prison for his writings has been released, saying he was jailed for defying convention. Abdel Kareem Nabil -- known by his blogger name, Kareem Amer -- is a self-proclaimed secularist who was convicted and imprisoned by Egypt for ""spreading information disruptive of public order and damaging to the country's reputation,"" ""incitement to hate Islam"" and ""defaming the president of the republic,"" according to a statement from the Committee to Protect Journalists. The former law student at Cairo's Al-Azhar University is a critic of conservative Muslims and has accused his school of promoting extremist ideas, calling Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak a ""dictator,"" it said. Nabil was released from prison November 16. The now famous blogger said he was jailed because he challenged tradition. ""There are things we inherit without even thinking about them,"" Nabil said. ""I tried to change my way of thinking. ""I tried to read what was forbidden in our house, things written by people who in my home and in religious institutions are considered infidels.""

Others, like Egyptian blogger Wael Abbas, say they have faced cyber attacks from state security for years. ""There are troubles that start online,"" he said. Abbas blames the Egyptian government for ""trying to hack your website, trying to block it, trying to disable your account by sending fake reports that you're posting inappropriate material like they did with my you-tube, with my email, with my facebook."" While the internet is among few spaces where Egyptians can express themselves freely, it is far from risk-free. Upon his release, Nabil told reporters that police officers beat him just before he left prison, sending him off with a warning not to blog again.","A blogger who endured a stint in an Egyptian prison for his writings has been freed .

"Tokyo (CNN) -- The leak of highly radioactive water into the Pacific from the crippled Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant has stopped, Tokyo Electric Power Company said early Wednesday. The leak had stopped as of 5:38 a.m. Wednesday (4:38 p.m. ET), said the company, which runs the plant. Earlier, Tokyo Electric officials had said an attempt to plug the leak had shown a ""significant difference,"" despite the material not setting as hoped. The company had injected a silica-based polymer dubbed ""liquid glass"" to reduce the leak. The utility's assessment comes after the country's Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency said the substance had not hardened as expected. The material had been pumped from below into the leaking shaft at the plant's No. 2 reactor. The news was a bright spot amid a series of setbacks Japanese authorities faced Tuesday, including the detection of radiation in a fish and news that the water gushing into the Pacific had radiation levels millions of times above the regulatory limit. Readings from samples taken Saturday in the concrete pit outside the turbine building of the No. 2 reactor -- one of six at the crisis-plagued plant -- had radiation 7.5 million times the legal limit, a TEPCO official said. Newer findings, from Tuesday afternoon, showed a sizable drop to 5 million times the norm. Town near nuclear plant rejects Japanese utility's 'token' offer . The utility company also noted Tuesday that the radiation levels diminished sharply a few dozen meters from the leak, consistent with their assessment that the spill might have a minimal effect on sea life. But even in these spots, radiation levels remained several hundred thousand times the legal limit. Both the utility and Japan's nuclear safety agency said they didn't know how much water is leaking into the sea from reactor No. 2. But engineers have had to pour nearly 200 tons of water a day into the No. 2 reactor vessel to keep it cool, and regulators say they believe that is the water leaking out. Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Yukio Edano said the presence of radioactive iodine ""in one sample of fresh fish"" prompted authorities to regulate the radiation in seafood for the first time. While fishing has been forbidden within 20 kilometers (12 miles) of Fukushima Daiichi, there had been no restrictions on seafood, as there were for some vegetables and milk from certain locales. Now, the same radiation standards that apply to vegetables will apply to ocean products as well. Nuclear crisis explainer . ""The ""provisional ingestion limit, equivalent to vegetables and applied to fish and shellfish, will take effect immediately,"" the Cabinet minister said. Meanwhile, the deliberate dumping of radioactive water into the sea continues, Tokyo Electric said Wednesday. On Tuesday, Edano apologized for the decision to dump the water -- all part of the effort to curb the flow of the more toxic liquid spotted days ago rushing from outside the No. 2 unit. TEPCO said that as of Tuesday evening, more than 5,740 tons had been released -- about half the total volume. The process of expelling contaminated water in the plant's water treatment facility and around several of its reactors began Monday and will take five days, a Tokyo Electric official said. ""The water contains a high level of radiation,"" Edano said of the liquid being dumped into the Pacific. ""We are sorry for this decision we have to make."" Special coverage: Japan earthquake aftermath . The most contaminated batch of this water comes from outside the No. 6 reactor, likely having gotten in via groundwater (and not a breach in the unit itself), officials said. It has a concentration of iodine-131 that would be 100 times more than the maximum amount in tap water that infants could drink, and 10 times more than what would be OK in food. Overall, the dump equates to about 3 million gallons, noted Gary Was, a nuclear engineering professor from the University of Michigan. Yet Hidehiko Nishiyama, a Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency official, said, ""We've decided that discharging the contaminated water into the sea poses no major health hazard."" Experts say this is a fair assessment, given the likelihood the contamination should quickly dilute, especially if the tainted material is largely iodine-131, which loses half its radiation every eight days. ""To put this in perspective, the Pacific Ocean holds about 300 trillion swimming pools full of water, and they are going to release about five swimming pools full,"" said Timothy Jorgensen, chair of the radiation safety committee at Georgetown University Medical Center. ""So hopefully the churning of the ocean and the currents will quickly disperse this so that it gets to very dilute concentrations relatively quickly."" John Till, president of the South Carolina-based Risk Assessment Corp., said he does not expect to see any permanent effects on marine life, even close to the plant. However, he added that officials should monitor radiation levels closely -- in the ocean as well as in seafood that reaches restaurants and markets. U.S. scales back military aid units in Japan . A piece of good news, according to Japanese government reports, is that airborne radiation appears to be steadily falling around northeast Japan. Two measurements from 15 kilometers (nine miles) or less from the plant showed amounts of radioactive iodine-131 at 2 to 3.7 times the legal standard, with levels of a far longer-lasting cesium isotope well below the official limit. Also, utility and government officials have described conditions recently in the Fukushima Daiichi plant's reactors and spent nuclear fuel pools as generally stable. There have been exceptions -- like the new need to pump 3-meter-deep water from a drain outside the Nos. 5 and 6 units for fear it could rise, enter nearby turbine buildings and short out power for the units' nuclear fuel cooling systems. But such problems aren't occurring at the same pace, or with the same apparent severity, as was evident weeks ago. The top priority, however, is stopping the water that's been gushing directly into the Pacific through a cracked concrete shaft outside the No. 2 reactor. How to help in Japan relief efforts . Edano said Monday that the decision to dump tainted water from other reactors and the wastewater treatment facility was unavoidable in order to ensure the safety of the No. 2 reactor core. The idea is to expeditiously pump the tainted water from around the No. 2 reactor's turbine building, lowering levels inside so that water no longer rushes out into the sea, a Japanese nuclear safety official said. This came after the first two failed attempts to plug the problematic crack -- one by pouring in concrete, the other using a chemical compound mixed with sawdust and newspaper. Reactors No. 1 and No. 3, which have lower levels of water, need to be drained as well. Tokyo Electric's plan is to pump that water to other storage tanks, including some that still need to be set up. Water in and around the Nos. 5 and 6 reactors is being jettisoned directly in the sea, officials said. Interactive map on Japan crisis . Another big problem may be that authorities still don't know how exactly the gushing water got contaminated, where it came from or how to fix potential leaks and cracks deep inside the reactor complex and nuclear fuel. Michael Friedlander, a former senior U.S. nuclear engineer, said late Monday that authorities will continue to have problems related to excess, radioactive water -- and the need to dump some of it -- as long as they inject huge amounts in to prevent fuel rods from overheating in reactors' cores and spent fuel pools. ""This is not a one-off deal,"" Friedlander said of dumping radioactive water into the ocean. ""This issue of water and water management is going to plague them until they can get (fully operating) long-term core cooling.""

"Port-Au-Prince, Haiti (CNN) -- Anger swept Port-au-Prince on Wednesday as protests erupted throughout the Haitian capital the day after election results were announced. Mobs charging election fraud burned the headquarters of the government-backed candidate and blocked roads using earthquake rubble and flaming tires. At the smoldering headquarters of candidate Jude Celestin, one man shouted that life was better under the Duvaliers, referring to years of Haiti's father-son dictatorship. At least one person died in the post-election violence, authorities said. ""People are very angry,"" said Franz Large, a Haitian doctor who lives near the burned headquarters. ""People expected there would be a fair election."" He accused the government of adding the names of those who perished in the earthquake to voter lists, to push the vote in their favor. He also said many people feared they would lose out on cash-for-work programs if they did not vote for the government. ""We need someone who has the trust of the people,"" Lange said. ""It's a very sad day for people who believe in democracy."" All flights in and out of Port-au-Prince, including American Airlines flights, were canceled, said Henry Marc-Charles of Haiti's national airport authority. Early Wednesday, the normally bustling city felt an eerie quiet as residents hunkered down in their homes, fearful of potential danger on streets normally jammed with people and traffic. Many shops and businesses remained shuttered throughout the day. But the quiet was pierced by large protests as thousands marched on the streets yelling that the election had been stolen from them. They chanted ""Tet Kale!"" which means bald head in Haiti and is the moniker used by the popular musician and presidential candidate Michel Martelly. Some of the protesters wanted Martelly to speak publicly. Martelly had planned a news conference but canceled due to security concerns. Instead he issued a short statement Wednesday evening. ""Since last night, the (electoral council) put our country in total chaos by publishing manipulated results,"" he said. ""Since then, the whole country reacted and is now in turmoil. They stood up to defend their votes and asked that they be respected. ""I understand your frustration,"" he said. ""You have the constitutional right to peacefully protest. I am with you and will be all the way to victory. Tet kale."" Polls had suggested Martelly, a political novice, had emerged as a front-runner, but the Provisional Electoral Council announced Tuesday night that he had come in third behind former first lady Mirlande Manigat and Jude Celestin, the head of the state-run transportation company who was handpicked by President Rene Preval as his successor. No candidate won a majority, forcing a runoff set for January 16, four days after the first anniversary of the quake. If the results hold, Martelly will not be in that runoff. The Joint OAS (Organization of American States) - CARICOM (Caribbean Community) election observation mission said Wednesday the results were not the last word on the Haitian election. It said candidates have a legal recourse to pursue a challenge -- and they should use it. The mission said in a statement that it called on the electoral council to ""ensure that these claims and challenges that are part of the contestation process are treated with the strictness, transparency and fairness they deserve in this difficult electoral environment where suspicions abound."" A final outcome in that process is expected on December 20. The post-tabulation protests Wednesday were largely fueled by Martelly's supporters. ""He's our president,"" they said. Martelly's political advisor, Daniel Supplice, said that Martelly was huddling with his advisors to decide how he would proceed but the campaign has already said it will challenge the results. Supplice said it was the government's responsibility to ensure that the protests do not spiral into chaos. ""We did not ask for anyone to take to the streets,"" Supplice said. ""This is only a natural reaction. People have the right to have their vote respected."" Preval, barred from seeking another term, has grown increasingly unpopular for what Haitians perceive as a lack of progress in their troubled homeland. And it had been feared all along that a win or runoff spot for Celestin would trigger unrest in the Haitian capital. The next president of Haiti will inherit the daunting task of leading this Caribbean nation in its struggle to recover from years of dictatorship and poverty compounded by the killer earthquake, Hurricane Tomas and now a cholera epidemic that has sickened almost 100,000 people. Protests erupted immediately after the result were announced Tuesday night and spilled over into Wednesday. A police commissioner in the northern town of Cap Hatien reported one person had died in violence there. In a radio speech Wednesday, Preval appealed for calm and urged the candidates to thoroughly review the electoral council's data. The council said Manigat, a Sorbonne-educated professor and a former first lady of Haiti, led the presidential election with 31.37 of the votes. Celestin narrowly ranked second with 22.48 percent of the votes while Martelly received 21.84 percent. But the vote was fraught with allegations of fraud. Martelly said aloud what many others in Haiti were thinking: Preval would go to any lengths to ensure a win for Celestin and preserve the power of his party, INITE. The U.S. Embassy issued a statement Tuesday saying that the United States stands ready to support efforts to review irregularities in the vote so that results are ""consistent with the will of the Haitian people expressed in their votes. ""Like others, the government of the United States is concerned by the Provisional Electoral Council's announcement of preliminary results from the November 28 national elections that are inconsistent with the published results of the National Election Observation Council (CNO), which had more than 5,500 observers and observed the vote count in 1,600 voting centers nationwide,"" the embassy said. The CNO, a European Union-backed local election monitoring group, had said Celestin was running behind the other two candidates. United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon expressed concern Wednesday over the post-election violence. He urged the candidates ""to exhaust the formal remedies and legal procedures, which will allow a clearer picture to emerge."" ""A peaceful solution to the current situation is crucial not only to confront the cholera epidemic in the short-term but also to create the conditions in the medium term for recovery and development from the earthquake,"" Ban said in a statement. The anger voiced on the streets was also targeted at the United Nations after reports suggested the cholera outbreak originated in a Nepalese peacekeepers' camp. In a tense scene Wednesday, protesters faced off with U.N. soldiers from Brazil tasked with guarding the road at the entrance of the electoral council's office. ""No peace mission. No MINUSTAH,"" protesters said, referring the United Nations Haiti mission by its French acronym. Veteran Haitian journalist Ernest Moskolot said Haitian people were simply fed up. They endured an earthquake, a hurricane and cholera. It was time, he said, for the government to deliver. ""This is a tough time for Haiti,""Moskolot said. ""I got a feeling God has something for us. We cannot take it anymore."" CNN's Devon Sayers contributed to this report .","NEW: At least one person is dead in post-election violence .

"(CNN) -- A man who had a relationship with college student Jenni-Lyn Watson was charged Saturday with second-degree murder after the discovery of a body believed to be hers, authorities in Syracuse, New York, said. A massive manhunt for the dance major, who'd been missing since November 19, culminated with the discovery of what are believed to be her remains at 10:30 a.m. at Clay Central Park in North Syracuse, the Onondaga County Sheriff's Office said. On Saturday, Steven Pieper was charged in her killing. Pieper, 21, and Watson, 20, had dated on and off for 18 months, said District Attorney William Fitzpatrick at a Saturday press conference. ""Our indication is Ms. Watson desired this relationship to end in early October ... Apparently that message didn't get through to Mr. Pieper,"" Fitzpatrick said. Authorities believe Watson was killed in her Liverpool residence on the morning of November 19. Her body was ""dumped, frankly, like garbage"" in a heavily wooded area a couple miles away, Fitzpatrick said. Pieper has been interviewed twice, Fitzpatrick said. ""He has denied involvement."" The suspect, who was taken into custody Saturday, was arraigned Saturday evening in Clay Town Court, CNN affiliate YNN reported. A judge entered a not guilty plea on behalf of Pieper, who will have a preliminary hearing Friday, YNN said. He is currently being held without bail. Fitzpatrick told CNN Syracuse affiliate WSTM that it appeared someone tried to conceal the body, but that it was not buried. It was behind a utility shed, he said. An autopsy will be conducted Sunday. Watson was last seen at her family's home. She was on Thanksgiving break from Mercyhurst College in Erie, Pennsylvania. Liverpool is a suburb of Syracuse. ""This [disappearance] is extremely uncharacteristic for Jenni-Lynn,"" Sgt. Robert Marshall said earlier this week. Watson's parents reported her missing the night of November 19. The college junior's purse and other personal items were found at the home, but a Verizon LG enV3 phone was missing. One call was made on the phone from a heavily wooded area near other residences, said Marshall, who declined to provide details. Someone other than Watson made the call, Fitzpatrick said. The phone has not been recovered. Pieper is alleged to have been at Watson's residence on the morning of her disappearance and is believed to be the last to have seen her, the sheriff's department said in a statement. Detectives are looking for anyone who may have seen Pieper's black 2008 Volkswagen Jetta in the vicinity of Watson's home or near the area where the body was found. Fitzpatrick said authorities believe the Jetta carried Watson's body. The district attorney said he spoke Saturday with Watson's parents. ""These people are extraordinary people,"" Fitzpatrick said. ""They are now trusting that justice will be done."" Simultaneous vigils were held Wednesday for Watson. One of the church vigils was organized by the family; the other was held in a chapel at Mercyhurst College, a Catholic school. About 200 people attended, including members of the football team, which has a NCAA Division II game this weekend. ""You felt overwhelming worry, but you still felt there was reason to hope,"" Mercyhurst spokeswoman Debbie Morton said. Watson was a dance major and ballet dancer at Mercyhurst. ""It is a highly disciplined area,"" Morton said of Watson's field of study. Mercyhurst College will have a Sunday evening prayer service and will offer counseling beforehand. ""Our Mercyhurst family poured their hearts and souls into finding Jenni-Lyn in a genuine outpouring of humanity,"" college president Tom Gamble said in a statement. ""Her death is devastating to our entire college community. We continue to pray for her family and extend our deepest sympathies.""

"(CNN) -- Coming off two days of demonstrations, Saudi Arabia's Interior Ministry warned Saturday that it would crack down on protesters who continue to take their grievances to the streets. Saudi security forces will be ""authorized to take all measures against anyone who tries to break the law and cause disorder,"" the ministry said, according to the country's state-run news agency. The government cited how some were trying ""to get around the systems"" and ""achieve illegitimate goals."" The Interior Ministry spokesman said that kingdom law prevents all kinds of demonstrations, protests, strikes and even a call for them because they're against Sharia law and Saudi values and traditions. In response, Ibrahim al-Mugaiteeb, president of the Human Rights First Society, told CNN that the Interior Ministry is ""not at all sensitive"" to the massive unrest sweeping the Arab world. ""I'm hoping that the Ministry of the Interior and the government of Saudi Arabia will not choose to take the security solution road because that was already tested in other Arab countries and, by God, it did not work,"" said al-Mugaiteeb, who's in Saudi Arabia. On Saturday, the Saudi government downplayed Friday's protests in the Eastern Province, saying the people weren't calling for a regime change. ""The protests that took place in the Eastern Province were small and were not political in nature,"" a Saudi government official told CNN. ""The protesters weren't calling for regime change, they were asking for more jobs and calling for release of prisoners they feel were imprisoned unjustly."" The official, who asked not to be named because he was not authorized to speak to the media, said Friday's protest was not worrisome. ""We don't feel they will spread throughout the kingdom or become bigger in nature,"" he said. Demonstrators who protested in Eastern Province were demanding the release of Shiite prisoners they feel are being held without cause. An outspoken Shiite prayer leader who demonstrators say was arrested more than a week ago was a focal point of the ""day of rage"" protest, said Ibrahim al-Mugaiteeb, president of the Human Rights First Society. Sheikh Tawfeeq Al-Amer was arrested Sunday after he gave a sermon two days earlier, on February 25, stating that Saudi Arabia should become a constitutional monarchy, human rights activists said. Friday's protest comes on the heels of two similar demonstrations held in the province Thursday, al-Mugaiteeb said, when about 200 protesters in the city of Qatif and 100 protesters in the city of Awamiyya called for the release of Shiite prisoners. Al-Mugaiteeb said authorities arrested 22 people who participated in Thursday's protest in Qatif. ""We deplore this action by the Saudi security forces,"" he said. Another protest took place in Riyadh after Friday prayer, according to two Saudi activists. The sources asked not to be identified because of concerns for their safety. According to the activists, as many as 40 anti-government demonstrators gathered outside Al-Rajhi Mosque for a short protest. At least one man involved in organizing the protest was arrested by Saudi police, the activists said. The activists said the protesters attracted a crowd of worshipers leaving the mosque. Some of the protesters carried signs showing a map of Saudi Arabia that did not contain the words ""Kingdom of Saudi Arabia,"" a clear affront to the Saudi royal family. The government official told CNN that he was not aware of any protests or arrests in Riyadh. When asked about the various rights groups in the kingdom who have been calling for the creation of a constitutional monarchy over the course of the past 2 weeks, the government official on Saturday stated, ""Yes, there are groups here asking for more rights, calling for constitutional reforms, and that is their right to do so. King Abdullah has always encouraged a national dialogue and continues to do so."" The official insisted that the king ""is doing all he can to improve things for Saudis."" ""But in Saudi Arabia -- it's not like other countries -- we don't have or allow protests here. If people have a grievance, they can go and address it with the governors of their provinces or they can go to the Royal Court and address grievances directly there,"" the official said. Saudi Arabia has cracked down on protests in the past. Shiites are a minority in Saudi Arabia. They live primarily in the Eastern Province, where many major oil companies operate. The protests come as sectarian violence between Shiites and Sunnis flares in neighboring Bahrain. Analysts believe protests in Bahrain could spill over into Saudi Arabia's oil fields, located mostly in Shiite provinces. After three months abroad for medical treatment, Saudi King Abdullah returned home late last month to a Middle East shaken by unrest, and announced a series of sweeping measures aimed at relieving economic hardship and meeting with Bahrain's beleaguered monarch. The Saudi government released three Shiite political prisoners ahead of the king's return.","NEW: Security forces can take ""all measures"" against lawbreakers .

"Oranjestad, Aruba (CNN) -- Aruban prosecutors plan to release Tuesday the results of tests conducted on a jawbone found on an island beach and disclose whether it belongs to missing U.S. teenager Natalee Holloway, officials said. The tests, conducted at the Netherlands Forensic Institute in The Hague, Netherlands, were to first determine whether the bone is that of a human or that of an animal. If the bone is human, authorities said, they would attempt to determine through DNA testing if it belonged to Holloway. The Alabama 18-year-old was last seen on the island in 2005. Aruba Solicitor General Taco Stein said prosecutors will issue a statement Tuesday with the test results. Holloway's dental records were sent to the forensic institute last week, according to the FBI. Tim Miller, director of Texas EquuSearch -- a search-and-rescue organization that has looked for Natalee Holloway -- said the girl's father believes it is his daughter's bone. ""Dave has been in contact with Aruban authorities and spoke with FBI this morning, the agent working the case. Dave believes it is Natalee,"" Miller said about Holloway's father, Dave Holloway. A call to the father was not immediately returned Monday. Part of a jawbone with a tooth was found earlier this month by an American tourist near the Phoenix Hotel, a large resort on the western side of the island, Aruban prosecutor Peter Blanken said. Contacted by CNN, the hotel referred questions to local authorities. The prosecutor said the bone was initially examined by a forensic expert in Aruba, who determined it was from a young woman. But Blanken cautioned the final determination would be made by the forensic institute. Also on Monday, police collected a second bone that was found earlier this month on the beach by a New Jersey family, said Ana Angela, spokeswoman for Aruban prosecutors. However, ""it does not appear to be human,"" said Richard Roy, general manager of the Westin Hotel. The bone was found in the same general area as the first. The family, who was staying at the Westin, put it on their hotel balcony. They told CNN that once they returned home and heard media reports on the jawbone, they called the FBI and then contacted the Westin. Staffers at the hotel found the bone on the balcony and notified police. Holloway was last seen in the early hours of May 30, 2005, leaving an Oranjestad nightclub with Joran van der Sloot and two other men. She was visiting the island with about 100 classmates to celebrate their graduation from Mountain Brook High School in suburban Birmingham, Alabama. Van der Slootwasdetained twice in connection with Holloway's disappearance but never charged. He is now awaiting trial in Lima, Peru, on a murder charge in the death of Peruvian student Stephany Flores. Her body was found in May in a hotel room registered to van der Sloot. A surveillance camera captured images of the two entering the room . Van der Sloot, 23, is also charged with wire fraud and extortion in Alabama for allegedly attempting to extort more than $250,000 from Holloway's family in return for disclosing the location of her body.

"LONDON, England -- A military-grade laser that blinds temporarily is the latest security technology available to wealthy superyacht owners afraid of pirate attacks. The SeaLase laser temporarily blinds pirates -- preventing them from attacking the yacht. The ""SeaLase"" laser, similar to weapons used for crowd control in Iraq and Afghanistan by the U.S. military, has a range of  four kilometers and becomes harder to look at the closer an attacker comes. At a distance of one kilometer, attackers develop strong nausea and can no longer see, according to Lasersec Systems, the Finnish company that developed the lasers for commercial use. ""We don't have guns, so we need non-lethal systems to defend yachts,"" Lasersec CEO Scott Buchter told CNN. Buchter, who recently launched the $104,000 multi-colored laser at Monaco Yacht Show, says the loss of eyesight the laser inflicts is only temporary and that no permanent damage is inflicted. Hi-tech military-grade security systems like SeaLase have become increasingly popular with superyacht owners looking to protect multi-millon dollar yachts on the open seas. Pirate attacks on oil tankers and other boats in dangerous waters like the Gulf of Aden off the coast of Somalia -- a maritime link between Europe and Asia --have fueled the growing worry that superyachts may be the next target. Because law regarding the use of deadly force on ships is ambiguous in some countries and the transport of guns is illegal in most international waters -- yacht crews favor the use of non-lethal weapons for security. This has fueled the recent market boom for weapons like SeaLase, according to Buchter. SeaLase is the latest of these kinds of weapons, which include ""L-Rad,"" a long-range acoustic device that temporarily deafens enemies and the $450,000 ""SeaOwl"" tracking system, which combines radar and infrared or thermal cameras to detect incoming threats as far as five kilometers away. BAE Systems, the world's second largest global defense company, is thinking even bigger with plans for a sophisticated electronic early warning system for supertankers that some experts say could cost several million dollars. ""Piracy is on the rise,"" said Nick Stoppard of BAE systems. ""Attacks in 2008 were double those of the previous year and there is a clear need for better methods to help commercial ships identify and evade pirates before an attack occurs."" The early warning system would use extremely advanced radars that could see over the horizon, as far as 25 km away. But pirates are not the only enemies of affluent yacht owners. For some, the paparazzi, using long range lens to take pictures of them on their yachts, can pose a privacy headache. According to reports in UK newspaper,  The Times, Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich has installed an ""anti-pap system"" that would fire light beams at a camera, disrupting its ability to take images. Aside from the anti-pap system, it has been widely reported that Abramovitch's yacht ""Eclipse"" carries an anti-missile defense system and an escape submarine. The yacht is also said to have doubled in price to $1.2 billion since its commissioning three years ago. Michael Howorth, former super-yacht captain and technical editor at SuperYachtWorld magazine, told CNN for a previous article: As a yacht owner, ""you would be an absolute fool if you didn't have this sort of advanced defense technology.","Lasers that blind pirates are now available to wealthy super-yacht owners .
The lasers only temporarily impair eye-sight and make the assailant nauseous .
Systems such as SeaLase are on the increase with growing piracy figures ."
"(CNN) -- Las Vegas police caught two people as they were about to board a plane for Colombia, then charged them with the murder of a woman who went missing hours after being dropped off for a cosmetic surgery procedure. The female victim was dropped off Saturday morning to undergo a cosmetic procedure, according to a statement from the Las Vegas Police Department. The victim's daughter contacted police after she was unable to find her mother at the same location where she had dropped her off about eight hours earlier. A police report, obtained and posted online by CNN affiliate KLAS, quoted the daughter as saying the office did not even have the same furniture in the office as was there earlier in the day. The report claims that, before she left originally, the daughter saw the victim, identified as 42-year-old Elena Caro, disrobe and be injected in the buttocks by a man later identified by the daughter as one of the suspects, Ruben Dario Mattallana-Galvas. The daughter told police she got a call about an hour later from her mother, and was told to return several hours later. In that span, authorities learned that the woman had been picked up in an ambulance about three miles north from the original location and taken to a local hospital. There, she was pronounced dead, according to the police statement. Las Vegas police detectives soon identified two suspects as Mattallana-Galvas, 55, and Carmen Olfidia Torres-Sanchez, 47. Both are from Medellin, Colombia. The pair were arrested Saturday night at McCarran International Airport, while preparing to board a flight for Colombia. The pair actually had tickets for April 22, but were hoping to leave the United States earlier, according to the police report. Instead, they were taken to the Clark County Detention Center and each charged with one count of murder, police said. Mattallana-Galvas and Torres-Sanchez are due to be formally arraigned in court Tuesday on the charges, according to Las Vegas police. After being informed he was being arrested for murder and being read his Miranda rights, Mattallana-Galvas told detectives that Caro had come into his office that day for a buttocks enhancement procedure, the police report stated. He claimed that, afterward, Caro had walked away from his office. Mattallana-Galvas admitted to authorities that he was not licensed to pr active medicine in  Nevada, but claimed he was a homeopathic doctor in Colombia. Also Saturday, Las Vegas detectives interviewed an assistant to Mattallana-Galvas, who claimed that Mattallana-Galvas told her to cancel his appointments for that afternoon because ""something had gone wrong,"" the police report said. The assistant said that her husband eventually took Mattallana-Galvas to the airport. The  toxicology report examining the exact cause and timing of Caro's death  is still pending, John Fudenberg, the assistant coroner for Clark  County, said Monday evening.

"(CNN) -- Bayern Munich climbed to third place in the Bundesliga on Saturday with a 4-0 victory over Hoffenheim. Luis Van Gaal's team started brightly and took the lead after two minutes through Germany striker Mario Gomez, who scored his 17th league goal of the season. Gomez's compatriot Thomas Muller doubled the reigning champions' advantage with only 15 minutes gone when he fired home from inside the box after a pass from Franck Ribery. Dutch winger Arjen Robben netted a brace in only his fourth game of the season to seal a comprehensive victory. The win sees the 2010 double winners move ahead of Mainz and Hannover who are both in action on Sunday. League-leaders Borussia Dortmund were held to a 1-1 draw away to Kaiserslautern after having defender Neven Subotic sent off. Jurgen Klopp's team looked to have secured an away victory when Sven Bender put them ahead with nine minutes left, but Subotic picked up his second yellow card four minutes later. With the match entering stoppage time, striker Jan Moravek fired home from the edge of the penalty area to rescue a point for Kaiserlautern. Despite the setback, Dortmund still hold a 10-point lead over second-placed Bayer Leverkusen and are still well-placed to secure their first league championship since 2002. Leverkusen picked up three points after they earned a 3-0 victory away to Eintracht Frankfurt. German international Simon Rolfes put Leverkusen ahead in the ninth minute when he fired a left-footed shot past Frankfurt goalkeeper Ola Nikolov. Rolfes' center-midfield partner Renato Augusto made it 2-0 after 32 minutes, before substitute Hanno Balitsch made sure of the win with a third for Jupp Heynckes' side in the 81st minute. Mid-table Frankfurt have now failed to find the net in their last five Bundesliga outings. Hamburg moved up to seventh position in the table with a 1-0 win over struggling Wolfsburg. A goal from Croatia forward Mladen Petric was enough to defeat Wolfsburg, who recently sacked English coach Steve McLaren. Nuremberg remain in ninth place after a convincing 4-1 defeat at relegation-threatened Stuttgart. Goals from Timmy Simons and Julian Schieber gave Nuremberg a two-goal lead inside 29 minutes, before Patrick Funk reduced Stuttgart's arrears on the stroke of half time. Jens Hegeler and Mehmet Ekici made sure of victory for Nuremberg in the second half to leave Stuttgart languishing in 17th position. Elsewhere, Jefferson Farfan's strike was enough to secure a 1-0 success for Schalke over Freiburg and FC St Pauli scored a 3-1 win at home to Borussia Monchengladbach.","Bayern Munich are third in the Bundesliga after a 4-0 win over Hoffenheim .

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- The commander of U.S. and NATO-led forces in Afghanistan apologized Wednesday after an investigation concluded that coalition troops accidentally killed nine civilians -- including some children -- in a strike Tuesday. Gen. David Petraeus, commander of the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force (ISAF), said he would personally apologize to Afghan President Hamid Karzai after Karzai returns from a trip to London this week. ""We are deeply sorry for this tragedy and apologize to the members of the Afghan government, the people of Afghanistan, and, most importantly, the surviving family members of those killed by our actions,"" Petraeus said in a statement Wednesday. Some children were among the dead, an ISAF spokesman said. Preliminary findings of an investigation show that ISAF forces accidentally killed nine civilians in the Darah-Ye Pech district of Afghanistan's eastern Kunar province Tuesday, the statement said. The incident happened after insurgents fired rockets at a base used by U.S. and allied troops. ""These deaths should never have happened..."" Petraeus said. ""Regrettably, there appears to have been an error in the hand-off between identifying the location of the insurgents and the attack helicopters that carried out the subsequent operations."" In a statement Wednesday, Karzai condemned the incident ""in the strongest terms possible."" He noted the incident occurred less than 10 days after another incident ""that left many civilians dead in the same province."" On February 20, Kunar provincial Governor Sayed Fazlullah Wahidi said 64 civilians had died in a joint operation by ISAF and Afghan security forces over several days. The dead included 20 women and 15 children, he said. Karzai said the children were collecting firewood when they were killed. Karzai emphasized Wednesday that ""NATO needs to focus on the safe havens of terrorists,"" adding that killing innocent civilians will create ""huge problems."" Civilian casualties have been a hot-button issue in Afghanistan and have hurt the coalition's efforts to win backing for its efforts. Petraeus recently directed military commanders in Afghanistan to review changes meant to minimize civilian casualties. He has ordered commanders to brief helicopter attack crews again on the changes, he said. Should the facts of the investigation warrant it, he said, the military could take disciplinary action against some of the troops involved.

"(CNN) -- Jenson Button fears the weather could have a huge impact on the Malaysian Grand Prix as his McLaren team try to haul back Red Bull's lightning start to the season. Button emerged victorious at the Sepang circuit in 2009 when the race had to be cut short due to torrential rain, and he went on to clinch the drivers' championship at the end of that campaign. The British McLaren driver finished sixth in the season-opener in Melbourne two weeks ago, as reigning world champion Sebastian Vettel drove from pole to flag to secure an impressive victory for Red Bull. And Button thinks whoever handles the inclement weather best in Asia will stand a good chance of claiming the checkered flag. He told Formula One's official website: ""It is a fun place to race and the weather can really play a big part here, especially with the four o'clock start, it is pretty much on the dot when it starts raining. ""It makes it tricky for every team in the pit-lane and every driver to really understand the conditions and to make the right call."" Only 33 laps were possible when Button won in 2009 as thunderstorms and failing light made racing too dangerous. Drivers also have to contend with the humidity in Malaysia and Button has been training in Hawaii for the past week to prepare for the tough conditions. He told British newspaper The Daily Telegraph: ""With the heat and humidity, and with it being a very tough circuit on tires, then we are going to see a very different race to the last one in Melbourne. ""Then you chuck the weather into it and it's going to be absolute madness. It will still be good, and we're all looking forward to it because you never really know what's going to happen."" Button might well have improved on his sixth place in Melbourne but for a tussle with Ferrari's Felipe Massa, which resulted in a drive through penalty after he overtook the Brazilian illegally. But the 31-year-old thinks overtaking will be far easier in Malaysia, with the help of the Drag Reductions System (which helps cars boost speed in passing situations). He said: ""It is one of those circuits where you can really have a good tussle as corners flow into each other. I think with the DRS it is going to make overtaking a lot easier than it was in Melbourne.""","Jenson Button says the weather could play a big part at the Malaysian Grand Prix .

"(CNN) -- Real Madrid kept the pressure on Spanish leaders Barcelona with a 2-1 victory in the capital derby against Atletico on Saturday. Barcelona earlier defeated Getafe by the same scoreline to move eight points clear at the top, but Jose Mourinho's men responded by beating Atletico for the fourth time this season. Karim Benzema continued his recent hot scoring run to put Real ahead in the 11th minute at the Vicente Calderon, with the France forward netting for the eighth time in five games after a clever stabbed pass from Sami Khedira. Khedira's fellow Germany midfielder Mesut Ozil made it 2-0 in the 32nd minute with his sixth La Liga goal this season, sidefooting a powerful left-foot effort from Marcelino's left-wing cutback that Atletico keeper David de Gea could only help into the net. The lead at times flattered Real, who needed a string of fine saves from goalkeeper Iker Casillas to keep Atletico at bay. Striker Sergio Aguero finally scored a deserved goal in the 86th minute after a well-worked one-two with Koke inside the penalty area, but Atletico did not seriously threaten again in the three minutes of time added on. It capped a fine week for Mourinho, who guided Real into the quarterfinals of the European Champions League for the first time since 2004, with a tie against England's Tottenham awaiting. Barcelona are also through to the last eight of that competition, facing Ukraine's Shakhtar Donetsk with the winner to play either Real or Spurs in the semis. Pep Guardiola's team went into the home match against Getafe without veteran French defender Eric Abidal, who had an operation to remove a liver tumor last Thursday, plus captain Carles Puyol, winger Pedro and Maxwell. But with the likes of Lionel Messi and David Villa in the line-up, the Catalans always had too much firepower against a team which has slumped out of European qualification contention. That star duo did not add to their formidable goal tally this season, as Brazil fullback Dani Alves broke the deadlock in the 17th minute with a fierce half-volley from outside the penalty area. Villa was booked for diving before halftime, then Messi helped 20-year-old Bojan Krkic make it 2-0 four minutes after the break with a low shot that took a huge deflection. It was Krkic's 100th La Liga outing for Barcelona, and featured his second successive goal and sixth of the campaign. With Barca coasting, Getafe gave the home fans a late scare when Manu del Moral volleyed home a cross in the 87th minute. In Saturday's other game, Real Mallorca moved up to ninth place with a 1-0 win at home to Real Zaragoza, who remained four points above the bottom three. In Italy, Serie A leaders AC Milan suffered a shock 1-0 defeat at Sicilian club Palermo on Saturday. Defender Dorin Goian's 11th-minute winner gave defending champions Inter Milan the chance to close to within two points of their city rivals by beating lowly Lecce on Sunday. Third-placed Napoli can cut Milan's lead to three points by beating Cagliari in Sunday's late match. In Saturday's other game, Lazio moved back into fourth place with a 1-0 win at home to struggling Cesena thanks to a second-minute goal from striker Mauro Zarate.","Barcelona remain five points clear of Real Madrid after both teams win on Saturday .

"(CNN) -- A satellite surveillance project spearheaded by actor George Clooney's organization will monitor violence in Sudan during a January vote that could split the country in two. The program will use satellite images to assess the situation on the ground for any signs of conflict, monitor hotspots in real time and post the findings online, organizers said. The satellites can help capture threats to civilians, keep track of displaced people and inspect razed villages, the organizers said in a statement. ""We want to cast a spotlight -- literally -- on the hotspots along the border to record any actions that might escalate the chances of conflict,"" the statement said. ""We hope that if many eyes are on the potential spoilers, we can all help detect, deter and interdict actions that could lead to a return to deadly violence."" Clooney said in the statement the program will help avert crime. ""We want to let potential perpetrators of genocide and other war crimes know that we're watching, the world is watching,"" he said. ""War criminals thrive in the dark. It's a lot harder to commit mass atrocities in the glare of the media spotlight."" Humanitarian agencies hope the alert system will prevent human rights violations in a country where attacks in the western Darfur region have killed hundreds of thousands in the past seven years. Not On Our Watch, an organization co-founded by Clooney that focuses on Darfur, is funding the satellite effort. It is collaborating with other groups, including the United Nations, Google and the Harvard Humanitarian Initiative, organizers said. The January referendum, which will determine whether southern Sudan will become an independent state, has sparked fears of renewed  violence. The vote is part of a 2005 peace agreement that ended two decades of violence between the north and oil-rich south. The conflict led to the deaths of 2 million people, many from starvation. The program, dubbed the Satellite Sentinel Project, launched Wednesday at www.satsentinel.org. The United Nations' Operational Satellite Applications Programme  -- which is part of the effort -- said it is ensuring its ""capabilities for satellite analysis and geographic information"" are utilized to avoid another humanitarian crisis.","The effort will help reduce violence during the January referendum, organizers say .

THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED. CARL AZUZ, CNN STUDENT NEWS ANCHOR: Oh say can you see a new edition of CNN Student News? 'Cause it starts right now! From the CNN Center in Atlanta, I'm Carl Azuz. First Up: Frankfurt Shooting . AZUZ: First up, President Obama says the U.S. will spare no effort to learn how an outrageous attack took place. Happened yesterday at Germany's Frankfurt Airport. Two American troops were shot and killed on a U.S. military bus. Two others were wounded. They were security forces who were being deployed. German police have one suspect in custody. Officials say that what they think happened is that the gunman rushed onto the bus while it was waiting outside the terminal and then started shooting. This would be a federal crime in both the United States and in Germany. This story was developing when we produced this show yesterday. For the latest: CNN.com. Crisis in Libya . AZUZ: The fighting between Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi's troops and the rebels who are against Colonel Gadhafi is getting worse. Libyan aircraft bombed two parts of the country yesterday where rebels have taken control. In this incident that you're watching, a CNN crew saw an aircraft drop two bombs near a town that has major oil and natural gas facilities. U.S. officials say one option to try and push Gadhafi out of power is to create a no-fly zone over Libya. Defense Secretary Robert Gates says if Congress orders that, the U.S. military could do it. But he warned lawmakers that in order to set up the no-fly zone, first, the U.S. would have to attack Libya's anti-aircraft weapons. Shoutout . JOHN LISK, CNN STUDENT NEWS: Today's first Shoutout goes out to Mr. Brown's global studies classes at Goodrell Middle School in Des Moines, Iowa! Which of these documents discusses freedom of speech? Is it the: A) Declaration of Independence, B) Preamble to the Constitution, C) Gettysburg Address or D) Bill of Rights? You've got three seconds -- GO! Freedom of speech is found in the Bill of Rights. That's your answer and that's your Shoutout! Free Speech Decision . AZUZ: The First Amendment, to be specific. People have the right to exercise their freedom of speech, even if what they're saying is hurtful. That's the ruling that the U.S. Supreme Court made yesterday in a case about the balance between free speech and privacy. On one side was the Westboro Baptist Church. They believe that God is punishing America for ""the sin of homosexuality."" And they think that U.S. troops deserve to die because they fight for a country that tolerates homosexuality. Church members have raised controversy by protesting near funerals for members of the military. That includes the 2006 funeral for Lance Corporal Matthew Snyder. Matthew's father Albert -- who says his son was not gay -- is on the other side of this court case. He says the protesters shouldn't have been at the funeral, and he sued the church for invasion of privacy. The case made it all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court. And in an 8-1 decision, the court ruled in favor of the Westboro Church and said members had a right to promote their message in public settings. Chief Justice John Roberts wrote that, ""Speech is powerful. It can stir people to action, move them to tears of both joy and sorrow and -- as it did here -- inflict great pain. On the facts before us, we cannot react to that pain by punishing the speaker.""  He also pointed out that the protest happened far enough away from the memorial service that there wasn't any indication that it interfered with the funeral. But Chief Justice Roberts added that while Westboro believes that America is morally flawed, many Americans might feel the same about Westboro. Blog Promo . AZUZ: Wanna talk about this? Head to CNNStudentNews.com. We've posted this story on today's blog and we're looking for your thoughts on both the controversy itself and the Supreme Court's decision. Senate Budget Vote . AZUZ: Americans are split on the possibility of a government shutdown. According to a recent survey, 46 percent of people say a shutdown would be good because it would stop the government from going further into debt. 44 percent say it would be bad because of the federal services that would stop running. It'll be two more weeks before that possibility comes up again. Yesterday, the Senate voted to keep funding the government through March 18th. The House passed the bill the day before. And once President Obama signs the extension, it'll be law. Rodney King Anniversary . AZUZ: Many of you might not know the name Rodney King. Back in 1991, not a lot of other people did either. But that changed after something that happened twenty years ago today. King led Los Angeles police on a high speed chase. The video of what happened when he was caught got attention across the country. A man nearby took this video, which shows the police beating Rodney King. He was arrested, but later released without being charged. And a little more than a year later, four of the officers were acquitted of beating King. The ruling caused racial tensions and set off a week-long riot in L.A. that left 55 people dead. Don Lemon recently sat down with Rodney King to talk about some of the struggles he's gone through over the past two decades and what his life is like now. (BEGIN VIDEO) DON LEMON, CNN ANCHOR, CNN NEWSROOM: In the 20 years since his life was turned upside down, Rodney King has relocated to suburban Rialto, California. He's 20 years older and, according to him, a lot wiser. He admits his past is riddled with bad decisions. If you could do it all over again, what would you do? Would you go out that night? RODNEY KING, POLICE BEATING VICTIM: I would have stayed, stayed home. I think I would have stayed home. LEMON: For years after the beating, Rodney King continued to have run-ins with the law. In 1996, he was sentenced to 90 days for a hit-and-run involving his wife. He was also arrested several times on charges related to domestic abuse, drug intoxication and indecent exposure. Why, after all that, that's what people would say, especially black people, why after all that, Rodney, are you still getting in trouble? KING: I guess the trouble that they see me in is a part of my life that I'm working on. LEMON: And 20 years later, Rodney King still lives in fear. Years after the beating, you wore a vest? KING: Oh, yeah. Yeah. LEMON: Do you still wear a vest? KING: Yeah. I do. I do. LEMON: He wears a bulletproof vest in large crowds because threats against his life were all too real. The FBI once infiltrated a white supremacist plot to assasinate king. UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER: Are you constantly looking over your shoulder? KING: I never feel safe, just things that happened. When you are part of history, and it changes for the better, you got a lot of devilish people out there that don't like it. LEMON: When Rodney King had the blood on his face, that mug shot of you with the blood on your face, who was he then? KING: Oh man. A guy that was almost dead and just, like, happy to be able to still have that face, to be able to see that face. LEMON: And Rodney King now? All cleaned up, trimmed goatee, beads around his neck. Who is Rodney King now? KING: I consider myself a decent, you know, good human being. (END VIDEO) Web Promo .

THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED. JOYCE JOSEPH, CNN STUDENT NEWS ANCHOR: You're tuned in to CNN Student News, where Fridays are always awesome! Hi, everyone. Carl Azuz is off today. I'm Joyce Joseph. Let's get to the headlines. First Up: Lessons To Be Learned? JOSEPH: First up, political protests turn violent in some of the Middle Eastern nations we've been talking about these past few weeks. The U.S. government says it's ""deeply concerned"" about the crackdown on anti-government protesters in Bahrain. Yesterday, several people were killed and hundreds more were injured in fighting between protesters and security forces. In Yemen, at least 20 people were hurt when groups that support and oppose that country's government threw stones at each other yesterday. And in Libya, some web sites called for a ""Day of Rage"" Thursday. That could be a sign that anti-government protests are picking up in the country. In all of these countries protesters are calling for change. That's already happened in Egypt, where long-time President Hosni Mubarak has stepped down. Sandra Endo explains why Egypt should study history to see where things might go from here. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SANDRA ENDO, CNN CORRESPONDENT, WASHINGTON, D.C.: A revolution in Iran 32 years ago. Months of bloodshed, protest, but success: the ouster of the Shah and his oppressive government. Three decades later, a similar fight, this time powered by Egyptians. The sweet taste of victory, forcing a dictator out of office. But what's next? For Iranians, more than thirty years later, the battle for freedom still remains. Mehdi Amini was 17 years old when he took part in the Iranian revolution. He says the honeymoon was short lived after the Shah's regime was over and a repressive Islamic republic took charge. He wants Egyptians to learn from Iran's history. MEHDI AMINI, IRANIAN PROTESTER: We have Iran as a good example of the hopes that people had and what it eventually ended up being. So, I'm just hoping that they don't have the same outcome and that they should be under watch. ENDO: A big warning for Egyptians. TRITA PARSI, PRESIDENT, NATIONAL IRANIAN AMERICAN COUNCIL: It's very positive that there's so much optimism, but it should not be translated into naivety. This is where the hard work begins, to ensure that getting rid of a dictatorial system actually translates into achieving democracy. And that's a very, very hard path that the Egyptians will walk. But hopefully, they will be more successful than the Iranians were in 1979. ENDO: For Iranians like Amini, their fight will continue. AMINI: I hope to see a day where I can go and vote freely for someone who I choose. I hope to see a day when women and men have the right to just, basically, walk with each other, not be fearful of the repercussions of what's going to happen. And I hope to see, basically, a day when I can go back to my country. ENDO: Sandra Endo, CNN, Washington . (END VIDEO CLIP) This Day In History . JOSEPH: It's February 18th, and on this day in history... In 1861, Jefferson Davis became the president of the Confederate States of America. The Confederacy ended with its loss in the U.S. Civil War. In 1930, Pluto was discovered by an astronomer at an observatory in Arizona. It was once thought to be the solar system's 9th planet, but Pluto was downgraded in 2006. And in 2001, NASCAR legend Dale Earnhardt Sr., ""The Intimidator,"" was killed in a car crash during the last lap of the Daytona 500. Stimulus: Two Years Later . JOSEPH: It didn't happen on this day in history, but two years ago yesterday, President Obama signed the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act into law. Most of us know it better as the stimulus bill. This law, which had a final price tag of $814 billion, caused a huge controversy. It was designed to give the U.S. economy a jump start, but Democrats and Republicans disagreed about whether or not it would work. Two years later, they still disagree. President Obama's administration says the stimulus has helped save more than 3 million jobs and kept the country from suffering another depression. Republicans say the stimulus hasn't created the kind of recovery that the president promised it would. As part of their argument, Republicans point to the country's unemployment rate. It's gone down recently, but it's higher now than when the stimulus bill was signed. Some experts say it's hard to judge the success of the stimulus because more than a third of the money from it hasn't even been spent yet. Shoutout .

Fredricka Whitfield shows us how a special book helped people travel safely around the country. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) FREDRICKA WHITFIELD, CNN ANCHOR, CNN NEWSROOM: The pictures on his wall are from 50 years ago, but Ernest Green remembers it like yesterday. Green was one of the Little Rock 9, a group of African-American students who enrolled in Central High School in the Arkansas capital in 1957. While Green was making history in the schools, his family navigated the segregated roads using a little-known guide for African-American families. ERNEST GREEN, LITTLE ROCK NINE: The Green Book was a, I think an institution in black life. It was one of those unknown survival tools for black people that had to move around the country. I was a teenager, so I knew that the Green Book was a necessity for us to have a place to stay. WHITFIELD: A place to stay, a place to eat, even a car repair shop that would be friendly to blacks, all pulled together in this directory. GREEN: I had had a personal experience with the Green Book. My aunt and mother mapping out a program for us to travel from Little Rock to Hampton, Virginia for my sister's graduation. WHITFIELD: Personal tales like this inspired the playwright, and he learned about the travel guide's 1936 genesis. CALVIN RAMSEY, PLAYWRIGHT, AUTHOR, ""RUTH AND THE GREEN BOOK"": Well, Victor Green, an African-American gentleman who had traveled himself and had hardships on the road, embarrassment, embarrassing situations that he didn't want to see his people continue to have. So he said, ""If I can do something about this, I will."" WHITFIELD: The idea took off. And year after year, the Green Book grew, providing resources for all 50 states. Today, Ramsey takes his children's book, ""Ruth and the Green Book,"" to elementary schools, bringing old tales to a new audience. And in the process, picking up on a dream that the creator of the Green Book held dearly. GREEN: Travel, exposure, knowledge, all of it is fatal to prejudice. It requires people to think broader to this idea about universality that begins to see people as people. WHITFIELD: Big lessons from the little guide that history almost forgot.

"(CNN) -- Conflicting reports hit the international media this week about whether Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi was negotiating a deal with the opposition for a guaranteed safe exit if he relinquished power. Speculation percolated again Wednesday after few details were available about a private Libyan aircraft that landed in Cairo, Egypt. But two questions remain: Will Gadhafi ever step down, and if he did, where would he go? Gadhafi is sure not to go down easily. He has defiantly vowed to die a martyr on Libyan soil and declared on state television, ""I am Libya."" At the moment, he has leverage, said David Pollock, a senior fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. Those who have studied the strongman's megalomanic ways agree that he would probably not retreat from his revolution or his country without a fight to the end. Analysts have raised the grim prospect of a protracted, bloody war in the vein of Somalia. ""The tipping point wasn't reached quickly enough,"" Pollock said. ""Now, this has turned into something that got stuck. It's grim. Very grim."" But if it came to a do-or-die scenario, Gadhafi, despite his bravado, would look for a way out, Pollock said. There is no possibility of power-sharing, so if the opposition were to oust him, Gadhafi would have to leave the country, as U.S. President Barack Obama and others have already urged him to do. But few would be willing to welcome a man with such a tarnished reputation, reinforced in recent weeks by the bloody crackdown on unarmed protesters, analysts said. Saudi Arabia's name pops up in discussions of this nature; after all, Tunisia's ousted President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali fled into exile in the Gulf kingdom. And there were rumors at one time that Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak would do the same. But Gadhafi is another matter. His relationship with Saudi King Abdullah is, to put it mildly, strained, especially after the Saudis accused Libyans of an assassination attempt on the king several years back. ""I would be extremely surprised if he went to Saudi Arabia,"" said Christopher Boucek, a Saudi Arabia expert at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. Boucek suggested that Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe might be more amenable to taking in Gadhafi. The Libyan leader's adoption of pan-African solidarity drew him closer to the Zimbabwean dictator. The relationship between the two nations blossomed also from the leaders' shared anti-colonial fervor and a realpolitik bond of being isolated nations, according to Boucek. Others have suggested that Gadhafi could find a home in Cuba or Venezuela. President Hugo Chavez of Venezuela is considered Gadhafi's main ally in Latin America, a love born, again, from a mutual distaste for Western ""imperialism."" When the uprising began to escalate in Libya last month, rumors surfaced that Gadhafi had already fled to Caracas, the Venezuelan capital. Pollock listed one more possible future home for the Libyan strongman: Sudan. Reva Bhalla, an analyst with the global intelligence company Stratfor, said Gadhafi has reportedly sought friendship from Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad and tried to shore up that alliance. But even the Syrians, said Bhalla, are less than enthused. European nations, Bhalla said, would suit Gadhafi's sons just fine but not the eccentric leader, who has been famously known to travel with female bodyguards and sleep under a tent, even when he came to New York to address the United Nations. After all, she said, Gadhafi remains a hardcore Bedouin. And for the moment, it seems, he will remain in his Bedouin homeland, unwilling to let go of 40 years of power.","There has been speculation about Gadhafi making an exit deal .
But the strongman appears as defiant as ever .
If he were to flee, he would have few options on where to go .

"Beijing (CNN) -- Holding back tears of nervousness, Zeng Yuhan accepted China's first peace prize Thursday at a hotel conference room in Beijing, a day before the Norwegian Nobel committee honors imprisoned Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo as this year's peace laureate in Oslo. The six-year-old local girl received a trophy and a certificate in front of a sea of television cameras from the organizers of the Confucius Peace Prize, which also comes with an award of $15,000. The ceremony's hosts said Zeng was chosen to accept the award on behalf of Lien Chan, the real winner and Taiwan's former vice president, because ""children symbolize peace and future."" Members of the prize jury said Lien, who they deemed had made major contributions to bridging the gap between Taiwan and mainland China, could not attend the event for ""reasons known to everyone"" -- but apparently not to the recipient himself. ""We know who Confucius is, but don't know anything about this prize,"" Ting Yuan-chao, director of Lien's office in Taipei, told CNN earlier. The hour-long award ceremony and press conference appeared thrown together at the last minute, jarred by microphone malfunction, awkward moments of silence and egregious English interpretation errors. None of these factors seemed to have deterred the organizers, who promised to make this an annual event. Brushing aside suggestions that their prize was meant to counter the Nobel award, the head of the jury insisted their focus to be promoting the ancient Chinese sage's philosophy. ""China is a great nation that has been influenced by the Confucian concept of peace for a long time,"" Tan Changliu, chairman of the prize committee, told CNN before the ceremony. ""We want to promote world peace from an Eastern perspective."" ""Europe is full of small countries that had fought each other for centuries,"" he added. ""We don't want to see people who don't understand peace to ruin the concept."" Other members of the jury launched tirades against the United States, accusing it of destabilizing northeast Asia for staging war games in the region amid current tensions on the Korean Peninsula. Tan declined to give details about his group -- other than stressing it is a non-government organization and the prize money came from an anonymous donor -- or how the five judges selected the nominees and the eventual winner. Candidates for this year's Confucius prize included Nelson Mandela, Jimmy Carter, Bill Gates and the Panchen Lama, a Tibetan Buddhist leader loyal to Beijing. Of the eight nominees, only a Chinese poet, Qiao Damo, showed up and said it was a great honor to be chosen along with the other men. China has responded furiously since the Nobel committee announced its decision on October 8. Officials have repeatedly called Liu -- currently serving an 11-year sentence for ""inciting subversion"" -- a common criminal and the award a Western plot against China. A businessman first proposed a rival peace prize in a commentary on the November 17 edition of Global Times, an English-language newspaper published by the Communist Party mouthpiece People's Daily. Echoing government spokesmen, Liu Zhiqin said that by awarding the prize to a criminal, the Nobel committee created 1.3 billion ""dissidents"" in China. ""We often stress the need to fight for the right to speak,"" he wrote. ""China's civil society should consider setting up a 'Confucius Peace Prize'... to declare China's view on peace and human rights to the world."" The U.S. House of Representatives Wednesday overwhelmingly passed a non-binding resolution to praise Liu Xiaobo, prompting strong condemnation from Beijing. ""We urge relevant U.S. lawmakers to realize their mistake, change their arrogant and unreasonable attitude and show respect for the Chinese people and national sovereignty,"" said Jiang Yu, a foreign ministry spokeswoman. Back at the Confucius award ceremony, organizers refused to say if they will watch Friday's Nobel event. Despite the perceived rivalry between the two peace prizes, they seem to have one important thing in common -- the absence of their recipients at this year's award ceremonies.","A six-year-old girl accepted the award for Lien Chan, Taiwan's former vice president .

"(CNN) -- The death toll from the latest round of heavy rain and flooding in central Vietnam continues to soar, with 46 people killed and 21 missing, state-run media report. Rescuers were able to save 18 people whose bus was swept away Monday on the north-south highway 1A through Ha Tinh Province, but 19 people remain unaccounted for, according to VietNamNet. The homes of 200,000 people are underwater in Nghe An, Ha Tinh and Quang Bing provinces because of floods caused by storms that began October 14, official media report. On Sunday alone, about 30 inches of rain fell in parts of the country. The storms have hit the southeast Asian nation's agricultural sector hard, with waters inundating 8,000 hectares (31 square miles) of rice fields. Prices of some crops have increased 200 to 500 percent as a result. This storm follows rains and floods at the beginning of October in Nghe An, Ha Tinh, Quang Bing, Quang Tri and Thua Thien provinces that caused an estimated $137.5 million in damage, according to VietNamNet. The two rounds of flood calamities have contributed to the deaths of 112 people, reported state-run television network VTV4, which cited Vietnam's Central Steering Committee for Flood and Storm Control as its source. The Vietnamese government has dispatched 20,000 troops to help with the rescue and recovery process in the latest flooding, with Red Cross staffers from Vietnam, Spain, China, Germany and the United States among those helping the cause, reported VietNamNet. The number of fatalities has climbed significantly in recent days. On Monday, state-run media were reporting that at least 20 people had died. A flood and landslide warning remains in effect for much of the region, with water levels dangerously high in the Ca River in Nghe An province and the Ngan Sau River in Ha Tinh province. Landslides have already dumped tons of dirt and debris, clogging the Pe Ke mountain pass and parts of the Ho Chi Minh Highway. And the situation might get worse, as Typhoon Megi, also known as Typhoon Juan, barrels across the South China Sea after killing 11 people in the Philippines. Besides rain, the National Centre for Hydrometeorological Forecasting forecasts strong winds, big waves and rough seas over the next several days.","Landslides and flooding leave 46 dead, 21 missing in central Vietnam .

"(CNN) -- A Reno, Nevada, man is charged with four counts of murder in the deaths of four northern California women dating back more than three decades, authorities said Tuesday. Joseph Naso, 77, was arrested Monday by Marin County, California, detectives following his release from the El Dorado County jail, also in California, where he had been in custody over the past year on unrelated charges, Marin County District Attorney Ed Berberian told reporters. Naso is charged in the 1977 murder of Roxene Roggash in Marin County; Pamela Parsons and Tracy Tofoya of Yuba County, California, whose bodies were found in 1993 and 1994, respectively; and the death of Carmen Colon in Contra Costa County, California, whose body was found in 1978, Berberian said. He is eligible for the death penalty. Nancy Grace's Cold Cases . Roggash's murder was considered unsolved until Naso was arrested in April 2010 by Nevada parole and probation authorities, Berberian said. During that arrest, police found items that implicated Naso ""in multiple murders of young women,"" he said. CNN affiliate KGO said Naso, who had been convicted of grand theft at a grocery store, had a probation officer visit him at his home near Reno and found weapons. Naso spent a year in the El Dorado County Jail for the violation and was arrested upon his departure Monday, KGO said. A search of his home turned up photographs and writings tying him to the deaths, according to the station. Berberian was tightlipped about details Tuesday, citing the ongoing investigation. He said Marin County has agreed to prosecute Naso for all four murders. Naso's arraignment is scheduled for Wednesday afternoon, Berberian said, and he will be presented with a criminal complaint at the hearing. He was being held without bail in the Marin County Jail on Tuesday, Berberian said. Although authorities have yet to link Naso to any slayings in Nevada, Chris Perry, acting director of the Nevada Department of Public Safety, left open the possibility of more victims. ""We're hoping that people who have missing relatives will take a look at this and maybe put a couple of the pieces together and get that information to us so we can follow up on it,"" he told reporters.

"(CNN) -- Barcelona have maintained their eight-point lead at the top of La Liga with a 3-1 victory over bottom-placed Almeria at the Nou Camp. The visitors took a shock lead five minutes into the second half when Miguel Angel Corona finished off a counter attack. But the hosts were back on level terms almost immediately as Almeria goalkeeper Diego Alves brought down David Villa with Lionel Messi converting the resulting spot kick. Barcelona did have to wait long for their second as Thiago Alcantara gave them the lead in the 64th minute, and Messi wrapped things up with his second goal, capitalizing on some sloppy defending in injury time. Real Madrid enjoyed a comfortable 3-0 victory over Athletic Bilbao to put their title challenge back on track after the shock defeat to Sporting Gijon last weekend. Two penalties from Kaka -- one in each half -- and a 70th minute strike from Cristiano Ronaldo -- his 28th league goal of the campaign -- ensured Jose Mourinho's team remain within striking distance of the Spanish champions who visit the Bernabeu next weekend. Meanwhile in Serie A, Inter Milan kept up the pressure on leaders AC Milan on Saturday night with a 2-0 win over Chievo at the San Siro. Second-half goals from Esteban Cambiasso in the 66th minute and Maicon six minutes from time saw Inter take all three points to move ahead of Napoli who play Bologna on Sunday. The win also moves them to within two points of Milan, who face Fiorentina on Sunday evening. In Serie A's only other Saturday tie, Roma moved to within one point of fifth-placed Lazio, with a 2-1 victory over fourth-placed Udinese at the Stadio Friuli. The win puts Vincenzo Montella's side back in contention for the fourth Champions League place. Lazio play Parma on Sunday.","Two goals from Lionel Messi help Barcelona to a 3-1 win over Almeria .

"(CNN) -- A doctor at a Pennsylvania weight-loss clinic is scheduled for a preliminary hearing next week on charges that he sexually assaulted at least six female patients, according to the criminal complaint from the Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, district attorney's office. Dr. Arie Oren, 64, is charged with multiple counts of aggravated  indecent assault and indecent assault that allegedly occurred during  patient visits at the Conshohocken Weight Control clinic between the  spring of 2008 through November 2010, the complaint said. Conshohocken is  a suburb of Philadelphia. Oren was formally charged earlier this week, with allegations in the district attorney's criminal complaint including that he told several patients that an orgasm would help them burn calories. The six female victims listed in the affidavit, who range in age from 24 to 59, described similar experiences with Oren at the clinic.  The victims told prosecutors they were all touched inappropriately or groped and he allegedly penetrated most of the victims' genitals with an electronic massager as an excuse to ""break up the fat."" One victim recounted that after Oren used the massager and touched her below the waist, he said, ""You know, if you have an orgasm you will burn 200 calories,"" according to the document. Another victim claimed that Oren tried to kiss her after assaulting her and said that the visit was free because she was ""so hot,"" the complaint said. Oren has a valid medical license that expires in December 2012, according to Pennsylvania's Department of State website. Efforts by CNN to reach Oren on Tuesday evening were not successful and a person who answered the phone at the Conshohocken Weight Control clinic said personnel there were not commenting on the case. Efforts to reach an attorney reported to be representing Oren also were unsuccessful. Oren is free on bail pending a preliminary hearing scheduled for April 21, according to Assistant District Attorney Kate McGill.","Pennsylvania prosecutors have charged a doctor with sexual assaulting  patients .

"(CNN) -- After a three-week trial and one hour of deliberations, an upstate New York jury on Monday found Muzzammil ""Mo"" Hassan guilty of second-degree murder for beheading his wife. In February 2009, Hassan, who founded a TV network aimed at countering Muslim stereotypes, went to a police station in the Buffalo, New York, suburb of Orchard Park and told officers his wife was dead, police have said. Aasiya Hassan had been decapitated, with prosecutor Paul Bonanno saying during opening arguments that the long knife used by her husband had left marks on his office's tile floor. Hassan gave his own closing arguments Monday. Earlier in the trial, he had dismissed his attorney, Jeremy Schwartz, who by trial's end was acting as his legal adviser. ""Mr. Hassan has felt that throughout the tenure of his marriage, no one had listened to his side,"" Schwartz told reporters after the verdict. ""It was important for him in the two hours that he had for summation to get across his side and how he saw his marriage."" Hassan listened quietly to the jury verdict, Schwartz said. Hassan has the right to appeal after he is sentenced, Schwartz said. According to prosecutors, Aasiya Hassan had filed for divorce less than a week before she died. On the day she died, Aasiya Hassan agreed to take some of her husband's clothes to his office after he had moved out of their home. He had told her he would not be there, prosecutors said. ""The defendant viciously killed ... and desecrated her (Aasiya's) body because six days earlier she had dared to file for divorce. Dared to seek a better life for herself and the children,"" Assistant District Attorney Paul Bonanno said in the prosecution's opening statement. Schwartz, then his client's defense lawyer, said in his opening statement that the couple's marriage was a ""sad and unhealthy relationship"" and that Aasiya Hassan threatened to embarrass his client and take away his children. ""It ended with 'Mo' Hassan in fear of his very life,"" he told jurors. ""Mo Hassan killed his wife, but he is not guilty of murder in the second degree."" During the trial, Michael and Sonia Hassan testified that their father had become violent in the past, CNN affiliate WIVB in Buffalo reported. While both said the couple argued, neither recalled a case in which Aasiya -- their stepmother -- instigated a fight. Police earlier said they had responded to several domestic violence calls at the couple's home, but no one had ever been arrested. Hassan was the chief executive officer of the network Bridges TV, and Aasiya Hassan was the general manager. He launched Bridges TV, billed as the first English-language cable channel targeting Muslims inside the United States, in 2004. At the time, Hassan said he hoped the network would balance negative portrayals of Muslims following the attacks of September 11, 2001. Hassan fired three defense attorneys before the trial. Schwartz was the fourth to be dismissed, though he stayed as an adviser.","A New York jury finds Muzzammil ""Mo"" Hassan guilty of second-degree murder .

"Washington (CNN) -- The latest assessment of human rights by the United States is critical of the records of Middle Eastern governments, including those of allies like Saudi Arabia and Bahrain, and adds that it will take ""years"" before the impact of the wave of unrest across the region is understood. In a gripping introduction to its 2010 Human Rights Report released Friday, the State Department said, ""Because we are publishing this report three months into the new year... our perspectives on many issues are now framed by the dramatic changes sweeping across countries in the Middle East in 2011."" ""At this moment,"" it said, ""we cannot predict the outcome of these changes, and we will not know the lasting impacts for years to come."" The detailed report chronicles human rights conditions in 194 countries but it focuses significant attention on events in the Middle East and North Africa. No ""sweeping analysis"" of the entire region is possible, it said, because the internal dynamics of each country are different. But, singling out Tunisia, which sparked the so-called ""Arab Spring"" and Egypt, which threw out one of the most powerful leaders in the region, the report says, ""We are witnessing popular demands for meaningful political participation, fundamental freedoms, and greater economic opportunity."" ""These demands are profound, they are homegrown, and they are being driven by new activists, many of them young people. These citizens seek to build sustainable democracies in their countries with governments that respect the universal human rights of their own people. If they succeed, the Middle East region, and with it the whole world, will be improved."" The 2010 Human Rights Report lists three trends that are affecting rights around the world: . The first is the ""explosive growth"" of non-governmental advocacy organizations promoting democracy and human rights issues and causes. ""In many countries ""citizens' organizations have been created against great odds and only because individual human rights activists were willing to face great personal risk,"" it says. In the last several years, more than 90 governments have sought to pass restrictive laws and regulations hampering the ability of organizations to register, operate freely, or receive foreign funding . The second trend is the explosion of connective technologies like the internet and mobile phones. In Egypt and Tunisia, the report notes, ""while it is the courage of the people themselves that led the way and was the driving force, the amplifying impact of these new technologies, coupled with the power of television stations and the internet to broadcast videos obtained by citizens using these mobile phones, cannot be denied."" More than 40 governments, however, it says, now are using a combination of regulatory restrictions, technical controls on access to the internet, and technologies designed to repress speech and infringe on the personal privacy of those who use these rapidly evolving technologies. In China, for example, it says bloggers and webmasters have been arrested and charged with ""subverting state power"" for re-tweeting a post or operating a website where others posted comments. The third trend, a negative one, the State Department said, is the escalation of violence, persecution, and official and societal discrimination against members of vulnerable groups, such as racial, religious, and ethnic minorities. The discrimination extends to women, children, persons with disabilities; and lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) persons. ""In Uganda, intimidation and harassment of LGBT individuals worsened during the year,"" it said, ""and some government and religious leaders threatened LGBT individuals. Honduras saw an upsurge in killings of members of the LGBT community by unknown individuals. LIBYA . In Libya, currently in a state of civil war as its leader, Moammar Gadhafi, clings to power, the State Department said, ""Colonel al-Gadhafi and his close associates monopolized every aspect of decision-making in the government."" Read about alleged Libyan rape victim thankful for support. The Libyan government, it says, continues to use torture and arbitrary arrest. ""A large but unknown number of persons remained in detention or prison for engaging in peaceful political activity or for belonging to an illegal political organization."" SYRIA . In Syria, swept with dissent against its president, Bashar al-Assad, government security forces in 2010 committed ""unlawful killings, detained political and human rights activists, and tortured and physically abused prisoners and detainees with impunity,"" the State Department said. TUNISIA . In an update on Tunisia , however, the report is optimistic, saying the United States is ""encouraged by the creation of a fact-finding committee to investigate human rights abuses that took place during the uprising,"" it said. EGYPT . In Egypt, the State Department says the United States is ""waiting for the government to lift the state of emergency, which the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces has promised to do prior to parliamentary elections."" SAUDI ARABIA . A key U.S. ally, Saudi Arabia, comes in for criticism, with the report noting ""there were severe restrictions on religious freedom and discrimination on the basis of religion was common."" In addition, the Saudi government, it said, restricted access to the internet and interfered with citizens' privacy while online, monitoring e-mail and internet chat rooms and blocked sites, ""including pages about Hinduism, Judaism, Christianity, and certain forms of Islam deemed incompatible with Sharia law and national regulations."" BAHRAIN . In Bahrain, the report cites were ""multiple allegations of mistreatment and torture, especially of Shia activists associated with rejectionist and opposition groups. Authorities arbitrarily arrested activists, journalists, and other citizens and detained some individuals incommunicado,"" it said. Shia Muslims are underrepresented in leadership positions in the civil service, police, and security forces and citizens in general ""did not have the right to change their government."" The government restricted civil liberties, including freedoms of speech, press, assembly, association, and some religious practices, it notes. ISRAEL . In Israel, the State Department cites ""institutional, legal, and societal discrimination against Arab citizens, Palestinian residents of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, non-Orthodox Jews, and other religious groups."" It says there is societal discrimination against persons with disabilities, as well as discrimination and domestic violence against women, particularly in Bedouin society. ""While trafficking in persons for the purpose of prostitution decreased in recent years, trafficking for the purpose of labor remained a serious problem, as did abuse of foreign workers and societal discrimination and incitement against asylum seekers."" YEMEN . In Yemen, the report cites ""arbitrary and unlawful killings, politically motivated disappearances, and reports of torture and other physical abuse accompanied the use of excessive force against civilians in internal conflict. Human rights abuses included"" severe limitations on citizens' ability to change their government due to, among other factors, corruption, fraudulent voter registration, administrative weakness, and close political-military relationships at high levels. PAKISTAN . In Pakistan it cites media and non-governmental organization reports on allegations of extrajudicial killings and detention of civilians by the security forces. The total number of reported torture and rape cases of individuals in custody almost doubled, the report notes, compared to 2009. CHINA . Last year, the state of human rights in China was a hot-button issue, with charges that Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was downplaying abuses. The 2010 report says a ""negative trend in key areas of human rights continued."" The government, it said, ""stepped up restrictions on lawyers, activists, bloggers, and journalists; tightened controls on civil society; and increased attempts to limit freedom of speech and control the press, the internet, and internet access in 2010."" It notes the increased use of ""forced disappearances,"" strict house arrest, arbitrary detention in ""black jails"" and other forms of ""soft detention"" to silence independent voices and punish activists and their families. It singles out legal activist Chen Guangcheng, along with his wife and child. Chen remained under house arrest, as did other released political prisoners. RUSSIA . In Russia, the report says, the government detained demonstrators and continued to pressure non-governmental organizations, independent media, some religious minorities, independent labor unions, and political opposition. Attacks on and the murder of journalists and activists continued. BELARUS . And in Belarus, the State Department report highlights ""particularly harsh treatment"" of pro-democracy activists and journalists. More than 700 pro-democracy activists, including seven presidential candidates, were arrested during public demonstrations following the flawed December 2010 presidential elections, it says. In the weeks that followed, the offices and homes of civil society representatives, independent journalists, and political activists were raided as part of an effort to stifle expression. The State Department's Human Rights Report is translated into over 50 languages and made available online. In conjunction with the new report, State Department launched a new website called humanrights.gov.","State Department releases 2010 Human Rights Report .

"London (CNN) -- Buildings were burning at a prison in southern England on Saturday, more than 12 hours after prisoners started a riot by smashing windows and setting fires. Fires were burning in at least two buildings at HMP Ford, an open prison with numerous one-story residence halls on a grassy campus. At least one of the buildings was destroyed, according to aerial footage of the scene. Two fire engines escorted by specialist prison officers in riot gear went onto prison grounds Saturday afternoon as fires engulfed large parts of two more buildings, sending thick black smoke into the air. The Ministry of Justice said there were no reports of injuries to either prisoners or staff. The incident began around midnight (7 p.m. ET Friday) and forced prison staff to retreat. Police, firefighters and specialist teams of prison officers had to be called in. An additional 140 prison service staff arrived at Ford around midday Saturday to help bring the prison under full control, the Ministry of Justice said, emphasizing it was not an indication the situation was escalating. Ford is in a former Royal Navy station in Arundel, near the coast about two hours south of London. It was converted to a prison in 1960 and houses offenders who have fewer than two years left to serve on their sentences. Prisoners there are convicted of a variety of offenses, though the prison does not accept those convicted of arson, some sexual offenses and harassment.","Buildings are still burning 12 hours after the riot started .

"(CNN) -- An Iowa community was shut down much of Sunday afternoon while emergency crews remained hard at work, sifting through wreckage caused by a wave of powerful tornadoes that swept across the state overnight. The twisters caused major damage to about 60% of Mapleton, a city of about 1,200 residents, Monona County Sheriff Jeff Pratt told reporters Sunday. It was all part of a violent storm system that struck overnight, originating in eastern Nebraska and following a warm front across northern Iowa, according to National Weather Service meteorologist Frank Boksa. But despite causing extensive damage, it did not lead to any fatalities, said Stefanie Bond, a spokeswoman for Iowa's Homeland Security & Emergency Management Division. Wildfires in Texas | Flooding in upper Midwest . Mapleton was among the hardest-hit areas. Initially, concerns about a gas leak had prompted all nonresidents to be barred from the community, which is about 45 miles southeast of Sioux City. By 5 p.m., people were being allowed back in, though authorities remained on the scene, according to the sheriff's department. The high winds tossed cars and tractors, tore off roofs, caused a car wash to collapse, uprooted trees and downed power lines. Yet Pratt said there had been only minor injuries, giving credit to advance warning as well as an emergency response effort that included authorities both local and from elsewhere. ""There was major devastation to the southwest portion of town, but no fatalities,"" the sheriff said. Iowa Gov. Terry E. Branstad issued a disaster proclamation for Monona County, according to a statement from his office. The proclamation allows officials to use state funds to help. He later issued a similar proclamation for Pocahontas County, which also suffered severe damage. He then toured the tornado-ravaged town on Sunday afternoon, posting pictures online of uprooted trees and conversations with residents. On his Twitter page, Branstad wrote, ""Please keep the victims in your thoughts and prayers."" The twisters struck just before midnight Saturday. Amateur video recorded by storm chasers shows a large funnel cloud spinning across a flat terrain outside Mapleton. In the background, a passenger can be heard exclaiming, ""It's going to hit that town! ... Mapleton's in big trouble!"" Did you witness the storm? Share your story . Afterward, National Guard troops were brought into the area, according to Stefanie Bond, a public information officer for the state's Homeland Security & Emergency Management Division. She also said that natural gas service was temporarily shut off in the city. The Red Cross was also on the ground providing assistance. Bruce Spence, a government liaison for the group, called the damage to the town ""extensive."" ""The whole town is without power. Main Street is a disaster,"" he told CNN. ""They've shut down the town. As we speak, I'm looking down one of the residential streets. There's debris all over, trees are down. ""This isn't going to get fixed soon,"" Spence said. The National Weather Service in Des Moines, Iowa, reported tornado sightings by storm chasers and trained spotters in as many as 11 towns and cities in northern and west-central Iowa over a four-hour period Saturday night. At least three of the twisters, including the Mapleton tornado, caused significant damage, according to Boksa. In Early, a town of 1,600 residents, a tornado ripped roofs off buildings and homes and uprooted large trees, authorities said. There were no reports of injuries in that town. In Schaller, a twister knocked down a dozen trees and felled multiple power poles, the weather service reported. Tammie Pech, a Red Cross spokeswoman, said the agency was opening shelters in Mapleton and Early to take in storm victims. Only four people slept in the Mapleton shelter overnight Sunday, Spence said. Most displaced residents opted to stay with family and friends, he said. The National Weather Service also reported major damage in Nemaha, possibly from a tornado. Bond noted that strong winds also tore through hog pens in Pocohontas Country, in central Iowa, and Kossuth County, in the east along the Illinois border. Three cities in Fayette County -- Fayette, Westgate and Maynard -- were without power for about an hour Sunday evening due to a blown transformer, the state's emergency management spokeswoman said. Randy Frank, Fayette County's homeland security and emergency management coordinator, said that the challenges continued well after the tornadoes came through, with sustained winds blowing at least 50 mph into Sunday evening. ""Our biggest problem right now is fuel fires out of control,"" said Frank, whose county is about 255 miles from Monona County. ""And it's that way across the state, with the wind, which (can) be very dangerous in (fanning) the fire.""

"FORT LAUDERDALE, Florida (CNN) -- A Fort Lauderdale nurse has resigned and more than 1,800 patients have been notified that they may have been exposed to diseases such as HIV and hepatitis, after the nurse allegedly admitted to the hospital that she used disposable IV equipment on multiple patients, a violation of safety standards. Reuse of disposable equipment violates ""universal, standard"" safety policy, a hospital official noted. Fort Lauderdale Police are investigating to determine whether any crimes were committed after an anonymous caller reported seeing the nurse use the same saline bag and a portion of tubing more than once, during adult cardiac chemical stress tests. The hospital, Broward General Medical Center, said that a review of the nurse was conducted when administering intravenous fluids during the stress tests and that she was suspended pending the outcome of a full investigation. The nurse subsequently resigned, according to the hospital. Police have identified the nurse as Qui Lan of Fort Lauderdale. On Friday, an attorney for Lan told CNN: ""Ms. Qui Lan has been a registered nurse for over 37 years providing excellent medical care to all of her patients.  She has an excellent reputation in the medical community due to her professionalism and ethical manner.  We are confident that once the facts surrounding this incident are revealed, Ms. Qui Lan will continue to be seen in the same light."" ""She's not a suspect,"" said police Sgt. Frank Sousa. ""We don't have a crime at this point....If any victims come forward, we're going to investigate."" Police have not released an incident report. ""It's heartbreaking to every employee here,"" said Cathy Meyer, a spokeswoman for Broward General Medical Center. ""She was aware that she was doing this. It's no different than changing a sheet, or a BandAid. This is what nurses go into nursing school for,"" Meyer said. ""It's a violation of standard nursing infection control procedures,"" she said. ""It's a universal, standard policy which was violated."" The hospital says a review of medical files from the nurse's date of employment, January 2004, until today identified 1,851 patients to whom the nurse administered cardiac chemical tests. These patients are being urged to get tested for the hepatitis B and C virus, and HIV. Alice Taylor, the hospital's chief operating officer, said the nurse admitted to a hospital investigator that she should have used new equipment for each patient. When asked why she didn't, the nurse did not respond, Taylor said, through a spokesperson. ""She admitted to inconsistencies in replacing the saline bag,"" Taylor said. A cardiac chemical stress test is designed for people who cannot tolerate a traditional stress test, which involves walking on a treadmill with electrodes attached to their body. So, the chemical test is performed, using specific medicines that increase the heart beat as if the person were exercising. It was during this intravenous process that saline bags and tubing were allegedly used more than once, according to the anonymous individual. The hospital believes the risk of exposure is low but said it's important for patients to be tested and will pay all necessary costs. ""This is an individual's unacceptable practice that once discovered was immediately corrected,"" said James Thaw, CEO of Broward General Medical Center, in a written statement. As of Tuesday morning, the hospital had already received more than 600 calls and had counseled 30 people inside the hospital. ""It's prudent for our hospital to go into an investigation and notify every patient. We took a conservative approach,"" said Meyer, the hospital spokesperson. But whether the nurse's actions result in criminal charges remains to be seen. The police have sealed the incident report and have not yet interviewed the nurse. ""We are investigating to see whether or not there was a crime that was committed,"" said Sgt. Frank Sousa of the Fort Lauderdale Police Department. In the meantime, a 24-hour patient hotline has been established. The hospital asks concerned patients to call 800-545-5716, or go to their Web site at www.browardhealth.org/patientnotice/#.","Over 1,800 patients received notification that could've been exposed to diseases .

"(CNN) -- Ex-Germany international Jens Lehmann is set to make a sensational return to English club Arsenal ten months after announcing his retirement from soccer. Manager Arsene Wenger confirmed the 41-year-old has re-signed for the title-chasing Gunners on a rolling monthly contract three years after leaving for Stuttgart. Lehmann, who made 199 appearances for Arsenal between 2003 and 2008, also represented Germany on 61 occasions before retiring in May 2010. He was part of Arsenal's 'Invincibles' side who went through the entire 2003-04 season unbeaten as they secured the English Premier League title. Wenger insisted it was a good move for the club, who have been knocked out of three competitions in the last three weeks, given injuries to Wojciech Szczesny, Vito Mannone and Lukasz Fabianski. He told reporters: ""Lehmann is training with us and will sign for the rest of the season. ""We have no cover in the Premier League, so that is why I decided to bring Jens back. I'm happy because when Jens is in training he is as motivated as ever. ""If he has to play, if I choose to play him, his huge motivational level will be vitally important."" Lehmann told the club's website: ""I'm very excited to be rejoining Arsenal. I have kept myself fit since the end of last season and I'm ready to contribute at any time for the team. ""I have many great memories from my previous time at the club and Arsenal has always had a place in my heart. It's special to be coming back."" Lehmann enjoyed a notoriously fractious relationship with Arsenal's current number one goalkeeper, Spaniard Manuel Almunia, with several of their disagreements spilling over into the public arena. Lehmann lost his place to Almunia in 2007 with the German calling it ""humiliating."" He told German television: ""To be sitting on the bench behind somebody who only started to play when he was 30 is not funny. I am very angry."" Almunia responded by telling British newspaper The Guardian: ""To have someone here who hates me is just amazing."" But despite the history of acrimony between the pair, Wenger insisted Lehmann's arrival would not be a problem as Arsenal try to overhaul Manchester United's three point lead at the top of the Premier League. He added: ""There has been much more said about that relationship than what happened. There is a lot of respect between the two goalkeepers. ""I think Jens Lehmann will get the best out of Almunia, because he will show him every day he is ready to fight for his place -- as he has always been. Almunia will be motivated by that.""","Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger confirms Jens Lehmann set to re-sign for the club .

"Ibadan, Nigeria (CNN) -- Separate bomb blasts ripped through a polling station and a collation center in northeastern Nigeria Saturday as Africa's most populous nation began voting in elections marred by violence and delays. The first explosion occurred at a voting station in the city of Maiduguri, National Emergency Management Agency spokesman Yushau Shuaib said. No deaths were reported; the number of injuries was still unknown. The second blast was also reported in Maiduguri, at the Abba Ganaram collation center, Shuaib said, adding that the explosion caused ""serious casualties."" It was not immediately clear how many people died. Also in Maiduguri, armed youths set a government building afire, Shuaib said. A new election chief promised ""free and fair"" elections this year, but the election has already been plagued by related bombings, assassinations and logistical problems that delayed the vote. Concerns are that continued violence could derail the vote altogether. Nigerians began voting Saturday for 360 House of Representatives seats and 109 Senate seats. The staggered voting structure will take them back to the polls next Saturday to vote for a president and on April 26 for a gubernatorial vote. Despite domestic and international pressure, Nigeria's Electoral Commission was forced to put off elections by a week after a nationwide logistical disaster -- many voting materials were not even in the country until voting day and party logos were missing from ballot papers. It was a huge setback, reminiscent of the problems of Nigeria's 2007 elections, described by the European Union as the worst it had seen anywhere in the world with rampant vote rigging, violence, theft of ballot boxes and intimidation. The legitimacy of the country now rides on the three rounds of polling. On the eve of the vote, a bomb exploded at the Independent National Electoral Commission office in Suleja in central Nigeria, officials said. A government official, who was not authorized to speak on the record, told CNN that eight people died in the attack. Shuaib said more than seven people were seriously injured. ""We condemn this cowardly and dastardly action, which seems designed to instill fear in Nigerians and paralyze their aspirations for peaceful and credible elections,"" the chairman of the electoral commission, Attahiru Jega, said in a statement. ""Our deep sympathies go to the families of all these young Nigerians who lost their lives or were injured."" Human Rights Watch estimates that at least 85 people have been killed in political violence so far. As Africa's most populous country and its largest oil producer, Nigeria is important. Yet, despite its enormous oil wealth, 80% of the population lives on less than $2 a day, according to the United Nations. ""Make no mistake about it: This test of honour is inescapably a collective one for all Nigerians,"" the Independent National Electoral Commission said in a recent statement. ""It is our national honour at stake, and our relevance in the affairs of the modern world being redefined."" Separately on Friday, one man was killed and another seriously injured in a blast in the northern city of Kaduna, state news reported. Police rushed to the scene and found unexploded dynamite there, according to the Kaduna State Police Commissioner Haruna John, Voice of Nigeria reported. They found more dynamite at a house belonging to he injured man, the outlet said.","NEW: Separate blasts rock a voting and collation center .

"(CNN) -- India batsman Sachin Tendulkar became the first player in history to score 2,000 runs at the Cricket World Cup, as the hosts eased to a five-wicket win over the Netherlands on Wednesday. Chasing a target of 189 runs to win, India booked their place in the quarterfinals of the tournament with 13 overs to spare in Delhi. Tendulkar, 37, was playing in his 40th World Cup match and reached a score of 27 before he was caught by Bradley Kruger off the bowling of Pieter Seelaar. Nicknamed ""the little master"", Tendulkar made his World Cup debut in 1992 and has hit five centuries and 13 fifties in cricket's premier 50-over competition. Dutch skipper Peter Borren was top scorer for the minnows as he registered a score of 38 off 36 deliveries. Zaheer Khan was the pick of the Indian bowlers with three wickets for just 20 runs as Netherlands were dismissed inside 47 overs. India made an awkward start to their response after three wickets from Seelar left the hosts in a worrying position on 82 for three. But left-handed batsman Yuvraj Singh steadied the ship for India with a half-century off 73 balls. The victory leaves India top of Group A with seven points and assured of their place in the next phase of the competition.","India beat Netherlands by five wickets to book their place in the quarterfinals .

"(CNN) -- Protesters staged fresh demonstrations in Saudi Arabia on Friday, calling on the government to release Shiite prisoners and grant more rights, human rights activists said. The protests, which were peaceful, also called for the withdrawal of regional forces from neighboring Bahrain, according to the activists, who requested their names not be used because they had concerns for their safety. All the protesters were Shiite. The protests took place in the city of Qatif and the village of Awamiyya, both in the country's Eastern Province, and each the scene of similar protests in March. In Qatif, about 200 people marched through the streets, chanting for the release of the prisoners, the activists said. Some carried Bahraini flags in a 90-minute march that some said was in solidarity with Bahrainis. In Awamiyya, more than 150 Shiite men and women marched for the release of prisoners and for the withdrawal of Gulf Cooperation Council forces from Bahrain. As in Qatif, some protesters carried Bahraini flags. Several members of the council have sent troops to Bahrain to help Manama quell anti-government protests. The protesters in Awamiyya also called for human rights in a march that lasted just over an hour. In both places, security forces were present but didn't interfere, the activists said. CNN was unable to reach the Saudi Interior Ministry for comment. The issue of Shiite prisoners and a demand for more rights have been the focus of similar protests in Saudi Arabia in the past two months, although fewer demonstrations have taken place in recent weeks. Others have demonstrated for the creation of a constitutional monarchy and other reforms.","Demonstrators call for human rights and the release of Shiite prisoners .

"(CNN) -- Some New York police officers still cannot communicate with each other with police radios, even though the issue plagued the rescue effort after the 9/11 attacks nearly 10 years ago, a New York state senator says. And that state senator says he plans to send a letter Thursday to President Barack Obama urging him to remedy the situation. NYPD helicopter video shows 9/11 attacks . ""Despite nearly a decade passing since the September 11, 2001 attacks ... our first responders, the brave men and women who will be standing on the front lines of our next attack and running into buildings as most are running out, still, in far too many instances, do not have proper interoperability they need, and in some cases still cannot communicate at all,"" the letter written by state Sen. Greg Ball says. Ball, who is also the chairman of the New York State Homeland Security Committee, said the issue was highlighted last week during a homeland security hearing. At the hearing Robert Morris, a police union official, talked about the problems. ""The officer carries a radio on his belt but he might as well be wearing a brick,"" Morris said. The radios are so bad in some cases that officers have used their cell phones to communicate with each other, Ball said. Officers with the Metropolitan Transit Authority have also been severely plagued with the faulty radios. In 2008, a New York labor safety board urged the transit police department to fix the issue with the radios but the issue still has not been resolved, Ball said. Ball said he also plans to send his letter to all members of Congress.","Radios so faulty some officers use cell phones to communicate, state senator says .

"(CNN) -- ""Dear Chinese Government,"" began a message sent late Thursday from Twitter CEO Dick Costolo. ""Year-long detentions for sending a sarcastic tweet are neither the way forward nor the future of your great people,"" he wrote on his Twitter profile. Costolo's edict is no doubt a response to the Chinese woman who had been sentenced to a year in a labor camp for retweeting a message that officials in China disapproved of. The tweet mocked Chinese people who were aligning with the Chinese government by protesting Japanese products. In an hour, Costolo's message had well surpassed a hundred retweets -- an act similar to forwarding an e-mail, denoting interest in the content. It quickly climbed to the top spot on the list of trending tweets, an automated system that surfaces popular messages on the service. A Chinese government official could not be reached late Thursday for comment on the tweet. The arrested woman, Cheng Jianping, on October 17 retweeted a message from her fiance, which read, ""Anti-Japanese demonstration, smashing Japanese products, this kind of stuff has been done by some people like Guo Quan many years ago. That's nothing new. Actually the most efficient way should be flying to Shanghai right away and smashing Japanese Pavilion at Expo."" She added ""Go! Angry young people!"" to her retweet, according to a translation by CNN. Chinese leaders have not been keen on information-sharing services like Twitter in the past. China has censored or blocked access to the website during major events, along with other blogs and social networks. Last year it put a wall in front of the site for Chinese Web surfers during the anniversary of the Tiananmen Square protest. Google has had a back-and-forth business relationship with China. It initially agreed to censor search results in that country but later backtracked. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg used his own website as a platform for talking about China recently, though his message was decidedly less controversial. ""What are the best Mandarin-speaking cities to visit in China?"" Zuckerberg posed to users of a beta feature called Questions. Zuckerberg is believed to be planning a trip to China, Forbes reports. The Asian country will be important to Facebook's business, he said at an event last month.","Twitter CEO Dick Costolo sent a message on his Twitter page late Thursday night .

"(CNN) -- Shock and sadness etched the faces of residents in northeastern Wisconsin as daylight on Monday revealed the damage left behind by a powerful storm that cut a swath through the state. An emergency declaration has been made for the city of Kaukauna, where early estimates were that 157 homes had been either damaged or destroyed Sunday night, the city's police chief said. City officials, including the police, fire, planning and utility departments, went out in four teams for the morning assessment. ""This tornado, what we believe is a tornado, moved through, hit the back of houses, jumped over the front of those, then hit the front of the houses homes and hit the front of the houses on the other side of the street,"" said Kaukauna Police Chief John Manion. Despite the damage estimates, which officials believe will grow, no injuries were reported in Kaukauna from the storm. ""People were well warned,"" Manion said. ""That contributes to life."" Kaukauna is about 20 miles southwest of Green Bay. Authorities in Lincoln County, in northern Wisconsin, did a door-to-door search after the Sunday night storm. At least 25 homes suffered severe damage, said Mark Handlin of the Lincoln County Sheriff's Office. The worst damage was north of Merrill, about 170 miles north-northwest of Milwaukee, he said. Crews are working to clear downed trees and power lines, Handlin said. A shelter has been set up at a motel. Two residents were airlifted to a larger regional hospital because of the extent of their injuries, said Brian Sladek, director of Lincoln County emergency management.

"Dallas (CNN) -- Once fearing one of the worst days in the state's history for battling wildfires, Texas firefighters got the upper hand Sunday on several blazes though others remained out of their control. The six new wildfires reported Sunday, all in different counties, were relatively small and quickly brought under control, the Texas Forest Service said in a statement. ""(Firefighters were) pretty lucky today,"" said Alan Craft, a spokesman for the state's Lone Star Incident Management Team. The most damage -- to an unoccupied mobile home, horse trailer and another building -- occurred over an acre in Newton County, but that fire was controlled. Eleven structures were threatened and one camper was lost over 129 acres in Angelina County, the state agency added. Still, despite successes in squelching these blazes, authorities were fighting to manage 19 other, appreciably bigger blazes. This challenge, as well as the weather outlook, had prompted the Forest Service to state that ""conditions on Sunday could shape up to be among the worst in Texas history."" Gov. Rick Perry renewed a disaster proclamation in effect for all of Texas' 249 counties -- even though major fires are occurring in 13 of them -- to expedite assistance in case of new fires, his office said Sunday in a statement. In addition to more than 750 personnel working with the Texas Forest Service, the governor's statement noted that two Blackhawk helicopters with the Texas Military Forces, bulldozers from the state transportation department and resources from 60 fire departments statewide were part of the effort. Authorities in the Lone Star state have responded to 6,831 fires over 643,000 acres since wildfire season began. The biggest fire still not under control was continuing Sunday in 71,000 acres in parts of Stonewall, Knox and King counties. Air resources, bulldozers, fire engines and other tools and personnel were being used in that fight, the Forest Service said. Another of the hardest slogs may be in Presidio County, where none of the 60,000 imperiled acres was considered to be contained Sunday. The Forest Service has deployed three air tankers, 60 firefighters, bulldozers and other equipment and personnel, in addition to a host of other state and local resources, focused on this blaze. Already, 30 to 40 homes in Fort Davis have been lost due to this fire, according to the Forest Service. Another 34 homes have burned in Midland County, due to a fire over 16,500 acres that the state agency on Sunday described as ""very active"" and not at all contained. A Red Cross shelter has been set up at Midland College for those displaced or otherwise affected by this wildfire. ""(Firefighters) can't outrun it,"" said Craft. There have been no evacuations yet related to another 60,000-acre blaze, this one in Potter and Moore counties near the city of Masterson. That fire is 50% contained and is still considered a threat to the towns of Dumas and Sunray. Texas is not alone, as wildfires are burning in large swaths of the Southwest and Midwest, fanned in part by dry, warm and windy conditions. The National Weather Service has issued ""red flag warnings"" through Sunday evening -- indicative of what it calls ""critical fire weather conditions"" -- in New Mexico, Colorado, Kansas, Missouri, Oklahoma and Texas. But by Sunday night, such warnings were only in effect for parts of Texas and New Mexico. Oklahoma Gov. Mary Fallin on Sunday extended a state of emergency for seven counties. The designation authorizes state agencies to make emergency purchases needed to quickly deliver resources to local jurisdictions, the state's emergency operations center said. The National Weather Service has posted fire warnings for the western two-thirds of the state. On Saturday, a grass fire burning just south of Cleveland, Oklahoma, prompted evacuations. As many as 70 firefighters were involved in the response, as well as three helicopters, said Terry Dennis, a spokesman with the Cleveland Fire Department. Twelve families checked into a Red Cross shelter, but more were evacuated, he said. Dennis said Saturday there had been no reports of injuries. In Texas, the fear is that relentless heavy winds and dry weather could spawn a rash of wildfires similar to those that swept across the southern plains states on April 9, 2009. Those fires scorched 147,924 acres, destroyed 111 homes and killed four people, the Texas Forest Service stated on its website. CNN's Stephanie Gallman, Mariano Castillo and Kara Devlin contributed to this report.","NEW: Firefighters were ""pretty lucky today,"" a state spokesman says .

"Hinkley, California (CNN) -- Pacific Gas and Electric, the utility company at the center of a long standing water contamination problem in this small agricultural town, is trying to soothe growing unease by offering to buy homes located near a chemical plume . In a letter to residents, which was also provided to CNN, the utility also said it will establish a community advisory group to ""more consistently hear concerns and feedback from the community."" The town of Hinkley became famous from the Oscar winning film ""Erin Brockovich"" starring Julia Roberts. The movie, released in 2000, chronicles how Brockovich, a paralegal, helped win a $333 million settlement from PG&E. Brockovich has been talking with residents about their renewed concerns. ""I'm thinking somebody somewhere has been asleep at the wheel,"" she told CNN. The problem arose after a chemical known as chromium 6 seeped into the groundwater. Chromium 6 was used between 1952 and 1966 to prevent rust in machinery at a nearby PG&E plant. The chemical has been proven to cause a number of life threatening illnesses, including cancer. According to Lahontan Regional Water Quality Control Board, the chemicals have continued to spread and traces of chromium 6 have been recently detected in a previously untainted aquifer. ""The remediation itself has been very effective, but an underground aquifer is something that is just difficult to centralize and keep in one area,"" said Greg Pruett, a senior vice president for PG&E. The utility maintains that the drinking water meets safety standards set by California, but acknowledges that it needs to give residents a sense of confidence that it takes their concerns seriously. To that end, PG&E is giving some residents free bottles of water. In addition, residents who live over or next to the chemical plume will be able to participate in PG&E's home purchase program. Pruett hopes residents view it as a good faith offer. ""Our attitude is lets work with you. Lets purchase your property -- and let's help you relocate,"" he said .","Utility says it will establish a community advisory group .

"Sanaa, Yemen (CNN) -- A Yemeni man injured in protests at Sanaa University died of his wounds early Wednesday morning, a medical official said. Mohamed Ali Mutlak, 24, was among dozens of anti-government demonstrators wounded Tuesday when security forces fired into the air and shot tear gas into a crowd of tens of thousands of protesters who had massed in front of Sanaa University, witnesses said. Eight of them were still in critical condition, said Dr. Waseem Qurashi, head of the medical department at Change Square, Sanaa University. According to witness Ala'a Al-Khowlani, at least 40 anti-government demonstrators were wounded and at least one of them was in critical condition. Other witnesses put the number of wounded as high as 67. Protests took place across the country Wednesday, witnesses said, but there was no word of violence. Tens of thousands of anti-government demonstrators were outside Sanaa University. In Taiz, tens of thousands of protesters continued their sit-in protest, calling for Saleh's ouster. Thousands were also in the streets of Ibb, Aden, Hodeidah, and Dhamar. However, the recent casualties drew condemnation. Amnesty International on Wednesday urged Yemeni authorities to ""end deadly night raids and other attacks on protests."" ""This is the second time in three weeks that protesters have been killed in late night raids by the security forces in the capital,"" said Philip Luther, Amnesty International's deputy director for the Middle East and North Africa. ""These disturbing heavy-handed tactics used with lethal effect against protesters must stop immediately. People must be allowed to assemble and protest in peace."" Amnesty said about 30 people have reportedly been killed in Yemen in the ""ongoing unrest which began early last month."" Mohammed Abulahoum, a senior government official, Wednesday condemned ""the acts of violence used by the police and the military last night against civilian protesters outside the university. ""There was no need for that force. This will only escalate the tension between both sides,"" he added. He also rejected the official government explanation that tribesmen had tried to sneak arms into a no-weapons zone. ""They had no arms with them and they had no intention of using arms,"" Abulahoum charged,  saying he knows those tribesmen. Yaser Al-Hasani, one of the demonstrators, said security forces cracked down after students defied their orders not to take food and blankets into the protest area outside the gates of the university. The supplies were intended for the thousands of anti-government demonstrators who have camped out calling for Saleh to step down. In a statement e-mailed to reporters, the government blamed the violence on people who had tried to sneak weapons into a ""weapon-free area"" outside the university, then resisted arrest. ""The suspects resisted arrest and soon thereafter a gun fight broke out, injuring dozens of suspected militants, policemen and innocent bystanders,"" a government statement said. ""Panic from the shootings set off a raging stampede in the area. There is no official confirmation on casualties at this point."" The government said early Wednesday that the situation was under control and that the Interior Ministry would investigate the incident. Yemen's anti-government demonstrations are unfolding in a nation wracked by a Shiite Muslim uprising, a U.S.-aided crackdown on al Qaeda operatives and a looming shortage of water. High unemployment fuels much of the anger among a growing and impoverished young population. The protesters also cite government corruption and a lack of political freedom. Saleh, who has refused to step down, has said he will not run again for the presidency in the next election. CNN's Christine Theodorou, Mohammed Jamjoom and journalist Hakim Almasmari contributed to this report .","NEW:  Protests took place at locations across Yemen Wednesday .

"(CNN) -- Why do food and murder go so well together? Perhaps because it presents a delicious paradox, a combination of comforting and disturbing elements that tease the imagination and palate simultaneously. ""Murder is the deprivation of life,"" culinary mystery author Diane Mott Davidson said. ""Talking about food is life-affirming. When I read the Spenser novels by Robert B. Parker, I noticed that when Spenser was thinking about a case, he would often prepare a meal. Cooking provided a way for him to reflect on the case."" Davidson can relate to cooking as therapy that fuels for the writing process. When planning out the plots for her Goldy Schulz catering mysteries, Davidson finds relaxation in her kitchen, simultaneously coming up with recipes to include in the books. ""Food is a very powerful mnemonic,"" culinary mystery author Katherine Hall Page said. ""We remember what we eat from childhood, and we have a very positive association with food. Then you pair it with crime, and it provides a twist. You have the comfort of food, then, what's going on here? It gives an element of surprise, of suspense. Poison only further complicates, of course."" For Denise Swanson, author of the Scumble River mysteries, food is the comfort-aspect in her books. Readers eager to try ""cozy mysteries,"" rather than thriller or suspense novels, psychologically take comfort in the inclusion of food. ""While we're writing about murder, we're really writing about everyday life,"" Swanson said. ""Murder is something extraordinary that happens in the everyday lives of our characters. Our sleuths are in the midst of what they always do."" Half-Italian and half-Swedish, Swanson took inspiration from where she grew up. ""Food plays such a big part in small-town life,"" Swanson said. ""Where else but the Midwest are you served a Jell-O salad with crushed pretzels and strawberries? I keep a tradition of trying to include family recipes that match the flavor of the book."" Food is already a basis for relationships in society, a way of connecting to one another or identifying personality traits based on what we eat, Swanson said. Toss in a whodunit murder, and people can't help but be intrigued. Regional dishes and flavors also add a twist by either reconnecting readers with their childhood favorites or introducing them to new food cultures. Culinary mysteries combine all the right ingredients for a sumptuous puzzle: quirky amateur sleuths, elements of danger and a fabulous array of food set in locations with a cast of colorful characters. These authors of ""traditional"" and ""cozy"" mysteries know that including food also works to reassure readers. Justice will win out in the end, Page said. ""I'm not going to leave you with a bleak view of the universe, and there's good food along the way."" Authors are inspired to write culinary mysteries because they already enjoy cooking. ""The elements of writing crime are like a recipe,"" Page said. ""You have all the ingredients, or clues, and then follow step-by-step how to put them together. You stick it in the oven, which is the mystery, and then out comes a cake, or your resolution."" Whether on vacation or needing to unwind from a hectic workday, many women know they can pick up a culinary mystery and lose themselves in the comfort or even sensuality of when food and murder come together. They witness glimpses of their own lives while partaking of the extraordinary. ""The overwhelming majority of mystery readers are women,"" said Natalee Rosenstein, a senior executive editor of the Penguin publishing group. ""They see their own lives reflected in these characters. They're baking cookies for their kids or church benefits and reading about people that do the same thing, so they get that sense of identification."" Readers may be comforted by the food while reading about unacceptable violence. ""It's an interesting combination, death, food and murder,"" Dr. Susan Kavaler-Adler, a clinical psychologist and psychoanalyst specializing in mourning, said.  ""Loss is not that simple, it involves a lot of issues about aggression. Comfort food can momentarily take away feelings that are frightening or have aggression in them."" ""When it is on a visceral level, that's when something like a rich food can alleviate the toxicity of that feeling, but it's only a temporary fix. It sounds like these (culinary mysteries) are using food to counteract something about the fears of rage that are expressed as actual murder."" Many writers who mix their murders with a good meal cite the well-fed character in the Nero Wolfe mystery books that later became TV series.  A Wolfe fan, Page published her first culinary mystery in 1989. The food in this genre of mystery sets each series apart: Cheese, bakeshop, pizza, tea and White House chef mysteries. ""I think what's new are the types that tickle people's imaginations,"" Rosenstein said. ""People are reading for entertainment, and while they do, they have a nice plate of cookies and an iced tea by their side."" What comes first, the perfect crime or the perfect recipe? Like Davidson, Page and Swanson, Livia Washburn, author of the Fresh Baked series, develops her recipes while she's working on each book, constantly tweaking until the last minute so they turn out just so, she said. Like her sleuth working through a puzzle, recipe tweaking is trial and error. ""Trying to solve a murder is much like trying to come up with a good recipe,"" Washburn said. ""You have to try a little of this, a little of that, and see how it all comes together."" The inclusion of recipes in the backs of books also became a popular aspect for readers. In the beginning, Page didn't include them, but when readers began requesting recipes by mail, Page knew it was time to share them with everyone. But for the amount of time these novels have been popular, why the sudden boom? ""Culinary mysteries are here to stay,"" Rosenstein said. ""It's taken a long time for women mystery writers and cozy mystery writers to get the respect of the mystery genre community. They kind of forced their way in the door, so it became hard to ignore."" Page, also author of ""Have Faith in Your Kitchen,"" a collection of recipes based on those in her Faith Fairchild series, uses a quote from a Frenchman in the late 1800s at the beginning of her cookbook to describe the relationship between murder and food. ""'Bad taste leads to crime,'"" Page quoted. ""It's a wonderful encapsulation of how the two go together.""","Culinary murder mysteries have been popular since the days of Nero Wolfe novels .

"Seoul, South Korea (CNN) -- It was code-named ""Dawn of Gulf of Aden,"" and when South Korea gave it a green light Friday, its daring execution led to five hours of chilling drama on the high seas. A South Korean navy destroyer and Lynx helicopters fired warning shots as elite forces, in pre-dawn darkness, silently approached the deck of the freighter Samho Jewelry, hijacked by Somali pirates Saturday, according to the Yonhap news agency. The pirates fired with their AK-47s and rocket-propelled grenades. The South Koreans shot back. When it was all over, the South Koreans had rescued 21 sailors, killed eight pirates and captured five others, said Lt. Gen. Lee Sung-ho, a spokesman for South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff. The captain of the 11,500-ton ship was shot in the stomach during the rescue, but no other crew member was hurt. South Korean President Lee Myung-bak praised the bold rescue in a nationally televised address. ""Our military carried out the operation perfectly under difficult circumstances,"" he said. ""We will not accept any actions that threaten the lives of our people."" Lee said the U.S. military also assisted in the operation. A U.S. Navy helicopter from the USS Shoup performed a medical evacuation in the operation. ""This mission shows that the South Korean government will not negotiate with pirates,""  Lee said. The South Koreans launched their secret rescue mission earlier in the week, chasing the Samho Jewelry for days in the Arabian Sea. When the pirates seemed exhausted and after intelligence that suggested a pirate ""mother ship"" was leaving a Somali port, the South Koreans decided to attempt the rescue, Yonhap said. The Samho Jewelry was carrying chemicals from the United Arab Emirates to Sri Lanka when it was hijacked. Somali pirates have seized seven other South Korean ships. All but one have been released with ransom payments, Yonhap said. CNN's Paula Hancocks and Charley Keyes contributed to this report.","The South Korean navy rescued 21 sailors, killed eight pirates and captured five .

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- At least three people were killed in one of three attacks in Afghanistan Thursday morning, officials said. The deadly attack occurred in Paktia province near a police station, said Azad Gull, a district governor. Four suicide bombers attacked the police station and one was able to get inside and detonate his explosives, Gull said. Three police officers were killed in the attack and two were injured, Gull said. A Taliban spokesman said his organization was responsible of the attack. ""(We) have killed many local policemen during the attack on a local police center,"" said Zabiullah Mojahed, the spokesman. Police were able to shoot and kill one of the attackers before he could detonate his bomb and the other two attackers were unaccounted for, Gull said.

"(CNN) -- Spanish motorcycling star Dani Pedrosa has had successful surgery to remove a titanium plate from his shoulder, it was announced on Wednesday. The Honda rider, second in last year's MotoGP world championship, had the plate inserted last October after suffering a double fracture to his collarbone in the Japanese Grand Prix. The 25-year-old experienced numbness during Sunday's Spanish Grand Prix, so chose to have the operation during a break in the 2011 calendar. The next race in the elite division's season is not until May 1 in Portugal because this year's race in Japan was canceled due to the devastation caused by last month's earthquake and tsunami. ""Dani Pedrosa has undergone successful surgery at Teknon Medical Center, in Barcelona, to decompress his left subclavian artery and is expected to recover satisfactorily,"" the official MotoGP website reported. ""In order to release the arterial compression, the titanium plate and the screws fixed to the collarbone have been removed. ""Pedrosa will remain in hospital for a further 48 hours to continue treatment with analgesia and anti-inflammatories."" The Sabadell native will be assessed by doctors next week to decide if he will be fit for the next round of competition in Estoril. Pedrosa, who moved up to MotoGP class in 2006, is currently second in the standings after two races thanks to his second-place finish last weekend in Jerez. He is nine points behind his compatriot Jorge Lorenzo of Yamaha, the reigning champion, who won his home race for the second year in a row. A two-time 250cc class world champion and once titleholder in the 125cc class, Pedrosa has won 12 races at the highest level but is yet to claim his maiden title.","Honda Repsol rider Dani Pedrosa has successful surgery to remove metal plate .

"New York (CNN) -- Gus Coletti was shaving when he heard a bang on the door of his house on a barrier island in New York. ""Help me! Help me!"" a woman pleaded when he opened the door, shaving cream still on his face. Coletti says he dialed 911 as the woman bolted, tripping halfway down his steep wooden staircase before unsuccessfully seeking help at a neighbor's home. Now, a year later, Coletti is convinced that the woman he saw that morning was Shannan Gilbert, a prostitute whose disappearance triggered an investigation that led police to discover at least eight bodies on a remote stretch of beach in Long Island. In an interview months ago, however, he said he couldn't be sure it was Gilbert at his door that day. Police say they suspect a serial killer or killers. Authorities in New York's Suffolk and Nassau Counties and in New Jersey, along with the FBI, are still searching for Gilbert, a resident of Jersey City, New Jersey. If Coletti did see Gilbert, he may have been the last person known to have seen her before she vanished. Yet he says it took Suffolk County police four months to question him, an assertion the police deny. ""A missing person detective came in August, was asking about her. I said, 'Where have you been?' "" Coletti said. Investigators in Suffolk County say Coletti gave them a written statement a month after he called 911 to report seeing the woman at his door, but Coletti disputes that. ""They never got a statement from me in June,"" he says. Coletti has insisted that he gave police a written statement in December, eight months after he says the woman knocked on his door. The Suffolk County police also say they have spoken to Coletti several times since last May 1, though they did not specify when those discussions happened. His account is chilling. It was about 5 a.m. when Coletti, 75, says he heard a knock on the door of his home on the barrier island hamlet of Oak Beach, New York. After the woman dashed away from his house, Coletti says, she hid under his boat, elevated and parked on his lawn, as an SUV drove up. Coletti says he walked up to the vehicle and questioned the driver, whom he described a slim Asian man weighing about 150 pounds. ""I went down, and I stopped him, and I said, 'Where do you think you're going?' "" recalled Coletti. The man said he was searching for the woman because she had left a party upset, and he was trying to find her to bring her back to the house, according to Coletti. ""I says, 'I already called the police. Stay right here.' He says, 'Oh, you shouldn't have done that. She's going to be into a lot of trouble.' I says, 'So are you,' "" Coletti recalled. Gilbert dashed from the boat and ran around the corner toward the beach, Coletti said. The driver then pursued her. Police arrived about 45 minutes later, and Coletti directed them to the road to the beach. Coletti says a detective showed up in August to ask him about what happened that day. In response to Coletti's ""Where have you been?"" question, the detective told him he had just received the missing person report from New Jersey. ""New Jersey dropped the ball. He blamed it on New Jersey,"" Coletti said. Jersey City Police Department spokesman Lt. Edgar Martinez said, ""We have no comment on any ongoing investigation in our jurisdiction. We are investigating a missing person.""","Gus Coletti is convinced that Shannan Gilbert came to his door .

"Ciudad Juarez, Mexico (CNN) -- A former police chief known for battling drug gangs in the Mexican border city of Tijuana has been named the new top cop in Ciudad Juarez, another city plagued by cartel violence. Former Baja California state police chief Julian Leyzaola ""is our new boss,"" Juarez police spokesman Adrian Sanchez said Thursday. Sanchez said Leyzaola was credited with cleaning up Tijuana during his tenure there, and ""We hope he can do the same here in Juarez."" Battles among rival drug gangs were blamed for more than 3,000 killings in Juarez in 2010. Leyzaola launched a public battle with one of Mexico's most wanted drug traffickers, Teodoro ""El Teo"" Garcia Simental, after he took office in Tijuana in 2008. Garcia's cartel threatened to kill five police officers a week until Leyzaola resigned -- but by January 2010, Garcia was behind bars. Leyzaola survived a series of assassination attempts and moved his family out of Mexico for a period of time, sleeping on an army base during that period. CNN's Nick Valencia contributed to this report.","Julian Leyzaola is credited with taking down a major drug boss in Tijuana .

"(CNN) -- Former Formula One world champion Jenson Button has told CNN that he believes the sport's decision to switch to Pirelli tires for 2011 will suit his style of racing. The Italian manufacturer are producing tires that are more bio-degradable than previous years, meaning drivers need to place a greater emphasis on the way they handle their cars -- something that Button feels plays to his strengths. With the new Formula One season about to start in Melbourne, Button told CNN Sport's Don Riddell:  ""I am good to my tires, it is something I have worked on for many years. Will new tires decide the Formula One title? ""For me it is important to be precise with everything I do, the steering, the throttle, the breaks,"" added the Briton. ""And with these new tires there will be more stability, which is something I really look for in a car, so hopefully it will really help me."" Button is taller than McLaren teammate Lewis Hamilton and the cockpit of the MP4-26 has been moulded to his specifications, in sharp contrast to last season when the 2010 McLaren was built around Hamilton's specifications. Button said: ""Last year was a little bit tricky for me to get into the car. It was built for Lewis, who is shorter than me. ""This new car is fitted around me so I feel a lot more at home. I have got my own steering wheel with buttons fitted exactly where I want them, which is a nice feeling. ""If you don't feel at home in a car, you don't feel part of it -- and you need to feel part of it to drive it well."" Button has already won one world title but believes he has the ability to add to that 2009 success and has not lost the desire to become champion again. ""Racing in Formula One, and trying to win, is the most important thing in my life at the moment and to win the world title again would be a great feeling,"" said Button. ""But I really don't know if that would be enough for me. You always want more and, at this moment in time, one more world title would be enough for me. ""But if I do win the world title this year, I think it would be very difficult for me to walk away from the sport.""","Jenson Button tells CNN that he is happy with the switch to Pirelli tires for 2011 .

"(CNN) -- Forget the immensely powerful car or the wealth of up-to-the-minute gadgets at his disposal, if Felipe Massa drives to Formula One glory this season it'll be thanks to his lucky pants. The Brazilian, who drives for the Ferrari team, came agonizingly close to taking his first ever world title in 2008 but was pipped to the post by Briton Lewis Hamilton on the final lap of the final race of the season. The following year he was lucky to survive after being hit on the head by a stray suspension spring that had flown from a rival's car during qualifying for the Hungarian Grand Prix. But in 2011 he is hoping for no more obstacles as he guns for the world crown, with the help of his underwear. ""I have special underwear which I race in most of the time,"" he told CNN. ""[I wear them] just for the Saturday and Sunday I don't wash but, two days, what's the problem?"" Massa replied. His superstitions don't end there. He always lands on his right foot when he gets out of bed in the morning and makes sure the same foot enters his car first before a race. ""I think the superstition is just something that is inside your brain,"" he explained. ""For sure, you would win because you have the underwear or because you are happy or whatever. ""You win because you are doing the best job, but inside your brain it is important to have everything clean and everything ready and that's why sporting people are superstitious."" With some impressive pre-season testing sessions under his belt many pundits are tipping Massa to muscle his way into the title reckoning in 2011, so could this finally be his year? ""Yes, I believe in my speed, I believe in the way I drive and I believe I can win many races and the championship. I think that's very important to have inside your brain, to be stronger and stronger all the time. ""And I know if I have all the possibilities and everything that is automatically for my driving style, for the way I drive I can be there."" After persistent problems with his car last season Massa thinks the new Pirelli tires to be used in the forthcoming campaign will benefit his racing style. ""Most of the problems I had last year should be alright for this year because the tires are much softer, to get the temperature in the tires it will be easier, so I expect not to have this problem, but we are a little bit early to say that. ""I like the tires, for sure. They're very different from last year, so maybe we are going to have more pit-stops because otherwise after some laps you are struggling a lot on the tires. So it's a big change for the championship, it's a big strategy change, but I enjoy it,"" he said. Massa also rejects the oft-repeated notion that if he is to clinch a world title he will have to leave Ferrari in order to do so. ""I don't think so,"" he said. ""I think I'm in a top team, it's important to have a top car and if I have that I will fight to the maximum level to be the champion. ""Ferrari is just the top in motorsport, it is a dream car on the road, for sure it is the most important thing. When you drive for a team like Ferrari it really is a dream come true."" Massa showed courage to climb back into a Formula One car just ten weeks after his life-threatening crash in Hungary but he insists he never dwells on what might have been. ""I never dream about the accident,"" he said. ""What is important to say is that it was not my time. I believe in God, I am Catholic, so I'm sure it was not my time, it was a not the moment to go to a different life. ""There's nothing to say about that. When it's not your time, you know, you stay here.""","Formula One driver Felipe Massa speaks to CNN about his superstitions .

"(Wired) -- No more will soldiers' vision be limited to the socket-embedded spheres that God intended. The Pentagon now wants troops to see dangers lurking behind them in real time, and be able to tell if an object a kilometer away is a walking stick or an AK-47. In a solicitation released today, Darpa, the Pentagon's far-out research branch, unveiled the Soldier Centric Imaging via Computational Cameras effort, or SCENICC. Imagine a suite of cameras that digitally capture a kilometer-wide, 360-degree sphere, representing the image in 3-D onto a wearable eyepiece. You'd be able to literally see all around you, including behind yourself, and zooming in at will, creating a ""stereoscopic/binocular system, simultaneously providing 10x zoom to both eyes."" And you would do this all hands-free, apparently by barking out or pre-programming a command (the solicitation leaves it up to a designer's imagination) to adjust focus. Then comes the Terminator-vision. Darpa wants the eyepiece to include ""high-resolution computer-enhanced imagery as well as task-specific non-image data products such as mission data overlays, threat warnings/alerts, targeting assistance, etc."" Target identified: Sarah Connor... The ""Full Sphere Awareness"" tool will provide soldiers with ""muzzle flash detection,"" ""projectile tracking"" and ""object recognition/labeling,"" basically pointing key information out to them. And an ""integrated weapon sighting"" function locks your gun on your target when acquired. That's far beyond an app mounted on your rifle that keeps track of where your friendlies and enemies are. The imaging wouldn't just be limited to what any individual soldier sees. SCENICC envisions a ""networked optical sensing capability"" that fuses images taken from nodes worn by ""collections of soldiers and/or unmanned vehicles."" The Warrior-Alpha drone overhead? Its full-motion video and still images would be sent into your eyepiece. It also has to be ridiculously lightweight, weighing less than 700 grams for the entire system -- including a battery powerful enough to ""exceed 24 hours [usage] under normal conditions."" That's about a pound and a half, maximum. The Army's experimental ensemble of wearable gadgets weighs about eight pounds. And it is to SCENICC what your Roomba is to the T-1000. Here's how far advanced SCENICC is compared to bleeding-edge imaging and networking capabilities that the Army is currently developing. Right now, the Army's asking three different companies -- Raytheon, Rockwell Collins and General Dynamics -- to build a wearable platform of digital maps, computers and radios, networked with one another. Soldiers would have warzone maps beamed onto helmet-mounted eyepieces. The system, known as Nett Warrior, needs to weigh less than eight pounds, and it builds on a years-long and ultimately fruitless effort called Land Warrior. (One of the problems with Land Warrior is it was heavy and cumbersome, owing in part to battery weight.) The Army hopes to choose one of the Nett Warrior designs by March. By the time it'll actually roll out Nett Warrior after testing, production and deployment -- a few years, optimistically -- SCENICC will already be hard at work on its replacement. Darpa wants a hands-free zooming function within two years of work on the contract. By year three, the computer-enhanced vision tool needs to be ready. Year four is for 360-degree vision. Then it's on to development. The Army is generally hot for combat-ready smartphones to keep soldiers linked up with each other. And the buzz-generating tool for the soldier of the near future is mapping technology, delivered onto a smartphone or some other handheld mobile device, at least judging from this year's Association of the U.S. Army confab. But all of these representation tools are two-dimensional, and require soldiers to look away from their patrols in order to use them. Textron's SoldierEyes Common Operating Picture, for instance, lets soldiers see icons on a tablet-mounted map telling them where their friends, enemies and neutrals are. It can't put those icons onto a 3-D picture sent to a soldier's eyes, let alone allow a 10x zoom for a kilo-wide 360-degree field of vision. Why would anyone use a map on a smartphone when they could have SCENICC? Even with all the advances in digital imaging, it'll be a tall order to put together 360-degree vision and 10x zoom and mapping software and integration with weapons systems and lightweight miniaturization and network connectivity. Darpa doesn't really address how the system's networked optics would work in low-bandwidth areas like, say, eastern Afghanistan (though maybe drone-borne cell towers can help). Indeed, judging from the solicitation, while SCENICC is supposed to be networked, it doesn't seem to have any communications requirements for soldiers to talk through what their optics are sharing with each other. Maybe there's a role for those new soldier smartphones after all. Subscribe to WIRED magazine for less than $1 an issue and get a FREE GIFT! Click here!

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Increased security was put in place at Dodger Stadium ahead of Thursday's baseball game between the Dodgers and the St. Louis Cardinals in the wake of a March 31 attack in which a San Francisco Giants fan was seriously injured. Bryan Stow, 42, was put in a medically induced coma following, which followed a Dodgers-Giants game. About 100 witnesses saw Stow attacked as he left a stadium parking lot. The two suspected assailants fled after the beating in a light-colored, four-door car driven by a woman with a young boy inside, authorities have said. Family members said doctors have lowered Stow's sedation and are hoping he wakes up soon. ""We have received hundreds of tips, but we are far from a solution,"" Los Angeles Police Chief Charlie Beck told reporters Thursday. He appealed to those with information to come forward, saying they can do so anonymously. He showed reporters new composite sketches of the suspects. Officials are offering a $100,000 reward for information leading to arrests and convictions. ""I haven't had that 'Aha!' moment yet,"" said Beck. ""We haven't got where I want to get."" Fans attending Thursday's game will notice an increased police presence inside and outside the stadium, Beck told reporters. Officers are tasked with ensuring the no-tailgating rule is enforced and no fans are drinking in surrounding areas before entering the stadium, he said. In addition, increased lighting has been added to the parking lots. At the game, ""if you're unruly, if you're threatening, if you're making comments that would lead to violence, you'll be ejected,"" Beck said. ""And if they rise to a criminal level, you'll be arrested."" In addition, a half-off alcohol promotion at the stadium has been discontinued, and officers will be in the crowd watching for people who appear to be intoxicated, officials said. Other issues being examined include lighting and camera systems, said former Los Angeles Police Chief William Bratton, whose risk consulting company Kroll is working with officials. Dodgers owner Frank McCourt said he hopes officials can go even further and bring about changes in fans' behavior. ""We sincerely hope that the solutions we put in place here at Dodger Stadium will be used at sports and entertainment venues throughout America,"" McCourt said. Stow is hospitalized at the Los Angeles County-University of Southern California Medical Center. As of Wednesday, ""There have been no more seizures for a couple days,"" Stow's sister Erin wrote on a website launched to provide updates on his condition, www.support4bryanstow.com. Doctors have been lowering his sedation, she wrote. ""Once it's out of his system, he can be examined and hopefully (praying) he responds to commands. Or better yet, wakes up."" Stow has had no seizures for five days, his cousin, John Stow, told CNN affiliate KRON on Thursday, ""which is tremendous. We're very thankful."" He said it's not known when Stow will wake up. ""Head injuries are unique,"" he said. ""Every case is different, so we're just going to be patient ... Bryan's going to do it when he's ready."" The family has said they are grateful for the outpouring of support. Since the unprovoked attack, money has poured in from numerous donors and fundraising events to help pay for Stow's medical costs and support his two young children. At a dual fundraiser Monday at Dodger Stadium and AT&T Park in San Francisco, where the two teams played, more than $120,000 was raised, said American Medical Response spokesman Jason Sorrick. In all, more than $200,000 has been raised for Stow, who works for AMR. ""We couldn't be more proud of Bryan and the way the community has rallied around him,"" John Stow said. Another event was to be held in the San Francisco area Thursday. At Dodger Stadium, collection bins will be available for those wishing to donate, officials said Thursday. CNN's Stan Wilson contributed to this report.","San Francisco Giants fan Bryan Stow was beaten March 31 .

"(CNN) -- The more I think about it the more I am convinced I need one of Eric Clapton's old guitars. Bonhams is hosting an auction of ""Slowhand's"" gear in New York. I really should be there and as a responsible parent make some investments for my children's futures. Now nobody should take financial advice from a washed-up, failed rock guitarist like me. But if you will just go with me on this, I do think I may be onto something. No doubt, vintage guitars made by the right company, at the right time, and played by the right people, are a serious investment opportunity. Headlines were made in 2004 when Clapton's Blackie guitar sold for $959,000. Actually that guitar broke one of the usual rules for collectors because it was not all original. He had swapped parts from other guitars, which usually kills the resale value. But what it did have was provenance. And what provenance. This was the guitar that Clapton had used over two decades, both in the studio and on stage. It also had a lot of people who wanted to buy it -- baby boomers who grew up with Clapton, the provider of soundtracks for their lives. And you can own the very guitar he played those tunes on? If you had just under a million bucks burning a hole your pocket it would be crazy not to. There is nothing that iconic at these sales, but there is a range of very tasty Clapton stuff. Beyond guitars there are amplifiers (also very collectable), stage clothes and other memorabilia. As an investment, provided you avoid bidding frenzy, these would be instruments of unquestioned authenticity, many of which have been used on record and in public performance by a star who has been making music and selling out concerts for nearly 40 years. The money Clapton raised in these sales goes to the Crossroads Centre, which he founded, which treats drug and alcohol addiction. So, it's for a good cause, it's a good investment, and you finish up with a really cool guitar. Guitars can be a great investment. Key vintage Fender guitars more than doubled in value in the last decade. If you have an original ""Strat"" from the 1950s or early 1960s in what as known as a custom color (taken from popular auto colors of the period), you could be looking at a value of up to $50,000 -- not bad for something that would not have cost more than $100 when new. Of course most people who bought them back then did not do so thinking they were long-term investments so parts were changed, the finishes were battered and repainted and value was subsequently diminished. I bought a 1961 Strat all original expect for having been stripped down to the wood. It cost between half and a third of what it would have done if the paint had still been on. Now there is a thriving trade in so called ""relic guitars"" which are new but treated to give the impression of a battered old road warrior. Worrying, there are also a lot of guitars being sold as original vintage pieces, which have had parts changed out. The money involved makes it worthwhile for the fakers who go to great lengths to disguise the changes. So the buyer beware, and always seek out what provenance and guarantees you can. There is one guitar that is the Stradivarius for collectors. It is the Gibson Les Paul Standard, made between 1958 and 1960. If you had bought one back then -- and you may well have got a discount because it was not a big seller at the time -- you would now be sitting on a guitar which can change hands for well in excess of $250,000. How does that happen? Well, it brings us back to Clapton. He played a Les Paul on an album by John Mayall and Blues Breakers. The recording is legendary among guitar players. Suddenly the discontinued Les Paul was in demand. Its value rose, and then soared as it was adopted by one superstar after another. We are talking Keith Richards, Fleetwood Mac's Peter Green, Led Zeppelin's Jimmy Page. Music world honors Les Paul . Clapton's Les Paul is thought to have been stolen while he was in rehearsals with his band Cream. Now if that ever showed up, Blackie might well end up being the second most valuable guitar sold in open auction. So if you want to buy a vintage guitar and have a partner who takes an alternative perspective, point out you are doing it for them, for their future. And if you find yourself bidding against some heavy set, balding guy, who looks like he knows he really should not be there, give him a break and let him win.","Bonhams auctioneers selling more than 70 Eric Clapton guitars .

"Tokyo (CNN) -- Students in many districts across Japan brushed off their uniforms and shouldered their bookbags for the first day of the new school year on Wednesday. But while most were worried about meeting their new teachers or what their class schedules might be, some were facing the threat of nuclear contamination or the loss of former classmates. In Tokyo, a group of students evacuated from the Fukushima area began the school year in a new city and a new classroom. Keisuke Takahashi, 7, is one of several children staying at a youth center in Japan's capital as their parents in the north work or take care of worse-off family members. ""I just got a letter from my mom,"" he said. ""It says that she is hurting because we're separated. But she says don't worry, we will go home together after the nuclear power plant settles down."" ""I haven't got used to the life yet, because I have to live separately from my mom,"" he said walking into the Minamisuna Primary School. ""I miss her."" Up in northern Japan, where the worst devastation from last month's tsunami occurred, the new school year has been delayed several weeks. Dozens of schools were wiped out or too badly damaged to reopen in Miyagi prefecture. Governments and educators are scrambling to repair schools, round up teachers and cope with the tens of thousands of displaced people. A different set of problems in Fukushima, where authorities have begun testing schools, kindergartens and playgrounds across the prefecture after parents expressed worries about high levels of radiation. Teams of researchers will monitor 1,428 locations over three days ending Thursday to try to reassure the public about safety outside the 20-kilometer exclusion zone around the damaged Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. The testing coincides with the beginning of the new school year in the prefecture, as tens of thousands of students return to classes. ""As the elementary schools starts on April 6th, we've heard many of the concern from the parents whether the schools are safe enough to have their children to attend,"" an officer at Fukushima Disaster Management told CNN. ""In response to it, we conduct to check radiation level to secure the (safety) of the children."" Authorities have announced repeatedly that there is little danger of contamination in the region, but there are monitoring stations across the country on watch. Government surveys are being taken several times daily by authorities from the area directly surrounding the damaged reactor, focusing on radiation ""hot spots"" such as ponds, low spots and drains where snow runoff and wind would naturally concentrate radiation. The spots with the highest levels of radiation Wednesday were just northwest of the plant, outside the 20-kilometer zone, with one spot registering 50.9 microsieverts. In comparison, the J-Village emergency site where workers are stationed at the cusp of the 20-kilometer zone showed a reading of just 1.1 microsieverts. A person in a developed nation is naturally exposed to about 3,000 microsieverts a year. The readings fluctuate over the day and change with wind patterns, but could also be showing that small amounts of radiation from debris and dust continue to come from the reactor site. No information is being released for sites inside the exclusion zone. The information, compiled by the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT), may eventually help create a ""minefield map"" of spots and transportation routes that are better to be avoided or closed off to the public. And in Tokyo, the radiation level has been dropping over recent days, as low wind speeds have limited the scattering of radiation from the north.

"Madrid, Spain (CNN) -- An African man who claimed he could double your money simply by applying a magic  potion to currency notes has been arrested at a Madrid bar where the Ecuadorean owner nearly  fell victim to the ploy, Spanish national police said on  Thursday. Police arrived in time to catch the suspected thief,  from Cameroon, with 1,120 euros ($1,556) that had been handed over by the bar  owner. The suspect, 28, alleged he had run out of magic potion and would need to  go home to get some more, a police statement and spokesman  said. ""It was a very unpleasant surprise,"" bar owner Cesar Tepan told CNN. He told police the suspect had come to the  bar a week earlier claiming he could double currency notes by applying a magic  potion, the police statement said. Taking a chance, the owner provided a 20 euro note  (nearly $28), and the suspect mixed it with various white papers, applied a  brown liquid and white power, and mixed it up with cotton. Presto, and there  were soon three 20 euro notes visible, the owner told  police. ""He returned my 20,"" said Tepan, who's lived 16 years in Spain and has owned the bar in central Madrid for 11 years. When the suspect came back last Saturday, the owner  provided 1,120 euros in various currency notes, after the owner and the suspect  agreed on how to split up the proceeds from the doubled money, the police  said. The suspect put the bills in an envelope and  sealed it with tape. Then he applied the alleged magic potion, repeating this  various times, but finally told the bar owner he had run out of the magic potion  and would need to go home and get more. But he promised to leave the sealed envelope at  the bar. That's when an argument ensued and someone, possibly the owner or a  client, called the police, a police spokesman said. ""I realized he was trying to take the money,"" Tepan told CNN. A neighbor called  the police and Tepan's adult son arrived and locked the door to the street, with  the suspect inside the bar. ""He became nervous,"" Tepan said, adding he was determined not to let the suspect  leave until the 1,120 euros had been returned. The police arrived and opened the sealed envelope but found only white papers  inside. Then they searched the suspect, and found the 1,120 euros hidden in his  clothing, the police statement said.","African man arrested at a bar by Spanish police .

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- Afghan police repelled an attack on an army recruitment center in Kandahar on Thursday, officials said. One suicide attacker died when he detonated explosives, while three others were shot and killed by police, the Kandahar province's media department said. In addition to the attackers, one person was killed and nine others were wounded, the director of Mirwais Hospital in Kandahar said. One civilian was among the wounded, said Abdul Qayum Pokhla. Zalmai Ayoubi, a spokesman for the provincial government, said the suicide attackers entered a building that was under construction and fired at the recruitment center across the street. The Taliban has claimed responsibility for the attack. Meanwhile, Afghan forces and coalition troops killed more than 80 insurgents during an anti-terrorism operation in the mountainous Kunar province along the border with Pakistan, NATO said. They also seized numerous weapons, materials for making improved explosive devices, and captured a radio station used to solicit money and direct attacks on civilians, NATO said.

"(CNN) -- The Syrian government is freeing some activists while arresting hundreds of others in its back-and-forth bid to placate protesters and crush dissent, a human rights lawyer said. Attorney Razan Zaytouni sent CNN a list Sunday naming more than 500 people she said have been arrested since the start of the unrest a couple of weeks ago. Roughly half of those people have since been released, the list shows. CNN could not independently confirm details of the report. Last week the Syrian Arab News Agency said that a wave of arrests came as government security forces were searching for members of an ""armed group"" that killed ""a number of citizen and security forces."" SANA reported that an unidentified official said snipers from the group fired at citizens and security forces from rooftops. This is disputed by activists and eyewitnesses who told CNN that government snipers fired shots at unarmed protesters and government forces beat demonstrators. Protesters in Syria are upset at what they see as the nation's heavy-handed rule. Opponents of the government allege massive human rights abuses and are calling for political and economic reform. They also want the release of all political prisoners and an end to emergency law. The emergency law allows the government to make preventive arrests and override constitutional and penal code statutes. In effect since 1963, it also bars detainees who have not been charged from filing court complaints and from having a lawyer present during interrogations. Zaytouni said she is part of a group of lawyers that has volunteered to help defend political prisoners. ""But our role is superficial. There is no judicial system in Syria and the security apparatus arrests people and send them to courts directly,"" she said. Amnesty International estimated late last month that at least 93 people were believed to have been arrested by Syrian security forces between March 8 and March 23 and held in unknown locations. The real number arrests is likely to be ""considerably higher,"" the rights group said, adding that the detained include students, intellectuals, journalists and activists. Zaytouni spoke the same day the family of an imprisoned activist said he was freed. Mohammad al-Abdallah told CNN his brother was released Sunday after more than five years in prison. Omar al-Abdallah, 26, was accused of ""taking actions and making threat(ening) statements against the state in Syria,"" his brother said. Their father remains a political prisoner, he added.","A rights lawyer says more than 500 people have been arrested in the recent crackdown .

"Tripoli, Libya (CNN) -- Opposition forces in the rebel-held city of Benghazi called for massive demonstrations on Friday to show solidarity with like-minded Libyans in the capital, Tripoli, which remains under the control of leader Moammar Gadhafi. The developments came as the leaders of the United States, France and England delivered an editorial piece to European newspapers on their vision of Libya's future. Rebels have been under intense pressure from government forces in several cities. Gadhafi's troops pounded rebel positions in Misrata on Friday, firing mortar and artillery rounds into the strategic port city, while to the west, in Tripoli, aircraft could be heard circling the city. Libyan state television, meanwhile, reported civilian casualties from Thursday's NATO airstrikes. The attacks came as the alliance chief asked for more precision fighter jets in order to avoid civilian deaths. At a NATO summit in Berlin, Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen told reporters that NATO has the necessary assets to continue aerial strikes, but the tactical nature of the fight has changed. ""Now they hide their heavy arms in populated areas, where before many targets were easier to get to,"" Rasmussen said. ""To avoid civilian casualties, we need very sophisticated equipment. So, we need a few more precision fighter ground-attack aircraft for air-to-ground missions."" With the conflict at a deadly impasse, Britain and France have been pressuring NATO to step up airstrikes. In a joint op-ed that appeared Friday in three European newspapers, U.S. President Barack Obama, French President Nicolas Sarkozy and United Kingdom Prime Minister David Cameron wrote about their vision of Libya's ""pathway to peace."" ""We are convinced that better times lie ahead for the people of LIbya,"" they wrote. They likened the fighting in Misrata to a ""medieval siege."" The White House released text of the opinion piece, which called on the Libyan troops to return to their barracks. ""Our duty and our mandate under U.N. Security Council Resolution 1973 is to protect civilians, and we are doing that. It is not to remove (Gadhafi) by force. But it is impossible to imagine a future for Libya with (Gadhafi) in power,"" the three wrote. ""The International Criminal Court is rightly investigating the crimes committed against civilians and the grievous violations of international law. It is unthinkable that someone who has tried to massacre his own people can play a part in their future government."" Gadhafi's daughter, Ayesha, speaking to a cheering crowd in Tripoli on Thursday, said the United States tried to kill her and other children in 1986. ""In 1911, Italy attacked my country and killed my (great-) grandfather,"" she said. ""Now in 2011, they're trying to kill my father."" ""My father once said that 'if the Libyan nation doesn't want me, then I don't deserve to live,'"" Ayesha Gadhafi said. ""The Libyans answered him in a united voice: 'Those who don't want you don't deserve to live!'"" Ayesha Gadhafi also said rebel forces were being wrongly portrayed. ""Who are those civilians that you're trying to protect while killing us? Are they those who hold RPGs and other weapons?"" The emir of Qatar, meanwhile, told CNN ""it's possible"" weapons provided by his state have reached Libyan rebels in the past two days. Hamad bin Khalifa told ""The Situation Room"" that the opposition first must be trained in use of the weapons. Libyan Deputy Foreign Minister Khaled Kaim accused Qatar late Wednesday of providing rebels in eastern Libya with anti-tank warheads, but he did not say when. A week ago, a CNN team in eastern Libya saw the rebels with anti-tank missiles, which they didn't have before. Rebels near Ajdabiya were beginning to show signs of discipline and have received new equipment, CNN's Ben Wedeman reported. Despite the enhanced organization, they were not ready to take the offensive. Misrata has been under siege for weeks. Reports of civilian casualties are commonplace. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said that in addition to Misrata, the situation also is particularly grave in the cities of Zintan and al-Brega because of critical food and water shortages. Rebels have pushed back the battle lines in the east from the war-weary city of Ajdabiya toward al-Brega. ""We are also deeply concerned with the fate of third-country nationals who are trapped in the areas of fighting,"" Ban said at an Arab League meeting on Libya in Cairo. ""As the fighting rages, the situation will only get worse and the more distant a political solution."" International delegates attending a meeting on Libya Thursday in Qatar again urged Gadhafi to step down immediately. But the Libyan strongman has shown no signs of backing down. State-run television aired video Thursday of Gadhafi hanging out of the sunroof of a sport utility vehicle and waving to other cars and people on the streets. CNN's Frederik Pleitgen, Ben Wedeman and Reza Sayah contributed to this report.","U.S., French and UK leaders write op-ed piece .

"Dallas, Texas (CNN) -- Some people see body painting as semi-nudity and therefore taboo. Others see it as a form of artistic self-expression. A talented few see it as a challenge. Artists from around the world raised their paint brushes in Dallas, Texas, recently with hopes of turning a human body into a prize-winning work of art at the 2011 North American Body Painting Championship. A lot of brightly colored paint was sprayed or brushed on cheeks, lips, chests, backs, arm pits, legs and feet -- and even inside ears. Each team of up to three artists -- all required to be at least 21 years of age -- worked on a human volunteer who would be turned into what looked like a fantasy creature. Because each human body is unique, that can also influence the end product, according to veteran Canadian artist Yvonne Boyd of British Columbia. ""Each person has their own unique energy and shapes. Skin textures pull out different colors in the paint,"" she said. Some of the contestants have years of experience. Others like Dallas resident Brenda Brewer, a face painter on cruise ships, was body painting for the first time. ""Its a form of expression but instead of using a canvas you are using a body as a canvas"" Brewer says. With a curvy and moving body, artists say it can be tough to keep the paint in place for long. ""The most difficult part to paint are the crease like under the arms and neck which have a lot of movement and rubs off,"" said Lymari Mittot, an artist from Mexico. Paul Malachi, a carpenter who occasionally body paints, learned a love for the art from his stepmother who is a face painter. He said body painting is growing in popularity because ""its such an attractive median for the audience, artist and models that it beckons people to look and be curious."" Casey Crowell, a baker in her unpainted life, volunteered to be a model for the first time at the competition, despite the near-nudity required. ""This the best of any form of creativity you can think of,"" Crowell said, explaining how it also gave her body a new freedom. ""The most exposed I've ever been (before) was giving birth to my son,"" she said. ""But yesterday I walked around Dallas in pasties and a thong."" Competition rules bar total nudity, but some artists feel that uninformed public perception of body painting gives their artwork a negative connotation. ""The misconception of body painting is that the models pose nude,"" said artist Amber Downs. ""They wear pasties and thongs and those get painted,"" she explained. Lisa Richardson, executive producer of the North American Body Painting Championship, said body painting is not something that should be kept hidden behind closed doors. ""It's not taboo, it's not based on sexuality. It's art that just happens to be alive"" Richardson said. She said having your own body painted can boost your confidence. ""No matter what your flaws are, paint can cover that and make you feel incredibly beautiful and make you feel strong."" At least one model agreed. ""I've become more comfortable with myself.  I know myself a little bit better,"" Crowell said.","Artists compete in 2011 North American Body Painting Championship in Texas .

"(CNN) -- Japan has suspended its annual Antarctic whale hunt because an anti-whaling group is tailing its ship, a government official said Wednesday. Hirosh Kawamura, an official at the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, said the hunt has been ""temporarily suspended"" since February 10 due to the actions of the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society. ""We have experienced the dangerous attacks from them, it might take the life of crews,"" he said. ""Considering the safety as the first priority, we decided to halt the whaling temporarily."" Sea Shepherd regularly dogs Japanese whaling vessels during their hunts to make their task more difficult and to lower the number of whales harvested. Japan annually hunts whales in the Antarctic, despite a worldwide moratorium on whaling, under the loophole that a country may legally do so if its purpose is scientific research. Sea Shepherd has said the science argument is a sham, noting that the whale meat is sold in Japan and served in restaurants.","Japan suspends its annual whale hunt after anti-whaling group chases its ship .

"Sanya, China (CNN) -- A leadership summit of five emerging economic powers took a decidedly political turn on Thursday, going beyond customary economic issues with a joint declaration against Western-led airstrikes in Libya and urging a peaceful solution to the conflict. ""We share the principle that the use of force should be avoided,"" the heads of state of Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa declared in the Sanya Declaration, which was issued at the conclusion of the annual BRICS Summit in this southern China resort city. Earlier this year, Brazil, Russia, India and China abstained from voting on a United Nations Security Council resolution that authorized a no-fly zone over Libya. By contrast, South Africa had voted in favor of the resolution. This is the third annual BRICS Summit, which adopted a new acronym after South Africa joined Brazil, Russia, India and China for the first time. Chinese President Hu Jintao chaired the one-day meeting, which was also attended by South African President Jacob Zuma, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff, Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and a host of cabinet-level representatives. This year, the BRICS countries angled for greater collective influence in political affairs. Hu, China's president, called for cooperation to increase the influence of emerging economies in international institutions such as the United Nations and the World Bank. In the joint declaration, the five countries specifically called for reform and diversification of the UN Security Council by adding more emerging economies so ""it can deal with today's global challenges more successfully."" ""We underscore our support for multilateralism and the UN system but also agree on the need for the UN, including the UN Security Council, to make it more representative and effective,"" said South African President Jacob Zuma. Indian Minister of Commerce Anand Sharma agreed. ""This platform as such can make a significant and defining contribution to the global architecture as the world is seeing a major shift,"" Sharma told CNN. The BRICS countries also agreed to use their own currencies in place of the U.S. dollar when issuing credit or grants to one another. The declaration, which called for a broad-based international reserve currency system, asserted that such a move would provide more stability and certainty for emerging economies. While the summit focused on major areas of agreement between the five countries, it was apparent that the meeting purposefully steered clear of controversial topics that still plague this diverse group of nations. Controversial issues directly related to trade, including currency valuation, were pointedly avoided on Thursday. ""As of now, there has been no debate on this issue,"" Yu Ping, Vice Chairman of the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade, told CNN on Thursday. Brazil, which has been sharply critical of the way China values its currency, avoided direct comment. ""Brazil has to do what Brazil has to do,"" said Luciano Coutinho, President of the Brazilian National Development Bank. ""We cannot expect others to take care of our problems."" Together, the BRICS countries account for 40% of the world's population, and their combined economic output neared one-fifth of global GDP in 2010. The BRICS countries are expected to pass the G-7's output by 2035, according to official statistics published by the summit. Next year's BRICS Summit will be hosted in India.","Leaders of Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa meet in Chinese resort city .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa and four city councilmen were fined for ethics violations for receiving gifts worth more than $100 and tickets to Hollywood's hottest awards shows, the city ethics commission voted Tuesday. Villaraigosa was fined $20,849 by the city commission. He had earlier been fined $21,000 by the state's Fair Political Practice Commission. In a statement, Villaraigosa said his failure to report admission to 34 of the 3,000 civic events he attended between 2005 and 2010 was ""unintentional."" He believed the tickets weren't gifts, he said. He noted the penalties were below the maximum and that he cooperated with the investigations. ""While appreciating that the Fair Political Practices Commission and city Ethics Commission concluded this was 'unintentional' and that I acted in 'good faith,' I am fully accountable. It is my responsibility to make sure I act in strict compliance with the applicable rules,"" the mayor said in a statement. ""I will continue to attend these events and have taken the necessary steps to ensure full compliance in the future,"" he added. Councilman Eric Garcetti was fined $4,800 for accepting tickets to the 2007 Emmy Awards and the 2007 and 2008 Oscars. ""While I paid the full cost of the awards show tickets,"" Garcetti said, ""I messed up when it came to the dinners afterward. That's my mistake, and I'm personally paying for the cost of these three dinners now to clear it up."" The city ethics commission fined Councilman Herb Wesson $3,900 for accepting tickets to the BET Awards in 2007, 2008 and 2009. He didn't return messages from CNN. Councilman Tony Cardenas was fined $2,500 for accepting tickets to the 2008 Emmy Awards. Cardenas told CNN that he was a member of the Academy of Television Arts and Science, and he accepted the tickets to 2008 Emmy Awards because he thought his membership in the academy justified his attendance. ""The Ethics Commission has concluded that the specific facts of this case, including lack of prior enforcement history, my full cooperation throughout this investigation and my willingness to abide by the commission's decision have resulted in a penalty below the maximum allowable fines,"" Cardenas said. Councilman Jose Huizar was fined $2,100 for accepting tickets to the 2007 Academy Awards. ""This infraction occurred in 2007 and was completely unintentional and resulted from a misunderstanding of the city's gift rules,"" said Huizar.

"(CNN) -- England's flamboyant batsman Kevin Pietersen has been fined by Australian police for speeding in a Lamborghini laid on for him by former spin-king Shane Warne. Pietersen took the $466,200 bright yellow car for a drive along the Great Ocean Road near Melbourne, Australia, thanks to former leg spinner Warne's connection with the car company. The South African-born star is currently with the England team as they take on Australia in the five-match Ashes series. He was named man of the match after making a double century last week as England won the second Test in Adelaide to take a 1-0 lead. Warne comeback talk grows . Pietersen had no problem with the Australian bowling but it was a different matter when he had to face Victoria police just hours after he updated his Twitter site to say: ""Stunning beaches on The Great Ocean Rd.. Gorgeous drive."" He was reportedly fined $235 and docked three points for driving at 121 kph by police. The England and Wales Cricket Board confirmed Pietersen had been fined, but said that he wouldn't face disciplinary action. On Wednesday he had tweeted a picture of the super car and said: ""Massive thanks to Lamborghini Melbourne & @warne888 for letting me play with this for a few days.."" England's emphatic victory in the second Test has prompted calls for Warne to make a comeback and attempt to add to the 708 Test wickets he took in a sparkling 15-year career. One group of businessman has even set up a website -- bringbackwarne.com -- to coax the 41-year-old out of retirement. Warne would only say the clamor was ""flattering."" Another high-profile sports star to fall foul of the Australian police is McLaren Formula One driver Lewis Hamilton after he was fined for anti-social driving in his Mercedes in March this year. Meanwhile in the UK, former England footballer Paul Gascoigne -- who rose to prominence during the 1990 World Cup in Italy -- has been handed a suspended jail term for drink-driving.","Kevin Pietersen fined for speeding in Melbourne, Australia .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Authorities confiscated an antique gun and some bullets from the home of Charlie Sheen after a search, the actor's divorce attorney said Friday. Mark Gross told reporters he did not believe that by having the items his client was in violation of a temporary restraining order taken out against Sheen this month. Gross said no drugs were found and police were courteous during the Thursday night search -- a sentiment authorities echoed about the actor. ""Mr. Sheen was very cooperative and we are done,"" said Los Angeles police spokeswoman Norma Eisenman. The actor took to Twitter immediately afterward, informing his 2.5 million followers, ""the LAPD were AWESOME. Absolute pros! they can protect and serve this Warlock anytime!!! c."" The restraining order was filed March 1 after Sheen's estranged wife, Brooke Mueller, requested it, alleging that he had threatened to kill her. ""I will cut your head off, put it in a box and send it to your mom,"" Mueller claims that Sheen told her late last month. The revelations were in a court document that resulted in a court order that removed Sheen's twin boys from his home. The restraining order states Sheen cannot possess, have, buy or try to buy, receive or try to receive, or in any other way get guns, other firearms or ammunition. It came to the attention of the Los Angeles police department that Sheen is the registered owner of firearms, Eisenman said, and the search was conducted to see if any firearms or ammunition were in his possession. A source close to Sheen told CNN the actor knew authorities were coming to search his home for firearms. Sheen told the source that he had no weapons there. His attorney, Gross told reporters that both he and Sheen were aware beforehand that that the search was going to occur, though Gross did not offer specifics as to when he or Sheen were notified. The attorney said he did not believe Mueller was behind the tip that led to the search. Warner Bros fired Sheen from the hit sitcom ""Two and a Half Men"" on Monday after he conducted a long-running rant against the show's producers. Warner Bros is owned by Time Warner, as is CNN. CNN's Denise Quan, Douglas Hyde and Scott Thompson contributed to this report .","NEW: Police find, confiscate an antique gun and bullets from Sheen's home .

"(WIRED)  -- Microsoft showed off a host of visual and search enhancements to its search engine Bing Wednesday, in hopes that better packaging will help it eat away at Google's online dominance. ""We are neck-to-neck in terms of search quality,"" said Bing head Satya Nadella. ""Why would an end user, if you are neck to neck on search quality, use Bing? That's the question we ask ourselves every day."" The answer the company is betting is a combination of a prettier interface, results informed by what your friends think, and focussing on helping people do things faster, whether that's finding a product review or buying an airline ticket. Wednesday's announcements includes a new mobile app for Android and the iPhone, that brings some of the design feel of Windows Phone 7 to their competitors' devices, along with some nifty maps, real time bus directions, and an easy way to make beautiful panoramas. You can also easily make reservations via OpenTable and take a virtual tour of a restaurant's interior when a restaurant shows up in map search results. Microsoft also redesigned its browser-based image search and maps, reducing the latter's reliance on the Silverlight plug-in and instead doing more with the power of modern browsers and HTML5. Traditional search also got a slight makeover, with visual changes being made to how results are returned for musical artists, destinations and movies, among other types of search. One particularly good new search result that Microsoft demoed, but which is not yet live, is for movies that are no longer playing in theaters. The Movie page for that movie will, like those for in-theater movies, show you a preview and links to reviews. But it substitutes direct, deep links to places to watch the movie online, including Netflix, for the typical showtime listings. Bing now has 11.8% of the U.S. search market, a 48% hump growth since Bing replaced Live search in the summer of 2009, according to Nadell. But even better, he said, is that Bing is now gaining adherents, particularly younger users, who like its visual emphasis, use the site regularly and perhaps, most importantly, recommend it to other people. WIRED: Picture this -- Google chases Bing . Certainly, its rival Google has taken notice of Bing's visual splashiness -- and even disastrously tried to imitate the background images on its famously sparse search home page, only to cut short the trial within hours. Google also revamped its image search earlier this year, clearly imitating Bing's innovations. While Google's visual search technology still trumps Bing's when it comes to identifying images, Bing's new UI makes it very easy to browse through large images, not just thumbnails. Perhaps most importantly, Bing now has a partnership with Facebook, and one out of five Bing users are candidates for ""instant personalization,"" since they are logged into Facebook and haven't chosen to opt-out. What that meant for searchers when the partnership launched in October wasn't much. For instance, if you search for ""how to quiet a baby"" and one of your friends on Facebook has liked one of the articles that shows up in the search results, you will see their picture next to that result. But now Bing is going further. When you search for say ""Tron"", Bing actually looks into what your friends are interested in, finds stories they have liked via little ""Like"" buttons all over the net, and then inserts that into the top results -- even if that story wouldn't have shown up in Bing's natural search results. WIRED: Firefox 4 adds Bing to list of search engines . That could turn into a huge advantage for Bing, if over time there is enough information in social networking profiles to really make search better. ""Even if only a small percentage of queries have moments where the social graph informs and improves search results, it's a huge difference,"" Nadella said, adding that it is only the beginning of using social sites like Facebook to improve search. Facebook, which sees Google as its biggest rival, is unlikely to share its core user data with Google, which itself is at work on a social add-on to its services. Overall, Microsoft's emphasis on finding new ways to group information and make doing things easier seems to be stealing a page from its old rival Apple. Design matters. Since Google's design sense heavily relies on minimalism, that leaves lots of room for Microsoft (and its search partner Yahoo) to experiment with alternative, graphics-heavy designs. Being in second place also lets Microsoft play with new visual approaches to search faster than Google can, as there are fewer users who will get upset when the location of a link moves. WIRED: Bing will add video, animation to homepage . Microsoft didn't announce anything today on par with Google's recent announcement of ""Instant Search,"" a huge engineering feat that lets users see search results before even finishing typing their query. But Microsoft showed today they are still in the lucrative search game, even if they aren't making money at it yet, and if you haven't used Bing in recent months, it's definitely worth giving it another test spin.

"(CNN) -- Andy Carroll scored twice, his first goals for Liverpool, to help his club comfortably defeat Manchester City 3-0 in Monday's Premier League encounter at Anfield. City, who needed a victory to move above Chelsea into third place in the table, were blown away by a devastating first half performance from Liverpool, who have consolidated sixth position with this result. Liverpool began brightly and nearly took a seventh-minute lead when Luis Suarez's fine strike was tipped onto the post by City's England goalkeeper Joe Hart. But the visiting defense was struggling to cope with Liverpool's wave of attacks and the hosts took a deserved lead six minutes later when Carroll's superbly struck left-footed strike, from just outside the area, swerved past Hart for his first goal since joining the club for a British record transfer fee in January. Liverpool doubled their lead in the 34th minute when City failed to clear a succession of crosses and blocked shots, the ball eventually falling to the feet of Dirk Kuyt who fired through the legs of defender Alexander Kolarov and past Hart. Liverpool made it 3-0 a minute later when Raul Meireles curled in an inviting cross from the left for Carroll to outjump Kolarov and help the ball into the far corner of the net. Liverpool had chances to increase their lead after the break but Hart did well to keep out efforts from Meireles and Kuyt, while Suarez fired wide from an acute angle and Carroll headed over the crossbar from a good position. City's defeat means they lie just three points ahead of Tottenham, who have a game in hand, in the race for the final Champions League place, with the teams still to play each other this season. A bad night for Roberto Mancini's side was made worse with the news that talismanic striker Carlos Tevez is now doubtful for Sunday's FA Cup semifinal against rivals Manchester United at Wembley, after limping off in the first half with a hamstring injury.","Andy Carroll scores his first Liverpool goals in a 3-0 win over Manchester City .

"(CNN) -- Syrian authorities have arrested at least 117 activists, intellectuals and anti-government supporters since early Monday, a human rights group said. ""The wave of arrests across the country includes journalist Faiz Sarah ... along with many more,"" Wissam Tarif, executive director of the human rights group Insan, told CNN. ""We were able to confirm only 117 arrested but we expect the number to be a lot higher,"" he added. The group said authorities raided homes and arrested opponents in the capital, Damascus, and also in the cities of Latakia, Homs, Aleppo, Jubah, Tartus and Banias. The coastal city of Banias remained sealed off Monday after violence broke a day earlier. At least four people were killed and 17 others injured in clashes between security forces and pro-democracy protesters, according to eyewitnesses. Some people ventured out Monday to bury some of the dead, with more burials expected Tuesday. Phone lines were spotty and are believed to be monitored, eyewitnesses told CNN. Electricity returned in certain parts of the city but remained unreliable. Other parts of the country also were tense as military and security forces gathered around government buildings and university campuses in anticipation of protests. In the capital, for the first time faculty members joined hundreds of students demonstrated Monday at Damascus University's applied science and law colleges in the city's central Baramka area, Tarif said. ""They were peaceful, then pro-regime forces closed off the campus and white busses came and detained at least seven people, some were beaten. One student from the city of Jassem, in Daraa province, was severely beaten inside the campus because the forces believed he organized the protest."" Tarif said. A video on YouTube.com claiming to show the protest showed students chanting slogans in support of Banias and Daraa, where the anti-government protests started in the country last month. The Syrian government blames foreigners and instigators for infiltrating peaceful demonstrations and feeding violent confrontations. The country's official news agency, SANA, published on Monday the names of six police officers who SANA said were killed and 166 others who were injured ""when militants fired at them over the last few days in Daraa, Reef, Damascus, Homs and Latakia.""","An official of a human rights group describes a ""wave"" of arrests across Syria .

"(CNN)  -- In the beginning was a word, sketched on a legal pad. And the word was Status. That was the working title used by programmer Jack Dorsey in 2000, when he designed the service that was to become Twitter six years later. An urban-design geek, Dorsey envisaged a city full of people buzzing short messages at each other the way taxi dispatchers and bike messengers do. Where are you? What's up? What's your status? Today, five years after its inception, Twitter's status seems in flux. On the one hand, it is a vibrant virtual metropolis beyond Dorsey's wildest imaginings. It has garnered 200 million citizens from every corner of the world, yet manages to be more orderly and simple than that noisy Facebook megalopolis down the road. There are no annoying Mafia Wars notifications here, no targeted ads, no anxiety-producing friend requests -- nothing but real-time messages from whomever you're interested in, be they Lady Gaga or the girl next door. On the other hand, all is not well in Status City. This week's cover story in Fortune warns that Twitter usage appears to be flatlining. One hundred million of those citizens are absent altogether, and Twitter.com has fewer visitors per month -- about 20 million -- than MySpace, according to comScore. The company has a steady hand on the tiller in new CEO Dick Costolo but lacks a visionary product leader (Dorsey is equally focused on his next company, Square). It still suffers from irritating outages and isn't turning a profit. And as CNN reported on Wednesday, UberMedia, the company behind mobile Twitter apps like Echofon, is planning to build a rival microblogging network, one that may shun the famous 140-character limit. So are the buzzards circling over Status City? Should tweeters head for the hills or prepare to move to a competing town with fewer regulations? In a word: no. The city that Jack built is a lot more robust -- and unrepeatable -- than it may seem. First of all, let's look at those numbers. They vary wildly according to which service you use and how you slice them. Quantcast says there has been a 50% jump in Twitter usage in the past five months. Most of that is overseas: Google Analytics says international traffic has risen 83% in the past year. And because so many people are tweeting on their mobile device or third party app, the Twitter.com numbers are incomplete and misleading. But even if we take the extremely conservative estimate of 20 million hardcore Twitter users, that ain't chopped liver. It's a phenomenal achievement for a 5-year-old company. These devotees could fill New York and Los Angeles combined. They ensure a neverending stream of news of every kind, perfectly customizable to your needs. You may be overwhelmed in Status City, but you will never be bored. No other service, not even Facebook, gives the impression of immersing you in a global conversation, a fact that becomes abundantly clear any time there is a natural disaster, revolution or major sporting event. As Costolo frequently says, the service has barely reached 1% of its potential. A hardcore elite of 20 million-plus also represents an unassailable lead over would-be competitors like UberMedia. Many have tried, such as Jaiku (bought and then abandoned by Google) and the now-defunct Pownce. But this isn't a medium like TV, where many channels can succeed. This is more like a network where Twitter itself contains all the channels. Barring Twitter doing something phenomenally stupid, like charging users for the service, why would you change the dial? Indeed, the only successful fellow microblogging services thus far are the ones that build layers on top of Twitter, such as Stocktwits, or open-source additions like Identi.ca. Be they gated communities or anarchic communes at the edge of Status City, they all need the vibrant metropolis itself in order to thrive. And what of that 140-character limit? Far from being a problem, it remains Twitter's greatest asset, as much as a tiny minority of users may chafe against it. In urban terms, it is the stop-light system that keeps traffic flowing -- and allows everyone to get a word in edgewise. Art thrives on constriction. Screenwriters and poets have long known that if something is worth saying, it's worth saying as briefly as possible. With Twitter, the rest of the world is finding that out. Call it the democratization of writing. Anyone can enter the elite of Status City and gain thousands of followers, if they have the wit for it. In short, the ability to churn out interesting tweets has become a much-admired skill -- the ultimate 21st-century status symbol.","Five years after its inception, Twitter's status seems in flux -- but it's actually doing just fine .

"(WIRED)  -- Apple's loose-lipped overseas partners are exchanging whispers about the next-generation iPad, claiming it will come in three different versions, one of which would work with Verizon's network. The iPad 2 will support three different wireless configurations: UMTS, CDMA and Wi-Fi only, according to ""industry sources quoted by DigiTimes"" citing component makers. That's up from the two versions Apple currently offers: UMTS plus Wi-Fi, and Wi-Fi only. To explicate the alphabet soup, UMTS is the standard used by major 3G carriers such as AT&T and T-Mobile, while CDMA is compatible with Verizon and Sprint networks. Currently the 3G iPad ships with a MicroSIM card slot, and in the United States, the only carrier that uses MicroSIM is AT&T. Customers who want to connect to non-AT&T 3G networks must either buy an external wireless hotspot device such as the Verizon MiFi (Verizon already sells a MiFi plus iPad package) or trim a standard SIM card down to MicroSIM size, like Wired.com's Charlie Sorrel. The current 3G model of the iPad is not tied to a contract: Customers pay a flat monthly rate for data and can opt out whenever they please. So if this rumor is true, it means that when the iPad 2 ships, you'll have to pick a 3G model based on your carrier preference. If you don't plan to be on the road a lot, there's still the Wi-Fi option. Support for both major wireless standards in the United States will make the iPad 2 available to a much larger potential audience, whereas before it was only available in the states from AT&T. WIRED: With iPad, Apple still has fatal attraction for AT&T . Whether Apple hammers out sales agreements with Verizon or Sprint remains to be seen. Recent rumors suggestion that the iPad 2 will hit stores April 2011, one year after the original iPad's release. Some third-party protective cases for a purported ""iPad 23 have been cropping up in Asia, hinting at the possibility of a bigger speaker and a rear-facing camera. Persistent rumors -- so far unsubstantiated -- have also pointed to a Verizon-compatible iPhone to be released in early 2011. If Verizon gets the iPhone and the iPad, it would greatly expand Apple's potential market, and would also likely deal a severe blow to AT&T, which has been roundly criticized for the inability of its 3G network to keep up with iPhone-induced demand.

"Washington (CNN) -- The chairman of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission said Tuesday that the situation in the wake of the Japanese nuclear reactor crisis is static but not yet stable. On the day that Japan bumped up the seriousness of its nuclear accident from a Level 5 to a Level 7 priority, on par with the Chernobyl disaster, a Senate committee heard from U.S. environmental officials, scientists and NRC Chairman Gregory Jaczko. ""From the information we have, we believe the situation currently is static, namely we don't see significant changes on a day-to-day basis with the reactors,"" Jaczko told the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works. ""It is not yet, however, what we believe to be stable: namely that given additional events or other circumstances ... there would not be the potential for significant additional problems at the reactors."" Thus, Jaczko said, the focus is ""on these efforts to transition from static to stable to ensure (the) long-term ... ability to cool the reactors and to provide cooling for the spent fuel pools."" California Sen. Barbara Boxer's state has a number of nuclear plants in areas with high seismic activity near millions of people. She pressed Jaczko for reassurances that enough is being done to protect people in the United States, especially California residents. ""We've got to move beyond talk and get to the serious question (of) what do we do, to do everything in our power to make it safe,"" Boxer said. Boxer pointed out that officials once said it was ""very unlikely"" Japan would ever face the kind of crisis it finds itself in today. Questions were raised at the hearing about how far to extend evacuation zones in the United States in the event of a nuclear incident. The NRC has recommended that Americans in Japan stay at least 50 miles away from the damaged reactors. The current standard in the United States is a 10-mile evacuation zone. ""As we've seen in Japan, nuclear events tend to develop over a long period of time,"" said Jaczko. ""This is three weeks into this event, and we've had the time and the ability to make protective action recommendations, and to update and modify them as conditions of the plant changed. So that 10 miles is really based around the idea of what do you need to have prepared right away so that if you have an event that develops quickly, you can address that and have prestaged and prepared what to do,"" he said. Boxer pointed out that two of the nuclear plants in California were built to withstand a certain level of earthquake, pointing out in Japan it was 7.5 but the devastating quake was much more powerful. She said nuclear regulatory officials are being too conservative. ""It's eerie to me, because I don't sense enough humility from all of us here. You know, as some great scientists once said, we think we have all the answers, but Mother Nature may not agree with us. So a lot of what you're saying is the same thing that they said,"" Boxer pointed out. ""You can't know for sure what's going to happen,"" she said. Lisa Jackson, administrator for the Environmental Protection Agency, reassured senators that air and water sampling for radiation contamination continue in the United States and that so far there is nothing to worry about. ""Let me be clear, EPA has not seen and does not expect to see radiation in our air or water reaching harmful levels in the United States,"" said Jackson. ""All of the data that we have seen, which we continue to make public and available on our website, indicates that while radiation levels are slightly elevated in some places, they are significantly below problematic levels.""","NRC Chairman Gregory Jaczko speaks to members of Senate public works panel .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Cardinal Roger Mahony visited Bryan Stow Tuesday to pray for the 42-year-old, who remains in a medically induced coma nearly two weeks after he was attacked after a baseball game between the Los Angeles Dodgers and San Francisco Giants, a hospital spokeswoman said. ""His condition remains critical and doctors are hoping Bryan's condition improves over the next 24 hours,"" said hospital spokeswoman Rosa Saca, a spokeswoman for Los Angeles County-University of Southern California Medical Center . Relatives of the Giants fan launched a website -- www.support4bryanstow.com -- in part to provide daily updates on his condition. Stow's sister, Bonnie Stow, told CNN that one priority of the neurosurgeons is keeping him sedated to prevent seizures and swelling in the brain. In a recent Web posting, she wrote: ""The doctors want to limit visitors, noise and physical contact with Bryan. They're wanting to keep his brain calm and just ... quiet ... to see how that works. ... That way the neurologists can get a better reading of brain activity. Fever down."" Bonnie Stow said her brother's seizures have subsided, and over the next 24 to 48 hours doctors want to gradually reduce the sedation he is under and, hopefully, bring him out of the medically induced coma. ""We can't wait for Bryan to wake up so he can see for himself just how much people love him, whether they are family, friends or strangers."" Since the unprovoked attack after the March 31 game at Dodger Stadium, money has poured in from numerous donors and fundraising events to help pay for medical costs and provide support for his two young children. Bonnie Stow said the website also identifies fundraising activity endorsed by Stow's family. L.A. officials ask two suspects to surrender . ""We are trying to post only legitimate fundraisers that we can confirm because unfortunately there are those trying to take advantage of this tragic situation,"" said Bonnie in a posting. At a dual fundraiser Monday at Dodger Stadium and AT&T Park in San Francisco, where the Giants and Dodgers played Monday, more than $120,000 was raised, said American Medical Response spokesman Jason Sorrick. More than $200,000 has been raised for Stow, who works for AMR. Meanwhile, investigators continued their search for the two suspected assailants, who fled after the beating in a light-colored, four-door car driven by a woman with a young boy inside, authorities said. Since the release of composite sketches, police have investigated more than 100 clues based on calls and tips, said Los Angeles Police Detective PJ Morris. About 100 witnesses saw Stow attacked as he left the stadium parking lot, and Morris said some of them have provided useful information. Officials are offering a $100,000 reward for information leading to arrests and convictions. ""Whether it's the reward money or a Good Samaritan who wants to help solve a horrific crime, there has been a tremendous outpouring of calls from people who might have useful information,"" Morris said. Morris said detectives have compiled and presented photographic lineups of possible suspects to witnesses in the Los Angeles area but no one has identified Stow's attackers. Another team of detectives has been showing the photos to witnesses in the Bay Area. ""Every call and tip is helpful in some capacity, even if it eliminates someone who may resemble the composite sketches,"" Morris said. ""There is no forensic evidence in this case, therefore that person who comes forward is most likely how we're going to solve this thing."" LAPD officials released a tip line for anyone with information: 1-800-222-TIPS (8477).","Cardinal Roger Mahony visits Bryan Stow, 42, to pray for the injured father of two .

"(CNN) -- A proposal by a coalition of Persian Gulf nations to decrease tensions between the government and the opposition in Yemen may have done just the opposite. One day after the Gulf Cooperation Council released a statement urging Yemen President Ali Abdullah Saleh to transfer powers to his vice president, thousands of protestors returned to the streets Monday for marches and opposition leaders are vowing not to back down. One eyewitness claims protesters number in the tens of thousands at a anti-Saleh march in Abyan province. CNN could not independently verify the estimate. ""The youth protesting today are being used by the JMP who are trying to steal the revolution from them,"" Abdu Ganadi, deputy minister of information for the GCC said Monday. The Joint Meeting Parties bloc, Yemen's largest opposition group, said the GCC initiative ""does not clearly state that Saleh must step down and only focuses on Saleh's transferring power."" ""We all know the VP is not strong and will never be able to tell Saleh no, even if all his powers are transferred,"" said senior JMP official Hasan Zaid. The Embassy of the Republic of Yemen in Washington responded to the GCC initiative on Monday in a statement which  said Saleh has agreed to transfer powers in accordance with the Yemeni Constitution, which means he will not step down from power until his term ends in 2013. ""We will not accept any initiative that will have Saleh still in rule whether the initiative is from the GCC or Europe,"" Zaid said. The GCC, a six-nation bloc of oil producing countries, met on Sunday in the Saudi Arabian capital, Riyadh, in an effort bring an end to the current political impasse in the country. ""The opposition wants everything and President Saleh is still the most powerful person in the country,"" GCC's Ganadi said. ""The opposition is now the one going against the GCC initiative,"" said Ganadi. A leading revolutionary attending a march on Monday in Sanaa spoke out against the coalition's proposal. ""The youth are not involved in any agreement and in the end, we have the powerful voice,"" said Khaled Anesi.  ""No initiative will save Saleh from the crimes he committed against the peaceful youth,"" Anesi said. In addition to pushing the transfer of power, the GCC's initiative also called for the formation of a national unity government to be chaired by the opposition. There was no mention of that proposal in the statement released by the Yemen government. Last week, Saleh said he welcomes the council's efforts to help resolve the political crisis in his country.  He has said he intends to step down but only under a peaceful and constitutional transition process. Despite increasing pressure from neighboring countries and opposition groups, the Yemeni government has said calling for Saleh's departure now is going too far. Yemen's president has promised not to run in the next round of elections. The United States, which has been allied with the Saleh government in its fight against al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, has welcomed past Gulf council initiatives. ""We strongly encourage all sides to engage in this urgently needed dialogue to reach a solution supported by the Yemeni people,"" Mark Toner, spokesman for the U.S. State Department, said Friday. ""President Saleh has publicly expressed his willingness to engage in a peaceful transition of power; the timing and form of this transition should be identified through negotiation and begin soon."" Violence and protest have raged in Yemen, where protesters have called for the ouster of Saleh. He has ruled the country since 1978. An eyewitness claims hundreds of protesters attended an anti-government march in streets of Sanaa, and other cities across Yemen. ""We will not be scared to march and make the regime understand that we will not stop until our demands are met,"" student activist Hareth Abdullah said. ""Every day we increase in power and the regime decreases in power,"" Abdullah said. High unemployment fuels much of the anger among a growing young population who have suffered from poverty. The protesters also cite government corruption and a lack of political freedom. ""We will not differ with the revolution youth and we will support them,"" Yahya Abu Osbaa, a senior JMP official said.  ""In the end, I can assure you that we will agree on terms,"" Osbaa said.

THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED. CARL AZUZ, CNN STUDENT NEWS ANCHOR: To our Facebook fans in Kansas, Ohio, Illinois, Pennsylvania and to everyone who's watching us around the world, welcome to CNN Student News. From the CNN Center in Atlanta, Georgia, I'm Carl Azuz. First Up: Japan Nuclear Crisis . AZUZ: First up, Japan's prime minister wants some answers from the company that runs the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. Specifically, the prime minister wants to know when the crisis at the plant is going to be over. He's looking for a timetable from the Tokyo Electric Power Company, and he says one should be coming soon. He's also promised to get this crisis under control ""at all costs."" In the meantime, the Japanese government has classified the situation at the Fukushima plant as a level 7. That means it is among the most serious nuclear accidents ever. That rating is based on how much radiation has been released from the plant, and it means officials expect long-term efforts to deal with all the issues caused by this accident. Thousands of people have had to leave the region around the plant. The prime minister promised to help them find jobs, housing and education. What's happening in Japan has some people remembering another nuclear accident that took place nearly 25 years ago. It was a meltdown at Chernobyl nuclear plant in the former Soviet Union. Diana Magnay looks at the long-lasting effects of the worst nuclear accident in history. (BEGIN VIDEO) DIANA MAGNAY, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: We're driving through the exclusion zone en route to Chernobyl. It doesn't feel like a place where the world's worst-ever nuclear accident happened almost 25 years ago. The sun lends a wintry charm to the derelict homes we passed. In all, nearly 350,000 people were forced to abandon their homes as a radioactive cloud blew over Ukraine, Belarus and Russia. This village is called Zalissya in Ukrainian, which literally means ""behind the forest."" But as you can see now, it has been completely consumed by the forest. And when the villages were evacuated about ten days after the accident took place, they thought that they'd be able to come back here, that this village would be inhabitable again. But as you can see, that wasn't to be the case. So, this is the memorial. How many people died immediately after the accident? YURI TATARCHUK, CHERNOBYL GUIDE: Answer, about 30 people in one month died overall. Highly radiated. MAGNAY: Yuri Tatarchuk, who's our certified guide from Ukraine's ministry of emergencies, says the final death toll from the nuclear fallout is impossible to calculate, but that it's less than people feared. Estimates from the International Atomic Energy Agency put the number at 4,000. But the World Health Organization points to 4,000 incidents of thyroid cancer among children from the affected areas. TATARCHUK: So now, it's 8.7, 9 microsieverts. MAGNAY: Radiation's not down to normal, but Tatarchuk says it's not a health risk if you're just here for the day. TATARCHUK: We're staying here just minutes, but it's not so sure if such levels of radiation inhabiting here is not allowed. MAGNAY: We're not the only visitors. A Russian tour group picked their way through frozen tower blocks in nearby Pripyat. The town was evacuated the day after reactor number four exploded, before the Soviet Union admitted it had a serious problem in one of its nuclear plants. This year, the government will remove restrictions to the exclusion zone, turning these Soviet ghost towns into a tourist destination, a chance for people to see for themselves the relics of a nuclear catastrophe frozen in time. Diana Magnay, CNN, Pripyat, Ukraine. (END VIDEO) What's the Word . TOMEKA JONES, CNN STUDENT NEWS: What's the word? When a government spends more money than it takes in, the difference is called a _____? DEFICIT . That's the word! Budget Battle . AZUZ: In March, the U.S. federal deficit was $188 billion. President Obama and Congress are looking at ways to reduce that deficit. Republicans laid out some ideas last week. The president is scheduled to outline his plan in a speech later today. In more immediate budget news, though, we're getting some details about the spending cuts that could be voted on this week. This is part of the deal that helped avoid the government shutdown last week. $38.5 billion in cuts would affect programs from the Transportation, Education, Labor, and Health and Human Services departments. Of course, Congress has to pass that deal before any of it would happen, and votes are scheduled for later this week. Shoutout . STAN CASE, CNN STUDENT NEWS: Today's Shoutout goes out to the social studies students and teachers at Salisbury High School in Salisbury, North Carolina! Which space shuttle went into orbit first? Here we go! Was it: A) Atlantis, B) Columbia, C) Discovery or D) Endeavour? Start the countdown at three seconds -- and GO! Columbia was the first shuttle to launch into orbit. That's your answer and that's your Shoutout! Retiring Shuttles . AZUZ: The launch happened exactly 30 years ago this week. And in honor of the anniversary, NASA is announcing where the shuttle fleet is going to spend its retirement. You'll be able to visit Atlantis at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida and Endeavour at a science center in Los Angeles. Discovery is headed to the Smithsonian in Washington. And Enterprise -- a shuttle that never actually went into space -- will be on display at a museum in New York. The 30th anniversary of Columbia's first flight was also the 50th anniverary of a major milestone for the Russian space program. Matthew Chance has more on that celebration. (BEGIN VIDEO) MATTHEW CHANCE, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT, MOSCOW: It was perhaps the greatest journey one man has ever taken. Propelled 50 years ago into space on a Soviet rocket, Yuri Gagarin made the first ever orbit of the Earth. For 108 minutes, he was crammed inside his tiny capsule, giving the world a vivid commentary of the planet far below. YURI GAGARIN, SOVIET COSMONAUT [TRANSLATED]: I am continuing the flight. The overload is somewhat increasing, as well as the vibration. But I am feeling well, and I'm in great spirits. I can see the Earth and can distinguish the features of its terrain. CHANCE: Well, this is just a replica of the actual Vostok capsule in which Yuri Gagarin made that first historic flight. For some reason, the original is kept in the museum of a state corporation and isn't on general public view. But this space exhibition in Moscow is filled with originals, including a number of contemporaries of Yuri Gagarin himself. Men like Alexei Leonov, the first Soviet cosmonaut to conduct a spacewalk, here to celebrate the achievements of 50 years ago. ALEXEI LEONOV, RUSSIAN COSMONAUT [TRANSLATED]: In the past, we used to make a point of whether he or she was an American or a Russian or whatnot. In my view, if we don't remember what happened 50 years ago, we will forget everything in 100 years. CHANCE: At the height of the Cold War, Gagarin's success was a high-profile victory over the United States, seen as evidence of Soviet domination in the space race. He was dispatched overseas in what the Kremlin called ""missions of peace."" It made him a global icon. And his flight on April 12, 1961 also led president John F. Kennedy to declare that America would put a man on the moon by 1970. Today, American astronauts are ready to acknowledge Gagarin's pioneering mission. THOMAS STAFFORD, U.S. ASTRONAUT: Well, there always has to be a first (inaudible). And at the time, you know, there was a big competition (inaudible). I will say here today, without Yuri Gagarin's flight, I probably would not have flown to the moon. CHANCE: Everybody's friends now. STAFFORD: Oh, yes. CHANCE: Gagarin didn't live to witness the hundreds who've journeyed to space since his first flight. He was killed in 1968 in a plane crash. But an untimely death has only added to the mythical status of the first man in space. (END VIDEO) Before We Go . AZUZ: Before we go, do you remember the states we mentioned at the beginning of today's show? You would if you were in this competition. It's the U.S. Memory Championship; we're talking mental muscle. The tournament involves memorizing names, faces and numbers. For one round, you have to memorize the order of a shuffled deck of playing cards. This year's champion took home the title -- and broke two U.S. records along the way -- last month in New York. Goodbye . AZUZ: We were going to tell you about it then, but then we, uh, forgot. We hope you remember to tune in for more CNN Student News tomorrow.

"Tripoli, Libya (CNN) -- Moammar Gadhafi's forces Thursday pounded the strategic port of Misrata, his sole daughter defied the coalition and the three leaders of that alliance declared the Libyan leader ""must go and go for good."" To the west, in Tripoli, antiaircraft fire followed several thunderous explosions, and Libyan state television reported civilian casualties from NATO airstrikes. The attacks came as the alliance chief asked for more precision fighter jets in order to avoid civilian deaths. At a NATO summit in Berlin, Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen told reporters that NATO has the necessary assets to continue aerial strikes, but the tactical nature of the fight has changed. ""Now they hide their heavy arms in populated areas, where before many targets were easier to get to,"" Rasmussen said. ""To avoid civilian casualties, we need very sophisticated equipment. So, we need a few more precision fighter ground-attack aircraft for air-to-ground missions."" With the conflict at a deadly impasse, Britain and France have been pressuring NATO to step up airstrikes. In a joint op-ed that will appear Friday in three European newspapers, U.S. President Barack Obama, French President Nicolas Sarkozy and United Kingdom Prime Minister David Cameron wrote about their vision of Libya's ""pathway to peace."" ""We are convinced that better times lie ahead for the people of LIbya,"" they wrote. They likened the fighting in Misrata to a ""medieval siege."" The White House released text of the opinion piece, which called on the Libyan troops to return to their barracks. ""Our duty and our mandate under U.N. Security Council Resolution 1973 is to protect civilians, and we are doing that. It is not to remove (Gadhafi) by force. But it is impossible to imagine a future for Libya with (Gadhafi) in power,"" the three wrote. ""The International Criminal Court is rightly investigating the crimes committed against civilians and the grievous violations of international law. It is unthinkable that someone who has tried to massacre his own people can play a part in their future government."" Gadhafi's daughter, Ayesha, speaking to a cheering crowd in Tripoli, said the United States tried to kill her and other children in 1986. ""In 1911, Italy attacked my country and killed my (great-) grandfather,"" she said. ""Now in 2011, they're trying to kill my father."" ""My father once said that 'if the Libyan nation doesn't want me, then I don't deserve to live,'"" Ayesha Gadhafi said. ""The Libyans answered him in a united voice: 'Those who don't want you don't deserve to live!'"" Ayesha Gadhafi also said rebel forces were being wrongly portrayed. ""Who are those civilians that you're trying to protect while killing us? Are they those who hold RPGs and other weapons?"" The emir of Qatar, meanwhile, told CNN ""it's possible"" weapons provided by his state have reached Libyan rebels in the past two days. Hamad bin Khalifa told ""The Situation Room"" that the opposition first must be trained in use of the weapons. Libyan Deputy Foreign Minister Khaled Kaim accused Qatar late Wednesday of providing rebels in eastern Libya with anti-tank warheads, but he did not say when. A week ago, a CNN team in eastern Libya saw the rebels with anti-tank missiles, which they didn't have before. Rebels near Ajdabiya were beginning to show signs of discipline and have received new equipment, CNN's Ben Wedeman reported. Despite the enhanced organization, they were not ready to take the offensive. In Misrata, at least 23 people were killed and more than 100 were wounded in the dawn attack at the port and a nearby residential area, said the director of one of the four clinics open in the city. He said at least 700 people have died since the violence erupted in Misrata in February . The attacks Thursday destroyed a cement factory and cargo containers at the Misrata port, where a medical aid ship was expected to dock, residents said. ""If people do not die here from shelling, they will die from starving since Gadhafi is preventing aid from arriving to the port,"" said Mohammed, a medical assistant. He said the shelled port had reopened and did not sustain major damage. Misrata residents interviewed by CNN did not want to be identified because of security reasons. CNN could not independently verify the reports but the International Organization for Migration said it chartered an 800-person-capacity boat to evacuate at least 6,000 stranded migrant workers in Misrata, many of whom have been living in warehouses with little food and a lot of fear. The organization said the boat was carrying hundreds of tons of medical aid to Misrata and was en route to the port. ""From reports on the ground, this rescue mission cannot come soon enough,"" an IOM worker on the boat said in a news release. ""It is going to be heartbreaking not being able to take everyone out at once."" Misrata has been under siege for weeks. Reports of civilian casualties streamed in Tuesday and Wednesday. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said that in addition to Misrata, the situation also is particularly grave in the cities of Zintan and al-Brega because of critical food and water shortages. Rebels have pushed back the battle lines in the east from the war-weary city of Ajdabiya toward al-Brega. ""We are also deeply concerned with the fate of third-country nationals who are trapped in the areas of fighting,"" Ban said at an Arab League meeting on Libya in Cairo. ""As the fighting rages, the situation will only get worse and the more distant a political solution."" International delegates attending a meeting on Libya Thursday in Qatar again urged Gadhafi to step down immediately. But the Libyan strongman has shown no signs of backing down. State-run television aired video Thursday of Gadhafi hanging out of the sunroof of a sport utility vehicle and waving to other cars and people on the streets. CNN's Frederik Pleitgen, Ben Wedeman and Reza Sayah contributed to this report.","NEW: Rebels show more discipline, cohesion in Ajdabiya .

"(CNN) -- He is someone you might want for a son. Except you can't adopt him. He's somebody else's favorite son. Derrick Rose, raised to be humble, groomed to be great, is Chicago Jr. The place that gave birth to a bouncing basketball boy is thrilled that the kid, all grown up now, is still living at home. As the human blur of a point guard for the Bulls, Rose could become the team's first player since Michael Jordan to win the NBA's Most Valuable Player award. And while Rose may never reach the level of worship enjoyed by Jordan, there's a certain love for Rose that Jordan never knew. A love only a parent can give. You see it nightly at the United Center, feel it in warm applause, sense it in a basketball season that's going Chicago's way. Rose justifies all the fuss with performances that manage to entertain fans and win games, a combination that makes him worth the price of admission alone. Really, what's not to love about a player with the speed necessary to reach the rim, and an improved outside shot that makes him deadly from 20 feet, and an air of confidence that has him and the city thinking anything's possible? Here on the eve of the playoffs, where the Bulls will enter as the No. 1 seed in the East, he's pumping 25 points a game, good for seventh in the league, which would be fine if that was the whole story. But it is not. He was born in one of the armpits of Chicago, a 'hood that would make Al Capone flinch, a place where kids like Rose don't need a GPS to find trouble. A quick pair of fists come in handy where Rose comes from, but best we can tell, all he ever beat up were stereotypes. Let's just say he doesn't carry himself in a way society has come to expect from young men raised on That Side Of Town. Ego and me-me attitude? Oh, sure, he has one. Like any star who makes grown-ups slobber all over themselves, Rose brings a list of demands. A list the size of a postage stamp. And there's only one item on it: He asks for access to the Bulls' practice facility at all hours because sometimes the urge to work on his game dawns upon him at the break of dawn. Take last summer. After spending an entire day at his youth camp -- and you don't know the definition of ""exhaustion"" until you've worked with a few hundred boys with short attention spans -- Rose recuperated by shooting jumpers for a few hours at the team gym. And the season was still months away. ""I just want to win games and be true to my family, team, my teammates and the city,"" Rose said. ""They've all given me so much."" Just recently, on a day off, he drove himself to his old high school to watch a few buddies in a pickup game. Yeah, that sounds exactly like what a famous 22-year-old athlete would do for a thrill in a city like Chicago. ""He had a great time,"" said Robert Smith, Rose's old coach and still the current coach at Simeon Academy. ""It was a big deal to the kids at school but no big deal to him. He's just that way."" Rose will deliver a magnificent game, for example his 39-point effort against Orlando just last Sunday, and then rave about a screen set for him by a teammate. At the All-Star Game in Los Angeles two months ago, when Lenny Kravitz and a smoke machine introduced each player in a Hollywood-style opening, Rose gently waved and smiled slightly and quickly walked off the stage, looking somewhat embarrassed by the attention. In a sports era where players love to pull their jersey to celebrate a big basket, Rose pulls no stunts. No chest-thumping or fist-pumping or shimmy-shaking. He does not teach anyone how to Dougie. He leaves the screaming to the fans. ""He's just a grounded guy,"" said John Paxson, the Bulls' executive vice president of basketball operations. ""The things that are most important to him are family and basketball."" If it seems Rose was made for this, that's because he was. When he began to outplay high school kids at age 7, the process began in earnest. His mother, a single parent, put her three oldest sons in charge of Derrick. They formed a brotherly shield around him, blocking out all unwanted intrusions, especially the aggressive reptiles known as street agents. At least one brother shadowed him everywhere: to and from school, games, practices and parties. They didn't want Derrick to fall through the cracks, to end up another sad statistic. Or to become an innocent victim like Ben Wilson, the famed Chicago schoolboy who was gunned down decades ago before he graduated from Simeon. ""The manner in which he was raised while he was little gave him a great perspective on life,"" Paxson said. Derrick chose to wear Ben's number, 25, and continue the slain player's journey as a tribute. With his brothers' help, he stayed straight and avoided the most vicious double-team a young player can face: temptation and trouble. Perhaps he was protected too much; his SAT score was voided over suspicions that someone took it for him. Rose has always denied this, but after taking Memphis to the NCAA title game as a freshman, that season was wiped from the books by the NCAA. Rose went to the NBA where, fate had it, the hometown Bulls awaited. ""I was happy, because there was only one team I really wanted to play for,"" Rose said. Not many local players get the chance to start their career, or spend most of it, with the home team. Some of that is merely by chance; Rose just happened to be the best player in college basketball and the Bulls owned the No. 1 pick in the draft. But some teams are allergic to drafting or trading for locals because they worry about the demands placed on the player: old blood-sucking friends and pressure to play well. When these players fail spectacularly the way Stephon Marbury did in New York with the Knicks, they crumble twice as hard. They're not locals anymore; they're home-groan. ""A lot of these guys didn't grow up in the best areas, and didn't have the best influences in their lives,"" Paxson said. ""Sometimes you bring them back to that element, where people are trying to get something from them. Once we delved into Derrick and his family, if there was going to be an element, it would be handled. His brothers are still around and watching very carefully what's going on."" They're not the only ones. We're all watching what's going on: the early evolution of a star who's taking his status in stride. The most recent example of a local who became a hometown star was LeBron James spending seven seasons with the Cleveland Cavaliers (LeBron's from Akron, not Cleveland, but close enough). And we saw how that turned out. LeBron is welcome in Cleveland like a Steelers Super Bowl trophy. ""One of the things that impresses me about Derrick is he feels the responsibility to be the best, and to carry himself as a great player would,"" Paxson said. ""He understands the position he's in and what's expected of him from his coaches, teammates, the organization and the community. There are some young players in this league who understand the right way to play the game, who are professionals and who are fantastic role models for this league. He's one of them. He gets it."" Before each home game, when the Bulls' starting lineup is introduced, the players are announced by position and where they attended college. With one exception. Rose is also announced as being from Chicago. ""There's a sense of pride involved, and it teaches something to young people around here,"" Paxson explained. ""It's a story of a guy who didn't grow up with much. With the help of his family, he rose from grim circumstances. That's something people here need to look at, and also emulate.""","Powell: Chicago native Rose was born in ""a 'hood that would make Al Capone flinch""

"Washington (CNN) -- If you're one of the millions of Americans who get even a portion of your electric power from a nuclear generating plant, for more than three decades you've been paying a tax, whether you realize it or not, to fund the storage of nuclear waste from that plant in a safe place. Collected at an estimated $750 million a year, the Nuclear Energy Institute now says this so-called ""nuclear waste fund"" amounts to close to $30 billion. And it is not being used to pay for the storage of a single ounce of spent nuclear fuel. ""The government has made much more of a mess than it should have been,"" Jay Silberg, a Washington lawyer, told CNN. Silberg represents many of the nation's biggest nuclear power companies and for more than 20 years, he's been involved in lawsuits against the government, trying to make it pay for what he says it promised to do way back in 1982. ""That program, when it was set up, was supposed to be science-based,"" he says. At one point, all of the nation's spent nuclear fuel -- at least the spent fuel used for commercial power generation -- was supposed to end up at a bleak spot in Nevada, about 90 miles north of Las Vegas, called Yucca Mountain. Since the project began, the government has spent close to $11 billion in construction, engineering and scientific studies and there have been several blue ribbon commissions examining the safety of Yucca Mountain to hold all that waste. What happened? ""Rather than let the science take its course, politics has interfered and the plug has been pulled on Yucca, at least so far,"" Silberg told CNN. And by politics, he means politics at the highest level. Almost from the start, Nevada politicians said they wanted nothing to do with the Yucca Mountain Project. But it wasn't until Barack Obama began his presidential campaign that Nevada's opposition gained serious traction. Obama wrote to a Las Vegas newspaper, The Review-Journal, in the spring of 2007 saying he had ""always"" been against storing nuclear waste at Yucca Mountain. And then after he became president, Obama killed nearly all of the essential government funds for Yucca Mountain. And he did one more thing. Obama appointed Gregory Jaczko as chairman of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the government agency with the power to regulate the nation's nuclear plants and with oversight over Yucca Mountain. Jazcko (pronounced ""Yaz-Koh"") served for years as chief of staff to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada, who vowed never to allow Yucca Mountain to proceed. The offices of Sen. Reid and Jaczko told CNN that the nation's spent nuclear fuel is safe right where it is, strung out across 65 storage sites nationwide. That spent fuel ...tiny uranium pellets surrounded by steel rods coated with a zirconium alloy all packaged in a highly engineered assembly... now totals more than 70,000 tons nationwide. Two thirds of that spent fuel, according to the Nuclear Energy Institute, is now in pools under about 40 feet of water. Some anti nuclear organizations say those pools are too jammed with spent fuel rods and are vulnerable to accident or terrorist attack. The nuclear industry says the spent fuel is safe and NRC officials say they believe the spent fuel can be reliably stored where it is for another 40 years. CNN wanted to visit Yucca Mountain to see what's become of the project. The most recent television footage available of Yucca Mountain was taken in 2002. But officials from the Department of Energy, which oversees Yucca, declined, citing safety reasons. Some Republican members of Congress say they, too, were blocked in an attempt to visit Yucca. At a Senate hearing this week in Washington, Sen. Lamar Alexander, R-Tennessee, pointedly told NRC Chairman Jaczko that it was ""important to ask about Yucca Mountain."" ""We have collected $30 billion to pay for an eventual disposal,"" he said. ""Why not use it?""","America's nuclear waste fund has close to $30 billion .

"New York (CNN) -- Aircraft will soon shoot high-resolution photos of the Long Island, New York, beach area where the search for a missing woman has led to the remains of at least eight people. Airplanes and helicopters will begin circling the barrier island beach later this week as federal, state and local search efforts continue, Suffolk County Police Commissioner Richard Dormer told reporters on Wednesday. ""The high-resolution technology should be able to provide a detailed representation of the area and will extend through Nassau County,"" Dormer said. ""We're hoping the technology will help identify skeletal remains that may still be out there."" The aerial imagery will supplement police-dog search units, which expected to resume searching later this week. Meanwhile, diver teams are already scouring the waterways on the north side of the barrier island. Eight different sets of confirmed human remains have been found in Suffolk County, Long Island, since December, in what police say could be the work of a serial killer or killers. Additional remains -- including a human skull -- were uncovered Monday. Police have not said whether the latest remains are from different people, or if they could have come from the eight victims. Some of the remains found Monday in a Nassau County wildlife preserve were wrapped in a ""black plastic product"" similar to a plastic bag, a law enforcement source said Wednesday. The remains ""appeared to be part of a lower extremity,"" the source said. Medical examiner investigators are trying to determine the age and sex of the remains and attempt to find out how long they were at the location before being discovered. Federal agents first joined police in their investigation in December, after four bodies had been found. That discovery on a quarter-mile stretch of Oak Beach indicates that ""they were dumped there by the same person or persons,"" Dormer told reporters at the time. ""It's too coincidental that there were four bodies in the same location."" They were all found stuffed in bushes along an isolated strip of waterfront property. The grisly find occurred as police searched for 24-year-old Shannan Gilbert, who was last seen alive in May 2010 in the Gilgo Beach area. Gilbert's sisters said Shannan was an escort who was visiting a client. They said she ran from the man's house and called 911, claiming that someone was trying to hurt her. In a strange series of events, a local resident -- who lives a few miles from where the remains were found -- said a young woman who ""looked like she was partying all night"" came to his door at about 5 a.m. on May 1. ""She was screaming 'Help me, help me!' and said somebody was chasing her,"" said Gustav Coletti, who lives in the town of Oak Beach. He described the woman as a ""young, light-brown-haired person in her early 20s."" Coletti said he called 911 after opening his front door to the woman, prompting her to flee into the weeds along an embankment near his house. Moments later, Coletti said an ""Asian-looking man"" man driving a dark-colored sport utility vehicle pulled up alongside his home, looking for the woman. ""Things got out of hand at a party and I'm just looking for her,"" Coletti quoted the man as saying. When Coletti told the man that he had called police, the man said he ""should not have done that"" and drove toward where girl had fled, Coletti said. But he says it took police more than four months to question him about the incident, potentially losing crucial evidence over that time frame. Coletti later told CNN that he believes the woman he saw that night was Gilbert. CNN can not independently verify that claim. Dormer said Wednesday that he has ""no idea when the detective spoke to whomever you're talking about,"" referencing Coletti. Police said they received a written statement from Coletti in June. Gilbert's body has not been among the remains identified. CNN's Allan Chernoff and Susan Candiotti contributed to this report .","8 sets of confirmed human remains have been found in Suffolk County .

"(CNN) -- The remains of a Massachusetts airman missing in action from World War II have been identified and will be returned to his family for burial, the Department of Defense said Wednesday. Army Air Forces 2nd Lt. Martin P. Murray, 21, of Lowell, Massachusetts, took off on October 27, 1943, from an airfield near Port Moresby, New Guinea, with 11 other crew members aboard a B-24D Liberator. At the time, plans were being formulated to mount an attack on the Japanese fortification at Rabaul in Papua New Guinea's New Britain Province, the Defense Department's POW/Missing Personnel Office said in a statement. The crew was assigned to conduct reconnaissance on nearby shipping lanes in the Bismarck Sea. During the mission, however, the crew was told to land at a friendly air strip nearby due to poor weather, officials said. ""The last radio transmission from the crew did not indicate their location. Multiple search missions in the following weeks did not locate the aircraft."" After World War II, the Army Graves Registration Service searched for missing airmen, including Murray, in the area, but concluded in June 1949 all of them were unrecoverable, the department said. In August 2003, a team from the Joint POW/MIA Accounting Command received information on a crash site from a citizen in Papua New Guinea while investigating another case, according to the statement. The citizen gave the team an identification card from one of the crew members and said there were possible human remains at the site. Other teams attempted to visit the site twice in 2004, but were unable to because of poor weather and hazardous conditions at the helicopter landing site, authorities said. ""Another team was able to successfully excavate the site from January to March 2007 where they found several identification tags from the B-24D crew as well as human remains."" Scientists from the Joint POW/MIA Accounting Command and the Armed Forces DNA Identification Laboratory used forensic identification tools, circumstantial evidence, dental comparisons and mitochondrial DNA to identify Murray's remains, the statement said. Murray's remains will be buried Saturday in Marshfield, Massachusetts, the Defense Department said. At the end of World War II, the U.S. government was unable to recover and identify 79,000 Americans, the statement said. Now, that number has decreased to 74,000.","Army Air Forces 2nd Lt. Martin P.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Thursday's Los Angeles Dodgers game was a ""safe"" event, police said, after security was beefed up in the wake of a March 31 attack in which a San Francisco Giants fan was seriously injured. ""We had a great safe game,"" said Los Angeles Police Department Deputy Chief Jose Perez, after the Dodgers loss. ""This is the benchmark we will have at future Dodger games."" As police talked about their efforts to add security to baseball games, Bryan Stow was still hospitalized from being beaten after a recent Dodgers-Giants game. Stow, 42, was put in a medically induced coma following the attack. About 100 witnesses saw Stow attacked as he left a stadium parking lot. The two suspected assailants fled after the beating in a light-colored, four-door car driven by a woman with a young boy inside, authorities have said. Family members said doctors have lowered Stow's sedation and are hoping he wakes up soon. ""We have received hundreds of tips, but we are far from a solution,"" Los Angeles Police Chief Charlie Beck told reporters Thursday. He appealed to those with information to come forward, saying they can do so anonymously. He showed reporters new composite sketches of the suspects. Officials are offering a $100,000 reward for information leading to arrests and convictions. There was increased police presence inside and outside the stadium Thursday. Officers were tasked with ensuring the no-tailgating rule was enforced and no fans were drinking in surrounding areas before entering the stadium, police said. In addition, increased lighting has been added to the parking lots. There were at least 38 people cited for various violations including having an open container of alcohol and drinking in public, Perez said. Perez said he had not heard of any reports of violent offenses Thursday. Dodgers owner Frank McCourt said he hopes officials can go even further and bring about changes in fans' behavior. ""We sincerely hope that the solutions we put in place here at Dodger Stadium will be used at sports and entertainment venues throughout America,"" McCourt said. Stow is hospitalized at the Los Angeles County-University of Southern California Medical Center. As of Wednesday, ""There have been no more seizures for a couple days,"" Stow's sister Erin wrote on a website launched to provide updates on his condition, www.support4bryanstow.com. Doctors have been lowering his sedation, she wrote. ""Once it's out of his system, he can be examined and hopefully (praying) he responds to commands. Or better yet, wakes up."" Stow's cousin, John Stow, told CNN affiliate KRON on Thursday, it's not known when Stow will wake up. ""Head injuries are unique,"" he said. ""Every case is different, so we're just going to be patient ... Bryan's going to do it when he's ready."" The family has said they are grateful for the outpouring of support. Since the unprovoked attack, money has poured in from numerous donors and fundraising events to help pay for Stow's medical costs and support his two young children. Giants pitcher Tim Lincecum announced on his Facebook page that he plans to contribute $25,000 to the Bryan Stow Fund. ""This was a senseless act of violence, and I wanted to help out Mr. Stow and his family,"" Lincecum stated. ""I encourage Giants fans to support Mr. Stow in a positive way and hope there are not any more unfortunate acts between fans in this great rivalry."" At a dual fundraiser Monday at Dodger Stadium and AT&T Park in San Francisco, where the two teams play, more than $120,000 was raised, said American Medical Response spokesman Jason Sorrick. In all, more than $200,000 has been raised for Stow, who works for AMR. ""We couldn't be more proud of Bryan and the way the community has rallied around him,"" John Stow said. Another event was to be held in the San Francisco area Thursday. CNN's Stan Wilson contributed to this report.","NEW: Giants pitcher says he'll donate $25,000 to injured fan fund .

"(CNN) -- Investigators and community members in Tennessee continued their hunt Sunday for a 20-year-old nursing student, offering a fresh appeal for tips on the man they believe forcibly took her from her home last week. Holly Bobo was on her way to school when her brother saw her being led from their Darden, Tennessee, home into the woods by a man wearing camouflage, said John Mehr, special agent in charge for the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation. Mehr's state agency urged people Sunday ""to take notice of anyone whose whereabouts were unaccounted for Wednesday morning, when Holly went missing, and changes in behavior since the incident."" Police have not yet named anyone who they believe was behind the alleged kidnapping. ""It's possible the suspect missed work or appointments last Wednesday, Thursday or Friday unexpectedly,"" the bureau of investigation said in a statement. ""He may also have excessively cleaned a car or ATV, suddenly sold a vehicle, or reported it stolen. The suspect may be showing signs of anxiety or stress."" The community, which is near Parsons, is offering $25,000 for information that helps authorities locate Bobo and/or arrest her alleged abductor. While authorities have backed away from their earlier assertion that Bobo was dragged away, they do not believe she went willingly either. ""We feel she was in fear of her life so she was compliant with his demands,"" Mehr has said. As of Sunday, the investigative bureau said law enforcement had gotten more than 250 leads. Search teams were combing for evidence in parts of Decatur and Henderson counties, including in Natchez State Park. On Saturday, the state agency had said teams were looking in parts of Henry, Carroll and Benton counties. Decatur County Mayor Michael Smith told CNN's Brooke Baldwin on Friday that new evidence had been found in the search for Bobo, who was taking nursing classes at a Tennessee Technology Center campus in Parsons. Smith wouldn't elaborate on what type of evidence was found, but CNN has learned that a white lunch box was found near a creek eight miles away. Bobo is 5 feet, 3 inches tall and weighs about 110 pounds. She was last seen wearing a pink shirt and light blue jeans. The case has galvanized many in the rural central Tennessee community, which is roughly halfway between Memphis and Nashville. Hundreds of volunteers -- some on horseback and foot, others on all-terrain vehicles -- have turned out in recent days to hunt for clues, while many more have attended memorial services or offered supportive thoughts online via several groups on Facebook. ""We're just all close,"" one volunteer, Bryan Smith, told CNN affiliate KSMV. ""Everybody's close in this town and the county."" Her parents, meanwhile, have struggled to come to grips with their daughter's disappearance. Her mother, Karen Bobo, cried throughout her husband's brief statement to reporters Thursday and then spoke directly to Holly and whoever might know what has become of her. ""Holly, I love you so much. Please try to get home to us."" Karen Bobo said. ""She's ... so precious, you just don't even know. I just want her back.""","NEW: A volunteer looking for the woman says of the community, ""We're all just close""

"(CNN) -- President Robert Mugabe said Thursday that Zimbabwe will go ahead with the takeover of foreign-owned companies, a scheme that has rattled investors, and warned Western countries to stop interfering in his country's affairs. ""We proceed with our indigenization and empowerment policy, and programs must be worked out to ensure that our resources are managed by us, they are controlled and exploited by us, and that they benefit the majority of our people,"" Mugabe said in an hourlong speech at the burial of the deputy director of the nation's intelligence organization. For most of the time, Mugabe, 87, was speaking off the cuff in his vernacular Shona language without reading his prepared speech. Zimbabwe's indigenization law, described as ruinous by Mugabe's partners in the country's fragile coalition, compels foreign firms to cede at least 51 percent of shareholding to black locals. The former guerrilla leader said the process will go forward, starting with mines. The policy has been opposed by his coalition partner and political foe, Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangirai of the Movement for Democratic Change. The two-year-old coalition government of the resource-rich state published regulations in March giving mining companies 45 days to set out their plans for transferring ownership stakes to ""indigenous"" Zimbabweans. ""If our economy is controlled by outsiders, similarly the politics will be controlled by outsiders,"" added Mugabe, who has been at loggerheads with the West after it imposed targeted sanctions on him and senior officials of his Zanu PF party in 2002, following reports of human rights abuses and rigged elections. ""We don't worry ourselves about the goings-on in Europe, about the unnatural things happening there, where they turn man-to-man and woman-to-woman,"" Mugabe said. ""We say, well, it's their country. If they want to call their country British Gaydom, it's up to them. That's not our culture. We condemn that filth. We get alarmed when these countries have the audacity to schedule us as an item to discuss in their parliament."" He urged his supporters to ""unite in opposing and condemning the sanctions"" that he blames for the country's economic freefall. ""We must demonstrate that we are ready to defend our country and sacrifice our lives. The enemy will try by all means to destroy us, but if we are united, we are strong,"" he said. Without mentioning his political rival, Tsvangirai, by name, Mugabe said ""some of us"" have been asking the West to keep the targeted sanctions in place. Mugabe's appearance Thursday was keenly watched by observers after his return at the weekend from his fourth trip to Singapore since the end of December. Officials have confirmed that he has undergone medical treatment there on previous visits. Reports said that two weeks ago, at a meeting of Southern African leaders in neighboring Zambia, Mugabe was transported around the venue in a golf cart, looking exhausted. But Thursday, Mugabe appeared energetic for an 87-year-old as he walked to around the gravesite unassisted.","Zimbabwe President Mugabe says the takeover of foreign-owned companies will go on .

"(CNN) -- World number one Rafael Nadal and second seed Roger Federer are through to the quarterfinals of the Monte Carlo Masters after straight sets victories on Thursday. Top seed Nadal, who is aiming for a remarkable seventh successive win on the Monaco clay, saw off local favorite and 13th seed Richard Gasquet 6-2 6-4 in 93 minutes. ""I'm very happy how I played today,"" Nadal told the official ATP Tour website. ""I think I played much better than yesterday. ""In general, I think it was a very positive victory against a very difficult opponent,"" continued the Spaniard. Gasquet, who hails from nearby Nice, has now lost all his eight matches against Nadal, who is unbeaten in Monte Carlo since 2003. Federer was also in impressive form as he cruised past 15th-seeded Croat Marin Cilic 6-4 6-3. ""Today was another solid performance, which I'm very happy about. I'm happy that I'm solid on my serve,"" said the Swiss. ""That allows me then to get an opportunity, when I'm returning, which could be the set if I can then break,"" he added.

"(CNN) -- A Syrian soldier was killed in the restive city of Baniyas on Thursday, Syria's official news agency said. But an activist says he is hearing that the soldier was shot by a secret police sniper in an effort to frame demonstrators in the city. ""An armed group of snipers opened fire today on a number of elements in the army while they were patrolling in the city of Baniyas,"" the Syrian Arab News Agency said. The slain soldier was identified as Fadi Issa Mustafa. Another identified as Tayseer Omran, was wounded by a ""criminal group,"" the news agency said.

"(CNN) -- There are few careers that can match the pedigree of Real Madrid coach Jose Mourinho. Having just set a remarkable nine-year unbeaten home league record -- which spanned 150 matches and four clubs in four different countries -- the Portuguese manager is eyeing yet another remarkable record. As he leads his Real side in the quarterfinal second leg against Tottenham Hotspur tonight, Mourinho is on the trail of becoming the first coach to win three European Cups with three different clubs. But as the 48-year-old aims to push his career to the next level, there may be the birth of a new star in his midst. It was merely a coincidence that Porto clinched their 25th title as Los Merengues were shocked by Sporting Gijon at the Bernabeu -- Mourinho's first home defeat in nearly a decade -- but what is not coincidental is the way Porto have dominated their domestic championship this season. In a fashion not seen since the heady days of Mourinho between 2002 and 2004 -- when the self proclaimed ""Special One"" plundered two league titles, the UEFA Cup and the Champions League -- the youthful, dynamic and ambitious coach Andre Villas Boas has swept all before him. Will Mourinho's record ever be beaten? Villas Boas is Mourinho's protege and student, but aged just 33 -- seven years younger than Mourinho was when he won his first title with Porto -- the question is whether the apprentice can match his former master's astonishing achievements at the Estadio do Dragao. Porto have simply outclassed their rivals this season, winning 23 and drawing the other two of their 25 matches to wrap up the title with five games remaining. Along the way, they have scored 61 goals and conceding a miserly 11, and are also through to the quarterfinals of the Europa League -- a competition Mourinho also won, under its former guise of the UEFA Cup, in his first full season. ""I can find similarities between Villas Boas and Mourinho in the way they started their careers and the way in which they reached immediate success at Porto,"" Rui Orlando, a football commentator for Portuguese-based SportTV told CNN. ""Furthermore, both of them were not known as players and started coaching very early on, working with some really well known coaches."" CNN Sport anchor Pedro Pinto, who has followed the careers of both men closely, is even more forthright in his comparisons of the pair. ""There is no doubt in my mind that Villas Boas is the second coming of Jose. He is is a young, ambitious, disciplined football lunatic, who has soaked up as much knowledge as he can from working with the best coach in the world."" It is impossible not to draw comparisons between the two men. Mourinho learned his trade working as an interpreter for Bobby Robson at both Porto and Barcelona, picking up tips from the legendary English coach before eventually impressing with his own coaching acumen. Villas Boas was also at Porto in the mid 1990s. At the tender age of 17, and with no football apprenticeship behind him, his mastery of English and attention to detail impressed Robson so much that the veteran coach hired the teenager to work as part of his scouting and statistics team -- sending him to Scotland to achieve his first coaching badges. And when Mourinho returned to Porto, after cutting his managerial teeth at Uniao Leiria, he took Villas Boas under his wing, going on to employ the willing student at both Chelsea and Inter Milan in exactly the same manner as Robson had done with him. Like Mourinho, Villas Boas started his coaching career at a small club. Leaving his mentor behind in Italy, Villas Boas took over at bottom of the table Academica last season, performing a minor miracle to steer a club, without a win before his arrival, to mid-table respectability. Porto, looking for a coach after sacking Jesualdo Ferreira following their failure to retain the league title and qualify for the Champions League, quickly came a-calling -- and Villas Boas has more than justified the decision to make him the youngest coach in the Portuguese top flight, with the club suffering just one defeat in all competitions. ""He has had a very strong impact at the club, in the city and in the region,"" continued Orlando. ""He came in after a disappointing season and immediately asserted himself with a positive and confident attitude. ""His philosophy is similar to Mourinho when he was at Porto. He likes to play attacking football based on ball possession and forcing opponents into submission and his planning is superb. He spends countless hours in his office  sourcing information to give to his players."" And Pinto believes Villa Boas will go on to even greater success in the coming years. ""His strength is not only tactical, it is his ability to program players into doing exactly what he tells them to do. ""His organizational and motivational techniques are so good that players really believe they can do what he tells them."" Even within the pantheon of great football coaches, there are few who have won titles before their 40th birthday; even Mourinho fails to make the grade. But with Villa Boas claiming silverware at such a young age, maybe ""master"" Jose should beware of the burgeoning talent of his pupil.","Andre Villas Boas is following in the footsteps of his mentor Jose Mourinho .
Villas Boas has led Porto to the Portuguese title at the age of just 33 .
Mourinho was seven years older when he won his first league title with the club .
Both men are motivated, ambitious and superb at organizing their players ."
"(CNN) -- An Arizona judge agreed Wednesday with defense attorneys that prosecutors in the manslaughter trial of self-help author James Ray improperly withheld evidence, but he decided not to grant a defense motion for a mistrial. Ray is accused of manslaughter in three deaths at his October 2009 ""Spiritual Warrior"" retreat in the desert. Kirby Brown, 38, of Westtown, New York, died that night. So did James Shore, 40, of Milwaukee. Volunteer Lizbeth Marie Neuman, 49, of Prior Lake, Minnesota, died nine days after the ceremony. At least 15 others who took part in the sweat lodge ceremony became ill. More than 40 others were uninjured. Prosecutors argued that the lodge -- made of willow trees and branches, and covered with tarpaulins and blankets -- was heated to a perilously high temperature, causing the participants to suffer dehydration and heatstroke. Defense attorneys filed a motion Monday accusing prosecutors of intentionally withholding a report from environmental expert Richard Haddow, which suggests that the faulty design of the sweat lodge caused or contributed to the deaths. ""At issue is a report, or an e-mail, drafted by an environmental engineer that states two relevant factors,"" defense attorney Luis Li told Judge Warren Darrow during Wednesday's hearing. ""One, that carbon dioxide, not heat stroke, is a possible cause of death. ... And secondly, that various environmental conditions created by the design of the sweat lodge -- for which Mr. Ray has no responsibility -- could have contributed to those deaths."" Li told Darrow that prosecutors' response to the motion was ""aggressively unrepentant."" Defense attorneys contend that a ""Brady violation"" has taken place. A Brady violation occurs when the failure to disclose material exculpatory evidence to the defense deprives a defendant of a fair trial. Exculpatory means the evidence could be used to establish a defendant's innocence; material means the evidence is relevant and significant. Prosecutor Bill Hughes said the state doesn't believe that the conduct met the criteria for a Brady violation. ""It was not disclosed due to an oversight,"" Hughes said, adding that the state has turned over thousands of pages of information. Darrow said he agreed that a Brady violation had occurred but declined to grant a mistrial. The trial is set to continue Thursday. Haddow's findings were in a report that was e-mailed to lead detective Ross Diskin almost a year ago, on April 29, 2010. Ray's attorneys first learned about Haddow when he was listed as a potential witness in late October. Since November, they say, they asked prosecutors for Haddow's report four times. They got it last week. Though the state decided not to call Haddow as a witness at the trial, Arizona's discovery law requires prosecutors to provide the expert's report. There is also an ongoing obligation by prosecutors to turn over all material that could exonerate a defendant. Because they are receiving Haddow's report several weeks into the trial, and because that testimony could have had a profound impact on their strategy, defense attorneys argue that the judge has no choice but to grant a mistrial. The sweat lodge ceremony consisted of eight rounds, with each round lasting 10 to 15 minutes. Although they were not prevented from leaving, participants have said they were told to wait until the breaks between rounds. Ray's attorneys have argued that the deaths were accidental and suggested that exposure to an unknown toxin in the lodge -- perhaps a pesticide, rat poison or something in the type of wood used to heat the rocks -- could have caused the fatalities. The event participants paid up to $10,000 to seek ""new areas of consciousness"" at the retreat, according to testimony. Many had attended previous James Ray International seminars.

"New York (CNN) -- Police and FBI agents finished searching 18 ""spots of interest"" in Long Island, New York on Thursday without uncovering additional evidence in their investigation of a possible serial killer. ""We didn't uncover anything that was noteworthy,"" said Nassau County Police spokesperson Kevin Smith. ""Most of it was debris."" Their efforts are part of a probe into suspected serial killings that have turned up at least eight bodies -- four of them identified as prostitutes -- since December 2010. New York State troopers alongside some 30 police officers from Long Island's Nassau and Suffolk counties hacked their way through the area's thick brush and bramble, using guidance from a helicopter overhead and, in some cases, using chainsaws to cut through the thick foliage. Aviation teams that flew over parts of Long Island had ""identified a significant number of items that aren't natural for the area,"" said Nassau County Acting Police Commissioner Thomas Krumpter. But as of Thursday, authorities had not uncovered any further human remains. Earlier this week, police discovered skeletal remains -- including a human skull --  prompting the widening search. Police have not said whether they are from different people, or if they could have come from the eight victims found previously. Airplanes and helicopters with high-resolution technology are being used in the search effort, Suffolk County Police Commissioner Richard Dormer explained Wednesday. "" Police also are using canine search units to scour the beaches and diver teams to search the waterways on the north side of the barrier island. But they have met obstacles. ""Canine teams have been of limited assistance,"" said Detective Vincent Garcia. ""The problem with this brush is it's so thick dogs won't even go in."" Meanwhile, medical examiner investigators are trying to determine the age and sex of the victims from the remains, and how long they were at the locations before they were discovered. ""We're going back to some of the unidentified people in our system to try to see if we can identify them so we can notify loved ones if we have their remains,"" said Ellen Borakove, a spokeswoman for the New York City medical examiner's office. ""Hopefully we're going to get some IDs and we'll find out who these people are, and then the families will know,"" she added. The remains found Monday in a Nassau County wildlife preserve were wrapped in a ""black plastic product"" similar to a plastic bag, a law enforcement source said Wednesday. The remains ""appeared to be part of a lower extremity,"" the source said. But police say the remains are not connected to the bodies of four prostitutes found near Atlantic City, New Jersey, in 2006. ""The indications we have right now is that there's no connection between the Atlantic City case and the Suffolk County case,"" Dormer said. ""There are other items connected with the two cases"" that would indicate the same killer was not involved in the slayings, he said. Dormer did not provide additional details, but said Suffolk County police officers have been in contact with their Atlantic City counterparts since the early stages of the Long Island investigation. Federal agents first joined police in the investigation in December after the first four bodies were found. That discovery on a quarter-mile stretch of Oak Beach indicates that ""they were dumped there by the same person or persons,"" Dormer told reporters at the time. ""It's too coincidental that there were four bodies in the same location."" They were all found stuffed in bushes along an isolated strip of waterfront property. The grisly find occurred as police searched for Shannan Gilbert, 24, who was last seen alive in May 2010 in the Gilgo Beach area. Gilbert's sisters said Shannan was an escort who was visiting a client. They said she ran from the man's house and called 911, claiming that someone was trying to hurt her. A man who lives a few miles from where the remains were found told CNN that a young woman who ""looked like she was partying all night"" came to his door at about 5 a.m. on May 1. ""She was screaming 'Help me, help me!' and said somebody was chasing her,"" said Gustav Coletti, who lives in the town of Oak Beach. He described the woman as a ""young, light-brown-haired person in her early 20s."" Coletti said he called 911 after opening his front door to the woman, but she fled, eventually hiding under his boat, which was elevated and parked on his lawn. Moments later, Coletti said, an ""Asian-looking man"" man driving a dark-colored sport utility vehicle pulled up alongside his home. ""Things got out of hand at a party and I'm just looking for her,"" Coletti quoted the man as saying. When Coletti told the man that he had called police, the man said he ""shouldn't have done that."" The woman then fled toward the beach and the driver pursued her, Coletti said. But he told CNN it took police more than four months to question him about the incident, an allegation that police deny. Coletti later told CNN that he believes the woman he saw that night was Gilbert. CNN can not independently verify that claim. ""I have no idea when the detective spoke to whomever you are talking about,"" Dormer told CNN.  ""If you want to see somebody after this press conference we'll certainly follow up on that."" Police later clarified that they spoke with Coletti on May 1 after he made the 911 call and several times since. Pressed for the dates of the police department's conversations with Coletti and the length of time between them, they revealed that they obtained a statement from Coletti in June but provided no further specifics. ""They never got a statement from me in June,"" Coletti told CNN. Gilbert's body has not been among the remains identified.

"(CNN) -- Manchester United's hopes of winning a treble this season ended on Saturday with a 1-0 defeat to arch-rivals Manchester City in the semifinals of the English FA Cup at Wembley Stadium. Alex Ferguson's team are on course for a record-breaking 19th English league title and have also reached the semifinals of the European Champions League, but Yaya Toure's second-half winner gave City the chance of winning a first trophy in 35 years. The Ivory Coast midfielder pounced after consecutive errors by veteran goalkeeper Edwin van der Sar and midfielder Michael Carrick allowed him the chance to drill in a low shot seven minutes after halftime. United's bid to reach the final of the 140-year-old knockout competition for a record 19th time was then sabotaged by a moment of madness from 36-year-old midfielder Paul Scholes. The former England international, the only player of the two squads actually born in Manchester, was sent off with 18 minutes left for a reckless high lunge into the thigh of City's Argentine defender Pablo Zabaleta. Ferguson casts doubt over Hargreaves future . City last won the tournament in 1969, and most recently reached the final in 1981 -- one of the modern classics which was won in a replay by Tottenham. Roberto Mancini's team will face either Bolton or Stoke in the final on May 14, with the two Premier League teams meeting in Sunday's second semifinal also at England's national stadium. The Italian urged his team not to get carried away, with the club still battling to qualify for next season's Champions League. ""We have everything in our hands. If we have the same spirit we had today, we have the fourth spot,"" he said, having molded City into contenders since taking charge December 2009 after being handed a lavish transfer kitty by billionaire owner Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan. ""Manchester City was a small team until three, four, five years ago. It's important to start to win the first trophies."" United should have taken an early lead after dominating the first half-hour, with Dimitar Berbatov guilty of two bad misses in quick succession. The Bulgarian, starting in place of suspended England striker Wayne Rooney, was first denied by quick-thinking goalkeeper Joe Hart and then belied the form that has seen him become the Premier League's top scorer this season by inexplicably scooping the ball over the bar from close range after being found by Nani's inviting low cross. City, missing injured captain and top scorer Carlos Tevez, capitalized on some slack United defending after the interval as the 40-year-old Van der Sar -- who retires at the end of this season -- made a poor clearance and then Carrick gave the ball away to Toure. Hart did well to tip a 65th-minute freekick from Nani onto the crossbar before Scholes' red card forced a reshuffle with Berbatov replaced by midfielder Anderson. Man of the match Toure was denied by Van der Sar in the final minute and City survived five minutes of time added on to reach the club's second final since winning the English League Cup in 1976. The match ended in ugly scenes as United defender Rio Ferdinand had to be restrained after Anderson reacted to City striker Mario Balotelli's unwise celebrations in front of opposition fans. Ancelotti in troubled waters at the Bridge . In Saturday's Premier League action, third-placed defending champions Chelsea moved five points clear of City with a 3-1 victory at mid-table West Brom. The London club bounced back from the midweek Champions League exit at the hands of United as striker Didier Drogba leveled the scoring after this time being given the chance to start instead of $80 million signing Fernando Torres. West Brom had led through Nigeria striker peter Odemwingie, but Salomon Kalou put Chelsea ahead in the 26th minute and Frank Lampard sealed victory just before halftime. The result eased any fears that Chelsea will not qualify for next season's top European competition, moving Carlo Ancelotti's team eight points clear of fifth-placed Tottenham -- who host United's main title rivals Arsenal on Wednesday. Arsenal can reduce United's lead to four points by beating sixth-placed Liverpool on Sunday in a match that Kenny Dalglish's team also need to win in order to beat Tottenham to the sole Europa League spot. Everton consolidated seventh place with a 2-0 victory at home to Blackburn thanks to second-half goals by midfielder Leon Osman and defender Leighton Baines, the latter a penalty. Aston Villa moved up to ninth with a last-gasp 2-1 victory at second-bottom West Ham as substitute striker Gabriel Agbonlahor headed an injury-time winner after teammate Darren Bent canceled out Robbie Keane's early opener. Sunderland, European hopefuls earlier this season, slumped to an eighth defeat in nine games as the 2-0 loss at Birmingham left both clubs in a group of four teams on 38 points -- five clear of the relegation zone. Wigan moved out of the bottom three with a 3-1 win at Blackpool that dropped the promoted home team into the danger area for the first time this season.","Manchester City through to English FA Cup final for the first time since 1981 .

"(CNN) -- The National Basketball Association fined Kobe Bryant of the Los Angeles Lakers $100,000 on Wednesday for ""offensive and inexcusable"" comments he made during Tuesday night's game, the league said in a statement. Bryant used an expletive and an anti-gay slur directed at a referee after receiving a technical foul in a game against the San Antonio Spurs. In a pregame phone call Wednesday night to Joe Solomonese, president of the Human Rights Campaign, Bryant apologized for using the slur, the commission said in a statement. ""We had a very sincere conversation in which he expressed his heartfelt regret for the hurt that his words caused,"" Solomonese said. ""He told me that it's never OK to degrade or tease, and that he understands how his words could unfortunately give the wrong impression that this is appropriate conduct. At the end of a difficult day, I applaud Kobe for coming forward and taking responsibility for his actions."" Earlier, Bryant issued a statement saying his remarks should not be taken literally. ""My actions were out of frustration during the heat of the game, period,"" he said. ""The words expressed do not reflect my feelings towards the gay and lesbian communities and were not meant to offend anyone."" But, said NBA Commissioner David Stern in a statement, ""Kobe Bryant's comment during last night's game was offensive and inexcusable. While I'm fully aware that basketball is an emotional game, such a distasteful term should never be tolerated. Accordingly, I have fined Kobe $100,000. Kobe and everyone associated with the NBA know that insensitive or derogatory comments are not acceptable and have no place in our game or society."" The Human Rights Campaign said earlier it supported the fine. ""We applaud Commissioner Stern and the NBA for not only fining Bryant but for recognizing that slurs and derogatory comments have no place on the basketball court or in society at large,"" Solomonese said. ""We hope such swift and decisive action will send a strong and universal message that this kind of hateful outburst is simply inexcusable no matter what the context."" The Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation also issued a statement supporting the decision. ""The NBA has sent a clear message to sports fans everywhere that anti-gay slurs have no place in the game,"" said Jarrett Barrios, president of the organization. ""... This decision will serve as an important precedent that will help ensure a safer, more inclusive environment for fans and players everywhere, and we look forward to continuing our dialogue with the NBA.""","NEW: In pregame phone call, Bryant apologizes to Human Rights Campaign president .

"(CNN) -- A California Republican official has apologized for sending an email that depicts President Barack Obama as a young chimpanzee. ""To my fellow Americans and to everyone else who has seen the email I forwarded and was offended by my action, I humbly apologize and ask for your forgiveness of my unwise behavior,"" Marilyn Davenport said in a statement obtained by CNN. Davenport, who is a Tea Party activist and an elected member of the central committee of the Republican Party of Orange County, said she felt the email was a joke, CNN affiliate KTLA reported. The email contains a doctored photo of what appears to be a family portrait of two adult chimpanzees posing with a young chimpanzee with Obama's face pasted on it. The caption that ran with the photo says ""Now you know why no birth certificate,"" the affiliate reported. Davenport said she would not repeat her error in the apology that included two Bible passages. ""I am an imperfect Christian lady who tries her best to live a Christ-like honoring life,"" the statement said. ""I would never do anything to intentionally harm or berate others regardless of ethnicity. So I ask for your forgiveness, for I am truly sorry."" Despite criticism, Davenport told the affiliate that she does not need to resign her position because of the e-mail. Scott Baugh, chairman of the Republican Party of Orange County, said he was surprised by the e-mail. ""There's no question the e-mail is racist. The only question is what was in Marilyn's heart, what was her intent. But I don't think there's anybody on her committee or anybody in the world really that doesn't see it as a racist,"" Baugh said on CNN's ""AC360."" Baugh said he feels Davenport should resign. ""The bottom line is being sorry for something and having a sincere apology doesn't undo the action, it doesn't stop the consequences,"" Baugh said. ""There's still consequences for what she's done and what she's done will continue to bring controversy to my party so I'm inclined to think at this time that she should still resign from the committee.""

THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED. CARL AZUZ, CNN STUDENT NEWS ANCHOR: Hey, I'm Carl Azuz, this is CNN Student News! Today's show is dedicated to Mrs. Klapperich's students in Cannon Falls, Minnesota. Thank you for your ""likes"" at Facebook.com/CNNStudentNews. Let's get today's show started! First Up: Domino Effect? AZUZ: Tunisia, Egypt, Iran, Algeria, Yemen, Bahrain. If you've been watching the news the past several weeks, you know what these countries have in common: political unrest. People speaking out against their governments, calling for changes. What's happening in that part of the world could certainly have an impact on other countries around the globe. During a speech yesterday, President Obama talked about the role that the U.S. might play. U.S. PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: What happens in each of these countries will be determined by the citizens of those countries. We do want to make sure that transitions do not degenerate into chaos and violence. That's not just good for us, that's good for those countries. AZUZ: We're seeing some of these same themes with these protests. They're often organized with social media. The focus is on government leaders or policies that have been in place for a long time. But the situations are unique. And Jill Dougherty is going to show us how the U.S. has been involved so far. (BEGIN VIDEO) JILL DOUGHERTY, CNN FOREIGN AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT, WASHINGTON, D.C.: Is this what the Obama administration hopes could be the next people's revolution? Iranian police clash with demonstrators on the streets of Tehran, and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton connects the dots with Egypt's revolution. U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE HILLARY CLINTON: We wish the opposition and the brave people in the streets across cities in Iran, you know, the same opportunity that they saw their Egyptian counterparts seize in the last week. DOUGHERTY: As Iranian police round up activists, the State Department begins tweeting encouraging messages in the Farsi language, telling Iranians we want to join in your conversation. Just days after a revolution toppled Egypt's longtime ruler, Hosni Mubarak, unrest is rippling through the region, and the U.S. is trying to figure out how to handle it. In Algeria, protesters clash with security forces and the State Department proclaims their support for the universal rights of the Algerian people, adding, these rights apply on the internet. The government of Syria puts a blogger on trial for espionage; the State Department calls for her freedom. In Jordan, the Chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff and a top State Department official meet with King Abdullah II to show support for the new government he swore in following anti-government protests. Yet nothing is settled in Egypt. Trying to muster international support, President Obama has been speed-dialing fellow leaders in Great Britain, Jordan and Turkey to help keep pressure on the Egyptian military to turn a revolution into a real democracy. Secretary Clinton called the Egyptian foreign minister and her counterparts in eight other countries. The tide of democracy opens opportunities, officials say, but a former CIA director says this is not a stack of dominoes. MICHAEL HAYDEN, FORMER CIA DIRECTOR: The challenge is how does one manage that during the transition period so that you don't see some of the more radical and, unfortunately, those are generally the best organized groups, seizing control, capturing the revolution and taking it into a direction that's very dark. (END VIDEO) Medal of Freedom . AZUZ: The Medal of Freedom is the highest civilian honor that's given out by the U.S. government. In a ceremony yesterday at the White House, President Obama gave out 15 of them, describing this year's recipients as ""the best of who we are and who we aspire to be."" That includes former President George H.W. Bush, America's 41st president, whose career of public service spanned 70 years. Georgia congressman and civil rights leader John Lewis, as well as German Chancellor Angela Merkel were also given Medals of Freedom. But it wasn't just politicians. Artists, like the famous poet Maya Angelou, whom the president's sister is named after, along with cellist Yo-Yo Ma and artist Jasper Johns were honored at the ceremony. Sports legends Bill Russell and Stan Musial were also among the Medal of Freedom honorees. Shoutout . TOMEKA JONES, CNN STUDENT NEWS: Time for the Shoutout! What part of the human brain is associated with memory? If you think you know it, then shout it out! Is it the: A) Cerebrum, B) Medulla, C) Thalamus or D) Brain Stem? You've got three seconds -- GO! Your memory is controlled by part of your cerebrum. That's your answer and that's your Shoutout! Man vs. Machine . AZUZ: How does our cerebrum stack up against a computer's memory banks? That is the challenge playing out on ""Jeopardy!"" this week. It's a three-day event pitting two of the show's biggest all-time winners against a super-computer named Watson. This thing was created by IBM. The company says Watson has the processing power of 2,800 powerful computers. Watson's developers say it's a major step forward in the ability of machines to understand human language. That's part of what makes this game so interesting, since a lot of Jeopardy! clues involve word play or double meanings. Host Alex Trebek described Watson's first day of performance as ""very bright, very fast, but some weird little moments once in a while."" Blog Promo . AZUZ: So, we're not in The Matrix just yet. But we want to hear your take on this man vs. machine face-off. Are you interested to see if a computer can learn language? Do you think machines could ever be as smart as people? Head to our blog at CNNStudentNews.com, let us know what you think. This Day in History . AZUZ: It's February 16th, and on this day in history in 1923, British archaeologist Howard Carter unsealed the tomb of ancient Egyptian ruler King Tut. In 1959, Fidel Castro was sworn in as the prime minister of Cuba after leading a communist revolution that overthrew Cuba's previous leader. In 1968, the first ever 9-1-1 call was made in Haleyville, Alabama. The answer on the other end of the line? ""Hello."" And in 2005, the Kyoto Protocol, a treaty aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions, went into effect. Inspiring Youth . AZUZ: Well, in more recent history -- like last week -- I interviewed former NFL running back Warrick Dunn. He's known for his accomplishments on the field during 12 seasons with the Tampa Bay Bucs and the Atlanta Falcons. But he's also known for his humanitarian work with the Warrick Dunn Family Foundation, that helps single parents achieve their dream of owning a home. In the second part of our conversation, I talked with Mr. Dunn about what advice he has for young people. Take a listen to this. (BEGIN VIDEO) AZUZ:  How does somebody who does that, who plays for the Atlanta Falcons, the Tampa Bay Bucs, how do you stay humble and positive through all that? WARRICK DUNN, FORMER NFL RUNNING BACK, PHILANTHROPIST: I've learned early in my life that treat people the same way you want to be treated. But also, I thought about my mom, her dream, her mission, how she treated people, how she wanted better for other people. I've tried to live through her, live through her lessons in life, and I wanted to be like her. AZUZ: What would you tell some of the high school students who are watching our show, who they love what they do, they love playing, but they might not have the talent or the gift to play professionally? DUNN: It's a lot that goes into it. I think, first and foremost, you have to understand ""why are you in school?"" Your focus has to be education, and I learned that early. Set yourself up, put yourself in a position to really go to the next level, and that's get a college scholarship, graduate from college, get the degree. The game, you can't play the game forever. AZUZ: What advice do you have for today's students who don't know what they want to do? DUNN: You can experience so many different things to really understand what you love or to find something that you're passionate about. That's really going out of your comfort zone and really trying new and different things. It's all about checks and balances. It's all about thinking about not, ""how am I going to live today,"" but ""how am I going to live 20, 30 years down the road."" You have to have a plan; nothing is going to come easy. You have to work for the things that you want. (END VIDEO) Before We Go . AZUZ: That man was a very good interview. And we're gonna be putting both parts of it up in the Spotlight section at CNNStudentNews.com, so keep an eye out for that. Our last story, before we go today, my very first job was bagging groceries at a supermarket. Believe that. But I don't remember it being anywhere near this intense! These folks are the best of the best. That's why they're competing in the 2011 Best Bagger National Championships. Contestants have to fill three bags with everyday items, like bread, eggs and cans. The winner, Krystal Smith from Burlington, Vermont, did it in just 38 seconds. Goodbye . AZUZ: With her superior speed and technique, that title was in the bag. But it's time for us to check out for now. We'll be back tomorrow with more commercial-free headlines.

"Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt (CNN) -- Egypt's renowned resort town of Sharm el-Sheikh  that attracts millions of tourists from around the world is growing tired of its most famous guest: Hosni Mubarak. The ousted president, say residents, is bad for business. ""We want him to leave,"" said Ahmed Fahmy, a construction worker who lives here. ""He has created a lot of problems and affected tourism. Tourism is dead now."" Added Mohamed Nasr, who runs a limousine service: ""Everbody wants"" Mubarak to leave. ""Tourism now is no good ... My business is nothing now."" Fahmy spoke across the street from Sharm el-Sheikh International Hospital, where Mubarak has been staying under heavy police protection since prosecutors began questioning him on Tuesday. The sight of helmeted riot police forming a human chain of black uniforms around the perimeter of the pyramid-shaped hospital, contrasted sharply with the palm trees, souvenir shops and sun-burned European tourists who wander past, staring curiously at them. This week, Egypt's general prosecutor officially detained Mubarak for 15 days in connection with the deaths of hundreds of activists during the street protests that toppled him from power on February 11. His two sons, Gamal and Alaa, were transferred to Cairo's Tora prison this week. Egypt's revolution succeeded in toppling a once-untouchable dictator. But it has also crippled the country's vital tourism industry, which according to some conservative estimates, accounts for 10% of the Egyptian economy. Sharm el-Sheikh, an international scuba-diving and nightclubbing mecca that normally welcomes an estimated 5 million tourists a year, has been particularly hit hard. The beaches in ""Sharm,"" as locals affectionately call it, are all but deserted. The once bustling harbor in Namma Bay is mostly quiet, except for the occasional motorboat puttering past pulling squealing tourists riding inner-tubes. Hotel operators estimated they were below 30% capacity at what is normally the peak tourist season. ""You need to be at 35% just to break even,"" said Mohamed Abbas, manager of the Iberotel Lido Hotel. In the last half of February, the hotel was at 6% to 8% capacity. Abbas estimated the current free-fall in tourism receipts is worse than decline after three deadly bombings in Egypt's Sinai in 2004, and after a series of shark attacks last November. British tourist Jane Dixon said she didn't think twice about bring her teenage son and daughter to Sharm el-Sheikh. ""Its no different from the possible threat in London,"" she said, sitting in a rooftop swimming pool with a view of the Red Sea. ""You're just as likely to get blown up riding the Tube,"" she added, referring to London's subway system. Still, the political instability gripping Cairo kept Dixon from visiting the pyramids. Her 15-year-old son, Josh, was surprised to see the cordon of riot police outside of the Sharm el-Sheikh's hospital. ""It was pretty cool,"" he said. ""I didn't know the president was staying there. There are scary guards all over the place. So I feel pretty safe."" Asked why tourists stopped coming, hotel and nightclub operator Adly El Mestekawy had one simple answer: the revolution. ""For the first time in the history of Egypt for 7,000 years a pharaoh is being investigated. His whole family is being investigated,"" Mestekawy said. But Mestekawy, who says he opened the first grocery store and hotel in Sharm el-Sheikh when it was little more than a desert campground in the 1980s, hopes Egypt's largely peaceful revolution will pay off in the long run. ""Egypt is no longer enslaved. Egypt is free and open to the world through peaceful means,"" he said. ""This will bring tourists back in large numbers and this is what the country needs."" Egypt still has a long way to go before its security forces embrace transparency. Secret police accosted a CNN camera-man as he was filming a sunset over the Red Sea on Friday. Without showing any identification, the plain-clothed officers tried to confiscate the camera before finally being convinced no state secrets had been filmed. Not far away, workers outside a souvenir shop called out an often-repeated motto to passing tourists. ""Welcome to Egypt,"" they said.","Tourism workers say Mubarak's presence has hurt business .

"Kampala, Uganda (CNN) -- The leader of Uganda's main opposition party was taken to a hospital in Kampala on Thursday after being shot in the hand, apparently by a rubber bullet allegedly fired by a member of the military police during a protest march. ""We met all of a sudden a blockade of the military police,"" Kizza Besigye told NTV Uganda after the shooting, his hand wrapped in white gauze. ""Maybe there were about 100 or so, all across the road and beside. And so I kept on walking towards them. It was when I was about 10 meters from them that they started charging onto us and firing all kinds of things. Just shortly after they started firing, I was hit."" The demonstrations in Kampala -- Besigye's hometown -- were used by opposition parties to protest the government and recent increase in commodity and fuel prices. Thursday's incident occurred as Besigye -- the leader of the Forum for Democratic Change Uganda -- was leading hundreds of Ugandans in a march to work in the suburbs of Kampala for the second time this week. ""We just ask people to walk to work two times a week, and we want to do so to show solidarity,"" he said. ""There are already tens of thousands of people who are walking to work every day because they can no longer afford the cost of public transport."" The shooting occurred when police fired tear gas and what appeared to be rubber bullets at the demonstrators -- who had surrounded Besigye in order to protect him, he said. Video from NTV showed police firing into the air and a number of people laying wounded on the ground. The British High Commission in Kampala and the U.S. Embassy condemned the arrest of Besigye that occurred during Monday's walk to work. Police released him soon after with a warning. In a statement, a spokeswoman for the Uganda Police Force said the march in Kampala violated the laws governing peaceful demonstrations. ""This has occasioned lawlessness in some areas of the city suburbs, which included blocking roads, throwing stones and general disruption of day to day activities,"" said spokeswoman Judith Nabakooba. She said that police had asked Besigye to walk alone, without being accompanied by his supporters. His insistence on including them led to a standoff that lasted for three hours, ""at which time the gathered supporters became rowdy and started throwing stones and other objectives,"" she said. ""Police officers stepped in to break up the ensuing mob action."" The report that Besigye was hurt ""in the ensuing scuffle"" is under investigation, she said. In February, Besigye lost in an election bid to replace President Yoweri Museveni, who has led the country since a rebel group with which he was aligned seized power in 1986. Besigye, a former doctor to Museveni, lost previous presidential bids in 2001 and 2006. Journalist Tom Walsh contributed to this story.","Kizza Besigye was shot in the hand, apparently by a rubber bullet .

"ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (CNN) -- The chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff arrived in Pakistan on Tuesday amid tensions between the two countries about U.S. military incursions into Pakistan's tribal areas. Adm. Michael Mullen will meet with Pakistan's new prime minister and its military chief. Adm. Michael Mullen will meet with Pakistan's newly elected prime minister, Yousaf Raza Gilani, and Pakistan's military chief, Gen. Parvez Kayani, Mullen's office said. Relations between the United States and Pakistan have been tense since the U.S. military sent ground forces into Pakistan's tribal regions earlier this month without Islamabad's permission. The incident prompted the Pakistani government to summon the U.S. ambassador to voice its disapproval, as well as deliver a ""demarche"" (a diplomatic petition or protest) through its ambassador in Washington. Last week, Kayani announced no foreign forces will be allowed to conduct operations inside Pakistan in light of the ""reckless"" U.S. military ground operation. Kayani said Pakistan's ""territorial integrity ... will be defended at all cost and no external force is allowed to conduct operations ... inside Pakistan."" His announcement came amid media reports that several months ago, President Bush authorized U.S. special forces to carry out ground assaults inside Pakistan without first seeking Islamabad's permission. Meanwhile, a suicide attack late Tuesday evening in the restive area of Swat killed three soldiers and wounded six others, the Pakistani military told CNN. Pakistan army spokesman Major Murad Khan said the driver of the suicide car bomb tried to ram the gate of a military checkpoint at a school in the Swat District. Troops shot from the check-post before the attacker reached his target, Khan said. The car exploded, and militants shot back as they ran away. The incident happened at a time when Muslims break their fasts in the month of Ramadhan. Swat militants loyal to banned religious leader Maulana Fazlullah have claimed responsibility for the attack, according to the military. The suicide attacker in the car was killed. A few others were also believed to have been killed or injured, but Khan said there were no confirmed numbers because it was dark and the militants removed the bodies of their dead and wounded. The explosion occurred at the Tutano Bandai school of Tehsil Kabal in Swat District in the North West Frontier Province. A military spokesman offer no additional details. CNN's Jamie McIntyre and Zein Basravi contributed to this report.","Adm. Michael Mullen to meet with Pakistan's new prime minister and military chief .

"(CNN) -- The Los Angeles Times and The New York Times were awarded two Pulitzer Prizes each Monday for their outstanding work in journalism. The New York Times' Clifford J. Levy and Ellen Barry won in the international reporting category for their work on the struggling Russian justice system, while the paper's David Leonhardt won for commentary. The Los Angeles Times won in the public service category for its coverage of Bell, a small California city where officials' sky-high salaries sparked national outrage and then arrests. The paper's Barbara Davidson won for feature photography. Surprisingly, given big news stories last year like the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico and the earthquake in Haiti, the prize board did not name a winner in the breaking news reporting category, a traditional favorite. Finalists in that category included the Chicago Tribune staff, for its coverage of the deaths of two Chicago firefighters, the staff at The Miami Herald and El Nuevo Herald, for their coverage of the Haiti earthquake, and the staff of The Tennessean for its coverage of a devastating flood, the board said. The Pulitzer Prizes are U.S. awards handed out once a year to recognize outstanding work in journalism and the arts. Read bios and more about this year's winners . Jennifer Egan's book, ""A Visit from the Goon Squad,"" won the award for fiction. Her book is about growing up and old in the digital age, the board said. In the music category, Zhou Long won for ""Madame White Snake,"" which was premiered by Opera Boston at the Cutler Majestic Theatre in February 2010. Paige St. John of the Sarasota Herald-Tribune in Florida won the investigative reporting award for her coverage of the state's property-insurance system.

"Ofunato, Japan (CNN) -- More than a month after the devastating tsunami and earthquake that flattened seaside communities across northern Japan, many aid groups are wrapping up operations. One team of volunteers is just ramping up, however. For those wondering what they can still do to help, the U.S.-based charity All Hands has an answer: Buy a plane ticket, and come ready to get to work. ""What we do is come in after natural disasters all around the world and help people by bringing in volunteers in the recovery process,"" said Marc Young, the charity's operational director in Ofunato, a small port city on Japan's northeastern coast. Ofunato was swamped in the tsunami that left nearly 500 dead and missing. The survivors are now faced with a mountain of debris to clear and a need to find new homes for more than 6,500 people. By Monday, the U.S.-based secular nonprofit had 23 volunteers from the United States, Canada, Britain and Australia working alongside Japanese from across the country. They were cleaning out houses and businesses and helping people salvage any personal goods and gear they could. Chris Turner, a staff project coordinator for All Hands, just arrived from working in Leogane, Haiti. Unlike Haiti, the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere, Japan is the world's third-largest economy and its government is functioning. Help is still needed, however. ""Some people, what they most like to donate is their hard work,"" says Turner, a Canadian. ""We kind of give people that opportunity."" The group is staying at a nearby house donated by a local resident and are getting a campground up and running to service the expected 100 volunteers who are streaming in every day. All Hands also is setting up a ""smart distribution"" warehouse to better allocate donated goods to the people who need them. In the immediate aftermath of the quake, truckloads of donated food, clothes and household goods were sent in. Now there are huge pallets of toilet paper, plates and other scattered goods from people who were well-meaning, but unclear on what was needed. ""We think that there is enough shampoo and detergent here for every person in every shelter to use a bottle a day for a year,"" Young said. There are few baths or working washing machines in the area, and what people really need is fresh food, he said. Most people have temporary shelter, and All Hands is forming a partnership with Habitat for Humanity to build 50 new homes. The group also is working with local leaders to team volunteers with Japanese carpenters to pull out waterlogged floors and walls from homes that are otherwise structurally sound. ""It's rewarding to get all the debris out of the homes,"" Young said. ""But it's especially exciting to take the next step and get people back in to their own homes."" The group members are from all over the world, but All Hands says they had to pick the first volunteers from among thousands of offers based on skills they could contribute. Amya Miller, a volunteer from Boston, was born and raised in Japan, and now works as an interpreter. Miller said she her family and business on hold for two months to come and help in Japan and called in every favor she was ever owed to raise money. ""You can't forget about these people,"" she said. ""This is a multi-year recovery process.""","All Hands cleans houses and helps families salvage posessions .

The caption that ran with the photo says ""Now you know why no birth certificate,"" the affiliate reported. Davenport said she would not repeat her error in the apology that included two Bible passages. ""I am an imperfect Christian lady who tries her best to live a Christ-like honoring life,"" the statement said. ""I would never do anything to intentionally harm or berate others regardless of ethnicity. So I ask for your forgiveness, for I am truly sorry."" Despite criticism, Davenport told the affiliate that she does not need to resign her position because of the e-mail. Scott Baugh, chairman of the Republican Party of Orange County, said he was surprised by the e-mail. ""There's no question the e-mail is racist. The only question is what was in Marilyn's heart, what was her intent. But I don't think there's anybody on her committee or anybody in the world really that doesn't see it as a racist,"" Baugh said on CNN's ""AC360."" Baugh said he feels Davenport should resign. ""The bottom line is being sorry for something and having a sincere apology doesn't undo the action, it doesn't stop the consequences,"" Baugh said. ""There's still consequences for what she's done and what she's done will continue to bring controversy to my party so I'm inclined to think at this time that she should still resign from the committee.""

"(CNN) -- Portuguese champions Porto are through to the semfinals of the Europa League after a thumping 5-2 win at Spartak Moscow gave them a 10-3 aggregate victory . Porto went into the match in control of the tie following their 5-1 win in Portugal, and added to that lead when Hulk burst through to score a 28tth-minute opener. Cristian Rodriguez doubled their advantage with a near post header on the stroke of half-time and Fredy Guarin converted Falcao's pull back early in the second half for the third goal. Is Villas Boas the new 'Special One'? Artem Dzyuba gave the home side some pride by pulling a goal back in the 52nd minute but Porto soon regained their three-goal cushion when Falcao headed home. Ari pulled another back for the hosts but Ruben Micael rifled home a late fifth as Porto achieved the highest-ever quarterfinal winning margin in the history of the competition. In what proved to be a famous night for Portuguese football, Porto were joined in the last four by compatriots Benfica and Braga, who will now face each other ensuring a Portuguese representative in next month's final in Dublin. Braga secured their place thanks to a 0-0 home draw with Dynamo Kiev, putting them through on the away goals rule after a 1-1 first leg draw in Ukraine. And they secured qualification the hard way, playing for over an hour with just 10 men after the dismissal of Paolo Cesar for a late tackle in the 29th minute. Meanwhile, Benfica secured their place after a 2-2 draw at Dutch side PSV Eindhoven gave them a 6-3 aggregate success. PSV threatened to create a shock following their 4-1 defeat in Lisbon, racing into an early 2-0 lead on the night. But goals from Luisao and an Oscar Cardazo penalty ensured Benfica now face their compatriots Braga. Meanwhile, Porto face Villarreal in the other semi, after the Spanish side eased past Dutch champions FC Twente. Already 5-1 up from the first leg in Spain, Villarreal completed the job with a 3-1 victory in the Netherlands for an 8-2 aggregate win. Twente gave themselves a glimmer of hope with Emir Bajrami's 32nd minute tap in but the visitors levelled on the hour when Giuseppe Rossi scored from the spot after Twente's Dwight Tiadealli was sent off for fouling Wakaso Mubarak. Marco Ruben added a second penalty on 84 minutes and Cani completed the scoring with a superb left-foot volley late on.","Portugal have three teams through to the semifinals of the Europa League .

"(CNN) -- The 8.9-magnitude earthquake and coastline-devouring tsunami that hit Japan has led 49 countries, the European Union and even the International Atomic Energy Agency to band together and offer relief to the devastated island nation. With Japan's death toll at 686 people, the international relief effort has been spurred by the stark, globally televised videos of homes and offices rattled to near collapse and entire waterfront communities being washed away by a rising ocean. The international community's assistance complemented the United States' expansive relief mission, which includes supplies, several warships, search-and-rescue teams, radiation-contamination specialists, and two officials from the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission with expertise in boiling water nuclear reactors. On Sunday, the nuclear-powered aircraft carrier USS Ronald Reagan arrived off the coast of Honshu to support Japanese forces in disaster relief operations, the U.S. Department of Defense said in a statement. Also Sunday, the Chinese government sent a 15-member team to assist in the search for survivors, Xinhua News Agency reported. The team brought with them four tons of equipment and material for the search as well to provide power and telecommunications to areas that have temporarily lost those services because of the quake. In addressing one of the bigger potential threats, the international atomic agency's Incident and Emergency Centre has offered technical assistance to Japan in the wake of an explosion at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant. An evacuation order for a 20-kilometer (12.4-mile) radius around the plant is affecting tens of thousands of people. On Saturday, the United Kingdom said it was sending a team of 59 fire service search-and-rescue specialists, two rescue dogs and a medical support team, according to the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. With a scheduled arrival on Sunday, the crew will immediately join the international search for survivors in shattered and inundated communities, the British office said. The teams will take up to 11 tonnes of rescue equipment, including heavy lifting and cutting equipment to extract people trapped in debris, the government said. The UK foreign office also dispatched a 10-member consular response team, including British Red Cross workers, to Japan on Saturday morning, the government said. South Korea is sending two rescue dogs, two handlers and three assistants to carry out what are expected to be dramatic searches of people inside collapsed structures. The rescue teams were scheduled to arrive Saturday, Japan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a written statement. In China, Premier Wen Jiabao, who expressed ""deep sympathy"" to the Japanese government and people, made a formal offer of assistance. Members of the country's international rescue team were ready to depart for Japan if needed, Chen Jianmin, director of the China Earthquake Administration, told the government's Xinhua News Agency. The United States is providing as many 11 warships, with their helicopters, to assist Japanese authorities in rescue and recovery missions. The U.S. Agency for International Development was dispatching two urban search-and-rescue teams, one from Fairfax County, Virginia, and the second from Los Angeles County -- totaling 150 people and 12 canines trained to find survivors. They are scheduled to arrive Monday morning in Japan. On Saturday, the Japanese foreign ministry listed the 49 countries extending offers of relief, in no particular order: Australia, Taiwan, the United States, South Korea, China, Mexico, Thailand, New Zealand, Israel, Singapore, Indonesia, Azerbaijan, India, Russia, Turkey, Germany, France, Belgium, Ukraine, Slovakia, United Arab Emirates, Switzerland, Hungary, Poland, Jordan, the United Kingdom, Chile, Spain, Greece, Hong Kong, Pakistan, Denmark, Serbia, Uruguay, Mongolia, Ecuador, Iran, Kyrgyz Republic, Malaysia, Argentine, Philippines, Canada, Italy, Sweden, Kosovo, Iceland, Norway, Romania, and Slovenia.","NEW: China sends 15-member team and four tons of equipment .

"(CNN) -- Ailing German champions Bayern Munich thrashed second-placed Bayer Leverkusen 5-1 on Sunday to boost the club's hopes of European Champions League football next season. Germany international striker Mario Gomez scored a first-half hat-trick for the 22-time Bundesliga winners in a victory which saw the Bavarians climb into the third and final qualifying position for Europe's premier club competition. The 25-year-old scored his treble between an early Simon Rolfes own-goal and a late strike from French winger Franck Ribery, with Switzerland striker Eren Derdiyok restoring some pride for Jupp Heynckes' team. Leverkusen, four-times German runners-up but not since 2002 when the club also lost in the Champions League final, could have closed to within two points of league leaders Borussia Dortmund. But Dortmund instead moved eight points clear with a 3-0 victory over Freiburg in Sunday's late match. Heynckes, who has coached Bayern on two previous occasions, is set to move to the Allianz Arena next season as a replacement for sacked Dutch coach Louis van Gaal. Van Gaal guided Bayern to a domestic league and cup double last season, also losing in the Champions League final, but the 59-year-old lost his job after last weekend's draw with Nuremberg. Bayern, currently under caretaker boss Andries Jonker, are now one point ahead of fourth-placed Hannover -- who drew 0-0 at Hamburg on Saturday -- with four games left. The opening goal against Leverkusen arrived after just seven minutes when Bastian Schweinsteiger headed a Thomas Muller corner onto the unfortunate Rolfes, who deflected the ball beyond goalkeeper Rene Adler. Gomez grabbed a second in the 28th minute when Chile's Arturo Vidal made a mistake with a backpass, before 2010 World Cup golden boot winner Muller grabbed his second assist of the match as he teed up his teammate at the far post a minute before halftime. Gomez claimed the match ball with his 22nd Bundesliga goal this season in first-half stoppage time, before Derdiyok found the roof of the net for the visitors just past the hour mark. A neat move between Ribery and Belgium defender Daniel van Buyten led to Bayern's fifth and final goal with 15 minutes remaining. Borussia Dortmund, seeking a first title since the club's sixth success in 2001-02, had few problems at home to eighth-placed Freiburg. Defender Marcel Schmelzer burst to the byline and cut the ball back for 18-year-old Mario Gotze to open the scoring in the 23rd minute, then Dortmund playmaker Nuri Sahin limped off with a knee injury. Striker Robert Lewandowski made up for two earlier misses with the second goal just before halftime, with the Poland international pouncing after Freiburg's Omer Toprak deflected a pass from defender Mats Hummels into his path. Kevin Grosskreutz sealed victory in the 78th minute with his 15th goal in all competitions this season after Lewandowski released Gotze and the teenager squared the ball to the 22-year-old.","Bayern Munich beat title hopefuls Leverkusen 5-1 to move into third in the Bundesliga .

"(CNN)  -- World number three Roger Federer exited the Monte Carlo Masters at the quarterfinals stage to Austrian Jurgen Melzer Friday. Melzer was securing his first victory over the 16-time grand slam champion as he ran out a 6-4 6-4 winner at the prestigious clay court event. It was the earliest defeat for Federer in a tournament this year, ending his hopes of claiming the Monte Carlo title for the first time after being beaten three times in the final by Rafael Nadal. He has drawn blank since claiming the ATP season-opener in Doha, Qatar. Federer had breezed to the last eight, but was always struggling against Melzer in blustery conditions. Melzer broke for 3-2 in the opening set after an errant Federer forehand and held on to close it out. Blog: Can Sharapova return to the top? The second followed a similar pattern, with Federer unable to capitalize on his seven break points in the match as the seventh seed went through. Melzer was delighted to finally get past his old nemesis in such convincing fashion. ""He beat me three times last year and I didn't even win a set,"" he told AFP. ""But many things went well for me, my shots worked well. When he had break points I was calm and served well. ""I did well on the big points and played my game."" Federer shrugged off his defeat as he now takes a two-week break before the Madrid Masters in his build-up to the French Open next month. ""I don't think I played terrible, it was OK. Obviously, it was still the first week of clay, so I don't expect myself to play my very best. If I had, it would be a pleasant surprise,"" said the second seed. Melzer will now play world number six David Ferrer after the Spaniard saw off 11th Viktor Troicki of Serbia 6-3 6-3 in an earlier match Friday. There was no stopping world number one Rafael Nadal, bidding for his seventh straight title in Monte Carlo, as he swept aside Croatian Ivan Ljubicic 6-1 6-3 to reach the last four. Nadal will face off against Britain's Andy Murray for a place in Sunday's final after the number three seed continued his fine run with a 6-1 6-2 dismissal of Portuguse qualifier Frederico Gil in just over an hour.","Roger Federer beaten in quarterfinals of Monte Carlo Masters by Jurgen Melzer .

"(CNN) -- Heavy rains that began early in January in northern central Namibia have reached staggering proportions, with 80 people drowned and half a million others affected directly or indirectly, officials said. President Hifikepunye Pohamba declared a national emergency in all six northern regions on March 28. The affected region is in the Cuvelai Basin, which drains southern Angola via a complex of streams that typically result in an annual flood called the efundja, which is named for the fish that spawn in spring. This year's efundja has resulted in the wettest year since systematic measurements started in 1891, with rainfall in affected areas nearly double the normal average. Government figures cite 263 school closures, with a total of 320 affected, leaving 114,000 schoolchildren shut out of their classrooms. Up to 40 health clinics are under water, and more than 100 health mobile outreach points have been made inaccessible as a result of damage to roads and bridges, according to the World Health Organization. In addition, roads, bridges, homes and staple crops in all six northern and northeastern regions in Namibia have been destroyed, according to UNICEF. They represent some of the country's poorest areas. The Red Cross Society of Namibia estimates that 500,000 people have been affected, with the densely populated central-northern regions -- Omusati, Oshona and Ohangwena -- hit worst. But other areas are also threatened, as rivers -- including the Zambezi -- drain southern and central Angola. Forecasters predict areas like Caprivi, which is about 500 kilometers (310 miles) east, may experience more flooding by next week. About 40,000 people have been displaced, some 10,000 of whom have been accommodated in 68 camps set up by the government, officials said. The death toll is expected to rise as water-borne diseases, mainly malaria, are predicted to spread. The Red Cross and the U.N.'s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs are appealing for help, and the U.S. government and some European countries have made donations. OCHA said in its southern Africa flood and cyclone report, published Wednesday, that 2011 marks the third consecutive year of heavy rains in the region. The result is that the water table has risen and that ""flood water levels are unlikely to recede for the next three to six months."" More rain is expected. Journalist John Grobler contributed to this report.","80 people reported drowned; death toll expected to rise as diseases spread .

WARRICK DUNN, FORMER NFL RUNNING BACK: What's up! I'm Warrick Dunn, and this is CNN Student News. Check it out! First Up: Egypt in Crisis . AZUZ: Scenes of celebration turn to shouts of anger as the crisis in Egypt takes a new turn. This political unrest in the North African nation started late last month. Thousands of protesters marching in the streets, calling for a change in leadership. Their main target: long-time President Hosni Mubarak. These protesters want him out of office now. Yesterday, a huge crowd showed up in the downtown square where a lot of these protests have been going on. The people there were cheering, getting ready for a speech that President Mubarak was scheduled to make, and the rumors were that he was going to step down. During his speech, Mubarak said that he will keep his promise to leave office in the fall after new elections. He said that he's delegating power to the vice president. And he said that he will respond to protesters' demands. What he did not say was that he would immediately leave office. The response from the crowd in the square was immediate, and it was angry. Crowds began chanting ""get out"" as the president spoke. This is a dynamic situation; things are changing; they're developing all the time. We want you to go to CNN.com for the latest updates. Is This Legit? TOMEKA JONES, CNN STUDENT NEWS: Is this legit? The next U.S. presidential election takes place on November 6, 2011. Not true! It's exactly one year after that, on November 6, 2012. 2012 Contenders . AZUZ: The election might be 21 months away, but the lines are forming for people who may want to get into the race. And a convention happening right now in Washington, D.C. may offer some ideas about who will be on the ballot. It's CPAC, the Conservative Political Action Conference. Thousands of conservatives from across the country are spending three days in the nation's capital. They'll hear speeches from some big names in the Republican party, and they'll take part in a straw poll. It's an unofficial vote, and this one includes 15 candidates. Some analysts use these polls to make predictions about who might end up running for president. Ed Henry is CNN's senior White House correspondent; no stranger to the presidential campaign trail. He's here to help explain some of the pros and cons of running for the country's highest political office. (BEGIN VIDEO) ED HENRY, CNN SR. WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: When we take a close look at the contenders for 2012, we obviously need to include the sitting president of the United States. But while incumbency has its privileges, it also clearly brings some challenges as well. Call it the power of the presidency. Especially that 416-ton, taxpayer-financed jet that helps you rally voters, rake in millions, and grab headlines from coast to coast. JACK QUINN, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST: When he goes into local markets -- you've been all over with him -- he sucks all the oxygen out of the air. HENRY: Allowing President Obama to road-test a potential 2012 campaign slogan popping up on new t-shirts that say ""we do big things."" BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We can do what this moment demands and focus on what's necessary for America to win the future. HENRY: But incumbency also has a downside. ED GILLESPIE, FORMER RNC CHAIRMAN: They do bad things, and the policies that they've imposed have not helped us get unemployment down to where it ought to be. HENRY: The candidate of hope and change in 2008 was largely a blank slate. Now, he has to defend a controversial record, which is why he tried to hit the reset button and focus on jobs in his State of the Union. But the crisis in Egypt is a reminder: sometimes incumbents set the agenda, other times it gets set for them. So far, there's no sign of a serious primary challenge to the president. And he may also be helped by the Republicans' muddled field so far. But Ed Gillespie argues that tough competition could help the GOP, just like the Democratic primary of 2008. HILLARY CLINTON, SECRETARY OF STATE: Shame on you, Barack Obama! HENRY: While the pundits warned that the long drama of Clinton v. Obama would hurt the party, just the opposite happened. GILLESPIE: It made Obama better when he emerged as the nominee. He was a stronger nominee for it. HENRY: By 2012, the president will have had four years of hand-to-hand combat, this time with Republicans. The big question now is whether those battles have, once again, made him a stronger nominee.

President Abraham Lincoln, or Honest Abe, is also known as the Great Emancipator. That's your answer and that's your Shoutout! Lincoln's Birthday . AZUZ: Lincoln got that nickname because he's credited with freeing, or emancipating, the country's slaves through his Emancipation Proclamation in 1863. President Lincoln also pushed for the passage of the 13th Amendment, which outlawed slavery in the United States. That was one of his big campaign issues when he ran for re-election in 1864. And Honest Abe has a birthday coming up. This Saturday, February 12th, marks the 202nd anniversary of the birth of the 16th president. The fact that Lincoln, the Great Emancipator, was born in February is part of the reason why February was picked as Black History Month. Black History Month Quiz . AZUZ: And our commemoration of Black History Month continues today. For this quick quiz, we're focusing on African-American inventors. First question for you: Ironing out wrinkles is a lot easier thanks to the ironing board. Who created it? Was it George Washington Carver, Sarah Boone or Garrett Morgan? Anwer is: On April 26, 1892, Sarah Boone received a patent for an ironing board made of a narrow wooden board, collapsible legs and a padded cover. Next up, something you're probably familiar with: the pencil sharpener. Who came up with this invention? Your choices here: Charles Brooks, Lonnie Johnson or John Love? Here we go: It was John Love, patented his design for the pencil sharpener in 1897. Last question, and this one's gonna be tough. Any of you who use a hair brush with synthetic bristles, who do you have to thank for it? Was it Madam C.J. Walker, Lyda Newman or Marie Brown? Our last answer: Lyda Newman didn't invent the hair brush, but she was the first person to make one with synthetic bristles.

"(CNN) -- Faced with some of driest conditions Texas has seen in nearly a century, firefighters around the state are struggling to fight off what a forest service official on Sunday called the ""perfect storm for wildfires."" April Saginor, a spokeswoman with the Texas Forest Service, said crews were having difficulty getting hundreds of blazes under control due to a rare combination of strong winds, unseasonably warm temperatures and low humidity. Conditions this spring are the driest they've been in Texas since 1917, she claimed. Authorities have responded to 7,807 fires across more than 1.5 million acres since this year's wildfire season began, Gov. Rick Perry wrote in a letter late Saturday to President Barack Obama requesting that the federal government declare Texas a disaster area. These have affected all but two of the state's 254 counties. On Sunday, some 1,300 personnel representing 34 states were on the front lines battling these fires. And, unless there is a drastic and sustained change in conditions, Saginor said she expects the fight to continue for several months more. ""We're looking at this as a marathon, not a sprint,"" she said. ""We're very committed to this."" To that end, Perry's request to federal authorities -- which he made late Saturday and announced Sunday -- was an attempt to expedite federal assistance. ""I have determined that this incident is of such severity and magnitude that effective response is beyond the capabilities of the state and the affected local governments, and that supplementary federal assistance is necessary,"" the governor wrote in his letter to Obama, sent through a Texas-based Federal Emergency Management Agency official. Saginor noted that rural areas and more populated areas like Austin have been affected -- though she added that there have been no civilian casualties and problems with numerous evacuations that have taken place. The governor noted that one firefighter has died and 18 others have been injured, while 244 homes have been destroyed and another 8,514 threatened residences ""saved."" ""The wildland fire risk potential has reached a critically high level,"" Perry said. These conditions ""present a serious hazard to the lives and property of the citizens of the state."" New and evolving wildfires prompted three sets of evacuations Sunday, all while crews tried to prevent further damage all around the state. The Texas Forest Service announced in a statement that, as of 2:15 p.m. Sunday, people were being ordered to evacuate from Strawn and other parts of Palo Pinto County and Caddo in Stephens County. Strawn's population of 764, the forest agency said, is endangered by a fire fanned by strong winds and fueled by ""extremely dry"" conditions in north central Texas. People in other parts of Palo Pinto County, including those in about 300 homes and a campground in the Peninsula on Possum Kingdom Lake, have also been told to leave. Saginor explained that these actions are part of a trio of nearby fires that, collectively, have burned 55,000 acres. Numerous resources -- including three helitankers (helicopters that dump water), two Blackhawk helicopters and three 20-man crews -- have been brought in, she said. A 2,200-acre fire imperiled Caddo, where 40 people lived in 2000, according to the Texas State Historical Society. Two hours later, the forest service noted that evacuations were ""in progress"" in Travis County, home of the state capital of Austin. That fire, while smaller than many others at 60 acres, raised alarms as it crept near 100 homes, 10 businesses and Austin Community College. The forest service update, posted online at 4:19 p.m. Sunday, said ""extreme fire behavior is being exhibited,"" though no additional information was immediately available. Mother Nature didn't appear to be doing firefighters any favors. Sustained winds in many locales were blowing 20 to 25 mph from the south this weekend, and gusting even stronger. And the long-term forecast didn't look much better. The forecast in Palo Pinto County for instance, called for high temperatures in the mid-90s through Tuesday, according to the National Weather Service. In Austin, temperatures are expected to hit or surpass 90 all week. ""With the winds that we've got today, it's hard to be aggressive with any suppression activities; it's just too dangerous to get in front of that type of fire,"" Texas Forest Service spokesman Marq Webb told CNN affiliate WFAA. ""The fires we're experiencing in some cases are moving four or five miles an hour. That's the length of a football field every minute."" As of Saturday, Texas Forest Service personnel were responding to at least 14,758 acres of new fires -- five of them major -- that broke out during the day. A blend of potent winds, dense growth of flammable material and low humidity have made this a challenging season for firefighters in the state, with 195 Texas counties banning any burning in a bid to prevent more blazes. The biggest of the new fires Saturday was in Jack County, where more than 150 homes were threatened and ultimately saved in the town of Bryson, according to the forest service. That 7,500-acre fire was 40% contained as of 11 a.m. Sunday. A 1,440-acre fire in Trinity County burning in mostly pine forest 20 miles northwest of Livingston and 800 acres that imperiled 40 homes in Tyler County some 10 miles northeast of Kountze were both 50% contained. Two Blackhawk helicopters, from the National Guard, were called in to assist with the latter blaze, the Texas Forest Service said. Some 1,850 acres in Cisco were threatened by a new 1,400-acre fire in Eastland County that was 75% contained, and forces had batted down an even higher percentage of the 2,000-acre blaze burning in Young County, six miles northeast of Graham. All these blazes paled in size to several others elsewhere in Texas. The biggest this season has been the so-called Rockhouse fire that spanned more than 182,000 acres in Presidio and Jeff Davis counties. That blaze, which destroyed 23 homes and two businesses, is 70% contained. In Coke County, north of San Angelo, crews had only managed to contain 10% of 130,000 acres of what's being called the Wildcat fire. The Texas Forest Service said late Sunday afternoon that this blaze was moving north and northwest, making it a threat to the county seat of Robert Lee and its 1,171 residents. New resources were brought in this weekend to fight this fire, with the state agency saying crews planned to approach it from the south. Another major wildfire centered in Cooper Mountain Ranch -- spanning 152,000 acres in Kent, Stonewall and Fisher counties -- was half-contained as of Sunday morning, with shifting winds the previous day pushing the flames toward Camp Springs. CNN's Stephanie Gallman contributed to this report.","NEW: A forest service spokeswoman says conditions are the driest since 1917 .

"Kaduna, Nigeria (CNN) -- Nigerians voted for president Saturday, a week after parliamentary elections were marred by violence and accusations of fraud in Africa's most populous nation. Incumbent Goodluck Jonathan is the presidential front-runner despite a poor performance in the parliamentary and senate elections by his People's Democratic Party. The former vice president assumed office after President Umaru Yar'Adua died last year following treatment for a kidney ailment in Saudi Arabia. Jonathan has led the nation of about 150 million people since May. About 73 million people are registered to vote. His main challenger -- former military ruler Muhammadu Buhari -- was a contestant in the past elections in 2003 and 2007. Buhari is the candidate for the Congress for Progressive Change. Other candidates include Nuhu Ribadu and current Kano state Gov. Ibrahim Shekarau. A CNN iReporter in Lagos, who gave her name as Jan Young, said she expected the race to be tight. ""If the incumbent president wins, it won't be a landslide victory but a fair split between the ruling and opposition parties who campaigned for our votes. I also expect our nation would demand accountability from whoever wins at the end of the day,"" she wrote. The winner will face tough challenges in the former British colony that has been mostly under military rule in its 50 years of independence. For starters, to avoid a runoff, the winner must get at least a quarter of the vote in two-thirds of the 36 states and the capital. The ruling party has a tradition of alternating power between the mostly Muslim north and the Christian and animist south after two terms in office. The rhythm was broken when Jonathan, a southerner, succeeded Yar'Adua during his second term in office. Some ruling party leaders have demanded a candidate from the north. Saturday's voting was largely peaceful, except for a bomb that exploded in northeastern Nigeria early in the day. The blast was in Maiduguri city in Borno state, according to a spokesman for the National Emergency Management Agency. Gunfire also rang out in that city, the spokesman said, but there were no immediate reports of casualties. The relative calm stood in contrast to the violence that marred the country's parliamentary elections last week. During that vote, separate bomb blasts ripped through a polling station and a collation center in northeastern Nigeria. Human Rights Watch has estimated that at least 85 people have been killed in political violence so far. A new election chief promised free and fair elections, but the electoral commission was forced to put off elections earlier this year by a week after logistical problems, including party logos missing from ballot papers, were reported nationwide. It was a major setback reminiscent of the nation's 2007 elections, which the European Union described as filled with rampant vote rigging, violence, theft of ballot boxes and intimidation. Nigeria, Africa's most populous country and its largest oil producer, is a major supplier of crude oil to the United States, and hosts many Western oil companies and workers. Nigerians voted April 9 for 360 House of Representatives seats and 109 Senate seats.  After the presidential election on Saturday, a gubernatorial vote will be held on April 26. Nigerians are working to harness the power of the internet this year to demand accountability and encourage citizens to get involved in the voting process. The west African nation has 43 million internet users -- the largest in Africa -- and they are increasingly using Twitter, Facebook and blogs to report cases of voting problems during the election season.","The voting was largely peaceful .

"(CNN) -- Two mothers expressed outrage Friday night that their young children -- about 1,000 miles away and days apart -- were inadvertently given alcohol by servers at franchises of national chain restaurants. Jill Vanheest, whose 2-year-old son was given sangria on March 31 at an Olive Garden in Lakeland, Florida, told HLN's Jane Velez-Mitchell that she's having difficulty accepting what happened. ""They poisoned my child right in front of me,"" Vanheest said Friday. ""There aren't really words for how distrustful that makes me feel, how angry I am."" Just over a week later, on April 8, Taylor Dill-Reese said that her 15-month-old son was given alcohol during a meal -- rather than the apple juice he'd ordered -- at an Applebee's in Madison Heights, Michigan. She said that the staff there explained that the boy got the wrong drink due to a mix-up at the bar, after containers for apple juice and margarita mix (which has tequila and triple sec) were somehow switched. This week, Applebee's issued a statement apologizing to the parents of Dominic Wilson Jr. ""for the stress and worry this caused them."" It vowed to immediately retrain servers on the company's ""beverage pouring policy"" and change to pouring apple juice only from single-serve containers, like a juice box. ""We recognize our responsibility to constantly assess our safety policies and procedures to ensure they are rigorous and consistently followed,"" the Kansas-based chain said. ""We believe today's strong actions make a statement to our guests of all ages around our commitment to provide a safe and enjoyable dining experience."" But Dill-Reese told Velez-Mitchell on Friday that she's not convinced. The mother, who is 18 and was at the restaurant with her son and fiance, said she was particularly angry given that a similar incident happened before at Applebee's -- namely, a 2006 case in which a 5-year-old boy was given a Long Island iced tea, which contains rum, gin, vodka and tequila, at a New York City establishment of the national chain. ""it's just sad, the simple fact that this isn't the first time this happened (or) that they were going to change the way they were going to serve drinks,"" the mother said. ""Why wait two, three kids later to change the way you serve drinks? What if my son was the one that died?"" Steven Krawitz, a personal injury attorney who represented the family involved in the 2006 case, told HLN that -- whatever Applebee's and other restaurant's promises to change their policies for serving drinks to children -- a parent should never rely on a server fully when their son or daughter gets a beverage. ""The parent, unfortunately, cannot now trust what used to be a no-brainer,"" Krawitz said. ""Restaurants are serving drinks for kids, millions of drinks, but now, given this sort of rash of ... unavoidable or unacceptable mistakes, the parents now have to test the drink."" Police were called to the Applebee's in Michigan after Dill-Reese and her fiance noticed Dominic acting strangely -- ""saying 'hi' and 'bye' to the walls (and) laid his head down like he was sleepy, then woke up and got really hyper,"" recalled the mother. Once a server told the parents that the boy was given margarita mix, he was rushed to the hospital, where Dill-Reese said he had a blood-alcohol limit of .10. Applebee's, though, said that Madison Heights police conducted a field test and found the drink itself only registered a .014 alcohol level. While Dill-Reese has already filed a lawsuit against Applebee's, Vanheest said she has not decided whether to do the same against Olive Garden. Vanheest claims that her son, Nikolai, ordered an orange juice and started drinking it. But then a waiter ""came over and said there's been a mistake, grabbed the cup and kind of scurried away."" Meanwhile, her son ""was not acting like himself"" -- climbing in and out of his high chair and people's laps, not responding to requests to calm down, and ""just getting louder and louder."" When the restaurant's staff admitted that the boy had gotten sangria, which contains wine, the child was brought to the hospital. After some struggle, he was given intravenous fluids and had his blood drawn before being checked and eventually released. ""He ended up with a lot of bruises,"" Vanheest said. After the incident came to light, Olive Garden released a statement in which it called the incident ""unacceptable."" The chain, which is headquartered in Orlando, Florida, said ""we have implemented a change in our procedures to prevent this situation from happening again"" -- though it didn't detail what those changes were. ""We take the responsibility that comes with serving alcohol seriously,"" the statement said. ""As much as we strive for perfection, this was an unfortunate case of human error."" But Vanheest, the toddler's mother, said she's not yet ready to forgive. ""Just that their disorganization allowed this ever to happen -- it's extremely frustrating,"" she said. ""I've lost all trust and all faith in them."" Watch ISSUES with Jane Velez-Mitchell Monday through Sunday at 7pm ET on HLN.

"(CNN) -- World No. 1 Rafael Nadal will face compatriot David Ferrer in Sunday's final as he seeks a remarkable seventh successive title at the Monte Carlo Masters clay-court event. The Spaniard had to battle for almost three hours before overcoming third seed Andy Murray, whose hopes of a first win on the surface against Nadal were ultimately hampered by an elbow injury. Nadal finally triumphed 6-4 2-6 6-1 to set up a clash with Ferrer, who reached his first final in the principality with a 6-3 6-2 win over Roger Federer's conqueror Jurgen Melzer in Saturday's opening semifinal. Murray's participation was in doubt before the first serve as he needed a pre-match injection, and he required lengthy treatment in the deciding set at 3-0 down -- having been denied it after the previous game due to tournament rules. He told reporters that he will have a scan on Sunday to determine the extent of the injury. Can Murray become a grand slam champion? The British player has restored his confidence in this tournament, coming into it on a four-match losing streak after early exits in Miami, Indian Wells and Rotterdam following his Australian Open final defeat by Novak Djokovic. The world No. 4 had lost both previous clay clashes with Nadal and was seeking to redress a 4-9 career record against a player whose only defeat in Monte Carlo came in his first appearance in 2003. ""It's good to know you're able to play at a similar level to what he does on the clay. To win against him, you need to be able to do that for three and a half hours, four hours. He's the best player in the world for a reason,"" Murray said. ""It's good to be close to him, but I want to try to play better than that. I'll need to, if I want to beat him, because he's going to improve the next few weeks the more he plays on clay."" Nadal, the first man to win an ATP Tour event six times in a row, is seeking to extend his record of Masters Series titles to 19 following hard-court final defeats in Miami and Indian Wells by Djokovic -- who missed this tournament due to injury. He bounced back after dropping an early service game and won four in a row before Murray leveled at 4-4. Nadal held to take the lead and then broke Murray as the 23-year-old conceded the set with a backhand error. The Scot bounced back well, hitting 13 winners to Nadal's three as he won the second set, but he could not maintain that momentum in the decider. It was only the sixth time Nadal had lost a set in 39 matches at the tournament. Fourth seed Ferrer lost to Nadal in the semifinals last year before being beaten again by him in the final of the Rome Masters. The 29-year-old, a semifinalist in Melbourne in January, reached his third final of 2010 having won on clay in Mexico's Acapulco and on hard-court at Auckland, New Zealand. Ninth-ranked Melzer was playing in his first Masters Series semifinal, having become the first Austrian to reach the last-four stage in Monte Carlo since clay-court legend Thomas Muster 15 years ago. Is Sharapova back as a real contender? Meanwhile, women's Fed Cup champions Italy face an uphill battle to reach this year's final after losing both rubbers on the opening day of the semi against Russia in Moscow. World No. 3 Vera Zvonareva thrashed Sara Errani 6-0 6-2 in Saturday's first singles match, then two-time grand slam champion Svetlana Kuznetsova battled past Roberta Vinci 6-2 6-7 (4-7) 6-1. Zvonareva, making her first appearance in the teams competition since helping Russia to a fourth title in 2008, can clinch victory in the best-of-five tie by beating Vinci in Sunday's opening reverse singles tie. Italy have won it the past two years, but went into this match without top-ranked players Francesca Schiavone and Flavia Pennetta. The other semifinal between Belgium and the Czech Republic was level at 1-1 in Charleroi. The home team were without injured world No. 2 Kim Clijsters, and her replacement -- the 106th-ranked Kirsten Flipkens -- lost 6-2 7-6 (7-4) to No. 18 Petra Kvitova in the opening match. The Belgians, beaten by Italy in the 2006 final and winners for the first time in 2001, drew level when world No. 23 Yanina Wickmayer triumphed 6-4 6-4 against Barbora Zahlavova-Strycova.","Rafael Nadal through to seventh consecutive Monte Carlo title match .

"Washington (CNN) -- A plane carrying Michelle Obama had to abort its landing on Monday after it came too close to a military C-17 cargo plane ahead of it, according to a senior administration official and the Federal Aviation Administration. The planes -- which were both trying to land -- were three miles apart, when they are supposed to be five miles apart, the official told CNN. The Federal Aviation Administration is investigating what went wrong, as it is believed to be an air traffic controller mistake, the official said. The White House does not believe the first lady's life was ever in danger, the senior official said. The FAA said in a statement controllers at Andrews Air Force Base instructed an incoming Boeing 737 to perform a ""go around"" ""because the plane did not have the required amount of separation"" behind the military plane. Air traffic controller caught watching movie on duty . The FAA is investigating. ""The aircraft were never in any danger,"" the agency said. The landing was briefly aborted and Obama's plane had to circle, the official said. Obama was actually on a C-40, a military version of the 737 that was part of the Air National Guard -- not the regular Air Force fleet used by VIPs at Andrews, said Maj. Michelle Lai of the 89th Airlift Wing at Andrews Air Force Base. What it's like to be an air traffic controller . The FAA did not want Obama's plane to be caught in the ""jet wash,"" of the C-17 as it landed, Lai said. That refers to the force of the air from the back of the C-17. ""It's important to know the FAA made the right call and at no time was the first lady's life in danger,"" Lai said. When the Potomac TRACON, the regional radar facility, handed off the plane to the Andrews Air Force Base tower, the planes were three miles apart, a government official told CNN. ""Both facilities knew how far apart they were"" at the time of the handoff, the official said. But the official declined to say why the hand-off occurred. Plane clipped by tractor-trailer at Boston airport . The TRACON could have slowed Obama's plane down or order it to turn earlier, the official said. Why that wasn't done is under investigation. But ""it was a controlled situation,"" the government official said.

"(CNN) -- A California Republican official on Wednesday apologized once again for sending an e-mail depicting President Barack Obama as a chimpanzee, but insisted she was not motivated by racism. ""To my fellow Americans and everyone else who saw that e-mail and was offended,  I humbly apologize and ask for your forgiveness for my unwise behavior,"" Marilyn Davenport told reporters gathered before the Orange County Republican Party headquarters in Fullerton, California.  ""I say unwise because I didn't stop to think about the historic implications of what I was sending."" ""Unintentionally I have offended many,"" Davenport added.  ""Knowing what I now know, I would never have sent the e-mail."" Davenport recently found herself in a storm of controversy after forwarding an e-mail she says she received from a friend.  It contained a doctored photo styled like a family portrait, showing two adult chimpanzees and a baby.  The younger chimpanzee had a photo of Obama's face superimposed over the animal's face. The caption that ran with the photo read, ""Now you know why no birth certificate."" The chairman of the Orange County Republican Party, Scott Baugh, called for her resignation in a Twitter message posted on the group's website.  California's Democratic Party has also demanded that Davenport step down. But during Wednesday's news conference, Davenport said she would not resign her post, citing an overwhelming number of appeals she has received from her constituency asking her not to do so. She represents the state's 72nd Assembly District for the Republican Central Committee. When queried by reporters about who she may have offended, Davenport responded, ""I assume that I offended the black people.  And having friends that are black I never intended for that, not at all."" Davenport said repeatedly that she is not racist, a sentiment echoed by her husband, Dick, who stood at her side as she faced reporters.  ""We've been involved in many  interracial activities,"" he said, ""and we have no animosity toward any person."" The e-mail in question, according to Davenport, was political satire.  ""I don't think i would consider it racist,"" she told reporters.  ""It's a political satire.  Pretty much about bringing up the birth certificate, or lack of it.  It wasn't about black, white or other.  I had no intention of doing anything that would be racist.  I guess I'm political and I thought of it only in a political stance."" Davenport went on to say that the e-mail grabbed her attention because of concerns she has about where Obama was born and where he went to school.  ""I am concerned, knowing the responsibility of a president, that we should know these things, shouldn't we?  There are some that are really adamant about it and I wonder why he doesn't tell us. ... From what I hear in the media, he's not brought forth his college records and his birth certificate."" Davenport is referring to claims made by what is called the ""birther"" movement.  These groups believe that the president was not born in the United States and his birth certificate is a forgery, making him ineligible to be president under the U.S. Constitution. Obama and his staff produced copies of his birth certificate when he was running for president in 2008. Despite her professed concerns over his place of birth, Davenport addressed her apologies directly to Obama.  ""To the president, I would say absolutely that it was inappropriate and absolutely I would not do that again.""","Marilyn Davenport apologizes once again for forwarding e-mail .

"Washington (CNN) -- Military prosecutors have recommended the death penalty for the accused mastermind of the deadly 2000 bombing of the destroyer USS Cole. The announcement Wednesday from the Defense Department is another signal the case against Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri will be moving closer to trial before a military commission. As one of 16 ""high-value"" detainees, he has been held for years at the U.S. Navy's detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. If approved, this would be the first death penalty trial in the reconfigured military trial system. Intelligence sources have said al-Nashiri headed al Qaeda operations in the Persian Gulf region before his 2002 capture by U.S. intelligence agents. CIA Director Michael Hayden confirmed six years later that al-Nashiri and two other high-value terror suspects were subjected to waterboarding, a harsh interrogation technique. The chief prosecutor recommended capital charges against the 46-year-old Saudi native. He has been formally recharged with planning the bombing attack on the U.S. Navy vessel, which was in the Gulf of Aden near Yemen. Two suicide bombers rammed a garbage barge full of explosives into the USS Cole during a refueling stop. Seventeen sailors were killed, and 47 others were injured. The blast left a 40-by-40-foot hole in the port side of the Norfolk, Virginia-based guided-missile destroyer, which was carrying a crew of 293. Al-Nashiri also is charged with heading the aborted attack on the destroyer USS The Sullivans that same year. The decision to formally move ahead with the prosecution had been expected for weeks, ever since Defense Secretary Robert Gates in January lifted a previous order that had prevented any new cases from moving forward. The final decision about whether the death penalty can be pursued is now in the hands of retired Vice Adm. Bruce McDonald. In military terminology he is the convening authority of the military commissions, the equivalent of a civilian criminal court. The American Civil Liberties Union, however, said the ""broken military commissions system"" should not be used to try al-Nashiri. ""We are deeply disturbed that the Obama administration has chosen to use the military commissions to try a capital case in which much of the evidence is reportedly based on hearsay and therefore not reliable enough to be admissible in federal court,"" said Hina Shamsi, director of the ACLU's National Security Project. ""Allowing hearsay is a backdoor way of allowing evidence that may have been obtained through torture. ""All of our concerns about the inherent unfairness of the military commissions are compounded in cases like this one, in which the result could be death,"" Shamsi said. ""The Constitution and international law rightly require enhanced protections in death penalty cases, but the military commissions are incapable of providing those necessary protections."" Yemen had separately sentenced the man to death in absentia for his alleged role in the Cole attack. His four-year custody in secret overseas CIA prisons before his 2006 transfer to Guantanamo is expected to be a key point of contention in any trial, since al-Nashiri did not have access to legal counsel for months nor had any charges been filed against him. It is unclear what rules of evidence the government could present that would withstand judicial scrutiny. Military justice rules allow al-Nashiri to have defense counsel represent him. He was charged in December 2008 before a military commission in Guantanamo, but the charges were suspended a few months later when the Obama administration took over and sought a fresh review of all detainees at the overseas prison. Later that year Attorney General Eric Holder announced al-Nashiri, alleged 9/11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and several other key terror suspects would face prosecution in the military justice system. The Obama administration had considered transferring some terror suspects to the United States for prosecution in either special military or civilian courts. But the president earlier this month announced all prosecutions would be in military courts in Guantanamo. The CIA has admitted tapes of al-Nashiri's interrogation at a secret location in 2002 were destroyed in 2005. Waterboarding involves strapping a person to a surface, covering his or her face with cloth and pouring water on the face to simulate the sensation of drowning. Critics have called it torture. Destruction of CIA tapes sparked concerns . During his Combatant Status Review Tribunal -- a preliminary court proceeding -- at Guantanamo in March 2007, al-Nashiri acknowledged knowing al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden and said he had accepted money from him. But bin Laden gave many people money to help them get married or conduct businesses, al-Nashiri said. Al-Nashiri said he is not a member of al Qaeda, according to the 4-year-old documents. He said he knew the perpetrators of the bombing because he had business dealings with them in the fishing industry. The suspect said he ""was tortured into confession, and once he made a confession his captors were happy and they stopped questioning him,"" according to a statement read during a 2007 hearing. ""Also, the detainee states that he made up stories during the torture in order to get (the torture) to stop."" In addition to Mohammed, charges could be forthcoming against Ahmed al-Darbi -- a Saudi man accused in the failed plot to bomb oil tankers in the Straits of Hormuz; and Obaydullah, an Afghan accused of planting explosives. The last military execution was in 1961, involving a U.S. Army private who had been convicted of rape and attempted murder of an Austrian girl.

"(CNN) -- Authorities in the Mexican north-central state of Durango have confirmed the discovery of 26 bodies in a mass grave. According to the Durango State's Attorney's Office, the bodies were found in a residential area in the capital city of the same name. Officials say the bodies found late Wednesday were already badly decomposed and so far they haven't been able to identify the victims. The bodies were found in a lot apparently belonging to an auto shop located in the residential area known as ""Las Fuentes."" According to local media reports, four other bodies were found on April 11, but the Durango State Attorney's Office did not immediately confirm that information. Crime scene pictures obtained by the Diario Contexto de Durango newspaper after the bodies had been removed show shallow mass graves right next to a brick wall. The area had already been cordoned off by authorities. The grisly discovery comes in the same week that authorities in Tamaulipas, a Mexican state that shares a border with Texas, confirmed they have so far found 116 bodies in multiple mass graves. Fifty-nine bodies were originally found on April 6 in eight mass graves in the town of San Fernando, located 90 miles south of Brownsville, Texas. As the investigation widened, authorities kept on finding more bodies, some in groups of several dozen. Sixteen San Fernando police officers were arrested last week for allegedly protecting those responsible for the mass graves that had been uncovered, according to the Mexican attorney general's office. Martin Omar Estrada Luna, an alleged drug kingpin nicknamed ""El Kilo,"" was captured last Saturday in connection with the mass graves. According to officials, Estrada is a presumed leader of Los Zetas. The Mexican drug cartel has operated for years in the area of San Fernando. The investigation in Tamaulipas began after reports of bus passengers in northeastern Mexico being forcibly removed from buses and taken away by heavily armed men. Another 72 bodies were found in San Fernando last August. They were identified as the remains of Central and South American immigrants on their way to the United States. Another presumed member of Los Zetas identified as Jose Manuel Garcia Soto was arrested earlier this month as a suspect in the death of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agent Jaime Zapata. Zapata and his partner were ambushed in the state of San Luis Potosi while traveling from the northern city of Monterrey to Mexico City. His partner survived.","Mexican authorities uncovered a mass grave in the north-central state of Durango .

"(CNN) -- Evelyn Einstein, who spent the last years of her life trying to fight for money generated by her late grandfather Albert's estate, has died, her close friend said Wednesday. The friend, Allen Wilkinson, said the two had just started to work on her memoirs. ""She always said her grandfather wasn't this great god of science, to her he was just Grandpa,"" Wilkinson said. Einstein had been ill for years suffering from heart problems and diabetes. She died at her home in Albany, California, last week, Wilkinson said. Albert Einstein made many contributions to modern science, but it's the videos, bobblehead dolls and Halloween masks using his image that continue to generate millions of dollars long after his death. Evelyn Einstein told CNN she hadn't received a dime from the marketing and sales of Einstein merchandise, while others have profited. ""I'm outraged,"" she told CNN in a February interview, adding that she was a 69-year-old cancer survivor and needed the money for health care. ""It's hard for me to believe they would treat the family the way they have, which has been abysmally."" Her grandfather, the German-born physicist who formulated the general theory of relativity, bequeathed the literary rights for the more than 75,000 papers and other items in his estate to the Hebrew University of Jerusalem when he died in 1955. The Israeli university also owns the rights to his likeness, using a Los Angeles-based company called Greenlight LLC to handle licensing for items such as Einstein apparel, mugs, puzzles, coins, posters and other collectibles. ""What does a bobblehead have to do with a literary estate?"" asked Evelyn Einstein, who said she had been ignored by the university in her requests for an arrangement that would allow her to profit from the sales. Just recently she had begun preparations to sue the university. The school responded with a statement saying, ""Einstein left all of his intellectual property, encompassing his literary estate and personal papers, to the Hebrew University, including the rights to the use of his image."" The statement added that ""the income of the university from the use of his image is dedicated to scientific research."" Greenlight spokesman Dan Perlet said the company has strict guidelines covering the dozens of annual requests to license the Einstein name, including ones from Disney and Baby Einstein. It asks whether the companies seek to promote the scientists' values, intellectual curiosity and innovation, Perlet said. Einstein, known for his wry sense of humor when he was alive, is paid homage in an animated television show called ""Little Einsteins"" long after his death. The show, which airs on Disney Playhouse, has generated DVDs, books and toys. The famed physicist was crowned Time magazine's person of the century in 1999, where he was described as ""the pre-eminent scientist in a century dominated by science. A memorial service for Evelyn Einstein is planned for June. She requested that her ashes be scattered in the Berkeley, California, marina.","Einstein's granddaughter had been fighting for money from his estate .

"(CNN) -- If you ever feel overwhelmed at work, imagine breaking up fights and taking a puck to the face while trying to earn a not-so-great salary. Alex Stagnone's face once needed eight stitches while on the job, but he quickly returned to the ice, ready for another 20 minutes of relentless action. ""That's hockey,"" is a common response from any player when suffering sport-related injuries. But Stagnone, 23, is a linesman with the ECHL, the NHL's double-A league. ""Ninety-five percent of hockey players wouldn't take our job,"" said hockey official Graham Skilliter, referring to the lower pay, heavy travel schedule, verbal abuse and stiff competition for a coveted officiating position in the NHL. Skilliter is an ECHL referee or ""the boss on the ice."" They make all final decisions on calls, penalties and disputed goals. Linesmen follow the action, break up fights, call minor penalties and drop the puck. Officials face a crowd of hockey fans who will never be satisfied with every call -- and fans aren't shy about voicing it. ""You get booed a lot, but you learn to like it. You get so used to it, it kind of becomes comical,"" Stagnone said, adding he tries not to take it personally. After growing up playing hockey, Stagnone attended one of USA Hockey's weeklong summer camps taught by seasoned supervisors. He then worked his way up through the tiered levels of hockey. Joe Ernst, director of Officiating for the ECHL, hires skilled skaters with good judgment who are hungry for a spot in the NHL and are physically and mentally tough. While the hockey players get regular line changes, officials only get a real break every 30 minutes. ""Our general rule of thumb is to be in as good of shape as the players, if not better,"" Skilliter said. ""The players will be out for 45 seconds and go red line as hard as they can. For us, it's more of a marathon."" During the playoffs under way now, the officials face more pressure than normal because their calls could land an important player in the penalty box or disallow a goal. So each call could have an affect on who wins the league title. Both referees and linesmen need thick skin to deal with angry coaches and players over disputed calls. ""You have to stay professional no matter how unprofessionally someone may treat you. It's keeping your cool when most people would lose it,""  Stagnone said. Officials also have to anticipate plays before they happen. It's called ""hockey sense,"" and it can't be taught, Skilliter said.  Successful officials tune into their hockey sense by blocking out personal off-ice issues at all times, he said. Once a full-time fireman,  Skilliter, a 26-year-old Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, native, now regularly travels from East Coast to West Coast. ""When we have days off, we call them 'GTL' or gym/tan/laundry days,"" Skilliter said. ""At our level, if we don't work, we don't get paid, so we try and stay as healthy as possible."" Since becoming a full-time official this season, Stagnone has worked 94 games between the ECHL and the slightly more skilled American Hockey League. Working developmental leagues required him to live in Omaha, Nebraska, for the last two years. This season, Stagnone relocated to Greenville, South Carolina, to work as one of 69 linesmen for the ECHL's southeastern teams. The men are competing against others in the field for a narrow chance in the NHL while making little pay; officiating in the lower leagues may seem like it has little to recommend itself as a career. Skilliter recommends having a solid back-up career in place, because leagues can only hire a few guys at a time.  If you can't imagine not wearing the stripes, ask about officiating at your local hockey rink. ""You can have a career where you work 9 to 5, but it's not near as exciting as this,"" Skilliter said. ""There are no guarantees. You have to put your life on hold and you never get to go home. You have to be a little nuts."" The pressure of making quick judgments on disputed goals or penalties is part of officiating life, but never so much as right now during the playoffs. ""In the playoffs, when the crowd gets going and there have been some big hits and things are going crazy, you don't know what to expect next,"" Stagnone said. ""That's when you just kind of think to yourself, 'Wow, this is a pretty good job.'""","Getting hit by pucks and breaking up fights is just one challenge for hockey officials .

It had a crew of 22 on board: six Italians and 16 Filipino nationals, the naval force said. The force did not have information on the crew's condition or the pirates' demands.

"(CNN) -- Even before he was officially declared president, Michel Martelly was making the rounds in Washington. The bad boy of Haitian music was not going to waste a minute in starting the job of a lifetime, something particularly daunting in Haiti, where past administrations stand accused of massive corruption and fraud. His supporters say they elected him for being an outsider. They believed his promises that he would lead his nation out of despair. Now he appears ready to show them tangible proof that Haiti is finally moving forward. He said he had already begun doing just that on his trip to Washington. ""The message I am carrying back is that the international world, the financial institutions are ready to back up this new government,"" Martelly told CNN Thursday as he prepared to return home. ""It is important to rebuild confidence and trust in this process,"" he said. ""And that can only be done through transparency."" As a first step, Martelly proposed setting up an e-governance system that would enable ordinary Haitians to access information on a website and even post complaints or expose fraud anonymously. ""We will also do it by example,"" he said. ""The government has not served its people. It has been 14 months since the earthquake and people are still living in tents."" Martelly met Wednesday with Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and officials at the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and the Inter-American Development Banks. Those meetings came before Haiti's election council officially declared him the winner Wednesday night with 67.67% of the presidential vote, finally ending a balloting process that began in late-November and was drawn out by irregularities. Martelly responded to the announcement on Twitter. ""Begin to take our tools, to clean our country, to get to work,"" he said in Creole. Speaking to reporters Thursday at the National Press Club, Martelly said his meeting with Clinton was ""productive."" ""We discussed ways of streamlining U.S. aid to Haiti,"" he said. ""We will ... strengthen our partnership with the United States and its people. As President Barack Obama and Secretary Clinton stated many times, we need to strengthen the capacity of Haitian institutions so they can answer to the needs of the Haitian people."" Martelly's candidacy was unexpected -- he was better known as Sweet Micky, the kompa singer with flamboyant stage presence. He appealed to voters who had grown weary with the status quo and what they perceived as a lack of progress after the devastating 2010 earthquake. ""The reconstruction process is despairingly slow,"" he said Wednesday, citing it as a key complaint of the electorate. ""This is why recovering and restarting the economy is a fundamental necessity for my government."" Since the earthquake, Haiti has received more than $1 billion in donations from Americans through several non-governmental organizations. In addition, the U.S. government has provided some $1.5 billion in aid. Signs of renewal are appearing in Haiti's capital, Port-au-Prince. On Wednesday, lawmakers there received a temporary parliament building in place of the nation's Legislative Palace, which was demolished after the earthquake. But ""Haiti today is the republic of NGOs,"" Martelly said Thursday. ""The state has been weakened and this must change. We need to build up the state's institutions while making the valuable work of the NGOs more effective."" ""My focus, as I promised during my campaign, is to revive and modernize Haiti's economy as its new president and provide free access to education, moving people out of tents by jump-starting reconstructions and focusing on the agricultural sector,"" he said. After their meeting, Clinton pledged U.S. support for progress in Haiti, referring to Martelly by his campaign nickname: Tet Kale. ""Now I'm told the literal translation of that slogan is bald head, which doesn't need any further explanation,"" she said after meeting with him. ""But Tet Kale is also an expression that means all the way. And the people of Haiti may have a long road ahead of them, but as they walk it, the United States will be with you all the way. Initial results in the first round of voting put Martelly in third place and ousted him from a runoff. But after weeks of review, the final results ranked him second. He was then able to defeat former first lady Mirlande Manigat in the runoff election. Martelly will be inaugurated May 14 in Port-au-Prince. He said one of his first actions as president will be to nominate high court judges. Creating an independent judiciary will send an important signal, he said. ""We have to establish a rule of law,"" he said. ""We want justice for everyone."" Martelly admitted the tasks ahead seem herculean in nature. But he is determined to seize upon the moment. ""I am excited to take command and make the right decisions for my country,"" he said. CNN's Padmananda Rama and Journalist Allyn Gaestel contributed to this report.","Martelly says he will set up an e-governance system to stave corruption .

"(CNN) -- When most people go to Hawaii, they head to the beach to relax and get a tan. Sarah Vowell locks herself in historical libraries. The result of that sun-free research is her latest take on history, ""Unfamiliar Fishes."" ""I came to Hawaii because it had been attacked,"" she writes in her book, referring to her visit to the USS Arizona Memorial in Pearl Harbor, after she compares the combination of foods she was eating for lunch to the ethnic variety of the current Hawaiian citizens. She acts like a tour guide on a trip through time -- stopping at this place and that in Hawaii to expound on historical events -- often flavoring the accounts with personal anecdotes or wry comments. When writing about Hawaiian royals in 1819 dropping one taboo on what women could eat, she notes, ""As a female carnivore, I'm delighted that half the population was freed to eat pork."" Exploring U.S. history in a very chatty tone and with personal asides has put several of Vowell's books on bestseller lists. In ""Assassination Vacation,"" she dipped into the times of political violence that claimed the lives of U.S. Presidents Abraham Lincoln, James Garfield and William McKinley. In ""Wordy Shipmates"" she wrote about the English Puritans that settled the Massachusetts Bay Colony. The author, essayist and frequent public radio commentator can hold her own against the quick wits of TV political satirists John Stewart and Stephen Colbert as she proved on her latest book tour. With her writing, Vowell says she aims to put a human face on the people from the past. She describes the bloody tactics that Kamehameha the Great used to end more than a century of warfare and establish the Hawaiian monarchy in 1810. Like a tourist she also details how her 8-year-old nephew twists his underwear into a loincloth and performs ""an amusing if insensitive impression"" of the warrior. Vowell finds the pluck of the New England missionaries admirable for their willingness at barely 20 years old to leave home, family and country to sail to ""the most isolated island chain in the world"" aboard a ship ""so crappy it made the Mayflower look like the QE2."" But their mission to convert the heathens to Christianity does not impress the self-described godless heathen author. She opines ""there's not much difference between Jehovah and Ku (except that once a year the Hawaiian god of war actually takes time off)."" Vowell describes the native hula dances -- including one that is accompanied by chants praising the genitals of the king -- as part of an ""academic nearly-religious spiritual tradition that is incredibly rigorous."" There are so many rules on behavior, land management, fishing and other areas that Vowell describes the Hawaiian culture as very conservative. So to her, the disagreements between the missionaries and the Hawaiians about what was proper behavior, ""was like watching two kind of conservative traditions squaring off."" She admits that she especially likes writing about historical characters that she didn't like -- including a man who faked being a Mormon leader as he unsuccessfully plotted to establish his own Pacific empire. But one of her favorite scenes to write about was the funeral procession of King Liholiho who had died along with his wife from measles during a trip to visit King George IV in England in 1823. Their bodies were returned to Hawaii aboard a British Royal Navy frigate commanded by the seventh Lord Byron, a cousin of the late poet. Vowell describes a ""fantastical scene"" of all these people participating in a procession through Honolulu: Hawaiian royals in Western clothes, nine other Hawaiians in yellow-feathered war cloaks, British Royal Navy officers in their uniforms and the missionaries in their black wool outfits. And then there were native Hawaiian guards who were wearing a variety of western garb - but who apparently didn't understand the need for pants. Vowell says the changes in the years that followed mostly had a negative impact on the Hawaiian people. Much of their land fell into the hands of the sugar plantation owners, the descendants of the missionaries overthrew Hawaii's last monarch and despite the natives' petitions and pleas -- U.S. politicians maneuvered to turn the kingdom into a U.S. territory. But while the results are somewhat sad, she says, learning more about the meetings of strangers in history has always intrigued the traveler in her. ""There's this part of me that wants to leave home and wants to see something new and wants to meet new people,"" she muses. ""Maybe that is how I, too, will meet my doom.""","Sarah Vowell's latest book explores the history of Hawaii and how it became a state .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- A hearing in Charlie Sheen's custody battle with estranged wife Brooke Mueller took place Tuesday in private, despite a request from the actor's lawyer that reporters be allowed to witness the proceeding. While the results were sealed by the judge, Mueller was smiling broadly as she left court, in contrast to a stone-faced Sheen. Los Angeles County, California, Superior Court Judge Hank Goldberg granted Mueller's request for privacy, agreeing with her lawyer that the publicity would not be good for the couple's twin 2-year-old sons. About an hour after he entered the courtroom, the actor departed, strolling down the hallway with a woman on one arm and lawyers and guards surrounding him. He looked straight ahead as he moved to a non-public elevator for a departure from the basement garage. Mueller, surrounded by cameras and reporters as she left the courthouse, smiled but said little. Asked how she was doing, she said, ""Excellent, now let's go home."" She then pushed through the scrum of media toward her limo. Sheen detoured Tuesday from the East Coast leg of his ""Violent Torpedo of Truth"" stage tour to ask Goldberg to award him full custody of the boys after Mueller failed to appear for a drug test that was required under their child-custody agreement. As he arrived Tuesday night in Washington for a performance, Sheen told a crowd of about 30 people gathered outside that he could not talk about his custody battle and didn't know the current status of his legal battle with Warner Bros. television over his firing from the CBS sitcom ""Two and a Half Men."" His performance was pushed back an hour as he was traveling cross-country from the hearing. ""I was about to make a phone call and see how that thing went today,"" Sheen said. ""I just landed, got a police escort from the airport. We ran more red lights than Brooke Mueller going to a pawn shop."" At the California hearing, Sheen's lawyer, Mark Gross, had argued that Mueller was ""a dollar short and a day late"" in asking for the case to be sealed since she did not ask the same last month when she accused Sheen of threatening to kill her. ""Now that she has failed to appear for a test, she wants it sealed,"" Gross said. But Goldberg was unmoved. ""I don't think it would be in the best interest of the children to be exposed to that material,"" he said. While the couple reached a custody agreement before filing for divorce last year, they have argued recently over visitation arrangements. The dispute boiled over in early March when Mueller asked for a restraining order, swearing in a statement that Sheen had threatened to kill her. ""I will cut your head off, put it in a box and send it to your mom,"" Mueller said that Sheen told her. The assertions were made in a court document that resulted in a court order that removed Sheen's sons from his home. In an interview the next day with NBC's ""Today Show,"" Sheen denied that he had threatened Mueller. The quote against him was fabricated, he said, calling the allegation ""colorful."" Sheen launched his nationwide stage tour last month after Warner Bros. fired him. Sheen's lawyers were also at another hearing Tuesday morning. A judge will decide if the actor's legal battle with the studio over his firing will be heard in open court or in arbitration. CNN's Jessica Rosgaard contributed to this report.","NEW: Charlie Sheen arrives in Washington, says he can't discuss custody battle .

"(CNN) -- California Superior Court Judge Michael Pastor ruled Thursday that two autopsy photos of Michael Jackson can be submitted as evidence during the upcoming trial of Dr. Conrad Murray, a person inside the courtroom told CNN. Murray is charged with involuntary manslaughter. Authorities  allege that he gave Jackson propofol, a surgical anesthetic drug, that combined with several sedatives found in his blood to kill the singer on June 25, 2009, the Los Angeles County  coroner has said. Jury selection in Murray's trial began last month and will continue into  early May. Opening statements and testimony are scheduled to begin May  9. Los Angeles County District Attorney Steve Cooley and his team had filed a motion Tuesday to allow jurors to see the photos, arguing that California courts ""permit (prosecutors) to admit autopsy photographs, as they are relevant, (that) will illustrate the testimony of witnesses and will enhance the jury's understanding of the prosecution's case."" The photographs will be ""properly redacted as deemed appropriate,"" the prosecution said. ""These limited photographs will help demonstrate that Michael Jackson was generally in excellent health and that, while thin, his body weight was within the normal range,"" the prosecution said in its motion, adding that the medical examiner and other experts may reference the autopsy photos during the trial. The defense has argued that Jackson self-administered the propofol in a desperate attempt to get sleep before a rehearsal. Murray  told investigators he was trying to wean Jackson off propofol in the  last days of his life, but that he used it along with other  drugs to help the pop star sleep that last morning. The defense  claims that the singer's dermatologist, Dr. Arnold Klein, injected  Jackson with powerful painkillers dozens of times in the last months of  his life, unknown to Murray. The Medical Board  of California and Los Angeles County coroner investigated Klein after  Jackson's death, but he was never charged, and no action was taken to  revoke his medical license. Earlier this month, Michael Jackson's dermatologist was ordered to give copies of the pop  star's medical records to Murray's attorneys. Defense attorney Ed Chernoff argued he needed the financial  and medical information to make the case that Jackson, who he said was ""a  desperate man in many respects,"" gave himself the fatal dose of surgical  anesthesia while the doctor was not watching. Judge Pastor did not order estate executors to give the defense detailed financial information about money the singer owed when he died. But he did say that Jackson's former business manager, Tohme Tohme, must testify in Murray's trial.","NEW: ""Properly redacted"" photos will show Jackson ""in excellent health,"" prosecutors say .

"(CNN)  -- CNN colleagues have been paying tribute to the network's former Jerusalem correspondent Jerrold Kessel, who died Thursday at age 65 after a long battle with cancer. Kessel was a tireless reporter in a troubled part of the world. ""Jerrold worked for CNN for 13 years from 1990 to 2003 during some of the most spectacular highs and lows of the Middle East and was one of the network's regular reporting faces from the region,"" said Jerusalem Bureau Chief Kevin Flower. ""He was a passionate journalist and a guiding force for many he worked with."" Kessel was born in South Africa and moved to Israel as a young man. He was a widely published print reporter who worked for the Jerusalem Post and Israel Radio before joining CNN as a field producer, then correspondent and deputy bureau chief. He led CNN's viewers through events ranging from the Oslo accords between Israel and the Palestinians, to the assassination of Yitzhak Rabin, Israeli elections and the intifada. A portly man with a fuzzy white beard, Kessel's gentle appearance and warm friendly manner gave no hint of his inner intensity. He was known to colleagues for his seven-day-a-week commitment to the story, his voluble personality and his insider's knowledge of Middle East events. ""Jerrold was an expert on the Israeli-Palestinian story, and managed to explain the complicated politics of the Mideast on our air for so many years,"" said Parisa Khosravi, CNN's Senior Vice President of international newsgathering. CNN Anchor Jim Clancy, a former Beirut correspondent well-traveled through the region in his own right, said he also benefited from Kessel's experience. ""Jerrold always went out of his way to help others understand the context of the story and shared his knowledge and his sources unselfishly."" Kessel's encyclopedic knowledge of the region made him a favorite of CNN producers when news broke. As the network scrambled to figure out the story, Kessel could vamp on air as long as needed. ""If the producer said in his ear, 'keep going' there would be a hint of a smile, and he would keep right on going,"" said CNN Senior Editorial Director Richard Griffiths. Even faithful viewers would probably be surprised to learn that Kessel was devoted to cricket, his vegetarian diet and more profoundly, to his family. He is survived by his wife, son and four grandchildren.","CNN's former Jerusalem correspondent Jerrold Kessel dies from cancer .

"(CNN) -- For some survivors of the Deepwater Horizon disaster, escaping the inferno of the doomed rig made them feel like they'd cheated death. But living with the scars of what they witnessed that night, and the memory of the 11 men who perished when the rig exploded off the coast of Louisiana a year ago, has in many ways taken their lives away. ""I remember feeling invincible when it first happened. I remember driving in my truck on the way home after the rig exploded and (I) pushed the gas (pedal) to the floor and never let off it,"" says Daniel Barron. But the high Barron felt from surviving didn't last long. ""You have that guilty conscience of, 'Okay, I made it, that's great, but then these guys didn't.' Was there something I could have done to save more people?"" Barron says his guilt is compounded by physical and mental issues that are a result of the disaster. He suffers from memory loss, and has been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder and depression, according to medical records provided to CNN. He witnessed one of his good friends, whom he calls a ""fallen brother,"" die right in front of him when a second explosion rocked the rig. ""It literally picked him up . . . like a child would throw a toy . . . and he ended up bouncing off of the pedestal for the crane,"" he told CNN's Anderson Cooper shortly after the disaster. ""Just to see him get blown up like that, I mean, it was, it's heart-wrenching,"" Barron said. Barron says one night, the psychological pain and the guilt of surviving when so many friends did not, became overwhelming. ""I had a 6-shot pistol and I just wanted it to be over,"" he says. His wife discovered him playing Russian roulette and persuaded him to hand over the gun before it was too late. Douglas Brown, one of Barron's fellow survivors, also speaks of the guilt of surviving the disaster. ""I am thankful that I, I made it out alive but a lot of times, I don't -- there's a lot of times where I feel I should, I should have died there too, along with my friends,"" Brown said. Like Barron, Brown has been diagnosed with multiple mental issues including PTSD, traumatic brain injury, depression and anxiety, according to medical records. A third survivor, Matthew Jacobs, says he thinks of the 11 victims of the Deepwater Horizon every day and wakes up screaming from nightmares where he's re-living the explosions. ""It's something that I just can't quit, you know, get out of my head,"" he says. Jacobs first told the story of his harrowing escape to Cooper in the weeks after the disaster. He expected to die as his lifeboat, which was being lowered 75 feet down from the rig, was filling with smoke and started to free-fall after another explosion. ""I prayed for my family to let God know that I love my wife and that I love my kids,"" he said. In the year since, Jacobs and his wife have started divorce proceedings because of his mental issues including, post-traumatic stress disorder and depression, he says. Those mental issues are also corroborated by medical records provided to CNN. All three survivors say their physical and mental injuries have left them unable to work and they're suing their employer Transocean for lost wages and pain and suffering. While technically still employees, they have not set foot on a rig since the disaster and their employer stopped paying their salaries last December. They accuse Transocean of valuing profits over safety prior to the accident, and of valuing minimizing monetary losses over the welfare of its employees after it. In a statement, Transocean responded to their allegations writing: ""From the first hours, Transocean has focused on providing support for its employees and the families of those who were lost aboard the Deepwater Horizon, including continued full pay and benefits for eight months following the incident and professional counseling for those in need. Today, more than one third of the Deepwater Horizon crew are back to work at Transocean and the entire company continues to be inspired by their courage and commitment."" Transocean still pays for some of the three survivors' health care costs and gives them a small monthly stipend for room and board as required by law. The survivors were offered an additional six months of pay to drop any claims, but they declined, according to legal records provided to CNN. On the anniversary of the disaster, the survivors say they hope to one day put the accident behind them but also hope people never forget the 11 men who died that night on the Deepwater Horizon. ""I would ask people just to remember them and pray for their families, because I know those families are still suffering,"" Brown says. Watch Anderson Cooper 360° weeknights 10pm ET.

"(CNN) -- Japan's government has lifted restrictions on vegetables and milk from some parts of the country's north after inspections found radiation levels below legal limits for three straight weeks, a top government official announced Friday. The move lifts a ban on spinach and kakina, another leafy green vegetable, from Gunma Prefecture, southwest of the quake-damaged Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. Milk from the Aizu area of Fukushima Prefecture, inland from the plant, will also be allowed for sale, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yukio Edano told reporters. ""The level of radiation has stayed low for last three samplings,"" said Edano, the government's point man for the nuclear crisis. The government has slapped bans on a variety of farm products products grown or produced around the plant, which has spewed radioactive particles into the sky and water since the March 11 earthquake and tsunami that knocked out its coolant systems. Workers are still battling to keep three damaged reactors at the plant from overheating four weeks later. Radiation levels have been trending downward in the area around the plant since mid-March, according to data released by government ministries. And farmers have been pushing Japanese authorities to lower standards on radiation in food, calling them excessively stringent and not necessary to protect consumers. Edano said Monday that the government's legal standards would not be changed, but food would be allowed for sale if it passed three weekly tests.","A ban on spinach and kakina from Gunma Prefecture has been lifted .

"Cairo (CNN) -- Thousands of demonstrators who gathered  in Cairo's Tahrir Square for a protest titled ""Day of Justice and Cleansing"" confronted two officers and sent them running late Friday, according to a witness. The numbers in the square have swelled dramatically compared to last Friday's rally, in part because the Muslim Brotherhood has now joined alongside secular, liberal groups to put pressure on the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces, which currently rules Egypt. Demonstrators stepped up their demands this week. Muhammad Taman, a spokesman for the January 25 Coalition, told CNN the diverse collection of political groups are demanding Egyptian authorities bring ousted president Hosni Mubarak before a court for his alleged role in the deaths of hundreds of activists last January and February and on corruption charges. If Mubarak is not prosecuted, Taman said, activists are prepared to organize a march towards the Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheikh, where Mubarak has been living on his estate since he stepped down from office on February 11. ""This is the army's last chance,"" Taman warned. Mubarak's eldest son, Gamal, is expected to appear before the Justice Ministry's Illicit Profiteering Committee on Sunday. Meanwhile, Mubarak's long-time chief of staff, Zakaria Azmi, was questioned and then arrested on Thursday by Egypt's general prosecutor. Azmi is being investigated for alleged corrupt activities. He was shown on Egyptian television Friday being escorted to a vehicle by uniformed Egyptian police while bystanders chanted, ""Thief, thief!"" An army lieutenant colonel and a military police officer tried to walk to the center of square, where they were surrounded by demonstrators who chanted ""get out, get out,"" said journalist Mohamed Fadel Fahmy, who witnessed the incident. Within moments, members of the crowd began pushing the officers and knocking their hats off their heads. ""The officers got scared and started running and they were pursued,"" said Fahmy. Demonstrators are protecting 15 army officers and soldiers who broke ranks with the Egyptian military and joined Friday's Tahrir Square protest, ignoring a warning from the top military brass that any uniformed troops participating in the rally would be arrested. Some of the officers addressed the demonstration, demanding Egypt's ruling military council be replaced by a presidential committee of civillians.","NEW: Two Egyptian officers forced to leave square, witness says .

Mansour El-Kikhia, a Texas college professor, called his return a ""new adventure."" ""It's a fantasy land. ""Alice in Wonderland,"" ""Waiting for Godot,"" it's unbelievable."" El-Kikhia told ""In The Arena"" host Eliot Spitzer. ""This has taught me to look at life in a different way."" El-Kikhia is an adviser to the rebel opposition against Libyan dictator Moammar Gadhafi. He said the rebels are battling uncertainty. Recent reports say rebels are questioning the commitment of western countries such as the United States, France and Italy to the opposition fight. ""There this constant question going on in their minds."" El-Kikhia said. ""Will Gadhafi come back? Will the allies let us down? Will they help us?"" On Wednesday, the United Kingdom, France and Italy announced they sent military advisers to aid Libyan rebels. Obama on Thursday approved the use of armed drones in Libya. El-Kikhia said the rebels are divided into two military groups. ""We have the actual military itself. Gen. Abdul Fattah Younis, whom I personally think is very, very capable,"" he said. ""He (is) working very hard to train young men to actually take over, to be able to defend the city."" El-Kikhia said the second group of rebels at times can be a problem for the opposition. ""You have the other group, the insurgents. They're fixated on removing Gadhafi. They're more of a hindrance than help. But they keep on moving forward toward Tripoli and they're being pushed back,"" El-Kikhia said. Spitzer pressed El-Kikhia to explain in detail what the rebels needed from U.S. forces. When asked whether they needed recognition and weapons, he said America's role shouldn't be limited to force. He said he wants to see the U.S. advising Libyans on how to sustain its fragile democracy. ""(Libya) is like a child. This is a new child that just opened their eyes and they need as much help as they can,"" he said.  ""Help guide the Libyans. It doesn't require total military force. It requires administration, some help (and) advice.""","""It's a fantasy land, ""Alice in Wonderland,"" he says .

"Toronto (CNN) -- Two men authorities say played a key role in a 2009 al Qaeda plot to bomb packed New York subway cars now face charges in Canada, although their whereabouts are unknown, police said Tuesday. At a news conference in Winnipeg, Canadian police accused Ferid Imam, a former student at the University of Manitoba, of training Najibullah Zazi, the Afghanistan-born New Yorker who has pleaded guilty to trying to bomb the city's subway system. Imam was identified by the New York plotters as a weapons instructor who went by the name of ""Youseff,"" police said. ""This extensive and thorough national security investigation has provided us with the evidence we require to lay criminal charges,"" said Bill Robinson, assistant commissioner with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. Imam, 30, is charged with instructing to carry out terrorist activity and conspiracy to participate in the activity of a terrorist group. Another Canadian, Maiwand Yar, 27, was charged with conspiracy to participate in activity of a terrorist group and participation in the activity of terrorism. Yar is also a former student at the University of Manitoba. Imam and Yar are now the subjects of an international manhunt that is believed to include the CIA. Canadian authorities said the Canadians left their homes in Manitoba in 2007, bound for Pakistan, in order to train for and carry out terrorist acts against NATO forces in Afghanistan. Robinson said the investigation is ongoing. ""We continue to work with Canadian border services and domestic and international security partners on this matter,"" he said. Canadian authorities confirm to CNN that their Pakistani counterparts provided help to them during the investigation, but they now have no firm leads on the whereabouts of the two men. ""Are they still alive? There's been no proof of life for more than a year,"" Gilles Michaud, the RCMP's assistant commissioner, told CNN. Police believe the suspects were in the tribal areas of Pakistan about a year ago, but have had no credible intelligence about their whereabouts since then. Canadian counterterrorism and government officials say the radicalization of these men, and others from North America and Europe represents a true reflection of a small but dedicated group of recruits that pose a direct threat to national security. ""There is no set criteria. It affects all walks of life. These were well-educated, young individuals with no past criminal history and supportive families,"" Michaud said. U.S. authorities charged Imam in July with providing material support and receiving military-type training from al Qaeda, according to an indictment unsealed Tuesday in the Eastern District of New York. Federal prosecutors allege that Imam, while in Pakistan in 2008, helped train Zazi and Zarein Ahmedzay advance of their plot to detonate bombs on subway trains on the eighth anniversary of the September 11 attacks, according to the indictment. Imam is also charged with use of a destructive device, the indictment said.","NEW: Canadian authorities have no firm leads on the suspects' whereabouts .

"Tokyo (CNN) -- It's billed as ""the happiest place on Earth."" And Friday, Disneyland's Tokyo theme park reopened in hopes of bringing some of that missing happiness back to the Japanese people. The park has been closed since the March 11 earthquake that devastated northern Japan and the electricity shortage that followed. Disney fans lined up as early as 6:30 a.m., an hour and a half before Friday's reopening, hoping to be the first into the park. Mickey and Minnie Mouse, Goofy, and a host of other Disney characters surprised visitors as the gates opened at 8 a.m. A sort of Disney hysteria swept over the crowd as Mickey danced in front of visitors minutes before the official opening of the park. ""We were so excited, we were almost crying,"" Tokyo Disneyland visitor Mika Hasegawa said. The re-opening comes at a critical time for Japan, as the country struggles to regain some semblance of normalcy after the earthquake and tsunami that killed 13,500 people in the country's northeast. Many Tokyo residents have refrained from excessive celebrations and parties out of respect for the victims. But Disneyland visitor Minako Ootsuka said that while Japanese people should be mindful of the disaster, it's also important to have a good time and release stress. Hiroshi Suzuki, public relations manager for Oriental Land Co. -- the company that owns Tokyo Disneyland -- agreed. He said visitors were so elated when they saw Mickey and the other characters, he wished he could bring that kind of happiness to all people in Japan. Other visitors to the park said they thought it was important to start getting out and spending money to get the economy running again. Erika Kanehira said she planned on visiting Tokyo Disneyland as often as she could and would also purchase merchandise to help the disaster area recover. For every guest admitted to the park through May 14, Tokyo Disneyland will donate 300 yen (about $4) to the Japanese Red Cross. The park will also be operating under shortened business hours in order to save power. Suzuki says the company hopes to get the park up and running on usual business hours as soon as possible. But most visitors are happy to have the park back at all. Tomomi Takehashi said Disneyland was a place where people can come to laugh and smile -- and that may be exactly what the Japanese public needs right now.","""We were so excited, we were almost crying,"" a park visitors says .

"Manchester United veteran Ryan Giggs has signed a new one-year contract that will extend his career to 21 seasons with the English Premier League leaders. The 37-year-old Welsh midfielder, seeking to help United win a record 19th English league title this year and his 12th, made his debut for his only team in March 1991. He has made a club-record 862 first-team outings, scoring 158 goals, as a key figure under manager Alex Ferguson -- who signed him on his 14th birthday from the youth development school of local rivals Manchester City. ""You run out of words to describe Ryan Giggs. He is a marvellous player and a wonderful man,"" Ferguson told United's website on Friday. Has Rooney joined the ranks of football's immortals? ""To have the desire and the ability to play at the top level in such a physically demanding position at his age requires a special person. ""He is still turning in man-of-the-match performances, and his experience is so vital for the younger players in the squad."" Giggs, twice a European Champions League winner, has kept up his record as the only player to score in every season since the English Premier League's inception in 1992. ""All I've ever wanted to do is play for United, and I've been lucky enough to do that for 20 years,"" he said, having extended his previous one-year deal. ""It's great to know I'm still contributing to the team's success and I feel I've got a lot to offer on and off the pitch.

"(CNN) -- World number one Rafael Nadal insists he is fully prepared for a punishing schedule leading up to the defense of his French Open title at Roland Garos in a month's time. The Spaniard had little time to celebrate his record-breaking victory over David Ferrer in the Monte Carlo Masters on Sunday, before flying home to participate in the Barcelona Open. Fresh from his landmark seventh successive Monaco title, Nadal has two more tournaments in the diary after Barcelona before he aims to claim a sixth title in Paris. But despite his history of injuries, the 24-year-old claims he is fit and ready for a bruising lead-in to the second major tennis championship of the year. ""During the match I was more tired than usual. But in general it was positive,"" he told the official ATP Tour web site. ""That's important because these kinds of matches improve your condition physically and mentally. ""It's negative because you spent a lot of time on court, you have to run a lot on court, it's always tough for the body. But if you talk about [what it does] mentally and physically, that can help a lot for the rest of the clay season."" Nadal has played 17 matches in the last four weeks but is due to appear at masters events in Rome and Madrid after defending his Barcelona title. The 24-year-old has a formidable record at the event he has won five times, tasting defeat just once in 25 matches, and says this is a vital period in shaping his season. ""That's the calendar. That's where I have to play my best, where I have to defend a lot of points,"" Nadal said. ""Indian Wells to Wimbledon is the most [important] part of the season for me. These four or five months are decisive in my season. ""Every year I did a fantastic clay court season. I have to try to do it another time. With these four or five tournaments, if I am playing very well, I'm going to have the biggest chances to have enough points to try to be in the top position at the end of the year ranking. ""That's the top of my system in general. So I have to try. I am healthy now, so why not?"" Despite his victory in Monte Carlo, Nadal says there are areas of his game he needs to work on -- something he is aiming to do when he faces the winner of the first round clash between Daniel Gimeno-Traver and Potito Starace. ""I think I can improve a few things for next weeks,"" Nadal said. ""I am sliding less than usual on clay. It is easier to defend well when you are sliding, especially to the forehand.

"(CNN) -- American golfer Stacy Lewis banished the ghosts of her nightmare final round at the 2008 U.S. Open when she clinched the Kraft Nabisco Championship by three shots on Sunday. The 26-year-old, whose grandfather died on the eve of the tournament at Mission Hills in California, claimed the first title of her professional career in the first of four major events in the 2011 women's season. ""Everybody in the family knew that he would have wanted me to finish out this week,"" she told the LPGA website. ""I mean, he lived via my golf. He loved watching it on TV. He recorded it every week so he could keep watching it over and over again. ""But him and my grandma, they both got to see me play the whole round today and they were out there with me, for sure."" Lewis, who won an unofficial rain-shortened LPGA Tour event as an amateur in her native Arkansas in 2007, had looked set to follow that up three years ago when she led the U.S. Open heading into the last day, but a final-round 78 ended her hopes of glory. It was a different story this time, though, as the world number 28 overhauled top-ranked defending champion Yani Tseng of Taiwan to finish on 13 under par after a round of 69. ""It doesn't even feel real yet,"" said Lewis, who turned pro in 2008 four years after having a titanium rod and five screws put in her back to cure her teenage problems with scoliosis. ""I don't know. I'm still trying to figure out if I actually won, but I played so good today and I was just proud of the way I hung in there."" The victory was all but assured for Lewis on the 17th hole, when she held a tricky putt while three-time major winner Tseng recorded a bogey. ""Probably the look on my face was I was shocked it went in, too, honestly,"" said Lewis of her finish on the penultimate hole. ""It was a putt you had to hit on the perfect line with the perfect speed for it to go in."" Tseng, who has won four titles already this year, closed with 74 to finish three shots back. ""I did my best. I tried my best today, and I didn't give her any shots today. So I hung in there until the last putt and smiled the whole way, whole day. So it was good and it was very good experience for me this time,"" the 22-year-old said. ""Golf is golf, so this is normal. I just didn't play well. And hopefully next tournament will be good, and I just really want to congratulate Stacy. She did really awesome."" American Michelle Wie achieved her first top-10 finish at a major since 2006 after ending the weekend sixth on three-under following a closing 69, leaving the 21-year-old one shot behind third-placed compatriots Katie Futcher, Morgan Pressel and Angela Stanford.","Stacy Lewis wins first career title at the Kraft Nabisco Championship in California .

"(CNN) -- The Verizon iPhone train started rolling this week, but Apple's main smartphone competitors aren't about to be left at the station. This week, cellular carriers released details about a trio of upcoming smartphones, all of which run an older version of Google's Android operating system. AT&T announced a March 6 release deadline for the Atrix 4G, a Motorola Mobility ""transformer"" phone that grabbed the spotlight at the Consumer Electronics Show last month. With a speedy dual-core processor inside, the Arix can be used as a media center or limited-function PC when connected to a television or monitor using a dock accessory. Motorola will also sell a laptop shell that allows the Atrix to essentially convert into a sort of netbook, complete with a keyboard. New details about the much-anticipated Atrix came on the same day Verizon Wireless began letting current customers pre-order the iPhone 4, formerly exclusive to AT&T in the U.S. At $200 with a two-year contract, the Atrix will be among the first to run on AT&T's faster data network and carry the ""4G"" branding. (For $500 with a contract, you get the phone and the laptop dock; the latter is also sold separately for $500.) The Atrix, an AT&T exclusive, will be available for pre-order starting on February 13. On the same day, AT&T will begin selling another so-called 4G phone. The second-largest U.S. carrier by subscribers announced the launch date and a $100 price tag, two-year agreement required, for HTC's Inspire 4G. That info came on Tuesday, kicking off a big week for smartphone news. The Inspire has a 4.3-inch screen -- the same large size as the Evo 4G. The new device will be the inaugural smartphone to offer AT&T's Mobile Hotspot service. Having long struggled to support the bandwidth needs of its millions of smartphone subscribers, AT&T lags behind competitors in offering this feature. Customers will have to pay an extra $20 per month to use the feature, which adds 2 gigabytes of wireless internet usage, the carrier said on Wednesday. T-Mobile USA, the fourth-largest U.S. network, said on Tuesday that it expects to begin selling the Galaxy S 4G from Samsung Electronics this month. It's similar to Samsung's several other Android handsets, but this one is compatible with T-Mobile's faster data network. All three of these new smartphones, strangely, come with a seven-month-old version of Android, called Froyo. Since releasing that version, Google launched another called Gingerbread, which powers a Samsung-made phone called the Nexus S. Google held a news conference on Wednesday to say developers are close to releasing the first device that will run the next Android, called Honeycomb, this month.","AT&T and T-Mobile announce details about three new Android phones this week .

"(Mashable) -- This is what the world looks like, according to the Facebook social graph. Facebook intern Paul Butler was interested in the locations of friendships, so he decided to create a visualization of Facebook connections around the globe. How local are our friends? Where are the highest concentration of friendships? How do political and geological boundaries affect them? Butler started by using a sample of 10 million friend pairs, correlated them with their current cities and then mapped that data using the longitude and latitude of each city. That was the easy part. Creating the right effect to show connecting relationships between thousands of cities proved to be a challenge. Butler wrote a fascinating Facebook note explaining some of the challenges he faced creating his visualization: . ""I began exploring it in R, an open-source statistics environment. As a sanity check, I plotted points at some of the latitude and longitude coordinates. To my relief, what I saw was roughly an outline of the world. Next I erased the dots and plotted lines between the points. After a few minutes of rendering, a big white blob appeared in the center of the map. Some of the outer edges of the blob vaguely resembled the continents, but it was clear that I had too much data to get interesting results just by drawing lines. I thought that making the lines semi-transparent would do the trick, but I quickly realized that my graphing environment couldn't handle enough shades of color for it to work the way I wanted. Instead I found a way to simulate the effect I wanted. I defined weights for each pair of cities as a function of the Euclidean distance between them and the number of friends between them. Then I plotted lines between the pairs by weight, so that pairs of cities with the most friendships between them were drawn on top of the others. I used a color ramp from black to blue to white, with each line's color depending on its weight. I also transformed some of the lines to wrap around the image, rather than spanning more than halfway around the world."" With a few more tweaks, he eventually came up with the amazing visualization you see here. At first glance, it provides some expected data -- the U.S. has the highest concentration of Facebook friendships, and Africa has the lowest concentration. While most of Russia and Antarctica are nowhere to be found, the rest of the world is easily identifiable. What do you think of the visualization? Does anything about it surprise you?

"(CNN) -- Ninety-five acres of farm land where young men in blue and gray fought and died during the epic Civil War battle is being added to Gettysburg National Military Park, federal officials said. Land that once belonged to the now-closed Gettysburg Country Club is where major fighting occurred on the first day of battle on July 1, 1863. Interior Secretary Ken Salazar on Friday thanked the Conservation Fund and The Civil War Trust for helping to make the department's acquisition of the former Emanuel Harman Farm possible. ""Gettysburg will always have a sacred place in America's heritage for the pivotal role it played in our nation's history and for the enormity of the sacrifice that took place here,"" Salazar said in a statement. ""With the addition of the Emanuel Harman Farm to the Gettysburg National Military Park, we are able to include another important chapter in the story that helped shape our country."" In 1863, the property was part of the historic Harman and Abraham Spangler farms where Confederate Brigades advanced and retreated during an attack on the Union positions on McPherson and Seminary Ridges, according to the National Park Service. The National Park Service has long tried to add the tract. In the 1950s, the property was developed into the Gettysburg Country Club, which closed in 2008. A developer who bought the property and had planned to build more than 200 housing units agreed to the sale, the Interior Department said. The purchase price was $1.6 million, according to the Philadelphia Inquirer. CNN left a message with the department Saturday. The Civil War Trust is pursuing the purchase of three other pieces of the battlefield at Gettysburg, where the Confederate forces of Gen. Robert E. Lee were turned back after three days of combat that included Pickett's Charge. ""Even as we celebrate this great success, we must remember that other vital pieces of the Gettysburg story are still vulnerable,"" trust president James Lighthizer said in a statement.","The Gettysburg battlefield is adding 95 acres .

"(CNN) -- Arsenal's hopes of winning the English Premier League title were dealt a severe blow as Arsene Wenger's team conceded a heartbreaking 102nd-minute equalizer in a pulsating climax to Sunday's 1-1 draw with Liverpool. Dutch striker Robin van Persie looked to have given the Gunners all three points, and closed the gap on leaders Manchester United to four points, with a penalty in the eighth minute of injury time at the Emirates Stadium. But with the last kick of the game, Van Persie's compatriot Dirk Kuyt converted a spot-kick for Kenny Dalglish's team to hand the visitors an extraordinary leveler in the 12th minute of time added on. The result left Arsenal six points behind Alex Ferguson's team with only six matches left of the season, ahead of United's trip to Newcastle on Tuesday and the Gunners' London derby at Tottenham the following evening. Referee Andre Marriner allocated eight minutes of stoppage time after Liverpool defender Jamie Carragher received treatment on the field and was subsequently replaced following a clash of heads with young teammate John Flanagan. Liverpool also lost record signing Andy Carroll to a knee injury. Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger was unhappy that play was allowed to continue for so long. ""I feel hard done by in the end because the time was over by three minutes,"" the Frenchman told reporters. ""But you have to take it and you continue to fight. Lucas played in an intelligent way. He stopped his run and the referee saw penalty, but what can you do about it?"" The draw dampened the Anfield club's hopes of playing Europa League football next season. The Merseysiders are four points behind fifth-placed Tottenham, having played two more games than Harry Redknapp's team. Arsenal escaped an early penalty appeal when Swiss defender Johan Djourou tussled with Jay Spearing on his return from a dislocated shoulder, but could have gone ahead after 16 minutes when Laurent Koscielny rattled the crossbar from captain Cesc Fabregas' corner. In a match of few chances, the breakthrough finally arrived for Arsenal deep into injury time when Spearing tripped Fabregas as the Spain midfielder looked to dribble through the Liverpool rearguard. Van Persie stepped up to confidently dispatch the penalty for his 13th league goal of the campaign, sending goalkeeper Pepe Reina the wrong way, but Arsenal's defensive frailty was once again exposed. Uruguay forward Luis Suarez saw his free-kick slam off the wall before Emmanuel Eboue inexplicably shoved Liverpool midfielder Lucas Leiva inside the box as the Brazilian looked to gather the loose ball. Just like his international teammate, Kuyt coolly slotted home to steal a point for Liverpool. Meanwhile, Stoke City will play Manchester City in the FA Cup final after a convincing 5-0 win over fellow Premier League side Bolton Wanderers at London's Wembley Stadium on Sunday. Manchester City end United's treble bid . Stoke have never lifted the FA Cup in their 148-year history, but the four-time semifinalists booked their place in a first-ever final thanks to goals from Matthew Etherington, Robert Huth, Kenwyne Jones and a Jonathan Walters brace. Owen Coyle's Bolton are four-time winners of the knockout competition, but the club's hopes of a first victory since 1958 were extinguished by three first-half goals. Winger Etherington opened the scoring for Tony Pulis' team after 11 minutes when he rifled home a 20-yard shot from Jermaine Pennant's pass. Stoke doubled the lead seven minutes later when Germany defender Huth took advantage of a sloppy clearance from Gary Cahill to find the bottom corner from the edge of penalty area. It was 3-0 to the Staffordshire side after half an hour, when Trinidad and Tobago striker Jones provided a cool finish from another Pennant pass. Republic of Ireland international Walters claimed his first goal after 68 minutes when he ran from inside Stoke's half before curling a wonderful finish beyond Bolton goalkeeper Jussi Jaaskelainen. The rout was complete with nine minutes remaining when Walters scuffed his shot over the veteran Finn from a Jones cross. Stoke will return to England's national stadium on May 14 to face Roberto Mancini's City, who beat archrivals Manchester United 1-0 on Saturday.","Arsenal concede a 102nd-minute equalizer in a 1-1 draw against Liverpool .

"(Mashable)  -- Wikipedia is just the latest in a long line of encyclopedias. In fact, encyclopedias have been around in some form or another for 2,000 years. The oldest, Naturalis Historia, written by Pliny the Elder, is still in existence. How do I know this? I looked it up on Wikipedia, of course. Is it true? Possibly. Ten years after its founding, it's hard to imagine what life was like before Wikipedia. When I was growing up, our family had a dusty set of encyclopedias that were at least 10 years old, which is fine if you're looking up dinosaurs, but not so good if you want to know, for instance, who the current president of the Congo is. But though the limitations of the old encyclopedias were obvious, they were authoritative in ways that Wikipedia is not. Mashable: 9 ways to get more out of Quora . Like most people, I'll take the tradeoff. I have no desire to go back to the days of printed Funk & Wagnalls. If someone would have told me back in 2001 that, within a few years, there would be a comprehensive, free online encyclopedia, I wouldn't have believed them. Why would someone do that? How? Origins . By now, we all know the story: Two Ayn Rand devotees, Jimmy Wales and Larry Sanger, created Wikipedia in January 2001. The founding can be traced to a post by Sanger entitled ""Let's Make a Wiki"" that was intended as a feature to Sanger and Wales's other project, Nupedia. Wiki, Sanger explained in the post, was derived from ""wikiwiki,"" a Polynesian word for ""quick."" ""What it means is a VERY open, VERY publicly editable series of web pages,"" Sanger wrote in the post. As often happens, the feature grew out of proportion with its original intent. Wales, who was originally against the idea of a Wiki, became a strong proponent of it, while Sanger, who became estranged from the project in 2002, now charges that Wales hogged the credit for the venture. Mashable: The future of the social media strategist . (Wales could not be reached for comment. To his credit, Sanger is mentioned as a co-founder on Wikipedia's entry about its founding.) Rooted in open source thinking, Wikipedia contributors began penning a voluminous number of entries (the site claims there are now 17 million such articles), which began showing up in Google searches, furthering the site's growth and notoriety. Meanwhile, a subculture developed around Wikipedia, with self-appointed guardians doing their best to make sure entries were accurate and free of vandalism. As an authoritative 2006 Atlantic article on Wikipedia noted, ""A study by IBM suggests that although vandalism does occur (particularly on high-profile entries like 'George W. Bush'), watchful members of the huge Wikipedia community usually swoop down to stop the malfeasance shortly after it begins."" 'Truth' on the internet . All of this made Wikipedia a pretty good reference, but one that you'd be wise not to take completely at face value. Wikipedia works best as an introduction to a subject. Since the articles usually cite references, readers can investigate further whether the claims are actually true. Despite this, Wikipedia soon earned a reputation for loopy reportage, an aspect best expressed in The Onion headline ""Wikipedia Celebrates 750 Years of American Independence."" Such criticism, though, has it backwards. Wikipedia is, in the best-case scenario, an antidote for the echo chamber of the web. After all, good luck finding ""truth"" on the Internet. Facts may be facts, but they're subject to so much spin that it can be hard to get a handle on what's objectively real. All the more reason why the idea of Wikipedia is laudable, albeit a bit impractical. Though Jimmy Wales could have made a fortune selling ads on the site, he decided to make the Wikimedia Foundation a non-profit charitable organization. Mashable: 6 web pioneers on what the future looks like . But someone has to keep all those servers running and pay those 50 full-time staffers, which is why Wales appeared in a ubiquitous banner ad on Wikipedia asking for donations. The site eventually collected $16 million. The future . Can Wikipedia sustain itself for another 10 years? As The Economist recently pointed out, the number of Wikipedia's English language contributors fell from 54,000 in March 2007 to 35,000 in September 2010, but here Wikipedia may be the victim of its own success. As the site gets more comprehensive, there are fewer entries that need to be written. One thing's for sure -- if Wikipedia ever does go away, it will be hard to believe it. After all, where will we go to confirm such a thing? © 2010 MASHABLE.com. All rights reserved.","Jimmy Wales and Larry Sanger created Wikipedia in January 2001 .

"Washington (CNN) -- Gen. Stanley McChrystal lost his job when Rolling Stone magazine ran an article in which some of his aides made disparaging remarks about the vice president and others. But a newly released investigation by the Department of Defense inspector general finds neither McChrystal nor any of his aides did anything wrong. In the article called ""The Runaway General"" reporter Michael Hastings wrote that one of McChrystal's aides referred to Vice President Joseph Biden as ""Bite Me"" and another referred to then-national security adviser Gen. James Jones as a ""clown."" After interviewing 15 people, the inspector general's office completed its report on April 8. It was made public Monday after a Freedom of Information Act request by the New York Times. Neither McChrystal, who cooperated with an earlier Army investigation, nor Hastings were interviewed for the inspector general's report. In the report, the inspector general writes, ""The evidence was insufficient to substantiate a violation of applicable DoD standards.""

"(CNN) -- Kenyan runner Emmanuel Mutai laid down a marker for the 2012 Olympics by winning his first London Marathon in a course-record time on Sunday. Runner-up in the men's race last year, the 26-year-old came home in two hours four minutes and 40 seconds to eclipse the 2:05.10 set by compatriot Samuel Wanjiru in 2009. He ran the fifth-fastest time in marathon history as he ended the two-year title reign of Martin Lel -- who was more than a minute behind in second place. Lel edged out a third Kenyan, Patrick Makau, in a sprint finish as both clocked 2:05:45. Marathon star Haile Gebrselassie shares his secrets . The African nation tasted further success in the women's race, where Mary Keitany headed off defending champion Liliya Shobukhova of Russia by 56 seconds, while Edna Kiplagat claimed third in her race debut. Mutai, the runner-up at the 2009 World Athletics Championships, said he was delighted to finally win a major event. ""My dreams have come true because I had it in my mind that one day I would win one of the five major marathons,"" he told the UK Press Association. ""I was second here and in New York last year, but today has finally come for me. My aim was just to win, I was not focusing on the time, but I tried my best to push it when I saw we were inside world-record pace at one stage. ""It was fantastic to win the race and improve my personal best."" Marathon mission: Why those final steps are a killer . Keitany is also a major contender for 2012 in the UK capital, having shaved almost 10 minutes off her time in New York a year ago as she came home in 2:19:19 -- the fourth-fastest women's time. The 29-year-old did not have to compete against record-holder Paula Radcliffe, who missed her home race for the second year in a row but will return to action in a 10 kilometer race next month for her first outing since the 2009 New York Marathon. ""I think I surprised myself because I was running with the champion from last year and I was a bit scared,"" Keitany told PA. ""But then I started to believe in myself that I could do it and I feel very happy."" The race attracted more than 35,000 competitors, with British celebrities taking part alongside the general public -- some running for fun and others to raise money for charity. One English couple stopped six miles from the end to get married, PA reported, while there were 34 records recognized by Guinness including fastest times for a super hero, cartoon character and marching band. Meanwhile, Ethiopia's Gebrselassie Tsegaye Reda became the first non-Kenyan in five years to win the Belgrade men's marathon in Serbia on Sunday. He came home in 2:14:41 to head off Kenya's Michael Rutto Chetoo, while Reda's compatriot Tadele Geremew Mulugeta was third. Kenya's Frashiah Nyambura Waithaka won the women's race in 2:34:31.","Kenyans dominate London race with Emmanuel Mutai and Mary Keitany winning .

"Washington (CNN) -- Humanitarian assistance from the United States began its journey to Japan Friday, as President Barack Obama extended a helping hand to the nation after it was hit by a devastating 8.9-magnitude earthquake and ensuing tsunami. There are eight warships either near Japan or headed for it. All are attached to the U.S. 7th Fleet, which is headquartered in Yokosuka, Japan. Navy personnel began loading tons of disaster relief supplies aboard the U.S. 7th Fleet command flagship, the USS Blue Ridge, currently in Singapore The vessel and its crew were scheduled to depart for Japan Saturday morning, according to a statement from U.S. 7th Fleet public affairs. The USS Essex was scheduled to leave Malaysia Friday evening carrying about 2,000 Marines from the 31st Marine Expeditionary movement. The USS Harpers Ferry and the USS Germantown are en route to Japan from the Philippine Sea. The USS Ronald Reagan, a nuclear-powered carrier, has been pulled from a long-planned exercise off the Korean Peninsula and is now headed for the earthquake area, accompanied by USS Chancellorsville and the USS Preble. And the USS Tortuga has left its base at Sasebo, a port city in far southern Japan. The ship already has several landing craft on board, but it's heading to South Korea to take delivery of MH-53 cargo helicopters, which it will then carry to Japan. In addition to the 7th Fleet ships that have already received orders to head to the island nation, all ships in the fleet that can carry helicopters or aircraft have been ordered to be ready to deploy within 24 hours, if necessary. Fleet vessels not designed to carry aircraft must be able to deploy within 48 hours. The fleet is also undertaking a full accounting of all personnel in Japan, as well as the condition of their family members. However, no reports of injuries among 7th Fleet personnel have been received and no major damage has been reported among fleet assets, according to the public affairs statement. The public affairs statement pointed out that the 7th Fleet is not conducting full-scale disaster response operations, which would only come after a formal request from the Japanese government. It's not just the military that is taking steps to get help to victims of Friday's earthquake. The Federal Emergency Management Agency and its partner agencies are on standby in case their assistance is needed, the agency said in a news release. In addition, six Los Angeles County canine disaster search teams have been activated. The dogs were trained by the Search Dog Foundation and are now getting health clearance from their veterinarians to ensure they are ready to deploy. They will be part of a Los Angeles task force mobilized along with one from Virginia by the U.S. Agency for International Development. Each team will come with more than 70 personnel and approximately 75 tons of search and rescue equipment, in addition to the search and rescue dogs. ""On behalf of the American people, I wish to convey our sympathy, thoughts and prayers to the people of Japan who have been affected by this devastating earthquake and tsunami,"" said Rajiv Shah, the administrator for USAID, in a written statement. ""We are working with the government of Japan to provide any assistance needed in the rescue effort as quickly as possible."" The agency also is dispatching a disaster assistance response team. California Gov. Jerry Brown said in a news release that he has ""directed California's Emergency Management Agency to make state resources available to the Japanese government."" Baseball Commissioner Bud Selig even promised assistance from Major League Baseball. Citing ""our shared love of baseball for more than a century,"" Selig said in a statement that Japan is ""a particularly special place to us"" and that MLB will provide aid in the coming days and weeks. The American Red Cross is communicating with the Japanese Red Cross Society and its global partners, according to a statement from the agency. So far, the American Red Cross has not received any requests for blood from its Japanese counterparts, or from the U.S. or Japanese governments. The organization is encouraging people with loved ones in Japan to use the Red Cross ""Safe and Well"" website, an online tool which helps families connect during natural disasters and emergencies. Earlier in the day, Obama described his country's assistance priorities at a news conference. ""I offer our Japanese friends whatever assistance is needed,"" he said. ""Today's events remind us how fragile life can be."" He said the main U.S. assistance to Japan would probably be ""lift capacity"" in the form of heavy equipment to help clean up damaged infrastructure. The U.S. government is taking inventory of how many military personnel are in Japan to provide help, he said, adding that American citizens in Japan will also receive assistance. Obama called the earthquake and tsunami ""a potentially catastrophic disaster,"" saying the images of destruction were ""simply heartbreaking."" At a session of the President's Export Council on Friday morning at the Old Executive Office Building, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton pledged ""immediate disaster relief assistance"" and said, ""We are working closely with the government of Japan to provide additional help,"" according to a State Department statement. The State Department on Friday said there were no immediate reports of casualties among the tens of thousands of U.S. citizens -- tourists, military personnel and others -- in Japan. The State Department issued an alert against nonessential travel to Japan because of the earthquake and tsunami. The alert said that Tokyo airports were closed and others also may be closed or restricted, and that public transportation in Tokyo and other areas has been interrupted. The alert also said strong aftershocks are likely ""for weeks"" and included instructions for what to do if caught in an earthquake or aftershock. It urged U.S. citizens in Japan to contact family and friends to let them know of their well-being. American Airlines told CNN that it would resume flights into Japan on Saturday. Both American and Delta Airlines canceled flights into Tokyo Friday. It was unclear if flights to other Japanese airports also were affected. In addition, Delta, United and Continental airlines announced they were waiving change fees for people whose travel plans involving Japan were affected by the disaster. The Yokota Air Base, a U.S. Air Force facility in Japan, accommodated 11 commercial planes carrying more than 500 passengers, after the flights were diverted to the base when the earthquake closed Tokyo's Narita International Airport, according to a news release from the Air Force's 374th Airlift Wing. Volunteers from various organizations brought food, water and cots for the stranded passengers and helped them register with the Red Cross. At the State Department, Assistant Secretary of State for Consular Affairs Janice Jacobs said a 24-hour consular task force has been set up to help Americans affected by the earthquake. Americans in Japan who need help, or people seeking information about a loved one in Japan, can send an e-mail to japanemergencyusc@state.gov, Jacobs said. Americans outside Japan but in tsunami-affected areas who need help, or people seeking information about an American in affected areas outside Japan, can e-mail pacifictsunamiusc@state.gov, she said. A telephone information line also has been set up at 1-888-407-4747, said Jacobs, who encouraged people to use the e-mail options if possible. When seeking information about Americans in Japan or other affected areas, Jacobs said, people should provide the full name, birth date and location of the person, as well as any pre-existing medical conditions, and if they are elderly or a child.

"(CNN) -- A rural Pennsylvania community will say goodbye Tuesday to seven children who were killed when their parent's farmhouse went up in flames last week. The children -- ages 7 months to 11 years -- died March 8 when the fire fully engulfed the Mennonite family's two-story house in Loysville, about 25 miles northwest of Harrisburg. Their parents were both outside the house at the time of the fire. Mother Janelle Clouse was milking cows in the barn and father Ted Clouse was making deliveries on his milk route. ""While mom's milking cows, her 3-year-old daughter comes running into the barn and the 3-year-old tells the mother that there's smoke inside the house,"" Tom Pinkerton of the state police said last week. ""Mom leaves the barn, comes running out, sees that the house appears to be on fire."" The mother went to two neighbors' houses before she could get someone to call 911, he said. She then found her husband sleeping in his milk truck and they rushed back to the home to find their home engulfed in flames and firefighters trying to put out the blaze. The children -- six girls and a boy -- were found dead inside the house. The 3-year-old was the only child who survived. The funeral is scheduled for the Perry Mennonite Reception Center in Elliottsburg. Burial will be at the Church of the Living Christ cemetery. The fire sent shock waves through the central Pennsylvania community. ""It's just hard to explain how somebody could lose their whole family in a wink of an eye like that,"" Steve Orris, who works at an insurance company in Loysville, said last week. ""It's just unbelievable."" ""Everybody I've talked to here ... has felt a lot of sympathy toward these people. It's a real shame the way things like that happen,"" he said.","The funeral is scheduled for the Perry Mennonite Reception Center in Elliottsburg .

"Port-Au-Prince, Haiti (CNN) -- Snubbing the United States, former Haitian President Jean-Bertrand Aristide returned home from exile Friday, just ahead of a critical runoff election. Aristide spoke briefly after landing at Toussaint L'Overture Airport in Port-au-Prince but made no direct reference to Sunday's vote. He alluded, however, to the exclusion of his own party, Fanmi Lavalas, banned from participating in the election. ""Today the Haitian people mark the end of exile and coup d'etats while  peacefully we must move from social exclusion to social inclusion,"" Aristide said in the airport's diplomatic lounge. Speaking in Creole, French and several other languages, Aristide, 57, said he condemned the violence that has wracked his nation since the disputed late November presidential election. Aristide, a polarizing figure in Haiti, became the second former president to return to Port-au-Prince this year. Dictator Jean-Claude ""Baby Doc"" Duvalier flew back from France unexpectedly in January. Aristide made his way from the airport to his former home in the neighborhood of Tabarre, which was recently fixed up and painted in anticipation of his return. Haitians waved flags, danced and chanted his name along the road leading to his house. They carried signs that said ""Titid,"" Aristide's nickname, and sported T-shirts with his picture and slogans supporting his  return. ""He  could be the king of Haiti. He is a president we love so much,"" said Willy Joseph, a 48-year-old mason who waited outside Aristide's house to catch a glimpse of the former president. Raoul Jean Cetoute, a 66-year-old carpenter, said he would refrain from the visiting the polls Sunday. ""I'm not going to vote in  this masquerade election. We'll listen and analyze what (Aristide) says to know what to  do,"" he said. The former Roman Catholic priest and Haiti's first democratically elected president chose to go back at a tense time. Haitians, still reeling from last year's devastating earthquake and a cholera epidemic, are set to choose a new leader Sunday. Many, including the Obama administration, have questioned Aristide's timing and said his presence would disrupt the vote. Aristide's chartered jet took off Thursday night from Johannesburg, South Africa, where he had been living for the past seven years, and landed shortly after 10 a.m. in the Haitian capital. He was accompanied by his wife, Mildred; U.S. actor and longtime supporter Danny Glover; and U.S. attorney Ira Kurzban. Also traveling with Aristide was Amy Goodman, host of the news program ""Democracy Now!"" At a refueling stop in Dakar, Senegal, Aristide told Goodman that he believes the Haitian people were happy to see him return. ""I think that the Haitian people are very happy, happy to know that we are on our way heading to Haiti, happy to know that finally their dream will be fulfilled by things on the ground because they fought hard for democracy,"" Aristide said. ""I share their happiness, I share their hope, and I renew my commitment to serve them in the field of education, once we move together"" toward such a goal, he said. The White House, however, was less than thrilled by Aristide's return, warning this week that it would prove destabilizing. State Department spokesman Mark Toner said Monday that Aristide seeks to influence the election. ""Mr. Aristide has chosen to remain outside of Haiti for seven years,"" Toner said. ""To return this week can only be seen as a conscious choice to impact Haiti's elections."" Kurzban said Aristide plans to get involved with educational projects and teach. He wanted to return before Sunday's election, Kurzban said, because he had ""genuine concerns that the next president may take a different view"" and not allow Aristide to return. ""It is not to be involved in the elections, as the United States suggests,"" Kurzban said. A group of prominent U.S. lawyers sent a letter Thursday to Cheryl Mills, chief of staff at the State Department, objecting to what they said was American interference with Aristide's ""constitutional and human right to return."" ""The United States trying to control when any Haitian citizen -- especially a former president -- can enter Haiti is outrageous,"" said Bill Quigley, a New Orleans law professor and legal director of the Center for Constitutional Rights. ""It violates a stack of binding international human rights treaties,"" he said. ""I felt compelled to speak out to defend both President Aristide's human rights and the American tradition of rule of law that I teach in my classroom."" Aristide was shuttled out of Haiti in 2004 on a U.S. plane after bloodshed on the streets and charges of authoritarianism and corruption. His supporters, including Glover, say the White House wants to keep Aristide out of Haiti in favor of a leader more in line with its own views. ""I am going to South Africa to show our solidarity with the people of Haiti by standing at the side of the leader they elected twice with overwhelming support: President Jean-Bertrand Aristide,"" Glover said in a statement. ""People of good conscience cannot be idle while a former dictator is able to return unhindered while a democratic leader who peacefully handed over power to another elected president is restricted from returning to his country by external forces,"" Glover said, referring to Duvalier, who fled into exile in France in 1986 after 15 years of iron-fisted rule. Duvalier stunned the world by returning to Haiti in January. Shortly afterward, Aristide again aired his desire to go back home. The Haitian government issued him a new passport last month. Aristide retains a following in Haiti, especially among the poorest of the poor, who catapulted him to power in 1990 with more than 67 percent of the vote. But Aristide's relationship with his homeland, as well as the international community, has been a complicated one. He gained popularity in Haiti by giving the poor and disenfranchised a voice, but his critics accused him of corruption, greed and human rights abuses -- problems that have plagued the impoverished Caribbean nation under other leaders as well. Last year, a massive earthquake devastated Haiti. Recovery efforts have been slow and have added to electoral turmoil. The United Nations voiced concerns this week over violence marring the campaign and called on ""all candidates, especially those in the presidential runoff, to avoid threats, intimidation and harassment."" ""Consolidation of democracy in Haiti depends largely on the will of politicians to adopt the principles of a peaceful transfer of power and to accept election results in accordance with mechanisms provided by the electoral law,"" said a statement from the U.N. Stabilization Mission in Haiti, which has been in Haiti since Aristide's departure. The presidential vote pits former first lady Mirlande Manigat against popular musician Michel Martelly in a runoff that was delayed by two months because of unrest and charges of fraud. Both candidates had said earlier they support a Haitian citizen's right to return home. Martelly, considered the frontrunner in the race, had no comment on Aristide's return, spokesman Damian Merlo said. CNN's Moni Basu in Atlanta and journalist Allyn Gaestel in Port-au-Prince contributed to this report.","Aristide's chartered jet lands in Port-au-Prince shortly after 10 a.m.

"(CNN) -- The Italian and French governments were both trying to defuse an escalating diplomatic row Monday after France refused entry to a train carrying North African migrants from Italy. Italy complained to France on Sunday after authorities blocked a train with Tunisian migrants from the border city of Ventimiglia entering Menton on the Cote d'Azur. The Tunisians had been issued resident permits by Italy, allowing them to travel freely in many European countries. French Interior Minister Claude Gueant said Monday in Bucharest that France did not want any continuing tensions with Rome regarding the train incident. Gueant said Rome's decision to give temporary resident permits to more than  25,000 Tunisian migrants arriving in Italy since January had been ""heavily contested by many countries in the European Union."" Some 300 French and Italian protestors from a group named ""Train for dignity,"" were also aboard the train in a show of support for the 60 Tunisians who were hoping to enter France. Gueant said that although France accepted this decision, there were conditions - namely that the migrants had to prove they could support themselves financially. Since the mass political unrest started in North Africa and other Arab states in January, a large number people have fled Tunisia and Libya to Europe, where governments have been trying to prevent a refugee crisis. Italy's coast guard said at least 1,623 migrants landed on the island of Lampedusa over a 24-hour period in mid-March alone. Italy's foreign minister has estimated that as many as 300,000 Libyans could try to leave and could potentially end up in his country. Medecins Sans Frontieres said Saturday that it had evacuated nearly 100 people by boat from Misrata in Libya and on Monday the UK Department for International Development (DFID) said that it would help 5,000 migrants trapped by fighting in western Libya. The DFID said £1.5 million ($2.43 million) would be made available to charter ships to get people out of the rebel-held town of Misrata and transfer them to Benghazi. Andrew Mitchell, the UK International Development Secretary, said his department would help fund their evacuation in ships chartered by the International Organization for Migration, which says the majority of unauthorized immigrants arriving in Lampedusa are Tunisian. Italy for its part has issued temporary resident permits to thousands of Tunisian migrants and the country on Sunday said it was angered after trains were stopped at the border for around six hours until traffic resumed later that evening. However, at a briefing with journalists Monday, a spokesman for the Italian Foreign Minister Maurizio Massari, tried to play down the issue: ""The situation was clarified and the incident resolved yesterday (Sunday). On the immigration issue, there is a continuous dialogue taking place between the Interior Ministers of the two countries to deal with the problem. We are working together. There is no tension. We are working together to find steps to take to solve the immigration problem.' According to a spokesman for the French Interior Ministry the border was never closed but circulation was ""temporarily halted in order to avoid any risk of an accident,"" because of an unauthorized protest in support of the Tunisian migrants. Claude Gueant insisted that France had respected the Schengen agreements to the letter and a first analysis by the European commission on Monday showed that France's decision to stop the trains was in line with the Schengen rules. The Schengen agreement allows people to travel between 25 European countries without the need of a passport. CNN's Saskya Vandoorne, Hada Messia and Thair Shaikh contributed to this report.","France refused entry to a train carrying North African migrants from Italy .

"(CNN) -- What would truly delight the geek in your life? It's nearly impossible to know if you don't share his or her peculiar tastes. It's not good enough just to get them a Rubik's Cube or copy of ""The Hobbit."" (You know they could solve a Rubik's Cube by the time they were 7, and they already own the complete collection of Tolkien in hardback.) Show them you care by learning about the things they like and demonstrating that knowledge with your gift choice. Start by determining what the geek in your life is obsessed with. Geeks are passionate about niche interests, and a little digging on your part is sure to result in a wide-eyed, bouncy, emphatic ""thank you!"" when it's time to open presents. Once you have a good idea, look to niche, online shopping destinations such as ThinkGeek, Big Bad Toy Store, Nichibei, EA, SteamPowered and The Space Store. ""We sell what we think is cool,"" Shane Peterman of ThinkGeek said. ""Everyone here, all the product buyers, we're all geeks. So we have a pretty good handle on what we think would work."" Peterman said that sci-fi and fantasy-related merchandise always sells well for ThinkGeek, including anything having to do with franchises such as ""Star Wars,"" ""Star Trek,"" ""Doctor Who"" and ""Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy."" You can also find plenty of geeky merchandise on broader sites such as Amazon or Best Buy. Too late for shipping? Head for a comic book store, where you can generally find figurines, collectable action figures and specialized merchandise as well as comic books, graphic novels, DVDs and manga. To find the comic book store nearest you, go to comicshoplocator.com. Or check out a hobby shop, which may have a room dedicated to games. Also go to gaming stores or bookstores. Bookstores such as Barnes & Noble or Borders have gaming books, comics and manga as well. Geek merchandise can be confusing for a gift-giver who doesn't know what ""Neon Genesis Evangelion"" is. (It's a popular Japanese franchise about a group of teenagers who pilot robot-like vehicles in an apocalyptic war against ""Angels."") That's why CNN.com's Geek Out! team collaborated with experts to compile a list of gift suggestions for the geeks in your life. But geeks are not one-size-fits-all, and our gift suggestions might not be right for your situation. If you can't find the specific thing the geek in your life likes, ask for help in a bookstore or comic shop. There's usually one go-to geek on staff who can assist, pointing out suitable gifts within the genre. For example, if the comic book geek in your life has a good relationship with the local comic shop purveyor, they might have an established wish list of comic books from certain authors or artists. Fans of some sci-fi or fantasy television shows may also be part of the comic book fan culture, since many shows, such as ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer,"" ""True Blood,"" ""The Walking Dead"" and ""Firefly,"" continue and develop story lines in comic book format. Volumes collecting six-issue (or more) storylines are a growing phenomenon in the comic book world, so these would certainly be a big hit with the comic book geek in your life. ""Japanophile"" geeks crave stories and characters that are different from American comic books and animation, said Colette Bennett, editor-in-chief of Tomopop.com, a blog about Japanese toys, collectibles and fan culture. ""From Japan's obsession with over-the-top romance to the emphasis on always ""doing your best"" and working hard, there's something about [Japanese entertainment] that really makes you feel good,"" Bennett said. That's why these geeks turn to manga, a Japanese take on the comic book format, and anime, animated series and movies often based on the story lines in manga. Titans in anime include filmmakers Hayao Miyazaki, often called the ""Walt Disney of Japan,"" and Katsuhiro Otomo, who created the groundbreaking 1988 film ""Akira."" While ""Star Trek"" and ""Star Wars"" have long defined what a passionate, sci-fi geek is all about, other established franchises such as ""Doctor Who"" and ""Battlestar Galactica"" and newer shows such as ""Fringe"" also have large, passionate fan bases. It's critical to establish which character, space ship or story line the sci-fi geek is interested in. If your geek likes ""Star Wars,"" don't assume that anything ""Star Wars""-related will do. Keep in mind there may be several iterations of the sci-fi franchise. Starwars.com and startrek.com include information about their different incarnations. The mainstreaming of some fantasy franchises certainly makes shopping for a fantasy geek easy, since merchandise is widely available. You'd have to be pretty out of touch not to be aware of characters and plot from ""The Lord of the Rings"" or ""Harry Potter,"" given the popularity of the books and movies in the past decade. ""We love to love the good guys and love to hate the bad guys. With the added factor of magic and/or futuristic technology thrown in, anything is possible,"" said Pat Dawson, a senior staffer of TheOneRing.net, a Tolkien fan site. See TheOneRing.net's Tolkien gift guide . Gamer geeks may prefer retro selections like the Atari and Nintendo games from arcades. Others could be into first-person shooter games or strategy games. Gamers aren't limited to computer or console games -- tabletop games such as Dungeons & Dragons capitalize on imagination and a role-playing penchant. Most gamers like to stay on the cutting edge of titles and tech. So if a game came out in November, it is likely they already have it. But downloadable content -- content that adds to games after they are released -- and add-ons that make game-play faster will be appreciated gifts. Of course, gift cards for game shops and outlets are the easiest way to please a gamer because they can choose exactly what they want. Just don't be alarmed when you hear, ""Thanks for 'Slaughter Fest 2010,' Grandma!"" Shopping for an astronomy geek can be tough. They're not a one-star-fits-all kind of crowd, explained Brittney Dempsey, office manager for NASA's online Space Store. There are star geeks who like memorizing constellations and myths, NASA lovers who obsess over space travel and physics geeks who love stargazing and mapping. Before you pick a gift, make sure you know which kind of space geek you're dealing with. Piece of advice: Space geeks are not necessarily ""Star Trek"" or ""Star Wars"" geeks. If you assume they are, be prepared -- your space geek will be quick to point out the differences between the reality that interests them and science fiction. Henry Hanks, Jamie Gumbrecht and Larry Frum contributed to this report.","Shop for geeks by going niche; a little homework will go a long way .
