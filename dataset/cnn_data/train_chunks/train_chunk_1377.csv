"The Tories have opened up a clear lead over Labour when voters are forced to choose between the two parties, a new poll shows. Some 41 per cent of voters would prefer a Conservative government led by David Cameron, while only 36 per cent favour Ed Miliband leading a Labour administration. With 101 days until the election, pollsters say ‘many voters have lost faith in Labour’ but they have not yet been convinced by the Tories, with 42 per cent believing they are still the 'nasty party'. Scroll down for video . The Tories have opened up a five-point lead over Labour when voters are forced to choose between the two parties, but the gap is driven by falling enthusiasm for Ed Miliband taking power . A Ford Capri - seen by voters as the car version of Nigel Farage . Nigel Farage is seen by voters as a Ford Capri – carrying a ‘shiny exterior’ to cover a dodgy engine under the bonnet, new polling has revealed. When asked to say which car the main party leaders would be voters named the retro car or a ‘four-by-four with illegal bull bars on the front’. David Cameron, meanwhile, is seen as ‘something smooth’ like a Mercedes or a Range Rover, according to focus groups quizzed by the Tory peer Lord Ashcroft. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg was seen as a Smart car – or a people carrier, carrying round everybody else’s baggage. Ed Miliband was more difficult to pin down. One voter said he was a Ford Focus – because he was ‘average’, but changed their mind because the ‘a Ford Focus is reliable’. Mr Cameron used a speech in Southampton today to set out the ‘moral and practical’ case for cutting taxes. He hopes to contrast Conservative policies on tax, welfare and growth with Labour’s lack of trust on the economy. But the Prime Minister has yet to persuade voters that he has their best interest at heart. Detailed polling shows more than two-thirds of voters think Mr Cameron ‘doesn’t understand the lives of people like me’, that the Conservative party cares ‘more about the rich and affluent than ordinary people’ and that the Tory party ‘contains many people with bigoted and intolerant views’. Almost half - 46 per cent say – Mr Cameron has ‘no clear principles’, and 42 per cent think the Conservatives are still the ‘nasty party’. However, 48 per cent say the Tories will take ‘tough but necessary’ decisions. Meanwhile, Mr Cameron's personal net satisfaction rating has improved markedly in recent weeks, up to 7 per cent, while Mr Miliband's has tumbled to minus 50. The five-point lead on the ‘forced question’ of who voters would prefer in power is the highest in a YouGov/Prospect survey for two years. At the same time, Labour is three points ahead when voters are asked who they intend to vote for, with the views of those planning to support smaller parties likely to decide the outcome of the election. On the forced question, Ukip supporters back the Tories over Labour by 50 per cent to 18. You’Gov’s Peter Kelner said: ‘Doubtless, the Tories feel frustrated that so many of their past supporters have moved to Ukip. ‘However, our figures suggest that the Tories may be able to win many of them back in the key marginals by stressing their message, “vote Farage, get Miliband”.’ Support for a Tory government with Mr Cameron at the helm has remained steady at 40 or 41 per cent for the last two years. David Cameron's personal net satisfaction has improved markedly in recent weeks, despite two thirds of voters thinking he 'doesn’t understand the lives of people like me' David Cameron and George Osborne, pictured today, helping to make cider at Hecks Cider Farm in Street, Somerset . Labour leader Ed Miliband, pictured today, visiting to the George Eliot Hospital in Nuneaton . 69% David Cameron doesn’t understand the lives of people like me . 46% David Cameron has no clear principles . 69% The Conservatives care more about the rich and affluent than ordinary people . 63% Underneath the surface the Conservative party contains many people with bigoted and intolerant views . 67% The Conservatives are too close to big business and the banks . 48% The Conservatives are prepared to make the tough but necessary decisions the country needs . 34% The Conservative party have changed for the better since their time in opposition . 25% The Conservative party cares about helping all groups in society, not just the few . 42% It is true today that the Conservatives are the 'nasty party' The increase in the Tory lead is a result of falling enthusiasm for a Labour government. ‘Miliband’s reputation and Labour’s support have declined, but Cameron’s and the Conservatives’ figures have not improved,’ Mr Kellner writes in Prospect magazine. ‘In short, many voters have lost faith in Labour but not transferred their affections to the Tories.’ There was renewed speculation at the weekend that the SNP could prop up a minority Labour administration. SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon suggested it would be better for the whole of Britain if Nationalists were sitting in a Miliband Cabinet. Mr Cameron said the remarks were further evidence of the need for a Tory government. Speaking in Southampton, he said: 'If there was anyone who thought the worst possible outcome of the election was an Ed Miliband-led Labour government, actually I can now tell you something that would be even worse, and that is Ed Miliband in Downing Street, supported by the Scottish National Party who want to break up our United Kingdom. ‘The battle of this election has become even more important.' However, Mr Kellner said cautioned that this approach will not be enough to secure an overall majority for the Conservatives. ‘Frightening Ukip supporters with the nightmare of a Miliband government could help the Tories remain ahead of Labour – but won’t be enough to reach the 326 seats needed for an overall majority in the new House of Commons.’","41% want Tory government with Cameron, 36% want Labour with Miliband .

"A 17st 12lbs dad who was so shocked by a photo of him and his son that he embarked on a weight-loss journey to set a healthier example to his children has won a national slimming award. David Eyres, from Oldham, didn't recognise the man he saw in the picture, which was taken on Christmas Eve 2013, and he became determined to lose weight. The self-employed landscape gardener had been overweight for years and things got worse when he turned to food for comfort after the death of his father in 2009. David was horrified after realising he could barely recognise himself in this Christmas snap with his son Ben (left), he recreated it a year later having lost weight . David, who has been crowned 'Mr Sleek' by slimming world, now proudly holds up his old pyjama bottoms having lost an impressive four stone . The dad-of-three joined his local Slimming World group with his wife Kelly, 35, in January 2014. Now just more than one year on he's four-and-a-half stone lighter and been named Slimming World's Mr Sleek 2015. The 34-year-old is the slimming club's first ever winner of the competition, which recognises the male slimmer who has undergone the greatest transformation inside and out. He said: 'I've been overweight for more than a decade, so it's amazing to me to think that anyone would describe me as ""sleek"". 'My youngest son Max, who's four, loves telling everyone that his daddy doesn't have a big belly anymore though - my kids are my biggest supporters.' David said his eating habits became such a problem that he would often eat in secret while he was at work. He tried lots of diets without success before Kelly suggested they join Slimming World together. David lost weight due to a combination of exercise and making healthy meal choices . David's wife Kelly, left, also joined Slimming World and lost and impressive five stone herself . David said: 'I would get out of breath easily, even just climbing the stairs in our house, so I didn't really play games or sports with the kids and I worried I was setting a bad example to them. 'I tried to put it to the back of my mind but when I saw the photo of me and my eldest son Ben, who was eight at the time, I knew I needed to do something. Name: David Eyres . Age: 34 . Height: 6ft/1.83m . Starting weight: 17st 12lbs/250lbs/114kg . Current weight: 13st 5lbs/187lbs/85kg . Weight loss: 4st 7lbs/63lbs/29kg . Starting waist measurement: 38in . Current weight measurement: 30in . 'I was the heaviest I'd ever been and my confidence level was pretty much zero. That photograph was a real wake-up call.' David said although he was nervous about joining the group he knew it was the right thing to do: 'I was worried about being the only man at Slimming World and thought I'd stick out like a sore thumb, so I was really glad I had Kelly with me on that first night. 'The Consultant Michaela was so welcoming though and within a couple of weeks my nerves had disappeared. 'I started to look forward to going to Slimming World each week, of course because I wanted to know how much weight I'd lost but I wanted to see how everyone else had got on too.' David followed the group's healthy eating plan and quickly began to see the results. In his first week David lost 3.5lbs and within five months he'd reached his first target, losing 4st 1lb. He's since lost another 6lbs to reach a total weight loss of 4st 7lbs, going from 17st 12lbs to 13st 5lbs, and dropped 8in from his waist. David says: 'I couldn't believe the change in me in just a few months. I'm quite competitive and I loved collecting the awards that you get for every 7lbs you lose. 'They made me want to keep going for the next milestone and I've got all the certificates stuck to our fridge.' Kelly and David have lost an impressive nine and a half stone between them in the last year . David says that one of the best things about losing weight is that his children are really proud of him . David said the group helped him to completely overhaul his diet: 'We were always a 'jar family' using pre-prepared sauces and convenience foods and we had a lot of takeaways - sometimes four or five times a week - just because it was easy. 'But we started cooking from scratch and now the whole family eats the same meals. We love homemade curries, they taste just like the takeaways we used to have but obviously they're a lot better for you.' David's fitness has improved too. He no longer gets out of breath and has more energy: 'Work is a lot easier now and I've joined a gym. 'Best of all, I can run around with the kids and practice rugby with Ben at the park - I've gone from feeling like a failed parent to feeling like a proud dad.' Before embarking on his weight loss plan, David would think nothing of wolfing down hearty meals . Kelly has also found success with Slimming World, having lost around 5st. David says: 'I couldn't believe it when I found out I'd won the title of Mr Sleek and Kelly was over the moon for me, especially because she knew she'd get to see me in a suit for the first time in years. 'We're both so proud of each other - it's amazing to think we've lost nearly 10st between us in a year - and I'm so glad we've done this together. 'I hope my story will show people, especially other men, that losing weight doesn't have to be hard and it really is possible to make your New Year's resolutions come true. 'This Christmas Eve Ben and I recreated the photo that made me want to start losing weight, I looked like a different bloke - and I feel like one too.' Breakfast: . Nothing . Mid-morning: . A bacon sandwich on white bread . Lunch: . Big Mac, fries and coke with a double cheeseburger. Then two Snickers bars and a packet of crisps in the afternoon . Dinner: .

"Barack Obama has been accused of being disrespectful after being caught chewing gum during the Republic Day parade in India. A photo of the President removing the gum from his mouth before popping it back in, has been shared across Twitter. At the time, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi appears to be trying to explain something to the president. 'In an ungainly sight, cameras caught US President Brack Obama chewing gum during the Republic Day parade on Monday.

Scroll down for video . U.S. President Barack Obama has been accused of being disrespectful, after being caught chewing gum during the Republic Day parade in India . Twitter user Shobhaa De was critical of the president saying 'seriously - gum during a formal parade'. White House Correspondent Peter Baker speculated that Obama was most probably chewing Nicorette . Twitter user Shobhaa De wrote: 'Barack bhai working his jaws overtime and chewing gum! At least it's isn't gutka. But seriously - gum during a formal parade?' American media speculated that Mr Obama was most probably chewing Nicorette. Peter Baker, a White House correspondent, tweeted, 'Obama appears to be enjoying parade, shown on Indian television bobbing his head with the music. Seems to be chewing gum, probably Nicorette.' David B Cohen tweeted: 'That's his 21-gum salute RT @Vamsee9002: Just now saw Prez Obama chewing something.' In November The Washington Post reported that Mr Obama was using the Nicorette to try and beat his cigarette cravings. Its report said: 'For Obama, gum isn't about vanity' and said his aides had described the president's quest to kick cigarettes as a 'lifelong struggle'. This isn't the first time Obama has been caught chewing gum. He was lambasted on social media for doing so at the APEC summit in Beijing and at a Second World War ceremony in France.

Along with first lady Michelle Obama, the president was greeted with rapturous applause as he joined the parade in New Delhi as part of a three-day visit to India aimed at strengthening relations .

Along with first lady Michelle Obama, the president was greeted with rapturous applause as he joined the parade in New Delhi as part of a three-day visit to India. The visit is aimed at strengthening a relationship between the world's largest democracies that has at times been fraught with tension and suspicion. Mr Obama's attendance at the Republic Day celebrations was unlike any other event he has participated in during his overseas travel as president. He spent about two hours on an outdoor viewing platform, an unusual amount of time given Secret Service security concerns. Mr Obama nodded in approval as Indian tanks and rocket launchers, some of them Russian-made, rolled down the parade route and air force jets sped by overhead.

"Susan Crockett escaped death by climbing out the window of her house in Palm Coast, Florida . A woman who lost her home and severely injured her shoulder during a plane crash that killed three people has filed a claim against the Federal Aviation Administration. Susan Crockett was at her home in Palm Coast, Florida, when a four-seat 1957 Beechcraft H35 Bonanza crashed into it on Jan. 4, 2013. The plane was headed to  Knoxville, Tennessee, but was attempting to make an emergency landing at Flagler County Airport. Crockett was able to escape through a window at her home moments after the plane crashed, but pilot Michael Anders, 58, and passengers Duane Shaw, 59 and Charissee Peoples, 42, were killed. It was Anders' birthday and Shaw and Peoples were engaged to be married. Crockett lost her home because it was deemed 'uninhabitable' and torn down. She was also forced to undergo surgery on her shoulder after injuring it during her escape. Anders did not have insurance at the time of the crash, so Crockett has been paying medical bills and other 'significant expenses' herself. She filed the claim because there is no federal or state requirement for small private planes to carry insurance and believes the FAA should implement a policy requiring pilots to be insured against accidents. Scroll down for video . Firefighters battling the blaze at Susan Crockett's home after the plane crashed into it in January 2013 . The crash claimed the lives of three people: Michael Anders, 58, Duane Shaw, 59 and Charissee Peoples, 42 . The claim also states Crockett has been suffering from 'the psychological aftermath of the trauma', according to WESH. It's unclear how much Crockett is seeking in damages. She said: 'It seems like this is what I have to do to get someone to listen: bring a lawsuit. 'No one should have to go through what I went through — to have your life destroyed and no one is accountable for that.' A review by the National Transportation Safety Board found that both Anders and air traffic controllers were partly responsible for the crash, another factor that prompted Crockett and her attorney, Marc Dwyer, to file the claim, the Palm Coast Observer reported. The government has six months to analyze the claim before the case could potentially be heard in a federal court. A 1957 Beechcraft H35 Bonanza that is very similar to the one which was being piloted by Anders . Crockett's home was deemed 'uninhabitable' after the crash, one of the factors which prompted the claim . Dwyer said: 'If it becomes a court case... either a judge or jury will decide what percentage of the blame air traffic control is assigned, and they would be responsible for that share. 'The only way I can force the government to make changes to the current regulations is to file a claim against them. 'We want to see some change. I think it's clearly obvious that the pilot played a major role in it, and he will pay no role in covering Mrs. Crockett's damages.'

"The United States is closing its embassy in Yemen to the public until further notice amid political turmoil after the country's government resigned under pressure from a rebel movement. The decision was made 'out of an abundance of caution and care for our employees and others who may be visiting the embassy,' a statement issued by the embassy said. 'Due to the recent resignation of the Yemeni president, prime minister, and cabinet, and the ongoing security concerns, the US embassy in Sanaa is unable to provide routine consular services and will have very limited ability to assist with emergency cases involving US citizens.'

Yemen's powerful Shiite militia blocked access to Sanaa University on Monday as opponents to their takeover of the capital called for more demonstrations against their tightening grip. Washington is now deprived of a staunch ally in its . campaign against al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP). U.S. President Barack Obama insisted Sunday that his administration would pursue its efforts against al Qaeda in Yemen regardless of upheaval that led Hadi to tender his resignation along with Prime Minister Khalid Bahah. The decision to close the embassy in Yemen was issued only hours after a drone strike reportedly killed three al Qaeda suspects in an eastern desert area of Yemen. The United States is the only country operating the unmanned aircraft in the region. Yemen's parliament has so far postponed a session to consider Hadi's resignation, raising fears of a prolonged power vacuum after a Shiite militia kidnapped his chief of staff and seized key buildings across the capital Sanaa. The State Department today warned U.S. citizens 'of the high security threat level' in the country 'due to terrorist activities and civil unrest' and urged them 'not to travel to Yemen.' 'US citizens still in Yemen should make plans to depart immediately,' the embassy said. Protesters hold a poster depicting Yemen's President Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi, left, and Abdul-Malik al-Houthi, a leader of Shiite rebels who hold the capital, amid a power vacuum, during a demonstration in Sanaa on Saturday.

"Greek singer Demis Roussos, pictured in 2012, who has died aged 68 in an Athens Hospital following an undisclosed illness . Greek singer Demis Roussos famed for his hits in the seventies and eighties has died aged 68 after suffering from an undisclosed illness. The Egyptian-born performer saw his popularity rise in the 1960s and 70s after joining progressive rock group Aphrodite's Child. He was best-known for his hits Forever And Ever and Goodbye as well as providing the soundtrack to the 1977 TV play Abigail's Party. He sold 60 million records worldwide. Mr Roussos was born in 1946 in Alexandria, Egypt as Artemios Ventouris Roussos to a Greek father and an Egyptian mother of Italian origin. The family fled to Greece after losing all their possessions during the Suez crisis. Aged 17, he began his music career joining a band called The Idols, where he met his future Aphrodite's Child band mates. Aphrodite's Child made three hit albums, which enjoyed success across Europe in the late 1960s. Mr Roussos then went on to enjoy a solo career in the 1970s, with his song Forever And Ever topping the UK charts in 1976. His other hits included My Friend the Wind, My Reason, Happy To Be On An Island In The Sun and Someday Somewhere. He made one of his earliest appearances on English-language TV on the Basil Brush Show and became known as the 'Kaftan King' following his fondness for the garments. He was also a regular target for parody, with comics including Freddie Starr and The Grumbleweeds taking aim at him, but was immortalised for many in the Mike Leigh TV play Abigail's Party. The scene where Alison Steadman's character's expressed her devotion to Roussos who she says 'doesn't sound' fat is regularly replayed.

He topped the UK charts in 1976 with his song Forever and Ever . Roussos, who died in Athens, said his success in the UK was down to the rise of foreign holidays. He told The Scotsman: 'The reason for my big success in England was the Brits - they started wanting to go on holidays, like Spain and Greece. 'My music came right on time. It was romantic Mediterranean music addressed to all the people who wanted to go on holiday. My music was liked by the people.' In 1985, the singer was caught up in a plane hijacking when flight TWA 847 from Athens to Rome was hijacked by members of Hezbollah and Islamic Jihad. He and his third wife were held as prisoners in Beirut for five days before they were released. Mr Roussos has struggled with he weight throughout his life and co-wrote a book about obesity .

"It's a sticky issue that has plagued scientists – and breakfast tables – for decades. But now researchers claim to have found the definitive answer as to why a piece of toast always seems to fall buttered side down. Apparently, it’s all to do with the height of the table. They claim that after it topples off the edge, the toast only has time to perform a half-somersault before it lands. Scientists say toast falls butter side down because it only has time to rotate half a somersault before landing . As the side which has been buttered is naturally facing upwards, that’s the side which ends up on the floor. To confirm the theory, food expert Professor Chris Smith and his team dropped 100 slices of toast from a table at Manchester MET University. The table was two and a half feet high. In 81 per cent of cases, the buttered side made contact with the floor. The research was commissioned to mark the DVD release of the latest series of The Big Bang Theory, a US comedy about a group of socially awkward physicists. ‘The question of whether the toast does indeed always land buttered side down is exactly the kind of quandary that would keep the characters in Big Bang Theory awake at night,’ said Professor Smith. ‘Our research shows that Sod’s Law really does exist when it comes to dropped toast. Researchers from Manchester MET University dropped 100 slices of buttered toast to test their theory . ‘The upshot is that if you want to ensure your toast lands butter side up then you should invest in a higher table approximately 8ft high that allows the toast to rotate a full 360 degrees. Failing that – try not to drop the toast.’ While the crucial element is the height of the table, which affects the time the toast takes to fall, the physics of the slice of toast itself also have an effect. The air pockets in a slice of bread create drag as it falls. But buttering one side of the bread changes that surface, altering the level of drag and changing the way it rotates as it falls. The phenomenon has baffled scientists and the public alike for almost 180 years. It was discussed as long ago as 1835, in the New York Monthly Magazine. Of course, the problem only occurs if you can spread the butter in the first place. A recent survey of 3,000 people found their biggest breakfast bugbear was ruining a slice of toast by trying to spread butter that was too cold. But designers came up with a solution – a heated knife to warm the butter, which baker Warburtons hopes to produce.","Scientists said toast only has time to rotate half a somersault before landing .

"A woman angry at cuts being made to council services has decided to take matters into her own hands, by employing a handywoman to do jobs in the area. Former Dragon's Den contestant Ling Valentine, 41, has employed Clare Honey, 40, on a £16,000 salary to do 'absolutely anything that needs doing in the community' after council cuts hit local services in Grange Villa in County Durham. Mrs Valentine pays the wages herself. Ms Honey, a former carer, also has her own motorised buggy provided by Mrs Valentine, and carries out any jobs local residents need including clearing rubbish, cutting hedges and going on patrol to find where street lights need replacing and the elderly need help. Ling Valentine (centre) has employed Clare Honey (left) on a £16,000 salary as a handywoman for Grange Villa in County Durham, after she felt council cuts were hitting services in the community. Ms Honey clears rubbish and trims hedges and the pair have put up 'welcome' signs to show people they care about the village . The scheme has been so successful Ms Honey has won the backing of Durham Police for her help to clear up the local community and make people feel safe and proud of their area. Mrs Valentine, a businesswoman who runs a car leasing firm, decided to place an advert for a handyman or woman to help clear up the community after she fell victim to a string of thefts and was told there were few resources to sort out the village. She said: 'Back in September last year we had a break in with someone trying to steal our Land Rover. We challenged him and he picked up this Stanley knife. After the event I threw my toys out of the pram. We had already had bikes stolen. I just said we have to do something about this village. 'I had a meeting with the police and council but I was told there was not enough funds to clean up the village with police saying they only had a certain level of man power. It maybe the nature of the times and everybody is cutting back and yet money is wasted money relentlessly on things.' Mrs Valentine decided to find her own solution to the problem and employed Ms Honey instead, equipping her with her own uniform and tools as well as a JCB - emblazoned with signs that say: 'Stop me, ask me for free help.' As part of her role Ms Honey carries out daily patrols, clearing rubbish and notifying police of any break-ins. She even fixes light bulbs in people's houses and sits with the elderly. She has been ordered by Mrs Valentine to ignore councillors who claim she needs an Environmental licence to pick up rubbish. As part of her role Ms Honey collects rubbish and clears the local area of discarded litter (right) Ms Honey has been equipped with clothing and a motorised 'help' truck by Mrs Valentine for her work . She added: 'Clare does anything that needs doing in the locality - but obviously within reason. She picks litter, washes the bus stops and telephone boxes, picks up dog mess and helps anyone out. If an elderly person needs their ivy trimmed from the house - Clare will do it. Even if they need the newspaper paper picked up from the newsagents she will do it.' Following the Autumn statement, Durham County Council is expected to have to cut £16.2million from its budget in the next 12 months. It also recently came under fire for switching to fortnightly bin collections - which councillors claim has saved £5million. Last year the council also announced proposals to consult over the closure of five of its remaining care homes - saving an estimated £4million. Mrs Valentine said she feels council cuts have led to local areas like Grange Villa suffering and that resources are not always used in the best way. She said:  'They send out highly trained operative to specialised vehicles and protective clothing just to pick up a mattress lying around. How much does that cost? My view was that if a job needed doing well, you do it yourself. 'What Clare is doing is maintaining the village, doing what the council used to do. We used to have street sweepers on the streets permanently. But now I think the council will only come around once every three months or so with a team and they clean the streets. The trouble is the mess builds up in between.' Mrs Valentine is pictured with the Help truck she bought and Durham Constabulary's Mike Barton, who has backed the project and said keeping the community clean and safe is a way of showing people they care . Mrs Valentine has paid for signs to be put up throughout the village, welcoming people and making them aware who their PCSO is - winning the backing of police. Durham Constabulary's Chief Constable Mike Barton, told the Chronicle: 'This embodies what is really special about Grange Villa, where a community is taking the initiative and exhibiting what a great little village it is. 'Crime happens but County Durham is one of the safest places to live in the UK. It is great that Ling and John have led the way here . If there is no litter, graffiti or dog poo in a community then people like living there as they can see that people care.' As part of her role Ms Honey notifies police where there have been break-ins or property damaged. As handywoman Ms Honey trims hedges (left) and washes and cleans signs (right) throughout the village . Ms Honey has been in the role since November and police said it has already been a success in Grange Villa . Grange Villa PCSO Steve Larter said: 'Grange Villa has had a reputation for a number of years as being something of a problem area. Clare has been in the role for a month or so and things seem to be going really well.' Ms Valentine became a well-known character after she appeared on Dragon's Den in 2007 and turned down an offer of £50,000 to invest in her business - LINGsCARS. Shortly after starting the job in November, Ms Honey posted cards to all the houses of Grange Villa notifying them of the new service provided by Mrs Valentine. Ms Honey added: 'We posted leaflets when we started in everyone's doors. It was a bit weird at first as people would pass me and say 'morning Clare' and I would think 'how do they know my name?' I really enjoy the job. Ling just lets me get on with it.' Ling Valentine previously appeared on Dragon's Den but turned down an offer of £50,000 investment . 'It is a bizarre and unique job and when I saw it I realised it was the job for me - I don't think anywhere else does it. ' Oliver Sherratt, Durham County Council's head of direct services, said: 'The council has not significantly reduced clean and green services in the Grange Villas area or indeed anywhere else in the county. Most of the savings we have made have involved improving the efficiency of the services we provide for example, by cutting down our number of depots and reorganising but not reducing working hours. 'We do, however, welcome local communities doing what they can in partnership with the council to improve their local area.'","Ling Valentine was angry after being told few resources to clear up village .

"A former Philadelphia police officer who sat next to the First Lady during President Obama's 2009 State of the Union Address has been spared jail after an attack on his ex-girlfriend. Richard DeCoatsworth, 28, was sentenced Monday to 18 months' probation for a misdemeanor assault conviction on Sadie Martinez, 29. The judge also ordered DeCoatsworth to get counseling and issued a stay-away order barring him from contact with Martinez, who he had been with for 15 years, reports Philly.com. A former Philadelphia police officer who sat next to the First Lady during President Obama's 2009 State of the Union Address (pictured) has been spared jail after an attack on his ex-girlfriend . DeCoatsworth had been charged with assaulting the girlfriend during a heated argument in May 2013 in the Port Richmond row house they shared. She said he choked her and punched her in the mouth, but he said he accidentally hit her while trying to knock away a brick she was brandishing as he tried to get into his car. 'There were some good times and some bad times and some horrible times' during their stormy relationship,' he said in November. In November, a Common Pleas Court jury acquitted DeCoatsworth of recklessly endangering another person but convicted him of simple assault. Prosecutors had earlier also accused DeCoatsworth of having raped two prostitutes at gunpoint but dropped those charges in September, which allowed his release from jail. A bullet struck DeCoatsworth in the mouth during a routine traffic stop in September 2007, but he still went in pursuit of his assailant before collapsing and radioing for help . DeCoatsworth was hailed as a hero after he was shot in the face during a traffic stop in September 2007 but still managed to chase after his attacker, who was later sentenced to 36 to 72 years in prison. He was invited by Vice President Joe Biden to attend the president's televised February 2009 address to Congress and sat with first lady Michelle Obama. But complaints mounted about his use of force after he returned to work, when he shot a motorcyclist during a scuffle. The Philadelphia cop retired in December 2011 at age 25 after accumulating nine Internal Affairs complaints lodged by citizens accusing him of assault, abuse and misconduct. Before leaving the force, DeCoatsworth was involved in two others incidents in April and September of 2009 where he shot two suspects . A previous lawyer said DeCoatsworth,  was battling a painkiller addiction stemming from his injury. DeCoatsworth did not make a statement before he was sentenced. Defense attorney L. George Parry said DeCoatsworth will try to get his probation transferred to Florida, where he intends to relocate and work in a no-kill animal shelter. Parry said he believes DeCoatsworth was suffering for years from post-traumatic stress disorder stemming from the 2007 shotgun blast. 'I think in large part the counseling will be beneficial for him,' Parry added.","Richard DeCoatsworth, 28, was sentenced Monday to 18 months probation for a misdemeanor assault conviction on Sadie Martinez, 29 .

In a statement, Malaysia Airlines confirmed its Internet domain had been compromised and that they were redirecting users. The statement said: 'At this stage, Malaysia Airlines' web servers are intact,' but added it could take nearly 24 hours to fully resolve the issue, which it had reported to Malaysian authorities. They added: 'Malaysia Airlines assures customers and clients that its website was not hacked and this temporary glitch does not affect their bookings and that user data remains secured.'

The unexplained loss of MH370 and the airlines' poor crisis-handling in the aftermath of the disappearance severely damaged public confidence in the carrier, sending the business into a tailspin. In July, flight MH17 was also shot down over eastern Ukraine, killing all 298 passengers and crew.

"Cindra Ladd claims that Bill Cosby drugged and then raped her back in 1969 . The wife of Oscar-winning Hollywood producer Alan Ladd Jr. is the latest woman to come forward and accuse Bill Cosby of sexual assault. Cindra Ladd, a philanthropist and former entertainment executive, claims that the comedian drugged and then raped her back in 1969. 'It was obvious to me that he had had sex with me,' she wrote in a Huffington Post blog. 'I was horrified, embarrassed and ashamed. There was a mirror above the bed, which shocked me further.' Ladd recalls that she was 21, single and living in New York City when she met Cosby, then 32 and already married to his wife Camille. When Cosby asked for her number she willingly gave it to him and they started hanging out and going for meals. One night the pair were supposed to see a movie, but when Ladd said she had a 'terrible headache' Cosby was quick to offer her a pill. 'I asked a couple of times what it was,' she wrote. 'Each time he reassured me, asking, 'Don't you trust me?' Of course I did. This was Bill Cosby.' After that, Ladd says her memory was a blur although she vaguely remembered watching a Japanese samurai movie. 'I don't remember where the theater was nor very much of the evening,' she wrote. 'What I do recall, vividly and clearly, is waking up the next morning nude in the bed of his friend's apartment and seeing Cosby wearing a white terrycloth bathrobe and acting as if there was nothing unusual.' Ladd didn't however alert the authorities. 'It never occurred to me to go to the police,' she wrote. 'It was a different time and 'date rape' was a concept that didn't exist. Scroll down for video . Cosby in 1969 and recently: Over the past three months, at least two dozen women have come forward alleging that Cosby had sexually abused them . Ladd writes that she thought she was the only woman who Cosby had assaulted, until other women started coming forward. 'I told my story to our attorney, who is also a good friend, because I was considering going public then, but eventually chose not to because the case was settled,' she wrote. 'This is the first time I have chosen to speak out about that night. It is also the last time I intend to address it publicly. 'I have no plans to sue, I don't want or need money. I have no plans for a press conference or for doing any interviews,' she added. Ladd writes that she has run into Cosby once since then in the late 60s. 'In the years since that night I have crossed paths with Cosby only once, when my husband, a highly successful Oscar-winning film executive and producer, introduced me to him,' she wrote. Ladd said she only told her husband Alan about the incident nine years ago, after another woman came forward with similar accusations . 'I was shaking, wondering if he would recognize me by my unusual first name. His reaction spoke volumes. To Bill Cosby, I was just another stranger.' Ladd said she only told her husband - the former president of 20th Century Fox and an Oscar-winning film producer - about the incident nine years ago, after another woman came forward with similar accusations. Over the past three months, at least two dozen women, including former supermodels Beverly Johnson and Janice Dickinson, have come forward alleging that Cosby had sexually abused them. Many of the allegations are decades old and fall outside the statute of limitations for criminal or civil cases.

"He prefers motorbikes to limousines, refuses to ever wear a tie and lives in a block of flats in one of the most densely populated areas of Greece. New Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras is regarded as a true man of the people, a world away from Greece's political elite which has been characterised by corruption. With the help of his youthful good looks and down-to-earth nature (he happily takes out the rubbish), he has swept to power on a promise to smash the EU's grip on the country's economy. Scroll down for video . Syriza leader Alexis Tsipras greets supporters following his victory in the election in Athens . Right behind her man: Mr Tsipras, followed by his partner Peristera (Betty) Batziana, greets his  supporters outside Syriza's headquarters after his party's win in Sunday's general election . Mr Tsipras and Ms Batziana got together in 1987 when they were at high school together in Athens . His anti-austerity, left-wing Syriza party swept to victory in the Greek general election - sparking fears of renewed chaos in the euro zone. He has pledged to renegotiate Greece's €240billion bailout deal - and reverse many of the reforms that EU creditors demanded in exchange for keeping Greece financially afloat since 2010. That has placed the country on a collision course with Germany over its massive bailout deal, with Angela Merkel effectively saying the new Greek government can forget any kind of debt relief. The win has been hailed by left and right-wing parties across Europe - led by Spain's Podemos, which is vowing a similar general election win this year. The 40-year-old was sworn in this afternoon, making him the youngest Greek Prime Minister for more than 150 years. Tsipras - characteristically without a tie - also broke with tradition by taking a civil instead of a religious oath, pledging to 'always serve the interests of the Greek people'. Shunning the stereotype of Greek politics, Mr Tsipras is known for his relaxed attitude: travelling around Athens on motorbikes and preferring open-necked shirts to a suit and tie. He lives with his partner, Betty Batziana, an electrical and computer engineer, with their two boys - Phoebus and Orpheus - in an apartment block in Kypseli, a modest, working-class area of Athens. Their youngest son's middle name is Ernesto – a tribute to Che Guevara, one of Mr Tsipras's idols. He had never been that interested in politics, instead throwing his energy into sport at a young age until he was sidelined with a knee injury. But after meeting Ms Batziana, something of a firebrand student, in 1987 when they were at high school together in Athens, she convinced him to join the Communist Youth of Greece in 1990. By his side: Ms Batziana convinced Mr Tsipras to join the Communist Youth of Greece in 1990 after they had met three years earlier at high school in Athens . Humble: The ramshackle block of flats where Tsipras and his partner, Betty Batziana, an electrical and computer engineer, live with their two children in one of the most densely populated areas of Athens . Armonias (Harmony) Street  where Tsipras lives in a seven-storey block in the Kypseli district of Athens . The Kypseli district of Athens, one of the most densely populated areas of Greece, where Alexis Tsipras lives . A year later, the pair found themselves at the centre of student protests against unpopular education reforms. At the tender age of 17, he was spearheading sit-in demonstrations at their school that saw students living and sleeping in the building for weeks. Ms Batzianas was right by his side then - and still is now - with many seeing her as the driving force behind her partner's leadership. According to friends from the University of Patras, where she graduated in electrical engineering, she is strong-willed, militant and dynamic. Making history: Alexis Tsipras, the leader of Greece's far-left Syriza party is sworn in as prime minister, which at 40 years old, makes him the youngest leader for more than 150 years . Breaking with tradition: Tsipras - characteristically without a tie - took a civil instead of a religious oath, pledging to 'always serve the interests of the Greek people' Cheering: Syriza's supporters celebrate after the general victory is confirmed late on Sunday night . The supporters were told: 'Our priority from tomorrow will be to restore popular sovereignty in the country, to give justice, to clash with old establishments. To clash with the regime of corruption. To promote reforms in the state, public administration, everywhere' She once hauled one of her professors to court when he tried undermine her work on a doctoral thesis, it was reported by the Greek Reporter. She also hates spending hours shopping, doesn't like going for regular trips to the hairdressers and won't spend money on clothes. Supporter Eleni Sarli, 54, told The Times: 'He is the good guy everybody wants to be and the honest politician everyone wants to trust.' After training as an engineer, Mr Tsipras eventually went into politics full-time. He was a member of the youth wing of the Greek Communist Party, the KKE, rising to prominence as candidate for the mayor of Athens in 2006. Tsipras became leader of Syriza in 2008 at the age of 34 at the height of Greece's economic crisis. Syriza was formed in 2004 as a coalition of moderate Communists, Trotskyists, ecologists and other leftist groups, but has occasionally found it difficult to present a united front. He has also become the undisputed star of the radical European left, standing against Jean-Claude Juncker in May's election for European Commission president. After his general election victory last night, Mr Tsipras told a rally of thousands of supporters he would defeat 'austerity which destroys our common European future', his speech backed by the booming sounds of Rock the Casbah by The Clash. He said: 'I would like to reassure you that the new Greek government will be ready to co-operate and negotiate for the first time with our partners for a mutually beneficial and sustainable solution so Greece comes out of a vicious circle of debt. 'We have a great opportunity for a new beginning both in Greece and in Europe. For a new policy, for a new model of relations based on mutual respect.'","Alexis Tsipras, 40, prefers motorbikes to limousines and never wears a tie .

"This is the moment a former showjumping horse had to be winched out of a metre-wide well half-full of water, after falling in. Foxy, a 12-year-old Irish Sport horse had to be pulled to safety in a harness upside down after she became stuck in water inside a well near Hinckley in Leicestershire. Two fire crews were called to help the horse after she was heard crying for help after falling through a thin covering of wood over the well. Foxy, a former showjumping horse, had to be winched out of a metre-wide well she had fallen into . When crews arrived they could only see the animal's head and front legs poking out of the water filled well . Rescuers found her with just her head and front knees poking out and it was unclear how many hours the animal had been stuck for. Mark Edwards, from Leicestershire Fire and Rescue's Technical Rescue Team said: 'Rescuing Foxy was out of the ordinary. 'We'd never seen anything like this before. 'It's not a situation that we envisage, so you can't train for it. 'You'd never think a horse could get into that position in the first place. 'When we got there we could only see her head, neck and front knees - everything else was submerged.' Warwickshire Fire and Rescue's Animal Rescue team were also called and helped secure a around the front of her body so she could be slowly winched out of the well. As the rescue party weren't sure of the success of the operation, they had to request a police marksman for the worst case scenario. This was not necessary but in the process of being freed the back of one of Foxy's knees was cut and fractured and dirty water seeped into the wound. This led to a joint infection, and she required eight weeks of intensive care and treatment at Rossdales Equine Hospital. Two fire crews were called to winch Foxy to safety from where she had fallen down into the covered well . Crews strapped Foxy to a harness as they began to pull her free from the water and the narrow well . It was unclear how long Foxy had been stuck in the well and the alarm was only raised when she cried out . As she was pulled out of the well, Foxy damaged one of her legs and later contracted a joint infection . The animal's leg was cut and became infected and she needed veterinary care which ran to a total of £20,000 . This treatment cost £20,000 of vet bills to get her back on her feet. But the insurance only offered £2,000 towards the fees due to a previous tendon condition so the family had to use owner Amy Badge's savings and sell her father's bike to cover the cost. Miss Badge only found out about the fate of her pet after her parents telephoned her after she had completed her first year exams at Bath University. She said: 'I'd just finished my last exam when my dad rung. 'I knew something had been wrong as he had called earlier in the week asking me to call once I'd finished. 'It's unbelievable how far she's come in eight months. 'She's still a bit wary around crowds of people but apart from that she's almost fully recovered.' Miss Badge has owned the animal for five years and used to compete in county showjumping events with her. The grey mare suffered a fractured back knee from the rescue but eight months after surgery is now back on her feet. Miss Badge added: 'It's a bit like a car being written off. 'The insurance company said that due to her tendon problems she was only worth £2000. 'Obviously to us she's invaluable so we've done whatever was necessary to get her healthy again. 'I know I'll never be able to jump her again but seeing her back on her feet was worth it.' Owner Amy Badge said she is relieved the horse is back on her feet again after vets' bills costing £20,000 . Foxy is now back on her feet eight months after the ordeal, which left her with a fractured leg and infection .

"A former Apple CEO who allegedly fired Steve Jobs in the 1980s from the company he founded has been accused of hiding his fortune during a divorce battle. John Sculley, who clashed with Jobs during his tenure at the tech giant, allegedly signed over investments worth $25million to his brothers to avoid them being claimed by Carol 'Leezy' Sculley. Sculley, who spent ten years at the helm of the tech company, finalized his divorce in 2011, having claimed their combined worth was just $4.8million, Page Six reported. Accusations: John Sculley, left, allegedly fired Apple founder Steve Jobs, right, from his own company. he is now being accused of hiding money from his ex-wife during their divorce . But his ex-wife claims that he had in fact been squirreling away assets more than a decade in advance, after starting an affair with a former Apple colleague in 2000. According to filings from 2013 seen by Page Six, Sculley asked his brothers Arthur and David to take on assets for him by starting a joint investment firm called Sculley Brothers - charges Sculley denies. The filing, made in Palm Beach, Florida, in 2013, accuses Sculley of lying to court. It then alleges he 'submitted a false financial affidavit . . . and failed to fully and honestly disclose his assets.' Those assets are later described as 'substantial private equity investments and investments in privately held companies and ventures around the globe'. Some estimates say that Sculley is worth as much as $200million in total. His ten-year career at Apple saw some of its least successful products - including an iPad forerunner called Newton - and is viewed as a decline ahead of its resurgence in recent years. Tenure: Sculley, pictured center above with Jobs (left) and co-founder Steve Wozniak (right) was Apple CEO for 10 years . Sculley has previously spoken about his sometimes-fractious relationship with Jobs, which came to a head in a dispute over the pricing of the Apple Macintosh computer. Jobs wanted it to be cheap to drive sales and interest, while Sculley wanted to keep the price higher to protect its other products and defend the company's bottom line. Sculley, who also defended his tenure at the company, said in 2012: '[Apple] was the most profitable computer company in the world - not just personal computers - and Apple was the number one selling computer. 'So the myth that I fired Steve wasn't true and the myth that I destroyed Apple, that wasn't true either.' A representative for Sculley refuted the claims. He told DailyMail.com: 'The reality is that this case has been in the court of law for a number of years, and leaking false items to the media in a desire to pressure Mr. Sculley into settling this case is despicable. 'There is zero truth to these allegations. Mr. Sculley is confident this case will result in a full vindication for him.'","John Sculley - CEO from 1983 to 1993 - accused by ex-wife Carol .

"A boyfriend told his partner he would 'teach her a lesson' during a drunken row before dousing her in petrol, setting her alight and locking her in a burning flat, a court has heard. Rebecca Major, 32, survived by throwing a table through a window and jumping through from the upstairs flat but suffered 40 per cent burns and a fractured skull and sternum in the fall, Teesside Crown Court was told. Her partner Edward McArthur, 40, from Darlington, denies attempted murder and arson with intent to endanger life. Rebecca Major, 32, suffered 40 per cent burns and a fractured skull and sternum when she jumped out of a flat . Christine Egerton, for the prosecution, said the couple, who had been together for more than a year, were staying at McArthur's mother's flat. On August 4 last year, they had both been drinking and when a row broke out McArthur lost his temper. He left the room and came back with a container of petrol which he poured over his girlfriend's head, the jury heard. Miss Egerton said: 'As he poured it over her, she felt it on her skin, she felt it in her eyes and it stung her. 'At that stage she thought that was all he was going to do. She thought he was doing that, pouring that caustic substance on her, to shock her and that would be it. 'However, the next thing he did was to light it. He ran out of the door and locked her in the flat. 'She shouted after him thinking that he would come back and help her. He didn't.' Ms Major used a wet towel and put it on her face as fire gripped the flat, then made her escape by smashing the window and falling to the ground. Edward McArthur, 40, from Darlington, denies attempted murder and arson with intent to endanger life . The prosecution said McArthur 'hung around' after starting the fire and he told a police officer someone had thrown petrol into the flat. He said he had gone downstairs, heard an explosion and seen someone running away. After he was arrested he did not answer the police questions, the jury heard. He will claim in his defence he poured petrol over Ms Major 'to frighten her, not to injure her' and had then lit a cigarette which accidentally started the fire. He will say he helped Ms Major escape by kicking the window through, Miss Egerton said. The prosecution said: 'Anyone who pours petrol over another person, as he did, and then sets fire to them, as he did, must have only one intention. That intention must be to kill that other person. 'Anyone who distributes a flammable liquid around a flat when somebody is in that flat must have an intention to endanger the life of another as a consequence of the fire starting.' Ms Major was still in a hospital gown, with thick bandages on her hands and an oxygen mask on when she was first videoed giving an interview to police. In the recording played to the court, she  said: 'He basically told me to shut up. I was trying to calm him down. He went, 'I will teach you a lesson, you silly b****'. 'He went out of the room, came back in and poured petrol over me. 'I didn't think for one second he would light it. He lit the petrol and ran out of the door and locked it. I shouted 'Eddy, ""please"". 'The flat was on fire, it went up really quick. I panicked a bit and then I ran and got a cloth, wet it and put it over my face. 'I couldn't see because of the flames.' She said the next thing she remembered after smashing the window and jumping was waking up in hospital. She required skin grafts from her legs which were transferred to her arms. Ms Major guessed McArthur's motivation to kill her was because he might have another woman, the court heard. 'He always said to me, ""I will never let you have another one after me""', she said in the video. A court heard how the couple were staying at McArthur's mother's flat in Darlington (pictured) when a drunken row broke out and McArthur lost his temper. He poured petrol over his girlfriend's head, the jury heard . In a second interview some weeks later, also filmed at the Burns Unit of the Royal Victoria Infirmary, Newcastle, she recalled McArthur telling her 'You will pay for this' before he fetched the petrol. Still requiring oxygen, Ms Major remembered that some days before the attack, she found him with an axe and a petrol container in the flat. But she never thought he would use it on her. She told detectives: 'I didn't know what I had done to deserve this. I'd not cheated on him. Nothing. 'It was horrible, I just thought, this is it, I've had it.' She told the officers interviewing her in September she was in agony, and taking many painkillers. Crying, she said: 'I am angry. He has ruined me because I will never be what I was.' She said they had argued before and their relationship was 'up and down'. She told police: 'Normally when we argued he didn't raise his hand to me. From not doing anything to setting me on fire, it's crazy.' McArthur, of Darlington, denies attempted murder and arson with intent to endanger life. The trial continues.

"Scarlet O'Connor, from Walkden, Greater Manchester, was forced to flee to Australia after a rejected lover set her house on fire . A 23-year-old has told how she was forced to flee to Australia after a rejected lover bombarded her with thousands of text messages then set fire to her home. Scarlet O'Connor, from Walkden, Greater Manchester, had known Aiden Feeney for four years before they had a one-night stand in August 2013. But, despite Ms O'Connor making it clear that the relationship was purely platonic, the jilted 24-year-old launched a hate campaign against his former lover. He sent her up to 3,000 text messages in the space of four days, spoke of ‘ripping her head off’ and even gloated that he knew someone who would burn her house down in exchange for £1,000. Soon after, Feeney paid a teenager £850 to torch Miss O'Connor's home, an act which caused £18,000 worth of damage and destroyed the entire ground floor. Feeney was finally jailed for eight-and-a-half years in August  after being found guilty of arson with intent to endanger life. He was also found guilty of two counts of harassment. But despite Feeney being behind bars, Miss O'Connor is still haunted by the memories of her terrifying ordeal and decided to start a new life in Perth. Speaking about the incident, Miss O'Connor said: 'Aiden ruined my life. For weeks, I was too scared to sleep because I was worried about what he'd do and I was always looking over my shoulder. 'I'm gutted Aiden will only serve half of his sentence. I don't even want to think about what he'll do once he's released. 'I moved away from the UK because I'd had a rubbish year and I knew going to Australia would help me forget the memories.' Miss O'Connor, now a part-time waitress, told how she became a nervous wreck and refused to leave her home after she started being hounded by unemployed Feeney. She said: 'I made it clear that I thought of him as a friend and nothing more, but he pestered me for a date. 'I declined and he became possessive, even texting me accusing me of speaking to other boys. 'I told him that he wasn't my boyfriend and I could do whatever I wanted. He became angry and made threatening calls to my male friends, and sent me texts saying: ""Watch what happens if you keep texting these guys"".' The 23-year-old (left) was subjected to a hate campaign by Aiden Feeney, 24, (right) after she refused his requests to go on a date together . The pair (pictured together) were friends for four years before they slept together in August 2013, but Miss O'Connor said she always made it clear that she did not want to pursue a relationship with Feeney . Days later, the living room window at Miss O'Connor's home - which she shared with her sister Lauren, 28, and housemate Nadia, 31 - was smashed. Feeney then bombarded Ms O'Connor with texts, begging her to go on a date with him. He even texted her telling her how he knew someone who would burn down her house. The 24-year-old, from Worsley, Greater Manchester, promised to end the abuse if Miss O'Connor agreed to a date with him. But when she refused, he texted her threatening messages, including one that read: 'Watch what happens'. The threats prompted firemen to carry out an urgent risk assessment of Miss O’Connor's home, where they installed extra smoke alarms and taped up the letterbox  as a precaution. Feeney even paid a teenager £850 to torch Miss O'Connor's home, an act which caused £18,000 worth of damage and destroyed the entire ground floor (pictured) Feeney was jailed for eight-and-a-half years in August after being found guilty of arson with intent to endanger life and two counts of harassment . She said: 'Aiden's threats were relentless. I lived in constant fear and was crying all the time. 'I became reclusive and was gripped by worry whenever I plucked the courage to leave my house. Tyler Bennett, 19, (pictured) was jailed for four years after being convicted of arson with intent to endanger life . She added: 'I was terrified. My sister's boyfriend, a firefighter, secured our house by sealing the letterbox, and installing a panic button and further fire alarms. 'I kept my ordeal secret from my parents as I was too embarrassed to tell them. I didn't want them worrying about me.' One month later, Miss O'Connor's friends finally convinced her to join them on a night out. But when she returned, she found her housemate's car window had been bricked. Worried for her safety, Miss O'Connor stayed over at her friend's house. Then, a few weeks later in September, she was woken by a phone call from her sister, screaming that their house was on fire. After the curtains caught on fire, the blaze spread through the property, destroying the entire ground floor. Her sister, who was in the house at the time, managed to escape unharmed. Feeney was arrested a week later after police received reports of him hiding in an abandoned flat. It later emerged that he had paid Tyler Bennett, 19, £850 to carry out the job. Bennett had taken a taxi to the house, where he threw firelighters through the front window after being unable to open the letterbox. On another occasion, Miss O'Connor's sister had a brick thrown through  her car window (pictured left) and windscreen (pictured right) The house Miss O'Connor shared with her friend and sister was also targeted in an attack, which left the front window smashed (pictured) Feeney and Bennett were convicted at Manchester Crown Court in August. The court heard how Feeney, who tried and failed to get in to the Army, already has convictions for arson and harassment after targeting a previous girlfriend. Bennett was jailed for four years after being convicted of arson with intent to endanger life. Despite moving to the other side of the world, Ms O'Connor remains affected by Feeney's actions. She said: 'I have no trust any more. I certainly don't want to get involved with any more men. 'If I'd have stayed in England, I'd have spent the rest of my life looking over my shoulder.'","Aiden Feeney, 24, launched a hate campaign against Scarlet O'Connor .

"Britain is sleepwalking towards a surveillance society because of the proliferation of CCTV cameras, an independent watchdog has warned . Britain is sleepwalking towards a surveillance society because of the proliferation of CCTV cameras, an independent watchdog has warned. The UK’s surveillance tsar Tony Porter says the nation’s privacy is being increasingly invaded – but many of the cameras are doing nothing to stop crime or keep the public safe. Mr Porter called for a public debate and greater regulation to ensure cameras ‘do not proliferate unnecessarily’. He added: ‘We have millions of cameras in this country and Europeans look at us askance that our society actually accepts the volume of cameras we do. ‘You can still maintain the balance of excellent surveillance but not have a propagation that is actually useless. ‘Run well, it’s a useful tool for society. But to quote a former information commissioner, “we should not sleepwalk into a surveillance society”.’ Mr Porter, who is responsible for overseeing about 100,000 publicly-operated CCTV cameras, said it was imperative that local authorities tell the public exactly how many were watching the streets. The independent surveillance commissioner is also concerned about the rising use of body-worn video, drones and number-plate recognition systems, or ANPR. Britain has one of the largest CCTV networks in the world. On top of the publicly-operated cameras there are another 6million private and domestic surveillance cameras nationwide. Mr Porter said some councils have found they were wasting hundreds of thousands of pounds on ineffective cameras. One, a West Midlands local authority, reviewed its surveillance and saved £250,000 by reducing the number of ineffective cameras. Meanwhile, Dyfed-Powys Police – which covers more than half of Wales – could stop monitoring CCTV after a review found little evidence the cameras deterred crime or anti-social behaviour. Scroll down for video . The UK’s surveillance tsar Tony Porter says the nation’s privacy is being increasingly invaded – but many of the cameras are doing nothing to stop crime or keep the public safe . Problems include organisations using different CCTV equipment and networks. It means that, for instance, a shoplifter being tracked by council CCTV in a public street is lost when they flee into a shopping centre where the system is privately owned. Mr Porter also highlighted cases where the quality or format of footage meant it could not be downloaded or used by the police or courts. Mr Porter, a former senior counter-terrorism officer at the London Olympics, reiterated concerns about the use of drones and body-worn cameras. Police, housing and environmental health officers, landlords, door supervisors, university security staff and even some supermarket workers are wearing state-of-the-art cameras to capture anti-social behaviour on film. He said: ‘Technology can support law enforcement and protect society. My concern is about the introduction of poor surveillance that doesn’t benefit society.’ Mr Porter, above, called for a public debate and greater regulation to ensure cameras ‘do not proliferate unnecessarily’ He warned that spiralling levels of surveillance, especially lightweight cameras worn on uniforms, could harm policing by making the public reluctant to talk to officers if they were confronted with cameras. But at the same time, he said, it would be ‘short-sighted’ for local authorities to cut CCTV as part of an austerity drive. The Local Government Association said town halls consult residents, businesses and police on whether CCTV is appropriate in an area, and operate in accordance with the code of practice. A spokesman added: ‘Councils are not going to spend money on CCTV cameras unless they genuinely believe they will work. Many are actually scaling back CCTV operations.’","Tony Porter claims the nation’s privacy is being increasingly invaded .

"Tweets often reveal growing trends among young people - and now scientists have revealed cannabis has become a popular topic. During a single month, researchers identified more than seven million tweets referring to marijuana, with 'pro-pot' messages outnumbering those opposed to the drug by 15 to one. Most of those sending and receiving 'pot tweets' were under the age of 25, and many in their teens, said the team. Scroll down for video . An examination of a random sample of almost 7,000 tweets from these accounts revealed that 77 per cent were pro-marijuana, 5 per cent against, and 18 per cent neutral . US psychiatrist and lead author Dr Patricia Cavazos-Rehg, from the Washington University Institute for Public Health, said: 'It's a concern because frequent marijuana use can affect brain structures and interfere with cognitive function, emotional development and academic performance. 'The younger people are when they begin using marijuana, the more likely they are to become dependent. 'A lot of young people will phase out of marijuana use as they get older, but unfortunately, we're not good at predicting who those individuals are.' The findings, reported in the Journal of Adolescent Health, follow a computer search of tweets conducted between February 5 and March 5 last year. Working with social media analytics company Simply Measured, the researchers looked for every tweet that mentioned marijuana. During a single month, researchers identified more than seven million tweets referring to marijuana, with 'pro-pot' messages outnumbering those opposed to the drug by 15 to one . Using search terms such as 'joint', 'blunt', 'weed', 'stoner' and 'bong', the team turned up more than 7.6 million tweets referencing the drug. An examination of a random sample of almost 7,000 tweets from these accounts revealed that 77 per cent were pro-marijuana, 5 per cent against, and 18 per cent neutral. Cannabis smokers in their 30s have lungs so badly damaged that they look like an 80 year old’s, doctors have warned. They say that young adults who have smoked cannabis for less than a decade are turning up at A&E with a severe, rapid and advanced form of the lung disease emphysema. Some are in their 30s and in some cases their lungs are so badly damaged that they are put on long-term oxygen therapy. Emphysema, in which the millions of tiny air sacs in the lungs are gradually damaged, is normally caused by tobacco and usually occurs late in life. It is thought the cannabis-tobacco mixture found in joints is more damaging because they are often smoked without a filter. Cannabis smokers also tend to inhale for longer and much of the cannabis on sale today is much stronger than in the past. Dr Cavazos-Rehg added: 'Many people believe marijuana use is harmless, and social media conversations almost certainly drive some of those opinions, making the drug appear socially acceptable. 'Although we can't yet link pro-pot tweets to actual drug use, we should be worried because many people are receiving these messages are at an age when they are most likely to experiment with drugs and develop problems with substance use.' People tweeting pro-marijuana messages had more than 50 million Twitter followers - around 12 times more than those tweeting anti-marijuana messages. Pro-pot tweets were most commonly aimed at encouraging use of cannabis and its legalisation, and made claims about the drug's health benefit. And 10 per cent of the pro-marijuana tweets were sent by individuals who said they were taking the drug or high at the time. Anti-marijuana tweets often states that the drug's users were 'losers' or unproductive, or that taking cannabis is unattractive. They also stressed that the drug was harmful, or that the person tweeting was against legalisation. The scientists focused their analysis on Twitter accounts with more than 775 followers, as well as those with 'Klout scores' of 44 and above. A Klout score measures social media influences on a scale of one to 100. Using search terms such as 'joint', 'blunt', 'weed', 'stoner' and 'bong', the team turned up more than 7.6 million tweets referencing the drug.

"In the underworld of illegal drug trafficking, identical twins Pedro and Margarito Flores rose from middling Chicago dealers to partners of Mexico's most notorious cartel lord, eventually building a nearly $2 billion franchise that spanned much of North America. Anyone convicted of trafficking a fraction as much cocaine and heroin could normally expect a life sentence. But the twins can enter their sentencing hearing Tuesday confident of receiving far less. Because they spilled secrets that led to the indictments of Joaquin 'El Chapo' Guzman, a half-dozen of his lieutenants and about 40 lower-level traffickers, prosecutors are asking for a remarkably lenient term — around 10 years. If credited for six years in protective custody, the pair could go free within a few years. Scroll down for video . Drug-running twin brothers Pedro, left, and Margarito Flores' cooperation with federal authorities has led to the indictment of dozens of Mexican drug runners including Joaquin Guzman . Guzman 'ran the one of the biggest trafficking organizations in the last 100 years, and these brothers were crucial in helping to bring him and his people to justice,' said Jack Riley, former head of the Drug Enforcement Administration office in Chicago and now the agency's No. 3 in Washington. 'I don't think you can get bigger than that.' Details of the twins' story have been kept under seal for years, but recently opened federal government files, and an Associated Press review of documents in related cases, have lifted some of the secrecy surrounding the two, offering a fuller narrative of their journey from flamboyant teen traffickers to associates of Guzman, who was captured last year by Mexican authorities. American authorities portray the twins as among the most valuable drug traffickers who ever became informants. Chicago criminal lawyer Joe Lopez, who represented several clients indicted on evidence from the twins, put it more starkly: 'They're some of the most significant rats in U.S. history.' Drug-world figures weighed in on their importance, too, in their own way. After word spread in mid-2009 that the twins had turned informants, their father was kidnapped, according to government documents. A note left for the twins on the windshield of his abandoned car read, 'Shut up or we are going to send you his head.' He is presumed dead. The twins cooperation with authorities led to the indictments of Joaquin 'El Chapo' Guzman, above, a half-dozen of his lieutenants and about 40 lower-level traffickers, prosecutors are asking for a remarkably lenient term — around 10 years . Prosecutors cited his death and the fact that the twins — as well as their mother, wives and children — will live in fear for the rest of their lives as one reason for leniency. They also want to use the lighter sentence as an enticement to urge other cartel associates to cooperate. The threat of retaliation by cartel members looms over the case. Since becoming informants, the 33-year-old siblings have never appeared in public. Because of the constant danger, the name of their defense attorney has also been kept secret. And it's unclear how the brothers will be protected in prison or after their release. The speed with which the 5-foot-4 twins ascended the drug-world hierarchy had something to do with location. Chicago's Little Village neighborhood, where they grew up, is surrounded by major rail lines and highways. It's an aspiring trafficker's dream — a transportation hub within a city that's a transportation hub to the nation. As dealers in their teens, they had a reputation for being flashy but savvy, said Lopez, who had some clients from the same neighborhood. The twins' fondness for bling was illustrated by a list of items agents said they would forfeit. It included more than $400,000 in jewelry. Only after the brothers fled Chicago around 2004 for Mexico, apparently fearing arrest following their indictment in Milwaukee, did their trafficking careers soar. It's not clear how they first made contact with the Sinaloa cartel, but by mid-2005 they were summoned by Guzman himself, according to government filings. Flown to an airstrip in Sinaloa, they were taken to a secret mountain compound to hammer out drug deals with the kingpin. From 2004 on, prosecutors say, the brothers ran their entire U.S. operation from a Mexican ranch, issuing orders by phone. Their network stretched from New York, Detroit and Washington, D.C., to Los Angeles and Vancouver, Canada. Strict rules governed the drug shipments. Guzman's people got the drugs across the U.S.-Mexico border — sometimes via tunnels — and were responsible until the packages were transferred to Flores associates in the U.S. If the drugs were lost somewhere between that point and Chicago, the brothers would be on the hook for the full cost. Court documents say the twins approached U.S. authorities on their own in the summer of 2008, offering to cooperate. The papers do not explain why, though it happened during bloody conflicts between cartels, and the twins may have feared they would soon fall victim. Still, they continued to do business with the cartel, now with the aim of gathering evidence. According to court documents, they met Guzman again in his mountain compound in October 2008, when he made an ominous request of Margarito Flores: Could he obtain rocket and grenade launchers? They would use them, he was told, to attack a U.S. or Mexican government office to send the message that cartel suspects were not to be extradited. The pressure on the twins was building. Then something triggered U.S. agents' concern. On Nov. 30, 2008, they gave the brothers two hours' notice to get out of Mexico. They flew to Chicago with little but the clothing they wore. But the brothers' scheming did not stop immediately. In Chicago, the two sought to squirrel away millions in ill-gotten gains, toying with the idea of burying some of the money, filings say. While in custody, they also managed to purchase a $100,000 Bentley as a gift for Pedro's wife. They had to give it up when agents learned what they had done.","Drug-running identical twin brothers Pedro and Margarito Flores are due to be sentenced on Tuesday .

"A new TV show in Peru has captured the moment unwitting men have been caught wolf-whistling their own mothers. The experiment took two mothers, whose sons were identified as repeat cat-callers, and disguised them using make-up, wigs and clothes. The women then women walked past their sons to gauge their reaction. The mother wearing a disguise of a wig and sunglasses walks past her unsuspecting son and a friend, before he makes a comment towards her . The mother then goes over to confront her child, who is still unaware the woman is actually his parent . The man acts in horror as he realises it is his own mother and she launches into a tirade, accusing him of being dirty . The mother gets so angry with her son, she then takes off her bag and proceeds to hit him with it due to this behaviour . In the first case, the mother is dressed in a short black dress and walks past her son and a friend in the street. The son then unwittingly makes a comment at his mother saying 'tasty panties' which prompts her to go and confront him. She then removes her sunglasses and the man then realises he has just cat-called his own mother. The mother then launches into a tirade, accusing him of being dirty and saying she never taught him to talk to women in that manner. Another mother, wearing a black wig walks past her son, who is standing working on the streets of Lima . After making a remark towards his mother, she then turns around and goes over to confront him . She then takes off her wig to reveal herself and then throws it on the floor in anger after being disgusted by her son's behaviour . The mother then tells her son he should be ashamed of himself for speaking to her like that, as he pleads with her to calm down . She then gets so angry with her child that she then removes her bag and hits him with it. Meanwhile in the second case, the mother wearing a green dress, walks past her son, who calls her 'piggy'. She then calls his name before taking off her wig and confronting her son, hitting him with her hairpiece. The man then tries to claim he didn't make the remark but is then forced to apologise to his mother before she walks off . She too launches into a tirade telling her son to he should be ashamed of himself, while he pleads with his mother to quieten down as he is working. He then tries to claim he didn't make the remark and it a man in a nearby car, but he eventually apologises before his mother walks off. The video ends with a warning saying men should start respecting women before they unwittingly harass their own mothers. It comes after the video claims that seven in 10 women say they have experienced sexual harassment on the streets of the Peruvian capital Lima.","Peruvian TV show identified two men deemed as repeat cat-callers .

"Top Gear favourite The Stig headed out on the road at a more sedate pace today as a giant figure of the show's test driver headed across Europe on a truck. The nine-metre statue was strapped to a flat-bed truck as it headed from the programme's HQ at Dunsfold in Surrey to Poland where it will eventually be put up in Warsaw. The huge figure, which has taken a team of three people two months to design and build, is being taken through various locations to promote the launch of a new global TV channel called BBC Brit. Scroll down for video . The giant Stig set off from the Top Gear track at Dunsfold Park in Surrey for its trip across Europe . The nine-metre tall statue, pictured was commissioned to coincide with the Polish launch of BBC Brit . The statue will call into Amsterdam and Berlin during its three-day journey to Poland . The channel will launch in Poland on February 1 and Top Gear will be among the programmes it broadcasts, with many shows being screened the same day they are shown in the UK. The mysterious Stig - who wears a mirrored visor to protect his identity - is more usually seen hurtling around a track at breakneck speeds, and the statue copies his familiar pose with crossed-arms. During its three-day journey, the fibreglass sculpture will also call in at Amsterdam in the Netherlands and Berlin in Germany. The effigy set off on its journey just hours before viewers saw the real Stig and Top Gear presenters launch the new BBC2 series, with a race across St Petersburg in last night's edition. Amanda Hill, the chief brands officer for BBC Worldwide which is behind the channel launch, said: 'BBC Brit will be the new home of Top Gear in Poland so what better way to mark this than by taking them a giant Stig. Fans will be able to spot him on the roads of England, Holland and Germany, he's impossible to miss.'

"Lisa Swinton McLaughlin, 56,  gave birth by cesarean section  to sons Jordan and Dylan . A new mom died seven days after giving birth to twins following more than 30 years of longing to have children. Lisa Swinton McLaughlin, 56, who lived in Baltimore, Maryland, gave birth by cesarean section on December 27 to sons, Jordan and Dylan. But she died on January 4 from a bowel obstruction - she had been in pain, but thought it was the result of the incision. Her husband Mike McLaughlin, 67, a retiree, has not only lost his wife, but he must now face raising their two sons alone, reports Omaha.com. He says Mrs McLaughlin who was medical director for the American Red Cross in Baltimore, Maryland, had longed for children for the past 30 years. The couple spent a decade trying different types of fertility treatments and were delighted when Mrs McLaughlin became pregnant last year. She developed gestational diabetes during the pregnancy, but it was monitored closely by her doctors. In December she started bed rest because the size of one twin was causing a blood-flow problem. And on December 27, she gave birth by cesarean section to Jordan, three pounds and three ounces, and Dylan, three pounds. 'She was just on cloud nine,' Mr McLaughlin said. 'That's the happiest I've probably seen her in my life.' 'She wanted what every other woman had, and that’s children.' They were premature, but the boys were healthy and thrived in the neonatal intensive care unit. Although she was in significant pain, Mrs McLaughlin went home on New Year's Eve - a few days later she died. 'She held the babies and was able to stroke them and love them,' her husband said. Mr McLaughlin is hoping the twins will be able to come home soon - they both weigh four pounds. He has hired a nanny to help take care of them and eventually plans to move home to Nebraska, where his son, other family members and friends can help out.","Lisa Swinton McLaughlin, 56, gave birth by cesarean section on December 27 to sons, Jordan and Dylan .

"Two police officers could face criminal charges after being accused of calling a teenage abuse victim a 'f***ing slag' and 'b**ch' in a foul-mouthed voicemail. Alex Faragher, 19, from Sutton Coldfield said hearing the abuse in a message mistakenly left by the male West Midlands Police officers felt like being assaulted all over again. In the two-minute recording left while they were trying to contact the victim so she could make a statement, PC Cavan O'Connell, 48, is allegedly heard talking to another officer in his late 20s. Scroll down for audio . Alex Faragher, 19, said hearing the abuse in a message mistakenly left by the male West Midlands Police officers felt like being assaulted all over again and appealed the results of police investigation . One of the officers said: 'F***ing b**ch, I specifically said, 'You are not going to give us the runaround are you?'. 'No, I want to press charges,' she said. F***ing slag.' A second officer then referred to falsifying Faragher's witness statement because they couldn't get hold of her. He could be heard saying: 'Either that or the only other thing we do is go back, f***ing draft the statement ourselves and then just get the b**ch to sign it.' The force completed an internal investigation into the incident which involved PC O'Connell, 48, and a long-term colleague and shared the findings with Ms Faragher. She had called the  police after an altercation with her boyfriend Dean Hannon, 19 (pictured) and was left the message when the officers came round to take her victim statement . But the 19-year-old appealed the decision and took the case to the Independent Police Complaints Commission who have upheld her complaint and referred it to the Crown Prosecution Service. The CPS will now decide if the officers, who remain on restricted duties, should face criminal charges. Speaking at the time, the wedding caterer said: 'When I heard the voicemail I was shellshocked. 'It is very serious and I can't believe they would consider writing my witness statement for me. It's horrifying. I feel so sick and upset at the thought of it. 'What if this had been a rape victim and these kinds of comments were being used? 'What kind of police practice is this? I have lost all faith completely. What happens if I need the police now? I wouldn't want to ring them. Ms Faragher's correspondence (both pictures) with police which documents the details of the incident . 'They can't be trusted. What the officers said was so hurtful, It was like being assaulted all over again, verbally assaulted, just after I had been through a stressful ordeal. 'The policemen verbally assaulted me. It's disgusting and I feel victimised and humiliated. 'I feel sure if a female officer was in the car I wouldn't have been referred to as a b**ch. It is so disrespectful and the police are meant to be in a position of trust and to help, not cause more harm. 'The voicemail made me feel angry. I only heard a short bit of the conversation but God knows what else they said about me after the recording stopped. 'The police, who are meant to help and make things better have belittled me and made me feel worthless.' She had called the police at 5.30pm after an altercation with her boyfriend Dean Hannon, 19, and he was arrested.

The caterer said the police told her they would come back at 6pm to take her witness statement and she informed them she was going to her dad's house at 6.30pm. 'I waited for them to turn up but they didn't show. At 6.30pm I went to my dad's and later on I arranged to go to Sutton Coldfield police station to give my statement at 11pm,' she said. 'When I finally gave my statement, I wasn't given a proper chance to look through it. I struggle with dyslexia when they read it back, parts were wrong but they didn't get changed. 'I didn't hear the voicemail until after I had given the statement at 11pm, and it was clear the policemen just wanted to get the job done, that's why they were taking about writing my statement for me. The allegation of gross misconduct in January last year was originally referred to the IPCC after the complaint was made. The IPCC then determined that the complaint should be investigated by West Midlands Police Professional Standards Department. This investigation has now been completed and Ms Faragher has appealed the decision, which has now been passed from the IPCC to the CPS. A spokeswoman for West Midlands Police said: 'The complaint has been thoroughly investigated by the force's Professional Standards Department and the findings have been shared with the complainant. 'However, some of the findings were subject of an appeal to the IPCC who upheld the appeal and recommended the case be referred to the CPS. The CPS investigation is currently underway. The officers involved remain on restricted duties.' Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Message was mistakenly left on the mobile phone of Alex Faragher, 19 .

"From edge-to-edge, Saturn's ring system would be too big to fit in the distance between Earth and the moon. But now a new ring system has been found that dwarfs Saturn's enormous structure – and it's the first of its kind to be seen outside our solar system. Astronomers discovered more than 30 rings eclipsing the very young sun-like star J1407, each of them tens of millions of miles in diameter. Scroll down for video . Astronomers have discovered more than 30 rings eclipsing the very young sun-like star J1407, each of them tens of millions of miles in diameter. There are gaps in the rings, which indicate that exomoons may have formed. Pictured is an artist's impression by www.black-cat-studios.com . The rings were first spotted in 2012 by the Leiden Observatory in the Netherlands, and the University of Rochester in New York. A new analysis of the data, led by Leiden's Matthew Kenworthy, shows that there are gaps in the rings, which indicate that exomoons may have formed in the space. 'The details that we see in the light curve are incredible,' said Professor Kenworthy. 'The eclipse lasted for several weeks, but you see rapid changes on time scales of tens of minutes as a result of fine structures in the rings. 'The star is much too far away to observe the rings directly, but we could make a detailed model based on the rapid brightness variations in the star light passing through the ring system. 'If we could replace Saturn's rings with the rings around J1407b, they would be easily visible at night and be many times larger than the full moon.' From edge-to-edge, Saturn's ring system (pictured here by the Cassini probe) would be too big to fit in the distance between Earth and the moon. But now a new ring system has been found that dwarfs Saturn's enormous structure – and it's the first of its kind outside our solar system . The astronomers analysed data from the Superwasp project – a survey that is designed to detect gas giants that move in front of their parent star. Their conclusions is that the companion is likely to be a giant planet – not yet seen – with a gigantic ring system responsible for the repeated dimming of J1407's light. The star is similar in mass to the sun, but is much younger. Astronomers believe it to be about 16 million years old or 1/300th the age of the solar system. It lies about 420 light years away. There are more than 30 rings eclipsing the very young sun-like star. Each of these rings tens of millions of miles in diameter. If we could replace Saturn's rings with the rings around J1407b, they would be easily visible at night. The mass of J1407b is most likely in the range of about 10 to 40 Jupiter masses. The researchers encourage amateur astronomers to help monitor J1407. They want to detect the next eclipse of the rings, to find out the definite mass of the ringed companion. The light curve tells astronomers that the diameter of the ring system is nearly 120 million kilometers, more than two hundred times as large as the rings of Saturn. The ring system, 420 light years from Earth, likely contains roughly an Earth's worth of mass in light-obscuring dust particles. Professor Eric Mamajek puts into context how much material is contained in these disks and rings. 'If you were to grind up the four large Galilean moons of Jupiter into dust and ice and spread out the material over their orbits in a ring around Jupiter, the ring would be so opaque to light that a distant observer that saw the ring pass in front of the sun would see a very deep, multi-day eclipse,' he said. 'In the case of J1407, we see the rings blocking as much as 95 per cent of the light of this young sun-like star for days, so there is a lot of material there that could then form satellites.' In the data the astronomers found at least one clean gap in the ring structure, which is more clearly defined in the new model. 'One obvious explanation is that a satellite formed and carved out this gap,' said Professor Kenworthy. 'The mass of the satellite could be between that of Earth and Mars. The satellite would have an orbital period of approximately two years around J1407b.' Astronomers expect that the rings will become thinner in the next several million years and eventually disappear as satellites form from the material in the disks. 'The planetary science community has theorised for decades that planets like Jupiter and Saturn would have had, at an early stage, disks around them that then led to the formation of satellites,' Professor Mamajek explains. 'However, until we discovered this object in 2012, no-one had seen such a ring system. This is the first snapshot of satellite formation on million-kilometer scales around a substellar object.' Astronomers estimate that the ringed companion J1407b has an orbital period roughly a decade in length. The mass of J1407b has been difficult to determine, but it is most likely in the range of about 10 to 40 Jupiter masses. The researchers encourage amateur astronomers to help monitor J1407, which would help detect the next eclipse of the rings, and constrain the period and mass of the ringed companion. Professor Kenworthy adds that finding eclipses from more objects like J1407's companion 'is the only feasible way we have of observing the early conditions of satellite formation for the near future. 'J1407's eclipses will allow us to study the physical and chemical properties of satellite-spawning circumplanetary disks.' 'The details that we see in the light curve are incredible,' said Professor Kenworthy. 'The eclipse lasted for several weeks, but you see rapid changes on time scales of tens of minutes as a result of fine structures'","The massive rings were seen eclipsing the  young sun-like star J1407 .

"Language: Tarik Kafala, who runs BBC Arabic, said the term 'terrorist' was too 'loaded' and 'value-laden' to describe Charlie Hebdo killers Said and Cherif Kouachi and their accomplice Amedy Coulibaly . The BBC was branded ‘mad’ yesterday after a top executive said the Charlie Hebdo killers should not be described as ‘terrorists’. Tarik Kafala, head of BBC Arabic, said the term terrorist was too ‘loaded’ and ‘value-laden’ to describe the fanatics who murdered 12 people at the French satirical magazine. The BBC backed his comments but faced a storm of criticism. Lord Tebbit said the only things ‘loaded’ were the killers’ weapons. ‘I think the BBC would be well advised to look at the Oxford English Dictionary or any other good dictionary’s definition of terrorism,’ he said. The Tory peer, whose wife was left paralysed by the IRA’s Brighton bomb 31 years ago, added: ‘I find it strange that the BBC should be trying to hide the nature of these people ... They are as mad as rats, aren’t they?’ BBC coverage of the atrocities in Paris, and the Taliban school massacre in Peshawar, Pakistan, last month, studiously avoided using the word ‘terrorist’, except when quoting other people, in line with its editorial guidelines. Instead TV, radio and online reports described the murderers who carried out the attacks as ‘militants’ or ‘gunmen’. Mr Kafala, whose licence-fee-funded TV, radio and online news services reach 36million worldwide every week, told The Independent: ‘We try to avoid describing anyone as a terrorist or an act as being terrorist. 'What we try to do is to say that “two men killed 12 people in an attack on the office of a satirical magazine”. That’s enough, we know what that means and what it is. ‘Terrorism is such a loaded word. We know what murder, bombings and shootings are, and we describe them. 'That’s much more revealing, we believe, than using a word like terrorist which people will see as value-laden.’ Last night Tory MP Peter Bone said: ‘I’ve heard of political correctness but even by the BBC’s standards that’s outrageous. Scroll down for video . Killers: The Kouachi brothers, Cherif, left, and Said, right, shot dead 12 at the offices of satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo in Paris two weeks ago before being killed themselves after going on the run . Terrorist: Amedy Coulibaly killed four at a Kosher deli after shooting dead a policewoman and was a member of the same terror cell . 'It gives succour to terrorists, to give any credence to the idea that there is any justification whatsoever. The BBC has completely lost its sense.’ Fellow Conservative MP Conor Burns, who sits on the culture, media and sport select committee, added: ‘It is yet another example of Orwellian “1984” use of language by the BBC which serves to mask rather than illuminate.’ Professor Anthony Glees, director of the Centre for Security and Intelligence Studies at the University of Buckingham, said: ‘Pulling this particular punch over terrorism is so serious that this man needs to consider his position. 'And the BBC needs to ask itself whether this view inspires confidence in its reporting or does the opposite.’ Lord Tebbit (left) said the only things ‘loaded’ were the killers’ weapons and said the BBC 'would be well advised to look at the Oxford English Dictionary.' Tory MP Peter Bone (right) also said it was 'outrageous' BBC reporters are not banned from using words they deem appropriate but are asked to use their judgment. Editorial guidelines say the word ‘terrorist’ should be avoided unless quoting someone else. The guidelines also state: ‘We recognise the existence and the reality of terrorism ... ‘We have learnt from the experience of covering such events in Northern Ireland as much as in Israel, Spain, Russia, Southern Africa or the many other places where violence divides communities, and where we seek to be seen as objective by all sides, that labels applied to groups can sometimes hinder rather than help.’ A BBC spokesman said: ‘There is no BBC ban on the word “terrorist”, as can be seen from our reporting of the terrorist attack in Paris, though we prefer a more precise description if possible. ‘The head of BBC Arabic was simply reflecting BBC editorial guidelines and making a general point about the nuances of broadcasting internationally.’ The BBC's exhaustive editorial guidelines run over 215 pages and contains guidance on all areas of its coverage including violence, swearing and nudity. And it appears that  Tarik Kafala, who runs BBC Arabic and said the term 'terrorist' was too 'loaded' to use, is just following orders. The BBC's guidance says: 'We must report acts of terror quickly, accurately, fully and responsibly. Terrorism is a difficult and emotive subject with significant political overtones and care is required in the use of language that carries value judgements. 'We try to avoid the use of the term ""terrorist"" without attribution. When we do use the term we should strive to do so with consistency in the stories we report across all our services and in a way that does not undermine our reputation for objectivity and accuracy. 'The word ""terrorist"" itself can be a barrier rather than an aid to understanding. We should convey to our audience the full consequences of the act by describing what happened. 'We should use words which specifically describe the perpetrator such as ""bomber"", ""attacker"", ""gunman"", ""kidnapper"", ""insurgent"", and ""militant"". We should not adopt other people's language as our own; our responsibility is to remain objective and report in ways that enable our audiences to make their own assessments about who is doing what to whom'.","Head of BBC Arabic Tarik Kafala says term 'terrorist' is too 'loaded' to use .

"A sheriff's deputy had a close encounter with some bears during a recent vehicle inspection in a California forest. The incident involving Ricky Hernandez, a deputy for the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, took place Sunday at Angeles National Forest's Chantry Flat recreation area, KABC reported. A bear was observed by Hernandez's helicopter team  while the deputy was being dropped so he could examine a vehicle, according to the television station. Scroll down for video . Deputy: Ricky Hernandez, a deputy for the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, had a close encounter with some bears during a recent vehicle inspection in a California forest . Ricky Hernandez's team observed a bear on the ground while the deputy was being dropped out of a helicopter so he could examine a vehicle that had been deserted . The team members' attempts to alert Hernandez to the bear failed because they 'lost radio contact,' KABC reported. The bear sped into the forest since it was scared of the helicopter, according to the affiliate station. Still, Hernandez was in for a shock when he peered inside the car Sunday and came face to face with some bear cubs that had made themselves at home. 'The vehicle was all torn up,' Hernandez told KABC. 'All the headliners and the upholstery and everything was all cut up and made into like a nest, and - so I entered the vehicle, I crawled into it. 'It was up on its roof. When I got inside, I noticed two bear cubs, or three bear cubs, inside there.' He told the affiliate station the car did not contain any human remains. Hernandez was removed by deputies following a short probe, according to KABC.

"Ed Miliband today came under pressure from his own MPs to lurch left in the wake of the victory for an anti-austerity party in Greece. Senior Labour politicians hailed the 'exciting' victory for the left and demanded an end to 'savage cuts', piling pressure on Ed Miliband to oppose more spending cuts. And Green MEPs said the win by the left-wing Syriza party result  'marks the beginnings of ordinary people standing up to a discredited economic model'. But Tory Chancellor George Osborne warned against 'returning to economic chaos', insisting a change in direction would lead to higher unemployment. Scroll down for video . Senior Labour politicians hailed the 'exciting' victory for the left and demanded an end to 'savage cuts', piling pressure on Ed Miliband to oppose more spending cuts . Green MP Caroline Lucas said she had been 'inspired' by the 'huge vote' for Syriza while former Labour Cabinet minister Peter Hain, a close ally of Ed Miliband, hit out at the impact of 'savage cuts' Syriza leader Alexis Tsipras swept to victory overnight on a promise to renegotiate Greece's €240billion (£179bn) international bailout deal. He has also pledged to reverse many of the reforms that EU creditors demanded in exchange for keeping Greece financially afloat since 2010. That has placed the country on a collision course with Germany over its massive bailout deal, with Angela Merkel effectively saying the new Greek government can forget any kind of debt relief. The 40-year-old was sworn in this afternoon, making him the youngest Greek Prime Minister for more than 150 years. With 101 days until the general election in the UK, the result has been hailed by left-wing parties in who hope it will bolster their call to reverse the efforts to tackle nation's deficit. Reacting to the result today, Mr Miliband sought to distance himself from events in Greece: 'Just like our elections are a matter for the people of this country, so who the Greek people elect is a decision for them. 'It is the responsibility of the British government to work with the elected government of Greece for the good of Britain and Europe and not to play politics. 'And it is up to each country to choose its own path on how to deal with the economic and social challenges they face. 'We have set out our path for Britain: to make sure our country is fairer and more prosperous and balance the books.' But veteran leftwing Labour MP John McDonnell said the Syriza 'points the way to ending the era of austerity across Europe'. He added: 'Nobody should underestimate the anger and the demand for change here.' Former Labour Cabinet minister Peter Hain, a close ally of Ed Miliband, declared: 'Fantastic Syriza win: austerity does not work for Greece, for Tory/Lib Dem UK, nor for EU; we all need investment in growth not savage cuts.' Former Labour Cabinet minister Peter Hain, a close ally of Ed Miliband, posted this message on Twitter after the result was announced . Veteran leftwing Labour MP John McDonnell said the Syrica 'points the way to ending the era of austerity across Europe' Chris Williamson, Labour MP for Derby North, said he was 'delighted' with the result in Greece . More than a dozen Labour MPs have called on Ed Miliband to lurch left, in the wake of the election victory secured by Syriza in Greece. A letter signed by 16 MPs calls for an end to 'prolonged austerity', nationalisation of the railways and  a return to collective bargaining and employment rights in the workplace. Labour MP Michael Meacher  told LabourList: 'Jobs and growth are vitally needed rather than prolonged austerity as the best means both to cut the deficit fastest and to give hope to our people. 'Public ownership is urgently needed to reverse failed privatisations, and the railways should lead the way to a new perspective of the crucial role of the public sector. 'And an enhanced role for the trade unions is strongly needed both to promote economic partnership in our workplaces and to reverse the extreme inequality now so badly disfiguring our society'. Among the MPs who have backed the letter are Diane Abbott, John McDonnell, Chris Williamson, Katy Clark and Linda Riordan. Chris Williamson, Labour MP for Derby North, said he was 'delighted' with the result in Greece, adding: 'Austerity con that's increased poverty and made super-rich even richer has been dealt a severe blow.' George Aylett, Labour candidate in South West Wiltshire, said austerity does not work and was 'punishing the poor for the mistakes made by the rich'. Harry Leslie Smith, wrote on Twitter: 'With Syriza election win Greece has lit the way for the rest of Europe's battle against neo con austerity.' Louise Haigh, a Labour candidate in Sheffield Heeley, said:' 'A major victory for the left and in fight against austerity, very exciting.' The Green party, which has called for an end to austerity, predicted the Greek result would be repeated in the UK . Green MP Caroline Lucas said she had been 'inspired' by the 'huge vote' for Syriza. 'Now EU must listen to people & economists & respond with debt forgivenesss & support,' she wrote on Twitter. Green MEPs Scott Cato and Keith Taylor also called for an anti-austerity revolution in Britain. 'Greens share the view of the new government that austerity is a failed model which has piled misery on the poorest while making the wealthiest even richer,' they said in a statement. They added: 'This result shows that challenging business as usual politics can win the support of the people. 'In the UK we are witnessing a Green Surge, in no small part due to our anti-austerity agenda, and we hope the Greek election result marks the beginnings of ordinary people standing up to a discredited economic model and failing Governments across Europe.' The Green party manifesto promises policy to give everyone in the country a 'basic citizen's income' of £72 a week regardless of wealth - at a staggering cost to the country of £280billion. The party also backs zero economic growth and falling levels of personal consumption and wealth as a way of protecting the environment. Green MP Caroline Lucas said she had been 'inspired' by the 'huge vote' for Syriza . Prime Minister David Cameron warned the result will 'increase economic across Europe' and vowed to stick to his austerity programme . But the UK government insisted that diverting from the plan to reduce spending cuts would lead to economic chaos. Mr Osborne said relying on spending more money to get out of difficulties was a 'panacea, false hope'. 'Ultimately, if you take at face value all the things that the new Greek government has promised, including new big increases in public expenditure, I think that is going to be very difficult to deliver and incompatible with what the eurozone currently demands of its members,' he said. 'But I hope that both sides now act responsibly. 'Everyone has in the past looked over the precipice of Greek exit from the euro and pulled back. It is certainly in the UK's interest that we have stability, that we have proper dialogue here between members of the euro. 'But ultimately what the UK needs is a strong partner, and the institutions of the eurozone are not working well enough for the people of Europe, and that has an impact on us.' Conservative MP Julian Smith MP said: 'Syriza will increase economic uncertainty across Europe, Ed Miliband wants to do exactly the same thing in the UK. 'Britain currently has a long-term economic plan that works wile Ed Miliband offers only chaos and confusion. 'In fact the views of many of Labour MPs wouldn't be out of place in Syriza. 'One thing that's certain is Ed Miliband is a weak leader who isn't respected by his own MPs.'","Labour MPs hail left's 'exciting' victory and demand end to 'savage cuts'

"As well as dealing with the gruelling rounds of treatment and the emotional impact of a cancer diagnosis, for many of the 2.5 million sufferers, the disease's impact on appearance is often a worry, too. Half of patients don't ask  their doctor about the possible side-effects of treatment on their physical appearance, according to research. And more than a third said this is because they didn't feel it was 'appropriate'. In response to this, Boots UK and Macmillan Cancer Support have trained pharmacists and beauty advisers to provide additional support, from the personal to practical, to cancer patients. Boots and Macmillan Cancer Support have trained pharmacists and beauty advisers to provide support, tips and make-up demonstrations for cancer patients . They are able to offer important advice on loss of hair, eyebrows and eyelashes, dry or sensitive skin and brittle nails to help people feel more like themselves. Charlotte Goodacre, a Boots Macmillan Beauty Adviser from Plymouth, has first-hand experience of the positive impact the role has had on a women in her local area. She said: 'I recently helped a lady learn how to apply make up in the right way following treatment, and when she returned home her husband and son cried as they were so overwhelmed at how well she looked. 'They came in store to thank me personally for making a difference to her self-esteem and confidence. 'It is when you hear stories like this you realise why it is important to make sure that people affected by cancer are receiving the everyday support - no matter how big or small - that is going to make a real difference to their lives.' Joanne Taylor, who was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2011 and had six months of chemo, a single mastectomy and 20 rounds of radiotherapy, found comfort in the beauty consultations . If she had a down day, Joanne would treat herself to a pampering session and said she can't stress enough that feeling pretty again helped her feel so much better . Three years on, Joanne's not only in remission, left, and back to her old, energetic self, she also wants to help others going through the same experience.

But, three years on, Joanne’s not only in remission and back to her old, energetic self, she also wants to help others going through the same experience by explaining what services she experienced on the high-street. If she was feeling low, Joanne would treat herself to a pampering session. She said: 'If I had a down day, I can’t stress enough that feeling pretty again helped me feel so much better: putting on make-up and accessories, painting my nails, pencilling in my eyebrows and experimenting with eyeshadow (as I’d lost my lashes and eyebrows). 'I went along and it was great to talk to other women in my situation about everything from skincare and make-up to hair loss. 'I learnt all the skills from my Boots Macmillan Beauty Advisers who were really helpful and there to talk about my visible side effects of treatment and help boost my self-confidence.' The beauty advisers are able to offer important advice on loss of hair, eyebrows and eyelashes, dry or sensitive skin and brittle nails to help people feel more like themselves . Cancer treatment can cause more than hair loss; it can affect your skin, too.

"Vice President Joe Biden will today admit that he was bored during Barack Obama's delivery of the State of the Union address in an appearance on the Ellen DeGeneres show centered on plugging Obamacare legislation. Biden, who also wished his host a happy 57th birthday in the pre-filmed segment, said he had to feign interest on camera in the pivotal presidential address. He compared his actions during Obama's speech to Congress last week to those of a loyal wife who must 'pretend to be interested' while her husband waxes lyrical. Star guest: The Vice President surprised Ellen DeGeneres in her Los Angeles studio - and gave her a White House-branded bath robe as a 57th birthday present . The real reason: Biden then revealed he was actually on the show to lecture the audience about Obamacare, and give a detailed rundown of how they can sign up . Biden made the revelation while explaining an anecdote from his wife Jill, who said she gets the precise feeling of having heard it all before when she listens to him speak. He told DeGeneres: 'You know I sit back there and I listen and I help write the ideas in the speech and I know it all... I got to pay attention. 'And she [Jill Biden] said, welcome to the club. And I said what do you mean? She said, welcome to the Good Wife’s Club. 'She said, how many times have I sat and listened to you make a speech and pretend to be interested?' 'Good wife's club': Biden, pictured behind Barack Obama during the address on Capitol Hill, said he feigned interest while Obama spoke . On the subject of his wife, DeGeneres took the opportunity to press him on their Valentine's Day plans. But the Vice President only said he had 'a lot' in store for her, and declined to elaborate. After the tease, Biden used most of his remaining screentime to tell those watching to get on board with the Obama administration's flagship health reforms. Making no secret of his intention, Biden said he wanted to use the TV spot to reach Ellen's audience of mothers and young people to encourage them to get state-mandated health insurance. DeGeneres then gave him permission to talk through each sign-up method in turn, and said she would help spread the word via her website. Biden admitted that the chance to plug Obamacare was the real reason he made the trip to DeGeneres's Los Angeles studios - but did also bring a gift for his host, albeit of a political kind. Presenting her with a White House-branded bathrobe, he suggested she could wear it next year when Obama makes another State of the Union address. He said: 'You talked about watching the State of The Union and watching me stand up. Now next year when you watch it I want you to be able to be comfortable. I brought you a bathrobe with the White House Seal on it. A gift to Ellen from Joe, so you’re comfortable.'","Vice President surprised chat show host and gave her a present .

"Frustrated commuters faced fresh travel misery today thanks to a signal failure outside London Waterloo and flooding in tunnels between St Pancras and Farringdon. Flooding from the burst water main has left Thameslink unable to run any trains between Farringdon and London St Pancras International until at least the end of today’s service. Thames Water is working to stop the massive leak and Network Rail said it has pumped out more than 300,000 litres of water after the water main ruptured Friday and continued to flood the tunnels over the weekend. Scroll down for video . Flooding from a burst main has left Thameslink unable to run trains between Farringdon and St Pancras . Network Rail has pumped out more than 300,000 litres of water since the water main burst on Friday . Thameslink operator Govia said around 50,000 litres of water remained in the tunnel yesterday and full train service will not resume until it is cleared and the safety equipment and infrastructure are inspected. A reduced service is in place on the Thameslink line, which runs 140 miles from Bedford to Brighton. Commuters have been forced to switch to buses or alternative train services to get to work as some trips have been delayed by up to an hour. Thameslink said service between Farringdon and St Pancras will not resume until the water is pumped out . Thameslink has apologised to passengers for the service disruption which began last week . Meanwhile South West Trains were disrupted through the morning commute due to the signal failure outside London Waterloo, one of the country’s busiest railway stations. It led to delays for the second Monday in a row. Normal serviced resume at about 10am. A signalling problem at London Liverpool Street and a broken-down train at Gidea Park also caused delays of up 30 minutes to trains between London Liverpool Street and Shenfield in Essex. Commuters suffered delays and disruption every day last week because of signalling problems and broken-down trains. Passengers have been stuck in long queues due to the disruption between Farringdon and St Pancras . The disruption involving Thameslink trains has put stress on other services and led to additional delays . Mick Cash, general secretary of the Rail, Maritime and Transport union, said that after last week’s ‘dire failures on Britain’s privatised railways’, there had now been wholesale cancellations on the basket-case Thameslink franchise, leaving thousands of passengers stranded in the cold. He said: ‘There can be no more excuses from government officials. Their privatised and fragmented rail system leaves the British paying the highest fares in Europe to travel on clapped-out and unreliable services. ‘Two decades of profiteering and under-investment has reduced our railways to chaos.’ A fault affecting live train information across the rail network compounded commuters’ misery, leaving passengers struggling to track services amid the delays. A signalling problem at London Bridge caused delays of up to 20 minutes to Southern services to and from the station, with no firm estimate of how long the disruption will last.","Thameslink unable to run trains between Farringdon and St Pancras .

"The number of young women diagnosed with cervical cancer has soared in the last decade, as new figures reveal more than one million failed to attend smear tests last year. Over the last 10 years, cases of the disease in women aged 25 to 29 have soared by 59.2 per cent. Meanwhile in the last year rates have risen 4.8 per cent, as one million women failed to attend smear test appointments. Eight women in the UK are diagnosed each day and cervical cancer is the most common form of the disease in under 35s. A leading charity is today urging women to ensure they attend their regular smear tests, raising concerns that the uptake of screening has fallen to an all-time low. While some women admit they are too embarrassed to go for screening tests, others said they are concerned it will be painful, while some said they don't think the tests are necessary. Scroll down for video . Jo's Cervical Cancer Trust has today launched the #SmearForSmear campaign to encourage more women to make sure they attend regular smear tests . The campaign, launched at the start of Cervical Cancer Prevention Week, comes as new figures reveal the number of women aged 25 to 35 with the disease has soared in the last decade, while one million women missed their smear test appointments last year . Jo's Cervical Cancer Trust said in the last year 33.7 per cent of 25 to 29 year olds failed to have their scheduled smear test, while 22.3 per cent of 30 to 34 year olds missed their appointment. Across the UK more than one in five of all women invited for screening fails to attend, with uptake falling below 78 per cent (77.8 per cent) for the first time in more than 20 years. Among women aged 25 to 29 smear test uptake has fallen from 78 per cent in 1999 to 66.3 per cent last year. Figures from the Office for National Statistics shows the number of women aged under 35 and diagnosed with the disease in England rose by 3.98 per cent in the last year, and 33.1 per cent over the last 10 years. To mark Cervical Cancer Prevention Week, this week, Jo's Cervical Cancer Trust is urging the public to join their #SmearForSmear social media campaign. Raising awareness of the importance of regular screening, the campaign encourages people to help stop the rise in the number of women diagnosed with the disease. A survey by the charity found 20 per cent of young women believe cervical screening tests are unnecessary, while 26.2 per cent are put off having a smear over concerns it will be painful. Across the UK more than one in five of all women invited for screening fails to attend, with uptake falling below 78 per cent (77.8 per cent) for the first time in more than 20 years. Maddy and Fran from the charity take part and show their support for the #SmearForSmear campaign . Meanwhile 26.6 per cent refuse the life-saving test, letting their embarrassment get the better of them. The charity has also raised concerns over a lack of knowledge with more than half of young women unable to identify the cause of cervical cancer as the human papillomavirus (HPV). One in 10 women believe smear tests detect sexually transmitted infections, while 13.5 per cent thought it was a test for ovarian cancer. The charity's chief executive Robin Music, said screening remains the best preventative measure in combating the disease. 1. Put on your lipstick . 2. Smear your lipstick and take a selfie . 3.

'Every day we see the devastating impact a cervical cancer diagnosis can have on both a woman and her loved ones,' he said. 'But to know that for those that delayed their screening before diagnosis, this could have been prevented, is tragic. 'It's now time that we see an upward shift in awareness of cervical cancer and an understanding of the importance of smear tests.' Professor Julietta Patnick, Director of the NHS Cancer Screening Programmes, managed by Public Health England (PHE), said: 'It is evident that women in this younger age group still need encouragement to be screened and PHE is working hard to address this with research underway to investigate new ways of improving cervical screening uptake among younger women. 'Regular attendance at screening remains the top preventative measure against cervical cancer and we would encourage all women to make the decision to attend when invited.' Mr Music added: 'We hope the public get fully behind this fun and simple campaign. 'The more women who take this life saving five minute test, the fewer who will face infertility, early menopause, more extensive long term effects and potentially even loss of life. 'It's time we all acted as it may just save a life.' The NHS offers a free cervical screening test to all women aged 25-64 every three to five years. It is not a test for cervical cancer, but it identifies early abnormalities which, if left untreated, could develop into cancer of the cervix (neck of the womb). A sample of cells is taken from the cervix for analysis and sent to a laboratory for analysis. Those whose cells show abnormalities are called back for further investigation and, if necessary, treatment. Currently the test is not offered routinely to women aged younger than 25 because cervical cancer is so rare in women that young. According to Cancer Research UK statistics, not a single woman under the age of 20 died from cervical cancer between 2009-2011. The NHS offers free cervical screening tests to all women aged 25 to 64 every three to five years. The test detects early abnormalities which, if left untreated, can develop into cancer of the cervix, pictured . The lower age of 25 was raised from 20 after the Advisory Committee on Cervical Cancer Screening (ACCS) advised the NHS in 2003 that cervical screening in younger women did more harm than good. The committee advised that cell abnormalities in younger women normally went away of their own accord, and said that sending young women for further tests and treatment increased the likelihood of the woman having pre-term delivery if she went on to have children, and could cause significant anxiety. Many other countries offer cervical screening from the age of 25, including Italy, France, Belgium and Ireland. In Scotland, women are invited to be checked from the age of 20, though it is due to go up to 25 next year. In Australia women are invited from 18, Greece from 20, and in the US two years after women become sexually active. Meanwhile, other countries start cervical screening later. Both the Netherlands and Finland offer screening to women only once they are 30, and these two countries boast some of the lowest mortality rates for cervical cancer in Europe, and in Bulgaria it is for women over 31.","In the last 10 years the number of 25 to 29-year-old women diagnosed with cervical cancer has soared by 59.2% - 4.9% in the last year .

"The largest glacier in East Antarctica is melting due to warm ocean water, according to Australian scientists. Until recently, the 74-mile-long (120km) Totten Glacier was  thought to be surrounded by cold waters and therefore very stable and unlikely to shrink. But now experts say that waters around the glacier  are warmer than expected and are probably melting the ice from below. Scroll down for video . Australian scientists say that waters around Totten Glacier (pictured) which contains ice equivalent to a 20ft (six metre) rise in global sea levels, are warmer than expected and are probably melting the ice form below . Scientists believe the glacier contains enough water to cause a 20ft (six-metre) rise in global sea levels if it melted entirely. 'We knew that the glacier was thinning from the satellite data, and we didn't know why,’ Steve Rintoul, the voyage's chief scientist told AFP. The expedition found that waters around the glacier, which is 18 miles (30km) wide, were 1.5 °C warmer than other areas visited on the same trip during the southern hemisphere summer. ‘We made it to the front of the glacier and we measured temperatures that were warm enough to drive significant melt,’ Dr Rintoul said. ‘And so the fact that warm water can reach this glacier is a sign that East Antarctica is potentially more vulnerable to changes in the ocean driven by climate change than we used to think.’ The glacier, located in East Antarctica (marked on the map) was known to be thinning thanks to satellite images, but it is only now that scientists think they know why . Until recently, the 74 mile long (120km) glacier was thought to be surrounded by cold waters and therefore very stable and unlikely to change. A stock image of a  penguin strolling past the King Sejong Korean station in Antarctica is shown . Previous expeditions had been unable to get close to the glacier due to heavy ice, but Dr Rintoul said the weather had held for the Aurora Australis icebreaker and a team of scientists and technicians from the Australian Antarctic Division and other bodies to investigate. Dr Rintoul stressed that the glacier is not about to melt entirely overnight and cause a 20 ft rise in sea levels, but that research will help scientists predict how changes in ocean temperatures will impact on ice sheets. ‘This study is a step towards better understanding of exactly which parts of the ice sheets are vulnerable to ocean warming and that is the sort of information that we can then use to improve our predictions of future sea level rises,’ he said. ‘East Antarctica is not as protected from change as we use to think,’ he said. The melt rate of glaciers in the fastest-melting part of Antarctica has tripled over the past decade, analysis of the past 21 years showed in a report published last month. The Amundsen Sea has long been thought to be the weakest ice sheet in the West Antarctic. Last month a US study suggested the barren region is haemorrhaging ice at a rate triple that of a decade ago. Researchers believe that the melting of glaciers in West Antarctica may be irreversible. The Amundsen Sea (pictured) has long been thought to be the weakest ice sheet in the West Antarctic. Now, a new US study suggests the barren region is haemorrhaging ice at a rate triple that of a decade ago . The findings of the 21-year study by Nasa and the University of California, Irvine claim to provide the most accurate estimates yet of just how fast glaciers are melting in the Amundsen Sea Embayment. Scientists found the rate by taking radar, laser and satellite measurements of the glaciers' mass between 1992 and 2013.

'The mass loss of these glaciers is increasing at an amazing rate,' said scientist Isabella Velicogna, jointly of the University of California, Irvine and Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. 'Previous studies had suggested that this region is starting to change very dramatically since the 1990s, and we wanted to see how all the different techniques compared,' added lead author Tyler Utterley of UCI.","Totten Glacier was thought to be surrounded by cold waters .

"If you suffer persistent bouts of heartburn for three weeks or longer, it could be a sign of cancer . Suffering persistent bouts of heartburn for three weeks or longer could be a sign of cancer, experts warned today. A new Be Clear On Cancer campaign is urging people to visit their doctor if they regularly fall victim to the condition. The pain could indicate the symptoms of oesophageal or stomach cancer. It comes as a survey commissioned by Public Health England revealed just one in two people would visit their doctor if they had heartburn daily for three weeks or longer. Heartburn, also known as acid reflux, is a form of indigestion that occurs when acid and digestive juices flow back up from the stomach to the gullet, which doesn't have a protective lining, so it causes inflammation and pain. Early diagnosis of oesophageal or stomach cancer is crucial, improving the chances treatment will be successful. Around 67 per cent of people diagnosed with oesophago-gastric cancers at the earliest stage survive for at least five years. That figure falls to around three per cent for those diagnosed at the late stage. The new survey found 59 per cent of respondents did not know that heartburn could be a sign of cancer, with just 15 per cent saying they were certain it is a symptom. The campaign also urges people to be vigilant in understanding that another symptom is difficulty swallowing food. The survey revealed 70 per cent of people didn't know that food sticking in the throat could be a sign of cancer, and just 13 per cent of those surveyed said they were sure it is a sign. Latest figures released by Public Health England show around 12,900 people in England are diagnosed with oesophago-gastric cancers each year, with approximately 10,200 people dying from the diseases each year. Scroll down for video . This equates to 28 people dying from either oesophageal or stomach cancer each day. Oesophago-gastric cancers are the fourth and fifth most common cause of cancer death in men and women respectively. It has been estimated that around 950 lives could be saved in England each year if our survival rates for oesophago-gastric cancers matched the best in Europe. The UK, with the Netherlands, has the joint highest incidence rate of oesophageal cancer in males in the European Union and the highest incidence rate of oesophageal cancer in females in the European Union. This may be due to smoking, low consumption of fruit and vegetables over time, rising obesity levels and consuming alcohol on a regular basis. Of those diagnosed with oesophago-gastric cancers, more than nine out of 10 people are over the age of 50, making this the target age group for the campaign. A new Be Clear On Cancer campaign is today urging people who regularly suffer the condition to visit their doctor. It comes as a survey reveals just one in two people would consider seeing a GP over the condition . Baroness Gail Rebuck, Chair of Penguin Random House UK, lost her husband Philip Gould to oesophageal cancer three years ago. She said: 'I understand from personal experience the devastating impact that oesophageal cancer can have. Acid reflux, also known as heartburn, is the most frequent cause of indigestion in the UK. It happens when the valve at the lower end of the oesophagus is abnormally relaxed and allows the stomach's acidic contents to flow back or 'reflux' into the gullet. The acid, which wells up from the stomach to the throat, causes sharp acid and burning pains. The main symptom is a painful or burning sensation in the throat and chest, which can radiate to the back, and last for up to three or four hours. If a person suffers heartburn regularly it can cause permanent damage to the oesophagus, making it difficult and painful to swallow food. Some people are more prone to the condition, the risk increased with conditions including weight gain, hernias and pregnancy, heavy smoking and drinking. 'I lost my husband Philip Gould to this cancer in 2011 when he was just 61. 'I personally want to raise awareness of the symptoms and how important it is to go to the doctor if you have them. 'What we see from the statistics is the earlier the cancer is caught, the better the chances of survival.' Professor Kevin Fenton, National Director of Health and Wellbeing at Public Health England,said it is vital people are aware of the signs to look out for. 'People may be reluctant to visit their doctor about persistent heartburn, thinking that it's something they just have to live with,' he said. 'But heartburn most days for three weeks or more could be a sign of cancer. 'The earlier cancer is diagnosed, the higher the chance of survival. 'If we're to improve early diagnosis rates, we need to encourage people with symptoms to go to their doctor, which is what this latest Be Clear on Cancer campaign aims to do.' Sean Duffy, National Clinical Director for Cancer at NHS England said: 'Early diagnosis of cancer is absolutely critical to improving survival. 'Part of this is helping people understand what symptoms to look out for, which is why campaigns like this are so important. Experts have warned heartburn, also known as acid reflux - a form of indigestion - could indicate a patient is suffering oesophageal or stomach cancer, pictured . 'Patients with possible early signs and symptoms should visit their GP so where necessary they can be referred for tests, and treatment can start quickly. 'Early diagnosis is a key focus for us and will form part of the NHS's new five year strategy for cancer, currently being developed by an independent taskforce.' Professor Michael Griffin, Professor of Surgery, Northern Oesophago-gastric Unit, said: 'Around 10,200 people in England die from either oesophageal or stomach cancer each year. 'Earlier diagnosis makes curative treatment possible and could potentially save hundreds of lives. 'Cancer campaigns like this, which encourage people to speak to their doctor if they have heartburn most days for three weeks or more, are vital. 'You won't be wasting your doctor's time - you will either get reassurance that it isn't cancer, or if it is, you will have a better chance of successful treatment.' The four-week campaign will see adverts running nationally throughout England on TV, radio and in the press with events taking place at a number of shopping centres across the country.","New Be Clear On Cancer campaign today warns of regular heartburn .

"The 2020 general election could be the first when voting can be done online without having to visit a polling station. A panel chaired by Commons Speaker John Bercow said online voting should be an option for all voters within just five years. But he warned that concerns about electoral fraud and secrecy of the ballot need to be tackled before voters can be confident that the result will not be hijacked by hackers and fraudsters. Commons Speaker John Bercow said online voting should be an option for all voters within just five years . Supporters of internet voting in general elections claim it could help to engage young people, after a sharp fall in turnout. Barely half of 18-24-year-olds voted in the 2010 election, compared to almost three-quarters of the over-65s. Moves to make it possible to casting a ballot online in elections by 2020 would be complemented by changes in political education in schools in an effort to encourage young people to register to vote. In an interview for the BBC Radio 4's Can Democracy Work? series, Mr Bercow said there was a 'growing appetite for online voting'. He said: 'Now I don't mean by that that it will necessarily at any stage be compulsory to vote in that way, but I think that the notion that, if it can be established as secure and reliable people should have the option to vote online, will gain ground more and more and more.' The planned election in 2020 'could be the first election in which people have the opportunity - they're not under any obligation - to vote online'. Online voting has been in used in some countries around the world, but is not yet widespread . The Digital Democracy Commission, chaired by Mr Bercow, found that many people cannot understand why they could not vote online, particularly young people. 'People are used to doing their banking and other day-to-day activities online and many feel that they should also be able to vote in this way,' the report said. 'Some people said that the inconvenience of having to vote in person was off-putting and suggested that online voting would help to increase voter turnout.' However some people highlighted concerns 'about the security of online voting and the potential for cyber attacks and hacking'. Labour's shadow leader of the Commons, Angela Eagle, said: 'This report suggests some interesting ways to improve our democracy and help us meet the challenges of our modern age. It is right they should be considered. 'We have to do much more to demystify Parliament and facilitate public engagement in our political process. 'Labour is committed to piloting online voting to see if it can be done securely and affordably. We will also create a new democracy portal to draw together in one place all of the things you need to know before you vote, we will make it easier to register to vote and we will reform the scrutiny of legislation to formalise a role for the public and give a greater role to backbench MPs.' Turnout has fallen must steeply among 18-24-year-olds, according to research of elections dating back to 1964 . The report also recommended the creation of a website to allow the public to take part in Commons debates and crowd-source questions to pose to ministers. It said MPs who are unwell or have childcare responsibilities should be able to vote in the Commons electronically, without having to go into the Chamber. The Commission recommended ending restrictions on members of the public using mobile phones in the public galleries in the Commons and said the House should experiment with providing live social media coverage of debates. Moves to make it possible to casting a ballot online in elections by 2020 would be complemented by changes in political education in schools in an effort to encourage young people to register to vote. Mr Bercow said the idea of an online forum enabling members of the public to have their say in Commons debates was 'exciting'. 'For members of Parliament whilst conducting their debate, to be aware of and capable of responding to what people outside are saying, would at least start to fuse the two parts of the body politic,' he said. 'I don't know whether I would call it a chamber but the idea of there being potentially a simultaneous dialogue between chambers of Parliament and members of the public, seems to me not an idea to be afraid of at all. It's actually quite an exciting idea.'","John Bercow says web voting should be an option within just five years .

"They only welcomed their twins six weeks ago but Prince Albert II of Monaco and Princess Charlene showed no sign of suffering sleepless nights as they joined in the national celebrations for their patron saint. The royal couple, who welcomed Prince Jacques Honoré Rainier and Princess Gabriella Thérèse Marie in December, stole a kiss at the traditional remembrance service for St. Devote in Monaco on Monday evening. St Devote's Day is a national holiday in Monaco in remembrance of their patron saint. She was a Christan martyr who was killed and tortured for her faith in the 4th century. Prince Albert II of Monaco and his wife, Princess Charlene, shared an intimate moment as they joined in the national celebrations for their patron saint St Devote . Princess Charlene, 36, looked chic in a grey wrap coat, which she teamed with a striped scarf and leather boots. She wore her blonde hair in its signature pixie crop hairstyle and radiated a healthy glow. Prince Albert, 56, looked dapper in a grey suit, paired with a burgundy scarf and smart black coat. The new parents made their way through the crowds following a church service and stopped to shake hands with locals on their way. They also helped set light to a fishing boat - a tradition that's been going strong since the reign of Prince Louis II in 1942. The couple, who welcomed twins in December, also helped set light to a fishing boat as part of tradition . Prince Albert II and Princess Charlene left a church in Monaco after a mass celebrating the patron saint . The new parents made their way through the crowds following a traditional mass, stopping to shake hands with locals on their way . Princess Charlene showed no signs of any sleepless nights as she attended the traditional Sainte Devote celebration in Monaco. Sainte Devote, the country's patron saint, is a cherished part of Monegasque heritage . Princess Charlene, 36, looked chic in a grey wrap coat, which she teamed with a striped scarf and boots . According to legend, Christians saved St Devote's body and cast it off in a boat to Africa in the hope that once there she would receive a Christian burial. A dove then flew from her mouth and guided the boat to Monaco where it ran aground. The Saint has helped the principality in times of peril ever since. In line with the legend, Prince Albert and Princess Charlene took part in an annual ceremonial ritual remembering the Saint's final journey. They were given torches which they used to set fire to a fisherman's boat like the one that the Saint's body was carried on. According to legend, Christians saved St Devote's body and cast it off in a boat to Africa in the hope that once there she would receive a Christian burial, hence the burning ritual . On the December 10, Princess Charlene gave birth to the twins by caesarean section at the Princess Grace Hospital. The babies were born within minutes of each other, with Gabriella arriving first at 5.04pm and Jacques following at 5.06pm. The births were greeted with cannon fire and an excited outpouring of joy from locals, who flocked to the square outside the Palais Princier to celebrate. Despite being the younger of the two, it will be Prince Jacques who succeeds his father on the throne, thanks to Monaco's continued use of Salic law which states that male heirs always take precedence over their older sisters. Gabriella stills gets a title though, becoming the Countess of Carlades, while Crown Prince Jacques is styled Marquis of Baux - a name always given to the first born son. The first glimpse of the babies came 13 days after the birth, when a set of five photographs of the newborn royal babies and their proud parents was released by the Palais Princier on the December 23.

"Two former contestants from NBC's The Biggest Loser have admitted their drastic weight loss was only short-lived, and that 'just about everyone' they know from previous seasons have since piled the pounds back on. Suzanne Mendonca, a 36-year-old New York-based police officer who lost 90lbs when she appeared on season two in 2005, told The New York Post: 'NBC never does a reunion. Why? Because we’re all fat again.' Ms Mendonca, along with 44-year-old Rulon Garner - a former wrestler who walked off the show during season 11 having lost 173lbs - also both echoed recent allegations from other contestants over NBC's 'abusive' treatment of its participants. Scroll down for video . Didn't last: Suzanne Mendonca, 36, lost 90lbs in 2011 after appearing in the show's second season, pictured (left) in the finale, but has since regained the weight, pictured (right) in 2012 . Too extreme: In a new interview, Ms Mendonca, pictured before she appeared on The Biggest Loser, echoed recent allegations from other contestants over NBC's 'abusive' treatment of its participants . Both Ms Mendonca and Mr Garner claim to be in contact with other former contestants from The Biggest Loser via a 'private alumni' Facebook group, which is how they know that they too have regained the weight they lost. These revelations are hardly surprising given the extreme and seemingly unsustainable regimes the contestants were put through during their time on the show. NBC's hit show, which launched in 2004, pits obese competitors against each other in a televised race to lose the most weight. Around 200,000 people audition for it every season. Netting an estimated $100million annually in advertisement sales, the program boasts an average weekly viewership of seven million people, in a country where two-thirds of the population is overweight. Gave up: Rulon Garner, 44, pictured (left) when he joined The Biggest Loser in 2011, walked out after 16 weeks and now claims producers threatened to 'destroy his name', pictured (right) in 2013 . 'I was eating baby food,' Ms Mendonca, who weighed 229lbs when she joined the show, told the publication. 'I’d wrap myself in garbage bags to sweat. We’d use the sauna for six hours a day... We would work out for four hours a day. 'People were passing out in the doctor’s office.' Mr Garner, a Greco-Roman wrestler who won an Olympic gold medal in 2000, stunned viewers and NBC staff when he left the 2011 show after 16 weeks for 'personal reasons'. Speaking about his departure now, he claims producers warned him that if he were to 'mess' with The Biggest Loser, they would 'destroy [his] name'. Both Mr Garner and Ms Mendonca said the challenged were 'rigged' and the weigh-ins were 'fake'. Ms Mendonca now takes blood-pressure pills and is pre-diabetic, while Mr Garner suffered neck and shoulder injuries as a result of the show's punishing workouts. The interviews follow a slew of recent allegations made by other former Biggest Loser contestants, including claims that participants are routinely kept prisoner in their rooms to stop them leaking storylines, have their laptops 'bugged' and are banned from calling home for six weeks. Speaking out: Former  contestant Kai Hibbard, pictured at the start of the third series, said she is sad and angry that she bought into the hype of the show after being convinced by a friend to sign up . Transformation: 'The whole f***ing show is a fat-shaming disaster that I’m embarrassed to have participated in,' said Ms Hibbard, who dropped 121 pounds from 265 (left) to 144 (right) during the program, aired in 2006 . 'Not worth it': Ms Hibbard, pictured during season three's live finale, said the show's plot - to take morbidly obese people 'and work them out to the point where they vomit' - provoked moral and ethical questions . Speaking to the New York Post, former contestant Kai Hibbard said last week that she is sad and angry she bought into the hype of the show, after being convinced by a friend to sign up to its third series. 'The whole f***ing show is a fat-shaming disaster that I’m embarrassed to have participated in,' said Ms Hibbard, whose 5ft 6ins frame was carrying 265 pounds when she joined the program in 2006. She added: 'There’s a moral and ethical question here when you take people who are morbidly obese and work them out to the point where they vomit, all because it makes for good TV.' Latest series: Ms Hibbard and other ex-contestants have claimed that competitors are kept prisoner in their rooms to stop them leaking storylines and even have their laptops 'bugged'. Above, season 16 contestants . Intense: Scott Mitchell is pictured running (left) and cycling alongside other contestants (right) on the show . After she was selected for the show, Ms Hibbard said she was flown to Los Angeles, where a production assistant showed her to her room, took away her key card and told her not to leave. If she dared to exit the room, the hotel would immediately tell the show's producers, she claimed. Ms Hibbard and her fellow contestants were also apparently made to sign contracts giving away rights to their own story lines and banning them from speaking negatively about the show. Another participant, who wished to remain anonymous, said a production assistant took away her cellphone and laptop for 24 hours when she arrived at the hotel. She suspects they were then bugged. 'The camera light on my MacBook would sometimes come on when I hadn’t checked in,' she told The Post. 'It was like Big Brother was always watching you.' In following days, 14 of 50 finalists were taken to a place called 'the ranch', where they were forced to work out in seclusion, while the others were sent home until later in the program. During their time at 'the ranch', contestants were reportedly made to work out for dangerous lengths of time - up to eight hours straight - leaving their feet bleeding and causing some to collapse. Once, they were even driven to a racetrack and housed in individual horse stalls, before a bell sounded and they were forced to run neck-to-neck, picking up heavy sacks along the track. And despite their suffering, they were prevented from calling home for six weeks - and even then, they were only allowed to make a five-minute call that was monitored by producers, it is alleged. Shocking weight loss: Last year, 5ft 4ins winner Rachel Frederickson sparked nationwide concern after losing 155 pounds in just months on the show. Above, Ms Frederickson before (left) and after (right) her weight loss . Progress: Ms Frederickson, pictured being weighed on the show, later admitted working out four times a day . 'One of the contestants’ children became very ill and was in the ICU,' Ms Hibbard said.  'He was allowed to talk to his family, but he didn’t want to leave - the show would have been done with him.' The other former competitor said the trainers took a 'sick' satisfaction in seeing them collapse - a result of a mixture of intense exercise sessions and severe restrictions on their diets. Ms Hibbard added: 'They would say things to contestants like, ""You’re going die before your children grow up."" ""You’re going to die, just like your mother"" [and] ""We’ve picked out your fat-person coffin"".' She said the one production assistant had even encouraged a contestant to take up smoking - because it would apparently help her to lose weight, impressing the show's audience. Meanwhile, one trainer even told her not to drink electroylyte-balancing liquids prescribed by an on-site doctor because it would 'ruin her one last chance to save her life', she said. Exercise: At the start of the show, contestants are apparently made to sign contracts giving away rights to their own story lines and banning them from speaking negatively about the show. Above, season three . Struggle: Jen Widerstrom (l-r), Lori Harrigan-Mack and Scott Mitchell are pictured in show's latest series . Participants' extreme, daily workouts resulted in rapid weight losses - up to 30 pounds in just one week, compared to the 'safe' limit of two pounds per week, which is considered 'hard' to lose. Indeed, the first-ever The Biggest Loser winner Ryan Benson, who dropped 122 pounds during the show (from 330 to 208), lost so much weight he reportedly started urinating blood when ended. In an interview with Time magazine, he also said he regained 32 pounds within five days of the program finishing - simply by drinking tap water. His weight now hovers at around 299 pounds. And last year, 5ft 4ins winner Rachel Frederickson sparked nationwide concern after losing 155 pounds in just months on the program. She later admitted to working out four times a day. Concern: Also last year, one of The Biggest Losers trainers, Jillian Michaels (pictured), quit for the show for the third time, telling People magazine she was 'deeply concerned' about the 'poor care of the contestants' Ms Hibbard revealed her own health was affected dramatically by the show; she reportedly suffered hair loss, irregular periods and lack of sleep both during and after her participation in the program. In total, Ms Hibbard dropped 121 pounds - taking her to just 144 pounds - throughout the program. Also last year, one of The Biggest Losers trainers, Jillian Michaels, quit for the show for the third time, telling People magazine she was 'deeply concerned' about the 'poor care of the contestants.' In a statement to the Post, NBC said its contestants are 'closely monitored and medically supervised', and cited the successful health transformations of more than 300 contestants.

"A Turkish court has ordered authorities to block access to Facebook pages that 'insult' the Prophet Mohammed and warned the whole site will be banned  if the company doesn't comply. The country's state-run news agency confirmed that a court in Ankara issued the order yesterday, following a request by a prosecutor. The decision comes just days after another court ruling banned access in Turkey to web pages featuring the controversial cover of the French satirical magazine, Charlie Hebdo depicting the Prophet Mohammed. Facebook pages, which 'insult' the Prophet Mohammed have been blocked in Turkey following a court order, with a warning the whole site will be banned if the company doesn't comply . It is the latest move to crack down on material seen as offending religious sensibilities in the largely Muslim nation, where the government of President Tayyip Erdogan is viewed as pursuing an Islamist-leaning agenda. Facebook have yet to comment on the ruling but earlier this month Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said the company would not censor content published in the wake of the Charlie Hebdo attacks. He added that the social network would 'never let one country or group of people dictate what people can share across the world.' However, according to statistics released by Facebook, the company has removed 1,893 'pieces of content' at the request of the Turkish government. Earlier this month, Turkey's president began to press for new legislation which would allow ministers to temporarily ban websites, such as Facebook, and force Twitter to block an anonymous whistleblower. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, pictured, had previously vowed to 'eradicate' Twitter after allegations of public corruption were published on the site . The proposed law would allow ministers to restrict access to websites deemed to threaten lives, public order or rights and freedoms. The Telecommunications Directorate (TIB) would have to comply within four hours, and then apply for a court order for the ban to be extended beyond 24 hours. Communications minister Lutfu Elvan this week defended the proposal, saying it was needed after Turkey's top court in October annulled previous legislation giving greater powers to ban websites, and saying it would only be used in emergencies. Earlier this month following the Paris terror attacks, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, pictured, said the company would not censor content published in the wake of the attacks . Last year Turkey came under international criticism for temporary bans on Facebook and Twitter as a corruption scandal unfolded. Erdogan vowed to 'eradicate' Twitter after allegations of government corruption were published on the micro-blogging site. Meanwhile Facebook was briefly banned in Pakistan along with Twitter after the sites refused to remove pictures pertaining to be the Prophet Muhammad. Facebook did eventually bow to pressure and blocked the images in Pakistan.","Turkish court orders Facebook pages insulting Mohammed to be blocked .

"Ralph Lauren has agreed to destroy a range of its athletic shoes, after popular footwear brand Converse filed a lawsuit against the company claiming that the designs were a direct copy of its iconic Chuck Taylor All Star sneakers. Last October, Converse Inc. filed trademark infringement lawsuits against 31 companies, including Ralph Lauren, alleging that it competitors had knocked off the sneaker's mid sole stripe and rubber toe cap. But, according to Women's Wear Daily Converse has now reached an out of court settlement with Ralph Lauren Corp, which stipulates that the rival brand must scrap all of its copycat sneakers within the next 30 days. Scarily similar: Converse Inc. filed a lawsuit against 31 companies last October, including Ralph Lauren Corp., for allegedly copying the design of its iconic Chuck Taylor All Star sneaker .

Coveted copies: The two companies have reached a settlement agreement, which stipulates that Ralph Lauren has 30 days to scrap the 36 different style of sneakers Converse had named in its complaint . The two companies have filed a joint motion to end the case pending before the US International Trade Commission. Ralph Lauren has less than one month to destroy the 36 different styles of shoes named in the complaint as well as the related molds, parts, tools, marketing, packaging and promotional materials. The company will also pay Converse an undisclosed sum, although the brand has maintained that the lawsuits are about more than just money. 'The goal really is to stop this action,' Converse chief executive Jim Calhoun told the New York Times last October. Iconic design: The Converse All Star (pictured), the brand's first sneaker created for basketball players, was introduced in 1917 and was named after basketball player Chuck Taylor . Cold hard cash: Ralph Lauren will also pay Converse an undisclosed amount of money following the settlement agreement . He added: 'I think we’re quite fortunate here to be in the possession of what we would consider to be an American icon.' The Converse All Star, the brand's first sneaker created for basketball players, was introduced in 1917 and was named after famed basketball player Chuck Taylor. But the outlet noted that trademark infringement is difficult to prove in the fashion world. Converse has to demonstrate that its design is not a part of a larger trend, but rather it is one that consumers associate with its brand. Skechers, Walmart, K-Mart, FILA and Ed Hardy were among the other companies accused of copying the brand's 'Chucks'. End game: Last October, Converse chief executive Jim Calhoun explained that the 'goal' of the lawsuit is to stop other companies from knocking off the brand's designs .

"Two men caught on security cameras in two service stations are believed to hold 'vital clues' into the murder of a frail grandfather in his home earlier this month. Raymond Parker's beaten body was discovered by a friend, after relatives had no luck getting in contact with the 75-year-old, upstairs in his property on Koo Wee Rup-Longwarry Road in Bayles, Victoria, around 2.20pm on January 13. Mr Parker, a retired butcher who was in remission for cancer, had his wallet, credit cards and cash stolen at the time of the unexplained attack and his cards were used at two different petrol stations between January 10 and 12. Police have confirmed that CCTV footage reveals two men in a white van arrived at both stations and purchased goods during this time period. Police hope the two men in this video can be identified to help solve the mysterious murder of Raymond Parker . The men were seen purchasing goods at both petrol stations during the same period that Mr Parker's stolen cards had been used . Mr Parker was last seen on the morning of January 6 and was discovered dead on January 13 . Homicide squad detectives are keen to speak to the men as they believe they may hold vital clues that will assist in the investigation into Mr Parker's death - who was last seen alive on the morning of January 6. Detective Senior Sergeant Stephen McIntyre said it was not known what involvement the two men may have had in Mr Parker's death. 'We are hoping that by speaking with these men it could give us some information that will assist the investigation into Ray's death,' he said. 'It appears he was assaulted and this could have incapacitated him, causing him to die several days after the initial assault.' Police also located a small hydroponic cannabis set-up at Mr Parker's property. 'We also can't rule out at this stage that the presence of drugs at his property is connected to his death in some way, Sen-Sgt McIntyre said. 'We're urging anyone with information regarding the identity of these men or the circumstances surrounding Ray's death to come forward.' Investigators have released CCTV footage and images of the two men and the white van in the hope someone can provide information regarding their identity. Sen Sgt McIntyre  described Mr Parker as a 'knockabout bloke' who 'kept to himself.' 'He was a fairly frail man, he was in ill health and he wouldn’t have posed any risk or threat to anyone,’’ Sen-Sgt McIntyre told the Herald Sun. Anyone with any information is urged to contact Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000 or submit a confidential crime report at crimestoppersvic.com.au .

"Doctors at one English hospital have dealt with 1,500 cases of Female Genital Mutilation (FGM) in just five years, it emerged today. Figures from Birmingham's Heartlands Hospital reveal that staff see six patients who have been subjected to the barbaric procedure every week. Nationwide, 15 new cases of FGM are reported to hospital around the country every day. But the victims of the shocking practice are clustered in certain areas, which explains the high rate in Birmingham. Scroll down for video . Birmingham's Heartlands hospital says it is dealing with six cases of Female Genital Mutilation every week . Heartlands saw 349 cases in 2013, following 288 cases in 2012, 316 in 2011 and 317 in 2010. It is thought to be one of the centres which has seen a large number of the 463 cases now being identified in England every month. NSPCC Head of Child Protection Operations John Cameron said: 'These figures show the NHS is consistently seeing a high number of FGM cases every month. 'FGM is a live public health issue and it is vital all health professionals are trained to spot the signs of FGM and that girls who are subjected to this brutal practice get the post-traumatic support they deserve. 'We need to ensure doctors, midwives and other healthcare professionals are working effectively together with children's services to support and protect FGM victims and their family members.' The records show the number of women recorded as having been subjected to the practice, even if they were in hospital for another reason. The vast majority of the cases are of women who underwent the procedure in Africa, the Middle East or parts of Asia before moving to Britain. File photo of UK Border . Campaigners have pointed out that the numbers may be just the tip of the iceberg, as only those women who have sought specific medical treatment are included in the data. It is believed the vast majority of cases are women who were born abroad and then moved to the UK in childhood or later life. Victims are often identified when they come in to have infections and other conditions linked to the procedure treated, while others are noted when they attend for pre-natal checks. Female genital mutilation (FGM) is the deliberate removal of all or part of the external female genitalia. The World Health Organisation describes FGM as any procedure that injures the female genital organs for non-medical reasons. It is also referred to as female circumcision or female cutting. FGM is mostly carried out on young girls in adolescence but is also carried out during childhood and sometimes on babies. In some cultures, it is seen as a right of passage into womanhood and a condition of marriage. Some believe the genitals will be 'unclean' if the female does not have FGM. There is also a common belief that women need to have FGM to have babies. But, infact, FGM can cause infertility and an increased risk of childbirth complications. The procedure is often carried out by a woman with no medical training. Anaesthetics and antiseptic treatments are not generally used and the practice is usually carried out using knives, scissors, scalpels, pieces of glass or razor blades. The procedure can cause severe bleeding and infections, which can last the woman's entire lifetime. It is estimated that 3 million girls are cut every year across the world. Around 23,000 of these are carried out in the UK. The practice is particularly rife in some African, Middle Eastern and Asian countries. FGM has been illegal in the UK since 1984 and since 2003 anyone taking a child out of the UK for the practice faces 14 years in prison. Despite the rise in hospital cases and an increase in reports to police in 2014 there has not been a single conviction in the UK. Research by the charity Equality Now and City University last year estimated more than 100,000 women have migrated to England and Wales after suffering FGM - up more than 50% since 2001. The Birmingham hospital's figures were released after the Muslim Women's Network told the West Midlands Police and Crime Panel that the levels current support and counselling for victims - many of whom suffer flashbacks - are not good enough. The charity said the latest case it uncovered was just last week and involved a young Yemeni girl from an unnamed Birmingham school. Shaita Gohir MBE, who is chair of the charity, told the panel: 'We need to get funding for specific counselling in this area.' Birmingham is one of the most ethnically diverse cities in Britain. In the 2011 census, more than 280,000 residents - 26% of the city's population - gave their ethnicity as Asian or Asian-British, 93,000 said they consider themselves Black or Black-British and 10,900 listed themselves as Arab. Earlier this month, Britain's top family judge, Sir James Munby called on local councils to do more to battle what he called 'the great evil' of FGM. He said: 'Plainly, given the nature of the evil, prevention is infinitely better than cure. 'Local authorities need to be pro-active and vigilant in taking appropriate protective measures to prevent girls being subjected to FGM. 'The court must not hesitate to use every weapon in its protective arsenal if faced with a case of actual or anticipated FGM.' *The NSPCC operates an FGM helpline. Anyone in need of advice should phone 0800 028 3550.","Scale of the issue in the UK revealed by data showing cases in hospitals .

"A company that helps you get back at your enemies by posting them parcels of glitter has been sold for more than $100,000. Mathew Carpenter, set up the ShipYourEnemiesGlitter.com only 10 days ago, on a whim. The 22-year-old Sydneysider, who admits 'he hates glitter' created the website that offers to mail a package full of the stuff to anyone, along with a letter telling the recipient they are a horrible person, anywhere in the world for $9.99. 9 News reported that after Mr Carpenter put the website up for sale on start-up marketplace Flippa. It was listed with a starting bid of just $1, and ended up selling for $105,927 after attracting 345 bids. The buyer is reportedly online entrepreneur Peter Boychuk. Scroll down for video . The next big thing: ShipYourEnemiesGlitter.com promises to send an envelope full of glitter to your enemies . An illustration on the website demonstrates the extreme frustration your enemy will experience when they receive an envelope packed with glitter . Although many people may think glitter is 'fun', they are wrong as it can be used as a harmless but intensely irritating torture . Mr Boychuk said in a statement through Flippa he plans on immediately reactivating the order form on the site and fulfilling all pending orders, which are said to be around 10,000. 'This was only intended to be a small side project. It’s taken on a life of its own, and I want to watch it continue to grow under a new owner,' Mr Carpenter said. Obviously revenge sells. An envelope full of millions of tiny, plastic pieces of glitter is all that is needed to tip someone right over the edge, with the sparkly misery promised to last weeks. The website was just a day old when Mr Carpenter spoke to the Daily Mail Australia earlier this month as their sales escalated rapidly. 'I'm a 22 year old dude that has too much free time apparently because now my plans for the next few weeks will consist of sending stupid glitter to terrible people,' Carpenter told Daily Mail Australia at the time. 'People call it the herpes of the craft world,' the website said. 'Pay us money, provide an address anywhere in the world and we'll send them so much glitter in an envelope that they'll be finding it everywhere for weeks.' In just 24 hours of the website launching it had gone viral worldwide, with over 1.3m visits, and 250k social shares. Rave reviews, as well as complaints from unhappy envelope recipients, indicate the product's effectiveness . The glitter will stick to every possible surface of the recipient's body and home and will continually and inexplicably appear for weeks after the ambush . Part of the appeal was that each package individually was 'wrapped with hate' by Carpenter himself for the incredibly low price of $9.99 per envelope. The hateful envelopes may seem harmless, with some people on Social Media initially expressing confusion at the concept due to their personal love of glitter. However, the frustration felt when covered with seemingly endless pieces of glitter cannot be fully understood unless one has experienced the twinkly torture. It sticks to clothes, skin, hair and furniture and somehow has the creepy ability to pop up when least expected for weeks after the glitter ambush. These envelopes from hell, also known in some circles as 'glitter bombs', were soon an overnight sensation, and just hours after launching the website was forced to suspend purchases. 'You guys have a sick obsession with shipping people glitter,' remarked Carpenter. The website has a helpful FAQ section, although they point out 'Yes, somehow we do have Frequently Asked Questions' The website enjoyed glowing reviews from thrilled customers, including gleeful Grady Chambers: . 'I bought this for my husband, he opened the mail before work & got it everywhere! He had to change, was late for work and might be getting fired, LOL!' However, Alma Henry warned people to not underestimate the power of glitter. 'For my one year anniversary I didn't know what to get my wife, so I bought this thinking it would be funny. 'It wasn't, I'm now divorced, broke and living with my best friend. I'd like to talk with the owner to get a refund and discuss damages.'

"Since July 2013, the Curiosity rover has travelled just over 23,300ft (7,100 metres) on the surface of Mars at an average of about 1,310ft (400 metres) per month. But if a new Nasa project comes to fruition, future rovers could carry a small helicopter with them that could cover half a kilometre in just a single day. The vehicle would perform daily flights to scout the surrounding area on Mars much faster than possible for ground based rovers. Scroll down for video . Nasa scientists in California are testing a concept Mars helicopter (illustration shown). The small device would be launched to the red planet with another rover. It would scout locations ahead for the rover to travel to and explore. And it would be able to travel much greater distances than the rover . The concept is currently being tested by scientists at Nasa’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in California. It is designed to provide an alternative to the slow, methodical progress required by rovers in order to avoid obstacles and plot a safe route across the red planet. Nasa's unnamed next generation rover, predicted to launch in 2020, will carry on exploring the Red Planet, with upgraded hardware and instruments to examine Mars' rocks - and it will possibly even take this Mars helicopter design with it. The rover will assess the potential of the environment for humans to live in one day and search for signs of Martian life. It will identify and collect a collection of rock and soil samples, which it will be able to send back to Earth intact, unlike the powdered samples collected by the current rover. Dr Charles Elachi, director of Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, has previously said that collecting a rock sample and bringing it back to Earth is Nasa's top priority. Scientists are particularly interested in the samples so they can understand the hazards posed by Martian dust and demonstrate how oxygen can be created - details important to consider for human missions to Mars and the future colonisation of the planet. The rover marks the next major step in fulfilling President Obama's challenge of sending humans to Mars in the 2030s. The vehicle envisioned would be composed of a small cube with rotor blades on the top. It would weigh 2.2lbs (1kg) and measure 3.6ft (1.1 metres) across from the tip of one blade to the other. While the design is still very much in a concept stage, the vehicle would likely have a camera to ‘scout out’ areas ahead and help a rover on the surface move faster. On the top of the helicopter would be a solar panel to power it during the day, and keep it operational during the night. Each time it took flight on a daily basis, it would fly for about two to three minutes before landing on the ground again. ‘If our rover was equipped with its very own helicopter that could see over the tall object in front of us, it would allow us to make decisions much more efficiently, on which we’d command the rover,’ explained Mike Meecham, Mechanical Engineer at JPL, in a video detailing the concept. Although Mars has just three eighths of Earth’s gravity, he explained that it isn’t necessarily easier to fly on Mars - because the atmosphere is so thin. Once you lose Earth’s dense atmosphere, the rotor blades would need to spin faster or be bigger, or the helicopter lighter than one on Earth, in order to fly. Each day the helicopter could fly for up to three minutes and cover half a kilometre away from the rover (illustrated). But it will have to contend with difficult conditions on the red planet including a thinner atmosphere in order to repeatedly take off and land . The vehicle envisioned would be composed of a small cube with rotor blades on the top. It would weigh 2.2lbs (1kg) and measure 3.6ft (1.1 metres) across from the tip of one blade to the other. Nasa has been testing a prototype (shown) in a vacuum chamber on Earth . ‘There is the challenge of the very low density of the atmosphere, and there’s the challenge of keeping the whole mass of the system small so that we don’t overwhelm the lift capability of this system,’ said Dr Bob Balaram, a roboticist at JPL involved in the design of the helicopter. ‘It has to be autonomous in terms of being able to fly and maintain stable flight, and then, this system has to repeatedly take off and land on natural rocky terrain like you see out here. And then, the other one is that it has to survive the harsh environment.’ Nasa has already built a full scale mock up of one of the helicopters they might consider flying on Mars, which they have been testing in a vacuum chamber on Earth. They have found that the rotors need to spin at about 2,400 rotations per minute to provide enough lift for two to three minute flights of about half a kilometre. But it is the landings that will be the riskiest part of the mission every day. Curiosity infamously had ‘seven minutes of terror’ in the time between entering the Martian atmosphere and landing on the, but Dr Balaram said the helicopter would have its own ‘seven seconds of terror’ every day. When the concept would be completed however, or whether it could be part of Nasa’s 2020 Mars rover mission, is not yet known. But the design does at least provide an intriguing proposal for future missions to the red planet.

"Experts searching for the lost remains of the author of Don Quixote have found wooden fragments of a casket bearing his initials with bones in and around them in a crypt  in Madrid. The remains thought to be that of Miguel de Carvantes were found underneath a chapel of a cloistered convent. Archaeologists made the find over the weekend during excavations to solve the centuries-old mystery of where the famed Spanish writer was laid to rest. The initials on a plank of the coffin were formed with metal tacks embedded into the wood. Experts searching for the lost remains of the author of Don Quixote have found wooden fragments of a casket bearing his initials with bones in and around them in a crypt in Madrid . On one of the wooden fragments the initials 'MC' can be clearly seen; investigators also discovered bones which they are now trying to determine whether they belong to the late author Miguel de Carvantes . The bones of at least 10 people, including children, were found inside the niche containing the broken wooden planks of the coffins . Experts pic through the broken coffins and dirt looking for bone fragments and other evidence . The bones of at least 10 people were found inside the niche containing the broken wooden planks of the coffin, though some of the remains belonged to children, said forensic anthropologist Francisco Etxeberria. Mr Etxeberria is to examine the bones to determine whether Cervantes' are among them. Cervantes was 69 when he died in 1616 and in accordance with his wishes, he was buried in the Convent of the Barefoot Trinitarians in Madrid's historic Barrio de las Letras, or Literary Quarter. In 1673 his bones went missing when work was done at the convent. Investigators will use clues from the author's own stories to help them identify the remains. Shortly before his death Cervantes wrote that he only has six teeth. But the most obvious marks will be the battle wounds that Cervantes sustained. A plaque commemorating Cervantes on the Convent of Trinitarians in Madrid where he was buried . In 1571, the writer was wounded in the Battle of Lepanto, which pitted Ottoman Turkish forces against the Holy League, led by Spain. Aboard the ship La Marquesa, Cervantes was hit with three musket shots, two in the chest and one in his hand. He spent several months in a hospital in Sicily, but managed to recover. Cervantes is a towering figure in Spanish culture. His novel 'The Adventures of the Ingenious Nobleman Don Quixote of La Mancha' changed Spanish literature. Don Quixote was the magnum opus of Miguel de Carvantes and was published in two volumes, in 1605 and 1615. It is considered the most influential work of Spanish literature and is considered one of the greatest works of fiction ever published. Carvantes influence on the Spanish language has been so great that the language is often referred to as 'the language of Cervantes'. The author died in 1616 at the age of 69. In accordance with his wishes, Cervantes was burried in in the Convent of the Barefoot Trinitarians in Madrid's historic Barrio de las Letras, or Literary Quarter. His bones went missing in 1673 when work was undertaken at the convent.

"Oklahoma is debating the delay of three executions while the U.S. Supreme Court reviews the kind of sedative used for lethal injections. It comes after a number of death row inmates suffered reactions to the drug or were not rendered sufficiently unconscious. Rather than stop the executions himself, Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt took the unusual step of asking the justices for a stay. The review will test the sedative - midazolam - to check that it renders recipients unconscious, the state's attorney general said in a Monday filing with the court. Delayed? Richard Glossip, 52, who arranged for his employer to be beaten to death, may not be executed this Thursday as the Supreme Court reviews the sedative used in lethal injections by Oklahoma state . Also put on hold: John Grant, 53, (left) is scheduled to die on February 19 for stabbing a correction worker to death, and Benjamin Cole, 49, (right) who killed his nine-month-old daughter, is due to die on March 5 . Oklahoma wants the right to resume executions if it finds a different suitable drug. The delay would affect inmate Richard Glossip, 52, who was convicted of arranging for 'the beating death of his employer'; John Grant, 53, who 'stabbed a correction worker to death'; and Benjamin Cole, 49, who 'bent his nine-month-old daughter in half, breaking her spine, killing her.' Glossip is scheduled to be executed on Thursday. Grant's execution is set for February 19 and Cole is scheduled to be put to death March 5. They are among four death row inmates who sued the state, saying they fear the sedative midazolam cannot prevent their suffering as lethal drugs take effect. States that have the death penalty execute convicts using three drugs. The first sedates the inmate, the second paralyzes, and the third stops their heart. Oklahoma adopted midazolam in 2013, which is also used in Florida. The first execution using midazolam was called off after the convict, murderer Clayton Lockett, clenched his teeth, moaned and writhed on the gurney before a doctor noticed a problem with the intravenous line. One of the four was executed this month and showed no signs of physical distress. Charles Warner implied discomfort during his final statement January 15 but before any lethal drugs were administered. 'It is important that we act in order to best serve the interests of the victims of these horrific crimes and the state's obligation to ensure justice in each and every case,' Pruitt said in a statement. 'The families of the victims in these three cases have waited a combined 48 years for the sentences of these heinous crimes to be carried out.' Oklahoma, as well as Florida, uses midazolam as one of three drugs in lethal injection executions. The second drug serves to paralyze the inmate and the third one is used to stop his heart. Last April, Oklahoma used midazolam for the first time in the execution of death row inmate Clayton Lockett, who clenched his teeth, moaned and writhed on the gurney before a doctor noticed a problem with the intravenous line and the execution was called off. Lockett died 43 minutes after the procedure began. Decision to make: Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt must decide whether to halt the executions . An investigation found he died due to the lethal drugs he was given. Oklahoma revamped its procedures in response to the Lockett execution, including a fivefold increase in the amount of midazolam used. 'Two federal courts have previously held the current protocol as constitutional, and we believe the United States Supreme Court will find the same,' Pruitt said.","Four death row inmates sued the state saying they fear the sedative midazolam cannot prevent their suffering during lethal injection .

She said: 'We were meant to be going on a family camping trip that day and I'd woken up really excited before anyone else. 'I spotted the lighter on the coffee table in the lounge and just lit it to burn off the thread. 'The next thing I was surrounded by flames and I started screaming.' She wore compression pads, a face mask and gloves for two years to help her skin heal while her friends didn't treat her differently and she wasn't teased at school, she believed she looked 'horrible'. She is pictured in 2012 having an operation on the skin on her chest . Miss Cummings (pictured left and right) said her friends didn't treat her differently, but people in the street stared at her scars. She got changed for P.E. in a different room so she didn't have to endure girls staring . Her parents, Anne and John, called an ambulance and she was rushed to Inverclyde Royal Hospital. From there she was transferred to the burns unit at Yorkhill Hospital, Glasgow, and put in a medical coma for seven weeks to let her injuries heal. She said: 'I had no idea where I was. 'Mum and dad told me surgeons had taken skin grafts from my right leg to repair my face, neck, upper body, left arm, left leg and tummy. Third degree, or full thickness burns, are where all three layers of skin (the epidermis, dermis and subcutis) are damaged. In this type of burn, the skin is often burnt away and the tissue underneath may appear pale or blackened. The remaining skin will be dry and white, brown or black with no blisters. The texture of the skin may also be leathery or waxy. 'The skin on my left hand had melted through to the bone and doctors had warned them I could lose my finger, but they managed to save it.' After she was wokem up from the coma, it took her three months to work up the courage to look in a mirror. 'I told my dad I wanted to die,' she said. 'It was so red and raw. I felt horrible.' When she left hospital she had to become used to strangers staring. 'Thankfully, when I went back to school, I didn't get teased but I still hated my reflection,' she said. 'My life had changed forever. I wore pressure garments under my clothes for two years and a face mask and gloves to protect my skin. 'Once the garments came off, my skin did look smoother but without them, my scars were more visible. 'I couldn't bear the other girls staring at me so I changed for PE in a different room. 'My best friends didn't treat me any differently, but that didn't change how I felt about myself. Miss Cummings had started a college course in nursing but after she missed her period and realised she was pregnant. Now she calls her son Carsyn her 'little miracle' Carsyn has given Miss Cummings a new purpose, she said: 'Before, I used to be down in the dumps a lot but Carsyn has made me realise what life is all about' 'It took me four years to feel brave enough to go out shopping with them.' She began a college course in nursing but after she missed her period, realised she was pregnant. The idea of having let alone a baby seemed like a distant dream. 'It wasn't something I'd ever thought would happen,' Miss Cummings said. 'It was massive. I was living in my own flat but my mum helped. She's been amazing.' Miss Cummings's pregnancy was closely monitored due to the scarring on her stomach, left after her burns. She was induced a week before her due date as her skin would not stretch any further. The birth of her son has given her a new lease of happiness. 'Before, I used to be down in the dumps a lot but Carsyn has made me realise what life is all about,' she said. 'He doesn't see my scars and I am bringing him up not to stare at people like some children do. 'All is he sees when he looks at me is his mummy who loves him. 'I see a miracle I never thought I'd get. I feel blessed.'","Nikita Cummings tried to burn off a stray thread on her nightdress .

"Demand for properties which cost £1million a year to rent is soaring amid growing concerns about mansion tax and stamp duty, according to a new report. The £1million-plus rental market has boomed since 2010, when two large penthouses were let out in Mayfair, London. Since then, the market has grown across the capital to include properties in Knightsbridge, Chelsea, South Kensington, Notting Hill, Regent's Park, St John's Wood and Holland Park. The average weekly rent in London's ultra-prime lettings market is now £3,500 per week or £182,000 per year. The £1million-plus rental market has boomed since 2010 and the average weekly rent in London's ultra-prime lettings market is now £3,500 per week or £182,000 per year. Pictured: A luxury mansion in Rutland Gardens in Knightsbridge where rental properties cost £768,000 a year . One exclusive six-bedroom mansion (pictured), situated next door to the Qatari Royal Family in Westminster's Cornwall Terrace - known as the most expensive terrace in the world - is currently on the market for a whopping £960,000 a year. The luxury property's deposit alone is £260,000 . The Cornwall Terrace ambassadorial-style property, with large sweeping rooms, measures 8,883 sq. ft and is finished to a high specification . It is a 23 per cent rise on five years ago and is more than the average price paid last month for a home in England and Wales. Across Central London, the average rent paid in the third quarter of 2014 was 6.5 per cent higher than 12 months earlier - the highest rate of growth for more than three years. The luxury houses tend to be let by Africans, Middle East tenants and Russians, who have made their wealth from oil, gas, investments or commodity trading. Apartments and penthouses tend to be let by UK, North American, Continental European and Asian households. It is now thought the number of people looking to rent high-end properties rather than buy could increase even further. An undersupply of luxury properties and concerns about the 2015 election, the proposed mansion tax and the recent Stamp Duty changes are driving the wealthy into the rental market, according to a new report by Beauchamp Estates and Dataloft, the market intelligence group. Gary Hersham, managing director of Beauchamp, is currently looking to let a six-bedroom mansion next door to the Qatari Royal Family in Cornwall Terrace - which overlooks Regent's Park and is known as the most expensive terrace in the world. The 8,883 sq. ft. ambassadorial-style home is on the rental market for £960,000 per year with any prospective tenant having to stump up a £260,000 deposit. Across Central London, the average rent paid in the third quarter of 2014 was 6.5 per cent higher than 12 months earlier - the highest rate of growth for more than three years.

Mr Hersham also has a five-bedroom property in Knightsbridge on the rental market for £768,000 per year. It boasts a swimming pool and jacuzzi and requires an £85,000 deposit. He said: 'Concerns over a change of government, the mansion tax debate and now Stamp Duty changes have led high-net-worth-individuals to decide to rent for the next 12 months and delay purchase plans. 'This might cost a client up to £1 million, but this is less than a £25 to £100 million outlay for an ultra-prime property. 'Whilst the ultra-prime lettings market has boomed during 2014 the equivalent sales sector has been affected by the uncertainty in the market caused by the pending general election and the issues over the Mansion Tax.' Another London agency, Rokstone Properties, is looking to rent out a Mayfair mansion for £576,000 per year. The five-storey townhouse on Audley Street in Westminster boasts eight bedrooms, five bathrooms, four living rooms and a gym, sauna and plunge pool.

Estate agent Russell Simpson also has The Court House available in Chelsea for a whopping £600,000 per year. Lottie Henniker-Major, head of lettings at Russell Simpson, said there is a lull of available properties which is pushing prices up. She said: 'There is a distinct shortage of stock in the upper end of the market with no new properties having come on to the market in the £7000 pw+ price bracket in 2015 so far. 'I can only predict that this will lead to a further increase in rental prices moving forward.'","Soaring demand for high-end rental properties amid growing concerns of mansion tax and stamp duty changes .

"Deflate-gate has consumed the sports world in the run-up to the Super Bowl on Sunday - and it's all hurting Tom Brady's feelings. The New England Patriots quarterback says he took football tampering allegations personally after  11 of the 12 footballs tested by the NFL were found to be two PSI less than league minimums. Brady once again denied having anything to do with the fact that his footballs were improperly inflated in an interview with WEEI sports radio in Boston on Monday. Scroll down for audio . New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady, says speculation that he was involved in deflate-gate and tampered with his footballs 'hurt his feelings' Brady appeared on Monday alongside owner Bob Kraft (second right) and head coach Bill Belichick (right) at a send-off ceremony before the team headed to Phoenix to prepare for the Super Bowl . 'I’ve tried to wrap my head around it, too. I’ve done that and I’m trying to move past that, because I continue to try to rehash things,' he said. 'I personalized a lot of things and thought this was all about me, and my feelings got hurt. 'Then I moved past it, because it’s not serving me.' The Patriots are still fending off cheating allegations less than a week before the Super Bowl, where they will face the Seattle Seahawks this coming Sunday. Embattled: Belichick, who has been caught cheating once before, has denied any wrongdoing. Critics have suggested that billionaire team owner Bob Kraft (left) could get the team out of trouble . Adoring fans braved the cold - and threat of blizzard - to send their team off to Phoenix on Monday . Investigators found that 11 out of the 12 footballs used by the Patriots offense during the AFC Championship game were under-inflated, which makes them easier to throw, catch and carry . Already, some Seahawks are speaking out about the NFL's investigation of 'deflate-gate.' Richard Sherman, the Seattle cornerback, says he doesn't believe the Patriots will be punished for breaking the rules because Patriots owner Robert Kraft is so close to NFL commissioner Roger Goodell. 'Will they be punished? Probably not. Not as long Robert Kraft and Roger Goodell are still taking pictures at their respective homes. He was just at Kraft's house last week before the AFC Championship. Talk about conflict of interest. As long as that happens, it won't affect them at all,' Sherman fumed. Brady told WEEI that he has now blocked out the deflate-gate speculation and is working to focus 100 percent on the upcoming Super Bowl - his sixth appearance with the Patriots. On Sunday, he told ESPN that he hadn't been contacted by NFL investigators - and didn't expect to hear from them until after the big game. The Indianapolis Colts complained that the Patriots' footballs were under-inflated during their 45-7 drubbing in the AFC Championship game on January 18. Under-inflated balls are easier to catch and throw in bad weather and they are also easier to carry and harder to fumble. Sports statistician Warren Sharp wrote last week that the Patriots' historically low fumble rate - once every 187 plays - is almost statistically impossible, and dramatically better than even the runner-up team. This Patriots team was able to achieve the record while running more than 200 more running plays than the team with then next-lowest fumble rate - the 2006-2010 Indianapolis Colts.","Brady says he 'took it personally' that he was accused of cheating .

We do know that Jennifer Aniston is a fan of her little black dresses, but she steered well away from safe at the Screen Actors Guild Awards when she turned up in a plunging maxi dress in a gold-green shade. The dress that really bared all looked stunning on the Cake star and despite her not picking up an accolade once again this awards season, Jen was a winner in our eyes. She teamed the V-neck number with the Amrit long-link necklace that she actually wore to the Critics' Choice Awards just last week. The dress really skimmed her trim physique and her golden tumbling locks fitted in nicely so it got the thumbs up from us.

Earlier this month she chose a similarly exposing top as she wore a trouser suit with nothing underneath the jacket to the Annual Critics Choice Movie Awards. The plunging necklines show how the former Friends star has grown in confidence and style since she first found fame in the Nineties. When the hit TV show first aired, she perfected a girl next door look often looking casual in trousers and V-neck T-shirts. At the Critics' Choice Movie Awards earlier this month, she wore a similar plunging style top . The actress has admitted her confidence is sky high since becoming engaged to Justin Theroux and it's reflected in her daring wardrobe choices . Back then, people were more obsessed with her hair than her wardrobe as fans rushed to copy her 'Rachel' haircut. If she did glam up for a red carpet event, more often than not, she chose floor-length gowns that hid her legs. Her favoured style in the late nineties and early noughties - when she was married to Brad Pitt - were dresses that either covered her chest in a halter neck fashion or were strapless showing just a hint of cleavage. Not so confident in the Nineties: Attending a Good Will Hunting screening in 1997, left, and Meet Joe Black premiere in 1998, right, Jennifer covers up and looks dowdy in black . As the Friends cast visit London in 1998, Jennifer again opts for a simple black outfit . In her Friends heyday, it was her hair that everyone wanted rather than her girl-next-door wardrobe . Full-length and not so fabulous: A frumpy long dress at the Object Of My Affection premiere in 1998, left, and a drab choice for the Screen Actors Guild Awards in 2000, right . Following her split from Brad - who famously moved on with Angelina Jolie - she seemed keen not to draw attention to herself in plain, black dresses on special occasions. But by 2008, she seemed keen to show him what he was missing, starting to get more daring with her outfits by stepping out in mini dresses that showed off her slim figure and perfect pins. Now in her forties, she upped the ante again, choosing thigh-high split dresses - and currently the plunging necklines - to show how age hasn't dented her body confidence. In fact, she says she's getting happier with her appearance with age. Bohemian look: Covered up as she's joined by then husband Brad Pitt at the Emmys in 1999 . A red Prada dress at the 2000 Emmy Awards revealed only a hint of cleavage and kept her legs under wraps . A baggy halter neck top and black trousers worn when she won a Golden Globe for Friends in 2003 . Another elegant but not revealing dress worn to accompany Brad to the 2004 Troy premiere . Long strapless dresses were fast becoming her signature look, like this one worn to the 2004 Emmy Awards . Winning GQ Magazine's 'Woman of the Year' in 2005 - the year she divorced Brad - she looks glum in an LBD . At the Vanity Fair Oscar party in 2006 her black dress swamps her figure and looks morbid . The actress admitted at the end of last year that she's '100 per cent' more confident than she's ever been and she's learnt to love her figure. 'It's true, youth is wasted on the young. There's no doubt about it,' Jennifer told Access Hollywood's Liz Hernandez. 'I look at all of my girlfriends and friends, and I think we're all becoming more and more in our bodies.' By 2008, she starts to look happy and and more confident again - showing off her legs like she did on the red carpet at the Marley and Me premiere with Owen Wilson . For the 2009 Oscars, she stuck to her tried and trusted long strapless gown style . More mini dresses at the Horrible bosses premiere in 2011, left and a perfume launch in 2010 . Pretty dresses that show off her legs but still keeping her décolletage covered at The We Are The Millers premiere in 2013, left, and Horrible Bosses premiere in 2011 . Shortly after turning 40, Jennifer shows she's becoming happier with her body with age wearing this sleeveless gown split to the thigh to the 2010 Golden Globes . The star's soaring self-esteem is largely thanks to her relationship with fiancé, Justin Theroux, who she is expected to marry this year. 'It's absolutely one of the happiest times in my life,' she said of her current situation. So it seems for the Horrible Bosses star the cliche is true - life really does begin at 40. The actress ditched black dresses to look bold in red at the 2013 Oscars joined by Justin .

"They are extraordinary Australians with remarkable achievements, any of them deserving of the country's highest honour. But many state and national Australian of the Year nominees did not get the attention they deserved after Prime Minister Tony Abbott appointed Prince Philip as a Knight. There have been reports of a backbench revolt after Mr Abbott decided to bestow the title on a man who already has more than his fair share. Today, Daily Mail Australia presents the incredible stories of four respected Australians  listed in this year's honour roll. LIEUTENANT GENERAL DAVID MORRISON . Chief of Army: Lt. Gen. David Morrison's bold address to his recruits in 2013 stirred international attention . He's the straight-laced army man who is attempting to change the Australian military. In June 2013, Chief of Army David Morrison garnered international attention for his message to recruits urging them to respect women - 'or get out'. His stern video message - produced after allegations Army officers were sending explicit online messages about women - went viral, both at home and internationally. He was showered with praise for his line: 'The standard you walk past is the standard you accept.' But that was just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to his efforts to transform Army culture. Last year alone, his efforts included a drive to recruit 600 female soldiers, work for the White Ribbon organisation and a landmark address to a United Nations Summit. Lt. Gen. Morrison was an ACT finalist for the Australian of the Year awards. The Australia Day Council noted: 'David is leading the way in ensuring that service achievements rest on talent, not gender.' DR GILL HICKS . Terror survivor: Gill Hicks lost her legs in the 7/7/2005 London Tube bombings and became a peace campaigner . She was the last person to be rescued from the wreckage of a London train blown up by merciless terrorists in July 2005. But after the most unimaginably awful experience - she lost her legs and nearly died - Dr Gill Hicks has turned her attention to producing works of undeniable good. In the years since the calamity, Hicks became an peace campaigner, founding the organisation M.A.D. (Making A Difference) For Peace. It encourages to people of different cultures and backgrounds to come together at community events and focus on the things people have in common. It's a challenging job, especially given not everyone is working for the same goal.In an interview with the ABC in 2007, Ms Hicks revealed she had received hate mail from some opposed to her message of tolerance. Dr Hicks was a national finalist for this year's Australian of the Year awards. DR MIRIAM-ROSE UNGUNMERR-BAUMANN . First Indigenous teacher in the Northern Territory: Dr Miriam-Rose Ungunmerr Baumann has changed lives in her Daly River community . She only had the opportunity to attend primary school, but Dr Miriam-Rose Ungunmerr-Baumann has carved out a remarkable role in the education sector. In 1975, she was the Northern territory's first Indigenous school teacher and in 1993 she rose to become the Principal of  St Francis Xavier Catholic School in Nauiyu, Daly River. Passionate about visual arts and Indigenous culture, Dr Ungunmerr-Baumann has spear-headed efforts for the arts to be taught at every school and for Indigenous people to become teachers. Her school is now 'completely staffed and managed by Aboriginal people', according to the Jesuit Social Justice Centre, and her teaching integrates both western and traditional cultures. She has advised governments and established centres that help women across the Daly River area. Unsurprisingly, Dr Ungunmerr-Baumann was a Northern Territory Finalist for Australian of the Year. DR ANNIE SPARROW . Health champion: Dr Annie Sparrow's passion for the most vulnerable people around the world has saved countless lives . Whether she's in Perth, in London, or in Afghanistan under the Taliban - she's the doctor whose passion for those most vulnerable has saved lives around the world. In her determination to help people, paediatrician Dr Annie Sparrow has worked in some of the world's most hostile environments. She's helped health workers fight cholera in Africa, malaria in Somalia, refugees in Woomera and Indigenous people in the outback. Most recently, the global health specialist has made regular visits to the besieged Syrian border to in an effort to contain a worrying series of break-outs of once rare infectious diseases, including polio. Dr Sparrow was a WA finalist for Australian of the Year.","These are the stories of four remarkable Australians .

"A newlywed couple have taken their relationship to new heights after holding their wedding ceremony at the top of an 11,000-foot mountain. Last August, Brian and Mandy Fabel, from Lander, Wyoming, spent a full 24 hours traveling across the 50 miles from their home to the top of Pingora Peak, one of the Cirque of the Towers mountains. The bride, 29, and groom, 32, started their wedding day by cycling for 10 miles, which was followed by grueling 25-mile hike, before taking on the tricky final stages of their ascent to the summit. Scroll down for video . Ain't no mountain high enough: Brian (left) and Mandy Fabel (right), from Lander, Wyoming, scaled an 11,000-foot peak to tie the knot, accompanied by their friend Jamie O'Donnell (center) Kiss the bride: The couple traveled 50 miles to reach the top of Pingora Peak, one of the Cirque of the Towers mountains, over the full 24 hours of their wedding day last August . But despite the wedding’s unique location, the couple stuck to tradition when it came to Mrs Fabel’s wedding dress. The bride to be donned a simple white dress for the high-altitude ceremony – which she bought for for $8. Both the bride and the groom said that the 12-minute exchange of vows was just what they had dreamed of and left them sky-high. Mrs Fabel said: 'It was completely perfect. 'We were atop Pingora Peak in the Cirque of the Towers and the views were astounding. The weather was fantastic, and we had the place to ourselves.

Top of the frock: Despite bucking other traditions, Mrs Fabel decided to wear a white dress at the high-altitude ceremony . Get lifted: The 12-minute exchange of vows was just what the pair dreamed of and left them sky-high . 'After we returned we heard a lot of ""well, it doesn't surprise me in the least"", and people were genuinely happy for us.' The idea for the quirky ceremony came five years ago from the couple’s long-time friend Jamie O'Donnell, but it was only after attending several other weddings during the year that they realized they wanted to go ahead with the unique plan. During a three-hour car ride back to their home following one of these weddings, the experienced climbers thrashed out the key details of the ceremony – and how they were going to get there. Mrs Fabel said: 'We figured there would never be a better time to take on a big objective and have the perseverance to see it through. We've been together for six years and own a house together, so life together feels pretty comfortable. Jump for joy: Mrs Fabel later said that her wedding day was 'completely perfect' Top secret: The mountain climbing-mad couple only mentioned their plan to their parents a few days through the wedding . The climb: Mrs Fabel, a charity worker, and Mr Fabel, a director at the Lander Chamber of Commerce, plan to throw a party to celebrate their marriage in July . 'We decided that not telling people would help us keep the pressure off. We knew all along we would get married in the mountains and we didn't want people to be disappointed if we didn't reach the top.' The climbing-mad couple only mentioned their plan to their parents a few days after the wedding and were only accompanied on their trek by Mr O'Donnell – before being joined by some other friends, who had opted to take an easier route to the peak. Mr O’Donnell actually signed up for an $8 online marriage license in order to preside over the ceremony, after committing to making the human-powered ascent alongside the loved-up couple. Friends Kyle Duba and Sam Lightner Jr took a much easier route to the summit and filmed the ceremony.

"Buckingham Palace officials were criticised last night for leaving 25 windows open in the historic building during one of the coldest days of the year. The windows at the front of the palace were photographed in an open position as controversy raged over the decision to fly the union flag at half mast following the death of King Abdullah in Saudi Arabia. It is understood that it costs in the region of £1.1 million a year to heat the palace. The open windows in Buckingham Palace were pictured as the union flag was at half mast for the death of Saudi King Abdullah . Jonathan Isaby of the Taxpayers' Alliance said leaving windows open on a cold day is akin to burning cash in a fire. The temperature on the day plummeted to -3 Celsius. He told The Sun: 'Closing windows on cold days is just common sense. Taxpayers don't have bottomless pockets. ' A spokesperson for Buckingham Palace said some of the windows on the top floor were left open during redecorating and maintenance work. The union flag was flown at half mast at Buckingham Palace and at several public buildings to commemorate the passing of King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia. However, flags in Saudi Arabia were not lowered as a result of their monarch's death.

"The Australian jihadi bride who ran off to the Middle East to marry a playboy turned extremist has posted chilling messages and photographs to authorities on social media. The Twitter account, believed to be linked to 21-year-old Zehra Duman, from Melbourne, shows a photo of a fighter, posing with a rifle and a dagger along with a caption: 'Catch me if you can'. It comes after her husband Mahmoud Abdullatif, who is known as the 'playboy jihadist', was reportedly killed fighting for ISIS in Syria two weekends ago. Under the Twitter name Umm Abdullatif, another photograph was uploaded on Saturday of Abdullatif standing on the side of a road with snow in the background. Picture shows a figure kneeling on the ground and posing with a rifle, along with a dagger: 'Catch me if you can' A Twitter account linked to Zehra Duham, has posted chilling messages and photographs to authorities . 'A few days before he attained shahadah. Was so excited to see the snow! Lol. Oh how I miss you, may Allah reunite us,' the caption said on the photo. As security agencies continue to set up airport terror checks and monitor the watch list, Daily Telegraph reports authorities have been alarmed with around 40 Australian foreign fighters who have managed to return on Australian soil after joining the fight with IS in Iraq and Syria. Up to 400 Australians are estimated to be fighting with IS in the Middle East or supporting the death cult across the country. Around 20 Australians have reportedly been killed in air strikes against IS, which has attracted up to 20,000 foreign fights around the globe, according to Australian intelligence. Playboy jihadi: Mahmoud Abdullatif was reportedly married to the Melbourne woman and was killed recently . Another photo was uploaded to Twitter of Abdullatif standing on the side of a road with snow in the background . A senior government official told the Daily Telegraph that these estimates of active home-grown jihadists was more than the published figures revealed by the government. 'What has us concerned is that there has been no let up in the flow,' they said. 'What we [coalition air strikes) are doing in Iraq and Syria is not deterring them from going over and joining up. 'So the rate that they are taking up with these groups means there will be many we don't know about yet.' Pictured: Mahmoud Abdullatif was reported killed in the Middle East . It follows after Melbourne man Abdullatif reportedly only became a jihadist as an excuse to 'be a part of the violence' to satisfy his aggressive nature. Abdullatif's former girlfriend came forward recently, opening up about the man she knew - a bully from Brunswick Secondary College who had a penchant for violence. Sahini Sendeera, 21, says her ex-boyfriend was a man of extremes. Abdullatif was a rebel and a womaniser who never lived a religious lifestyle, yet was fiercely proud to be a Muslim according to Fairfax Media. 'I think he liked the extreme culture of Islam and I think he just wanted to be a part of the violence,' Ms Senadeera told SMH. 'I think for him Islam was just an excuse to behave like that.'","A  widow of 'playboy jihadist' has posted chilling photos on social media .

"Hot pink uniforms are the newest fashion for inmates at the city jail in Grovetown, Georgia. The public safety chief views the style as a crime-fighting weapon. About 10 inmates donned the first batch of the brightly colored uniforms this month as they picked up trash along the city's roads. Hot pink uniforms are the newest fashion for inmates at the city jail in Grovetown, Georgia; Ten inmates donned the first batch of the brightly colored uniforms a few weeks ago . The pink uniforms will be reserved for inmates serving sentences for misdemeanor crimes. With the new rule mandating male inmates, who normally wear orange, to now wear pink - it seems to be working as sergeants said inmates commented they do not want to return to the jail if they have to wear the color, reported Atlanta Daily World. 'Folks will see our inmates picking up trash in the gullies wearing hot pink, and hopefully it'll give them a second thought if they want to come here and do wrong,' said Gary Jones, director of the city's public safety department. Jones said he was inspired by his hero, Sheriff Joe Arpaio of Maricopa County, Arizona who made international news when he required inmates to wear pink underwear and pink handcuffs. America's self-proclaimed 'toughest sheriff' also made headlines last year when it was revealed he put 38 inmates on a bread and water meal plan after they 'desecrated the American flag' in their cells. The sheriff also punishes problem inmates by forcing them to eat his 'nutraloaf', made of mash of vegetables, fruit, meat and other nutrients that are blended together and baked into a bread-like loaf. Chief Gary Jones said he was inspired by his hero, Sheriff Joe Arpaio of Maricopa County, Arizona who made international news when he required inmates to wear pink underwear and pink handcuffs . It is hoped the new rule for the Grovetown jail, located in a city with under 15,000 people in suburban Augusta, will demonstrate that law officers run the jail, not the inmates according to Jones. The state of Georgia has a recidivism rate of 30 per cent which has remained unchanged for a decade, according to a report from the Georgia Council on Criminal Justice Reform. Georgia's prison population also doubled to nearly 56,000 between 1990 and 2011. Jones hopes the uniforms will convince inmates not to come back after they are released. 'I know most men wouldn't be caught dead in one, so I thought this would be an added level of deterrence,' he said. In other moves for the jail, they have added more security cameras.","Public safety chief at Grovetown jail said move is crime-fighting weapon .

"The girl who claimed to have three breasts in a hoax that swept the internet last year has been arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence. Jasmine Tridevil, whose real name is Alisha Jasmine Hessler, was pulled over early on Monday morning in Tampa, Florida. The 21-year-old is being held on a $500 bond at Orient Road Jail, according to the Hillsborough County Sheriff's office. Scroll down for video . Charged: Jasmine Tridevil, real name Alisha Hessler, was pulled over at 3.45 on Monday in Tampa, Florida . Lies: The 21-year-old became a viral sensation last year after claiming she paid $20,000 to have a third breast added. She suggested that TV stations run a reality show about her hardships as a three-breasted woman . Tests at the scene at 3.45am showed Hessler's blood alcohol content to be .180 - more than twice Florida's legal drinking limit. Hessler made headlines in September 2014 after claiming she had paid $20,000 to surgically attach a third breast. She claimed that she was was rejected by more than 50 doctors who feared violating ethical codes before she found a willing surgeon who would perform the procedure. U.S. surgeons are barred from carrying out any operations that could be harmful to 'human dignity' under ethical codes outlined by the American Society of Plastic Surgeons. But just days later, as she attempted to land a reality show about her life as a three-breasted woman, her story was foiled. Having lost a suitcase at Tampa International Airport, she filed a report claiming the value of the contents to be worth $5,000. The report, which soon went viral, said the bag contained: 'misc female clothing, three pairs of stiletto heels, misc paperwork with owner's name, hair brush and a 3 breast prosthesis.' The revelation confirmed surgeons' suspicions reported by DailyMail.com. Scuppered: Her application for lost luggage at Tampa International Airport listed a '3 breast prosthesis' Scot Glasberg, president-elected of the American Society of Plastic Surgeons said: 'This would violate every ethical principle not just in surgery but in medicine as well.' Weeks later, a teenager interviewed byThe Sun newspaper alleged that he went on a first date with Tridevil durign which he was tied up, tortured, forced to sleep in a dog's cage and made to wear a dog's collar at her home in Tampa. He told the paper: 'She is completely psychotic. She turned me into a slave, beat me and humiliated me. 'I am physically scarred for life and live with the shame of what she did to me. 'On the night we met she tied me up and flogged me against a post. She then got me really drunk and said she wanted to cut me.' Hessler's arrest comes as she attempts to launch a career as a performer, having recorded a highly sexualized music video called Born To Serve, which she shared online.","Jasmine Tridevil, real name Alisha Hessler, arrested at 3.45am Monday .

"Hillary Clinton will seek the Democratic nomination for president in 2016 but she's 'taking her time' to make an announcement as she puts the finishing touches on her campaign infrastructure. Clinton's been all-in since December, confidantes who spoke to Politico said, and she's already decided the make up of her core team, with a few exceptions. The immediate struggle is the development of a clear hierarchy that includes husband Bill and longtime advisers yet empowers non-Clintonites managing key areas of campaign. NO RUSH: Hillary Clinton will seek the Democratic nomination for president in 2016 but she's 'taking her time' with an announcement as she puts the finishing touches on her campaign infrastructure, confidantes say . 'Part of doing something right is … taking the time to balance the advice she is getting with her own thoughts. She’s in no rush,' a Clinton adviser told Politico. 'People have been putting a red ""X"" on the calendar for a long time, but that isn’t necessarily happening internally.' Another Clinton insider who spoke to the New York Daily News says, 'It makes no sense to announce what she's doing now. 'There's no advantage for her to become the lightning rod of the Democratic party. I would not pick a date: I would try and stay out as long as I possibly could.' Clinton is making clear effort to avoid the behaviors that sunk her last presidential campaign - chief among those an attitude of inevitability that turned voters off and allowed relatively unknown Sen. Barack Obama to soar past her in Democratic primary and an unwillingness to take advice from anyone but her most trusted allies. Several aides close to Clinton will receive top billing in the campaign, including Cheryl Mills, her chief of staff at the State Department; John Podesta, the founder of Center for American Progress and a former chief of staff to Bill Clinton; and Huma Abdein, an assistant to Clinton at State who stayed on with her after her exit from the Obama administration and serves as a liaison to the White House. Politico reports that Clinton spokesman Philippe Reines will likely serve as an outside adviser as will Reines' associate Nick Merrill, another Clinton mouthpiece. Former Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee Executive Director Robby Mook has been tapped to serve as her campaign manager, multiples sources have said, and Obama alum Joel Benenson will do her polling. Democratic operatives John Anzalone and David Binder will also be involved in the polling operation, the Washington Post says, and Harry Reid adviser Jim Margolis will do her media outreach. Former President Bill Clinton moderates the opening plenary session of a Clinton Foundation conference in Indian Wells, California, on Monday. Bill will have a bigger role in Hillary Clinton's second presidential campaign, her advisers say . Politico reports that her campaign may already be making some of the same missteps that it did in 2008, however, beginning with the assumption that Clinton will be the Democratic nominee because polls show her leading her Democratic rivals by leaps and bounds. As Clinton should have learned eight years ago, early polling can be deceiving. The sudden entry of Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren into the race or a surprise showing from an unrecognized Democrat or could peel away enough support from Clinton for another formidable candidate like Vice President Joe Biden to surge. Still, her team has already begun vetting possible running mates. They include Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Casto, Colorado Sen. Michael Bennet, Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine and dark horse presidential candidate Cory Booker of New Jersey. The Daily Beast points out that Clinton may have stumbled into another hornets' nest - 'white dudefest 2016,' as few positions of authority in her unannounced campaign appear to be going to women or minorities. 'If Hillary doesn’t begin hiring well-respected African-American or Hispanic political aides in top positions, I would imagine that people will really start to wonder if she is serious about covering her left flank,' a senior African-American congressional aide told the Daily Beast. 'If that is the case they will look for a candidate who is eager to demonstrate that senior level inclusiveness is a high priority.' Reports indicate that Clinton is considering three women for the role of communications director in her campaign: White House Communications Director Jennifer Palmieri, political strategist and former Hillary spokeswoman Karen Finney and public relations guru Kiki McClean. Clinton is looking at Democratic National Committee spokesman Mo Elleithee, Politico reports. Elleithee is African-American.","Clinton's developing a clear hierarchy that includes Bill and longtime aides yet empowers non-Clintonites managing key areas of her campaign .

"Charles Blow has written about his anger after his son was held by police at gunpoint on the Yale University campus over the weekend . A journalist has written about his anger after his son was held by police at gunpoint on the Yale University campus over the weekend because he 'fitted the description' of an alleged burglary suspect. Blow, who is African American, tweeted about the incident on Saturday night when he said he was 'fuming' and also wrote about it in his column in Monday's New York Times. In his column Blow related his son's version of events, in which the young man – a third year biology major - was accosted by a campus police officer at gunpoint as he left the library. The officer told Blow's son to get on the ground and then asked a series of questions before he was eventually allowed to go on his way after showing his student ID. According to Blow, his anger with the situation was not that his son was stopped, but that the officer had been so quick to brandish his weapon. 'What if my son had panicked under the stress, having never had a gun pointed at him before, and made what the officer considered a 'suspicious' movement? Had I come close to losing him? Triggers cannot be unpulled. Bullets cannot be called back,' he wrote. The journalist, who is also a regular contributor to CNN and MSNBC, has written extensively about the recent deaths of unarmed black men - including Michael Brown and Eric Garner - at the hands of the police. Blow's anger was more apparent in a series of tweets posted on Saturday night when used hashtags including '#RacialBattleFatigue', '#BlackLivesMatter' and '#ICan'tBreathe'. Blow first tweeted his anger about his son's experience on Saturday night before writing a more considered opinion piece in Monday's New York Times . 'This is exactly why I have NO PATIENCE for people trying to convince me that the fear these young black men feel is real,' he tweeted. In his column on Monday, Blow response was more considered but just as powerful. 'I am reminded of what I have always known, but what some would choose to deny: that there is no way to work your way out — earn your way out — of this sort of crisis,' he wrote. 'In these moments, what you've done matters less than how you look. There is no amount of respectability that can bend a gun's barrel.' Blow also writes that Yale's dean has apologized to his son and the actual suspect was also  apprehended.

"A World War II combat veteran from upstate New York is returning to the scene of a bloody Pacific island battle this week as an 'army of one.' 90-year-old Don Fida of Syracuse departed Monday morning for the Marshall Islands, where U.S. forces landed on the Japanese-held atoll of Kwajalein on January 31, 1944, according to The Post-Standard of Syracuse. Fida was a member of the U.S. Army's 7th Division, which helped capture the island after a four-day battle against the Japanese. Survivor: World War II veteran Donald Fida of Syracuse, pictured, fought in five battles including the invasion of Kwajalein in the Marshall Islands . The Post-Standard of Syracuse reported that Fida was twenty years old at the time, and also fought in Okinawa and three other battles. The Japanese captured Fida, wounded his stomach and performed an incomplete castration while he was in the Phillippines, the veteran told the newspaper. Fida claimed that a school acquaintance saved him and tended to him. He received a Purple Heart and went back to Syracuse  in 1945 and later began a landscaping business, the newspaper reported. The 33 7th Division vets still alive were invited back to the island for a ceremony marking the battle's 71st anniversary, according to The Post-Standard of Syracuse - which explained that medical treatment available on Kwajalein mandates that traveling veterans must be capable of walking. 'Out of 22,000 men in the 7th Division, I'm the only one that can walk,' Fida told the newspaper. Going with his daughter Donna Wisniewski, he'll be the only 7th Division veteran attending the ceremony. 'I'm so grateful that I'm able to do this at my age and to be able to remember all of this, which is a miracle to some people,' Fida told The Post-Standard of Syracuse. Fida told the newspaper he frequently thinks of his memories from Kwajalein - including how he used a fallen comrade and friend's dead body to protect himself from bullets and informed the man's family of what happened in 2003. Fida will turn 91 on January 28 - with his Kwajalein arrival date being  January 29, the newspaper reported. Memories: Fida holds a photograph of himself during his WWII service. The 91-year-old will return to celebrate the 71st anniversary of Operation Flintlock, the Battle for Kwajalein Atoll on January 31, 1944 .","90-year-old Don Fida  departed Monday morning for the Marshall Islands .

"A lamb advertisement aimed at celebrating Australia Day has come under fire for its lack of Indigenous Australian faces. The new campaign by Meat and Livestock Australia which features cricket legend Richie Benaud was released earlier this month but some have criticised the ad for excluding other ethnic minorities. In the ad Benaud, the voice of Australian cricket, calls on the likes of Captain Cook, Ned Kelly and Don Bradman to join him for a knees up at his waterfront home. Scroll down for video . The lamb campaign which features iconic cricket commentator Richie Benaud  to promote lamb on Australia Day has come under fire for being racist . There has been mixed reaction to the advertisement on social media, with some criticising it and others praising the hilarity . But speaking to NITV News, social commentator Celeste Liddle said the advertisement was a prime example of what she believes to be wrong with the concept or Australia Day. Social commentator Celeste Liddle criticised the advertisement . 'To be honest it accurately reflects Australia day and all that's completely wrong with it,' she said. 'By that I mean we've got a bunch of white men who are completely ignoring the fact that there is history in this country that pertains to Aboriginal people and our experiences,' Ms Liddle continued. However Meat and Livestock Australia have defended their position saying they extended the invitation for many others to join the campaign, and the ad should be taken lightly. 'This chapter of the Australia Day lamb campaign was created to capture the spirit of our national day,' they told Daily Mail Australia in a statement. 'The bringing together of a group of Australian legends allowed us to honour some of the people who have helped defined Australia, in the most Aussie way possible – by sharing a lamb barbecue together. 'Meat & Livestock Australia approached numerous people from a variety of cultural backgrounds to be involved in the Australia Day lamb campaign however on this occasion some politely declined or were unavailable. 'This Australia Day lamb campaign is not intended to offend; rather it is a humorous celebration of some of the legendary figures who have made Australia great.' Benaud calls Captain Cook (left) and AFL star Sam Kekovich (right) round to his place for a lamb BBQ . Benaud later looks worried when legendary outlaw Ned Kelly (left) offers to 'round up the guys' for the barbie, while Billy Birmingham (right) hinted for an invite but was told there was no barbecue by Richie - the cricket legend clearly still bitter about Birmingham's portrayal of him as character, The Twelfth Man . Journalist and businesswoman Ita Buttrose (left) was more than happy to accept the invite from the back of her limousine, and explorers Burke (pictured bottom, in right side image) and Wills (pictured top, in right side image) agreed to attend from what looks like the Aussie outback . Social media users have had mixed reviews to the advertisement, many branding it entertaining while others have pointed out the obvious lack of multicultural faces. Released earlier in January, the ad sees Beanud take on a new role in the annual Australia Day lamb campaign - capturing the spirits by doing what we believe every Aussies should be doing - organising a big lamb BBQ and a game of backyard cricket. The Australian icon has joined with 'Lambassador' Sam Kekovich as well as a host of national and historical icons to join him in bringing everyone together to share the most-loved chops and cutlets. The advertisement opens on an open sea, with Captain Cook aboard his ship as he approaches the Australian shore line. His steely focus on the path ahead is interrupted by a phone call from Benaud inviting him to a 'barbie' at his place on Australia Day. 'Cooky' agrees, and asks if fellow explorers Burke and Wills are also on the guest list – they're keen, despite their death-bed-dire situation in a baking hot desert. Benaud captures the spirit by doing what every Aussies should be doing - organising a big lamb BBQ . Benaud captures the spirit of our national day by doing what we believe every Aussie should be doing on Australia Day; organising a big lamb BBQ and a game of backyard cricket . Benaud later looks worried when legendary outlaw Ned Kelly offers to 'round up the guys' for the occasion, although this is less worrying than the rumour that Kelly has gone 'veggo' (in fact he is just gluten intolerant). Other iconic Australians invited to Benaud's barbie include iconic cricketer Don Bradman, media giant Ita Buttrose, and of course Sam Kekovich. But when Billy Birmingham – famous for impersonating Benaud as the 12th Man – gets wind of the lamb feast, he's bluntly told by Benaud that there's nothing on. Benaud said: 'In addition to my love of cricket on Australia Day, I wanted to be involved in another key part of our national day, the iconic lamb campaign. The Today Show posted a photograph this month, with a caption: 'Never too many Richie Benauds!' A general view of spectators dressed as Richie Benaud during day two of the Fourth Test match between Australia and India at Sydney Cricket Ground on Wednesday . 'For me, this year's campaign encapsulates what Australia Day is all about; Australians getting together for a lamb BBQ.' General Manager Global Marketing at Meat & Livestock Australia Michael Edmonds said: 'As a nation we love our lamb, and it's our belief that you never lamb alone. 'That goes double on Australia Day. Benaud might not be at the cricket surrounded by his army of fans this year, but he's still making the most of the day and spending it with this pantheon of notable Australians.'

"Three teenage boys have been arrested for beating and fatally shooting a 14-year-old girl. Police said there is no apparent motive for the attack in Kansas City's Bay Water Park at 5am on January 11. The body of eighth grader Alexis Kane was found by a passer-by the next morning - just meters away from her middle school. Isaac Carter, 17, Ce-Antonyo Kennedy, 17, and Dominic McDaniel, 18, were charged with first-degree murder on Sunday after a two-week investigation. Tragic: Alexis Kane, 14, was pistol-whipped and shot dead in a park in Kansas City on January 11 . Charged: Isaac McDaniel, 18, and 17-year-olds Ce-Antonyo Kennedy and Isaac Carter are charged with first-degree murder after allegedly picking up Alexis in a white Chrysler then beating her in a nearby park . 'It’s senseless. Absolutely senseless,' Jackson County prosecutor Jean Peters Baker said as she announced the charges. 'I cannot give you a reason that makes any sense.' 'It’s really about as terrible as I can imagine,' Baker continued, according to The Kansas City Star. 'She was only 14. She deserved a long life.' Detectives are working to determine how Alexis met her alleged killers - the last of whom was arrested on Sunday. Surveillance footage allegedly shows Carter and McDaniel meeting Alexis in a white Chrysler at 4am outside a 7-Eleven. Video taken from Bay Water Park shows the group meeting Kennedy an hour later, where Alexis was beaten and shot dead, court documents say. Friends told investigators she had been communicating with a person named 'Malik Suckaface' on Facebook in the hours leading up to her death. Horrific: This is Bay Water Park, meters from Alexis's middle school, where her body was found by a walker . Grieving mother: LaShonda Kane was barely audible as she tearfully addressed reporters on Sunday . 'Senseless': Prosecutor Jean Baker said there is no clear motive for the attack as she announced the charges . She then asked for a ride to a 7-Eleven, where a white Chrysler was waiting, shortly before 4am on January 11. The friends said they told Alexis not to get in the car but she did. Despite attempting to follow the vehicle - allegedly driven by two men with dreadlocks - they lost track of it. Surveillance footage from Bay Water Park shows the car arrive in the parking lot at 5am on January 11, court documents state. Alexis emerges. She is then pistol-whipped and shot more than five times. Court documents suggest Carter and McDaniel picked up Alexis in the car and met Kennedy at the park. Kennedy, who was arrested the day after Alexis' murder, denied any involvement. He is accused of hitting the child with the pistol before firing five shots. Carter then took the gun and fired more shots, court documents state. McDaniel allegedly admitted to being in the car with Carter and Smith-Hale Middle School pupil Alexis. Speaking at Kansas City Police Headquarters, where all three suspects are in custody, the prosecutor described a 'very, very painful' meeting with Alexis' mother LaShonda Kane. Painful: Baker described a 'very, very painful' meeting with Alexis' family to discuss the case . Battling through: Alexis' aunt Shanaya Kane praised police effort to 'get those cowards of the streets' The Kansas City Star wrote that Mrs Kane addressed reporters in a 'barely audible voice' to say: 'This is the hardest thing I've ever had to do in my life.' 'I don't want you standing where I am today,' she added. A vigil was be held on the Thursday after Alexis's death at the water park where her body was found. It has taken police two weeks to trace the suspects. The AdHoc Group Against Crime offered a $1,000 reward for leads. Shanaya Kane, Alexis' aunt, praised detectives' efforts to get 'those cowards off the streets'. She told reporters their family has barely slept in the past two weeks.","Alexis Kane, 14, found dead in Kansas City's Bay Water Park, January 11 .

'But coming and tasting that kingfish and that beef was out of this world - I just want to put it into a bag and take it for dinner, but I don't think I would be allowed to do that.' After trying the food and wine, Camilla, who toured Australia with Prince Charles to mark the Queen's Jubilee in 2012, added: 'I hope to come and sample a lot more of it very soon.' And she joked: 'I will stagger out of here now.'","Duchess of Cornwall celebrated Australia Day at London engagement .

"Shannon Gee, 16, from Camborne, Cornwall, died two hours after overdosing on tablets, inquest told . A schoolgirl who was called a 'fat b***h' and told to lose weight by online bullies died two hours after overdosing on tablets, an inquest heard today. Shannon Gee, 16, walked downstairs and told her father she had 'done something silly' before showing him a bundle of empty pill packets which she had hidden in her bedroom cupboard. The teenager, from Camborne, Cornwall, collapsed shortly afterwards and was rushed to hospital but died from the incident in September 2012. During the first day of an inquest into her death, the hearing heard how Shannon had been mercilessly bullied at school which led to a poor attendance record and meant she rarely left her bedroom. But, despite hiding away, the aspiring actress was also targeted on Twitter and Facebook - battles which she fought 'from the safety of her own room', the inquest was told. Her mother Christine Gee said the problems had started when Shannon was diagnosed with dyslexia and the school 'shined a spotlight on her'. She said: 'The school was very quick to recognise that she displayed some of the common symptoms. But they ultimately succeeded in shining a spotlight on her. 'The other schoolchildren clearly gave their opinions and suggested that she was thick and that she was only getting help because she was the teachers' pet.' In a statement read to the hearing, she added how Shannon was a 'curvy girl' who had been picked on due to her weight . 'She used Twitter, Facebook and other social media facilities to communicate. I know she found herself on the receiving end of some heartless comments,' she said. 'She was a curvy girl. She was called a 'fat b***h,' a 'fat cow' and was told to lose some weight. She fought these little battles from the safety of her own room.' Shannon's half-brother Christopher Harrison, who spent an hour with her on the morning of her death, told the inquest how Shannon had been worried about the bullying. 'There was stuff going on with the school. It was bullying,' he said. 'People were calling her fat and things and she was worrying about her weight. 'I think she had fallen out with one of her main friends which had upset her quite a lot.' Her mother had told the inquest how Shannon, a keen drama student, was 'loving and generous' and had hoped to move to New York one day. But, in the months before her death, Shannon had also been worried by family tensions and the well-being of 'significant adults' in her life, the hearing heard. The inquest also heard how she had become an 'agony aunt' for her peers at the Pool Academy, where she went to school. Her mother added: 'These burdens became too much for her to bear. But it was damned if you do and damned if you don't.' The teenager attended Pool Academy (pictured), west Cornwall, where it is alleged she was bullied by her peers. The inquest heard she was also targeted online - battles she fought 'from the safety of her own room' The day before her death in September 2012, Shannon went to Plymouth to go shopping with a friend. She spent the night at the friend's house before returning home on the Sunday. While at home, her half-brother, a shop assistant, added that Shannon was 'not really talking' and was 'very quiet and tired'. He said: 'If there was anything she would not have told me. She had issues and things that she needed to talk about to do with the family and with school.' She told her father that night how she did not want to go to school the next day, the hearing heard. Hours later, Shannon had collapsed and was taken to Royal Cornwall Hospital, Truro, where she died. In a statement, her father Paul told the inquest: 'She seemed quite assertive and there was no shortage of other future plans. She would have known full well that we would not have made her go to school. 'There was nothing about her demeanor that suggested she had already taken any tablets.' Talking about the pills, he added: 'I have no idea how she got hold of them or how long she had been storing them. She was very unclear about how many she had taken.' Heather Campbell, a specialist social worker who worked with Shannon, said the teenager was first referred to Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services in 2011. She was referred for a second time in February 2012 and went to four further appointments. Ms Campbell said Shannon had talked about different concerns in her personal life, including an allegation of rape between two people she knew well, self-harm and her mother and father arguing. She said: 'She talked quite a lot about the difficulties and the stress relating to her family life. She disclosed that living at home had become ""unbearable"".' She added that Shannon told her that she 'wanted to try' self-harm, saying: 'Shannon wanted to see what it was like but said that she would never do it again. She had thoughts about what it would be like to be dead but not about doing it.' After that, Shannon's appointments were stopped over the summer holidays and organised to start again in September. The four-day inquest at Truro City Hall (pictured) heard how the student had hopes to move to New York one day. The hearing heard she died at Royal Cornwall Hospital after collapsing at home following an overdose . The hearing heard how Shannon's desperate father had phoned Ms Campbell to ask if they could move the appointment forward as his daughter 'wasn't doing very well'. He also took her to the GP and visited her school. But the inquest heard how a phone message left by the organisation after the summer holidays was never returned. Shannon did not attend another appointment. After Shannon's death, a serious case review was launched. It found that there was action or omission by the services that led to Shannon's death. But Ms Campbell told the inquest how Shannon had been 'thriving' at their last meeting. She said: 'I believe the way forward for Shannon was what she was asking for. She was looking forward and moving on. 'She was really engaged and insightful. I think there are lessons to be learned but I do not think I could have done anything at the time. 'At the last meeting she was thriving. She was doing really well and moving forward.' Both of Shannon's parents have been excused from attending the inquest due to illness. The four-day hearing in her death, held at Cornwall Coroner's Court, continues.

"With cities all along the Philadelphia-to-Boston corridor preparing for a potentially historic storm, Uber has announced that it is suspending price surges during the storm in accordance with an agreement made with New York's attorney general last year. Uber, which uses a mobile application to connect riders with vehicles for hire, has its rates rise and fall with demand, but it has been criticized for 'surge pricing' that's sometimes exponentially higher than base fares. After charging eight times normal fares during snowstorms in New York in late 2013, Uber agreed last July to limit prices during emergencies, natural disasters or other unusual market disruptions consistent with a state law against price gouging. Scroll down for video . With cities such as New York preparing for a potentially historic storm, Uber has announced that it is suspending price surges during the storm . The San Francisco-based company also instituted the same cap policy nationally and agreed to donate commissions on surge trips, or 20 percent of the total fare on trips with elevated pricing, to the American Red Cross. 'Dynamic pricing will be capped and all Uber proceeds will be donated to the American Red Cross to support relief efforts,' the company reiterated in a statement on Monday. Under the agreement, Uber will set a cap during 'abnormal disruptions of the market,' limited to the range of prices charged in the preceding 60 days and excluding the three highest prices. During those times, businesses are prohibited from charging 'unconscionably excessive prices' for essential consumer goods or services. Uber, which uses a mobile application to connect riders with vehicles for hire, has its rates rise and fall with demand, but it has been criticized for 'surge pricing' that's sometimes exponentially higher than base fares . Snow predictions as of Monday afternoon reveal that several feet is set to blanket the Northeast along with high winds that will create 'life-threatening' whiteout conditions, according to the National Weather Service . The company has previously claimed that its surge-pricing algorithm helped encourage drivers to respond to increased requests during peak hours, in inclement weather and on holidays. But huge hikes  also led to accusations that the company was simply seeking to benefit from others' misfortune. There was outrage after the company's surge pricing model kicked-in in Sydney during a hostage crisis in December, in which a gunman held occupants in a cafe for about 17 hours. The National Weather Service is predicting that 2 to 3 feet of snow will fall in a 250-mile stretch of the Northeast, including the New York and Boston areas.

"On trial: Captain Francesco Schettino, who was in charge of the cruise ship Costa Concordia when it steered into rocks and sank at the cost of 32 lives . The captain who piloted the cruise ship Costa Concordia onto rocks off Tuscany, killing 32, should serve 26 years in jail, prosecutors said today. The trial of Captain Francesco Schettino had proved he 'thought only and always about himself,' said prosecutor Maria Navarro in scathing closing statements. She told the makeshift courthouse in Grosetto that Schettina had lied from the start, never apologised to the victims and saved his own life 'without even getting his shoes wet'. Calling him a flight risk, she asked the court to detain him again and seize his passport and navigation licence. Schettino is being tried for manslaughter, causing the shipwreck and abandoning the Concordia while many passengers and crew members were still aboard. Survivors of the January 13, 2012, wreck described a chaotic and delayed evacuation, with lifeboats unable to lower because the ship was already listing so much. Ms Navarro said the requested sentence, beyond the 20-year maximum speculated, was not 'exaggerated' considering Italy's high court recently confirmed a 10-year prison sentence for a car accident that killed four people. The defense is expected to respond in court starting February 9, with a verdict expected thereafter. Schettino claims he saved lives by steering the liner to shore after it hit uncharted rocks. He accuses his crew of botching his orders and blamed faulty generators aboard the ship for contributing to the disaster. Defense lawyer Donato Laino was incredulous at the prosecutors' request to re-arrest Schettino, saying the flight risk was 'nonexistent.' Slammed: Schettino arrives in court with his lawyer, where he heard the prosecution alleged he had lied from the start, never apologised to the victims and saved his own life 'without even getting his shoes wet' Shipwrecked on the Italian coast: In this file photo taken on January 14, 2012, the luxury cruise ship Costa Concordia lays on its side after running aground the tiny Tuscan island of Giglio, Italy . Schettino was granted house arrest soon after the wreck, and later was allowed to remain in his hometown near Naples during the course of the trial. He has attended most court sessions, though he was absent today. Five other Costa Crociere employees indicted in the case were allowed to enter plea bargains and none is serving prison time.","Capt Francesco Schettino is savaged in prosecution closing statements .

"Fire crews recovered Monday the sixth and final body from the charred remains of a Maryland mansion a week after it was destroyed by a devastating fire. Anne Arundel Fire Department spokesman Capt. Russ Davies said that investigators pulled the remains of the final victim from the ruins in Annapolis and that all occupants are now accounted for. Five bodies were found last week. However, none of the victims have been officially identified. The $9million, 16,000-square-foot mansion owned by Don and Sandra Pyle near Annapolis caught fire early January 19. Scroll down for videos . Closure: Sisters Alexis 'Lexi' Boone, 8 (left), and Kaitlyn 'Katie' Boone, 7 (right), are believed to be among the six family members whose bodies have been pulled from the rubble of a burned-down Annapolis mansion . Tragic victims: Siblings Charlotte Boone, 8 (left), and Wesley Boone, 6, (right) were in the house with their cousins and grandparents when the fire broke out January 19 . Family night: Grandparents Don and Sandy Pyle had their four grandchildren over for a sleepover . Wreck: Two bodies were recovered Thursday afternoon in the rubble of a multimillion-dollar mansion in Annapolis that burned to the ground earlier this week. Two remain unaccounted for . Relatives had said they believe the Pyles and their four young grandchildren were inside at the time and perished in the blaze. The four children were over at the grandparents' home for a sleepover following a dinner and a show at the theme restaurant Medieval Times in Hanover. Davis said investigators are expected to continue probing the site another two days. The cause of the fire remains under investigation. According to relatives, the young victims were cousins, with the sons of Sandra Pyle and step-sons of Don Pyle, Randy and Clint Boone, each having two children. All four were in staying at the Maryland home January 18, with the fire believed to have broken out about 3.30am on Monday. Crews continued to search the Maryland mansion for bodies on Thursday, saying that they hoped to give the devastated families closure as soon as possible . Alexis  Boone, eight, Kaitlyn  Boone, seven, Charlotte Boone, eight, and six-year-old Wesley Boone were missing following the fire at their grandparents' Annapolis mansion, their family said Wednesday . Firefighters  took about 10 hours to extinguish hot spots on Monday and one area flared up on Tuesday again. Trapped: Don and Sandra Pyle (pictured), were at home at the time of the fire with their grandchildren: Alexis Boone, 8; Kaitlyn Boone, 7; Charlotte Boone, 8; and Wesley Boone, 6. The children's names were listed as Alexis (Lexi) Boone,8; Kaitlyn (Katie) Boone, 7; Charlotte Boone, 8, and six-year-old Wesley Boone. Eve Morrison, the wife of Clint Boone, and the mother of Charlotte and Wesley, posted a message to Facebook about the tragedy Thursday. The mesage read: 'Clint and I would like to thank everyone again for all of your messages and support. It means so much to us all at this time. I am trying to read all the messages and thank you so much for reaching out to us. Although way too short, our babies lives were incredibly happy and they were loved by so many. Thank you everyone so very much. Love to all. XOXO' The post went on: 'And of course Don and Sandy ""Dee Dee and Pop Pop"" the two most incredible, generous, hilarious people anyone could ever know. I am thankful for the 16 years I had with them too, as I'm sure everyone else who had the pleasure of knowing them is as well. According to The Baltimore Sun, Randy and Stacey Boone, parents of Lexi and Katie, have a three-week-old son who was not at the Pyles' home on the night of the tragedy. An earlier family statement given to WUSA9 read: 'On behalf of the Boone and Pyle families, we wish to express our gratitude and appreciation for the love and support being shared with us during this tragic event. We are blessed that so many family, friends, and neighbors have come together for us in our time of need. Emotional: The message put on Facebook by Eve Morrison, mother to two of the child victims, Charlotte, 8, and Wesley Boone, 6 . 'We recognize the dedicated efforts from Anne Arundel County Fire and Police Departments, the Naval Academy, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms, and other first responders. We want our community to know how proud we are of all who have helped us. 'Our love for our family is boundless. Our loss demands time and quiet reflection to process these feelings. We ask that you respect our need for privacy. 'Life is fragile. Make time today to embrace your loved ones.' Investigators last Wednesday found two bodies  in the charred remains of the home in Annapolis, after the property burned to the ground. The bodies were with the medical examiner and have not yet been identified. It is not known whether the bodies were of children or adults. Tech tycoon Don Pyle, 56, lived in the sprawling 16,000-square-foot waterfront home with his wife, Sandra. Three people embrace outside the gates of the home, where Investigators found the bodies of two unidentified people on Wednesday . Don and Sandra Pyle were home the night of the blaze along with their four grandchildren . 'I never knew that I could hurt this badly,' Stacey Boone, mother to Lexi and Katie with Sandra Pyle's son Randy Boone, wrote on Facebook last Tuesday. 'It’s unreal. All one big nightmare that I can’t wake up from.' The Pyles and their four grandchildren have been missing since crews were called early last Monday. The fire was reported about 3.30am on Monday by an alarm-monitoring company and a neighbor who spotted flames. Officials said it is unclear whether an alarm sounded inside the home, which might have alerted anyone inside. Some 85 firefighters from several jurisdictions fought the fire. Because there was no hydrant in the area, firefighters shuttled tankers to the site and stationed a fire boat at a pier nearby. Davies said hot spots took about 10 hours to extinguish Monday. One area flared up on Tuesday, and Davies said crews were monitoring it and extinguishing it as needed. Special Agent David Cheplak, a spokesman for the ATF's Baltimore field office, said earlier this week there were no immediate signs of foul play. Mansion fire: The $9million home in Annapolis, Maryland, caught fire around 3:30am Monday . Picturesque: In 2008, Pyle said the house had been built to be a combination of a castle and a beach house . Sources at the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives told CNN that the fire engulfed the mansion so fast that they suspect that chemicals may have been used to accelerate the burning. The official in charge of the ATF's investigation would not confirm whether the blaze was suspicious to DailyMail.com. Capt. Robert Howarth, commander of the county fire department's fire and explosives investigation unit, said on Tuesday that investigators were treating the site as a crime scene. Howarth said that is a common practice when there are no eyewitnesses, and it means only that anything recovered in the investigation would be admissible in court. Neighbor Caroline Wugofski said the Pyles often held parties at their home. She described them as 'genuinely nice people'.

The image above was taken in 2012 . Inferno: The blaze, pictured from the air, tore through the home. Bottom right, firefighters can be seen standing near the pools as they spray water at the ruins . Don Pyle grew up in nearby Baltimore County and worked his way to the top table of several billion-dollar tech companies. In a recent interview with the Washington Post, he said he started off as a salesman, and moved to progressively more important roles before taking the reins at companies with links to Silicon Valley. His latest role was as the COO of ScienceLogic, an IT support company based in Reston, Virginia. He would hold fundraisers for worthy causes at his house. At one in 2008, he told the Baltimore Sun the house had been especially designed to be a combination of a castle, his preference and a beach house, which Sandra wanted. His lavish property stood facing Church Creek, a picturesque inlet not far from the Chesapeake Bay. It has an estimated $9million value. Situated on its own portion of exclusive Childs Point Road, the home boasted a courtyard, swimming pool and access to a speedboat jetty. Real estate listings for the home say it had seven bathrooms and was part of a 7.8-acre estate. The modern, two-storey home, which was built in 2005, also has attic space and a basement. Photographs of the mansion before it burned down show at least four cars parked outside the elegant stone construction, which has several turrets as part of its architecture. ScienceLogic would only confirm that Pyle works for them. A spokesman told DailyMail.com: 'Don Pyle is the Chief Operating Officer for ScienceLogic. 'There was a fire at his home last night and the case is under investigation. We have no further comment.'","Alexis (Lexi) Boone, 8; Kaitlyn (Katie) Boone, 7; Charlotte Boone, 8, and six-year-old Wesley Boone are believed to have perished in the blaze .

"It's been 21 years since Today show hosts Katie Couric and Bryant Gumbel quizzically asked 'what is internet, anyway?' when confronted with their first email address live on air. Now, they're back poking fun at their infamous gaffe in a new commercial for BMW's i3 electric car. The ad - which will air during the Super Bowl this Sunday - begins with the 1994 Today show clip in which Couric and Gumbel are visibly confused after being made to read an email address for the first time. They both seem hung up on the @ symbol. 'What is i3'? Katie Couric and Bryant Gumbel team up again to play baffled curmudgeons in a new BMW ad called 'Newfangled Idea' Couric and Gumbel in 1994 were hilariously confused when confronted with their first email address live on air at the Today show . 'I wasn't prepared to translate that. That little mark with the 'A' and then the ring around it,' Gumbel says. '... Katie says she thought it was about.' 'Or around. Around or about,' Couric chimes in. Gumbel then asks: 'What is internet, anyway? What do you do, write to it like mail?' The i3 is BMW's new electric car, built from carbon-fiber instead of steel and made in factories powered by wind turbines . Couric returned to the Today show on Monday to talk about the infamous segment and her new BMW ad . Couric then asks a producer: 'Alison, can you explain what internet is?' Couric appeared on the Today show Monday to talk about the commercial and the clueless clip that has since become internet lore. 'There's people who look back and say that in hindsight, there was this transitional technology,"" she said. 'It was really so new back then and then we see how it evolved.' Fast forward to 2015, Gumbel and Couric seem equally baffled as they sit behind the wheel of a new i3 electric car. 'What do you mean there's nothing under the hood? Katie said she thought this was a car,' Gumbel says. He then asks: 'What is i3, anyway?' Couric gets on her cellphone and says: 'Allison, can you explain what i3 is?' The tagline to the spot is: 'Big ideas take a little getting used to.' The 1994 clip is especially ironic now that Couric, who jumped to CBS and then ABC after leaving the Today show in 2006, hosts an online-only news cast for Yahoo! News. Yahoo.com wasn't even a registered internet domain in January 1994 when Couric and Gumbel bumbled their way through their first email address on air.

"Global warming is claimed to be already posing problems for polar bears, whose numbers are waning because of melting ice, dangerous conditions and fewer hunting opportunities. Now experts have warned that chemical pollutants may be reducing the density of the bears’ penis bones. This puts them at risk of breaking their penis, which could have disastrous consequences for mating and the survival of the endangered species. Not in rude health: Scientists have warned that chemical pollutants may be reducing the density of polar bears' penis bones. This puts the them at risk of breaking their penis, which could have disastrous consequences for mating and the survival of the endangered species (stock image) Mammals such as otters have a penis bone, or baculum, which is thought to be a by-product of evolution, although experts are not sure. Now, a team of scientists led by Christian Sonne at Aarhus University, Denmark, has found that a certain type of pollutant called polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) is associated with a less dense penile bone, New Scientist reported. They have previously shown bears that have high levels of pollutants named organohalogens, such as PCBs, in their bodies, have smaller than average penis bones and testes. Organohalogens contain at least one halogen such as fluorine or chlorine, and are used as solvents and pesticides, as well as in the making of dyes and drugs. PCBs were used to make paints and rubber goods in the 1930s, but were banned in 2001 after scientists discovered they can cause cancer. The connection: A team of scientists led by Christian Sonne at Aarhus University, Denmark, have found that a certain type of pollutant called polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are associated with a less dense penile bone. An illustration of a toxic PCB 126 molecule is shown . Uncertain future: Global warming is already posing problems for polar bears, whose numbers are waning thanks to melting ice, dangerous conditions and fewer hunting opportunities. A stock image is shown . Because they break down slowly, they can still be found in the Arctic, meaning that animals such as polar bears are especially at risk. Together with a team from Canada, Dr Sonne examined buculum specimens from 279 polar bears that were born in north-east Greenland and Canada between 1990 and 2000. They used X-rays to study the density of calcium in the bones and then compared their findings with regional pollutant data. Experts have previously shown that bears that have high levels of pollutants  in their bodies, have smaller than average penis bone. A collection of ancient bones is shown . The team discovered a connection between low bone density and high PCB levels, but stressed that their findings are not strong enough to prove that the pollutants are the cause of the problem. While experts are unsure of the exact purpose of the bacculum in polar bear mating, Dr Sonne thinks that a weaker bone could prove problematic, because if it breaks, it will likely stop a male from mating. While no extensive studies in the wild have been done to understand the effect pollutants on polar bear populations - because they are difficult and expensive - Dr Sonne thinks chemicals have probably killed a lot of bears in recent decades. He even believes PCBs, for example, may have cause changes to the bear’s genes. It’s already been found that thin bears have higher levels of pollutants in their bodies, so some experts fear that hungry bears may be more vulnerable to the effects of chemicals such as PCBs. In 2013, scientists uncovered a worrying trend in 'shrinking' penis bones in otters, possibly caused by chemicals. Experts at Cardiff University and the Chemicals, Health and Environment Monitoring (CHEM) Trust suggested a link between hormone disrupting chemicals and problems with male reproductive health. Experts studying the reproductive health of the mammals in England and Wales were concerned to find a decrease in the weight of otters' penis bones. Other health problems in males included an increase in undescended testicles and cysts on sperm-carrying tubes.

Experts suggested a link between hormone disrupting chemicals and problems with male reproductive health . Scientists recently warned that a a quarter of Canadian polar bears could be wiped out by the end of the century because of shrinking ice caps. Warming temperatures could destroy one tenth of the bear’s habitat, affecting their ability to roam across huge expanses of ice to hunt for food. Biologists from the University of Alberta believe that as summers get warmer in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago - islands off the North American continent and Greenland – more permanent ice cover will melt away every year. Scientists have warned that a quarter of Canadian polar bears (pictured) could be wiped out by the end of the century because of shrinking ice caps. Warming temperatures could destroy one tenth of the bear’s habitat, affecting their ability to roam across huge expanses of ice to hunt for food and mate . This means that by 2100, each polar bear population in the Archipelago may have to endure between two and five months of the year without ice at sea, which would likely lead to starvation and hamper their ability to mate. Projected global warming would adversely affect one tenth of their habitat, which is being damaged by man-made pollution, according to the study. It found that sea ice across the Arctic is declining and altering the physical characteristics of marine ecosystems . The study, published in Plos One, used sea ice projections from 2006 to 2100 to gain an insight into the conservation challenges for polar bears. Biologists from the University of Alberta believe that as summers get warmer in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago (mapped) - islands off the North American continent and Greenland – more permanent ice cover will melt away every year .","Researchers at Aarhus University, Denmark, found that pollutants called polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are linked with a less dense penile bone .

"The Government's inquiry into historic child abuse should be scrapped and started again, a leading member of the panel overseeing the investigation has told MPs. Ben Emmerson QC, the leading lawyer advising the inquiry, said the Home Secretary needed to disband it and set up a new investigation with statutory powers to compel people to give evidence. He said the abuse inquiry had been undermined by internal leaks by a leading member of the panel and could no longer do its job. Mr Emerson's remarks comes six months after the Home Secretary Theresa May first announced the inquiry. Home Affairs Select Committee chairman Keith Vaz published information leaked by the child abuse inquiry . But it has been beset by problems and has been without a chairman since November after Fiona Woolf resigned over links to the late Tory peer Lord Brittan, whose handling of abuse claims in the 1980s has been questioned. Predecessor Baroness Butler-Sloss had resigned four months earlier, also over her links with establishment figures. Mr Emmerson was last week accused of 'bullying' child abuse survivor Sharon Evans, who sits on the inquiry board. Mrs Evans told MPs on the Home Affairs Select Committee last Tuesday that Mr Emmerson was 'overstepping the mark with advice and rewriting of letters'. The allegations prompted the chair of the committee, Keith Vaz, to summon the barrister to answer questions on his role in the inquiry. Speaking this afternoon, Mr Emmerson said panel members' letters 'were not my responsibility', and accused Ms Evans of publishing 'misleading statements that have had an impact on the work of the inquiry'. Ben Emmerson QC, the leading lawyer advising the inquiry, said the Home Secretary needed to disband it and set up a new investigation because information had been leaked . Member of the Independent panel inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse Sharon Evans has been accused of leaking information . He also claimed his fellow panel member was behind the 'leaking' of a Home Office letter sent to panel members on December 15. In a frank exchange between Mr Emmerson and the committee chair, the human rights lawyer accused Ms Evans of a 'breach of confidentiality', describing the row as a 'terrible distraction from the really crucial and vitally important work that the panel has been trying to do in difficult circumstances'. In earlier responses to Ms Evans accusations, the remaining members of the inquiry said they had 'full confidence in the integrity, advice and impartiality' of the lawyer in his role as 'facilitator' while a new chair is appointed. Mr Emmerson also rejected claims that he had 'intimidated' Ms Evans as 'entirely baseless' and 'unfounded'. The government inquiry into child abuse has been without a chairman since November after Fiona Woolf resigned over links to the late Tory peer Lord Brittan (above) Fiona Woolf (left) resigned as committee chair - becoming the second inquiry head chosen by Theresa May (right) to step down . The leaked letter last week revealed that the Home Secretary Theresa May was considering disbanding the panel. Mrs May could set up a new inquiry panel under statutory terms. In a letter to the panel members, she said: 'I am currently considering these options and I appreciate this has implications for members of the panel.' Mrs Emmerson said it is his assessment that the panel cannot do its work because of Evans conduct. Although she is a survivor herself, what she has done has not served the interests of survivors, he said.","Ben Emmerson said Theresa May needed to disband the inquiry's panel .

"A woman has shared the shocking story of how she was sexually abused by her father and had his baby when she was a teenager. Helen Rees (not her real name) agreed to appear on today's This Morning and be interviewed by presenters Phillip Schofield and Christine Bleakley on the condition she would not be identified. Speaking to them with her face turned away from the cameras, she revealed how she and her younger sister and older brother grew up In Ireland in fear of their father. Scroll down for video . Ordeal: Helen Rees (not her real name) agreed to appear on today's This Morning and be interviewed by presenters Phillip Schofield and Christine Bleakley . Their mother had left them, leaving them with the 'frightening' man who had mental health issues. She said: 'I saw him as a very dark figure, very frightening. I could hear him talking to himself a lot, he was crazy, he thought the house was bugged.' Helen said he treated his son and daughters 'like animals'. They had no bedding and only ate bread and potatoes while he had 'fancy food'. He would torment them by buying pick n' mix sweets and eating them in front of them. But his abuse was also far more violent and sinister than that. Helen recalled: 'There was a lot of physical abuse, he would hit us with poker, a belt, or with a branch on the back of our legs. My sister and I dressed like old women in long skirts to hide the bruises. Sometimes he would force our brother to beat us.' Helen said she was just five years old when the abuse became sexual and her father started visiting her at night. 'He was the boss, I didn't know any different,' she said. She said she was too scared to tell anyone what was happening. 'He warned me ""if you lose me, you'll be locked up in an institution and the key will be thrown away"",' she explained. Don't suffer in silence: Helen is urging other victims to speak out . As a result, Helen endured the abuse for years. Then at the age of 14, she was stunned to discover she was pregnant. 'He told me I couldn't get pregnant because he was my father. I believed that, it was such a shock,' she said when she found out she was expecting. 'I didn't know what was going on. He shouted at me and said ""why didn't you take precautions?""' she said of her father's reaction. He tried to arrange for her to have abortion but by the time Helen realised she was pregnant, it was too late for a termination. When her daughter, Sarah, arrived, Helen said she was her 'pride and joy.' But because she was still 14 and they had nowhere to go, she had to take her baby back to live with her father. It was when she saw him acting suspiciously with the child that she knew she had to get them both away from him. I went out and came back to see him with the baby, her nappy was open, he was rubbing his hands together and he looked guilty, ""what are you doing?"" I shouted at him. I knew then I had to get out of there, I thought ""could this really happen to a little baby?""' She reported her father for what he had done to her but he was deemed unfit to stand trial because of his mental health. He was put into psychiatric care until he died. Helen tried her best to move on and give her daughter a happy life. She never intended to tell Sarah the truth about who her father was - but she found out when she was a teenager after she discovered hidden paperwork relating to her grandfather. Discovering the truth led to her feeling betrayed by her mother. 'For a period, she hated me,' Helen said. 'She shut down and stopped dealing with her emotions.' Helen wonders if things would had been different if she had told Sarah the truth earlier. Their relationship is slowly improving and Sarah is happier and travelling the world. Speaking of why she has chosen to share her story, Helen said she hopes it will encourage other victims to speak out sooner than she did. 'Tell someone, get it out there,' she urged. 'Don't live with abuse and remember it's not your fault.'","Helen Rees (not her real name) appeared on today's This Morning .

"A New York artist has made his feelings for Mark Zuckerberg  clear after painting a portrait of the Facebook founder using his own excrement. Brooklyn-based artist KATSU used his own faeces to create a likeness of the Facebook CEO which has been put on display at a local art gallery, surrounded by blinking neon lights. This is not the first time KATSU has hit out at Zuckerberg using his art, and has often criticised the way Facebook uses personal data. One way to make a statement: Brooklyn-based artist KATSU painted this portrait of Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg using his own faeces . Two years ago the artist decorated New York City with posters showing the Facebook founder with a black eye and a chipped tooth.

'I'm upset and confused. I want the ability for people to permanently remove their information from Facebook… . 'I want Facebook to adequately explain to all users the extent to which their data will be farmed out and shared. Likeness? The portrait of Zuckerberg is exhibited at The Hole gallery in Manhattan .

"A woman has been handed five consecutive life sentences for sexually abusing a 10-year-old male relative in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Melissa Kay Anderson, 35, pleaded no contest to assaulting the child and forcing him to watch her have sex with her boyfriend. She also forced her victim to use sex toys on her, and showed him pornography. 'Heinous': A judge said Melissa Kay Anderson, 35, 'should not breathe fresh air again' as she was handed five life sentences for sexually abusing a 10-year-old male relative and forcing him to watch her have sex . Passing sentence based on the 'heinous' nature of the crime, Tulsa City Assistant District Attorney Kevin Gray said: 'I don't believe Ms Anderson should breathe fresh air again.' Her boyfriend and co-defendant Michael Burris has pleaded not guilty to one count of child sexual abuse and one count of allowing child sexual abuse. Anderson was arrested in September after the victim told his father about the assault, Tulsa World reported. She was charged with five counts of child sex abuse, to which she pleaded guilty in November. The trial revealed Anderson was 'high on methamphetamine' during a number of the assaults. Also accused: Anderson's boyfriend Michael Burris has pleaded not guilty to assaulting the child . Defending, Chuck Sullivan said Anderson was abused as a child and said a life sentence would be a second 'failure of the system'. According to The Examiner, police said the 10-year-old 'is a total hero to speak out when he did and to tell his story, and that's to be commended.' Burris is being held on a $1 million bond.

The movies will be made exclusively for Oculus' VR platform and will not come in a traditional 2-D or 3-D format, Iribe said. VR allows for a larger degree of interactivity than traditional cinema -paths can be explored and characters may materialize depending on where a viewer chooses to look.

"Jailed: Jodi Russell, 28, from Dudley, West Midands was sentenced to 20 weeks behind bars for causing unnecessary suffering to the dogs . A mother-of-four who starved her two dogs and left them trapped in urine-soaked cages has been jailed for animal cruelty as a judge called the case 'one of the worst the court had seen'. Jodi Russell, 28, from Dudley, West Midands, left her pets in such shocking conditions that one died within 24 hours of being rescued by RSPCA inspectors - who discovered the animals 14 months ago. The dogs were found 'lifeless' in their cages as Russell's children played around them in the living room - and were given the lowest possible condition ratings by vets. Russell is facing five months in jail after being found guilty of causing unnecessary suffering to the dogs and four charges of failing in her duty as owner at Dudley Magistrates' Court in August 2013. She was also given a lifetime ban from looking after animals or being associated with them in any way after Magistrate Neville Jinks expressed his horror at the case. Mr Jinks told the court: 'This is one of the worst cases of animal cruelty this court has seen for a very long time. 'I understand you were suffering from emotional difficulties at the time, but this is no excuse for letting the two dogs suffer the way they did. 'I have no choice but to give you a custodial sentence.' One of the dogs, named Storm, was described by a vet as the thinnest he had ever seen - and it died of starvation within 24 hours of being rescued. 'Lifeless': The starving animals were trapped in urine-soaked cages when RSPCA investigators found them . Starved: The caged dogs were found 'lifeless' as Russell's children played around them in the living room . The other - which had been treated the same way - survived and was later re-homed. The court heard how RSPCA charity inspector Steven Morrell found the dogs starving and in urine-soaked cages in the living room of Russell's home while children played around them. Daryll Foster, defending, said Russell was suffering emotionally at the time she was looking after the dogs, following the death of her much-loved father and after splitting up with her partner. Died: Storm, a male Staffordshire bull terrier died of starvation within 24 hours of being rescued and was described by a vet as the thinnest dog he had ever seen . Neglected: Russell was also given a lifetime ban from looking after animals or being associated with them in any way at Dudley Magistrates' Court . He said: 'Miss Russell, in hindsight, now accepts what she has done wrong and realises she should have made steps much earlier and is now a much better person than before.' Speaking after the sentencing, RSPCA spokesman Andy Robbins described the two dogs' suffering as 'shocking'. He said: 'RSPCA inspectors deal with truly horrific cases of neglect, but it is always upsetting to see animals in such poor condition as these. Rescued: The tan-coloured female Staffordshire bull terrier survived and was later re-homed after being found by RSPCA inspectors . 'Anyone can see simply from looking at the sorry images presented as part of the case that this was a matter where a shocking level of cruelty had taken place. 'We hope that the court's decision means no other animal will suffer at the hands of the defendant in this case.' Russell will serve a 20-week sentence for all offences, which will run concurrently. Shocking: The magistrate called it 'one of the worst cases of animal cruelty this court has seen for a very long time'","Jodi Russell, of West Midlands, left dogs to die in their cages in living room .

"If Saturday's Iowa Freedom Summit had an award for the 'most improved' presidential hopeful, Carly Fiorina would win hands-down: She was an unknown when she took the stage but became the talk of Des Moines after a speech that included plain-spoken attacks on likely Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. The former Hewlett-Packard CEO entered to polite applausebut left to raucous cheers, as the thousand-plus conservatives gathered to hear from big political names on the right identified a woman they can rally behind. Clinton, the former secretary of state, is expected to use her globetrotting experience as a prime qualification for winning the Oval Office – and Fiorina, it turns out, can match her. 'Like Hillary Clinton, I too have travelled hundreds of thousands of miles around the globe,' she said Saturday. 'But unlike her, I have actually accomplished something.' 'Mrs. Clinton, flying is an activity – not an accomplishment,' Fiorina exclaimed to applause. Scroll down for video . ANTIDOTE TO HILLARY CLINTON? Former H-P CEO Carly Fiorina made a name for herself Saturday in Iowa by targeting the former secretary of state head-on . 'Flying is an activity, not an accomplishment,' Fiorina jabbed, winning huge applause from conservative partisans . IN YOUR FACE: Fiorina made headlines last week for confronting White House adviser Valerie Jarrett over the Obama administration's record of paying female employees less than men . 'What difference, at this point, does it make?' Clinton famously snapped in a 2013 Senate hearing when confronted with the tall tale that an anti-Islam YouTube video, not a terror plot, sparked the death and destruction in Sept. 11, 2012 . 'I have met Vladimir Putin and know that it will take more to halt his ambitions than a gimmicky red ""reset"" button. Having done business in over 80 countries and having served as the Chairman of the External Advisory Board at the CIA, I know that China is a state-sponsor of cyberwarfare and has a strategy to steal our intellectual property.' The 'reset button' episode was one of Clinton's early embarrassments at the State Department. In 2009 she appeared in Geneva, Swltzerland with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and famously presented him with a prop red button labeled 'reset' in English and 'peregruzka' in Russian. 'We want to reset our relationship, and so we will do it together,' she said then. But the Russian word was misspelled – it should have read 'perezagruzka.' Instead, a stick-on label used the word meaning 'overcharged.' The embarrassing moment is one of many that Republicans will likely turn into television ads if Clinton continues to lead the Democratic field going into 2016. Fiorina also jabbed Clinton over the Obama administration's patience with Iran as it resists attempts to dismantle its nuclear program. 'I know Bibi Netanyahu,' she said, using the Israeli Prime Minister's familiar nickname, 'and know that when he warns us, over and over and over again, that Iran is a danger to this nation as well as to his own, that we must listen.' And in a coup de grace, Fiorina hammered Hillary for her now infamous meltown moment during January, 2013 testimony before a Senate panel about the terror attack in Benghazi, Libya four months earlier. 'RESET': Fiorina took aim at Hillary Clinton and the 'reset' button she infamously gave Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov in 2009 . DOES THE STATE DEPT. HAVE TRANSLATORS? Instead of reading 'perezagruzka' – the Russian word for 'reset' – a stick-on label used the word 'peregruzka' was used, which actually meant 'overcharged' Faced with pre-election national outrage over a coordinated military-stye assault on an American diplomatic compound and the death of U.S. Ambassdor to Libya Christopher Stevens, the Obama administration had blamed his death and three others on a spontaneous protest supposedly inspired by an anti-Islam YouTube video. 'The fact is, we had four dead Americans,' Clinton exploded during a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing. 'Was it because of a protest or because of guys out for a walk one night who decide to kill some Americans? What difference, at this point, does it make?' Fiorina brought the episode back from her audience's mental archives. 'Unlike Hillary Clinton I know what difference it makes that our Ambassador to Libya and three other brave Americans were killed in a deliberate terrorist attack on the anniversary of 9/11,' she said, 'and that the response of our nation must be more forceful that the arrest of a single individual a year later.' The line brought the house down. Fiorina is no political neophyte – she ran unsuccessfully against California Democratic Sen. Barbara Boxer in 2012. But outside California, she didn't sink into Americans' political consciousness. That will likely change if her Des Moines ovations are a fair prediction. Will Rogers, the local Republican Party chairman in Polk County, Iowa, told Daily Mail Online that Fiorina could become a breakout star in the early going. 'People need to take her very seriously,' he said. Maxwell claims State Department higher-ups close to then-Secretary Hillary Clinton worked over a weekend to scrub boxes of documents of anything that might make her look bad, before giving them to investigators . Fiorina will be back in Iowa in mid-March to speak at a 'women in politics' event. 'I've seen her on Meet The Press. I've seen her on Bill Maher's show ... she's great,' Rogers said in an interview. Fiornia 'doesn't just come on and bash the – you know, it's like, ""Here's all the problems"" – she actually is offering solutions.' 'Carly doesn't need to come in and give the razzle dazzle,' Rogers said. 'But she had some good one-liners about Hillary. And she's fair game.' Former Oklahoma GOP Chairman Gary Jones was equally impressed, telling The Washington Times that FIorin, 'whom most people had never heard of, got the best response.' 'She came across as a highly intelligent woman and a strong leader as the ex-chief executive of the biggest tech firm in the world. She did herself the most good.' The Freeom Summit featured a parade of conservative luminaries including Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, former vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, former Texas Gov.

"Furious MPs have attacked the City watchdog for delaying the release of a report into the collapse of Halifax Bank of Scotland until after the General Election. The findings will expose the disastrous blunders of former bank executives, regulators, as well as politicians. But they will now not be published until the summer at the earliest – nearly seven years since HBOS imploded after years of reckless lending, triggering a £20billion bail out from the taxpayer. Bailed out: Halifax needed a £20billion handout from the taxpayers to stay afloat after years of reckless lending and investments led to its near collapse during the banking crisis nearly seven years ago . Business Secretary Vince Cable described the delay as ‘totally unsatisfactory’. It comes after Sir John Chilcot said his report into the Iraq War will not be published until after May, winning a reprieve for figures in the Westminster establishment who are expected to be heavily criticised. The Chilcot findings, like the HBOS report, are understood to have been held up by those likely to be criticised by the inquiry and who have used lawyers to defend themselves. A section of the report will conclude whether the FCA should take action against individuals including disgraced former HBOS executives James Crosby, Andy Hornby and Lord Stevenson – all of whom were let off the hook by its predecessor the FSA. This part of the probe is being carried out by Andrew Green QC, who was hired last summer after MPs raised concerns about the independence of the regulator’s findings. Only one former executive, Peter Cummings, has been punished for his role in the downfall of HBOS, which was saved from collapse in September 2008, while Lloyds was bailed out weeks later. More than 46,000 staff have lost their jobs and Lloyds is still 25 per cent owned by taxpayers. Mr Cummings, who ran Bank of Scotland’s corporate division, was fined £500,000 in 2012 and received a lifetime ban from the City for presiding over a reckless lending spree which ultimately led to £26billion of losses. He has described it as ‘sinister and curious’ that he was ‘singled out’ while others escaped punishment. Let off the hook: But disgraced former HBOS executives Andy Hornby, left, and James Crosby, right, may still face action based on the recommendations of the latest report into their conduct ahead of the bank crash . The formal investigation into HBOS’s downfall was launched by the FSA in September 2012 after its enforcement probe into individuals at the lender was finally completed. It was meant to be published the following year. But the FCA – which replaced the FSA in April 2013 – moved the deadline to the end of last year. The latest delay is thought to stem partly from a process known as ‘Maxwellisation’ – named after the late newspaper tycoon Robert Maxwell – whereby those criticised can challenge what is written about them. The political sensitivity of the report is thought to be another reason why it will not emerge until after the election. It is expected to increase scrutiny on top figures in the Labour Party, including former Prime Minister and Chancellor Gordon Brown, who has been blamed for fostering the ‘light touch’ regulation that enabled banks to take huge gambles and behave with impunity. His key advisers when he was in the Treasury included Labour leader Ed Miliband and Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls. The legal wrangling has dragged on since the autumn of 2013, contributing to the spiralling cost of the inquiry, which is expected to top £1million, including £228,000 for legal advice for regulators criticised in the report. Last night Mr Cable said: ‘We are now more than six years on from the banking crisis. The people whose livelihoods have been wrecked by the irresponsible behaviour at HBOS and other banks deserve better than this.’ He added: ‘Holding up this report prevents us from making judgement on whether there has been wrongdoing and fraud and whether more former executives need to be punished.’ Tory MP Mark Garnier, who sits on the Treasury committee, said: ‘Maxwellisation seems to have become a standard excuse for delay and inactivity on so many levels. But the FCA has run out of excuses. It is vital we hear the truth as soon as possible.’ Cathy Jamieson, a Labour Treasury spokesman, said: ‘We want this report to be published as soon as possible. Nobody will take any lectures from the Tories when they repeatedly complained the last government was too tough on regulation.’ The delay will be compounded by the fact the Treasury committee has to see a final draft of the report. Insiders believe there is virtually no chance the report will be ready before the committee is dissolved on March 30, ahead of the May election. It may not reconvene until September. A spokesman for the FCA said: ‘We are committed to publishing the report as soon as possible but the legal process of Maxwellisation is currently under way and this can take some time.’ Facing criticism: James Crosby, left, and Andy Hornby . James Crosby, 58 . Dubbed Gordon Brown’s favourite banker, the Yorkshireman was credited with transforming HBOS into Britain’s biggest mortgage lender. He was knighted in 2006, quitting HBOS shortly afterwards with a £580,000-a-year pension. Mr Brown appointed him as deputy chairman of the FSA the following year. But a 2013 report into HBOS by the Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards described him as the ‘architect of the strategy that set the course for disaster’. He apologised, forfeited his knighthood and gave up a third of his pension. Andy Hornby, 47 . A former boss of Asda, Mr Hornby was chief . executive of HBOS when it was bailed out. He was accused by the commission of being ‘unable and unwilling to change course’, persisting with the reckless strategy established by his mentor Mr Crosby. He is now reported to receive more than £500,000 a year as boss of bookmaker Coral. Lord Stevenson, 69 . Earned £815,000 a year as chairman of HBOS from May 2001 until its downfall. He infuriated the commission with the claim that the collapse of HBOS was not his fault because he was ‘only there part time’. He has close links to New Labour and is a friend of former spin chief Lord Mandelson. He now runs a consultancy firm.","Financial Conduct Authority due to report on Halifax Bank of Scotland .

"Too bewildered and dehumanised to show any emotion, a dozen young faces peer out from a world beyond comprehension. Witnesses to unfathomable depths of human savagery, these are among the last occupants of history’s most infamous slaughterhouse. To stand in the Arctic chill of Auschwitz today, it seems extraordinary that anyone survived what unfolded here. Yet, astonishingly, most of the people in this photograph – taken exactly 70 years ago today – are still alive. What’s more, four of them – including a victim of the abominable human vivisectionist, Dr Josef Mengele – have returned to Auschwitz to mark the 70th anniversary of the day that Soviet troops liberated this place. Scroll down for video .

Eva Kor, left, and Miriam Ziegler, right point out how they looked the day prisoners in Auschwitz were freed near the end of the Second World War . Gabor Hirsch, left, and Paula Lebovics, right, both survived the camp and point at themselves on a picture taken the day the camp . January 27 is the date the world recognises as Holocaust Memorial Day. And around 100 survivors will gather here this afternoon, alongside world leaders, to remember all of the 6million Jewish victims of Nazi Germany’s trans-contintental programme of industrial genocide. Having beaten such insuperable odds to stay alive, it is a solemn sense of obligation to both past and future generations which has persuaded this small, heroic band to make this painful return journey for today’s anniversary. Ahead of the ceremonies, there have been some extraordinary and deeply moving scenes here, not least a reprise of that famous liberation photograph by Red Army photographer Alexander Vorontsov. After extensive detective work, the California-based Shoah Foundation, created by director Steven Spielberg, has tracked down the names of nearly all those in the photo to arrange this week’s reunion. Eva Kor was a few days short of her eleventh birthday when the Soviets suddenly arrived, along with Vorontsov and his ‘huge’ cameras. ‘We couldn’t believe that we really were free,’ Eva tells me. ‘So we kept walking out of the gate and then back in again. To do that without being shot – well, that was such a feeling of freedom that I still do it when I come back all these years later.’ Mordechai Ronen a holocaust survivor, centre, prays with fellow survivors upon arriving at the Auschwitz in a private visit to the camp today . Mr Ronen is comforted by fellow survivors after becoming emotional on returning to Auschwitz to mark the 70th anniversary of the camp's liberation .

At 80, she is a magnificent monument to the power of positive thought, proudly rolling up her sleeve to show me her prison number – A-7063 – tattooed on her arm. ‘People ask why I didn’t get it removed. Well, I paid a high price for this!’ Eva owes her survival to the fact she arrived from Hungarian-occupied Romania in 1944 with her twin sister, Miriam. Most Jewish children too small for slave labour would be taken straight to the gas chambers but the camp doctor, Mengele, had issued special orders for twins. They were needed for his gruesome medical research. The ten-year-old sisters were dragged from the family they would never see again and the experiments began almost immediately. ‘Monday, Wednesday and Friday, we had hours of measurement of every part of our bodies – so demeaning,’ says Eva matter of factly. ‘Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays, I had five injections in my right arm and, to this day, I have no idea what was in them.’ On one occasion, she was left so ill she heard Mengele tell medical staff she would be dead in a fortnight. ‘I was only ten but all I could think was “I am not going to let Mengele win”.’ She pulled through. There was another incentive. Once one twin was dead, the other was superfluous to requirements and would be executed. Eva had to stay alive to save Miriam. Weeks later, she risked hanging to steal two potatoes from the kitchens for her sister. ‘Miriam had dysentery and I thought the only way to keep her alive was to get her potatoes.’ Having returned home after the war, the sisters found rampant anti-semitism – ‘there were local rumours about Jewish vampires; people believed them’ – and emigrated to Israel before, finally, moving to the USA. Miriam died in 1993, but not before returning with Eva in 1985. ‘You know the first thing we did? We went and touched the barbed wire to feel what it was like not to be electrocuted.’ Eva still has one burning ambition. ‘There must be files somewhere saying what was in those injections which Mengele gave me. I have to find out.’ Mr Rosenthal walks alongside the perimeter fence at the concentration camp. He was one of the survivors paying homage to those who died during the Holocaust . Ukrainian survivor of Auschwitz Igor Malitski walks among the barracks at the former concentration camp past a picture, wearing his military medals .

A group of visitors to Auschwitz hold up an Israeli flag at the front gate of Auschwitz below the infamous 'Arbeit Macht Frei' sign at the former Nazi death camp . Shoes that were taken from the past prisoners have been piled up and put on display in the memorial museum at the former death camp site . Every survivor has some sort of heartbreaking unfinished business here. Beneath one of the 20th Century’s most despicable lies, Mordechai Ronen is consumed with grief. ‘I don’t ever want to come back here ever again!’ he shrieks. ‘Ever!’ The first time he saw the gates of Auschwitz, he was a bewildered 11-year-old from Romania. Now, at the age of 82, this founding father of the state of Israel is once again standing beneath the infamous archway to Auschwitz and its grotesque slogan: ‘Arbeit Macht Frei’ – ‘Work Brings Freedom’. Though it is the third time Mr Ronen has been back here since the war, every attempt to articulate his feelings is quashed by emotion. But he doesn’t need to say a thing. For 1.1million people, including most of Mr Ronen’s family, Auschwitz meant death. For many others, this dismal railway town in southern Poland was an horrific transit point on the way to being murdered somewhere else – in a labour camp or on a ‘death march’ to another prison-mortuary. Among the many millions who met their death here were Poles, gypsies and Soviet prisoners of war. Only 8,000 emaciated prisoners were still inside Auschwitz and its sub-camps when Stalin’s forces arrived in January 1945. The rest – like Mr Ronen – were already being herded across central Europe with just flimsy pyjamas and wooden clogs to protect them against the winter. Most were dead by the time Europe was liberated in May 1945. Another survivor on a painful quest here is Johnnie Pekats. Having arrived in 1943, his training in his father’s Carpathian barber’s shop landed him with an horrific assignment – shaving women prisoners destined for the gas chambers. He was 15. After the war, he emigrated to Canada and built a successful hair salon on New York’s Park Avenue. Until this week, he had never been back to Europe, let alone Auschwitz. Now he is here with his son, Todd. ‘I had to see where my mother and my baby sister were murdered,’ he says, walking slowly but purposefully through the slush to the site of the original Auschwitz gas chamber. ‘And I had to come with the next generation to show them what really happened.’ Today is the first time since Todd was a child that Johnnie has seen his son cry. He himself cannot stem the flow as he stands in the unlit chamber of horrors. ‘You can’t imagine the smell,’ he whispers again and again. ‘My heart is breaking…’ Johnnie keeps asking our guide to show him where his mother and sister might have breathed their last but, as with so much else here, no one can be sure. No explanation is needed as we walk through Block 4 where the hair of 50,000 prisoners – unearthed by the sackload after liberation – is piled the length of the building. Next door in Block 5, we see another large glass-fronted display case. As powerful as any words or photograph, it contains thousands of children’s shoes. Johnnie throws up his hands and walks out. Back at the gate, Johnnie is accosted by a young woman pushing a pram. ‘I am German and all I can say is how sorry I am,’ she says, and presses a tiny flower brooch into his hand. Afterwards, he tries to explain how much it means to him. ‘Such a small thing and such a very big thing…’ And he can find no more words.","Auschwitz survivors visited the Nazi concentration camp today ahead of the 70th anniversary of its liberation .

"The Supreme Court has ended a lawsuit against a disgraced Detroit judge who had an affair with a woman whose child support case he was presiding over, it was revealed on Monday. Former Wayne County judge Wade McCree had a sexual relationship with Geniene La’Shay Mott while he was overseeing the case between her and her ex-husband, Robert King, in 2012. During the affair, the married father-of-two - who once reportedly bragged there was 'no shame' in his 'game' about a shirtless photo he sent to a court deputy - had sex with Mott in his chambers. After the trysts were revealed, McCree was named in a lawsuit by King, who accused the judge of violating his civil rights after he ordered him to wear an electronic tether until he paid child support. Disgraced: The Supreme Court has ended a lawsuit against former Detroit judge Wade McCree (pictured) who had an affair with a woman whose child support case he was presiding over, it was revealed on Monday . Affair: McCree had a sexual relationship with Geniene La’Shay Mott (left) while he was overseeing the case between her and her ex-husband, Robert King, in 2012. Above, the married father-of-two reportedly bragged there was 'no shame' in his 'game' after sending this shirtless photo (right) to a court deputy in 2010 . In the lawsuit, King claimed McCree - who had worked at Wayne County Circuit Court since 2004 - had ruled in favor of his ex-wife because of his 'desires for sexual gratifications'. But on Monday, the Supreme Court's justices dismissed the  action, stating that judges are immune from lawsuits stemming from their judicial actions. They offered no further comment. The justices' decision followed similar rulings by lower courts, including the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals in Cincinnati, which also cited existing US law that judges are immune from such suits. However, in its ruling, the court noted that McCree's actions were 'often reprehensible.' In addition to engaging in sexual intercourse with Mott, McCree reportedly sent her explicit messages from the bench and gave her thousands of dollars, according to the Detroit Free Press. Last March, Michigan Supreme Court removed the judge from office and suspended him for six more years if he is reelected in November after his 20-week affair with Mott was exposed. Trysts: During their affair, McCree and Mott (seen together) had sex in the Wayne County judge's chambers . Lawsuit: After the trysts were revealed, McCree was named in a lawsuit by King (pictured), who accused the judge of violating his civil rights after he ordered him to wear an electronic tether until he paid child support . Although courts have long prevented judges being sued by litigants, King's attorney Joel Sklar, said in an earlier court case that McCree had used his judicial immunity 'as a shield for self interest.' 'There should be no immunity for what happened here,' said Sklar. However, Brian Einhorn, McCree's attorney, argued that his client's decision to tether King and order him to pay child support was the appropriate one, MyFoxDetroit.com reported. 'In our system, people are going to be unhappy when a judge renders a decision,' he said. 'And if a judge can be sued because the decision they made - in someone’s opinion - was right, wrong or unfair, then our system of justice doesn’t work.' Previous hearing: On Monday, the Supreme Court's justices dismissed King's action, stating that judges are immune from lawsuits stemming from their judicial actions. Above, Mott at an earlier court hearing . In 2012, McCree hit the headlines when a shirtless photo of him - which he is said to have sent to a married court deputy in 2010 - made its way into the public domain. When WJBK-TV showed him a printout of the photo, McCree - who quickly became known as 'the shirtless judge' - replied: 'Hot dog. Yep, that's me.' He later added: 'No shame to my game.' According to the newspaper, McCree's father, Wade Hampton McCree, Jr was the first black person appointed to the U.S. 6th Circuit Court of Appleals and the second black solicitor general in the U.S. McCree is believed to still be married to his wife, LaVerne. The couple have two teenage children.","Wayne County judge Wade McCree had affair with Geniene La'Shay Mott .

"Thousands of British jobs are at risk as technology giant IBM is reported to be preparing to cut a quarter of its workforce in the biggest corporate staff cull in history. More than 110,000 jobs could disappear worldwide in a major restructuring at the once-dominant computing goliath – nicknamed ‘Big Blue’. Some 20,000 are employed by the company in the UK across 24 offices, including sites in Portsmouth, London, Manchester and Edinburgh. Scroll down for video . Thousands of British jobs are at risk as technology giant IBM is reported to be preparing to cut a quarter of its workforce in the biggest corporate staff cull in history . There are fears that up to 5,000 roles could be at risk if the expected rate of redundancies is applied to Britain. The jobs will be cut as IBM undergoes a massive restructuring in a ‘desperate’ attempt to revamp its business, according to a report on the US Forbes website. But IBM poured cold water on the article, calling the reported scale of the job cuts ‘ridiculous’ and ‘baseless’. The website said the company was preparing to merge its three main arms – hardware, software and support – into a single operating business. It will break down the ‘Chinese walls’ between the divisions and reorganise staff into teams based on their jobs, such as sales or research. This is because of the growing demand from businesses to use companies such as IBM as a ‘one-stop shop’ for technology needs. It is expected to restructure its entire global workforce – some 430,000 people – under a programme known as Project Chrome. IBM has struggled to shift from its traditional strength of making computers to offering IT services and information storage. Last week, Ginni Rometty, chief executive since 2012 and who joined the company at 24 in 1981 as a systems engineer, reported quarterly profits below analysts' forecasts and an 11th straight quarter of falling revenues . The company set aside £400million for redundancies last week, which it described as ‘workforce rebalancing’, after three-month sales figures came in £444million lower than expected. If it axes one in four staff, as reported, it will be the largest corporate layoff in history. The previous largest redundancy programme was also from IBM, when it cut 60,000 staff in 1993. Robert Cringley, from Forbes, said: ‘To fix its business problems and speed up its “transformation,” next week about 26 per cent of IBM’s employees will be getting phone calls from their managers. ‘Project Chrome will hit many of the worldwide services operations. The USA will be hit hard, but so will other locations.’ An IBM spokesman said: ‘IBM does not comment on rumours, even ridiculous or baseless ones. ‘IBM has already announced the company has just taken a $600million [£400million] charge for workforce rebalancing. This equates to several thousand people, a mere fraction of what’s been reported.’ BP will freeze salaries across the company this year as a way of cutting costs in the face of the falling oil price. All of the company’s 15,000 UK staff will see their basic pay frozen at 2014 levels. The firm said it would look at increasing them again in 2016. The computer company was founded in 1911 and was a merger of four earlier companies. When it started out, it focused on technological advances such as the computing scale (a weighing scale which gave the prices of the different items it weighed) and the time clock (which allowed workers to record the times they started and finished work each day). IBM played a key role in Franklin D Roosevelt's Social Security Act of 1935, which included the issuing of social security numbers to 26 million American workers. From the 1950s to the 1980s, it produced the first hard and floppy disks, the supermarket checkout and an early ATM. In 1981, it released its own personal computer, the IBM PC. In 1990, the company was the second most profitable enterprise in the world and was believed to be set to benefit from the continued growth of the IT industry. But the following year the company's earnings dropped as it outsourced its software and hardware and between 1991 and 1993 the company posted a $16billion loss. Hundreds of thousands of employees lost their jobs. However, a new CEO Louis V Gerstner Jr, turned the fortunes of the company around during the 1990s, coinciding with the rise of the internet. It focused on business software and specialist microchip production. By 1994 the company was showing a $3 billion profit once more. Gerstner retired in 2002, with the company once again one of the top computing firms in the world. However, in recent years IBM has struggled to make the move from manufacturing computers and microchips to the world of cloud computing. Last week it reported quarterly profits below analysts' forecasts and an 11th straight quarter of falling revenues.","Thousands of British jobs at risk as IBM prepares to cut its workforce .

"Demand for properties which cost £1million a year to rent is soaring because of growing concerns about mansion tax and stamp duty, according to a new report. The £1million-plus rental market has boomed since 2010, when two large penthouses were let out in Mayfair, London. Since then, the market has grown across the capital to include properties in Knightsbridge, Chelsea, South Kensington, Notting Hill, Regent's Park, St John's Wood and Holland Park. The average weekly rent in London's ultra-prime lettings market is now £3,500 per week or £182,000 per year. The most expensive property on the London rental market - and one of the most expensive rental in London ever - is No.11 at Cornwall Terrace . This six-bedroom, six-reception, 8,833sq ft mansion on Cornwall Terrace, known as Billionaire's Row, is up for rent for £20,000 per week . The exterior of the £1million-a-year rental  at Cornwall Terrace, where you get a gym and spa - and the Qatari royal family as neighbours . It is a 23 per cent rise on five years ago and is more than the average price paid last month for a home in England and Wales. Across Central London, the average rent paid in the third quarter of 2014 was 6.5 per cent higher than 12 months earlier - the highest rate of growth for more than three years. The luxury houses tend to be let by Africans, Middle East tenants and Russians, who have made their wealth from oil, gas, investments or commodity trading. Apartments and penthouses tend to be let by UK, North American, Continental European and Asian households. It is now thought the number of people looking to rent high-end properties rather than buy could increase even further. An undersupply of luxury properties and concerns about the 2015 election, the proposed mansion tax and the recent Stamp Duty changes are driving the wealthy into the rental market, according to a new report by Beauchamp Estates and Dataloft, the market intelligence group. Key 'must have' features for super-prime London rentals (No.11 at Cornwall Terrace, pictured above)  include wine caves, private gymnasiums with swimming pools, lifts and landscaped gardens .

Also on the market with estate agents Rokstone is 78 South Audley Street - on for £600,000 a year . Gary Hersham, managing director of Beauchamp, is currently looking to let a six-bedroom mansion next door to the Qatari Royal Family in Cornwall Terrace - which overlooks Regent's Park and is known as the most expensive terrace in the world. The 8,883 sq. ft. ambassadorial-style home is on the rental market for £960,000 per year with any prospective tenant having to stump up a £260,000 deposit. It also features a gym, spa, bathrooms with Kashmir gold detailing and bespoke carpets with silk borders. Mr Hersham also has a five-bedroom property in Knightsbridge on the rental market for £768,000 per year. It boasts a swimming pool and jacuzzi and requires an £85,000 deposit. He said: 'Concerns over a change of government, the mansion tax debate and now Stamp Duty changes have led high-net-worth-individuals to decide to rent for the next 12 months and delay purchase plans. 'This might cost a client up to £1 million, but this is less than a £25 to £100 million outlay for an ultra-prime property. 'Whilst the ultra-prime lettings market has boomed during 2014 the equivalent sales sector has been affected by the uncertainty in the market caused by the pending general election and the issues over the Mansion Tax.'

Another London agency, Rokstone Properties, is looking to rent out a Mayfair mansion for £576,000 per year. The five-storey townhouse on Audley Street in Westminster boasts eight bedrooms, five bathrooms, four living rooms and a gym, sauna and plunge pool. Becky Fatemi, managing director of property agent Rokstone said: 'Prime Central London's ultra prime lettings market, properties for rent for over £20,000 per month or more, has only truly emerged over the last 12 months, and has really taken off over the last four months. 'Traditionally clients owning luxury residences in projects such as One Hyde Park, The Knightsbridge, 10 Soho Square and Trevor Square would not have chosen or needed to rent, preferring to leave their properties empty, enabling them to effectively remain brand new.' 'The tenants are celebrities, overseas Royals, corporate rents and people looking to buy but deciding to wait until after the election. 'Currently lettings demand is exceeding lettings supply, and the number of sales instructions on the market is also down. This is resulting in lettings values going up, and also sales values going up as there are simply not enough properties in either sector available to meet demand at present.' An undersupply of luxury properties and concerns about the 2015 election, the proposed mansion tax and the recent Stamp Duty changes are driving the wealthy into the rental market, according to a new report by Beauchamp Estates and Dataloft.

Estate agent Russell Simpson also has The Court House available in Chelsea for a whopping £600,000 per year. Lottie Henniker-Major, head of lettings at Russell Simpson, said there is a lull of available properties which is pushing prices up. She said: 'There is a distinct shortage of stock in the upper end of the market with no new properties having come on to the market in the £7000 pw+ price bracket in 2015 so far. 'I can only predict that this will lead to a further increase in rental prices moving forward.' Lottie Henniker-Major, head of lettings at Russell Simpson, said there is currently a lull of available properties which is pushing prices up . Super-prime buyers are moving into the rental market due to a recent hike in stamp duty and fears about a new mansion tax at the next election.

"Five time gold medalist Ian Thorpe has pulled the plug on his Aboriginal education charity following  funding cuts from the Federal government. The decision to terminate the Fountain for Youth charity was revealed in a letter from Thorpe and the company chief executive, Jeff McMullen. He claims budget cuts took a 'devastating' toll, despite the literacy program of the company being hailed as a success story, reports The West Australian. Scroll down for video . Cathy Freeman and Ian Thorpe pose at the Ian Thorpe Foundation event on November 2010. Thorpe claims the indigenous budget cuts introduced by the Abbott government in 2014 had a devastating effect on his charity the Fountain for Youth, which was liquidated last week . Thorpe said he is planning to continue mentoring high-school students and improving education in indigenous towns . Australian Securities and Investments Commission records show the company was liquidated last week. Thorpe founded the charity in 2000 to improve indigenous literacy and health in remote areas. In an interview with Michael Parkinson last year, he said the company was 'starting to see results'. In 2012, Thorpe was granted the the prestigious Human Rights Medal for his work with the Fountain for Youth charity. The Gillard Government had previously listed the charity on their website as an outstanding success.

"Millions of genetically modified mosquitoes could be released in the Florida Keys if British researchers win approval to use the bugs against two extremely painful viral diseases. Never before have insects with modified DNA come so close to being set loose in a residential U.S. neighborhood. 'This is essentially using a mosquito as a drug to cure disease,' said Michael Doyle, executive director of the Florida Keys Mosquito Control District, which is waiting to hear if the Food and Drug Administration will allow the experiment. This undated photo made available by Oxitec shows a genetically modified Aedes aegypti mosquito in their U.K. lab. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is considering releasing the non-biting male Aedes aegypti mosquitoes modified by Oxitec to pass along a birth defect to their progeny, thus killing off the next generation of the mosquitoes that can carry dengue and chikungunya. The FDA is planning to release the mosquitos in a neighborhood of 444 homes near Key West, Fla. (AP Photo/Oxitec, Derric Nimmo) Oxitec's lab workers manually remove modified females, aiming to release only males, which feed on nectar and don't bite for blood like females do. The modified males then mate with wild females whose offspring die, reducing the population. Dengue and chikungunya are growing threats in the U.S., but some people are more frightened at the thought of being bitten by a genetically modified organism. More than 130,000 signed a Change.org petition against the experiment. Even potential boosters say those responsible must do more to show that benefits outweigh the risks. 'I think the science is fine, they definitely can kill mosquitoes, but the GMO issue still sticks as something of a thorny issue for the general public,' said Phil Lounibos, who studies mosquito control at the Florida Medical Entomology Laboratory. 'It's not even so much about the science — you can't go ahead with something like this if public opinion is negative.' Mosquito controllers say they're running out of options that can kill Aedes aegypti, a tiger-striped invader whose biting females spread these viruses. Climate change and globalization are spreading tropical diseases farther from the equator, and Key West, the southernmost city in the continental U.S., is particularly vulnerable. 'An arriving person would be infectious for several days, and could infect many of the local mosquitoes,' Doyle said. 'Within a few weeks you'd likely end up with several infected mosquitoes for each infected visitor.' Insecticides are sprayed year-round from helicopters and door-to-door in charming and crowded neighborhoods throughout the Keys. But because Aedes aegypti don't travel much and are repeatedly doused with the same chemicals, they have evolved to resist four of the six insecticides used to kill them. Enter Oxitec, a British biotech firm launched by Oxford University researchers. They patented a method of breeding Aedes aegypti with fragments of proteins from the herpes simplex virus and E. coli bacteria as well as genes from coral and cabbage. This synthetic DNA has been used in thousands of experiments without harming lab animals, but it is fatal to the bugs, killing mosquito larvae before they can fly or bite. Oxitec's lab workers manually remove modified females, aiming to release only males, which feed on nectar and don't bite for blood like females do. Jason Garcia, a field inspector with the Florida Keys Mosquito Control District, tests a sprayer that could be used in the future to spray pesticides to control mosquitos in Key West, Fla. There are no vaccines or cures for dengue, known as 'break-bone fever,' or chikungunya, which causes painful contortions. U.S. cases remain rare for now, but dengue sickens 50 million people annually worldwide and kills 2.5 percent of the half-million who get severe cases, according to the World Health Organization. Chikungunya has already overwhelmed hospitals and harmed economies across the Caribbean after infecting a million people in the region last year. The modified males then mate with wild females whose offspring die, reducing the population. Oxitec has built a breeding lab in Marathon and hopes to release its mosquitoes this spring in Key Haven, a neighborhood of 444 homes closely clustered on a relatively isolated peninsula at the north end of Key West. FDA spokeswoman Theresa Eisenman said no field tests will be allowed until the agency has 'thoroughly reviewed all the necessary information.' Company spokeswoman Chris Creese said the test will be similar in size to Oxitec's 2012 experiment in the Cayman Islands, where 3.3 million modified mosquitoes were released over six months, suppressing 96 percent of the targeted bugs. Oxitec says a later test in Brazil also was successful, and both countries now want larger-scale projects. But critics accused Oxitec of failing to obtain informed consent in the Caymans, saying residents weren't told they could be bitten by a few stray females overlooked in the lab. Brittany Mariscal, an entomological technician with the Florida Keys Mosquito Control District, sorts and counts dead captured mosquitoes under a microscope in Key West, Fla. Instead, Oxitec said only non-biting males would be released, and that even if humans were somehow bitten, no genetically modified DNA would enter their bloodstream. Neither claim is entirely true, outside observers say. 'What Oxitec is trying to spin is that it's highly improbable that there will be negative consequences of this foreign DNA entering someone that's bitten by an Oxitec mosquito,' said Lounibos. 'I'm on their side, in that consequences are highly unlikely. But to say that there's no genetically modified DNA that might get into a human, that's kind of a gray matter.' Asked about these points, Creese says Oxitec has now released 70 million of its mosquitoes in several countries and received no reports of human impacts caused by bites or from the synthetic DNA, despite regulatory oversight that encourages people to report any problems. 'We are confident of the safety of our mosquito, as there's no mechanism for any adverse effect on human health. The proteins are non-toxic and non-allergenic,' she said. Oxitec should still do more to show that the synthetic DNA causes no harm when transferred into humans by its mosquitoes, said Guy Reeves, a molecular geneticist at Germany's Max Planck Institute. To build trust in any cutting-edge science, a range of independent experts — not just the company that stands to gain or the regulatory agency involved — should have enough access to data published in peer-reviewed journals to be able to explain the specific benefits and risks, he said. 'Failing to do this almost inevitably means a potential for controversy to be sustained and amplified,' said Reeves, adding that mosquito-borne diseases need more solutions. 'We should not be closing down productive avenues, and genetically modified mosquitoes might be one of them.' An Aedes aegypti mosquito feeds on the arm of Emilio Posada, the Upper Keys supervisor for the Florida Keys Mosquito Control District, in Key Largo, Fla. With the FDA watching, Doyle and Oxitec's product development manager, Derric Nimmo, checked their frustration at public meetings in November and December, repeatedly fielding the same questions from the same critics. Their selling points: . This experiment is self-limiting, using insects engineered to kill their progeny, not make them stronger. It is contained, since Oxitec's mosquitoes won't breed with other species. Killing off Aedes aegypti can protect human health while eliminating an invasive species. And most Key Haven residents responded positively to a district survey about the planned field test. Using GMOs also could save money: The district spends 10 percent of its budget on Aedes aegypti, which represents less than 1 percent of the 45 mosquito species buzzing around the Keys. Key Haven resident Marilyn Smith still wasn't persuaded. The Keys haven't experienced a dengue outbreak in years, and no chikungunya cases have been reported here, she said. 'If I knew that this was a real risk and lives could be saved, that would make sense,' Smith said. 'But there are no problems. Why are we trying to fix it? Why are we being used as the experiment, the guinea pigs, just to see what happens?' If the FDA decides against the test, or the modified mosquitoes fail to work as promised, Doyle will still need to kill the bugs. 'I'm convinced the only way to fight this is using the mosquitoes to fight each other,' he said.

"It was an operation that saved her life. But for Victoria Eames, having a hysterectomy has proved life-changing. The 32-year-old's world crashed down around her when doctors revealed she was suffering cervical cancer, following a routine smear test. The dancer was told her womb would have to be removed to prevent the cancer from spreading. Victoria Eames, 32 (left) says her world came crashing down when a routine smear test revealed she had cervical cancer and had a hysterectomy to remove her womb. She was devastated she would never be a mother, when her friend Jenah Colledge (right) stepped in and said she would be her surrogate . Miss Eames and her partner had always planned on having children, so it was a huge blow to learn the hysterectomy operation she needed to halt the spread of cancer would leave her infertile. Ms Eames, a dancer, has now been declared cancer-free. She is pictured during a shoot before the was diagnosed . It left Miss Eames and her partner of two years, illustrator James Lobley, 24, devastated. They had always planned on having children, yet the operation left Ms Eames infertile. But in the couple's moment of despair, Ms Eames's best friend Jenah Colledge stepped in, offering to act as a surrogate, giving her friend the gift of motherhood. Ms Eames, who has since been given the all-clear from cancer, said: 'I've always wanted the traditional things, to get married, get pregnant, have children. 'Lots of people want a fancy house, holidays, cars, but I just wanted the simple things - I love my family, I love James, and wanted a family of my own. 'Hearing that I would never be pregnant just shattered my world. 'There were times after I'd been diagnosed that I'd wake up and think it was all a dream - but then I'd get the crushing realisation that it was real, this was my life now. 'It's such a feeling of loss but then I feel I've gained something in some way. Cervical cancer is an uncommon type of cancer that develops in a woman's cervix. The cervix is the entrance to the womb from the vagina. Cervical cancer often has no symptoms in its early stages. The most common symptom is unusual vaginal bleeding, which can occur after sex, in-between periods or after the menopause. Over the course of many years, the cells lining the surface of the cervix undergo a series of changes. In rare cases, these precancerous cells can become cancerous. However, cell changes in the cervix can be detected at a very early stage and treatment can reduce the risk of cervical cancer developing. In most cases, the treatment will be: . Early cervical cancer – surgery to remove some or all of the womb, radiotherapy, or a combination of the two . Advanced cervical cancer – radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy, although surgery is also sometimes used . Source: NHS Choices . 'It sounds weird to say but for me this has been a positive experience. 'Now I see what I could have lost, it's like everything is better - it's almost like my life is in focus, colours are brighter, sharper, I know how lucky I am to be alive. 'As soon as Jenah found out what had happened, she told me: ""Let me do this for you. Let's crack on"". 'She'll never know how much what she's doing means to me - I'll never be able to thank her enough for making my life complete.' Ms Eames, from Castleford, in West Yorkshire, runs entertainment company Pastiche Europe. She added: 'My doctor told me the most successful chance of me surviving was to have a hysterectomy. 'I was just devastated. One hundred per cent devastated. I sobbed. 'I remember telling James that I was sorry. I felt like I'd let him down. 'We'd already spoken about pregnancy in the past. I knew he'd make a great dad but I felt like all of our plans were ruined. 'All of the things I'd hoped for wouldn't ever happen. 'When I'd been diagnosed, Jenah had offered to be a surrogate, but at the time, I told her it wouldn't come to that. 'But I rang her as soon as we got out of the meeting that day. 'She said: ""Right, come on then, let's crack on. I'd do anything for you, just let me know what you need"".' On December 3, Ms Eames underwent a hysterectomy, with surgeons removing everything but her ovaries. She was given the all-clear by doctors on December 18, and will have check-ups every three months. Doctors have told Ms Eames to wait a year until she and Ms Colledge start the surrogacy process, to ensure the cancer does not return. She is pictured before being diagnosed with cancer . Ms Eames says she still has 'bad days' where she feels depressed she will never experience things like the pain of childbirth and morning sickness. She is pictured as a child . She said: 'Of course I have bad days. Realising I will never be pregnant is hard. 'I notice pregnant women more now, in films, on the street. 'I know I'll have an amazing thing with Jen, but I still feel a little bit sad that I won't get to know how it feels to carry a child. 'Even the things people complain about, I'll never experience - the pain of childbirth, the morning sickness. Little things like that. 'The best thing about Jen offering is that I know I can trust her 100 per cent,' Ms Eames says of her friend, who she has known for nine years . 'But I look at things like 'I'm here'.' Doctors have told Ms Eames to wait a year until she and Ms Colledge start the surrogacy process, to ensure the cancer does not return. 'The best thing about Jen offering is that I know I can trust her 100 per cent,' Ms Eames said. 'And since she's offered, I've never doubted her for a minute. 'I wouldn't do surrogacy with a stranger, because they can decide right up until you sign the papers that they can't do it. 'They're carrying something that is so important to you, so I'm glad a friend can do that for me. 'And she'd kill me if I did it with anyone else. 'She's just an incredible friend and she'll never know how much it means to me.' Ms Eames has known her best friend for nine years, since the two worked as entertainers together for a company in Leeds. University student  Ms Colledge, 30, who has a 12-year-old daughter called Grace and lives in Sunderland, said: 'As soon as I knew how serious it was I came up with the idea and when it did progress I stuck to my decision because it's the right thing to do. 'Nine months out of my time can make a difference to her whole life.'

"A fraudster made £22,000 selling fake Poppy Appeal and Help for Heroes pins, conning people into thinking they were making charity donations while he pocketed the cash. Jay Meech also sourced and sold counterfeit badges of Premier League clubs including Manchester United, Arsenal, Chelsea and Southampton. The 28-year-old ripped off the charities and clubs to the tune of around £22,000, Portsmouth Crown Court heard. 'Despicable': Fraudster Jay Meech made £22,000 selling fake Poppy Appeal, Help for Heroes and football club pins . Meech, 28, was caught after the Premier League became suspicious of the fake pins, showing Arsenal, Chelsea, Manchester United and Southampton logos . Jonathan Underhill, prosecuting, said Meech sold the fake pins, made in China and shipped to the UK, through a website he ran for six years. The fraudster was caught when the Premier League grew suspicious that the pins were fake. Officers from Trading Standards ordered Southampton and Chelsea badges and confirmed the league's suspicions. Meech sent the investigators his business card with the orders, giving away his address and allowing them to storm his home in Gosport, Hampshire, shortly before Remembrance Sunday in 2013. During the search, they discovered 5,849 Poppy Appeal badges, 706 Help for Heroes badges and over 1,000 football club pins, the court heard. Of the £22,000 made through the sales of the badges, around two-thirds of this went to Meech. Around £3,000 of the money accounted for was from sales of the charity pins. Meech made £3,000 from the charity badges, as well as thousands more from the football club pins . Merok admitted 10 counts of unauthorised use of trademarks and was handed an eight-month prison sentence, suspended for two years . Disgraceful: The forces charities slammed Meech's crimes as 'despicable' after his sentencing . Meech admitted 10 counts of unauthorised use of a trademark and was handed an eight-month prison sentence, suspended for two years, and told to pay £1,650 in costs. Judge Roger Hetherington said: 'You started off honestly trading legitimate badges, but at some point greed got the better of you because of the profit you could get by sourcing the badges from China which showed some considerable planning. 'This was a fraudulent activity which made you a sizeable sum of money.' In mitigation, the court heard Meech had made a donation of £600 to each charity. Councillor Roy Perry, leader of Hampshire County Council, said: 'It's despicable that anyone could think of profiting to the detriment of two such worthy charities, particularly when we have been remembering the sacrifices of our armed forces now and 100 years ago with the commemorations of the start of the First World War. 'These kinds of criminal activities severely damage the local economy and legitimate traders by gaining a competitive advantage at their expense, and taking trade away from genuine hard-working businesses, and in this case charities.'

France's defence ministry said that one Frenchman was killed and five seriously injured. Based on initial reports, there were no U.S. personnel killed but an unknown number were treated for minor injuries, said Air Force Lt. Col. Vanessa Hillman, a Pentagon spokeswoman. Two Greek pilots on board the doomed jet were among the dead. The Greek jet had taken off on a training exercise before losing power and crashing into hangers where other planes were being kept, the defence ministry said in a statement. Military sources said the accident happened after the plane had failed to gather sufficient power before taking off, according to The Local, which cited a report in El Pais. It smashed into the area of the base where the other planes involved in the Nato exercise were parked.

"A model who was  called 'ugly' by classmates has beaten the bullies by becoming a beauty queen. Rebekah Hemsley, 23, was constantly picked on until the torment became so severe she had to be home schooled. But now the casino hostess from Nottingham, who now models part-time for promotional photographers, is intent on becoming winning the Miss England title. Rebekah's confidence was destroyed by daily taunts at school but modelling helps boost her self-esteem . Rebekah Hemsley was so badly bullied about her looks that she had to be home schooled. Now she's a model . 'Everyone through my life pushed me down and said I was ugly - they convinced me my nose was the worst in the school.' As well as verbally abusing her, Rebekah faced physical attacks. One student, knowing that she had hayfever, shoved grass down her jumper to make her cry. When she got to secondary school, the bullying only got worse and she was regularly called 'anorexic' and picked on because of the shape of her nose. After switching school failed to solve the problem, her mother resorted to arranging for a home tutor to get Rebekah through her GCSEs as she was scared of entering the classroom. But now she has proven her cruel classmates wrong by becoming a successful model, signed to two agencies, who is now competing for the chance to be Miss England. Yet Rebekah's bid to fight back almost faltered when she was diagnosed with endometriosis a year ago. Rebekah is now signed to two agencies and does part-time modelling, appearing in promotional photography . As a child Rebekah was constantly teased about her nose and was called anorexic by her peers . Despite the chronic pain caused by the condition, which affects the lining of the womb, Rebekah has vowed not to give up her dream of pageanting. And now she's vying for the Miss England title  after being picked to enter from a simple selfie. Rebekah sent this selfie to apply for Miss England and was selected to compete the next day . After seeing a call for entrants to the competition, Rebekah admitted an image of herself and thought nothing of it. But a day later she was invited to an audition and she is now in a heat to make it through to the Miss England semi-finals where she will compete against women from all over the country for the main title. Rebekah is appealing for votes on Facebook where the public can help send her through to the next round. Rebekah says that the competition is of particular importance to her as she wants to inspire others to achieve their dreams. 'I wanted to do Miss England because it just goes to show that anyone can make it if you put your mind to it. 'Thanks to the help of a counsellor and my very supportive boyfriend, family and friends, I have grown so much and I realised that I could be an example to people about how you can turn your life around. 'I was bullied so badly I sometimes cry just thinking about how cruel children can be. 'I was terrified of going to school because my confidence had been so battered. 'And now I couldn't be more different - everyone has noticed that I'm different - I've gone from being 100 per cent introvert to being loud and proud.' Rebekah says she now realises that she never had anything to worry about when it came to her appearance. 'And I know now that the bullies were just jealous. They were calling me ugly and mocking me about my nose just as modelling agencies were signing me up to be on their books. Rebekah was diagnosed with endometriosis but won't let it affect her chances of winning Miss England . Miss England hopeful Rebekah wants to show that no matter what the bullies say, everyone is beautiful . 'Being a model has helped me grow in confidence. Going to castings has given me a thick skin and encouraged me loads - people actually want to take my photo!' Overcoming obstacles has made Rebekah even more determined to win the competition. 'Even though I've been diagnosed with a horrible condition and my endometriosis causes me pain every day, I don't see why that should stop me from achieving my goals,' she said. 'I'm in the running to represent the country and I'd love to be able to show that no matter what the bullies say, everyone is beautiful.'

"An NHS boss has lost the fight for half of the £500,000 home she spent two years doing up to share with her boyfriend, only for him to dump her four months later. Lorna Gibson, 37, claimed that Dr William Knottenbelt recruited her and her family to renovate his dilapidated three-bedroom home - only to end their relationship months after he moved in. Together with her retired father Frank and her uncle she had given up her weekends to help transform the 'scruffy' house in South Harrow, Central London county court heard. Two months after the couple split, solicitors for Miss Gibson, her father, and her uncle wrote to Dr Knottenbelt demanding £67,500 to cover the two men's labour costs. Lorna Gibson, 37, (left) has lost the fight for half of the £500,000 home she spent two years doing up to share with her boyfriend Dr William Knottenbelt (right), only for him to dump her four months later . Miss Gibson, an operations manager at Chelsea and Westminster NHS Foundation Trust, had expected to move in and tie the knot with the lecturer, but was heartbroken when he ended the relationship on 'grounds of incompatibility'. Judge Vivian Chapman QC, dismissing her claim against Dr Knottenbelt said Miss Gibson was clearly 'deeply in love with him' and was 'devastated'. 'She was convinced that she and William were going to get married, live together in the property and have a family'. 'But I am not satisfied that William ever said or did anything which definitely committed him to any of these things'. The judge said that when the lecturer bought Miss Gibson a ring for Christmas in 2008 she 'asked him whether she might be receiving a ring from the engagement ring selection next year'. He replied 'maybe', but the judge ruled that this was 'non-committal'. The pair met in 2005 and soon began a 'close relationship', but they never lived together. Dr Knottenbelt, 42, a computer science lecturer at Imperial College, completed the purchase of his new home in late December 2006, moving in during the autumn of 2008. Judge Chapman said the 'heart of the claim' rested on an alleged oral agreement at a dinner party in December 2006 at the home of Miss Gibson's parents in Hampton Hill. Together with her retired father Frank and her uncle, the NHS boss had given up her weekends to help transform the 'scruffy' house in South Harrow, central London . She and her family claimed it was understood that Dr Knottenbelt would buy the couple's new home, but she would have a half-share in return for contributing to extensive renovations and the couple's living expenses. Her father, Frank Gibson, a retired golfing enthusiast and DIY expert, agreed to take on the bulk of the renovation work and enlisted the help of two relatives, her lawyers claimed. Miss Gibson's sister Jane agreed with this account and even claimed that the family cat's dislike of Dr William Knottenbelt showed he was of bad character. 'She even placed significance on a perceived dislike of William by the Gibson family cat as showing that the cat was a perceptive judge of William's bad character,' sad the judge. Miss Gibson said she gave up her weekends to help her father as he worked to transform the house, working as a 'builder's mate and clearing up and going to the shop for materials'. 'She now believes that the whole episode was a deceitful scheme by William to get his house renovated by her family without payment,' said Judge Chapman. Ruling in Dr Knottenbelt's favour, the judge said: 'I find that there was no agreement on 13 December 2006, or at any other time, that Lorna would receive a half share in the property'. 'I entirely reject the suggestion of Lorna and her family that the whole episode was a deceitful scheme by William to get the property renovated by her family free of charge'. The judge said much work had been done by outside contractors, although a 'great deal' was also accomplished by the couple's relatives - particularly Frank Gibson. Dr Knottenbelt accepted Mr Gibson's 'tremendous' contribution to the two-year-long makeover, pointing out that he had offered to pay him £5,000 for his efforts. The lecturer accepted that 'DIY was not my forte', but insisted that he had 'project-managed' the work, and more than did his bit. Mr Gibson said that 'although William and his family helped with the renovation they were inexpert, and that he had to spend time teaching them and remedying their defective work'. The judge accepted that he had 'undoubtedly' worked hard on the project, but ruled the value of his contribution around £12,000 - far less than the £70,000 claimed. After the case Dr Knottenbelt's barrister, Elissa Da Costa-Waldman, said her client was 'happy' at the outcome and was awarded his costs of the five-day hearing.","Lorna Gibson sued her ex-boyfriend for a half-share of his £500,000 home .

"Dashcam footage shows the dramatic moment police officers finally stopped a bank robber on a Michigan highway after the wanted man stabbed himself behind the wheel. The video, which was shared with the Kalamazoo Gazette, reveals Michigan State Police trailing Brian Standiford, 49, at low speeds before one of their trucks knocks the side of his car to force him off I-94. After one failed attempt that sent Standiford's car spinning, the truck knocks him again, forcing him into a snow bank. As police approach, he raises his hands out of the window. Before the scene captured on video on January 13, Standiford had allegedly robbed an Old National Bank in Portage but was forced to run after a dye pack exploded. Taking chase: Michigan State Police can be seen trailing a white car driven by robbery suspect Brian Standiford after he allegedly held up a bank in Portage, Michigan on January 13 . Knock: After Standiford failed to stop after driving over spike strips so the trooper knocked his car, sending him into a snowbank. Officers had feared he would crash in a more populated area . Police spotted him driving his getaway car and following him onto I-94, where they set up spike strips near Exit 60 to Paw Paw. But after he hit the strips, which deflated his wheels, he continued his slow-moving getaway. Also after hitting the strips, he pulled out a knife and attempted to stab himself in the chest, police said. Worried that Standiford would continue driving and crash into a busier area, troopers decided to knock his car in an effort to stop him. When they did, they discovered the knife inside the car. As well as the bank robbery before the pursuit on January 13, Standiford was wanted in connection with a January 5 armed robbery at a Chemical Bank branch in Oshtemo Township, Mlive reported. Surrendered: He can be seen putting his hands up outside the car after being stopped by troopers . Stopped: Officers then arrested him and found he had tried to stab himself inside the moving car . Arrest: He was taken into custody and charged in connection with two bank robberies . He has now been charged with two counts of bank robbery and one count of fleeing and eluding police. He is also suspected in a January 12 armed robbery at a Consumers Credit Union branch in South Haven, though no charges have been brought in that incident. But it's far from his first brush with the law. According to the Indiana State Prison Offender database, Standiford spent time in prison for a string of robberies in 1992, Mlive reported. Then in 1993, he pleaded guilty to robbing two banks and several stores to feed his drug habit, the Times of Northwest Indiana reported. In custody: The 49-year-old has a long history of bank robberies and previously served time in Indiana . During that time, he earned the nickname 'The Big Bandit' in the 1990s for his size and for his regular holdups. Then in March 1997, he was arrested while on drugs following three bank robberies in northwest Indiana. He pleaded guilty and was sent to prison for stealing a total of $15,848 over three days. He is due in Kalamazoo County District Court on Wednesday for hearings for the January 5 and January 13 robberies.","Brian Standiford, 49, 'fled after a dye pack exploded on him during a bank robbery in Portage, Michigan on January 13'

"Rumours of a 12-inch MacBook Air began circulating earlier this month, and now leaked photos have added weight to this speculation. The shots were published on Chinese Apple fan site iFanr and claim to show the rear casing and logo of a mid-sized Apple notebook. Apple’s current Air and Pro notebooks are available with 11-inch, 13-inch and 15-inch displays. The leaked photos (pictured) were published on Chinese Apple fan site iFanr and they claim to show the rear casing and logo on a 12-inch MacBook Air. This image shows how the mid-sized display would compare to Apple's current 13-inch MacBook Air Notebook . The reports of a mid-sized MacBook Air originated at the start of January from 9to5Mac. The fan site said Apple is preparing to launch a ‘radically new design’, in 2015 that ditches USB ports and SD cards to make it super thin, with a higher-resolution screen. Rumours  claim Apple is working on a 12.2-inch iPad, dubbed iPad Pro or iPad Air Plus. Earlier this month, an image was leaked that appeared to be a mould for the device. The photo was reportedly taken at Apple manufacturer Foxconn's factory in China and is said to measure approximately 12 inches high by 8.7 inches wide. It followed a leaked sketch that claimed to show one corner of the so-called megapad. Other rumours suggest the tablet could have a 12.9-inch screen. Alternatively, the rumours of a larger iPad could be being confused with the rumours of a mid-sized MacBook Air. These reports came from sources within Apple who had been given prototypes to use. Now, the leaked photos have provided more evidence of this streamlined design. They show the rear of the notebook and display, and reveal how it compares with existing Apple products including the iPad and the 13-inch MacBook Air. The source of the images has not been revealed, so they can’t be verified. In the UK, an 11-inch MacBook Air costs from £749, a 13-inch is £849 and prices for a 13-inch MacBook Pro start at £899. There is also a 13-inch, and 15-inch MacBook Pro with Retina Display with prices starting from £999 and £1,599 respectively. In the US, prices range from $899 for the smaller MacBook Air up to $1,799 for the high-end MacBook Pro with Retina display. Apple may be looking to introduce a new price point for its notebooks range by launching a 12-inch model, or it could be planning to remove the 11-inch version from the range completely. Rumours also claim Apple is working on a 12.2-inch iPad, dubbed iPad Pro or iPad Air Plus. Earlier this month, an image was leaked that appeared to be a mould for the device. Apple’s current Air notebooks are available with 11-inch and 13-inch displays. Apple also makes 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Pros. Apple may be looking to introduce a new price point for its notebooks range by launching a 12-inch model, or it could be planning to remove the 11-inch version from the range completely . In this image, the rumoured 12-inch MacBook Air is compared to Apple's iPad. Reports claim the tech giant is preparing to launch a ‘radically new design’ for its Air range in 2015 that ditches USB ports and SD cards to make it super thin. The source of the leaked images has not been revealed, so they can’t be verified . The photo was reportedly taken at Apple manufacturer Foxconn's factory in China and is said to measure approximately 12 inches high by 8.7 inches wide. It followed a leaked sketch that claimed to show one corner of the so-called megapad. Other rumours suggest the tablet could have a 12.9-inch screen.","The leaked photos were published on Chinese Apple fan site iFanr .

"Up to 11 party leaders could take part in election debates after Labour said Northern Ireland’s parties should not be excluded. Broadcasters last week made a ‘take it or leave it’ offer for a seven-way debate between the leaders of the all the major political parties in England, Scotland and Wales. It came after David Cameron threatened to boycott the debates unless the Green Party were invited to take part alongside Labour, the Lib Dems and Ukip. Scroll down for video . Tory leader David Cameron has come under pressure to sign up to debates with Lib Dem Nick Clegg and Labour's Ed Miliband . The new plan also includes (left to right) SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon Green leader Natalie Bennett and Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood . Ukip leader Nigel Farage has been invited to the debates, but Labour have said Northern Ireland's parties should be involved. The province's First Minister, DUP leader Peter Robinson (right), and Deputy First Minister, Sinn Fein's Martin McGuinness, could now take part . Northern Ireland's Alliance Party MP Naomi Long (left) and SDLP leader Alasdair McDonnell MP (centre) may also push to be involved in the debate. Respect MP George Galloway has also vowed to push for a place . The new schedule proposed two debates involving seven leaders – one on BBC and one on ITV – with a third, on Channel 4 and Sky, which would be a head-to-head clash between Mr Cameron and Ed Miliband only. Along with the Tories, Labour, Lib Dems and Ukip, TV executives have extended the invitation to the Green Party, the Scottish Nationalist Party and Welsh nationalists Plaid Cymru. Labour last week appeared to sign up to the deal – while the Tories and Lib Dems said they were ‘considering’ the proposal. But a Labour source this evening suggested Northern Ireland’s political parties should not be kept out of the debate. The source told the website Politics Home: ‘We can see no good reason to treat NI differently to the rest of the UK in these debates.’ If broadcasters accepted the proposal there would be at least eight parties involved – but possibly up to 11 if all Northern Ireland’s parties were also invited. Sinn Fein – Northern Ireland’s second biggest party – do not take up their seats in Parliament but have warned they would challenge any attempt to discriminate against them. A party spokesman said: ‘Sinn Fein will take every opportunity to present and promote its policies and positions.’ The DUP's leader, Northern Ireland First Minister Peter Robinson, has written to the broadcasters and Ofcom stating that the proposal is ‘unacceptable’. The Tories pushed for the debates to happen in 2010, when Mr Clegg was seen to have have triumphed over Mr Cameron and Gordon Brown . Channel 4/Sky News . Candidates: David Cameron and Ed Miliband .

He said: ‘In light of the extension of the debates to smaller and regional parties, the failure of the broadcasters to invite the DUP to participate is inexplicable. ‘The broadcasters' decision cannot logically or legally be defended. George Galloway, the Respect Party’s sole MP, has also demanded his inclusion. Mr Farage, who had been the main beneficiary of the original format proposed by the broadcasters, said the revised offer had made the programmes less likely to take place. ‘You can't have a debate with seven people on the podium. And if you are going to have seven, you have got to have the Northern Irish DUP, they are after all the fourth biggest party in Parliament,’ he told Channel 4 News. ‘The broadcasters made a decision, Ofcom backed that decision up: there are four major parties in British politics. ‘Mr Cameron, I'm afraid, has managed to upset the whole debate, to dilute the thing. And I think these debates are now looking less likely to happen than they were before.’ The PM had thrown scheduling plans into chaos after refusing to take part unless Green leader Natalie Bennett was offered a place at the podium. Her inclusion put pressure on Downing Street to agree to the debates – even though ongoing unrest among other smaller and regional parties threatens to scupper the screenings altogether. Broadcasters said they had made the changes after reviewing the ‘electoral landscape’ but issued a clear warning that they would ‘empty chair’ any leader who refused to turn up. The original proposal was for one debate featuring the PM and Ed Miliband, a second including Mr Clegg and a third with the addition of Ukip leader Nigel Farage. The row over the exclusion of the Greens has sparked an apparent surge in support for the party, which saw it pick up several points in the polls and thousands of new members. Leader Miss Bennett described the decision to include her party as ‘groundbreaking’ and the apparent surge in support as a ‘Green Spring’. The group of major broadcasters said that since the initial proposal they had monitored ‘the electoral landscape’ and taken into account polling data and ‘expressions of public support for the debates to go ahead and for a wider range of parties to be included in the debates’. The proposed dates for the debates are April 2, 16 and 30 – with the final clash exactly a week ahead of the General Election poll on May 7.","Broadcasters agreed to David Cameron's demand for a role for the Greens .

"Cyber Caliphate, a group with extremist IS sympathies, has claimed that it hijacked the Malaysia Airlines website, replacing the booking page with pictures showing an error message reading '404 - Plane Not Found' The Wall Street Journal reported that visitors to MalaysiaAirlines.com saw for several hours on Monday a message that said 'ISIS WILL PREVAIL' at the top of their browser’s window.

Instead, a large picture of a Malaysia Airlines A380 plane and the messages '404-Plane Not Found' and “Hacked by Cyber Caliphate” were displayed. Scroll down for video .

'Hacked by Lizard Squad, Official Cyber Caliphate,' it said, giving the Twitter handle for a group called Lizard Squad.

"A Labor MP has demanded Prime Minister Tony Abbott provides evidence that he is no longer a British citizen. Terri Butler, MP for Griffith in Queensland, questioned the PM over whether he is still a dual citizen after being contacted ‘on numerous occasions on social media’ by blogger Tony Magrathea, from the Sunshine Coast. Mr Abbott was born in London, England, in 1957 to an Australian mother and English father and came to Australia in 1960 as an assisted migrant. He applied for Australian citizenship in 1981, becoming a dual citizen of Australia and Britain, and then reportedly – on an undisclosed date – renounced his British citizenship. If Mr Abbott is still a British citizen he would not be eligible to be Prime Minister. Scroll down for video . Labor MP Terri Butler has written a letter to Prime Minister Tony Abbott asking him about his citizenship . The PM was born in London, England, in 1957 to an Australian mother and English father . Mr Magrathea is said to have emailed politicians across the country asking them if they were purposely staying quiet about the PM allegedly being a dual citizen, Independent Australia reports. The blogger previously reportedly submitted a Freedom of Information request to the Prime Minister's office and the British Home Office seeking a copy of Mr Abbott’s RN form. The form is used by British subjects to renounce their citizenship. As part of the Australian constitution, people who hold dual citizenship are not permitted to stand for election to Federal Parliament. In his email to MPs, Mr Magrathea wrote: ‘The Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet declared in an FOI request, 2014-159, in October last year, that Mr Abbott is still a dual citizen of Britain and Australia.’ Ms Butler is thought to be the only MP who responded to Mr Magrathea’s email. She promised to write to Mr Abbott and ask him to provide the requested RN form as evidence. Ms Butler sent the letter on Friday and asked him to provide Mr Magarathea 'with a copy of the declaration of renunciation' that he received when he renounced his British citizenship . In her letter to the Mr Abbott on Friday, Ms Butler wrote: . 'I have received an email from a Mr Tony Magarthea who asserts that you have yet to renounce your British citizenship, I enclose my response to Mr Magrathea. 'I make no claim that you are ineligible to sit in the House of Representatives, that your election was void, or that you have failed to renounce your British citizenship. I have seen no evidence that would satisfy me of any such claim(s). 'However, I also have no desire to continue to receive, and respond to, communications questioning your eligibility under section 44(i) of the Constitution. 'For that reason, I believe it would assist if you would provide Mr Magrathea with a copy of the declaration of renunciation that you received after renouncing your citizenship. Alternatively, it would assist if you would advise the date of your renunciation. ‘Thank you, in advance, for considering this letter.' However, a spokesperson for Ms Butler told Daily Mail Australia the MP believes ‘it’s a non-issue’. He confirmed Ms Butler has not received a response yet, but highlighted the letter was ‘only posted on Friday.’ ‘Terri’s got no view on Tony’s citizenship,’ the spokesperson said. ‘He’d [Tony Magrathea] contacted her on numerous occasions on social media and she was just making sure the guy got some sort of reply,’ he explained. ‘Terri believes the battleground with the LNP is on policy and ideology not on citizenship, she’d be highly surprised if he wasn’t a citizen in the 2013 election… she won’t be taking any further action. ‘She was just making sure this guy got a reply from a parliamentary representative, she doesn’t think it is an issue or ever was an issue. Mr Abbott (centre) applied for Australian citizenship in 1981, becoming a dual citizen of Australia and Britain, and studied at Oxford University in England . The PM's office previously denied that Mr Abbott (right, next to British Prime Minister David Cameron) is still a dual citizen . ‘She stated clearly in her letter we should be concerned on policies and ideologues,’ the spokesperson added. Daily Mail Australia has contacted the Prime Minister’s Office for comment. Meanwhile, a Change.org petition demanding 'Show the public your British Citizenship renunciation form' currently has over 25,000 signatures. The petition reads: 'Section 44 of the Australian Constitution forbids anyone holding dual citizenship from being elected to Parliament. Tony Abbott's refusal (under FOI request) to provide his Form RN renouncing his British citizenship before being elected (26 March 1994), raises serious questions about his legality as a Member of Parliament.' On September 18 2014, Jan Olson requested to see Mr Abbott's official confirmation of renunciation of British citizenship under the Freedom of Information Act. MP Terri Butler has explained that she just wants to help Mr Abbott 'put the issue to bed' Her request was denied by Robert McMahon, the Assistant Secretary of the Parliamentary and Government Branch, because 'no documents relevant to the request are in the possession of the Department'. The Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet said 'no relevant documents were found' when they searched for them. Also in September, NineMsn were told by the Prime Minister's Office and the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet  that Mr Abbott has renounced his British Citizenship. 'The Prime Minister is an Australian citizen and does not hold citizenship of any other country,' the Department reportedly said.","MP Terri Butler wrote to the Prime Minister on Friday .

"A woman who was allegedly gang-raped by four Vanderbilt football players while she was unconscious vomited in court today as one of the men testified that he has no memory of the attack. Cory Batey, 20, took the stand in Nashville, Tennessee on Monday and testified that he woke up the morning after the alleged assault in June 2013 and found explicit photos on his cellphone of him and the woman as he got ready for church. He said he did not recognize her. 'I was horrified,' Batey said. 'I didn't know how they got there. I didn't know what had happened to the young lady in the pictures and and I immediately deleted them.' The graphic images, which allegedly show the men sexually assaulting the 21-year-old neuroscience student after a night of partying, were previously shown to the jury. On the stand: Cory Batey testified in his rape trial on Monday that he had no recollection of attacking an unconscious woman in a Vanderbilt dorm room in June 2013. He and three other men are accused . Witnesses have also testified that Batey slapped and urinated on the student as she lay unconscious in the dorm room. But after the alleged assault came to light, Batey told authorities that he had not touched the girl, the court heard on Monday. 'I just went along with the storyline of what [fellow defendant Brandon] Banks had told me because I had no recollection of what had happened,' he responded. He said he could not remember anything because he had consumed so much alcohol the night before. Last week, the jury heard that he had had as many as 22 drinks. 'I was just drunk out of my mind,' he testified on Monday. 'This is something I would never do in my right state of mind. I'm just sorry.' He repeatedly said that he could not remember details of the days after the alleged attack, including messages he sent to other men accused of trying to cover up the incident. Evidence: Batey looks through text messages he exchanged with his girlfriend and friends after the alleged attack. He repeatedly told attorneys he could not remember messages he sent in the days following . Accused: Brandon Vandenburg, pictured in court on Monday, is also on trial for allegedly raping the woman in the dorm room. He was dating her at the time and 'egged on' the other players, according to testimony . But he admitted to jurors that he was in the graphic images they saw. He said he took responsibility. 'So, Mr. Batey, today you say that you are accepting responsibility for your actions?' asked Roger Moore, one of the prosecutors in the case. 'Does that mean you are changing your plea?' Batey said no. The former football player, who carried 'The Bible Promise Book' to the witness stand, looked at the jury as he responded to questions. He appeared nervous while on the stand, repeatedly licking his lips as he answered the attorneys. The victim, who has attended the 11 days of testimony, at one point vomited during Batey's testimony, The Tennessean reported. The woman, who last week said that she has no recollection of being sexually assaulted, cried during his testimony and bent forward, prompting a court official to inquire if she was OK. Batey was 19 and had just come out of his freshman year when he and three of his teammates were charged with raping an unconscious student in a dorm on the Nashville campus in June 2013. 'Attackers': Jaborian 'Tip' McKenzie, left, and Brandon Banks, right, are also accused in the rape case . On Friday, an expert witness for the defense testified that Batey was so drunk after consuming between 14 and 22 drinks that his ability to 'act knowingly' was impaired. 'He was so intoxicated he was not his normal self,' Dr. James Walker, a forensic neuropsychologist said. 'He was doing things he would not normally have done.' After allegedly raping the woman - in a brutal attack that was captured in cell phone footage and sent to Vandenburg's friends - Batey spent the night with his girlfriend, the court heard. As details of the attack started to emerge, his girlfriend asked him what had happened. On trial: Batey, pictured, was 19 when he allegedly assaulting the woman after a night of drinking . 'You are asking questions I can't answer,' he texted her in response. Batey's defense team has said that his judgment was changed by a campus culture of binge drinking and promiscuous sex. 'Batey did exactly what his college culture told him,' his defense attorney, Worrick Robinson said in his closing arguments. But in her closing arguments on Monday afternoon, prosecutor Jan Norman pointed out that voluntary intoxication is not a defense for aggravated rape. 'The only person that was unconscious and unaware of what was going on (was the victim),' she said. The incident only came to light only after Vanderbilt officials reviewed a dormitory surveillance video following a report of vandalism. When they reviewed the footage, they saw an unconscious woman being dragged into a dorm room. They called Nashville police, who opened an investigation. The assault lasted for 29 minutes but police only recovered footage one minute long, Norman told the jury in her closing arguments. The closing arguments will wrap up on Tuesday and then the jury will deliberate. Batey is on trial with Brandon Vandenburg, 21, who had been dating the woman at the time of the alleged assault. Two other men, Jaborian 'Tip' McKenzie and Brandon Banks, are also accused in the attack but are not on trial yet. All are charged with five counts of aggravated rape and two counts of aggravated sexual battery. Vandenburg additionally faces a charge of unlawful photography and tampering with evidence. They have all pleaded not guilty.","Cory Batey took the stand in his rape trial in Nashville on Monday .

"Josh Dorgu, 18, died after collapsing in front of fellow pupils during an A-level maths class at Highgate School in north London . A promising 18-year-old schoolboy died after collapsing in front of fellow pupils during an A-level maths class. Josh Dorgu, 18, suffered a cardiac arrest and staff at Highgate School in north London tried to resuscitate him but failed. He was taken by ambulance to the Royal Free Hospital where he died with his father, the Rev Karowei Dorgu, vicar of St John The Evangelist Church, and mother Dr Mosun Dorgu, by his side. A special service was held in the school's chapel on Wednesday, packed full of Josh's friends, who lit candles in his memory. Close family friend Lloyd Milo, a warden at St John's, said: 'Josh was a wonderful boy. He was like a grandson to me and my wife Ann. We have just been at the family's house. They are doing the best they can. People are coming in and out to see them.' Josh's parents and older brother Timi said prayers for the keen Arsenal fan at the Upper Holloway church on Sunday. Pupils have created a 'memory board' where they are able to pin notes celebrating their memories of Josh. One minute of silence was also held before all Highgate sports matches on Saturday in memory of the 18-year-old. A book of condolence has been opened in the school's chapel for pupils, staff and parents to sign. Headmaster Adam Pettitt said: 'This is a terrible tragedy for Josh's family, the school and its community. 'Josh was a lively, intelligent young man of strong faith, with an irrepressible gift for making people laugh.' Mr Pettitt said: 'The pupils, especially Josh's friends and peers, have conducted themselves magnificently in the face of this terrible news. One minute of silence was also held before all Highgate sports matches on Saturday in memory of the 18-year-old . Staff at Highgate School in north London (pictured) tried to perform CPR on his chest, but they were unable to resuscitate him . 'Josh's parents are receiving much warm and expert support from the church community, family, friends and colleagues. 'We know that they are keen to involve his friends and the school in arrangements for his funeral to mark his passing and celebrate his life. 'The thoughts and prayers of the whole Highgate community are with them.' A school spokeswoman said: 'The exact reasons for his collapse are not yet known, but we understand he was treated for a cardiac incident.' One parent who had known Josh for several years described him as the 'kindest child'. He said schools should invite children to have cardiac screening in order to pick up any undetected heart abnormality. The parent said in an online message: 'I would hope that, if something good was to come out of this tragedy, it would be that this problem is highlighted in the media and that more teenagers are offered this non-invasive test in all schools.' A spokesperson for the London Ambulance Service said: 'We were called at 3.26pm to reports of a person unwell at a school in Highgate. 'We sent two responders by car, an ambulance crew and an advanced paramedic to the scene. 'We treated an 18-year-old in cardiac arrest at the scene.He was taken to Royal Free Hospital as a priority.'

"A sex themed park is in the works in Taiwan. Tourism officials' surefire plan to draw in more visitors will be built on a 37-mile stretch of land along the coast. The park, to be called Romantic Boulevard, will feature heart-shaped arches, a glass church and outdoor garden filled with erotic sculptures of people and animals in 'various lovemaking positions.' Scroll down for video . A sex themed park is in the works in Taiwan, said to be modelled after South Korea's Jeju Loveland (pictured) Unlike Jeju Loveland, Romantic Boulevard also hopes to include a 'scenic area' for wedding photos . 'We want people to fall in love with Taiwan, as well as fall in love while in Taiwan, Shih Chao-hui, the deputy director of Southwest Coast National Scenic Area Office, told the Wall Street Journal. The proposed park will likely be modelled after the similarly sex themed Jeju Loveland in South Korea. Jeju Loveland, which opened in 2014, likewise boasts racy statues. Still in the early phases of development, Romantic Boulevard also plans to include a 'scenic area' for couples to take wedding portraits. According to Shih, over 200,000 people visited the site earlier this month.

"Health experts have warned that 'killer' winter storms could hit Britain over the next 48 hours with temperatures set to plunge to 2C with a wind-chill factor making it seem far colder. A storm front from the arctic is set to hit Britain over the coming hours with a Level 2 cold weather alert in operation across the Midlands, the North and the East of England. Forecasters warn there is an 80 per cent chance of severe cold and heavy snow across affected areas. Scroll down for video .

Animation: This shows the jet stream moving to the south of the UK, with colder air from the Arctic going southwards to affect the UK . The Met Office's Eddy Carroll said: 'A cold front is expected to cross the UK during Wednesday, introducing much colder conditions to central and northern England in particular. 'Very strong winds will accentuate the cold. Snow showers are likely in most areas, but especially the north west where significant accumulations are likely to build up, especially in hilly areas.' Dr Angie Bone, a Public Health England boss, said: 'In this sort of weather we know that older people and people in poor health tend to stay indoors. 'While this is sensible, it’s worth remembering these people may need help getting to a hospital or GP appointment, with shopping or prescription fetching, or just someone to talk to. 'Although most of our advice on keeping warm and well in cold weather may seem like common sense, it’s important to remember that cold kills, even in places where the temperatures aren’t at their lowest.' But be warned, by the end of this week, you may be building a snowman or cursing traffic chaos caused by an icy whiteout. The Met Office has issued a yellow weather alert ahead of the cold snap with wintry showers expected in northern England, Scotland and Northern Ireland on Wednesday and Thursday. The warning urges drivers to be safe on the roads and to be prepared for possible weather-related delays. Some areas could see snow of up to 2in on low levels and more than 4in on higher ground. By the weekend, temperatures will again dip below zero. The Met Office has issued a 'level two' cold weather alert, which warns of an 80 per cent chance of severe weather between Wednesday and Sunday. John Lee, a forecaster at MeteoGroup, said: ‘There is a definite trend for it getting colder as the week goes on. 'Be aware': The Met Office has  severe weather warnings for snow in place for northern parts of Britain tomorrow (left) and Thursday (right) Three-day forecast: Strong and gusty winds are likely to accompany snow showers and lead to significantly reduced visibility at times .

'We will already see wintry showers from Wednesday in some parts of the country. ‘By the weekend there is a risk of snow anywhere. It will definitely be cold enough.’ The predicted snow at the end of the week combined with strong winds could mean reduced visibility for drivers. The Met Office said: ‘An active cold front is expected to push south-east across the UK during Wednesday introducing an increasingly cold and unstable air mass. ‘Showers will become frequent and heavy, increasingly falling as snow in the North and West, and driven well inland by strong to gale force north-westerly winds. Accumulating snow is likely, especially overnight.’ Wintry scene: The Wiltshire countryside had a beautiful covering of frost around Malmesbury and the River Avon on Sunday .

People have been advised to stay indoors and look out for friends and family who may be vulnerable to the cold as the chill factor sets in because of northerly winds. Dr Angie Bone, head of extreme events team at Public Health England, said: ‘Although many parts of the country have already seen colder weather this winter, it does look like we're in for a further spell with bitter winds and snow showers likely to make it feel particularly cold. ‘In this sort of weather we know that older people and people in poor health tend to stay indoors. ‘While this is sensible, it's worth remembering these people may need help getting to a hospital or GP appointment, with shopping or prescription fetching, or just someone to talk to. ‘If you know someone in this situation, and most of us do, think about what you can you do to help out. ‘Contrary to popular belief, it's actually working age adults who have most slips and trips outside in cold and icy weather, not older people, which is why it's important to wear shoes with a good, slip-resistant grip to prevent any accidental falls.

On Wednesday night many will begin to feel the cold again with temperatures falling to -2C in the North and -1C in the South. In the North, sleet and snow are expected to cover the ground overnight with wintry showers and winds blasting the South. Despite the cold snap, nature experts say spring is already well on the way. Sightings of snowdrops, hazel catkins and even ladybirds and butterflies have been submitted to the Woodland Trust’s Nature’s Calendar scheme, which asks the public to report natural events which mark the changing seasons.

In November, the Trust received a record of frogspawn on the Lizard Peninsula, Cornwall, the earliest such incidence for nine years. Research looking at nature records stretching back to the 18th century has found flowers over the last 25 years blooming up to 12 days earlier than previously. This year’s sightings come after the warmest year on record for the UK. The current freezing conditions may halt the march of spring, but conservationists say that causes less of a problem than a late cold snap, as happened in 2013, when more species are likely to be awake from hibernation or already flowering.

"A chief fire officer raped a woman in a village pub as his unwitting wife sat drinking just yards away, a court heard yesterday. Sean Frayne, 48, allegedly followed the woman into an unused section of the building and made polite conversation before ‘forcefully’ raping her. A court heard she kept quiet about the alleged attack for seven years until she eventually broke down and confided in a friend at a family wedding. Accused: Chief fire officer Sean Frayne is pictured arriving at Derby Crown Court for his rape trial today . Once the ‘secret was out’, Frayne is alleged to have taken his wife along to confront the woman over her allegations. The father of three earns £140,000 a year as the chief of Derbyshire’s Fire and Rescue Service. A jury was told he admitted having sex with the woman but would claim it was consensual and instigated by her. Prosecutor Martin Hurst told the court that following the alleged sex attack in December 2006, Frayne returned to his wife Helen, who was sitting in the bar area, ‘as if nothing had happened’. The jury was told the woman did not tell anybody about the alleged rape at the time, because of problems in her personal life. But after she ‘poured her heart out’ to a male friend at the wedding in 2013, the man sent Frayne anonymous letters in red ink which accused him of raping her. The notes said she would ‘accept an out-of-court settlement’ to ‘avoid publicity’ and included a phone number to contact. They threatened to report Frayne to police if he did not respond. Claim: Frayne, pictured left in his uniform and right leaving court, is accused of the crime dating back to 2006 . The woman told police she knew nothing about the male friend’s attempt to ‘achieve some sort of informal justice’ on her behalf by sending the letters. Jurors were told she was left ‘in complete shock’ when the Fraynes visited her to ask questions about the letters. During the meeting the defendant asked the woman if they ‘kissed and cuddled’, and said he could ‘remember being in the room then going and being sick’. Mr Hurst said: ‘The prosecution say he was hoping all this may go away and was being explained to his wife as a drunken snog and grope.’ The woman made a formal complaint to the police in December 2013. She told officers that during the meeting with the couple, Mrs Frayne had asked her to describe intimate areas of her husband’s body. In a videotaped interview played to Derby Crown Court, the woman, who was in her 40s at the time, told police: ‘They could remember everything about that night. It was so strange.’ Trial: Derby Crown Court, pictured, heard that Frayne insists he had consensual sex with the alleged victim . During the interview, she described how Frayne exchanged pleasantries with her before suddenly attacking her. She said: ‘He grabbed my hand and put it behind me and went towards my trousers. ‘He turned me round and I ended up face down. I remember shouting, and I don’t normally swear, “**** you, you b******”.’ She said the force of the attack caused a button to fall off her trousers. Afterwards, she said, Frayne ‘just left’. The woman added: ‘I was left there and he was gone. I went to the toilet. I think I found my button on the floor first. I was stunned, horrified.’ Asked by the interviewing officer if she wanted to have sex with him, she replied: ‘No.’ She added: ‘I put my hand there to stop him. Whether or not I actually said “no”, I can’t remember.’ The court heard the Fraynes stopped visiting the pub in Etwall, Derbyshire, shortly after the alleged rape. Frayne, who is suspended from duty, told police the woman turned around and kissed him passionately, before touching him to initiate sex. Mr Hurst told the jury: ‘The question is whether she was consenting. ‘If it is as she says, it is rape. If it as he says, that she instigated it and caused it to happen, that is not rape.’ He said the defence will say the case was ‘all about (getting) compensation out of a successful man’. But pointing out the time lapse between the alleged rape and the sending of the letters, he asked the jury: ‘If it’s all about money, why all the continuing delay?’ Frayne, of Huddersfield in West Yorkshire, denies rape. The trial, expected to last three days, continues. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Sean Frayne, 48, allegedly attacked a woman in a Derbyshire pub .

"Common over-the-counter hayfever pills could raise your risk of Alzheimer’s, warn researchers. They found a link between dementia in older people and anticholinergic drugs, which include the antihistamines Benadryl and Piriton, as well as sleep remedy Nytol and some older antidepressants. These medications affect the brain by blocking a key chemical messenger called acetylcholine, which has a range of functions in the body. Popular hayfever pills such as Benadryl and Piriton, sleep remedy Nytol, Ditropan - which is used to treat an overactive bladder, and the antidepressant doxepin have all been linked to dementia . The dementia risk is greatest when high doses are taken over several years, the US study found. Many of the drugs are more commonly taken by older people, with up to half of the UK’s elderly population being prescribed at least one anticholinergic medication. Study leader Professor Shelly Gray, of the University of Washington School of Pharmacy, said no one should simply stop taking the drugs without speaking to their doctor. Researchers found a link between anticholinergic medications and dementia. Anticholinergic medications affect the brain by blocking a key chemical messenger called acetycholine, which has a range of functions in the body. People taking the following drugs for more than three years have an increased risk of dementia: . For those taking the highest doses of these drugs, the risk of dementia was increased by 54 per cent after seven years, compared with no use. The risk of Alzheimer's - the most common form of dementia - was increased by 63 per cent. But she said: ‘Healthcare providers should regularly review their older patients’ drug regimens, including over-the-counter medications, to look for chances to use fewer anticholinergic medications at lower doses.’ Research last year linked the use of anticholinergic drugs with mental impairment in the elderly. But the new study, in the journal JAMA Internal Medicine, is the first to show that the higher the dose, the higher the risk of dementia. Researchers tracked 3,434 men and women aged 65 and over for around seven years while monitoring their use of anticholinergic drugs. Of the total, 637 developed Alzheimer’s and 160 were affected by other forms of dementia. For those taking the biggest doses of anticholinergic drugs, the risk of dementia was 54 per cent higher than those using none. The risk of Alzheimer’s was 63 per cent higher. Of the drugs named in the study, an increased risk of dementia was seen in people taking at least 10mg a day of the antidepressant doxepin, 4mg a day of diphenhydramine (which is in Nytol and Benadryl) or 5mg a day of oxybutynin (Ditropan) for an overactive bladder for at least three years. Many newer drugs to treat these conditions do not have anticholinergic effects, such as the antidepressant Prozac and antihistamines such as loratadine (Claritin). Anticholinergic drugs block a chemical transmitter called acetylcholine, leading to side effects such as drowsiness and poor memory. People with Alzheimer’s disease are known to lack acetylcholine. Dr Simon Ridley, of Alzheimer’s Research UK, said more research was needed, adding: ‘This large study adds to some existing evidence linking anticholinergic drugs to a small increased risk of dementia, but the results don’t tell us that these drugs cause the condition.’ For people who took the highest doses of these drugs for the seven-year study period, the risk of dementia was increased by a statistically significant 54 per cent compared with no use. The risk of Alzheimer's was raised by 63 per cent .","Sleep remedies, hayfever pills and anti-depressants are linked to dementia .

"Syrian rebels beheaded a Christian man and fed his body to dogs, according to a nun who says the West is ignoring atrocities committed by Islamic extremists. The nun said taxi driver Andrei Arbashe, 38, was kidnapped after his brother was heard complaining that fighters against the ruling regime behaved like bandits. She said his headless corpse was found by the side of the road, surrounded by hungry dogs. He had recently married and was soon to be a father. Volatile fighting: The news of the kidnapping and beheading of Mr Arbashe came as pro-government forces celebrated their victory against rebels at the Air Defence Base in Tal Hassil near Aleppo Airport last night . Sister Agnes-Mariam de la Croix said: ‘His only crime was his brother criticised the rebels, accused them of acting like bandits, which is what they are.’ There have been a growing number of accounts of atrocities carried out by rogue elements of the Syrian Free Army, which opposes dictator Bashar al-Assad and is recognised by Britain and the West as the legitimate leadership. Sister Agnes-Miriam, mother superior of the Monastery of St James the Mutilated, has condemned Britain and the west for supporting the rebels despite growing evidence of human rights abuses. Murder, kidnapping, rape and robbery are becoming commonplace, she says. ‘The free and democratic world is supporting extremists,’ Sister Agnes-Miriam said from her sanctuary in Lebanon. ‘They want to impose Sharia Law and create an Islamic state in Syria.’ Fatal: Fighting in Aleppo has intensified with rebel forces specifically targeting air bases. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said fighting led to closure of Aleppo International Airport on Monday . The 60-year-old Carmelite nun claims the west has turned a blind eye to growing evidence of a ‘fifth column’ of fanatics within the rag-tag ranks that make up the Free Syrian Army that they back to oust Assad. One of the most effective fighting forces is the Jabat Al-Nusra, which has an ideology similar to Al Qaeda. ‘The uprising has been hijacked by Islamist mercenaries who are more interested in fighting a holy war than in changing the government,’ she said. ‘It has turned into a sectarian conflict. One in which Christians are paying a high price.’ The rebel attacked the northern town of Ras Al-Ayn, on the Turkish border, last month. The fighters entered the Christian quarter, ordering civilians to leave and leaving their homes. ‘More than 200 families were driven out in the night,’ Sister Agnes-Miriam says. ‘People are afraid. Everywhere the deaths squads stop civilians, abduct them and ask for ransom, sometimes they kill them.’ Threat: Rebel fighters launched a major offensive on Aleppo in mid-July but the city had remained in stalemate until recent weeks . Militants wearing black bandanas of Al Qaeda recently laid siege to the Monastery of St James the Mutilated, located between Damascus and Homs, for two days in an attempt to prevent Christmas celebrations, the nun claims. An estimated 300,000 Christians have been displaced in the conflict, with 80,000 forced out of the Homs region alone, she claims. Many have fled abroad raising fears that Syria’s Christian community may vanish - like others across Middle East, the birthplace of Christianity. Al Assad, a member of the Alawite Muslim sect, claims only his regime can protect Syria’s minorities from domination from the Sunni Muslims majority. Meanwhile the fighting continues to rage with government forces retaking control of a key district in the city of Homs yesterday. The latest violence comes after United Nations peace envoy Lakhdar Brahimi warned of ‘hell’ for Syria if no political solution could be found. Russia has stated the conflict is becoming increasingly militarised and sectarian and risks bringing chaos to the whole region. Some 44,000 people have been killed since the uprising against the Al Assad regime began in March 2011.","Christian Andrei Arbashe, 38, was kidnapped and beheaded by rebel fighters in northern town of Ras Al-Ayn on the Turkish border .

"Prime Minister David Cameron has pledged to cut the current £26,000 welfare cap to £23,000 within days of the Tories winning the general election . Tens of thousands of families where no one works will have their benefits slashed, David Cameron is to pledge today. The current £26,000 cap would be cut to £23,000 within days of the Tories winning the general election, the Prime Minister will say. As the campaign enters its final 100 days with two polls showing his party has moved into a narrow lead, Mr Cameron is also promising tax relief for the middle classes. He is determined to ensure welfare is no longer a 'lifestyle choice', while rewarding those who are in work. He will pledge that the Conservatives would reduce the limit on handouts to jobless families within a week of being re-elected. Housing benefit would be removed from jobless 18 to 21-year-olds, meaning they will have to live with their parents like millions of youngsters starting out in a job. The new cuts would squeeze the incomes of 100,000 jobless households and raise money to be ploughed into apprenticeships for three million school leavers. The Coalition has already introduced a welfare cap of £26,000 per household in what polls suggest is one of its most popular policies. However, further welfare cuts have been hampered by Liberal Democrat opposition. Reducing the cap to £23,000 – equivalent to a pre-tax salary of around £29,300 – would hit an additional 70,000 workless households and save taxpayers an extra £135million per year, while the housing benefit squeeze on younger jobseekers would apply to 30,000 claimants and save a further £120million. Only claimants of Disability Living Allowance would be exempt from the new cap. In a swipe at Labour and the Liberal Democrats, Mr Cameron yesterday attacked the 'lie' that Britain would be better off paying more tax to continue funding higher benefits. He said there was an 'economic, moral and practical' case for lower taxes, insisting British people 'deserve a reward' following years of austerity. Reducing the welfare cap by £3,000 to £23,000 – equivalent to a pre-tax salary of around £29,300 – would hit an additional 70,000 workless households and save taxpayers an extra £135million per year (file picture) David Cameron today signalled that he will protect benefits for Britain's wealthiest pensioners. The Prime Minister insisted there were not big savings to be made from cutting winter fuel payments, TV licences and bus passes for the well-off. It raises the prospect of the Tories being the only major party going into the election vowing to preserve the payments for all over-65s, while cutting welfare for people of working age. Mr Cameron told BBC Radio4's Today programme: 'I've always said that there aren't huge savings to be made from axing these benefits and I think pensioners welcome the clarity that there has been. 'I don't think it would be fair to ask pensioners to make the biggest adjustment. 'Because when you are a pensioner it's more difficult to adjust your circumstances. 'I think that was the right commitment to make because dignity and security in old age should be part of the promise we make to people in our country.' He admitted that too many people have been sucked into the 40p income tax band, including teachers and police officers. The Tories are pledging to increase the threshold for the 40p rate to £50,000 by 2020. Mr Cameron said today: 'Conservatives believe we should be giving people the chance of a better future – while encouraging people on benefits back into work. 'For years we had a welfare system that kept people subsidised in poverty and forgot about them. Hard-working taxpayers were left to pick up the tab – and often they had lower incomes than those they supported on welfare. This is about ending that injustice. 'We are saying loud and clear that welfare is a safety net for those in hard times, not a lifestyle choice. 'We want to put people's hard-earned taxes into lifting people up, not holding them down – and that's what these three million apprenticeships will do. This is about being ambitious for Britain. We can give many more young people the chance to get on. 'We can help more people into work and out of poverty. We can secure a better future for everyone in Britain – but only if we stick to our long-term plan.' Ministers say the £26,000 benefit cap has already helped encourage more than 12,000 households into work. In total, 51,200 households have had their benefits capped since April 2013. Two polls last night showed the Conservatives ahead of Labour for the first time since September 2011. ComRes put the Tories on 31 per cent (up two points since last month) Labour on 30 (-2), Ukip 17 (+1), Lib Dems 8 (-4) and the Greens 7 (+2). A Survation poll for the Daily Mirror put the Tories on 31 and Labour 30. Ukip were third on 23 – far higher than in most recent surveys. Lord Ashcroft's weekly poll put the two main parties neck and neck on 32 with Ukip on 15, the Greens 9 and the Lib Dems 7. The Prime Minister and Chancellor George Osborne visited Hecks Cider Farm in Street, Somerset, today . The pair took a hands-on approach as they helped empty apples into a machine that presses them for cider . Shadow work and pensions secretary Rachel Reeves said: 'Labour supports a cap on benefits. We will ask an independent commission to look at whether the cap should be lower in some areas. 'But David Cameron can't hide from the fact that his government has spent GBP25 billion more than planned on welfare because of his failure to tackle the low pay that leaves millions dependent on benefits to make ends meet. 'And nobody will believe promises on apprenticeships from a government that had seen the number of apprenticeships for young people fall.' Alison Garnham, chief executive of Child Poverty Action Group, said: 'Let's be absolutely clear - the benefit cap is at least nine times more likely to affect children than adults, and the majority of adults it hits are lone parents, many of whom have children so young even the Government recognises they should not be required to work. 'Britain is facing a looming child poverty crisis; lowering the benefit cap would bring it several steps closer. It would pile on the misery for working and non-working families already struggling to pay for absolute basics. 'Surely it would also fail the Prime Minister's own family test. Rather than taking away money from the poorest, politicians of all parties need to tackle the root causes of higher social security spending, which include soaring childcare and housing costs and low pay.'","David Cameron pledging to cut current welfare cap of £26,000 by £3,000 .

"Fears of a run on Greek banks grew last night as it emerged investors withdrew £6billion from the country in the run-up to the election of the far-left Syriza party. Alexis Tsipras, the fiercely anti-austerity prime minister, has pledged to renegotiate the terms of Greece’s £185billion bailout from the EU and IMF, claiming the repayments are crippling.

Fighting talk: Syriza leader Alexis Tsipras said his 'priority will be to restore the country's lost dignity' Face-off: Mr Tsipras says he will not bow to demands by German Chancellor Angela Merkel (right) That uncertainty explained the recent withdrawal of the £6billion. There is also concern that Syriza’s success could signal victories for anti-austerity parties elsewhere. In Spain, Podemos is threatening a similar breakthrough in an election later this year. The party’s leader, Pablo Iglesias, said: ‘The Greeks are going to have a true Greek president and not a delegate of German chancellor Angela Merkel, who will put the interests of his country and his people first. Hope is coming, fear is fleeing. We are hoping we will hear the same thing in Spain soon.’ But Spain’s conservative prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, warned voters against following Greece’s example: ‘We cannot bet our future and that of our children in a frivolous game of Russian roulette.’ Chancellor George Osborne said Mr Tsipras’s demands appeared ‘incompatible’ with membership of the European single currency. Symbolism: Alexis Tsipras lays flowers on the National Resistance Memorial in Athens, on the site where on May 1, 1944, 200 communist resistance fighters and political prisoners were executed by German soldiers . Making history: A tie-less Alexis Tsipras, aged just 40, being sworn in as prime minister yesterday . All smiles: The party leader in a bouyant mood yesterday - but the battles will begin almost immediately . He and David Cameron backed Mrs Merkel’s insistence that there was no prospect of cancelling Greece’s debts. But Vince Cable opened up another coalition rift – and risked infuriating allies in Germany and Brussels – by insisting a deal must be done with Mr Tsipras. ‘There is no reason for the situation in Greece to lead to another eurozone crisis, said the Lib Dem business secretary. ‘Several European countries have enjoyed substantial debt relief in the past and many emerging economies have done so in more recent times. ‘And whilst we can’t expect government creditors to sign a blank cheque, I hope European leaders will sit down urgently for discussions with the new Greek government. ‘We need a sensible outcome coupled with much needed economic reforms to provide eurozone growth. The revival of growth and success in the eurozone is in Britain’s best interests, for the success of the many millions of British jobs linked to trade with Europe.’ Syriza fell just short of an outright majority in Greece’s parliamentary election, winning 149 of 300 seats. But Mr Tsipras was sworn in as prime minister with the support of the right-wing Independent Greeks, who won 13 seats. They are also violently anti-austerity. Jubilant: Syriza fell just short of an outright majority in Greece’s election, but that didn't stop its supporters . Emotional: A supporter reacts as projections suggested Syriza was due to receive around 149 seats . Mr Tsipras, a 40-year-old former communist, is demanding a European debt conference that would abolish or restructure large amounts of Greek debt, as was done for post-war Germany in 1953. In a provocative move, apparently designed to tap into a growing anti-German sentiment in Greece, his first act as prime minister yesterday was to lay a rose at a memorial to Greek victims of the Nazis. A German finance ministry spokesman reiterated Berlin’s opposition to debt forgiveness, saying: ‘You know our attitude to a debt cut. That remains unchanged.’ However, an extension of Greek debt was a ‘possibility’. Mr Cameron said the failures of previous economic plans in Greece had led to the rise of Syriza. ‘What the Greek elections show is that you need to have an economic plan that works,’ added the Prime Minister. ‘The Greek voters were revolting against failure, economic failure; a country whose economy had shrunk, whose unemployment was unacceptably high and they couldn’t see a secure future. 'There are some warning signs, some danger signs in the global economy – instability in the eurozone, less rapid growth from the developing economies – these warning signs point even more to the importance of sticking to our long-term economic plan that is delivering rather than taking a risk with the people who got us into this mess.’ Greece's Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras waves to the members of media as he arrives at Maximos Mansion . Ukip leader Nigel Farage said: ‘This is a desperate cry for help from the Greek people, millions of whom have been impoverished by the euro experiment. ‘An extraordinary game of poker will now begin with Chancellor Merkel. For too long the Greeks have been the sacrificial lamb on the altar of a failed federalist project – the euro. ‘Being in the wrong currency union has imposed a financial and social nightmare on the Greek people, from which they are now waking up.’ David Davis, a former Tory frontbencher, said last night: ‘The foreign imposition of punitive fiscal constraints on a sovereign state often has the effect of undermining both democracy and stability, as shown most dramatically after the Versailles Treaty. ‘This may be the opportunity to start a serious debate in Europe on the future of the EU.’ The man who is tipped to become Greece’s next finance minister used poetry to make a point on BBC Radio 4 yesterday. Yanis Varoufakis said: ‘The light came yesterday when the Greek democracy chose, to quote your very own Dylan Thomas, to stop going gently into the night, and to rage against the dying of the light.’","Syriza leader Alexis Tsipras wants longer to repay part of £185bn bailout .

"In times of famine, some animals go to desperate measures to stay alive, including eating members of their own species. Now scientists have captured one of the first cases of cannibalism in hippopotamuses on camera. The grisly photographs show a hippo eating a corpse of another floating in a river in South Africa’s Kruger National Park. Scientists have captured one of the first cases of cannibalism in hippopotamuses on camera. The grisly photographs (one pictured) show a hippo eating a corpse of another floating in a river in South Africa’s Kruger National Park. They are not sure why the act occured . They were taken by biologist Leejiah Dorward while on safari last year. He told National Geographic: ‘I was completely amazed. It was something I had never heard of.’ Having returned to London, the PhD student discovered that cannibalism in hippos has only been described once before, in 1999. While hippos are herbivores, other scientists have seen them deviate from their diet of grasses and the occasional aquatic plant to feast on impala - a medium-sized antelope. The other instance of hippo cannibalism occurred during a severe drought. Dr David Pfenning, a biologist at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, explained that cannibalism is one way for creatures to get all the nutrients they need in one convenient package. When Mr Dorward recorded the act of cannibalism, he noticed that the region had lush grass (seen in this image) which makes up the bulk of a hippo's diet. The only other record of cannibalism in the species was seen in the midst of a severe drought . Hippos leave water at dusk to travel up to six miles (10km) inland to graze on grasses. They spend almost all the rest of the time in rivers and lakes. Grass is their main source of food, and they consume around 150lbs (68kg) of it every night, over around five hours. They occasionally eat aquatic plants. There have been reports of hippos eating impala and carrion but their stomachs are not suited to a meaty diet and meat eating is thought to be driven by drought and desperation. Hippos are born with sterile intestines and require bacteria obtained from their mothers' faeces to digest vegetation. For example, Mormon crickets migrate on mass during food shortages and if one stops marching, others will devour it, because their fellow katydid is a good source of protein and salt, needed by the insects. However, animals that feast on their own species run the risk of catching a disease. Most animals usually only resort to eating their own species during times of extreme hardship, when the risk of catching a disease is less then starving to death. Crocodiles, for example, are known to eat their young when there is no other food available and sometimes scavenge corpses. However, when Mr Dorward recorded the act of cannibalism, he noticed that the region had lush grass. The event was documented in the African Journal of Ecology. To solve the mystery of why the hippo ate the corpse, he wants to document other cases of cannibalism in the species in Africa. ‘Because the behaviour is so rare, we are relying on others to report it,’ he said. While hippos are herbivores, other scientists have seen them deviate from their diet of grasses and the occasional aquatic plant to feast on impala – a medium-sized antelope (stock image shown) Desperation: In times of famine, some animals go to desperate measures to stay alive, including eating members of their own species. For example, crocodiles have been known to eat their offspring when no other food is available. Nutrition: Mormon crickets migrate on mass during food shortages and if one stops marching, others will devour it, because their fellow katydid is a good source of protein and salt, needed by the insects. Cannibalism is a convenient way to get all the nutrients an animal needs, but they run the risk of more easily catching diseases. Female rattlesnakes eat stillborn or non-viable offspring to recover some of their strength, Discover reported. Mormon crickets (stock image) migrate on mass during food shortages and if one stops marching, others will devour it, because their fellow katydid is a good source of protein and salt, needed by the insects . Crab spiders eat eggs and their mother over the course of weeks until she is immobile and dies, Science News reported, allowing offspring to be heavier and to have a better chance at survival. Stress: Stressed screech owls have been known to eat a mate when adapting to a new environment, although the behaviour is rare. Sand sharks (stock image) eat their younger siblings while still in the womb to give themselves the best chance of survival . Sex: Male Australian redback spiders are often eaten by females during copulation. While the male perishes, the copulation time is extended, increasing his chance of passing on his genes. The act isn't unusual in spiders and some insects such as the praying mantis. Survival of infants: In what is perhaps the ultimate competition for food, sand sharks eat their younger siblings while still in the womb to give themselves the best chance of survival. Tiger salamanders come in two larval forms - normal and cannibalistic. The cannibals develop faster and have wider jaws and sharper teeth to chomp on their siblings. Dominance and competition: Male lions sometimes kill a younger lion that is challenging leadership of the pride. If the young imposter wins, he may kill cubs to make room for his own offspring. In 1977, famous conservationist Jane Goodall reported cannibalism in male and chimpanzees. It was presumed for years that the act was unusual, but in 2007, experts came to the conclusion that it was a behaviour designed to cut competition for food and mates, after seeing gentler female chimps eating others. Mystery: Sometimes experts have no idea why one animal eats another. Keepers at Smithsonian’s National Zoo in Washington DC saw a mother sloth bear eating one of her own cubs. The mother, named Khali, had raised offspring before, leaving experts baffled as to what prompted her to eat the small bear.","Grisly photographs show a hippo eating a corpse of another floating in a river in South Africa’s Kruger National Park .

"A beloved North Carolina news anchor revealed his ALS diagnosis Friday in an emotional on-air goodbye to viewers after nearly 40 years at the same station. Larry Stogner signed off from WTVD Raleigh last week in a tearful farewell to the station and viewers he'd reported the for daily since 1976. The shocking reveal came just five months after a seemingly healthy Stogner participated in the Ice Bucket Challenge, meant to benefit ALS--also known as Lou Gehrig's Disease--in a segment shown on the air. Emotional: Longtime Raleigh, North Carolina newscaster Larry Stogner gave an emotional goodbye on the air Friday during which he revealed he's been diagnosed with ALS, also known as Lou Gehrig's Disease . 'Little did I know': Stogner had only five months prior to his tearful goodbye participated in the Ice Bucket Challenge to support ALS research . 'Some of you may remember me taking the ALS ice bucket challenge back in the summer,' said Stogner in a steady but labored voice. 'Little did I know, it was about to change my life. There is no cure. My career in broadcast journalism is coming to an end.' Stogner began his tear-jerking goodbye, at least in part, as a means of explaining to viewers why his voice had recently started to sound different on the air. 'I am sure that in recent months, you’ve noticed a change in my voice, my speech slower. Many of you were kind enough to email me ideas about what it might be, or just to show concern, and I truly appreciate that,' he said. 'More personal': Stogner said he would be back in two weeks after vacationing with his wife to give a 'more personal' goodbye . Stogner signed off by saying he was going on vacation with his wife and would be back in a few weeks to offer his loyal viewers a 'more personal' goodbye.

"Ambulance trusts are being forced to recruit paramedics from abroad because of a shortage of British staff. The London Ambulance Service has 175 Australians starting work this month in an attempt to fill staffing gaps. Nearly one in five of its frontline roles is vacant. Six of England’s ten ambulance trusts have recruited or plan to recruit from countries including Australia, Poland and Ireland, according to figures gathered by the Health Service Journal. Ambulance trusts are being forced to recruit paramedics from as far away as Australia because of a shortage in British staff (file picture) In total, 183 paramedics have been brought in from overseas since April, compared with just one in the previous financial year. Across England, an average of nearly one in ten paramedic jobs are vacant. The figure rises to one in four in the East of England, South Central and North East. Last month the Mail reported how a staffing crisis led to 6,000 NHS nurses being recruited from abroad in the 12 months to September 2013 – a four-fold increase on the previous year. The Australian paramedics will work 37.5 hours a week and be paid a salary of between £30,295 and £39,061. They received relocation costs and a three-week training course on working in London, including dealing with incidents on the Underground. LAS bosses travelled to Australia and New Zealand last year, employing three quarters of the 200 graduates they interviewed. They will return there in March for another 280 interviews. Mitchell Hand, from Sydney, said the fact London was the busiest ambulance service in the world, receiving up to 5,000 calls a day, was what attracted him. Six of England’s ten ambulance trusts have recruited or plan to recruit from countries including Australia, Poland and Ireland (file picture) He told BBC Radio 5 Live: ‘That’s what you look for as a graduate. You want to use your skills you’ve spent three years at university learning. It’s the unknown that attracts you here.’ Another new recruit from Sydney, Simone, told the programme: ‘I don’t have plans to go back home because the career advancement is too good.’ An LAS spokesman said it targeted Australians because ‘their skills and training closely match those in the UK’. Staff shortages have been blamed on a lack of training places and paramedics being ‘actively recruited’ to the NHS 111 service or as disability benefits assessors. Sarah O’Donoghue, of the union Unison, said pressure on existing staff was driving more to leave their jobs. Yesterday the Department of Health was in talks to avert a 12-hour strike by ambulance staff on Thursday. NHS patients in Wales are suffering lengthening waits to receive treatment, an official report warns today. Waiting time targets have not been met since September 2010 and performance has been getting worse, the Wales Audit Office found. By contrast, the NHS in England and Scotland is performing better against tougher targets. According to the report, one in ten patients in Wales had to wait more than 26 weeks for treatment – the target is one in 20 – and three per cent waited more than 36 weeks in March last year. It added that the causes for the longer waits ‘boil down to the inability of NHS Wales as a whole to sustainably match the supply of healthcare with demand for services’. A Welsh Government spokesman said: ‘We welcome the Wales Audit Office’s report, which recognises the good practice underway across Wales... [It] shows nine out of ten patients are waiting less than 26 weeks and the median wait is just under ten weeks.’","Ambulance trusts are being forced to recruit paramedics from abroad .

"A dog who vanished from his Texas yard last year has been returned home after turning up in a central Indiana city 1,100 miles away. Blue, a brown pit bull with a white spot on his chest, was reunited with JoeAnn Navarro of Galveston eight months after last seeing his owner. Mrs Navarro, 69, said her two pit bulls, Blue and Maggie, were stolen from her backyard in May, the Galveston Daily News reported. JoeAnn Navarro, 69, welcomed her dog Blue back to Galveston, Texas, on Saturday after eight months apart . Mrs Navarro thought she'd never see either dog again, but the Kokomo Humane Society called her a week ago to say a stranger had dropped her year-old Blue off at its shelter about 40 miles north of Indianapolis. A microchip implanted in Blue, who was just a few weeks old when he disappeared, wasn't registered, but the Indiana organization was able to find out that it had come from Texas and find Mrs Navarro. However the dog-lover didn't have enough money to make the journey up to the Hoosier State, which is 34 hours roundtrip. Three men, including two retired Galveston County sheriff's deputies Ricky Mitchell and Bobby Stanton, read about Mrs Navarro's story in their local newspaper and volunteered to drive to Indiana last week. Mrs Navarro hugs Ricky Mitchell, a retired sheriff's deputy, who volunteered to go get the dog from Indiana after hearing about that its owner did not have enough money . Year-old pit bull Blue went missing when he was just a few weeks old. His owner was tracked down with an implanted microchip after the dog was discovered at an Indiana shelter . The team, which included Mr Mitchell's brother Bill Russell, gathered Blue's leash and bed  and headed out last week. The men brought Blue back to Texas on Saturday after stopping in Kentucky because of a snowstorm. The grateful owner burst into tears when she was reunited with her long-lost canine, which jumped out of Mr Mitchell's pickup truck. Children with welcome back signs stood outside the Galveston Humane Society alongside Mrs Navarro, who arrived at the center two hours before her dog arrived. 'I don't have the words to describe what I am feeling,' she said. 'It is just a miracle. I prayed and prayed and I guess my prayers have been answered.' The journey from Galveston, Texas, to Kokomo, Indiana, is 1,100 miles, which amounts to a 34-hour round trip car ride . More than 150 people got in contact with the Galveston Daily News to try and help Mrs Navarro reunite with Blue . Mr Mitchell said he plans on staying in contact with the dog and its owner. More than 150 people got in contact with the Galveston Daily News to help bring back Mrs Navarro's dog after reading about it. The manager of the Galveston Island Humane Society said that $1,500 had been donated to the shelter after the incident.

"More than 1,000 students and staff members were evacuated from a high school in New Jersey this morning after a chemistry lab experiment went wrong. The blunder, which took place at Kingsway Regional High School around 7:40am, released potentially toxic fumes into the air and emergency services were called out to inspect the area. Twelve students and five faculty members who were in the chemistry lab at the time were taken to hospital for precautionary exams. The blunder, which took place at Kingsway Regional High School (pictured) around 7:40am, released potentially toxic fumes into the air and emergency services were called out to inspect the area . They had reportedly been conducting tests with lauric acid which can cause respiratory problems if inhaled. It can also cause eye and skin irritation. The substance was being heated to show changes in temperature and its believed a contaminant in a beaker created a bad reaction, triggering plumes of smoke. Everyone on site was escorted to the middle school building. Shortly after 9am students were given the go-ahead to return to classrooms and resume their schedule. The hospitalized patients were also released and are said to be doing 'fine'. The chemistry lab in question will remain closed as investigation and clean-up continues. Regardless of the incident, students had been scheduled for early release Monday due to the approaching snow storm.","The blunder took place at Kingsway Regional High School around 7:40am .

"As Aaron Hernandez's old New England Patriot teammates prepare for Sunday's Super Bowl, the former tight end is getting ready for his Massachusetts murder trial to finally start. A jury of 13 women and five men was seated by Bristol County Superior Court Judge Susan Garsh on Monday after more than two weeks of jury selection. Six of the 18 jurors will be randomly selected as alternates just before deliberations start. As Aaron Hernandez's old New England Patriot teammates prepare for Sunday's Super Bowl, the former tight end is getting ready for his Massachusetts murder trial to finally start on Thursday . As Aaron Hernandez's old New England Patriot teammates prepare for Sunday's Super Bowl, the former tight end is getting ready for his Massachusetts murder trial to finally start on Thursday . Hernandez is charged with killing Odin Lloyd of Boston in June 2013. Lloyd was dating the sister of Hernandez's fiancee. He has pleaded not guilty. The judge said because of the blizzard approaching the region, opening statements have been rescheduled for Thursday, though they could be postponed further because of the weather. On Monday afternoon, Garsh continued to screen additional potential jurors in case one of the 18 seated is unable to serve. Sunday's Super Bowl will be the Patriots' first appearance since 2012, when Hernandez caught a touchdown pass in Super Bowl XLVI. At the time he seemed to be a man with a bright future. At age 23 he had a Super Bowl appearance under his belt and a $40 million contract as a star tight end with the team. At 23 Hernandez had a Super Bowl appearance under his belt and a $40 million contract as a star tight end with the New England Patriots, but then he was arrested in June 2013 and charged with murder . Hernandez is charged with killing Odin Lloyd of Boston in June 2013. Lloyd was dating the sister of Hernandez's fiancee . He and his fiancee had started a family and were living in a mansion in the Boston suburbs with their 8-month-old daughter. At age 23 Hernandez had a Super Bowl appearance under his belt and a $40 million contract as a star tight end with the New England Patriots, but then he was arrested in June 2013 and charged with murder . But prosecutors at his trial will paint a different picture of him as a killer who orchestrated the shooting of semiprofessional football player Lloyd. He was arrested on 26 June 2013, just days after Lloyd's bullet-riddled body was found in an industrial park near his North Attleborough mansion. The Patriots cut him less than two hours after he was arrested. Hernandez, now 25, is also charged with killing two men in Boston in 2012 because he felt disrespected after one of them spilled a drink on him at a nightclub. He pleaded not guilty after being charged in those shootings in May, and the case has not yet gone to trial. Lloyd, 27, played for the Boston Bandits football team and was dating the sister of Shayanna Jenkins, Hernandez's fiancee. Prosecutors say he and Hernandez were friendly and had been at a nightclub together a couple of days before he was killed. Prosecutors have said Hernandez and two friends from his hometown of Bristol, Connecticut, picked up Lloyd at his home in Boston's Dorchester section around 2:30 a.m. on June 17, 2013. New England Patriots tight end Aaron Hernandez was arrested on 26 June 2013 and led out of his home in handcuffs and later charged in connection with the murder of Odin Lloyd . Those men, Carlos Ortiz and Ernest Wallace, have also pleaded not guilty to murder charges and will be tried separately. From Dorchester, prosecutors say the four men drove to North Attleborough in a rented Nissan Altima, stopping along the way to buy bubble gum at a gas station. An hour after he left his house, prosecutors say Lloyd was dead, shot multiple times by a .45-caliber Glock. They have not said who pulled the trigger, but say Hernandez orchestrated the killing. The murder weapon has never been found. New England Patriots tight end Aaron Hernandez was arrested on 26 June 2013 and led out of his home in handcuffs and later charged in connection with the murder of Odin Lloyd . Prosecutors have said toll booth, video surveillance, GPS and cellphone records clearly place Hernandez in the car with Lloyd at the time of his murder, and have said video from the security system inside Hernandez's own home shows him walking through his house with a gun minutes after the killing. Christopher Dearborn, a professor at Suffolk University Law School, says that while the Bristol County District Attorney's office has a lot of circumstantial evidence, its challenge is to offer a motive to jurors. Prosecutors have said a possible motive was that Hernandez may have showed Lloyd the spot where the 2012 shooting took place. But Bristol County Superior Court Judge Susan Garsh last month ruled they may not introduce anything having to do with the 2012 killing in the Lloyd murder trial. Aaron Hernandez #81 of the New England Patriots celebrates with his teammates after catching a 12 yard touchdown pass from Tom Brady during Super Bowl XLVI in 2012 . The lack of a clear motive is the biggest weakness in the prosecution's case, Dearborn said. 'You need to give a jury a reason why, or they're going to have pause,' Dearborn said. 'I don't think they have a motive that they can present in concrete fashion with witnesses that can support a motive.' Hernandez's legal team is likely to focus on the holes, Dearborn said. 'We don't have a weapon. We don't have a confession. We don't have eyewitnesses,' he said. Hernandez's team does not have to offer a defense or explanation, or even deliver an opening statement. But Dearborn said he expects to hear one. 'They will absolutely have to have their own narrative,' he said. 'That narrative will probably suggest alternatives.' Jenkins, Hernandez's fiancee has been charged with perjury for allegedly lying to a grand jury — including when she said she could not remember what she did with a box prosecutors believe she disposed of after getting what they called a coded message from Hernandez. She has pleaded not guilty. In the run-up to the trial, Jenkins was often seen in court, and the judge this month granted a request from Hernandez's legal team that she be allowed to attend the trial to support him even though she is listed as a potential prosecution witness. But two days before the trial began, the district attorney petitioned the judge to grant Jenkins immunity, which would compel her to testify. The court has not said yet whether it was granted. Jenkins has not been seen in the courtroom since.","Former Patriots tight end is getting ready for his Massachusetts murder trial to finally start on Thursday .

"Walter Powley, 85, died after suffering severe burns when he fell and became trapped between a wardrobe and a radiator . An 85-year-old grandfather-of-four died from severe burns after falling at his care home and becoming trapped between a wardrobe and a radiator. Walter Powley was unable to reach the emergency buzzer in his room after he became trapped against an unprotected radiator pipe for several minutes. Mr Powley suffered severe burns to his legs and died in hospital eight days later. His care home, Western Park View, in Leicester, was fined £100,000 with £35,000 costs after it admitted breaching health and safety rules. Mr Powley was only due to be at the care home for a couple of weeks until further arrangements could be made, and was admitted on the advice of an occupational therapist because of his risk of falling. His son Colin Powley said: 'We're still devastated not only by our dad's death but also how it came about. 'The fact he died from injuries sustained as a result of, in our view, inadequate care in a place where he was supposedly safer than at home is heart-breaking.' The widower was admitted to the home for respite care in May 2012, but Leicester Crown Court heard that four days later, on May 8, the grandfather fell in his room and became trapped. He was there for several minutes before being discovered by a carer at 7.30am, having suffered severe leg burns from an unprotected pipe and valve below a radiator as well as superficial burns to both legs from hot water leaking from the valve. Although the radiator was covered by protective safety insulation, the 70C pipe below it  was not. Tim Green, prosecuting for the Health and Safety Executive (HSE), said: 'The care home failed to insulate the pipe and valve. 'Three of the home's 50 other bedrooms also had similar exposed pipes and it could have been avoided had they assessed the foreseeable risk.' The care home admitted the failing. Walter Powley was unable to reach the emergency buzzer in his room after he became trapped against an unprotected radiator pipe at Western Park View care home (pictured), in Leicester, for several minutes . Recorder Roger Evans said: 'Walter Powley's family had every right to expect he was going to be cared for in a safe environment, which it wasn't. 'The exposed pipework was a risk and danger which should never have been allowed. 'I accept [the care home] had a good record for safety and care. 'The defendants were well aware of the 43 degree centigrade limit (the limit recommended in care homes).' Colin Powley added: 'My dad's stay at Western Park View was only to be for two weeks respite while we explored all the options for his future care. 'We had supported and cared for Dad daily and managed to keep him safe in his own home for six years following a stroke. 'Now we've lost valuable time with our dearly loved dad and his young grandchildren have lost the time to build their relationship and memories of him. The care home admitted its failing and was fined £100,000 at Leicester Crown Court (pictured) 'We sincerely hope the lessons learned with regard to exposed pipework and acceptable temperatures for hot surfaces in care homes will prevent other families having to experience what we have.' Speaking after the case, HSE Inspector Richenda Dixon said: 'Walter's death could have been prevented, had the hot pipes and valves been covered or boxed in. 'This was a foreseeable and a preventable fatal incident.' The care home issued a statement, saying: 'Western Park View Care Home and our staff were devastated by the tragic death of Walter Powley. 'We operate in a highly regulated industry and are inspected on a regular basis to make sure that we are providing the safest environment to those persons under our care. 'We are very sorry we did not recognise that a short section of exposed pipework underneath the wall hung radiator in the corner of Mr Powley's room presented a danger to him. 'We are grateful that the judge recognised the company's good safety record and that this was not a cost-cutting exercise, rather that this was a case in which the risk went unnoticed. This issue has now been addressed.'","Walter Powley fell and became trapped between a wardrobe and a radiator .

"Weathermen across the Northeast were declaring 'mea culpa' on Tuesday after terrifying predictions of 3-feet of snow  and hurricane-strength winds failed to materialize for much of the region. Tens of millions of people, from southern Pennsylvania to Maine, hunkered down for a storm that for most failed to live up to predictions that it would be one of the worst they'd ever seen. Forecasters originally said the storm could bring 1-3 feet of snow and punishing hurricane-force winds in New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania with authorities describing it as 'historic'. Scroll down for video . A homeless woman drags a sack of belongings on Wall Street during a light snowfall on Tuesday. The 20 inches of snow predicted for New York City failed to materialize . Historic storm, what historic storm? New England was still facing blizzard conditions on Tuesday but much of the Northeast which had been threatened with an unprecedented storm emerged relatively unscathed . The National Weather Service said Boston and Providence, Rhode Island, could get the most snow, about 2 feet. In places like Cape Cod and Plymouth, Massachusetts, more than two feet of snow had fallen in a blizzard that continued to pound the region on Tuesday afternoon. New York was threatened with predictions of 10-20 inches, Hartford, Connecticut, 1-2 feet, and Philadelphia and central New Jersey about 6 inches. But early Tuesday, they downgraded most of those numbers, saying New England would fare the worst -  but even then not as bad as expected. Some Eastern Pennsylvania weather forecasters threw up their hands and admitted on their Facebook page: 'We are throwing in the towel on this system.' The post continued: 'We blew the call, and everyone blew it - and amending or lowering your original call is not nailing it either. No one got this right, plain and simple. One New Jersey weatherman took to Twitter late on Monday night to admit that he had got the forecast wrong - and he wasn't alone . Another meteorologist posted a social media mea culpa late on Tuesday night as residents in the tri-state area stared out the window and wondered what happened to the 'historic' storm . New York Metro Weather service also held their hands up to a skewed prediction for New York City- but they hadn't missed the mark on the greater Northeast region where some places saw more than 2 feet of snow . 'So although we put countless hours of time and effort into this one, we failed. Yes we got and will get snow, but nowhere close to the epic amounts that up until today looked to be spot on. 'So this is our 'man-up' post. It wasn't hyped, it wasn't sensationalized. It was the right call from a physics and forecasting standpoint, but in the end, mother nature humbled us.' New Jersey meteorologist, Gary Szatkowski, also tweeted his apologies: 'My deepest apologies to many key decision makers and so many members of the general public. 'You made a lot of tough decisions expecting us to get it right, and we didn't. Once again, I'm sorry.' According to Accuweather, one of the biggest decisions in forecasting the weather is whether to trust the American or European model - and with winter storm Juno, they both predicted different outcomes. Occuweather tweeted: 'The Euro model, the most reliable of them all, has failed.Will the city see a foot of snow?Probably. But all of us have failed to an extent.' While NY Metro Weather added: 'Still, blame is on us as meteorologists - can't be placed anywhere else. It is a difficult day for us any time a forecast does not work out.' A stream of usually reliable meteorologists came out and tweeted their apologies for getting the forecast wrong - and the public were mostly gracious in their responses . Grand Central Station was mostly deserted on Tuesday lunchtime after travel bans over night on Monday clearly had a knock-on effect and kept most people at home . Although parts of the Northeast were only sideswiped by the so-called 'historic storm', Connecticut was battered by snow and high winds (pictured on Tuesday) A man walks in the cold weather along the snow-covered boardwalk on Tuesday morning in Atlantic City, New Jersey . The National Weather Service over the weekend had issued a blizzard warning for a 250-mile swath of the region, meaning heavy, blowing snow and potential whiteout conditions. Mayor de Blasio was defiant and unapologetic on Tuesday morning, saying that forecasts across the board has predicted 2 feet of snow, adding: 'We did what was necessary to keep everyone safe...This is a better safe than sorry scenario.' By midday, snow had slowed to a light flurry in New York City and the temperature hovered around 25F. Travel bans on the roads had been lifted for the majority of New York counties and New Jersey. Long Island, which was battered by the storm overnight, had travel restrictions lifted - even though some places, like the town of Islip, got around 20 inches of snow. The highest snowfalls in New York City were reported in eastern Queens and at LaGuardia Airport which saw almost 12 inches of snow - a decent amount, but far from a historic storm in the Big Apple. Mayor de Blasio has come in for criticism following precautions which basically shut down the city. On Monday, life abruptly stopped across the region as officials ordered workers to go home early, banned travel, closed bridges and tunnels, and assembled their biggest plowing crews. 'When you wake up in the morning, it is going to look like a blizzard,' said Massachusetts Governor Charlie Baker, echoing the concern of many government leaders. Light snow fell steadily early on Tuesday in midtown Manhattan as a few municipal trucks rumbled down empty streets. The city had an almost eerie, post 9/11 feel to it: No airplanes in the sky. An unexpected quiet. More than 7,700 flights in and out of the Northeast were canceled, and many of them may not take off again until Wednesday. Schools and businesses let out early. The shutdown in the entire New York public transport network meant that some commuters were forced to take alternative measures, such as this gentleman picture cross-country skiing in Central Park West . Charlie Glover leaves a two foot tall path as he uses a snow blower to dig himself out of the snow on Tuesday in Bedford, Massachusetts . Government offices closed. Shoppers stocking up on food jammed supermarkets and elbowed one another for what was left. Broadway stages went dark. Mayor Bill de Blasio urged New Yorkers to go home and stay there, adding: 'People have to make smart decisions from this point on.' In New Jersey, plows and salt spreaders remained at work on the roads on Monday night in Ocean County, one of the coastal areas that was expected to be among the hardest hit. There was a coating of snow on the roads but hardly any vehicles were traveling on them, as residents seemed content to stay indoors and monitor the storm in comfort. Most businesses in the area had gone dark, including some convenience stores and gas stations. On Wall Street, however, the New York Stock Exchange said it would operate normally on Tuesday as well. Coastal residents braced for a powerful storm surge and the possibility of damaging flooding and beach erosion, particularly in New Jersey and on Cape Cod in Massachusetts. Officials in New Jersey shore towns warned people to move their cars off the streets and away from the water. Utility companies across the region put additional crews on standby to deal with anticipated power outages.

"Mohammed Ashrafi is accused of posing as a spiritual figure in order to defraud followers . A man has been accused of masquerading as a faith healer to dupe victims out of £650,000. Mohammed Ashrafi, 50, allegedly posed as a devotee of Indian spiritual master Sai Baba and claimed he had powers to perform miracles, Leicester Crown Court was told. It is claimed he convinced 18 believers they were going to win the National Lottery and persuaded them to part with life savings. James House, prosecuting, told the jury: 'He's a clever and a sophisticated con artist and a fraudster. 'When they'd given him all they had, some borrowed from friends, even taking out loans. It exceeds £650,000. 'He assumed a persona, calling himself Kamal-Ji, claiming he could pray through Sai Baba and they would win the National or Euro lotteries. 'He demonstrated his abilities as a magician and would rub his hands together and produce prayer beads as if from thin air. 'This trick was repeated to many victims. It drew them in and they relied on it that he was connected to Sai Baba, like it was a miracle.' Ashrafi, from Leicester, denies 14 counts of fraud involving 18 people - between January and April 2014 - by falsely claiming that in return for payments his clientele would win the lottery. He also denies blackmailing a couple out of £50,000 last February. The prosecution allege that the blackmail involved Ashrafi drugging a woman, who became unconscious, before making a 'compromising' video and threatening to put it on the internet. The court heard Ashrafi convinced people they would win the lottery after pretending to have special powers . Mr House said: 'The defendant paid for tens of thousands of leaflets to be delivered, primarily within the Leicester Asian community.' The prosecution also allege that Ashrafi placed adverts on radio stations and in newspapers. Sai Baba of Shirdi was a Indian spiritual master who lived from 1838 to 1918 . The adverts for his alleged free-of-charge faith healing and astrology service highlighted personal problems he could assist with, such as marital difficulties, ill-health, business problems and childlessness, the court heard. Another alleged trick involved the defendant telling a devotee to make dough balls from rice flour, which Ashrafi then cooked on a portable stove. When one of the balls was cut in half there was a piece of silver foil with a Euro ticket inside, the court heard. Ashrafi  allegedly then put his hand to his ear, as if communicating with Sai Baba, to recite the exact numbers on the lottery ticket. Mr House said: 'A couple who witnessed this were stunned. They were convinced he was genuine and believed his claim that they were going to win the lottery.' When he disappeared from Leicester in March 2014, some alleged victims realised they had been conned, the prosecution said. The trial continues.

"Superstar Katy Perry's preacher dad - who once called her a 'devil child' - has revealed he will be in the Super Bowl crowd on Sunday to cheer her on. Firebrand evangelical minister Keith Hudson declared the I Kissed A Girl singer, best known for her racy costumes and outlandish performances, was in dire need of ‘healing’. However when Daily Mail Online caught up with him at his church headquarters in Orange County, California, Mr Hudson revealed his views have mellowed - and said he can't wait to watch her in the Super Bowl halftime show. He said: 'Oh no, I don't have a problem. She's gonna do some good ones - she's excited.' Scroll down for video . Heading to the SuperBowl: Fiery preacher Keith Hudson, the father of superstar Katy Perry, outside his Orange County church HQ on Monday . 'I don't watch football!' Keith Hudson says he doesn't follow football - but will be in the crowd to cheer on his daughter as she stars in the halftime show on Sunday . Katy, 30, will perform in the Pepsi Super Bowl XLIX Halftime Show, which is the most-watched musical event of the year. More than 115 million viewers in the U.S. watched last year's show, which is also will be broadcast worldwide. And the star's dad said he is looking forward to attending the clash between the Seattle Seahawks and the New England Patriots in Phoenix, Arizona. But he made it clear he's only going to Arizona for Katy - admitting: 'I don't watch football, I just hope somebody wins at the Super Bowl!' However, the preacher said that Katy may be toning things down for the NFL, as when asked if she would be her usual provocative self, he exclaimed 'No!' Katy, who will be joined by singer Lenny Kravitz on stage, has made it no secret that she can't wait for Sunday. She even posted a picture of her toes painted with footballs, with the message: 'Even my tippy toes are ready.' Mr Hudson, 67, a reformed 1960s hippy who has dedicated the last forty or so years to spreading the Gospel - was dressed in a black t-shirt and pants with a huge pendant around his neck, a Christian cross ring on his finger, two silver chains on his wrist and blue sneakers . And confirming he’s proud his daughter landed the coveted half-time show gig at America’s biggest sporting showdown taking place in Phoenix this year, he said: ‘I’m always proud. I’m a proud father.’ Football fan: Katy Perry is known for her racy and outlandish performances. She performed in a football uniform at the MTV Europe Awards in 2008 . Racy: Two semi-naked girls accompany Katy on stage - but it's believed she will tone things down for the NFL .

However, he refused to be drawn on his daughter’s rumored reconciliation with her ex-boyfriend John Mayer, saying: ‘No questions on John Mayer.’ But when asked if he knew if they were back together, he said: ‘I don't know, you know more than I know.’ It is all a far cry from Mr Hudson's previous sentiments towards his famous daughter. Two years ago, he reportedly told a congregation in Santa Fe Springs, California, of his disapproval of his daughter, saying: ‘They ask how can I preach if I produce a girl who sang about kissing another girl? ‘I was at a concert of Katy’s where there were 20,000. I’m watching this generation and they were going at it. It almost looked like church. I stood there and wept and kept on weeping and weeping. They’re loving and worshiping the wrong thing.’ Back together? Katy Pery and her on-off lover, singer John Mayer, were spotted together in Beverly Hills, California, earlier this month . NFL antics: Katy Perry joined Chris Fowler and Lee Corso at the Mississippi Rebels v Alabama Crimson Tide game in Mississippi in October . Mr Hudson is married to Katy’s mom Mary and the pair travel to different churches preaching the gospel and claiming to perform spiritual healings on churchgoers. The pair both led a bohemian counterculture life in the 1960s before turning to religion – with Mary even dating rock legend Jimi Hendrix. Katy told Katie Couric: ‘My mum went on a date with Jimi Hendrix. My dad was a part of Strawberry Fields Forever and hung out with Timothy Leary.

The gospel according to Hudson: Keith Hudson and his wife Mary are both preachers at their Orange County HQ . 'And they found God. They needed to find God. Not that they needed to find God, but God found them, really. 'My parents have stories. They probably have better stories than I do.’ However Mary has previously said she 'hates' I Kissed A Girl as it 'promotes homosexuality and its message is shameful and disgusting'.","Keith Hudson once said his daughter was in need of 'healing'

Mr and Mrs Obama spoke to a 12-year-old boy rescued from a button factory, an eight-year-old boy who lost a finger as a farm worker and activist Miss Jangid. Miss Jangid, who has advocated for clean drinking water in schools and works against child marriages, was given a warm hug by the First Lady when they met in New Delhi. The 14-year-old is a World's Children's Prize jury member and leader of the Child Parliament in her village in rural Rajasthan, a part of India plagued by poverty where child brides are not uncommon. In his speech following the meeting with Satyarthi and the young activists, the U.S. President highlighted the need for gender equality in modern society.

Important words: President Barack Obama addressed issues of gender equality and minorities in his speech at the Siri Fort Auditorium in Delhi . 'Every woman should be able to go about her day - to walk the street or ride the bus - and be safe and be treated with the respect and dignity that she deserves,' President Obama told the audience  at the Siri Fort Auditorium, a government-run event center in New Delhi. A horrific gang rape on a moving bus in the heart of New Delhi in 2012 sparked public protests, which prompted more stringent laws. But critics say more progress is needed and the President gave voice to their cause. 'Our nations are strongest when we uphold the equality of all our people and that includes our women,' he said. President Obama also praised his wife during his speech, noting that he is married to a strong woman who is not afraid to speak her mind. Since taking office in May, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has often talked about women's rights, urging Indians to treat sons and daughters equally. He recently launched an 'educate the daughter, save the daughter,' program to stem sex selective abortions that skews the gender ratio toward boys and to encourage parents to educate girls, who are often considered a burden. The President said that while he has had extraordinary opportunities, 'there were moments in my life where I've been treated differently because of the color of my skin.' As he touted the importance of religious tolerance, he noted the persistent false rumors that he is a Muslim, not a Christian. 'There have been times where my faith has at times been questioned by people who don't know me, or they've said that I adhere to a different religion, as if that were somehow a bad thing,' Obama said. Word: President Obama said nations are 'strongest when we uphold the equality of all our people' First couple: President  Obama walks from the stage with the First Lady after praising her in his speech . Meeting the fans: President  Obama greets people in the audience after his speech . Equality is enshrined in India's constitution, but religious minorities and women have experienced harassment and violence. India is largely Hindu, with almost 80 percent following the faith. At over 12 percent Muslims are India's largest minority, with Sikhs, Christians and Buddhists making up the rest. While religious groups largely coexist peacefully, the country has seen several flare ups of violence, primarily between Hindus and Muslims. Obama said no society is immune from man's darkest impulses, as he raised the 2012 shooting at a Sikh temple in Oak Creek, Wisconsin that killed six people. 'In that moment of shared grief, our two countries reaffirmed a basic truth, as we must again today, that every person has the right to practice their faith how they choose, or to practice no faith at all, and to do so free of persecution and fear and discrimination,' Obama said. Modi was denied was denied a visa to the U.S. in 2005, three years after religious riots killed more than 1,000 Muslims in the Indian state where he was the top elected official. He has denied any wrongdoing and India's top court says it found no evidence of Modi's involvement in the riots, but India's Muslims and Christians are wary of Modi's right wing Bharatiya Janata Party. Obama's speech was the closing to a three-day visit to celebrate India's Republic Day, the anniversary of India's democratic constitution taking force in 1950. He cut out Tuesday's plans for a visit to the Taj Mahal, India's famed white marble monument of love, to add a stop in Saudi Arabia on the way home to pay respects to the royal family following King Abdullah's death.","President and First Lady met Nobel Peace Prize winner in New Delhi .

"Police in Florida are on the hunt for a suspect in a hit-and-ran crash involving a pregnant woman who was left injured. Sheriff’s deputies in Holiday say Crystal Lynn Noordhuizen, 32, who is seven months pregnant, was struck by a car Monday afternoon. According to investigators, the driver of the vehicle has been identified as 33-year-old Justin Lee Colby, who is believed to be her half-brother. Scroll down for video . Hit and run: Police in Florida are searching for 33-year-old Justin Lee Colby (left), who is suspected of running over his pregnant sister, 32-year-old Crystal Lynn Noordhuizen (right) with his car . Deputies say Colby mowed down the woman, who is seven months pregnant, with his white 2006 Dodge Charger, which he then slammed into a pole . Deputies told the station WFLA Noordhuizen was walking east on Westwood Drive’s south shoulder at around 1pm when Colby 'traveled off the roadway' and hit her. After striking the mother-to-be, Colby crashed his white 2006 Dodge Charger into a pole. He then walked to his home located on the same street, hopped on a white motorcycle and took off from the scene. Crystal Noordhuizen was taken to a nearby hospital to be treated for minor injuries. As of Monday night, police have not apprehended Justin Colby, who has a long criminal history dating back to at least 2006. Tragedy averted: The 32-year-old was taken to a hospital with only minor injuries . The 33-year-old man has been arrested at least eight times over the past nine years on a wide variety of charges, including aggravated assault; domestic violence; sex battery of a minor; possession and sale of controlled substances, and multiple probation violations. According to her Facebook page, Miss Noordhuizen and her alleged attacker appears to be related: both the 32-year-old woman and Justin Colby list a man by the name Dave Colby as their father, suggesting that they are siblings. In 2007, then-25-year-old Justin Colby made headlines when he was arrested for repeatedly having sex with a 15-year-old girl and plying her with drugs. Five years later, the troubled Holiday man landed behind bars again following a violent family feud reminiscent of Monday's incident involving his pregnant sister. In April 2012, Tampa Bay Times reported that Colby was arrested for hitting his brother, Daniel Colby, with his car following a brawl during which the siblings hurled a variety of household items at one another, including cutlery, a toaster and a crowbar. Troubled past: In April 2012, Colby was arrested for hitting his brother, Daniel Colby, with his car following a brawl . According to a police report, then-27-year-old Daniel Colby told officers he thought his big brother just wanted to scare him by pretending to run him over with a car and was going to swerve at the last second. But Justin Colby did not stop the car to miss his brother, who suffered a broken knee after being thrown over the car's hood. At the time, Justin Colby denied striking his sibling on purpose and claimed that Daniel jumped onto the hood of his car.","Justin Colby, 33, is accused of striking  Crystal Lynn Noordhuizen, 32, with his car in Holiday, Florida .

"Virgin Galactic is to wholly take over building and testing its new SpaceShipTwo craft from the company that designed and built the first aircraft, which was destroyed in a fatal crash last year. Richard Branson's space tourism firm confirmed that work on the second spaceship is now being fully conducted by its Virgin owned sister company The Spaceship Company. Test flights of the rocket, which is about 90 per cent complete, will also be performed by Virgin Galactic pilots rather than those from its partner Scaled Composites. Scroll down for video . Virgin Galactic is pushing ahead to build a replacement for its first SpaceShipTwo, seen above attached to the White Knight Two carrier aircraft on its maiden flight in 2010, after the fatal crash in October last year . Two test pilots working for Scaled Composites were flying the first SpaceShipTwo rocket when it broke apart 10 miles above the Mojave Desert in October last year. One of the pilots, Michael Alsbury, 39, a father of two, was killed in the crash. The accident is thought to have strained the relationship between Scaled Composites and Virgin Galactic. Since the crash at least 24 passengers who had signed up for flights with Virgin Galactic are thought to have demanded refunds. The two companies have a long history together, first signing a deal in 2004 that led to engineers from Scaled Composites designing and building Virgin Galactic's first SpaceShipTwo rocket, designed to take paying passengers into space. However, last year's accident that led to the SpaceShipTwo rocket breaking up in midair just seconds after disembarking from its mothership aircraft, led to Virgin Galactic publicly emphasising that it was not in charge of the failed flight. A spokesman for Virgin Galactic said it would continue to work with Scaled Composites and that they would provide a supporting role while the second spaceship is built and tested. They insisted that the agreement between the companies had always been that Virgin would be responsible for the building and testing of the second spaceship. The company said: 'Our second spaceship is being built by our wholly-owned sister organization, The Spaceship Company (TSC), who along with Virgin Galactic, will be responsible for testing and operating the vehicle.' 'Our team is organizing the remaining build schedule of the spaceship to accommodate potential lessons from the ongoing NTSB investigation. 'We are committed to making any modifications or improvements that we feel are necessary to improve the safety of the vehicle.' Virgin Galactic has also hired Doug Shane, a former test pilot with Scaled Composites, to head its test flight team along with Mike Moses, the former Launch Integration Manager for Nasa's Space Shuttle program. It also has its own team of test pilots, including Dave Mackay, a former RAF test pilot who flew the Harrier jump jet. Virgin was always due to take over the testing and construction of the SpaceShipTwo, but only after the test flights were considered to be a success. Virgin has pushed forward with an aggressive construction schedule to finish building the second SpaceShipTwo rocket despite the ongoing investigation into the crash. Preliminary findings by the National Transportation Safety Board in the United States said that a video taken inside the cockpit showed co-pilot Michael Alsbury prematurely unlocking the spacecraft's moveable tail. Co-pilot Michael Alsbury was killed after the first SpaceShipTwo rocket broke apart on a test flight . His spaceship broke up at 50,000 feet, he had no oxygen, and was traveling at the speed of sound. Yet test pilot Peter Siebold, 43, survived with just a shoulder injury. Investigators have been trying to piece together how he was thrown free of the spacecraft as it disintegrated while his colleague Michael Alsbury was killed. Strapped into his seat, Siebold was flung out of the cockpit as SpaceShipTwo began to break apart. Despite the huge forces he would have been subjected to as he plunged, he managed to unbuckle himself from his seat. The temperatures at that altitude would have been at least -70 degrees C and the air would have been perilously thin. SpaceShipTwo pilots wear thin flight jumpsuits, offering little protection against the bitter cold of the upper atmosphere. It is thought he may have fallen for miles to get into warmer, thicker air before finally releasing himself from his seat. As he did, his parachute deployed automatically, allowing him to fall safely to the ground. SpaceShipTwo exploded in midair (above) during a test flight conducted by Scaled Composites last October . An investigation into the crash, which scattered debris across the Mojave Desert (above), is still ongoing . He did not move a second lever designed to move the tail, but it deployed anyway. This may have started a series of events that caused the rocket to break apart 100 miles north east of Los Angeles. It is still unclear whether aerodynamic forces or a malfunction caused the tail to move. The final conclusions of the investigation are not due to be published until later this year. However, in a statement on its website, Virgin Galactic said it was pushing ahead with the construction of its second SpaceShipTwo at a hanger in the Mohjave desert. It hopes to begin test flights later this year. Virgin Galactic also said that it will begin manufacturing its third SpaceShipTwo rocket this year. Virgin Galactic has promised to make  improvements on its second rocket, which it is currently constructing, using the  findings from the official investigation into the crash of the first SpaceShipTwo rocket (above) Virgin Galactic has emphasised that the failed SpaceShipTwo test flight, which broke apart above the Mojave Desert (above), was conducted by Scaled Composites and the company has now taken over test flights itself . SpaceShipTwo has been under development at Mojave Air and Spaceport in the desert northeast of Los Angeles. SpaceShipTwo is carried aloft by a specially designed mothership and then released before igniting its rocket for suborbital thrill ride into space and then a return to Earth as a glider. Ticket cost: The starting price for flights is $250,000 (£150,000) - the first ceremonial flight will be undertaken by Richard Branson and his family. Training: Passengers are required to go through a 'Pre-Flight Experience Programme', including three days of pre-flight preparing onsite at the spaceport to ensure passengers are physically and mentally fit to fly. Once aboard: SpaceShipTwo will carry six passengers and two pilots. Each passenger gets the same seating position with two large windows - one to the side and one overhead. The space ship is 60ft long with a 90inch diameter cabin allowing maximum room for the astronauts to float in zero gravity. Flight path: A climb to 50,000ft before the rocket engine ignites. Passengers become 'astronauts' when they reach the Karman line, the boundary of Earth's atmosphere, at which point SpaceShipTwo separates from its carrier aircraft, White Knight II. The spaceship will make a sub-orbital journey with approximately six minutes of weightlessness, with the entire flight lasting approximately 3.5 hours. The spaceship accelerates to approximately 3,000 mph - or nearly four times the speed of sound . Flight frequency: Initially one per week, eventually to have two flights per day. This graphic explains how passengers will be carried to 50,000ft before the rocket engine ignites and are then carried into space on a flight lasting 3.5 hours at speeds of nearly four times the speed of sound . Peter Siedbold, 43, and Michael Alsbury, who were flying SpaceShipTwo last year when it broke apart, both worked for Scaled Composites. Mr Siedbold was thrown from the plane still in his seat and managed to unbuckle himself as he plunged to Earth and his parachute deployed. According to the LA Times, Kevin Mickey, the president of Scaled Composites, confirmed that his company would no longer be involved in testing of virgin's SpaceShipTwo. SpaceShipTwo, seen above docked to its mothership aircraft in March 2010, was dubbed the VSS Enterprise . However, he said the company would still work as a consultant to Virgin Galactic. 'We will always consider these people our partner,' Mickey said. 'In any situation like that, emotions are high. Everybody needs to take time out to have the facts settle out.' Richard Branson’s plan to send paying passengers into space has attracted famous names who have purchased tickets, including Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie, Justin Bieber and his manager Scooter Braun, Lady Gaga, who plans to try and sing in space, Tom Hanks, and Ashton Kutcher, who was the 500th customer to purchase a ticket. Russell Brand also got a ticket for his birthday from ex-wife Katy Perry when the two were married. Perry bought a ticket as well so Brand would not have to go alone. Stephen Hawking and Kate Winslet are also set to fly, but got their seats for free.","Virgin Galactic confirms that it will construct and test new rocket itself .

"A pizza takeaway was shut for just three days after health inspectors found it was infested with hundreds of dead and alive cockroaches. Pizza Pan in Perry Barr, Birmingham, was ordered to shut after baby cockroaches and eggs and 20 of the insects were discovered ‘huddled together’ in a cupboard where pizza bases were kept. The takeaway, which also sells fried chicken and chips, was also found to have cockroaches behind a cool drinks chiller, under a microwave, and crawling on a wall. Found under work surface: Pizza Pan in Perry Barr, Birmingham, which also sold fried chicken and chips, was found to have cockroaches behind a cool drinks chiller, under a microwave, and crawling on a wall . Disgusting: The insects were also on work surfaces where pizza boxes were being stored, while dead ones were discovered in a storeroom washing up area . The insects were also on work surfaces where pizza boxes were being stored, while dead ones were discovered in a storeroom washing up area. Its owner Shaid Salim, 38, of Bordesley Green, Birmingham, has now been fined £900 and ordered to pay £2,000 costs after pleading guilty to one charge under the Food Hygiene Regulations. Magistrates told him it was a serious infestation which built up over time, but they took into account his lack of previous convictions and attempts to restore the business to a better level of hygiene. Julia Kettle, prosecuting for Birmingham City Council, told the city’s magistrates’ court that two environmental health officers made a routine visit in November 2013 to the takeaway. She said: ‘Officers then began inspecting the premises, starting in the kitchen, and immediately saw dead and live cockroaches on the floor.’ Miss Kettle said there was ready-to-eat salad on a work surface which raised ‘serious concerns’ of the food being contaminated, while there was also an area where dirt and grease had accumulated. Inspection: Two environmental health officers made a routine visit in November 2013 to the takeaway (above) Operating business for ten years: Owner Shaid Salim (pictured), 38, has now been fined £900 and ordered to pay £2,000 costs after pleading guilty to one charge under the Food Hygiene Regulations . An emergency closure order was issued by the council, but the business was allowed to open again after three days. Salim did not appear in court for a year, but this was still just inside the 12-month window within which cases can be brought, with his first hearing in November 2014, and his most recent one yesterday. Ghulam Sohail, defending, said Salim had been operating the business for ten years and it had previously been given a high hygiene rating. A significant amount of work had subsequently been done to prevent rodents or cockroaches getting into the takeaway, he said. Pizza Pan - which is open every day of the week from 4pm until after midnight - has an average rating of four stars from almost 650 reviews on takeaway website Just Eat. And its last Food Standards Agency rating in September 2014 was four out of five, which is 'good'. Responding to a query about why the takeaway was only shut for three days, a council spokesman told MailOnline: 'Where our environmental health officers find breaches of food hygiene regulations in any food business, they will work with that business to ensure any imminent risk to public health is removed and that it complies with regulations, so it can operate safely. 'The time this can take may vary, depending on the severity and extent of the issues identified when inspected, and how well the business works with the council to tackle these effectively, to achieve compliance and remove any risk to public health.'","Cockroaches and eggs  found 'huddled together' in pizza base cupboard .

"A bank adviser and her fiance stole £123,000 from a customer's account after they claimed fraudsters had threatened to reveal compromising photos in the run up to their wedding, a court heard. Anisyah Ali, 25, who was working at Halifax's North Finchley branch in north London, passed confidential details to fiance Salim Hussain, 29, and used the money to buy cars and jewellery. The Old Bailey heard that by the time customer Julian Masters spotted the transactions, £123,000 had been approved, while the bank had declined another £114,000. Aniysah Ali, pictured arriving at the Old Bailey, was working at a Halifax branch in north London when she allegedly used her powers as a personal banker to take the details of a customer and spend £123,000 . Ali was allegedly able to use her position as a personal banker to remove blocks on the account when the bank became suspicious of unusual spending activity. The couple changed his address and used his personal details to order a new debit card and PIN number and Ali quit her £16,500 job the day before she was arrested on 30 May 2012. She initially made no comment, but in a prepared statement later told police her husband-to-be had been threatened by a man known as Raza Shah and co-defendant, 28-year-old Zain Hussain. Prosecutor David Hughes told the court: 'She said prior to the offending her husband had been subjected to a campaign of harassment by way of threats to his mobile phone. 'She also stated that Shah threatened to reveal compromising photos of her to her family.' However, there is no evidence to back up her claims, the court heard, and Mr Hughes added that Shah, real name Alexander Saeed, was not standing trial after admitting fraud. Mr Hughes continued: 'It is the Crown's case that the role of Anisyah Ali is absolutely vital. She was a pivotal figure. The fraud could not have been carried out without the involvement of Ms Ali. 'She used and abused her position to access the account, obtain the necessary information to change the account owner's address to another one connected to the fraudsters and enabled the obtaining of the debit card used to carry out fraudulent transactions in a variety of locations on many occasions.' Co-defendant Zain Hussain, 28, denies fraud by false representation at the Old Bailey . The court heard how, on April 16, 2012, Ali accessed Mr Masters' account while in a private interview room at the bank. She changed the address on the account to one in Southall, west London, and ordered a new debit card and PIN number destined to fall into the hands of the fraudsters, the jury was told. The card was blocked on a number of occasions between April 21, and May 5, 2012 because of the unusual spending pattern on the account. Mr Hughes said: 'The information she was able to get from the account enabled those carrying out the fraud to telephone the bank to have the card reinstated.' Ali was arrested on 30 May 2012 at the bank's Wembley branch and receipts found in her handbag revealed cash deposits made to her Barclays account totaling more than £1,300. At her Southall home, which she shared with Salim Hussain, more receipts were recovered, including ones from a local jewellery shop. Checks at the shop revealed a forged utility bill had been used in conjunction with the debit card to make fraudulent purchases, the jury heard. Ali, Hussain and co-defendant Zain Hussain deny the claims while another defendant, Alexander Saeed, admitted fraud and is not standing trial at the Old Bailey (pictured), which continues . Other successful transactions included the purchase of two cars, for £7,950 and £6,900. Ali and Salim, both of Southall, and Zain Hussain, of Hounslow, west London, all deny fraud by false representation. Ali also denies fraud by abuse of position between 27 March 2012 and 30 May 2012. The trial continues. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Anisyah Ali, 25, was a personal banker at Halifax's North Finchley branch .

"Greece's new left-wing prime minister has declared war on the country’s all-inclusive resorts, which are visited by thousands of British families every year. All-you-can-eat buffets and unlimited drinks by the pool are under threat even though that sector of tourism brings in £1.5billion a year for the Greek economy. Alexis Tsipras, leader of the triumphant anti-austerity party Syriza, believes such deals ‘alienate tourists from the local economy’ by keeping them in resorts and away from small businesses. Scroll down for video . Victorious: 'Our priority above all will be to restore the country's lost dignity,' Syriza leader Alexis Tsipras, 40, told a rally of thousands of supporters . Jubilant: Syriza supporters celebrate victory in the Greek general election, in which the anti-austerity party triumphed over ruling conservatives . He has promised to curb the type of mass tourism that Greece has developed in the last few decades. Deals to sell public land to mega-resort developers could be banned and VAT rules are likely to be changed to hit existing holiday developments with higher taxes. Mr Tsipras said: ‘We do not want to continue the current saturated model of intensive exploitation of tourism.’ The new regime says it does not support an outright ban, but wants to encourage a move away from the all-inclusive resorts back to the traditional holiday model where visitors use local bars, restaurants and attractions. Michalis Kritsotakis, the Syriza MP responsible for the party’s tourism policy, told The New York Times: ‘For the all-inclusive, our view, as well as that of the tourism industry, is that it’s not the best thing.’ There are hundreds of all-inclusive hotels on the Greek islands and on the mainland in resorts such as Agios Nikolaos in Crete and Kardamena in Kos. Deals: Holiday-makers can go all-inclusive at the Aquis Arina Sand in Crete, but prices could become unaffordable . They are popular with families on a budget who know that once they have paid, they will not face extra bills for meals, drinks and entertainment. But they are a disaster for local traders and restaurant owners because holidaymakers tend to stay behind the fences of the resorts. British tour operators have long-standing contracts with all-inclusive resorts, meaning any changes to the tax regime in Greece would be unlikely to affect visitors this year. Thomas Cook said: ‘The change in government has no impact on our operations in Greece. As a tour operator, we are there to support our customers, who can be confident they can book their holidays to Greece with us without any concern.’ Tourist chiefs in both Britain and Greece oppose any tax changes that will put up the cost of visiting the country’s resorts. All inclusive: Many families choose the all-in option to save money at locations including Blue Domes Exclusive Resort & Spa is on the Greek island Kos . Heads together: New PM Alexis Tsipras, left, with his new finance minister Yanis Varoufakis . By JASON GROVES, DEPUTY POLITICAL EDITOR FOR THE DAILY MAIL . A Marxist economist who has described austerity as ‘fiscal waterboarding’ was last night appointed as Greece’s finance minister. Yanis Varoufakis has branded the EU a ‘fundamentally anti-democratic, irrational cartel that has put Europe’s peoples on a path to misanthropy, conflict and permanent recession’. His appointment by far-left prime minister Alexis Tsipras will be seen as a signal that the new government will not back down over its demands to slash the country’s crippling debt repayments. Mr Varoufakis, an academic who has held teaching positions in Britain, says repayment of Greece’s £185billion international bailout should be linked to growth. In practice, this would mean nothing is repaid until the economy recovers. The left-wing Syriza party won a shock general election victory on Sunday after pledging to renegotiate the bailout deal and write off more than of half the debt. Mr Tsipras has formed a coalition with the anti-austerity party Independent Greeks. EU leaders have reacted with alarm to Syriza’s victory, with Germany warning Greece it must pay its debts. David Cameron warned the result would ‘increase economic uncertainty across Europe’. Vincenzo Scarpetta, of the think-tank Open Europe, said of Syriza: ‘Proving that their theories can be applied to the current political and economic reality will be a tough test.’ Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras believes such all-inclusive deals 'alienate tourists from the local economy' by keeping them behind resort gates and away from businesses and attractions . The Association of British Travel Agents said this would drive holidaymakers to other Mediterranean countries. A spokesman said: ‘The Greek government will have to consider the impact of any restrictions. ‘All-inclusive holidays continue to grow in popularity, particularly amongst the family market. The Greeks should consider that they might risk losing this slice of the holiday market to other countries such as Turkey and Egypt. 'Even though all-inclusives can be seen as a controversial option, there are pros and cons and many all-inclusives are a vital source of employment for local people, both directly and indirectly.’ Any changes made by the new Government will not affect the cost of package holidays that are currently being advertised by British tour operators as the contracts and prices have already been agreed. 'Suicide': Andreas Andreadis, the president of the Greek Tourism Confederation, said that increasing taxes on accommodation at places like SENTIDO Port Royal Villas & Spa in Rhodes would be like ‘committing suicide’ for Greece . Aquis Arina Sand in Crete is a popular location for holiday-makers, but will it still be affordable if taxes are increased . Andreas Andreadis, the president of the Greek Tourism Confederation, said that increasing taxes on tourist accommodation would be like ‘committing suicide’ for Greece. Last year, all-inclusive deals accounted for about £1.5billion of the Greek travel industry’s projected £12billion in revenue. The Greek National Tourism Organisation said tour operators were hoping the new government acts responsibly. UK director Christina Kalogera said: ‘Everyone is acutely aware of the important role tourism plays in the Greek economy and all Greek governments have always approached tourism policies with respect, which is what we expect the new Government to do once it has formed.’ Danai Badogianni, a spokesman for the new government, said: ‘The new minister for tourism will be announced today and he or she will explain our plans for all-inclusive package holidays in the coming days.’ Right behind her man: Tsipras, followed by his partner Peristera (Betty) Batziana, greets his  supporters outside Syriza's headquarters after his Syriza party's win in Sunday's general election . He prefers motorbikes to limousines, refuses to ever wear a tie and lives in a block of flats in one of the most densely populated areas of Greece. Incoming Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras is regarded as a true man of the people, a world away from Greece's political elite which has been characterised by corruption. With the help of his youthful good looks and down-to-earth nature (he happily takes out the rubbish), he has swept to power on a promise to smash the EU's grip on the country's finances. Breaking the stereotype of Greek politics, Mr Tsipras is known for his relaxed attitude: travelling around Athens on motorbikes and preferring open-necked shirts to a suit and tie. He lives with his partner, Betty Batziana, an electrical and computer engineer, with their two boys - Phoebus and Orpheus - in an apartment block in Kypseli, a modest, working-class area of Athens. Their youngest son's middle name is Ernesto – a tribute to Che Guevara, one of Mr Tsipras's idols. Tsipras had never been that interested in politics, instead throwing his energy into sport at a young age until he was sidelined with a knee injury. By his side: Ms Batziana convinced Mr Tsipras to join the Communist Youth of Greece in 1990 after they had met three years earlier at high school in Athens . Humble: The ramshackle block of flats where Tsipras with his partner, Betty Batziana, an electrical and computer engineer, live with their two children in one of the most densely populated areas of Athens . But after meeting Ms Batziana, something of a firebrand student, in 1987 when they were at high school together in Athens, she convinced him to join the Communist Youth of Greece in 1990. After training as an engineer, he eventually went into politics full-time. He was a member of the youth wing of the Greek Communist Party, the KKE, rising to prominence as candidate for the mayor of Athens in 2006. Tsipras became leader of Syriza in 2008 at the age of 34 at the height of Greece's economic crisis. Syriza was formed in 2004 as a coalition of moderate Communists, Trotskyists, ecologists and other leftist groups, but has occasionally found it difficult to present a united front. He has also become the undisputed star of the radical European left, standing against Jean-Claude Juncker in May's election for European Commission president. A year later, the pair found themselves at the centre of student protests against unpopular education reforms. Tsipras spearheaded sit-in demonstrations at their school that saw students living and sleeping in the building for weeks. Ms Batzianas was right by his side then - and still is now - with many seeing her as the driving force behind her partner's leadership.

"Target practice: This image was apparently used by Russian Special Forces as a target on a rifle range . Russian Special Forces used a photograph of Alexander Litvinenko as target practice during firearms training, the public inquiry into the spy's death heard yesterday. A picture of Mr Litvinenko's face was apparently riddled with bullet holes after being shot on a rifle range. Thousands of people in Britain were put in grave danger when assassins used a radioactive chemical to launch a ‘miniature nuclear attack’ on the dissident Russian, the inquiry was told. Respected judge Sir Robert Owen said the highly deadly toxin fed to the former KGB spy could have been used to ‘kill large numbers of people or spread general panic and hysteria among the public’. On the opening day of the inquiry into his death, the Royal Courts of Justice heard radioactive traces were found in ‘large numbers of places’ after two Russian hitmen laced Mr Litvinenko’s tea with a lethal dose polonium-210 at a London hotel. Biochemical experts found a teapot at the Pine Bar in the Millennium Hotel in Mayfair with readings for polonium-210 which were off the charts. Aim: This video shows how Special Forces used a series of photographs while conducting firearms training . Killed: Alexander Litvinenko, pictured in hospital in November 2006, died from radiation poisoning . Family: Marina Litvinenko pictured outside the hearing with her son Anatoly on the inquiry's first day . History: Alexander Litvinenko pictured with his wife Marina (left) and son Anatoly in London in 2000 . A public health alert was quickly issued after traces of the toxin – worth ‘tens of millions of dollars’ – were found in offices, homes, hotels and on planes across the capital and beyond. A lethal dose of the highly radioactive chemical is 50 nanograms – one billionth of a gram – which means just one gram would be potentially enough to kill 100 million people. Robin Tam QC, counsel to the public inquiry, said: ‘Many thousands of members of the public, including British residents and visitors from overseas, might have been at risk from radioactivity.’ Sir Robert described the killing as ‘a miniature nuclear attack on the streets of London’. After his death, Mr Litvinenko’s body had to be placed in a lead-lined coffin to prevent radiation from seeping out of his grave in Highgate cemetery in north London. Hearing: A public inquiry chaired by Sir Robert Owen, pictured, has started at the Royal Courts of Justice . Evidence: Robin Tam QC, pictured, said that Litvinenko's poisoning had sparked a massive health alert . Widow: Marina Litvinenko has been seeking justice for her husband's death for more than eight years . Accusation: Ben Emmerson QC, for Marina Litvinenko, called Vladimir Putin's Russia a 'mafia state' Part of the evidence at the inquiry into Alexander Litvinenko’s assassination will be heard in secret. Some witnesses will give evidence from behind a screen while others will be given complete secrecy to protect their links to the security services. And part of Judge Sir Robert Owen’s final report at the end of the multimillion-pound public inquiry ‘will have to remain secret’ to protect the sensitive evidence. Even Mr Litvinenko’s wife Marina will not be allowed to see the secret parts of the judge’s report. On the first day of the hearing yesterday, the court heard that the spy was being paid by the British security services in return for information on the Russian mafia. But the Home Office has always said it can ‘neither confirm nor deny’ that Mr Litvinenko was employed by MI5, MI6 or GCHQ. Neil Garnham QC, representing the Home Office, told the court that this policy would continue. He said: ‘There will be allegations that individuals were agents for those organisations or worked for them. The work of those agencies requires secrecy and there is a need to preserve that.’ However Sir Robert said that if evidence emerged which suggested British agents could have prevented his death, he would consider allowing it to be heard during the inquiry. The fatal attack in November 2006 was the second time that assassins had tried to kill him in the UK using polonium-210, Mr Tam also revealed. Weeks earlier, the spy recalled feeling unwell around the time of a meeting at a security company in mid-October and told of ‘vomiting on one occasion about two or three weeks before being hospitalised’. ‘Hair samples indicate Mr Litvinenko may well have been poisoned twice and the first occasion being much less severe than the second,’ Mr Tam said. The court heard how the 43-year-old was poisoned by former KGB bodyguard Andrei Lugovoi and Dmitri Kovtun for his public opposition to Vladimir Putin. After drinking the poisoned tea at the hotel, he went home on a bus in London and soon started to feel unwell. He spent 23 days in hospital in agonising pain as his strength left him and his organs began to fail. His final few days were spent in isolation in University College Hospital. It was then the haunting photo of him wearing a green hospital gown, his hair having fallen out through radiation poisoning, was taken. Meeting: Mr Litvinenko was apparently poisoned at the Millennium Hotel in Mayfair, pictured . Couple: The spy, left, fled to Britain with his wife Marina, right, after becoming an opponent of Vladimir Putin . Chairman: Sir Robert's inquiry comes more than eight years after Litvinenko's death . Ben Emmerson QC, representing the Litvinenko family, said: ‘The murder was an act of unspeakable barbarism that inflicted on Alexander Litvinenko the most painful and lingering death imaginable. ‘Mr Litvinenko came to realise he was bound to die, and that he had been the victim of a political assassination by the Russian state.’ Medical experts only established the precise nature of the rare poison that was killing him two days before his death. They initially thought he had been given a dose of thallium. However, he was given such a huge dose of polonium-210 experts believe he could not have been saved even with a prompt diagnosis. While alpha radiation emitted by polonium cannot pass through skin, when ingested it will fatally damage internal organs – known as acute radiation syndrome. Polonium is an exceptionally rare element, with only around 100g produced every year. Mr Emmerson told the court the quantity given to Mr Litvinenko was worth ‘tens of millions of dollars’. He added: ‘It is, we say, unlikely in the extreme any private individual or purely criminal enterprise would choose such a costly method of assassination. ‘For the Russian state, however, which produces polonium-210 itself, the costs of the assassination would not be prohibitive.’ Lugovoi and Kovtun brought the chemical to the UK on flights from Russia to London in October, he said. The multi-million inquiry into Mr Litvinenko’s death will hear from some 70 witnesses and is expected to last ten weeks. Sir Robert, its chairman, said sensitive evidence had established there is a ‘prima facie case’ as to the culpability of the Russian state’s involvement. The hearing continues. Suspects: Dmitry Kovtun, left, and Andrei Lugovoi, right, have been accused of killing Litvinenko . Speaking out: Mr Litvinenko, right, at a 1998 press conference in which he and secret service colleagues publicly denounced their boss Vladimir Putin . Vladimir Putin was accused of being a ‘common criminal dressed up as a head of state’ by the barrister representing Alexander Litvinenko’s family. Ben Emmerson QC said the dissident became a ‘marked man’ after he attempted to expose a plot by the Russian intelligence service – the FSB – to kill billionaire Boris Berezovsky in 1998. He further ‘antagonised’ his former FSB boss Putin by writing two books, and was killed on his direct orders, Mr Emmerson claimed. The first of Mr Litvinenko’s publications alleged the agency bombed apartment blocks which were then blamed on Chechen rebels to trigger a conflict, while a second implicated the FSB in Russian mafia operations. The dissident became a 'marked man' after antangonising his former boss Putin (pictured), Mr Litvinenko's lawyer claimed . Mr Litvinenko’s claims did ‘considerable damage’ to the FSB’s reputation – after the initial book ‘Blowing Up Russia’ was published. The dissident also criticised Putin’s regime on TV and elsewhere in public, including blaming the state for the murder of Russian journalist Anna Politkovskaya. And at the time of his death, Mr Litvinenko – who had defected and was working for MI6 – was due to give evidence in a Spanish trial which could have exposed links between Putin and organised crime, Mr Emmerson said. A day after Mr Litvinenko died in 2006, one politician told a debate in the Russian Duma: ‘The traitor received the punishment he deserved.’ Mr Emmerson said: ‘He had broken the culture of silence about the inner workings of the FSB. Experts on the Russian state have suggested that he was a marked man from that moment onwards.’ Mr Emmerson, representing Mr Litvinenko’s wife Marina and son Anatoly, said a plan was hatched at the highest level to ‘punish him lethally for breaking ranks’. ‘It was really only a question of how long it would take and what means would eventually be devised to deliver the fatal blow,’ Mr Emmerson said, adding: ‘Russian security services could not have carried out the assassination without Mr Putin’s direct approval, given Mr Putin’s known attention to detail in such matters. ‘We say that when all the open and closed evidence is considered together Mr Litvinenko’s dying declaration will be borne out as true – the trail of polonium leads not only from London to Moscow but directly to the door of Mr Putin’s office – and that Vladimir Putin should be unmasked by this inquiry as nothing more or less than a common criminal dressed up as a head of state.’ The inquiry was read transcripts of interviews given by Mr Litvinenko to police on his deathbed, in which he attacked members of the G8 group of industrialised nations, including Tony Blair, for legitimising the Putin regime. He also blamed Putin for the polonium attack, telling police: ‘The order could only have been given by one person – the President of the Russian Federation, Vladimir Putin.’ Mr Emmerson said: ‘Putin was a ruthless and deadly enemy.’","Public inquiry into the death of Litvinenko, 43, opened yesterday in London .

"An 80-year-old Long Beach man has not been charged for killing a burglar who falsely claimed she was pregnant and asked him not to shoot as she fled. The killing was justified, the Los Angeles County district attorney’s office announced after deciding not to charge Thomas Greer, who shot Andrea Miller on July 22 of last year. Mr Greer shot Miller, 28, twice as she tried to flee from his home after she and accomplice Gus Adams assaulted and robbed him, a prosecutor asserted in a December 5 report that was disclosed Monday. Mr Greer said that Miller claimed she was pregnant and asked him not to open fire.

Thomas Greer shot Andrea Miller (left), 28, twice as she tried to flee from his home on July 22 after she and accomplice Gus Adams (right), 26, assaulted and robbed him, a prosecutor said in a December 5 report that was disclosed on Monday . An autopsy later found that Andrea Miller, 28, was not pregnant, said coroner's spokesman Ed Winter. ‘Thomas Greer is presumed to have held a reasonable fear of imminent peril of death or great bodily injury,’ according to the report signed by Deputy District Attorney Janet Moore. ‘Greer exercised his legal and legitimate right of self-defense when he shot and killed Andrea Miller.’ Mr Greer told told NBC Los Angeles in July: 'I walked in on them and they downed me, they jumped on me in the hallway. 'The lady didn't run as fast as the man so I shot her in the back twice. She's dead.. but he got away. She says ""don't shoot me, I'm pregnant, I'm gonna have a baby"" and I shot her anyway. 'I shot her so that's going to leave a message on his mind for the rest of his life.' Californians can use deadly force to protect themselves inside their homes if they feel they are in imminent danger. Mr Greer, who had been burglarized at least twice in the past, returned home from work at about 9pm and found Miller and Adams, 26, trying to crack open a safe, the report said. The two lied and said they were police officers but then turned violent and broke his collarbone, according to the report. They eventually returned to trying to open the safe, the report said. Mr Greer couldn't leave his house because his front gate was padlocked and a woman with a small child was demanding that he let her in, the report said . Mr Greer couldn't leave his house because his front gate was padlocked and a woman with a small child was demanding that he let her in, the report said. He correctly assumed the woman, who turned out to be Adams' mother, was an accomplice, the report said. He got a small-caliber handgun from his bedroom and returned to the office area, where the two had managed to pry open the safe and get $5,000. They attacked him again until they saw he was armed and then fled, the report said. Mr Greer shot three times, striking Miller in the left side of the chest and in the right knee. She fell, got up and then fell in the alley outside, the report said. Her accomplice, Adams, ran to a car where his mother, Ruby Adams, was waiting and they drove away, the report said. Adams has pleaded not guilty to murder, burglary and robbery charges. He's charged with murder under the theory that he committed a felony that led to Miller's death.

"In your social circles, there will likely be friends you love spending time with, those who calm you down, and others that you know are a bad influence. And now an app can reveal exactly how these different people make you feel, including which friends you should cut out of your life for good. Called pplkpr, pronounced 'people keeper', it syncs with a heart rate monitor to track and log subtle changes in emotional state when you’re around these people. Scroll down for video . The pplkpr app (right) syncs with a Bluetooth heart rate monitor (left) to track emotions. When the monitor spots a change in heart rate, the app alerts the user. It asks the wearer to explain how they're feeling and who they're with, and over time, an algorithm learns the difference between the varying heart rates . And in doing so, it can even tell you which friends could be damaging your health. The free iOS app was created by Brooklyn-based artists Kyle McDonald and Lauren McCarthy, and was recently tested on a group of students at Carnegie Mellon University. Pplkpr pairs up with any Bluetooth-enabled heart rate monitor, although the students were given Mio devices during the test. From this list, the free iOS app ranks friendships based on different emotions (left). The app can then reveal which friends should be avoided during times of stress, it can block people who make the wearer anxious (right), or send text messages to people who make the wearer happy or calm . Using GPS, the app also notifies wearers when they change locations, to ask if they’ve just left, or are about to meet someone. The measurements are based on a metric called ‘heart rate variability’ (example pictured), where subtle changes in heart rhythm signal changes in an emotional state. This is fed into an algorithm . Called pplkpr, or People Keeper, it syncs with a heart rate monitor to track subtle changes in emotional state. Pplkpr notifies the wearer when it detects heightened emotion, and asks them to report how they’re feeling. Using GPS, it also notifies them when they change locations, to ask if they’ve just left, or are about to meet someone. The measurements are based on a metric called ‘heart rate variability’, where subtle changes in heart rhythm signal changes in an emotional state. Pplkpr knows when the wearer is experiencing a strong emotion, but lets them decide what that emotion is. Once established, pplkpr can write text messages, invite people to hang out, or block or delete contacts. All of these actions are shown on the home screen before they take place. It tracks and logs changes in heart rate and, when it notices a shift, asks the user to explain how they’re feeling, where they are and who they’re with. Over time, an algorithm built into the app can then learn which emotions the subtle changes in heart rate relate to. From this list, the app tracks which people make the wearer happy, who calms them down, and the people who cause the most fear or stress. This has a number of benefits, according to the developers. It can reveal which friends should be avoided during times of stress, for example. It can also block or unfriend people who make the wearer anxious or bored, or will message those who make them happy, or calm. ‘Pplkpr uses GPS and a heart rate wristband to keep track of when you're coming and going, and when you're feeling emotional,’ said the developers. ‘[It] implements a complex metric called “heart rate variability"" that uses subtle changes in heart rhythm to determine your emotional state. 'This data is correlated with the people you interact with to determine who should be auto-scheduled into your life and who should be removed.’ Ms McCarthy and Mr McDonald came up with the app to explore quantified living in relationships, and how people interact. And for people who don’t have a heart rate monitor, the app also lets them add manual emotional readings.","The pplkpr app syncs with a Bluetooth heart rate monitor to track emotions .

On Tuesday, Ms Stapleton flatly rejected an application by Elomar's latest lawyer, Muhammad Tehseldar, to have her case adjourned for a further three weeks. Citing the fact it had been before the same court for mention seven times since Elomar's arrest by counter terrorism police in May last year, Ms Stapleton described any further delay as 'unacceptable'.

Enough is enough: Sydney magistrate Lisa Stapleton has ordered Fatima Elomar (pictured) to appear at the Downing Centre court in central Sydney next week on terrorism charges, saying any further legal delays were 'unacceptable' Be ready: Fatima Elomar (pictured, getting into her  black Jeep Patriot following her last court appearance last November) has had her case up for mention seven times, but a magistrate has now demanded that the Brisbane mother face an arraignment or committal hearing . Poster boy: Ms Elomar's husband, Mohamed Elomar (pictured allegedly holding the severed heads of Syrian government soldiers) has become one of the Australian 'poster boys' for the extremist group ISIS since he travelled to war-torn Syria last year . New lawyer: Fatima Elomar (pictured at Goulburn Street parking station in central Sydney with her previous lawyer, Zali Burrows) has now appointed solicitor Muhammad Tehseldar, but his application to further postpone her case was rejected by magistrate Lisa Stapleton . Elomar, who is the mother of Sydney ISIS recruit Mohamed Elomar's four children, was arrested trying to board an international flight earlier this year to allegedly join husband Mohamed in Syria. She was allegedly carrying cash and camouflage clothing. Joint counter terrorism detectives arrested and charged Elomar with preparing for incursions into a foreign state with the intention of engaging in hostile activities. She has since appeared before a number of Sydney magistrates and last appealed to Magistrate Teresa O'Sullivan in November not to have to appear personally in January because she had a baby to look after. The accused, whose face has been uncovered during her brief court hearings, has always donned a a full-face niqab when leaving the court complex for the street. During one court appearance, for which she brought along her four children, the family group all left court draped in cloths and blankets.

High court bid: Fatima Elomar (above) with her former lawyer, Zali Burrows, leaving a central Sydney court after she briefly appeared on foreign incursion charges may still lodge an appeal against the Federal Government laying terrorism charges, saying the matters are unconstitutional . Ms Elomar has maintained since her arrest that she was travelling to Malaysia on holiday with her with her two young sons, daughter and baby. In the ensuing months last year, her husband Mohamed Elomar  became one of ISIS's 'poster' Aussie terrorists, posing in the besieged Syrian town of al Raqqa with a pair of severed heads and posting the photos on social media. Through her lawyer, Ms Elomar has said she is a ‘devoted mother’ of her four children and described the charges against her as ‘serious and over-zealous’. Ms Elomar (above, leaving the Downing Centre last year) appears in court with her face bare before covering up when she emerges onto the street . In a statement released following her arrest last year, Ms Elomar said her children had suffered enough from not being able to visit Malaysia for the holiday, and by being questioned by detectives. 'The ordeal of being interviewed without their mother, being unable to return home to their friends and school, having to adjust to a new way of life of reporting in to the police station with mum, and the task of trying to make new friends at a new school in a new state,’ Ms Elomar said in the statement. Ms Elomar's husband, Mohamed, is the nephew of convicted terrorist Mohamed Elomar, who plotted with four other men in 2005 to bomb targets in a bid to force Australia's government to change its policy on Middle East conflicts. Mohamed Elomar Snr is  still wielding significant influence over would-be Australian jihadis, despite the fact he is being held in Australia's Supermax jail in Goulburn, NSW, the Australian reports. Mr Elomar is believed to have flown to Syria in 2013 with Khaled Sharrouf, a convicted terrorist, who fled the country on his brother's passport. Mr Sharrouf has also posted photographs of himself and his children allegedly from Syria on social media, with one of his sons posing with a severed head. Ms Elomar said last year through Ms Burrows that her arrest highlighted the pitfalls for travellers packing camouflage gear as a fashion item. 'At the end of the day this is an example of one must be careful what you pack to travel, let it be a travel warning to leave the camouflage pants at home and best check with Smart Traveller as to what the acceptable fashion is,’ she said.

"Thirteen-year-old Suhayb Hassan died after being shot in the chest . A teenage boys' game of 'cops and robbers' turned tragic when a 15-year-old killed his younger brother with their dad's pistol. The older boy unintentionally shot his 13-year-old brother Suhayb Hassan after they discovered their father's gun at their Minnesota home, police said Monday. Police and paramedics arrived at the home in Eagan, south of St. Paul, on Sunday morning after the 15-year-old reported his younger brother was unresponsive and bleeding. The older boy originally told dispatchers his brother had fallen and stabbed himself while running with a knife. But when police arrived, the older boy told the officers he had accidentally shot his brother. 'I believe at the time he was very scared because he knew he wasn’t supposed to be playing with the firearm,' Detective Desiree Schroepfer said. 'And he was concerned that he was going to get in trouble for that.' Police said they do not anticipate any arrests in the case. The boys were home alone with their 11-year-old sister when they found an unloaded 9 mm pistol belonging to their father. A magazine with cartridges for the gun was nearby, police said, though they refused to discuss specifics about the weapon's storage. At some point, the firearm was loaded, then thought to be unloaded while the boys chased each other as they played 'cops and robbers,' investigators said. Two brothers were playing in their Eagan, Minnesota, home when the older sibling accidentally shot 13-year-old Suhayb Hassan with their father's gun . Police said the 15-year-old fired one round that struck Suhayb, an eighth grader at nearby Blackhawk Middle School, in the chest, the Minneapolis Star Tribune reported. The boy died at the scene despite attempts by paramedics to save his life. The 11-year-old sister did not witness the shooting and was not hurt, police said. While police said the shooting 'appears to be a horrible accident,' the results of their investigation will be presented to the Dakota County Attorney's Office for review. The 13-year-old's middle school notified students of the death on Monday morning and said that it would provide extra counsellors for students. The death marks the second tragedy in a year for Blackhawk Middle School after fourteen-year-old Patrick Schoonover, also an eighth grader, died in November after collapsing during a hockey tournament. 'Two deaths, two months, hundreds of broken hearts, #RIPSuhayb, #RIPPatrick,' Twitter user Josalyn Dehncke wrote. The Centers for Disease Control predicted that guns would kill more Americans than automobile accidents in 2015.

"The drug seeks out and 'silences' compounds . Doctors are using a type of arthritis drug to treat sciatica - the pain associated with a slipped disc. The drug seeks out and 'silences' compounds involved in inflammation - and early trials show that it can banish pain completely. Sciatica is caused by irritation and inflammation of the sciatic nerve, the longest nerve in the body, which runs from the back of the pelvis, through the buttocks, and down both legs to the feet. Sciatica is usually described as a sharp, shooting or burning pain, which radiates down the back towards the foot or ankle. Most attacks occur when the discs that cushion the bones of the spine begin to bulge or move out of position (known as 'slipping'), pressing on the nerve and triggering inflammation. Treatments include painkillers, physiotherapy and steroid injections but, in some cases, surgery may be necessary to remove the disc. The arthritis drug adalimumab may provide another option. The drug is a man-made version of a type of immune system compound called an antibody. These are highly targeted molecules programmed by the body to seek out specific bacteria or viruses. Scientists programme the synthetic antibody to target a specific compound in the body called tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF). Normally, this compound rises shortly after the body is infected with a bug. This increases inflammation and helps mobilise immune system cells to fight the invader. However - for reasons that are still unknown - in certain so-called autoimmune conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis or the skin condition psoriasis, levels of TNF are permanently high. This means that the immune system is constantly in a state of high-alert, which may cause the immune cells to malfunction and mistakenly attack healthy cells. Studies suggest that people with sciatica also have high levels of TNF, which contributes to the pain of the condition. In one study of 49 sciatica patients at the Royal Adelaide Hospital in Australia, around half of the patients who received a similar drug to block TNF had a 100 per cent reduction in leg pain, compared with a placebo. In a new trial at five hospitals across the UK (in North Wales, Keele, Nottingham, London and Cardiff), 300 patients will receive three injections of the drug adalimumab two weeks apart, or a placebo. In a new UK trial 300 patients will receive three injections of the drug adalimumab . They will also be given regular sessions of physiotherapy, and be monitored for two years. Commenting on the trial, Jane Tadman, of Arthritis Research UK, the charity that pioneered the use of this therapy for rheumatoid arthritis, says: 'This treatment has transformed the treatment of inflammatory arthritis worldwide. 'It's not a cure, but for those people in whom it does work, the results can be dramatic. 'Sciatica can be caused by inflammation of the sciatic nerve, and TNF is an important molecule in inflammation, so blocking its action could have a big impact. 'Applying anti-TNF to sciatica is a novel approach, and we await the findings of this study with considerable interest.' Meanwhile, research has linked being overweight with an increased risk of back pain and sciatica. A new study from scientists at the Finnish Institute of Occupational Health - based on more than 300,000 men and women - showed that overweight people had a 23 per cent greater risk of low back pain, and a 12 per cent increased risk of sciatica. Among the obese, the risk of back pain rose by 40 per cent, and sciatica by 54 per cent.","Adalimumab is a man-made version of a type of immune system compound .

"Police were called to the chambers of Canterbury Council on Tuesday evening after a meeting erupted into heated discussions following a decision by council members to remove the general manager from office. Jim Montague, the 'king of Canterbury', came under fire recently when it was alleged that he had spent over $50,000 of taxpayers money at an Enfield restaurant, in Sydney's inner west, as part of the council's 'hospitality policy'. He denies the claims. Police confirmed that officers from the Campsie local area command were called to council chambers to 'ensure and maintain order' when six of Canterbury's 10 councillors voted to remove Mr Montague despite the mayor adjourning the meeting. Canterbury Council general manager Jim Montague (left) and mayor Brian Robson (right) The packed chamber became a hive of activity when Mayor Brian Robson, a close associate of Mr Montague and a regular lunch companion, declared that the meeting was adjourned, reported The Sydney Morning Herald. He requested that the meeting be postponed until after the Independent Commission Against Corruption finalised their investigation into the allegations surrounding the matter, including Mr Montague's own claims against members of council. Mr Montague has been accused of tallying up a $50,000 bill at Il Buco, in Enfield, including spending over $1000 on lunch and dinner in a single day. The meals included a $105 bottle of wine, and an entree of king prawns and veal. Mr Montague denied the figures, and said that the bill had been rung up over a period of five years, rather than four. Mr Montague has been accused of tallying up a $50,000 bill at Il Buco, in Enfield . Police were called to the chambers of Canterbury Council on Tuesday evening after a meeting erupted into heated discussions . Despite the Mr Montague and Mayor Robson walking out, the majority of councillors continued with their intention to vote, deciding on the spot to remove the general manager and appoint a new head of council. Tensions arose when security guards were unsure whether they had authority to escort Mr Montague from his office, as Mayor Robson declared that the councillors action were illegal and that the general manager was still in authority. A spokesperson from the Campsie Police Station said that there had been no illegal activity and that no one had come to physical harm. 'The officers were called by an anonymous person to attend the chambers and were there as a precautionary measure only,' they said.

'There were various people at Il Buco that we have been to see for various reasons,' he said. 'I understand the community's concerns and I apologise for this'. Mayor Robson said that the meals were held to conduct council business, and that he would often take the chance to 'sit down and have a quiet lunch with the general manager on a Friday,' reported The Sydney Morning Herald.

"Stephen Williams, a Lib Dem MP for Bristol, said new waves of immigration were replacing the 'white working class' Pubs are closing because traditionally white working class areas have become home to mainly Muslim immigrants, a minister has said. Stephen Williams, a minister in the Department for Communities and Local Government, said pubs had shut down in his constituency after a wave of Somali migration. The Lib Dem, who represents a constituency in Bristol, said it was pointless trying to protect all pubs from closing because many had been abandoned by the new communities living around them. In a Government debate yesterday he told MPs that new waves of immigration were replacing the 'white working class' in some areas – meaning some pub closures were inevitable. Mr Williams' remarks came as the Government unveiled to stop pubs being demolished or converted which are deemed valuable to local communities. He said 'blanket protection' of every pub was impossible because it would mean keeping some open which had long become redundant. He said: 'In my own constituency, lots of pubs have closed but it is usually because of demographic change,' said the minister, who represents a seat in Bristol. 'Particularly in some parts of my constituency, which used to have ... 'a white working class community' 20 or 30 years ago are now populated primarily by recently-arrived Somalis and other people. 'Obviously the pubs in that area have closed. Some have been converted to other uses, some of them actually are still derelict.' The remarks come after Tory peer Lord Hodgson sparked controversy after claiming the growing Muslim population was one of the main reasons for the problems hitting the pub trade. Lord Hodgson said pubs are under threat in areas such as Leeds, Nottingham, Leicester and Birmingham . A series of amendments to the Infrastructure Bill were tabled including a cross-party effort to ensure pubs and other drinking establishments could not be demolished or have their use changed without planning permission. Lord Hodgson, who is a former brewery boss, said pubs are closing in areas with growing Muslim communities. Former brewery boss Lord Hodgson, pictured, has blamed the increasing size of Britain's Muslim population for the growing rate of pub closures . Speaking in the Lords, the peer - a former director of pub chain Marston's - said: 'Twenty-five years ago, the company of which I was a director would have operated probably a dozen pubs in Kidderminster, the home of the carpet trade. The carpet trade has gone and there are three pubs left. 'In areas of Nottingham, Leicester, Manchester, Leeds and Birmingham the increase in the Muslim population who don't drink leads to many pub closures. 'It is exceptionally hard for a publican who has put 10 years of his life into trying to build up a business to accept the inevitability of these tides of history.' He said the issue was one of the three main reasons pubs were going out of business, along with the 'inexorable rise of regulation' and the availability of low price alcohol in supermarkets. He added: 'The reasons for closure may be portrayed as rapacious owners increasing rent wishing to profit by turning pubs into houses or corner stores, but the tide is running against the ordinary pub.' Lord Hodgson said there was a danger companies would not invest in improving pubs if landlords could opt out of tied arrangements. 'No pub owner is going to invest many thousands of pounds, hundreds of thousands of pounds in some cases, if the tenant can then walk away from supplier agreements,' he said. Fiyaz Mughal, director of Faith Matters, an organisation which is inter-faith and anti-extremist, told the Independent in December that it was 'ridiculous' to blame Muslims for the closure of pubs. He said: 'The consumption and marketing of alcohol has also changed over time. What is also clear is that some pubs have been successful and others have not been able to generate customers and clients.' A former health minister has appeared to suggest that keeping pubs open helps alleviate pressure on the NHS. Tory Baroness Cumberlege told peers at question time: 'There is great merit in keeping the pubs open.' She said: 'Single men who are lonely and depressed are very often welcomed into pubs.' To laughter, Lady Cumberlege added: 'Their spirits are raised in all senses and they are not a burden on the NHS.' Responding for the Government, Baroness Jolly appeared at first to be taken aback by the comments, saying: 'Gosh, I'm not quite sure.' Lady Jolly quickly added: 'We're actively working with Public Health England on the practicalities of how health-related objectives for licensing of premises selling alcohol would work at a local level.' The exchange came as peers challenged the strengths of alcoholic drinks being sold in supermarkets.","Lib Dem minister Stephen Williams said Somali migrants didn't use pubs .

"A Chinese man whose jealous wife cut off his manhood twice when she discovered he had been cheating on her has been offered to star in a porn film. Fan Lung, 32, suffered his scorned wife's wrath after he used her mobile to send a sauce email to his lover in Shangqiu in central China's Henan province. A pornography production company has now reached out to Mr Fan, offering to pay for an x-rated film starring him and his mistress  Zhang Hung, 21. Fan Lung (right) turned on his wife (left) after she cut off his penis for a second time and he was spotted naked and bloody attacking her outside the hospital . Aptly named porn firm Bang You Later offered their 'deepest and sincere condolences' before offering to 'cover costs of production and distribution and you would keep 100 per cent of the proceeds,' The Mirror reports. 'Our intention is to help you financially through this incredibly delicate time but to also help you to restore your sexual confidence,' the company wrote in a letter to Mr Fan. Mr Fan lost his penis when wife Feng Lung, 30, discovered her his affair with Miss Zhang, and she cut off his manhood with a pair of scissors, then snipped it off again after surgeons reattached it. She is now facing jail after being arrested for causing grievous bodily harm. But after forgetting to log out of his account on his wife's phone  she came across the message and several others, and flew into a rage. Lover: Zhang Hung (left) visited Fan (right) in hospital and said she planned to marry him as soon as she could . Grabbing a pair of scissors she stormed into their bedroom where he was sleeping and cut off his penis. Surgeons were able to reattach it, but fuming Feng sneaked into his hospital room and cut it off again before throwing it out of a window. This prompted the cheat to turn on his wife and he was spotted naked and bloody attacking her outside the hospital. A hospital spokesman said: 'The first we were aware of what happened was when someone came into the reception area to say a naked man was beating up a woman outside the hospital. 'Staff rushed out to see what was happening and found the patient with blood streaming down his legs hitting the woman. 'He was stopped and the woman was taken in for treatment, and then we discovered she had chopped his penis off again.' Doctors and police officers combed the area outside but failed to find the man's missing member. They believe it may have been taken by a stray dog or cat. The hospital spokesman said: 'The man had lost a lot of blood and was taken in for emergency surgery. 'He is now in a stable condition but is extremely emotionally distraught.' Fan's lover, who visited him at the hospital, said she planned to marry him as soon as she could. 'It doesn't matter that he's lost his fertility, he has five children already,' Zhang said. Feng was discharged and is now under arrest for grievous bodily harm.","Fan Lung, 32, used his wife Feng's mobile to send saucy email to lover .

"Spain planned to attack Britain's colony in Australia and force them from the land by using cannons filled with fire-spreading 'hot shot', newly uncovered documents reveal. According naval archives the Spanish planned to lay siege on Sydney from the Spanish colonies in South America with a fleet of 100 boats. The invasion was intended to prevent the southern colony from being used by the British to cause 'great harm' to Spain's colonial interests in the Philippines and in central and southern America. King Carlos IV approved plans for the Spanish navy to launch a 100-ship attack and to fire new fire-speading ammunintion in their fight to expel Britain from their colony in Australia, new archival documents reveal . Spain wanted to 'take the fight to the British in the Pacific', and according to the documents, they feared Britain could attack them using the 'castaway bandits' it was sending there. The Spanish documents reveal that King Carlos IV approved the plot after a Spanish expedition arrived in Sydney in 1793. The British established a settlement there in 1788. Chris Maxworthy of the Australian Association for Maritime History said the Spanish intended to use heated ammunition that could set fire to ships and buildings on impact. 'The goal was the complete surrender by the British and their expulsion from the Australian land mass ... The effect [of the hot shot] would be to not only impact the targets ashore but also create multiple fires in the wooden buildings of that era in Sydney, particularly if the plans occurred during the hot summer months,' he told The Australian Financial Review. Chris Maxworthy of the Australian Association for Maritime History, above, said Spain's goal was the 'complete surrender by the British and their expulsion from the Australian land mass' The Dutch and the French had coveted territory in the southern Pacific but abandoned their plans after concluding  the land was unsuitable, but the Spanish were not deterred. Spanish naval commander Alessandro Malaspina reported back to his Government in the 1970s that Britain planned to use Australia for commercial reasons and to discover resources, rather than simply as a place to send their convicts. And he warned that Britain could use their colony as a base to launch an attack on Spain using an army of 'castaway bandits'. According to the historical documents, the deputy commander of the Spanish expedition, Jose de Bustamante y Guerra, proposed an invasion to King Carlos IV who approved it. He was then sent to Uruguay to start building the attack ships. But they never set sail. Mr Maxworthy said: 'As the military and naval commander, Bustamante was tasked to both defend South America from an anticipated British invasion, and to take the fight to the British in the Pacific.' If Spain had managed to seize the colony, historians say, Britain would have quickly recovered it. John West-Sooby, an expert on early Australian voyages, said the documents showed Spain was 'intended to strike first' and was concerned about the threat the British colony posed. He told the newspaper:  'The irritation of Madrid with respect to British 'incursions' into the Pacific during the eighteenth century is well known, but this confirms the bellicose attitude of the Spanish.'","Spain feared Britain could attack them with an army of 'castaway bandits'

"The lawyer for Liam Gallagher's American baby mother has warned him it would be 'foolish' to continue refusing to fly to New York to give a deposition. Ira Garr said that the Wonderwall singer will get fined again by a judge as he blamed his 'lack of focus' for the failure to make a deal.Garr said that Gallagher's divorce in Britain to All Saints singer Nicole Appleton had been 'far more taxing' than his child custody battle in New York, which was not apparently a priority. Mr Garr spoke out after a stormy week in Gallagher's bitter maintenance battle with US journalist Liza Ghorbani over their daughter Gemma, 21 months. Ghorbani's father Danny spoke for the first time to condemn Gallagher for 'dodging' US justice by failing to attend the last hearing because he was apparently ill. Scroll down for video . Fatherless: Liza Ghorbani's daughter Gemma has never met her father in the 21 months since she was born. Her mother is involved in a bitter legal case over how much maintenance Liam Gallaghter should pay . Criticised: Former Oasis singer Liam Gallagher was described as 'foolish' by the lawyer for Ghorbani if he failed to turn up again to a New York court to give evidence over the maintenance dispute . However that weekend he was seen walking hand in hand in London with his new girlfriend, Debbie Gwyther. A judge fined Mr Gallagher $5,000 and he will likely be reprimanded again if he fails to show up at his deposition next month said Mr Garr, whose previous clients include Rupert Murdoch.Garr said: 'I assume he will come over. 'The judge will sanction him again if he doesn't come. To not come over would be foolish.' Garr said that he believed a deal was not far off and hoped it would emerge in the coming months. All that remains are 'nitpicking issues' like how the ensure Gallagher pays and what to do if he stops paying. The main problem however 'seems to be the accountants'. Referring to Gallagher's divorce lawyer, Garr said: 'I think the cause is that everything is going through the accountants and Fiona Shackleton's office' Trying to explain why there was no deal with Gallagher, he said: 'It might be for want of a lack of a better word, a lack of focus. 'If you have lengthy financial matters in if there's a child support case it's far more taxing than the child support issue which is basically coming to a number and how it's going to be paid.' Gallagher, 42, had Gemma with Ghorbani, 40, in 2013 after she profiled him for the New York Times. Since then the two have been slogging it out in the courts about child support. Backing: Liza Ghorbani's father Danny said that Liam Gallagher had repeatedly 'failed to do the right thing' by his granddaughter as he spoke out in her support . Ghorbani had filed a $3 million lawsuit against Mr Gallagher at the Manhattan Family Court but after the case was dismissed she refiled in the Manhattan Supreme Court. Gallagher is currently paying her $5,000 a month until a final decision about child maintenance can be agreed. arr said that unless a deal is reached then the monthly payment could be reviewed every three years, and Mr Gallagher could end up being the loser. New York child custody laws state that Gallagher could be forced to pay more if his income goes up by 15 per cent in that time, not to mention the inconvenience of regular renegotiation. Garr said: 'Liam's band [Oasis] has disbanded. Let's say he and his brother work it out and get back together. 'If they did do they would make a zillion dollars. When [bands] don't perform in years and they go back on tour they make a fortune. 'Why would someone subject themselves to coming back [to New York] every three years? 'When you do an agreement it's done. That's it.' Gallagher is currently fighting a war on two fronts as the financial arrangements from his divorce to ex-wife Nicole Appleton, with whom he has a son, Gene, 13, have not been resolved. Until then his case against Ghorbani cannot be dealt with, he claims.Gallagher also has a daughter Molly, 16, and son Lennon, 15, from previous relationships. In his attack on Gallagher, Ghorbani, a retired housing executive who lives in Washington, said that he could 'no longer maintain my silence'. He said: 'Mr Gallagher has been given every opportunity to do the right thing by my granddaughter. He has had plenty of time to do so voluntarily but unfortunately he's failed. 'Instead, Mr Gallagher's adviser continues to spread misinformation, blaming our side for the lack of settlement while knowing full well that they are the ones who are continually delaying.'","Former Oasis singer has a 21-month-old daughter, Gemma, with American journalist Liza Ghorbani, who is suing him over child support .

"Mother-of-four Miss Henderson was reported missing shortly after 8am on Thursday morning . The boyfriend of missing mother-of-four Samantha Henderson has today been charged with her murder, as police continue to hunt for her body. Dominic Isom, 27, was remanded in custody this afternoon, nearly a week after Miss Henderson, whose children are one, two, four and six, was reported missing. Detectives investigating her disappearance said specialist officers have now been brought in as they continue to search an area of woodland near Corfe Castle, Dorset, where she was last seen. Miss Henderson was reported missing shortly after 8am on Thursday morning - nearly 18 hours after she was last seen collecting her children from Corfe Castle Primary School at around 3pm. Police helicopters have scoured the area, while yesterday 35 major crime officers and forensics experts combed allotments, outbuildings and the missing mother's home. Officers said they believe Miss Henderson 'has come to harm', and said the whereabouts of her body are still unknown. They urged members of the public to come forward with any information they may have. Detectives seized Miss Henderson's blue Peugeot from her home on Monday night and asked the public to help trace the car's movements – especially between 3pm on Wednesday and 10.25am on Thursday. Dorset Police said she was a 'prolific phone user' but that her mobile had not been found. Miss Henderson lives in a £325,000 four-bedroom cottage. It is believed her partner lived there for several years, but there is a 'for sale' sign outside and she had arranged to meet a house clearance firm on Monday. Isom's charge comes just 24 hours after police released CCTV footage of Miss Henderson, taken on the day she was last seen. In it, she can be seen in the footage moving animatedly around the shop wearing a pink jumper or coat and light blue jeans. Her long blonde hair is tied up in a ponytail. Sighting: Detectives searching for 25-year-old Samantha Henderson from Corfe Castle, Dorset, released this CCTV footage of her the day she disappeared yesterday. In it, she is seen shopping in The Sweet Shoppe . Hunt: Detectives investigating her disappearance said specialist officers have now been brought in as they continue to search an area of woodland near Corfe Castle, Dorset, where she was last seen . She appears to buy cigarettes from behind the counter while chatting to the shopkeeper and hesitates at the till as she enters her pin number before leaving the shop. Detectives leading the search for the missing mother's body are appealing for the public's help . Senior investigating officer Neil Devoto, of Dorset Police's Major Crime Investigation Team, said: 'This is a very difficult time for [Miss Henderson's] whole family and they have requested privacy. Her children are being cared for by relatives. 'It is also important to stress – as is typical in such circumstances – that it would be entirely inappropriate for Dorset Police to comment further ahead of the trial. 'We now believe Samantha has come to harm. At this time her whereabouts are still unknown and our search for her body continues. 'Searches of the Corfe Castle village area are ongoing. Specialist search officers have been brought in from Dorset and neighbouring forces to continue searching an area of woodland off the A351 near Corfe Castle. 'This latest development does not mean we do not want to hear from members of the public if they have any information that could help with the investigation into Samantha's death, no matter how seemingly insignificant. 'I am also urging anyone who saw Samantha after 3pm on Wednesday, had contact with her whether by phone or social media or has any information about her movements, to call me in confidence.' Isom will appear before Bournemouth Magistrates' Court on Wednesday. Witnesses and anyone with information should call Dorset Police in confidence on 101, quoting Operation Cavalier. Alternatively, call the free and anonymous Crimestoppers line on 0800 555 111.

"John Alite, 52, was an enforcer in the Gambino family for years, undertaking grisly crimes, including murder . John A Gotti's crew leader is now hoping to make a living giving talks to children about bullying. John Alite, 52, was an enforcer in the Gambino family for years, undertaking grisly crimes, including murder. But when he heard they wanted to kill him, he went on the run, until he was eventually captured and then gave evidence against Gotti Jr. at trial. He turned rat and linked his former best friend to a series of gangland slayings, boasted that he slept with his sister, reality television graduate Victoria Gotti, and claimed two police officers were in on a mob hit. It was Alite's decision to release a tell-all about his time in the Gambino crime family that forced Gotti to write his own recent memoir in spite of his mother's protests. But now Alite, who was released from prison in 2012, says he wants a fresh start and says he would be good for males that need inspirational talks. On his website he offers himself as a speaker, seeking to cash in on an activity that has already proved fruitful for him: talking. 'John offers all ages and groups a forceful message and precise tutorial on simply, how not to be a victim,' the site states. The website states: 'Over the course of a twenty-five-year career as a gangster he brutalized people, stabbing them, shooting them, beating them with clubs, blackjacks and baseball bats. He's not proud of that, but he doesn't try to hide from it either. It's who he was. In an interview with The Tampa Bay Times, he says: 'I feel guilty for almost all these things I did,' he said, 'except [drug dealer] John Gebert. I'd like to wake him up and kill him again. Unfortunately, I'm not past it.' John A Gotti's crew leader (seen here in 2004) is now hoping to make a living giving talks to children about bullying . On his website he offers himself as a speaker, and says he wants to be a role model to males who need guidance . The father-of-four says said that he still sees a therapist several times a week. 'I'm a human being,' he said. 'I'm not ashamed to tell my faults and be real. Hopefully, I will help some kids, whether it's one or a hundred. It helps me to live with myself and my past.' He says he nearly decided to pull the book by George Anastasia - 'Gotti's Rules: The Story of John Alite, Junior Gotti, and the Demise of the American Mafia' - when someone threatened his son. He nearly pulled the plug on the book last fall, he said, after someone threatened his son. 'I started getting nervous that I miscalculated,' he said. 'In our world, you don't go near kids. Alite and Gotti Jr (pictured) were best friends - Gotti Jr was his best man at his wedding . Alite and Junior were best friends - Gotti Jr was his best man at his wedding. But because he was of Albanian descent and not Italian, Alite could never have been a made man. After he fled to Rio de Janeiro, he spent two years in a Brazilian jail fighting extradition and then testified against Gotti Jr in 2009. Gotti Jr. was charged with racketeering, but never convicted. New York's Gambino family has been the subject of a steady stream of government indictments and prosecutions since the Dapper Don was sentenced to life in prison in 1992. He died behind bars in 2002. Gotti Jr.'s own recent prison stint ended in Demember 2009. He claims to have left the crime world behind in 1999, but recalls with great detail what the life afforded his father--like breaks from prison to visit his family and relax in freedom. On a so-called 'dental furlough,' Gotti says his father was escorted by armed guards from Green Haven correctional facility to a Manhattan dental office. John Gotti was one of the most notorious modern day mob bosses. His son, who followed in his father's footsteps until leaving the crime life in 1999, wrote a tell-all in order to protect the family name as Gambino turncoat John Alite pens his own memoirs . 'My father would go up to the dentist's office, open his mouth, and then go out the back of the building where one of the fellows would drive him away,' Gotti writes. The guards, paid off with hundreds of dollars, would wait patiently as Gotti went home, changed out of his prison jumpsuit and spent quality time with Gotti Jr. and the rest of the family. 'When it was time to return to the prison, my father's man would drive him back to the dentist's building, and he would emerge from the front entrance back into the custody of the marshals,' Gotti writes. Gotti recalls a time when, at just four years old, he visited his father in jail where he told him he wanted to be a police officer for Halloween. Gotti recalls his father saying: 'If I ever hear you let my son or any of my kids, or you for that matter, talk to that cop, or any other cop, I'll kill you.' Growing up Gotti: Gotti Jr., second from left, is seen here with his nephews and sister Victoria Gotti. Alite claimed to have had an affair with Victoria, which she denies . Despite growing up with a father in and out of prison and seeing other dark sides of crime life, Gotti Jr. would go on to follow in his dad's footsteps and join the notorious Gambinos. In his book, he describes how he first entered into the organization, a process called getting 'made.' 'There were roughly a dozen men sitting around a table…open seats for the new inductees,' he writes. 'A pin pricked my 'trigger' finger. A drop of blood was put on a picture of a saint, which was then burned in my hand. I moved the flaming picture from hand to hand, until it was totally consumed by the fire.' Gotti Jr. has been tried four times since 2005 for racketeering. Each trial ended in a hung jury. He said he left organized crime in 1999. The self-published ebook, out Monday, was not Gotti's first attempt at a memoir. He told the Daily News that he had over 300 pages of a previous iteration of the tome but destroyed it all to satisfy his worried mother. 'In 2010, I shredded it. I had completed 375 pages and I shredded 375 pages. I only had 70 pages more to go. So I apologized to everyone involved, but my family harmony is more important to me.' When he learned of Alite's tell-all, Gotti changed his mind and went to his mother to ask permission to write the book. 'If you never talk to me again, then I'm gonna have to live with it,' he said to his mother. 'That's your choice, that's your prerogative, but you're asking me to sit here and let them emasculate me and my father. No, Ma. I have the right to write our own history.'","John Alite, 52, worked with John Gotti Jr for years until he found out the mob were planning to kill him .

'I recognised that there were some people in the USA who were called storm chasers. 'I read a lot about them and thought their stories and pictures were awesome, which is when I realised I could do this too.

'If the storm moves slowly and I have some distance between me and it, I feel the calmness, peace and a sense of freedom which surrounds me on these endless highways. 'If the storm is really fast and dangerous, I have to deal with less time to take pictures and I often have to move to another position and look after my safety.

"A French mayor is set to remove an iconic statue of a woman symbolising France from his town hall - because she is black. The statue of Marianne features in thousands of public buildings in France as a national symbol of freedom and democracy in the French Republic. The effigies are usually of a white female wearing a cap, but for the last 16 years the statue in the council building in Fremainville, northern France, has been of a black woman. The black Marianne statue has been in Fremainville town hall since 1999, but new mayor Marcel Allegre deemed it not to be an appropriate representation of the French symbol - and had it removed . But the town's mayor Marcel Allegre, who won local elections in March, has now ordered it to be removed. He said: 'This black sculpture was a Marianne of liberty, but not a Marianne of the French Republic. She undoubtedly represented something, but not the French Republic.' Although Marianne is considered to be a national symbol, there is no official legislation how it should appear. The black Marianne's 'eviction' from Fremainville has now sparked outrage from the country's minority rights groups. Thaiba Bruni, spokeswoman for the Representative Council of France's Black Associations, said: 'Either we live in a white and racial Republic, and Marcel Allegre is right, or we live in a diverse Republic, and the mayor of Fremainville is wrong.' The organization is also calling upon France's National Association of Mayors to pick 'black, Arab or Asian woman' as a new Marianne. Maurice Maillet, the former mayor of Fremainville, in northern France, pictured, said he could see no reason why Marianne should not be black . Maurice Maillet, the town's mayor for 25 years until losing to Allegre, was confused by the decision. “I don’t see any reason why the French Republic would not be black,' he told France24. 'Just look at France’s national football team.' The decision to remove the black Marianne has also triggered a row in social media. One Twitter user wrote: 'In Fremainville, the first black Marianne de France is to be scrapped by the new mayor..It's stupid.' A reader of le Parisien newspaper wrote: 'It's very beautiful, and it's a shame especially in these troubled times to do this.' But another commented: 'We need to stop massacring the symbols of our history in the name of 'multiculturalism'. 'White or black, and why not yellow, our MARIANNE has always been white because we are in France, until proven otherwise, we are a white country.' Fremainville's Mayor Allegre has now told Le Parisien that he will not scrap the black Marianne, but instead place it in another municipal building in his town.","Mayor Marcel Allegre, of Fremainville, northern France, 'evicted' the statue .
Said the statue was 'a Marianne of liberty, but not... of the French Republic'

"Mourners gathered today for the funeral of the eighth Duke of Wellington, whose ancestor won the Battle of Waterloo. Arthur Valerian Wellesley, who was also known as the Prince of Waterloo, died peacefully at his home in Hampshire, on December 31. He was aged 99. A private funeral for relatives and family was held at Stratfield Saye Church near the family estate today. His coffin, draped in the Union Flag, was carried by soldiers from the Yorkshire Regiment - formerly The Duke of Wellington's Regiment. The coffin of the eighth Duke of Wellington, whose ancestor won the Battle of Waterloo, was carried by soldiers from the Yorkshire Regiment - formerly the Duke of Wellington's Regiment at his funeral today . The Duke was Deputy Colonel in Chief of the Yorkshire Regiment and had presented medals to the 3rd Battalion in recent years . The late Duke's 69-year-old son Charles, who is now the 9th Duke of Wellington, leads mourners at the service in Hampshire today . The Duke's death came just four months before the 200th anniversary of the Battle of Waterloo in which the British army, under the command of the 1st Duke of Wellington, defeated Napoleon in what is is now Belgium. Before his death, the 8th Duke spoke of the importance of marking the 200th anniversary of the victory. 'I am often asked whether we should not now, in these days of European unity, forget Waterloo and the battles of the past,' he said on the Waterloo 200 commemoration website. 'My reply is, history cannot be forgotten and we need to be reminded of the bravery of the thousands of men from many nations who fought and died in a few hours on June 18, 1815 and why their gallantry and sacrifice ensured peace in Europe for 50 years.' Like his ancestor, the 8th Duke boasted an impressive military record, winning the Military Cross for his service during the Second World War. Fighting with the Royal Horse Guards, he saw action in France and Belgium during the later stages of the war and also served in Cyprus in the early 1950s. Later, he was transferred to the Household Cavalry, taking command of the regiment in 1959. A year later, the Duke became colonel of the 22nd Armoured Brigade during its stint as a part of the British Army of the Rhine - the UK occupying force in Germany in the aftermath of World War Two. After retiring from the army in 1968, he went on to work for tractor manufacturers Massey Ferguson and as Deputy Lieutenant of Hampshire. Although he never saw active service in the military again, the 8th Duke retained close ties with the Armed Forces, serving as Deputy Colonel-in-Chief of the Yorkshire Regiment, Deputy Colonel of The Blues and Royals and an Honorary Colonel of the 2nd Battalion, Wessex Regiment. Mourners included Andrew Parker Bowles (left), the former husband of the Duchess of Cornwall, and Prince El Hassan bin Talal of Jordan (right) Having been awarded the Military Cross for  service during the Second World War, the 8th Duke kept close ties with the army after retiring . Mourners line the route as the cortège makes its way through the grounds of Stratfield Saye House to the nearby church this morning . His 69-year-old son Charles is now the 9th Duke of Wellington, while his grandson Arthur, 36, who is married to model Jemma Kidd, becomes heir to the Wellington title. Speaking after the eighth Duke's death, Sir Anthony Seldon, headmaster of Wellington College, set up in honour of the 1st Duke of Wellington,  said he was 'one of the finest people I have known in my life'. He said: 'He personified service, hard work, dignity and enthusiasm. 'Right until his final month, when I saw him with his daughter Lady Jane Wellesley at Stratfield Saye, he was full of zest and curiosity about everything that the young people were achieving at Wellington College, the school created in 1859 by Queen Victoria, Prince Albert and the Prime Minister Lord Derby, as the memorial to the first Duke, who had died in 1852. 'The whole Wellington College community is greatly saddened by this news. The Duke of Wellington, until the very end, was a regular visitor to the school. 'He was greatly looking forward to our celebrations in May and June of the 200th anniversary of the Battle of Waterloo. It has been the greatest privilege to have known him over the last 10 years since becoming Master of Wellington College.' Two uniformed soldiers from the Household Cavalry walk towards Stratfield Saye Church ahead of the funeral this morning . The Eighth Duke recently spoke of the importance of remembering the bravery of the men who were led by his ancestor, the first Duke . The death of the 8th Duke of Wellington marks the end of an era for one of the Britain's most eminent families. Founded by Arthur Wellesey, the 1st Duke of Wellington, the dynasty rose to prominence following his stunning victory at Waterloo, where he led a combined force of British, Flemish and Prussian troops to glory against the French army of Napoleon Bonaparte. Already 1st Marquess of Wellington, he was made a duke in recognition of the extraordinary success. The 1st Duke, who twice served as a Conservative prime minister, also established the family seat, the majestic Stratfield Saye in Hampshire, and cemented his outstanding reputation with 60 military victories and stints as Master of Horse for George IV and William IV. The Iron Duke: The 1st Duke of Wellington in 1815 in a Phillis portrait made shortly before Waterloo . Succession: Gerard Wellesley, the 7th Duke, took the title after his nephew Henry was killed in battle . Subsequent dukes have enjoyed glittering military careers, with the now deceased 8th Duke being awarded the Military Cross. However, the new generation, Charles, the 9th Duke, and his son Arthur, have taken the family in a new direction. Charles has enjoyed a career in philanthropy and briefly dabbled in politics, but most intriguingly, married into the now defunct Prussian royal family. Departed: The 8th Duke with his wife Diana McConnel in front of Stratfield Saye House in Hampshire where he died this morning aged 99 . His wife, Antonia, is the daughter of Prince Frederick of Prussia and a descendent of Kaiser Wilhelm II of Germany, the man who plunged Europe into war in 1914. Their son Arthur, one of five children, is a former equities trader who married model and socialite Jemma Kidd in 2005 and promptly moved her into the family home with his parents and grandparents. The couple, who married in Barbados, now have three children, four-year-old twins Mae Madeleine and Arthur Darcey, and baby Alfred, who was born earlier this year. The death of the 8th Duke marks the end of an era in which the title holders distinguished themselves militarily. The 2nd Duke, who was also called Arthur, held the position of Master of the Horse - a title that includes the management of the royal horses and hounds - under Queen Victoria. When Arthur died childless, the title passed to a nephew, Henry. When he too died childless, the title passed to his brother Arthur, another military man who also sat in the House of Lords. Arthur's descendants included another Arthur, the 5th Duke, who fought with the Grenadier Guards during the Boer War and World War I before becoming a Justice of the Peace. Tragically, his son Henry, the 6th Duke, who was killed aged 31 during the Salerno Landings in 1943. With Henry gone, the title passed to his uncle, Gerald, who founded the current branch of the family and was the father of Arthur Valerian who died today. His son, who held the title of the 8th Prince of Waterloo along with several others, served, like his ill-fated cousin, in the British Army during the Second World War. Fighting with the Royal Horse Guards, he saw action in France and Belgium during the later stages of the war and was awarded a military cross for his efforts.","Arthur Valerian Wellesley died at his family home in their Stratfield Saye Estate in Hampshire late last month .

"A conman was caught out by an online viral video after making a false £17,000 insurance claim that he suffered a horror injury in flash flooding. Stephen Robinson, 30, told Newcastle City Council he broke his ankle when a drain collapsed as he walked through water on a road near his home. The local authority passed the case to its specialist insurance firm who set aside a taxpayer funded cash pay-out. Stephen Giles claimed he broke his ankle when he walked over a collapsed drain but after a video went viral it was discovered that he broke it jumping into shallow flood water (pictured, his foot hangs at an angle) But officials discovered a YouTube video which showed Robinson acting up to a huge crowd as he leapt into the pool of water. Dozens of people cheered the show-off as he took a running jump into the flooded road, only to collapse onto the ground seconds later. There are then gasps of horror as he pulls his leg clear of the water to show his foot sticking out of his leg at an unnatural angle. Yesterday, Robinson was fined £600 and ordered to undertake 200 hours of unpaid work after admitting fraud by false representation at Newcastle Magistrates' Court. He admitted willingly jumping into the water in Pooley Road, Slatybridge on June 28, 2012, as the city was struck by flash flooding. Investigators discovered the heavyset fraudster landed on top of a hidden metal drain, which contributed to his injury. Giles can be seen leaping into the flood water to cheers from dozens of onlookers after flash flooding hit the area near his home in Slatybridge, Newcastle-Upon-Tyne, in June 2012 . Soon after he jumps in the water there are gasps of horror as he pulls his leg out to show his foot sticking out at an angle from his leg . The YouTube video has since been viewed more than 5,000 times, despite the efforts of a family member to have it removed. Asking for it to be taken down, a cousin said: 'He's traumatised by it as he is not the same person since it happened. 'He has heard it has been used in documentary on TV and is not happy about it! And does not want reminded of what happened to him please take it off. Another viewer wrote in the comments: 'Felt the need to say that not all people from Newcastle are as stupid as this.' DC Kate Sibley, of City of London Police, said: 'Stephen Robinson deliberately tried to defraud Newcastle Council and their insurers to financially benefit from his broken ankle. 'He broke his ankle because he was showing off in front of a crowd of onlookers. The YouTube video, which was discovered by officials investigating his insurance claim, has since been viewed more than 5,000 times, despite the efforts of a family member to have it removed . Robinson was fined £600 and ordered to undertake 200 hours of unpaid work after admitting fraud by false representation at Newcastle Magistrates' Court yesterday . 'This posing caused his downfall as the incident was uploaded to the internet and viewed by thousands of people. 'Insurance fraud is not a victimless crime, it is those who pay their council tax in Newcastle who would have lost out if they had paid compensation to Stephen Robinson.' Veronica Dunn, of Newcastle City Council, said: 'I am delighted with the outcome of this case.

"Jon Rixon (pictured) had a miracle escape after being buried by a flaming 80ft tree . A 62-year-old man had a miracle escape after he survived being crushed by a flaming 80ft  tree which was set on fire by a group of campers. Jon Rixon had been enjoying a morning stroll through the woods near Shrewsbury in Shropshire when he was buried underneath the huge 6.5 tonne oak. He broke his shoulder and several ribs after being struck by the heavy branches when the burning tree fell on a footpath at around 10am on Sunday. The RAF veteran was flown to hospital after being discovered in agony by passing cyclist Richard Pugh at Haughmond Hill. The collapse is believed to have been caused by a group of campers who had decided to start a fire in the hollow base of the tree. Today, wife Suzi Rixon said her husband, a father of six,  was lucky to be alive and slammed the 'irresponsible' actions of the campers. The 56-year-old, from Upper Battlefied, Shropshire, said: 'Jon has got a broken shoulder and several broken ribs but he is very lucky to be alive. 'He saw the smoke coming from the tree and he heard this almighty crack. 'He was able to run but with conditions being so muddy he was not able to get away entirely. 'If he had stayed where he was he might not be here today. 'I am just furious about the irresponsibility of the campers that set fire to the tree. It is just beyond belief. 'I think people need to be aware of the consequences of such reckless actions. 'It's shocking. I am so horrified. Setting fire to an enormous oak tree is beyond ridiculous. I am very angry about it. I'm so hugely grateful to Richard. He's an absolute star. 'Lots of people have been ringing up to see how Jon is. He was in a huge amount of pain and he's on morphine and antibiotics to make sure he doesn't get pneumonia.' Mr Rixon had been enjoying a morning stroll through the woods when he was crushed by the burning 6.5 tonne oak (pictured) Mr Pugh, 51, from, Shrewsbury, added: 'I was two thirds of the way along the path when I came across this guy sat on the side looking distressed. I said ""are you OK?"" 'And he said ""no not really"". I asked what happened and he said ""this tree has just fallen on top of me"". 'He said as he heard a crack he ran a little bit but it had pummelled him into the floor. He said he had managed to crawl out from underneath. 'Another lady turned up and she had been not far away when it had happened so she had seen the aftermath. 'It was evident he was in quite a lot of pain and he was going into shock as he was going whiter. They quickly realised they were not going to be able to move him to the road themselves and eventually an air ambulance helicopter was dispatched to the scene. Reckless: Campers are believed to have started the fire in a hole at the base of the enormous oak tree . The former RAF veteran was flown to hospital after being discovered in agony by passing cyclist Richard Pugh at Haughmond Hill . 'In the meantime the tree was roaring away,' Mr Pugh added. 'It was the biggest tree - around about 80ft tall and about 14ft across at some points.' Jon was flown to Royal Shrewsbury Hospital by the Midlands Air Ambulance where he remained in a stable condition today. A spokesperson for West Midlands Ambulance Service said: 'We were called just after 10am to reports of a man being hit by a tree. 'By the time we arrived it appears the man had crawled from under the tree and a man in his 60s was treated at the scene. 'He was given pain relief at the scene and airlifted to Royal Shrewsbury Hospital. Mr Rixon broke his shoulder and several ribs after being struck by the heavy branches when the burning tree fell on a footpath . 'An ambulance and a rapid response paramedic attended the scene.' Steve Morris, crew manager for Shropshire Fire and Rescue Service, said: 'The tree had a hollow trunk and the fire started in there. 'The fire had burned and weakened the tree itself and caused it to fall down across the path. Our problem was getting access and water to it. 'It would have been burning I suspect for a period of about 12 hours. He said crews spent more than three hours at the scene and used a pumping appliance and an off road vehicle to get water to the tree. 'Ambulance crews were there to deal with the casualty prior to our arrival,' he added. 'As with all outdoor fires we would discourage people from lighting fires outside in woodland because they can catch on so quickly and it is very difficult to put them out once they have started and they are away from the road making it difficult for us to get to them.'","Jon Rixon was enjoying a stroll when he was crushed under 80ft oak tree .

"If you spot a commuter with Apple headphones on, you may want to avoid sitting near them if they have an iPhone 6. During tests, this handset was found to be the loudest among Apple's full range of iPhones including the 2G through to last year's iPhone 6 Plus. And, the eight-year-old 2G was able to reach a higher volume than the 2010 iPhone 4. Scroll down for video . iClarified placed decibel meters by the speakers of each of Apple's iPhones, including 10 handsets from the original 2G to last year's iPhone 6 Plus (pictured left to right). The meter presents the maximum reading in A-weighted decibels, or dBA. This reading is used to show the loudness of a sound, as perceived by the ear . Having a louder phone can be beneficial, especially when playing music or conducting a phone call on loudspeaker. But exposure to excessively loud noise - particularly when directed through headphones - can cause health problems, too. In environments where noise exceeds 85 dBA, for example, employees are required to wear ear protectors. And, as a comparison, average sound levels produced by a live band are around 110 dBA. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), exposure to these noise levels can disturb sleep, raise blood pressure and even increase the chances of heart disease. The latest sound test was carried out by iClarified, and was a follow-up to a sound test the site filmed after the iPhone 5 was released in 2012. In the latest video, a decibel meter is placed beneath the speaker of each handset and music is played at full volume. The meter  presents the maximum reading in A-weighted decibels, or dBA. This reading is used to show the relative loudness of a sound in the air, as it's perceived by the ear. iPhone 2G: 94.3 dBA . iPhone 3G: 98.6 dBA . iPhone 3GS: 103.6 dBA . iPhone 4: 92.9 dBA . iPhone 4S: 101.1 dBA . iPhone 5: 104.0 dBA . iPhone 5C: 102.0 dBA . iPhone 5S: 103.6 dBA . iPhone 6: 105.4 dBA . iPhone 6 Plus: 105.0 dBA . Using this method, low frequency sounds are reduced, compared to unweighted decibels, because the ear doesn't hear lower frequencies as well as higher ones. A typical rating is around 25 dBA, which is 25 A-weighted decibels above the threshold of a person's hearing, and is said to be relative to the loudness of a person whispering in a quiet room. The meter changes position below the different handsets because the speaker changes position on each model, explained iClarified. The iPhone 6 had the loudest speakers on test, with a reading of 104.5 dBA, beating the larger Plus by 0.4 dBA. The iPhone 4 was the quietest, at 92.9 dBA, which was worse than the original 2G, which had a reading of 94.3 dBA. The iPhone 5 was in third place on 104 dBA. The iPhone 3GS and 5S had the same reading, at 103.6 dBA, and the 5C registered a reading of 102 dBA. The speakers on the iPhone 3G produced 98.6 dBA. This isn't the first test in which the iPhone 4 performed worse than the original 2007 2G. The iPhone 6 (left) had the loudest speakers on test, with a reading of 104.5 dBA, beating the larger Plus by 0.4 dBA. The iPhone 4 (right) was the quietest, at 92.9 dBA, which was worse than the original 2G with 94.3 dBA . In 2013, fan site EverythingApplePro created a video test of eight handsets, including the 2G up to the 5S. Each of the handsets were 'freshly restored and not jailbroken' meaning they each had the same default settings and all applications were force closed beforehand. In the first test, all the phones were powered off simultaneously and the 3GS shut down fastest, followed by 3G, then the 4, then the original model. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), 40 per cent of Europe’s population is exposed to noise levels in excess of 55dB - about the same level of a noisy office. The average washing machine has a recorded sound level of 70dB, refrigerators average at around 50dB refrigerator while in some instances food processors can reach up to 90dB. WHO says this amount of noise is enough to disturb sleep, raise blood pressure and even increase the chances of heart disease. According to a survey of 2,000 UK adults by John Lewis, 39 per cent of people will avoid using technology appliances at certain times because of the noise they produce. Meanwhile, almost a third of people find it difficult to drown out the noise and almost half consider sound an important factor in their purchasing decision when buying home appliances. The worst offending items in the home, on average, include: . Food mixer - 90dB . Tumble dryer - 60dB . Washing machine - 70dB . Vacuum cleaner - 70dB . Refrigerator - 50dB . The newer handsets all took noticeably longer than the older models, but took exactly the same amount of time as each other, to the second. Each of the phones booted up at different times, but EverythingApplePro highlights that the models differ in the amount of processing power and RAM and software between the newest and oldest phones, meaning this was not unexpected. This isn't the first test in which the iPhone 4 performed worse than the original 2007 2G. A video from EverythingApplePro found the original  retro model outperfomed more recent models in terms of performance. In tests,  newer models  booted up first, yet the original phone (far right) booted up faster than the iPhone 4 . The newer models all booted up first, and at almost the same time, yet the original phone booted up faster than the iPhone 4. Apple's iPhone 3G was the slowest to boost. In the final tests, EverythingApplePro launched the Reddit.com, and Apple.com websites. The male voiceover explained that the 5S loads sites 'instantaneously' adding: 'the extra processing power and the new Wi-Fi capabilities, its an amazing device'. When launching Reddit.com, the iPhone 5 beat the 5 and the voiceover continued the loading times go 'downhill' from there. In conclusion, the video maker claimed: 'I learnt that the amount of processing power is greater as the generation goes on, but it's marginally less noticeable the higher you go, so if you have a 5 I wouldn't really recommend upgrading to a 5S just based on the fact you want extra amount of power, because it has an amazing amount of power as it is.' In the final tests, EverythingApplePro launched the Reddit.com, and Apple.com websites, pictured. During  the video, the voiceover explained the 5S loads sites 'instantaneously'. When launching Reddit.com, the iPhone 5 beat the 5C but the rest of the handsets loaded the page slower than its successor .","iClarified placed decibel meters by the speakers of each of Apple's iPhones .

"These jaw-some images show what it's like for unlucky fish to look inside the mouth of a tiger shark just before travelling down to its belly. Captured in amazing detail, the unique pictures show the alien-like anatomy of the shark and reveal rows upon rows of razor sharp teeth and white-coloured gills. The incredible photographs were taken when a curious shark began to inspect the camera of British-born photographer, Adam Hanlon, 46, during an expedition in the Bahamas. Scroll down for video . The sharks that Adam Hanlon photographed were likely interested in the photographer's camera, and decided to investigate using the sensory organs in its mouth . Photographer Hanlon, 46, was leading an expedition in the Bahamas when he took close-up shots of a shark's mouth around his camera . After sensing electronic impulses omitted by Adam's camera, the inquisitive creature began to gently mouth at the camera's housing allowing him capture the unusual perspective. With sensory organs known as the ampullae of Lorenzini, the shark uses its mouth as an electroreceptor to 'feel' out its surroundings. Luckily for Mr Hanlon, the local fishermen have created an astonishing relationship with the sharks that sees them reward the shark for good behaviour, allowing extraordinary encounters to occur. He said: 'I was lucky to be able to get my camera set up as the sharks made their approach. 'They are pretty slow and cautious as they come in, and by reading their behaviour, you can predict when they are showing interest in the camera. 'Many sharks use the sensory organs in their mouths and noses to gather information about their environments.' A reward system that gives sharks treats for good behaviour allows divers to photograph the animals close up and capture extraordinary encounters like Mr Hanlon's . The shark's many rows of teeth are not immediately visible when it is swimming around normally, but begin to become visible when it opens its mouth to investigate and object or attack prey . Mr Hanlon was able to photograph the sharks opening their mouths wide, exposing rows of teeth and gills along with sensory organs . 'It's likely the sharks sense the camera's electronics and attempt to find out what they are,' said Mr Hanlon, who grew up in South Africa and lead a five-day dive for his underwater photography resource Wetpixel. 'This can sometimes involve them gently mouthing things that are unfamiliar or that they are interested in.' The divers on the Bahamas expedition encountered both tiger, lemon and reef sharks, which they lured by releasing 'tasty smelling' water into the sea. A crate of food was then brought down to the ocean floor to keep the sharks around while photographers in scuba gear took photos on  dives that lasted hours. Mr Hanlon, who shot the inside of the animal's mouth on the expedition's final day, said that the sharks didn't mean him any harm when they exposed him to the image that their prey sees right before the end. 'They're not attempting to bite but rather trying to feel the camera to see what it is,' he said. 'The sharks aren't fed if they exhibit negative behaviours, like nosing at the bait box or approaching from behind.' The divers on Mr Hanlon's expedition were exposed to lemon, reef and tiger sharks during five days exploring the waters around the Bahamas . Lemon and reef sharks normally do not exceed 10 feet long, while tiger sharks often reach 14 feet and large specimens have been as long as 25 feet . Crates of food were brought down to the seafloor in order to keep the sharks interested while photographers took pictures of the creatures . While lemon and reef sharks don't normally grow to more than 10 feet, tiger sharks are often as long as 14 feet, with the largest specimens reaching  25 feet. Tiger sharks are second in attacks on humans to great whites, but Mr Hanlon assured his divers that they were not in danger. Their jaws are powerful enough to crack sea turtles' shells, according to National Geographic. 'Sharks are highly intelligent and follow the normal rules for animal behaviour, they figure out quickly that if they are to be fed, they need to follow certain 'rules,' he said. Mr Hanlon, who has been diving since the mid-1980s and owns a dive school in Lancaster, England, was happy that he got to see a different angle on the dangerous sea creatures. 'It was an amazing experience, I was glad I got to get such unusual looking photographs,' he said. The diver led the Bahamas expedition for Wetpixel earlier this month, with divers from the US, UK, China and Finland, including Olympic medal-winning cyclist Chris Boardman. The jaws of a tiger shark, which are second in attacks on humans only to great whites, are powerful enough to crunch the shells of sea turtles . Mr Hanlon said that sharks are intelligent and find out that the way to be fed regularly means sticking to 'rules' such as not attacking humans .","Adam Hanlon, 46, captured shot of tiger shark's teeth and gills during expedition in the Bahamas .

"Reality stars Jim Bob and Michelle Duggar's conservative evangelical Christian beliefs are so extreme that they once forbid daughter Jill from helping a member of their extended family because the girl was pregnant outside of wedlock. On hit TLC reality series 19 Kids and Counting, the Duggars like to project an image of wholesome family values, but a series of incidents in recent months have revealed a darker side to the family's beliefs. The latest allegations concern Susanna Keller, the 22-year-old younger sister of Anna Duggar who is married to oldest son Josh. Scroll down for video . The family's Christian beliefs are so extreme that daughter Jill, right, was forbidden from helping Susanna Keller, left, the youngest sister of Anna Duggar, when she became pregnant outside of wedlock in 2012 . When Susanna give birth to her first child two years ago, Jill Duggar – a practicing midwife – was forbidden from helping by her strict parents who didn't want her fraternizing with an unwed mother. 'Jill was very excited to assist Susanna through the birth,' a source told Radar about 23-year-old Anna who is currently pregnant and expecting her first child. 'Michelle and Jim Bob, however, wouldn't let her participate. They thought Jill shouldn't be exposed to an unmarried mother in that condition.' Susanna was once a close friend of the family. She regularly featured on the show in 2008 back when it was 17 Kids and Counting and she acted as Anna and Josh’s courting chaperone. All that changed in 2012 when she became pregnant with daughter Noelle. Patriarch Jim Bob felt that 'Keller's slide into sin' warranted cutting off all contact and striking even the mention of Susanna's name from the family’s show. 'It would be bad for the Duggar brand. She broke away from everything his family represents, so viewers shouldn’t expect any televised trips to visit this in-law,' a source told OK! magazine. On hit TLC reality series 19 Kids and Counting, Jim Bob and Jill Duggars like to project an image of wholesome family values, but a series of incidents in recent months have revealed a darker side to the family's beliefs . The Duggars are well known for following a hardline Christian sect known as Quiverfull that promotes procreation and eschews all forms of birth control. In recent months the spotlight has fallen on the family's staunch stance on issues such as homosexuality and abortion. Despite one of Michelle's own sisters being in a lesbian relationship, the family have been very public about their feelings about homosexuality. In November the Duggars deleted photos of same-sex couples kissing from their official Facebook page after they had asked people to share photos, while oldest son Josh recently led an Arkansas rally protesting against gay marriage. Earlier this month a lesbian couple staged a kissing protest outside the home of the Duggar family, the stars of TLC's 19 Kids And Counting, who are well known for their Conservative Christian values and intolerance toward homosexuality. Texas couple Tandra Barnfield and Samantha Muzny say they are big fans of the reality show but are unhappy that patriarch Jim Bob, his wife Michelle and their clan so publicly oppose their wish to get married. The gay couple, who have three children, were visiting relatives in Tontitown, Arkansas, on Saturday when they decided to stop and have a photo taken of them kissing outside the Duggar's home. Susanna was once a close friend of the family but that all changed in 2012 when she became pregnant with daughter Noelle and din't marry the father . Texas couple Tandra Barnfield and Samantha Muzny staged a kissing protest outside the home of the Duggar family who are well known for their Conservative Christian values and intolerance toward homosexuality . 'My cousin lives just a few doors down from the Duggars. When we saw the house, it just lit a fire underneath us,' Barnfield told Radar. 'I said, 'Let's go make out!' My sister took the photo.' 'I want to get married to my girlfriend. And the Duggars are fighting my right to do so,' said Barnfield. 'It upsets me. If you won't let me get married, I'm going to make out with my girlfriend in front of you.' Despite the couple's frustration with the Duggars' stance on gay marriage, they say they are long-time fans of the hit show. 'We love the Duggars, we watch their show all the time,' said Barnfield. 'I also have morals and love God. They sit there and say they love everybody too, but then they fight against my rights.' 'They marry off their daughters to men very young. I don't protest their lifestyle!' The relationship between Michelle Duggar's older sister Evelyn Ruark, 63, and her partner Sharon Callahan, 52, has never been mentioned on 19 Kids And Counting. Just as the Duggars have issues with homosexuals so too Michelle's family have concerns over her unusual lifestyle choices and extreme Christian beliefs. The Duggars are well known for following a hardline Christian sect known as Quiverfull that promotes procreation and eschews all forms of birth control . Speaking to The National Enquirer in 2010, Sharon described herself as a 'significant other' of Evelyn and revealed the couple's concerns about the Duggar family's ties to the Quiverfull movement. 'We are worried about them,' Sharon said. 'We have often thought that Quiverfull is a cult. It appears to be brainwashing to me.' Quiverfull is a movement among some conservative evangelical Protestant couples that promotes procreation, eschews all forms of birth control and sees children as a blessing from God. Evelyn featured in an early episode of the reality show when the Duggar family had a get together with Michelle's siblings and her father. Girlfriend Sharon wasn't featured or even mentioned in the episode. Josh, the eldest Duggar son, moved from Arkansas to DC a year and a half ago to work for the conservative lobbying group the Family Research Council, where he is an Executive Director. The Duggars' conservative Christian values and close-knit family has made 19 Kids and Counting one of TLC's most successful shows. Texas couple Tandra Barnfield, left, and Samantha Muzny, right, have three kids together and say they are eager to get married once the law changes in their home state . But accusations of gay 'fear-mongering' appeared to threaten the reality show's future in November, when more than 180,000 people signed a petition asking the network to end the series after anti-equality comments made by Michelle. In August the mom had lent her star power for a campaign to strike down an ordinance that would prohibit businesses from discriminating against gender and sexual orientation. Her voice was used in a robocall message sent to Fayetteville, Arkansas, residents that asked them to vote against the ordinance that would protect members of the gay and transgender communities. She said: 'I don't believe the citizens of Fayetteville would want males with past child predator convictions that claim they are female to have a legal right to enter private areas that are reserved for women and girls.' The series had returned for ninth season in September. The political move prompted a petition on Change.org launched by Jim Wissick to axe the show after hearing Duggar's words that he said 'reek of ignorance and fear mongering.' Michelle Duggar, matriarch of the conservative Christian stars of TLC's 19 Kids And Counting, has an older sister, Evelyn Ruark, right, who is a lesbian with a long-term partner . He wrote on the petition page: 'Just because someone is transgendered doesn't mean they are a child predator or a rapist. The claim that this ordinance would provide predators with access to women's restrooms in order to assault or leer at girls or women is nothing more than fear-mongering and spreading ignorance and hatred.' Supports of the Duggars have launched a rival petition to keep the show on TV, which raised over 12,000 votes. 'Many that may or may not agree with their personal beliefs, but this does not mean that they shouldn't be allowed their reality show or that they should be attacked for their personal beliefs,' the organizer wrote. Last month Michelle's husband Jim Bob Duggar said he wasn't worried about by the petition. 'They won't succeed,' the 49-year-old said. 'Our show is the number one show on TLC. It's a small group creating this fuss. All it has done is give us more exposure.' In November the Duggars deleted photos of same-sex couples, above, kissing from their official Facebook page after they had asked people to share photos . He told The Pathway, an evangelical Christian publication run by the Missouri Baptist Convention, that they family gained 50,000 Facebook fans following the outcry. Michelle Ruark was born the youngest of Garrett and Ethel Ruark's seven children; her five sisters and brother were named Pam, Evelyn, Carol, Freda, Kathie, and Garrett Jr. She was quite a bit younger than most of her siblings, and when the family relocated from Arkansas to Ohio in the early 80s, she stayed behind to marry Jim Bob. There have been rumors that the Ruarks, who are not strongly religious, don't agree with Michelle and Jim Bob's way of life.","The Duggar's Christian beliefs are so extreme that they forbid daughter Jill from helping Susanna Keller when she was pregnant in 2012 .

"On a mission: Ania Lisewska, 21, has reportedly vowed to bed 100,000 men across the globe . A Polish woman has reportedly vowed to travel to every city across the world in a bizarre quest to sleep with 100,000 men. Ania Lisewska from Warsaw embarked on the unusual mission in her home city last month and has so far added 284 notches to her bedpost, according to the Huffington Post. But while the 21-year-old's long term boyfriend is more forgiving than most - he hasn't dumped her after all - he's understandably 'not thrilled' by the idea. Miss Lisewska said that he has 'had to come to terms with it'. She told the Austrian Times: 'I want men from Poland, Europe and all around the world. I love sex, fun and men. 'In Poland the subject of sex is still taboo and anyone who wants to fulfill their sexual fantasies is considered a deviant, a w**** or mentally ill.' Miss Lisewska says that she will only look to complete the task at the weekends and has set up a Facebook page and a website to chart her exploits - pages that her less than enamoured boyfriend might not want to save to his favourites. She adds that she hopes to spend at least 20 minutes with each partner. But the details of her apparently ambitious aim have cast doubt on its legitimacy, with several reports suggesting that it might be a hoax. According to reports, having sex with that many people for 20 minutes at a time would take Miss Lisewska 3.8 years to complete if she didn't stop for food or sleep. Seeing as she only plans to partake on Saturdays and Sundays, the task would take 20 years non-stop. Assuming she lives to the age of 81, to hit 100,000 Miss Lisewska would have to up her quota to around 16 men on both days of the weekend. Goal: Miss Lisewska's boyfriend is said to be 'not thrilled' by her plan .","Ania Lisewska is said to have started her quest in Warsaw last month .

The Tower Bridge Exhibition, one of London’s most iconic attractions, has announced an exclusive one-off programme of yoga classes that will taking place on the glass floors along the high-level walkways 138ft above the Thames . The classes will allow participants of all abilities to perfect their practice whilst enjoying the river views suspended over the Thames, as well as road and pedestrian life – all moving at pace 42 metres below. The new glass floor across each walkway comprises of six panels, each weighing 530 kilograms, supported by a carbon steel framework weighing approximately 1,000 kilograms, and designed to withstand the weight equivalent of one elephant and two London Black Cabs. The panels measure 11 metres in length and 1.8 metres in width and cost £1 million to install. The Walkways original steel lattice structure has been preserved under the glass.

"A Headmaster who ran a dating website and private health club from his school earned £390,000 in one year, MPs were told yesterday. Sir Greg Martin pocketed £161,000 as sole director of a leisure centre that operates on his school’s site. He also received more than £229,000 in basic salary and pension contributions as executive head, the Commons public accounts committee heard. And bizarrely, the committee was told Sir Greg ran a dating website that has the same address as the school. Sir Greg Martin, who had an income of almost £400,000, was accused by MPs of ‘taking his eye off the ball’ The dating business had a Twitter account featuring pictures of a woman in black underwear, the MPs were told. Margaret Hodge, the Labour MP who chairs the committee, said she was ‘gobsmacked’ by Sir Greg’s pay at Durand Academy in Stockwell, south London. ‘You are being paid a lot of money as a headteacher. You take yourself a generous slug of money, which we believe to be public money,’ she said. Sir Greg was challenged about dating firm The Coterie London, which he set up with friends and used the school site as a registered address . ‘You then find time – with your school having been seen as excellent but now only being rated as good by Ofsted – to set up a dating agency. ‘When I looked, somebody called Saffron, who works on the Twitter account, was semi-nude with all sorts of black underwear all over the place. ‘It seems deeply inappropriate for a head teacher to do that on premises where you are also conducting educational business.’ MPs expressed disbelief at the Twitter account of 'Saffron' who was working for the dating agency . It is not known if Sir Greg makes a profit from the dating business, but the £390,000 combined package of his health club role, salary and benefits made him the best-paid school leader in the country in 2012/13. In 2013/14 the head took home £44,000 less because his school payouts were lower than the year before. The academy trust faces being hit with a financial notice to improve by the Education Funding Agency. The agency can bring in new staff – including a new head – if it is not satisfied. It is concerned about the contracts that allow Sir Greg to operate the leisure centre. The cross-party panel of MPs said the money generated from Sir Greg operating a leisure and accommodation business from the site of the school should have gone back into the education of the students. Mrs Hodge added: ‘It was wrong to take the money. The £161,000 you made could have been used to benefit the education of children. ‘You had a perfectly good salary as a headteacher of more than £200,000.’ Sir Greg insisted the leisure business cash subsidised school lunches, evening childcare and free boarding. MPs praised the Durand Primary School in Stockwell for its educational achievements, but questioned Sir Greg's other financial interests . He said: ‘There’s a swimming pool you wouldn’t have had, there’s a boarding school you wouldn’t have had, there’s middle schools you wouldn’t have had, there’s subsidised food, there are small classes. Are you saying that’s wrong?’ Chris Wormald, permanent secretary at the Department for Education, said the ministry had concerns with the set-up of the leisure contract. Sir Greg protested that MPs should not be quizzing him about his private life and private business interests . In a statement issued after the hearing, Sir Greg said Durand’s success was underpinned by private investment and he was proud that it was ‘driving aspiration and expanding choice and opportunity for children’. Sir Greg applied to set up a state boarding school in West Sussex only for South Downs National Park to reject the proposals. It is understood that his dating site is called The Coterie. Public Accounts Committee chairman Margaret Hodge said it was wrong that Sir Greg had found time to set up a dating agency while his school was downgraded from excellent to good . .","Sir Greg Martin grilled by MPs over running extra businesses on the side .

"Lung cancer death rates among European women are expected to overtake those of breast cancer for the first time this year. The trend is largely driven by women in the UK and their long history of smoking, say researchers. Predicted lung cancer incidence for women in Europe is set to rise by 9 per cent between 2009 and 2015, reaching a level of 14.24 per 100,000 of population. In contrast, death rates from breast cancer are due to fall by 10.2 per cent to 14.22 per 100,000. Lung cancer death rates among European women are expected to overtake those of breast cancer this year. This trend is largely driven by British women's propensity to smoke, according to new research (file photo) The bleakest women's lung cancer forecasts are for the UK and Poland, with 2015 death rates of 21 and 17 per 100,000 of population respectively. At the other end of the scale, just eight women per 100,000 are predicted to die from lung cancer in Spain. Despite lung cancer death rates statistically overtaking those of breast cancer, the total number of women dying from breast cancer is calculated to remain slightly higher. Lung cancer is predicted to kill 87,500 European women this year and breast cancer 90,800. Lead researcher Professor Carlo La Vecchia, from the University of Milan in Italy, said: 'UK and Polish women, particularly UK women, have long had much higher lung cancer rates than most other European countries (except Denmark, which is not considered separately in this study). 'This is due to the fact that British women started smoking during the Second World War, while in most other EU countries women started to smoke after 1968. It is worrying that female lung cancer rates are not decreasing in the UK, but this probably reflects the fact that there was an additional rise in smoking prevalence in the UK as well in the post-1968 generation - those born after 1950.' The study looked at cancer rates in 28 EU member states as a whole and also in the six largest countries, France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Spain and the UK. As well as assessing overall cancer trends, it focused on individual cancers of the stomach, intestines, pancreas, lung, prostate, breast, and uterus/cervix, as well as leukaemia. It predicted a total of 1,359,100 deaths from cancer in the countries in 2015, corresponding to an incident rate of 138.4 per 100,000 men and 83.9 per 100,000 women. Lung cancer is one of the most common and serious types of cancer. Over 41,000 people are diagnosed with the condition every year in the UK. There are usually no signs or symptoms in the early stages of lung cancer, but many people with the condition will eventually develop symptoms including: . People with these symptoms are advised to visit their GP. Source: NHS Choices . Overall cancer deaths were due to fall by 7.5 per cent and 6 per cent in men and women respectively since 2009. In 1988, more than a quarter of men and a fifth of women died of cancer. Compared with that year, more than 325,000 cancer deaths are likely to be avoided in 2015. Predicted death rates for lung, bowel and prostate cancer in men are expected to fall by 9 per cent, 5 per cent and 12 per cent respectively since 2009. Death rates from pancreatic cancer since 2009 are forecast to rise by 4 per cent in men and 5 per cent in women. Prof La Vecchia added: 'We still have to be cautious about the lung cancer rates in women since these are predictions. The data for real death rates in 2015 in the EU as a whole will be available in three to four years. 'Further caution is required due to the fact that the absolute numbers of deaths in 2015 remains higher for breast than for lung. However, the 2015 predictions confirm our projections on long-term trends made two years ago that lung cancer death rates would overtake breast cancer in women around 2015.' Co-author Professor Fabio Levi, from the University of Lausanne in Switzerland, said: 'While the downward trends in overall cancer death rates is good news, smoking still remains the greatest cause of cancer deaths in the EU. 'For instance, smoking probably accounts for 15 per cent to 25 per cent of all pancreatic cancers, 85 per cent to 90 per cent of all lung cancers, and is implicated in a number of other cancers too. The differences in death rates between European countries remains a concern, with higher rates in the member states that joined most recently, such as the central and eastern European countries.' The findings appear in the journal Annals Of Oncology, whose associate editor for epidemiology Professor Paolo Boffetta said: 'The decrease in overall cancer mortality rates among European men and women which started in the 1990s does not seem to slow down: this is the major favourable conclusion of the 2015 report. The bleakest women's lung cancer forecasts are for the UK and Poland, with 2015 death rates of 21 and 17 per 100,000 of population respectively. Pictured is a chest X-ray of a smoker showing lung cancer . 'On the other hand, the continuing increase in lung cancer mortality among European women represents a challenge for cancer control, and the steady increase in pancreatic cancer deserves high priority for research.' Dr Penny Woods, chief executive of the British Lung Foundation, said: 'This latest forecast is unfortunately not surprising, and demonstrates once again just how poorly the UK measures up to the rest of Europe in this arena. Lung cancer rates in UK women far exceed those of their EU neighbours - and should be a cause of national embarrassment. 'More than four in five cases of lung cancer are caused by smoking. It is essential that women - and men - quit smoking to lessen their chances of developing this condition or, better yet, never start at all. 'If we are to reduce the death toll of this devastating cancer, we must see it given the same level of investment in research as we have seen afforded to other cancers, such as breast cancer. 'It is also essential we see greater awareness of signs and symptoms, such as a persistent cough, to improve early diagnosis.'","Lung cancer death rates are set to overtake breast cancer deaths this year .

"Virgin Atlantic passengers flying from John F. Kennedy International Airport last night were forced to sit on their plane for six hours before getting trapped inside the terminal with nowhere to go. By the time passengers on the London-bound flight were let off the plane, roads and public transport had shut down - forcing them to spend the night. But Virgin was not prepared for the ordeal, according to passengers. The airline said it was unable to get them their luggage and left them with a $15 meal voucher. 'It was like a murder mystery suspense movie - no one could give us any answers,' one passenger, Alexis Dehasse, a British music producer, told DailyMail.com. 'There was nowhere to go. No food and no water.' Scroll down for video . Abandoned: Passengers sleep inside John F. Kennedy International Airport in the early hours of Tuesday after their plane was unable to take off because of the bad weather . Desperate: The passengers had been unable to get their luggage because of the icy conditions . Going nowhere: An image shows the plane that was thwarted by passenger illness, a technical fault and ultimately the snowstorm - leaving the hundreds of passengers stranded inside JFK on Monday night . Dehasse was supposed to take Flight VS4 to London at 6.30pm but after the passengers were seated on the plane, one traveler became sick and had to be taken off, he said. Crews then started the de-icing process again and were eventually unable to take off due to the snowstorm. Eventually, passengers were let off the plane after midnight. Dehasse said he could have stayed with a friend, but road closures meant he was unable to leave. All vehicles, including taxis, had been ordered off the road by 11pm and public transport, including every subway line, was close to passengers. He said that the crew from his flight left the passengers so they could sleep on the plane. 'We weren't allowed out. That threat of not being able to leave the airport... it was pretty traumatic,' Dehasse said. 'The whole thing was a mess.' He added that the staff simply did not know what to do with the passengers. 'They knew what was coming so they should've had extra staff on the ground,' he said. 'They should've had a contingency plan and they didn't. They weren't prepared.' The company told him that his flight should be leaving later this evening, he said. He is flying to Italy in a couple of days for more shows and fears he will now not be able to take the trip, he said. Another passenger aboard the flight, Felix Kunze, from Brooklyn, said the airline had only given them each a $15 vouchers for McDonald's, which was the only thing open, NBC reported. Alone: One passenger said that airport staff seemed ill-prepared for the cancellation in the storm . Anticipation: The passengers can be seen waiting for their plane - but it was unable to go due to the snow . Stuck: The airline said they were 'doing everything' they could to help passengers - including providing coupons for food and blankets . 'I have friends who will come get me but they can't because the roads are closed,' he said. 'It was hopeful, hopeful, hopeful right up until the last minute with the most crushing final defeat of horror.' Helena Shackleton, from Yorkshire, was trying to fly home from a bachelorette party in New York. 'People were really frustrated', she told NBC News. 'Our luggage is still on there because they said there is no one qualified to take it off. It's a complete disaster.' In a statement, the airline said that they were 'doing everything' they could to help passengers and have provided them with meal vouchers and blankets in the airport. 'The aircraft was due to depart when a passenger required urgent medical attention and returned to the terminal,' it said. 'Subsequently we de-iced the aircraft again and unfortunately it then developed a minor technical issue. Once this issue had been rectified, unfortunately the bad weather combined with the cabin crew running out of hours meant the aircraft was unable to take off. 'Due to the severe weather in the region, there is a road travel ban and therefore customers are unable to leave the airport. We are working very closely with the airport authorities in order to minimise the disruption and we will continue to monitor the weather conditions closely.' It added that they hope the plane will fly tonight at 6.30pm, depending on weather conditions. Stranded: In LaGuardia Airport in New York, stranded travelers were supplied with cots so they could sleep . Covered: A passenger's photo shows snowplows as they try to clear the runways at LaGuardia Airport . Miserable: Passengers wait for updates after their flights were canceled amid the snowstorm . In a separate incident, British travelers David and Catherine Haycock, both 37, were nearly stranded after their taxi to JFK airport got a puncture. The couple, from Manchester, England, managed to book themselves on to a different flight to Heathrow. 'It was like a disaster movie at JFK,' Mr Haycock told the London Evening Standard. 'We managed to get the 6.20pm to Heathrow but it took ages to wait to have the ice blown off the plane.' On Tuesday morning, blanket driving bans were lifted in New York and across New Jersey after the storm, dubbed Juno, failed to live up to its threat. The storm had threatened to dump 36 inches (3ft) of snow and emergencies were declared in seven states, but by early today, forecasters downgraded most of their numbers, saying New England would fare the worst, but even then not as bad as expected. As of 5am ET (10am GMT) nearly 9ins had fallen in parts of Long Island, while Central Park had just six inches, prompting the National Weather Service to lift the blizzard warning for the city. Avoided the worst: The storm had threatened to sump three feet of snow on several states - including New York (pictured) - but the looming super blizzard never materialized .

"Most scuba divers want to stay as far away from the gaping jaws of crocodiles as possible, but a pair of British photographers got close enough to one beast's teeth to be its dentists. Nick Robertson-Brown, 62, and his wife Caroline, 41, took close-up pictures of Niño the crocodile in December 2014 at Jardines de la Reina, Cuba. Taken just inches from the jaws of the reptile, the photographs show the stunning beauty of the three-metre deadly predator, whose name means little boy in Spanish. Scroll down for video . Nick and Caroline Robertson-Brown took close-up pictures of Niño, an American crocodile, on a trip to Jardines de la Reina, Cuba . The photographers, from Manchester, were careful not to startle the animal when getting close enough to capture the details of its teeth . The pair, from Manchester, England, were accompanied on their journey by guide Gustavo, who made calls to Niño on a trip through the government-protected mangrove forest. The American crocodile then swam out of the trees to see them - allowing the Robertson-Browns to capture the extraordinary pictures. Avalon Cuban Diving Centers' guides have been working with Niño since he was very small, so he is now quite used to photographers getting close. The photographers, who were outfitted in scuba gear, were able to stand in shallow water  during the encounter as they shot photos of the animal as it waded among the sea plants of its natural habitat. The husband and wife team, who have been working together for 12 years as dive instructors and underwater photographers, said that the shallow water proved a challenging environment. 'The sediment very easy to stir up, so it was hard to get into position to get  shots, without disturbing the croc,' the pair said on their Facebook page. Avalon Cuban Diving Centers regularly take trips out to the mangrove swamps to see crocodiles, who have been exposed to photographers since an early age . Only 700 divers per year are allowed to go to Jardines de la Reina, which is seven hours by bus and a six-hour boat ride from capital Havana . While the water was in danger of becoming murky, the stunning images show detailed images of Niño's snout as it cut through the swamp. Mr Robertson-Brown said: 'We got into the water with the croc and got so close his teeth were almost touching our camera housings. Though Niño is used to attention, the British snappers were wary of being snapped at suddenly by the scaly swimmer. 'It is a wild animal, so you have to be very careful, moving slowly and smoothly in the water so as not to startle or scare the croc.' The Robertson-Browns were worried that the sediment in the shallow water would make their pictures murky and limit the detail of the croc . Guide Gustavo helped lure the crocodile over to the photographers in scuba gear so that they could capture the amazing images of Niño . 'Whilst we never felt in danger, as the croc was moving in a very easy going way, it is still an amazing, adrenalin-filled experience,' Mr Robertson-Brown said. Only 700 divers are permitted to go each year to Jardines de la Reina, a national park that is a seven-hour bus ride and additional six-hour boat ride from Havana. Mr Robertson-Brown, who has also photographed fish, sharks and manatees, called the experience was 'well worth it' because of the 'pristine reefs and amazing animal encounters.' The pair said the Cuban expedition, during which they met Argentinean footballing legend Diego Maradona and photographed giant feral rats called jutías, was 'one of our most productive trips ever'. Mr Robertson-Brown said that he and his wife never felt in danger during the crocodile shoot, but added that it was 'still an amazing, adrenalin filled experience' The Robertson-Browns said the trip, during which they also photographed giant rats called jutías and met Diego Maradona, was one of their most productive . The Jardines de la Reina, is home to a wide variety of marine vegetation and wildlife, including sharks and giant groupers that can weigh up to 400 pounds . Jardines de la Reina, which means Gardens of the Queen in Spanish and were named by Christopher Columbus, is a roughly 675 square mile coral reef system about 60 miles off of Cuba's southern coast, according to Diver Magazine. The 250-island archipelago includes portions of reef and mangrove swamp that house animals including sharks, goliath groupers that can weigh up to 400 pounds, loggerhead turtles and American crocodiles such as Niño. American crocodiles, which live in the Caribbean from southern Florida to the north coast of South America, are listed as vulnerable by Red List. While the animal's skin is legally traded from some farms in Cuba, illegal hunters also target the crocodile for its hide. The American crocodile, which is labeled as vulnerable by conservationist group Red List, is illegally hunted for its thick scaly hide . The Robertson-Browns rode around the mangrove swamp in a small boat driven by guide Gustavo, allowing them to capture images both in and out of the water .

"Four stolen Range Rovers worth £250,000 were found squeezed like Tetris pieces into a 40ft container as thieves attempted to sneak them out of the country. Police officers discovered the stolen cargo at Tilbury port, Essex, where the luxury vehicles had been slotted together like puzzle pieces. One of the cars had been fitted with a specialised Tracker device, which led police to recover the entire stash of SUVs before they were shipped overseas. Four stolen Range Rovers worth £250,000 were found squeezed  into a 40ft container (pictured) as thieves attempted to sneak them out of the country . The secret tracker has no aerial, meaning a thief cannot seen where it has been hidden. But once it is activated, it emits an electronic signal that every police force in the country can follow. Exporting and selling stolen vehicles on the black market is a lucrative business for organised crime groups and police figures show that more than half are never recovered. The National Crime Agency says they recover stolen vehicles - which avoid tax or import duties - on a daily basis at UK ports. Tilbury has always been a major hotspot for that sort of crime, according to a spokesman for Tracker. Adrian Davenport, police liaison manager for Tracker, said the vehicles had been slotted together like Tetris pieces (pictured) But police figures suggest that, in order to avoid detection, criminal gangs are also turning to smaller, less familiar ports including Grangemouth in Scotland, Immingham or Killingholme in Lincolnshire. Adrian Davenport, the police liaison manager for Tracker, said: 'The Port of Tilbury, like other major UK ports, has always been a hotspot criminals use to get stolen vehicles out of the country. 'However, according to police, criminal gangs are now also using less familiar ports, such as Grangemouth, Immingham or Killingholme to ship high value vehicles out of the country. 'Official figures show 53 per cent of stolen vehicles are never recovered and this case shows us why, as criminals hide the vehicles and ship them. Tracker has worked with police in recovering stolen vehicles for twenty years. Currently, more than one million UK cars are fitted with their specialised tracking units. The trackers are used on cars, commercial vehicles, motorhomes and caravans or motorbikes. Mr Davenport added: 'We have just supplied additional police tracking equipment at strategic ports around the UK, so if a customer's brand new Range Rover Sport ends up dockside, there is an even greater chance we will pick it up before it leaves the country.'","Stolen cargo discovered by police in 40ft container at Tilbury port, Essex .

"A new implant could help the many people who struggle with standard hearing aids. Peter Kay, 70, a business consultant from Bramhall in Greater Manchester, had one fitted, as he tells CAROL DAVIS. THE PATIENT . Peter Kay, 70, from Bramhall in Greater Manchester . My first indication that I had a hearing problem was nearly 20 years ago when my wife, Olwyn, and I were on a summer holiday in Switzerland. I couldn't hear the crickets or the fact that I'd left our car indicators on - Olwyn had to tell me. Back home, my GP referred me for hearing tests at Wythenshawe Hospital, in Manchester - the audiologist confirmed I had age-related hearing loss, caused by the tiny hair cells in my inner ear dying off. These cells help transmit nerve signals to the brain. It happens to everyone, but can be worse in some families - my father had it severely in his 70s. I didn't need hearing aids straight away. But six months later, a test showed my hearing had worsened to the point where I needed one for my right ear and, six months after that, I had one fitted in my other ear as well. The hearing aids helped, but the plastic inserts felt strange, and the sound was distorted. And after five years, I began to suffer from severe infections caused by the hearing aids - they stopped oxygen getting into my ear, which meant bugs could flourish. I also developed eczema in my ear, and had to have skin and debris syringed out regularly. Every few months I was having steroid and antibiotic drops to get rid of the infection - changing hearing aids didn't help. And because I couldn't tolerate the hearing aids when my ears were infected, my hearing was still bad - Olwyn didn't like me going out alone, as I couldn't hear the cars. So, four years ago I was referred to Manchester Royal Infirmary where I saw Kevin Green, a consultant ear, nose and throat surgeon. He told me about a new implant called Vibrant Soundbridge that would boost the sound signals reaching my brain - this would involve having an operation to fit a special vibrating device, about the size of a grain of rice, to the tiny hearing bones in the middle ear. These bones move in response to sound and the vibrations are then transmitted to the hair cells - the extra stimulation from the implant would send stronger vibrations to my inner ear, to help my damaged hair cells function at their best without a hearing aid. I should also stop getting ear infections, too. A few weeks later, once the blood from the surgery had cleared, I would be fitted with external processors, held behind each ear with magnets, to pick up the sound. The new implant, Vibrant Soundbridge, boosts the sound signals reaching the brain . In August 2010, I had the three-hour operation to have the implant put in both ears. When I woke up I couldn't hear anything at all. This was very disconcerting, but I knew it was temporary - caused by the build-up of blood. Once I had the external processors fitted I could suddenly hear normal conversations again, which was great. Within four to five weeks I was able to listen to the TV at its normal volume - my hearing is almost as good as it was in my 30s. My eczema and skin infections have also gone. THE SURGEON . Kevin Green is consultant ENT surgeon at Manchester Royal Infirmary . More than 600,000 Britons have severe hearing loss. The most common is age-related, which affects everyone by their 60s or 70s. When we hear, soundwaves move through the ear canal and make the eardrum vibrate. The vibrations are passed via three tiny bones in the middle ear, to the inner ear. This contains a structure called the cochlea, which has thousands of tiny hair cells that convert the vibrations into nerve impulses which are carried to the brain. As we age, these hair cells become damaged and die. Peter, 70, pictured with wife Olwyn on their wedding in '67, says hearing is 'as good as it was in his 30s' For most people, small digital hearing aids - which work by amplifying sounds - will be effective. But some people suffer from repeated ear infections because the hearing aids block the ear canal. One alternative is a bone-anchored hearing aid, where a sound processor is attached to a screw in the skull. But some people don't like the idea of this. Also, this procedure works best for those with conductive hearing loss, when sound cannot pass freely to the inner ear, perhaps due to a blockage or a problem with the hearing bones. Until a decade ago there wasn't much more we could do for people with sensorineural hearing loss - caused by damage to the hair cells. This is where Vibrant Soundbridge comes in. It was developed in the U.S. around 20 years ago, but has only become widely used in the UK in recent years. As with a conventional hearing aid, the implant boosts hearing across all frequencies, including the high frequencies that people tend to lose first - women's voices and speech. It also uses sophisticated technology to cut down on background noise. Many people do well with hearing aids and don't need surgery, but this could help thousands of Britons with moderate to severe hearing loss who don't get on with hearing aids, including people with damage to their middle ear or inner ear. The operation takes 60 to 90 minutes under general anaesthetic. First, I make a 6-7cm incision behind the ear and drill a 3-4mm wide tunnel through the mastoid bone behind the ear to reach the middle ear. I then clip a vibrating device to the central bone in the middle ear. The vibrating device - called a transducer - is 2.3mm by 1.8mm and is like a tiny generator which vibrates. It has a wire wrapped around it - this wire runs to the other part of the implant which works like a radio receiver. I tuck this 'receiver' under the muscle and tissue close to the skull behind the ear, closing the incision with dissolvable stitches. This will transmit signals to the transducer. Once the blood from surgery has cleared, usually after two or three weeks, we use a magnet to attach an external audio processor to the skin, on the other side of the implant. This picks up sounds, which are transmitted to the receiver and onto the transducer, making it vibrate. The operation carries small risks including loss of hearing - potentially permanent - if we damage the delicate middle ear bones. There is also the risk of bruising the nerve supplying taste sensation - though this should ease after a few weeks - and damaging the facial nerve which runs through the mastoid bone, leading to temporary or permanent facial paralysis. But I'm delighted to see this operation worked well for Peter. It has transformed his life. ANY DRAWBACKS? As well as the risk of hearing loss and bruising to nerves, touching the hearing bones could lead to tinnitus, says Mike Pringle, consultant ENT surgeon at Portsmouth Hospitals NHS Trust. He says: 'Previously, patients with Soundbridge could not have an magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan because it was thought the magnetic charge would displace or demagnetise the implant. 'But recent experience has shown the risk is small. Overall, this is a great device which has stood the test of time for reliability and effectiveness.' The operation costs £12,000-£15,000 privately and £8,000-£10,000 to the NHS - it is available in 15 NHS and private centres.","Peter Kay, 70, from Bramhall, Greater Manchester, had the new implant .

"London has beaten cross-Channel rival Paris in the race to be Europe's most visited city in the latest research released by Euromonitor International. Great Britain's capital welcomed 16.8 million arrivals compared to their France counterpart's 15.2m in figures released revealing the international tourist arrivals. The top three cities on the top 100 list, Hong Kong, Singapore and Bangkok, remain unchanged from 2012 as they continue to benefit from bustling populations and close proximity to China. London recorded more arrivals from international tourists than Paris in Euromonitor's latest report . Paris had 15.2million visitors to be fifth in the top 100 cities for arrivals, but London was fourth with 16.8m . Hong Kong remains top of the top 100 visited cities, ahead of Singapore and Bangkok . Outbound travel from China is heavily influential for many of the cities listed, but tourists aren't flocking to China. However, the world's most populous nation does remain the leading country for the number of cities featured in the top 100 with a total of eight, according to the exhaustive statistics analysing travel in 2013. 1) Hong Kong, Hong Kong (25,587.3million) 2) Singapore, Singapore (22,455.4m) 3) Bangkok, Thailand (17,467.8m) 4) London, United Kingdom (16,784.1m) 5) Paris, France (15,200.0m) 6) Macau Macau 14,268.5m . 7) New York City 11,850.4m . 8) Shenzhen 11,702.5m . 9) Kuala Lumpur 11,182.4m . 10) Antalya 11,120.7m . Turkey features strongly in the list, with Antalya, Istanbul and Artvin all enjoying an increase in visitor from last year largely thanks to an influx of Russian arrivals. Antalya, which boasts beach destinations including Kemer, Alanya, Belek, Kas and Side, accounted for 75 per cent of all Russian visitors to Turkey who can enter the country without a visa if staying less than 60 days. Switzerland's largest city, Zurich, boasts one of Europe's highest growth rates for arrivals with a rise of 23.6 per cent - it welcomed 2.26m arrivals in 2013 with more Chinese and Russian visitors credited as the main reason. While Chinese and Russian travellers are having a huge impact on the list, Euromonitor believe the United States,  the second largest source for outbound travel in 2013, is the market to watch. Switzerland's  Zurich boasted a rise of 23.6 per cent due largely to an increase in Russian and Chinese arrivals . The US has been a relatively mature market with outbound travel peaking in 2007, followed by yearly declines until recovery began in 2012. But a better economic environment, a stronger dollar and lower gas prices will likely boost outbound travel from the US. 'Cities in neighboring countries to the US such as Central America, Mexico and the Caribbean will most likely see growth in US travelers,' says Euromonitor's Head of Travel and Tourism, Caroline Bremner. The Kremlin Palace Hotel rises above a beach in Turkey's Antalya, which is hugely popular with Russians . 'Western European cities will likely benefit too, thanks to strong cultural positioning and historical ties to the US.' The figures were released as the latest UNWTO World Tourism Barometer revealed international tourist arrivals reached 1,138 million in 2014, a 4.7 per cent increase on last year. Despite no countries from the Continent cracking the top three cities in terms of arrivals, Europe is the most visited region with over half of the world’s international tourists with a total of 588m visitors, an increase of 22m.","London had 16.8m arrivals compared to Paris's 15.2m in 2013 .

"Hundreds of sex offenders are escaping with slap-on-the-wrist punishments for ‘abhorrent’ crimes including grooming and assaulting children. Figures compiled by the Ministry of Justice reveal that perverts have been let off with cautions even when targeting those aged under 13. The law states that a child aged 12 or under is incapable of consenting to any sexual activity – with perpetrators facing a maximum 14 years in jail. But police have given out 437 cautions for the offence over the past five years. Let off: More than 400 cautions have been given to offenders for sex with under-13s (posed by model) The ‘soft’ punishment, sparing the offender a court appearance, is used in about one in six cases dealt with by the authorities. Police and prosecutors are also dealing lightly with those guilty of grooming children for sex, despite public outrage over gangs targeting vulnerable youngsters. Some 66 such crimes resulted in a caution between 2009 and 2013 – a shocking 18 per cent of the cases where action was taken. Campaigners and MPs said the revelations were ‘appalling’. Tory MP Philip Davies, who unearthed the figures, said paedophiles were being spared the ‘full force of the law’, adding: ‘It is completely unacceptable to give cautions for sexual activity with children under the age of 13. MP Philip Davies: 'It is completely unacceptable' 'There are no mitigating factors and no excuses. They should go before a judge.’ Peter Cuthbertson, of the Centre For Crime Prevention, said: ‘Even those well aware of how much cautions are being overused will be sickened. Cautions for major sex offences and paedophiles is completely unacceptable.’ The NSPCC said some decisions to issue a caution may have been taken to avoid a child having to give evidence in court. But it added that this was a damning indictment of the justice system. The charity’s Jon Brown said: ‘A custodial sentence for serious sexual offences sends a very clear message that society will not accept their behaviour in any way. It also reflects the lifelong damage that sexual abuse can have on children and young people. ‘A prison sentence can also mean the offender is given therapy to ensure they understand the impact of their behaviour and to reduce their risk of reoffending.’ There has long been controversy over the use of cautions for other types of sex offences. Figures released to Mr Davies, a campaigner against soft justice, show there were 7,057 such punishments in a five-year period. But the disclosure relating to those who have assaulted under-13s is particularly shocking. Normally, officials explain the use of cautions for sex crimes as applying in cases such as a 17-year-old having sex with a 14 or 15-year-old. Prosecutors may decide not to take the case to court because the act was consensual. Lib Dem justice minister Simon Hughes, who released the figures to Mr Davies, said: ‘All sexual offences are abhorrent.’ Mike Penning, Tory justice minister, said the law was now being changed to ban the use of cautions for serious sexual offences. He said: ‘Under this Government, sex offenders are more likely to be locked up, and for longer … we’ve banned the use of cautions for serious offences and we’re now enshrining this in law.’ In a speech earlier this week, Justice Secretary Chris Grayling said the number of sex offenders was one of the ‘biggest challenges’ facing the courts, with a ‘fairly rapid increase’ in the number in jails. He added: ‘More have been arriving in our prisons and they have been staying there for longer than the typical offender.’","Some 'soft' punishments may be to avoid children giving evidence at trial .

"Scientists have been attempting to create invisibility cloaks long before Harry Potter made it popular. But, because of the way they bend light, current designs have always tended to draw more attention to the object than they deflect. Now, a US researcher claims to have overcome this problem by integrating battery-powered devices into his design - and he claims an invisibility cloak will be created in his lifetime. Scroll down for video . The quest for a true invisibility cloak, seen in films such as Harry Potter (scene pictured), is the holy grail for physicists. But, because of the way they bend light, current designs have always tended to draw more attention to the object than they deflect . Hao Xin, a professor of electrical and computer engineering at the University of Arizona the technology could soon be used to conceal military airplanes and even people. His US Air Force-funded research is based on the use of porous plastic bowling balls and tiny copper wire circuit boards. These objects are put together in precise geometrical patterns to bend waves of energy in unnatural ways. In particular, they reveal a property called 'negative refraction', meaning they can bend a wave backwards. Courtesy of TEDx Talks . Metamaterials are synthetic materials engineered to have properties that have not yet been found in nature . Through a prism with negative refraction, a straw leaning in a glass of water would appear inverted. The quest for a true invisibility cloak, seen in films such as Harry Potter, is the holy grail for physicists. But while many have claimed to be able able to briefly conceal objects from view, and even shield sounds, one team has developed a way to cloak entire events. The say they managed to do this by concealing these events behind strands of laser light. The technique, called ‘temporal cloaking’ was developed at the Purdue University in West Lafayette using lasers and fibre optics. The researchers separated strands of frequencies in laser light before changing their respective height. They then sent this light through a fibre optic cable. By slowing the speed of photons on a particular strand, the intensity of the light was dropped to zero. This made that particular strand appear invisible, hidden behind or between other strands. Using this method, the light travelling in front of this strand was sped up, while the trailing part was slowed down to create a gap. The physicists then used this gap to insert hidden messages in data. During test, the hidden messages travelled along with the other frequencies, but arrived at the other end marginally out of sync with the photons surrounding it. It is called a spacetime cloak because the data is transported in a 'bubble of time.' The piece above the water's surface would appear below the water and leaning in the opposite direction. In a more futuristic scenario, a person looking at a person wearing a cloak with artificially designed refraction properties would see part or none of the person. This would, however, depend on the cloak's refractive index and whether the light bouncing off of it reached the viewer's eye. But metamaterials with this negative refraction have presented a vexing physics problem: They reduce the strength of the wave. 'One of the biggest problems with metamaterials is that they produce energy loss,' Professor Xin said. 'The waves decay as they pass through the artificial material. We have designed a metamaterial that retains negative refraction but does not diminish energy.' In fact, the synthetic material not only prevented energy loss - it caused energy gain, with the microwave intensifying in strength as it passed through the material. Professor Xin achieved this by embedding battery-powered tunnel diodes – which is a type of semiconductor device - and into the new material. 'Many people did not think it was possible to achieve energy gain along with negative refraction,' Professor Xin said. He first showed it was possible, with one-dimensional metamaterials, in a paper published in Physical Review Letters in 2011. His new findings, reported in Nature Communications, have broader implications, because they involve 3D metamaterials. Professor Xin said it will be years before fantastical applications like a Harry Potter-style invisibility cloaks would appear on the market. But he says his research is inherently practical, predicting: 'Invisibility cloaks will be a reality in my lifetime.'

"Stone Roses frontman Ian Brown has claimed that TV weatherman and former biology teacher Fred Talbot played his class gay porn when he was 11. The 51-year-old singer was taught by Talbot at Altrincham Grammar School in Manchester in the late 1970s and also told a court that he gave masturbation practice as homework. Talbot, 65, denies 10 offences of indecent assault on five boys while working as a teacher between the late 1960s and the early 1980s and is on trial at Minshull Street Crown Court in Manchester. Ian Brown, pictured as he is driven from court today after giving evidence in the trial of Fred Talbot, his former teacher. He claims the TV weatherman showed his class gay porn when they were 11-years-old . Wearing trainers, jeans and an open-necked shirt, Mr Brown said the all-boys grammar school was a violent place - but Talbot was one of the few teachers who did not physically hurt pupils. He told the court he remembered 'in particular' two or three biology lessons given by Talbot when he was an 11-year-old boy. 'Very early at school, I would not have been there a long time, Mr Talbot asked all the class if any of us had ever masturbated,' he said. 'We were 11 years old at the time.' Mr Brown continued: 'He went on to explain how to masturbate, how you should masturbate and the following lesson he asked who had masturbated.' TV weatherman Fred Talbot, 65, denies indecent assault at the trial being held at Minshull Crown Court (pictured arriving at court today) Neil Usher, prosecuting, asked if there was any response from the boys. 'Nervous giggles,' Mr Brown said. 'He wanted to know who was successful in the masturbation. He asked boys to raise the hand.' Mr Brown said in further biology lessons, Talbot would approach the boys who had raised their hands - the ones with 'bum fluff on their lips' - and have 'private words' and 'murmuring' in their ears. The witness continued: 'I can remember sitting there wondering, ""What is he saying to them?""' 'They were all the same age but they were a foot bigger than us.' Mr Brown, who attended the school between 1974 and 1979, then told the jury of a second memorable biology lesson with Talbot. He said the class went to the science block, but instead of the usual classroom went into another with a projector set up to show the class of 11-year-olds a film. Mr Brown said: 'A three minute film on a Super 8 projector, of a guy walking into a room dressed in denims, sits on bed, takes trousers down and masturbates. 'The film was about three minutes long. It was only a few years later I realised it was probably a gay porn film. It wasn't a sex education film. 'It was years later I realised it was wrong to show us that film.' Mr Usher asked how old the witness was at the time and the lead singer of the Manchester band, the Stone Roses, replied: 'Around 11. About the time you would have had sex education in school.' Mr Brown gave further evidence, much of which cannot be reported for legal reasons. Talbot became a TV regular on the floating weather map in Liverpool's Albert Dock for ITV's This Morning show after his teaching career had come to an 'abrupt end' in 1984. The jury heard he resigned his school job after allegedly propositioning a pupil at his home and the headmaster was informed.

Talbot became a TV regular on the floating weather map in Liverpool's Albert Dock for ITV's This Morning show after his teaching career had come to an 'abrupt end' in 1984 . But the court was told Talbot was a 'chancer' who used his 'boundless energy' and 'extrovert personality' to abuse some of the boys he taught, four of them teenage pupils. Talbot, of Bowdon, Cheshire, denies ten indecent assaults on boys as young as 14, dating back to 1969. The trial continues.

"A 51-year-old man allegedly forced an intoxicated 18-year-old woman to have sex with him after he told her he wouldn't kill her it she would 'go with it'. The teenager, who cannot be named, had been out with friends at a bar on Oxford Street in August 2013, and after leaving in a taxi with an unnamed man, was left lying on the side of street after she was sick in the vehicle. It is alleged that Joseph Stephen Rosenburg came up to her and put his hand up her dress, and followed her into Hyde Park where she went in an attempt to escape him. A Sydney court has heard that a 51-year-old man forced a teenager to have anal sex in Hyde Park . The 18-year-old lay down near a tree, suffering the effects of excessive alcohol, and was followed by Rosenburg who allegedly came up to her and began touching her. 'Are you going to kill me?' she allegedly asked him. 'No, I'm not going to kill you if you go with it,' he allegedly replied. Crown prosecutor Craig Patrick told Sydney's District Court on Tuesday that Rosenburg forced the teenager to perform oral and anal sex while she pleaded with him to stop. She allegedly sent her friends a series of illegible texts to her friends pleading for help, including 'I'm being tapes (sic), help'. Afterwards, the teenager called a friend to come pick her up, saying 'he has hurt me, he has hurt me. He raped me, he raped me'. The 18-year-old allegedly sent a series of illegible texts to her friends asking for help . The court heard the teenager had consumed excessive amounts of vodka after being sick in a taxi . Rosenburg was arrested in March 2014 with his DNA matching forensic samples found on her underwear, the court heard. Rosenburg's barrister Ken Averre said it wasn't disputed his client had oral sex with the teenager, but that the question of consent was in question. Mr Averre said that Rosenburg denied having anal sex with the 18-year-old. He now faces three counts of sexual intercourse without consent and three charges of indecent assault. The court heard that the teenager had left the club she was at with her friends in order to drink large amounts of vodka before returning heavily affected by alcohol. The trial continues.","A 51-year-old man allegedly forced a teenage girl to have anal and oral sex .

Bargain hunters can a historic property in the popular Dordogne region for less than €1million - £750,000, with better value on offer in less fashionable areas. One luxury property, which is available for less than £500,000 in Bordeaux features a 16th century castle on four hectares. This four bedroom house in the Dordogne has been reduced from £1.1m to £830,000 . This 17th century chateaux near Dijon has been fully restored and is wroth in the region of £2million . The property has seven bedrooms and six bathrooms, with a small cottage for the caretaker, an apartment for the gardener and a large wine cellar. Property expert Bruno de Saint-Exupery, director of the Emile Garcin estate agency told The Times: 'You can find chateaux with 500 square metres of living room in a good condition in the perigord for €800,000 to €900,000 today. Some prices have fallen 45 per cent since 2007.' It is estimated that there are 40,000 chateaux across France and due to a reduction in property prices combined with the general weakness of the Euro, British buyers have the opportunity to secure bargains. However, experts warned that local and national property taxes could have set back the new home owner anything between £20,000 and £80,000 a year. Patrick Besse, who has 136 properties on his books said: 'They are changing hands now because the children have gone abroad or because those who have stayed in France do not have the means to pay for their upkeep.' This chateaux near Bordeaux has a 8.5 hectare vineyard and separate cottage cost £2.3 million .","French property prices have dropped by 45 per cent since 2007 .

"A Utah couple and their three children who were found dead in their home last fall overdosed on drugs after the parents told friends and family they were worried about the apocalypse, authorities said Tuesday. Police also found old letters written by the mother to a Utah inmate serving time for killing family members in the name of God, slayings chronicled in the 2003 Jon Krakauer book ‘Under the Banner of Heaven.’ Benjamin and Kristi Strack and three of their children, Benson, 14, Emery, 12, and Zion, 11, were found dead surrounded by cups inside their Springville home the night of September 27. On Tuesday, Springville Police Chief J. Scott Finlayson said authorities have concluded their investigation into the deaths and said the cause was 'drug toxicity'. Scroll down for video . Tragedy: Benjamin and Kristi Strack and three of their children, Benson, 14, Emery, 12, and Zion, 11, were found dead inside their home in September. Their oldest son, who survived, is pictured left . Announcement: On Tuesday, Springville Police Chief J. Scott Finlayson said the investigation into their deaths has now concluded and that it appears the parents killed themselves and murdered their children . Mr Strack had high levels of heroin in his system, while his wife had methadone, dextrorphan, diphenhydramine and doxylamine in her system, and both deaths were ruled as suicides. All three children died from diphenhydramine and methadone; the two youngest children's deaths were ruled homicides, but the chief said Benson's manner of death 'could not be determined'. But authorities believe he had been the last to die because he was on top of the bed, while his parents and siblings were under covers. Finlayson said there were no signs of a struggle and no suicide notes were found. Police said Benson wrote a goodbye letter, leaving some of his belongings to his best friend. The only other recent writing the family left behind was a notebook containing handwritten to-do lists about feeding the pets and other chores. Finlayson said interviews with people who knew the Stracks indicated the parents were worried about evil in the world and wanted to escape from ‘impending doom.’ ‘There seemed to be a concern about a pending apocalypse that the parents bought into,’ Finlayson said. ‘While some friends though that suicide may have been, or could have been, included in their plans, others believed they were going to move somewhere and live off the grid.’ Interviews with people who knew the parents revealed the Stracks worried about a 'pending apocalypse' Dangerous pen pals: Investigators said Kristi Strack struck up a friendship with Dan Lafferty (left), who is serving a life sentence after being convicted of committing a double-murder motivated by religion with his brother Ron (right) in 1984 . During their investigation, police found years-old letters between Kristi Strack and Dan Lafferty, who is serving a life sentence after being convicted of committing a double-murder with his brother Ron. ‘Under the Banner of Heaven’ is about members of an offshoot of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, told through the true story of the Laffertys' crimes. The two killed their brother's wife and 15-month old daughter. Ron Lafferty is on death row after his conviction in the July 1984 slayings of his sister-in-law, Brenda Lafferty, and her baby in American Fork. He claimed to have had a religious revelation sanctioning the slayings because of the victim's resistance to his beliefs in polygamy. Investigators said Kristi Strack was deeply interested in the case and struck up a friendship with Dan Lafferty. ‘It was almost like he talked to her like one of his children,’ Lt. David Caron said. She and her husband both became close to him, and he had directed his remains to go to them after his death. They hadn't talked to him since 2008 and investigators do not believe the couple's beliefs came from Dan Lafferty, police Cpl. Greg Turnbow said. ‘He felt really sad they had committed suicide,’ Caron said. Benjamin Strack's brother Jacob said the final report from investigators wasn't surprising to relatives still mourning the family's deaths. Looking back, the connection to Dan Lafferty was a troubling sign about the couple's mental state, he said. Heartbreaking: Their bodies were found in a bed in the master bedroom by their eldest son and his girlfriend . Missed: Family members told authorities that the couple had spoken about wanting to escape from the 'impending doom'. A picture of the family is seen at a vigil in Provo, Utah in October . The Strack family's bodies, which were discovered by their oldest son and his girlfriend, were found in a bed surrounded by the bodies of their children, which were tucked in bedding up to their necks, according to search warrants released last year. 'Furthermore, with the placement of the bodies, it would appear somebody had to position the bodies after they were deceased,' detective Jeffery Ellsworth wrote. Investigators found several empty methadone bottles, 10 empty boxes of nighttime cold medicine and two boxes of allergy medicine in their garbage, along with a red liquid substance in Pepsi cups. They also found a pitcher of red juice, a purple bucket with yellow liquid, a bag of marijuana and other medications, including sleeping pills, inside the home. Kristi Strack was also found with an unidentified red liquid coming out of her mouth. She had last been seen alive at 6am that day by her son's girlfriend, who also lived in the home. Questions: Authorities could not determine if Benson (pictured), who was 14 at the time, had been killed or if he had taken his own life. He was the only one not under the covers, suggesting he had been the last to die . The girlfriend went back to sleep after talking with her, and the house was quiet when the older son, 18-year-old Janson, and his girlfriend left the house that afternoon. However, when they returned at 7pm and saw the house was still quiet even though all the cars were in the driveway, they knocked on the master bedroom door. When no one answered, the couple called Kristi Strack's mother and her friend, who helped them to force it open. In a recording of the 911 call released Tuesday, family friend Maureen Ledbetter tells the dispatcher about the deaths as grandmother Valerie Sudweeks screams in the background. The methadone used in the deaths was prescribed to Kristi Strack, police said. Court records show Benjamin and Kristi Strack had a history of legal and financial problems and had gone through court-ordered drug treatment several years ago. Investigators said they weren't aware of any contact with state child services workers. Benjamin Strack's boss, bricklaying company owner Alex Short, has said it appeared those troubles were behind them.","Benjamin and Kristi Strack and three of their children, aged 11, 12, and 14, were found dead inside their Springville home on September 27 .

"Celtic manager Ronny Deila has hit out at Scottish Football Association disciplinary rules after Aleksandar Tonev's seven-match ban for racist language was upheld. Tonev was described as neither a credible nor a reliable witness by an SFA-appointed judicial panel in a report that was published following the failure of his appeal. The report revealed Aberdeen defender Shay Logan had accused Tonev of calling him a 'black c***' during a Scottish Premiership match on September 13 and the panel found the on-loan Aston Villa winger guilty after describing the Dons player as an 'impressive witness'. Celtic manager Ronny Deila hit out at the SFA's decision to uphold Aleksandar Tonev's (left) seven-match ban . Deila (left) said that Celtic supports on-loan winger Tonev (right) as there is no real proof of racist language . The SFA's disciplinary rules, like civil court cases, do not require that guilt be established beyond reasonable doubt, unlike criminal cases. The criteria for finding Tonev guilty was summed up in the report as 'it is more likely than not that the subject of the complaint committed the act of misconduct alleged'. But Deila feels more proof was needed - no one else heard the offending words, although Logan quickly told others. The Norwegian said: 'You can't judge a person on word against word, in my opinion. You will never do that in any real court. 'There is no proof and we still believe him. We will continue to do that when we don't have any other proof. 'You call another person a racist just on a word? I can't understand this happening. 'For me, if you are going to judge someone you have to do it with real proof and not word against word. Because a Bulgarian guy, with not very good English, is going to defend himself? Not so easy.' Celtic vowed to address issues raised in the proceedings with the SFA but there appears to be no recourse for challenging the decision again. 'I don't think there is any possibility to go further,' Deila said. 'We have to take the penalty but we still feel it is not right and we believe Aleksandar in full.' Celtic have consistently stood by Tonev and there appears little chance of him being returned to Aston Villa midway through his season-long loan. 'He still has a future here,' Deila said. 'Of course it is going to be difficult being seven games out but that's football. The most important thing is we stay behind him and support him. 'We are going to give him some days off to go to Bulgaria for Christmas and when he comes back he will be fighting to get back in the team. 'He is very disappointed of course but he moves on. He knows his innocence and he will just keep on going.' Aberdeen's Shay Long accused Tonev of calling him a 'black c***' in their game at Parkhead on September 13 . Celtic captain Scott Brown (centre) showed his support of Tonev and said his teammates stand by him . Deila insisted there had been no approaches for Kris Commons or Virgil van Dijk ahead of the transfer window . The damning nature of the report might make it difficult for Tonev when going to opposition grounds but Deila does not feel the player will be universally condemned. 'I think football fans are clever people as well,' he said. 'They can see behind the case and behind the results as well. I say we have to have proof.' And he feels the 24-year-old will still want to play in Scotland. 'I think so but I haven't talked a lot about this,' Deila said. 'But he is training well for the two days and he seems good.' Celtic skipper Scott Brown reaffirmed his support for his team-mate. 'We all stick by him, we know what happened and stuff like that,' Brown said. 'His training has been excellent, he has enjoyed training and there has been good banter with the lads as well. 'It's going to be hard, it's a long few games he is going to be out for but he will work in training, he will work on his fitness and when he's available he will be back in the squad. 'He has spoken to the players and we all stand by him.' There was more controversy in the SFA disciplinary procedures this week when Dundee United midfielder Paul Paton was banned for two games for spitting despite being publicly backed by his alleged victim, Aberdeen winger Jonny Hayes. The suspension rules Paton out of an awkward meeting with Celtic on Sunday as he awaits the procurator fiscal to consider charges against him for an alleged assault on Celtic goalkeeper Lukasz Zaluska. When asked about the issue, Deila said: 'I don't think we will use any energy on that. We are looking forward to the game and this is outside the pitch. 'I was at Dundee last weekend and they are very, very nice people. There is a good culture at that club. 'Again, we don't have any proof about that. It's a football game and we are looking forward to it.' Meanwhile, Deila insisted there had been no approaches for Kris Commons or Virgil van Dijk but confirmed he had taken 22-year-old Everton midfielder Francisco Junior on trial this week. The Guinea-born player was previously with Benfica and Manchester City and had a loan spell under Deila at Stromsgodset. 'He is a player I know from before,' Deila said. 'I haven't decided yet if he is going to stay for some more or he is going to go back.'","Aberdeen's Shay Logan accused Aleksandar Tonev of racist language .

"A man in a Florida news station's helicopter found a missing ten-year-old boy on Monday - and was able to tip off law enforcement on where to find him in the woods, local media reported. The boy is a Saturn Elementary School student and vanished near lunch, Brevard County school officials told WKMG. The CBS affiliate reported that one of its own photojournalists, David Sprung, was on the Sky 6 helicopter and discovered the boy's ground position. Found: The missing 10-year-old was seen by a WKMG helicopter on Monday after he went missing from his elementary school . Making a break for it: The boy is a Saturn Elementary School student and has said he was 'running away from school' 'Normally people don't like Mondays... I now like Mondays,' Sprung told WKMG. 'This has been the absolute best day of my life since I've been doing news.' Indeed, the Brevard County Sheriff Wayne Ivey Office said in a Monday release 'This afternoon, Deputies responded to Saturn Elementary School after School Administrators reported the child had left the campus. The administrators advised the child has existing medical conditions and was not in possession of required medications. 'Aviation Units, K9 Units, and Agents from the Brevard County Sheriff's Office immediately responded to assist in the search. During the efforts, Media Helicopters also responded to the area and assisted in trying to help locate the missing child. 'Dave Sprung, a media helicopter pilot with WKMG Orlando subsequently spotted the child deep in the woods in the area of the school and alerted the Sheriff's Aviation Unit.' Eagle eye: David Sprung, pictured, was in the Sky 6 helicopter when he noticed the boy down below . Discovery: Sheriff's deputies are seen collecting the boy in the woods on Monday . The boy later told WKMG while in a stretcher after deputies collected him that he had been 'running away from school.' 'Upon recovery the child was medically evaluated by Brevard County Fire Rescue and determined to be fatigued, but otherwise unharmed,' Ivey said in the release. 'Deputies safely assisted the child out of the woods where he was united with his family.' Brevard County Sheriff's Office spokesman Cpl. David Jacobs told Daily Mail Online the sheriff's office received a call about the boy at 12:19pm. Deputies were dispatched one minute later, with the first deputy arriving at 12:23pm, Jacobs said. The news helicopter observed the boy at 1:40pm, and deputies got to his location 17 minutes later, Jacobs said. The boy was 200 yards into the woods, and it took deputies 26 minutes to get out of the woods due to heavy brush, Jacobs told Daily Mail Online. Brevard Public Schools spokeswoman Michelle Irwin told Florida Today 'A lunchtime supervision plan is in place so students are monitored consistently,' and mentioned a student of conduct and check-out procedures. Irwin told Daily Mail Online she was deferring to the BCSO report, and said 'We were advised that the student left campus at lunch (approximately 12:30). The teacher on duty saw him leave and immediately contacted school administrators. They in turn contacted BCSO and the family.'","A man in a Florida news station's helicopter found a missing ten-year-old boy - and was able to tip off law enforcement on where to find him .

"A pensioner had a finger cut off and was thrown down the stairs by his balaclava-wearing grandson during a botched burglary. Barry Sibley was woken by the sound of intruders at his home and confronted them with a souvenir Gurkha’s knife. However, in a 'ferocious and sickening' struggle, the two intruders wrestled the knife out of Mr Sibley's hands and turned it on him, slicing off the middle finger of his left hand and almost severing his ring finger. The 82-year-old was then pushed down the stairs before the pair followed him, stabbed him in the chest and ‘chopped’ about his head with the ornamental kukri. They fled empty-handed. A police investigation revealed the retired policeman’s grandson, Jack Sibley, 21, and an accomplice, 22-year-old Warren Reid, were behind the raid. Barry Sibley had the middle finger of his left hand sliced off (pictured) by his grandson Jack Sibley and accomplice Warren Reid during a robbery at his home . Jack Sibley and Warren Reid planned to rob Sibley's grandfather Barry and spend the proceeds in a strip club . The pair broke into Mr Sibley's home in Cheshunt in May 2014 and subjected him to a terrifying ordeal . His mother Lorraine, Mr Sibley's daughter-in-law, received a 12 month sentence after lying to police about how her son had cut his hand. Sibley and his accomplice planned to steal £4,000 from a safe kept in an upstairs wardrobe before going on a spending spree which included visiting a strip club. Sibley – who visited his grandfather in hospital after the attack - has now been jailed for 19 years. Warren Reid, 22, was given 19 years and nine months. Both blamed each other for the horrific injuries Mr Sibley suffered. Surgeons were unable to re-attach the severed finger but saved the other one. He was in hospital for about a week. Mr Sibley, who has six grandchildren told The Mirror: 'Jack visited me in hospital with his family. He didn't say a word to me - he just sat at the bottom of my bed. 'At that time I didn't know it was him so it came as a surprise when police told me. That was very callous. He was trying to prove he was innocent by visiting me in hospital. I'm glad he's going to jail for a long time, at least I should be able to sleep safely.' He added: 'I have had no contact with him and he hasn't apologised. Apparently Jack sent a letter to the judge saying how sorry he was but I diddn't receive anything. I haven't forgiven him. They left me for dead.' A friend said he was ‘shaken to the core’ by his ordeal in the early hours of May 13 last year and ‘gutted’ about the impact on his family. In a recorded interview played at St Albans Crown Court, the pensioner said: ‘Everywhere was in complete darkness. ‘I opened the bedroom door and stepped out onto the landing. These two people jumped me and the next thing I know there was a struggle and they wrenched the knife out of my hand. ‘The next thing I knew I was head first down the stairs. What happened after that was a complete blank until I came round at the bottom of the stairs.’ Mr Sibley, pictured, said he cannot forgive his grandson after he was 'left for dead' following the attack . St Alban's Crown Court, pictured, heard the pair made a 'reconnaissance mission' two days before the raid . Detectives quickly established Sibley, of Stevenage, and Reid, of Luton, had made a surprise visit to the house two days before the raid. Prosecutor Michael Speak told the jury it was actually a ‘reconnaissance’ mission. Sibley kept his grandfather occupied while his partner crept upstairs. Text messages on the men’s phones revealed they were planning the burglary and that they intended using some of the proceeds on the strip club in Luton. They had also visited websites to gather information about unlocking combination safes. On the night of the burglary the men let themselves in with a spare key Sibley had and were creeping upstairs when they woke his grandfather. Mr Sibley also suffered a fractured skull in the attack. His cries for help were heard by a neighbour and police broke into the property where they found him lying in a pool of blood. Both men were convicted of conspiring to rob in a trial that ended last month. They had already admitted conspiracy to burgle. They were acquitted of attempted murder but found guilty of causing grievous bodily harm with intent. Both were also convicted of attempting to pervert the course of justice – Reid for hiding a knife and Sibley for burning the balaclava and gloves he wore. They were sentenced last Friday but reporting was prevented until yesterday for legal reasons. Judge Stephen Gullick told them: ‘He [Mr Sibley] was disarmed of the knife and such was the force of the struggle that, in the course of his resistance, one finger on his left hand was traumatically amputated and another finger was almost severed. ‘He was then propelled head-first down the stairs. The two of you followed. ‘One of you had the knife. Which one of you it was, only you know since each of you has always blamed the other for what occurred thereafter. ‘The jury concluded that what happened was the product of a joint enterprise by the pair of you for which you were equally responsible.’ Sibley’s mother, Lorraine, 48, was also jailed for 12 months after lying to police about cuts on his hand. The teaching assistant claimed they were caused by broken glass in her home. The court heard her 23-year marriage to her husband Alan – Mr Sibley’s son – had ended as a result.","Jack Sibley and Warren Reid were both jailed for 19 years over the raid .

"Stars with a £133,000 Aston Martin have been told to return their vehicles over concerns that a fault in the heated seats could burn their bottoms. The warning relates to thousands of the luxury supercars in the UK built over the last eight years, including the DB9 and DBS models often used by celebrities and footballers. A safety alert warns drivers that a control mechanism for the front heated seats ‘may fail when the ignition is switched on’ and that this could lead to burns in ‘extreme circumstances’. A safety warning has been issued for Aston Martin supercars. The recall affects the DBS model, used by Daniel Craig (pictured) in the James Bond films Quantum of Solace and Casino Royale . Aston Martin drivers have been told to return their vehicles amid concerns a fault in the heated seats could burn their bottoms. Footballer Frank Lampard (pictured) has been seen driving an Aston Martin DB9 in the past . Celebrities believed to be fans of Aston Martins include footballer Frank Lampard, who has been pictured with a DB9 and Steven Gerrard’s wife Alex Curran. The recall also affects the DBS model, used by Daniel Craig in the James Bond films Quantum of Solace and Casino Royale. Footballers Gareth Barry, Glen Johnson, Peter Crouch and James Milner are also believed to be fans of the sports cars. A recall notice on the European Commission website says: ‘The control module for the front heated seats may fail when the ignition is switched on. ‘This could allow a permanent feed to the seat heater element(s) and it may not be possible to switch off the heating. Alex Curran (pictured), the wife of former England captain Steven Gerrard, has been seen driving an Aston Martin DBS . ‘This fault could cause the seat to overheat and in extreme circumstances the seat occupants may receive burns.’ According to the Sun, the warning relates to nearly 8,300 Aston Martins in Britain with the fault reported to be in cars built between June 15, 2006 and November 6, 2014. But this did not include the four-door Rapide, Rapide S and a newer version of the Vanquish. The newspaper quotes a company spokesman as saying that the recall is ‘well underway’. It is not the first time a recall has been issued for Aston Martin vehicles. Daniel Craig is pictured as James Bond at the wheel of an Aston Martin DBS in the 2008 film Quantum of Solace . Last year, a notice was sent out recalling most of its sports cars built since late 2007 after it was revealed that a Chinese sub-supplier was using counterfeit plastic material in a part supplied to the luxury sports carmaker. Aston Martin, which is owned by Kuwaiti and private equity investors, recalled 17,590 cars, including all of its left-hand-drive models built since November 2007 and all right-hand-drive models built since May 2012, affecting about 75 percent of all vehicles built in that period, a spokeswoman said at the time. The Vanquish was not affected. MailOnline has contacted Aston Martin for further comment this morning. A spokesman from Aston Martin has said that the recall is ‘well underway'.

"An 'unnatural' coalition government formed on Monday between anti-austerity party Syriza and nationalist Independent Greeks could prove short-lived, analysts said. Syriza are the first anti-austerity party to govern in Europe, but they fell two seats short of a 151-seat majority in parliament and thus needed an ally. Syriza's 40-year-old leader Alexis Tsipras opted to cooperate with the Independent Greeks (ANEL), a party just as determined as his own to dump the austerity policies imposed over the past five years in return for a 240-billion-euro (£178billion) EU-IMF bailout. Scroll down for video . Alexis Tsipras (right), leader of radical leftist SYRIZA party, meets with Independent Greeks (ANEL) leader Panos Kammenos (left) during the process of the formation of a new government, in Athens, on Monday . Supporters of Germany's left-wing Die Linke party, hold placards as they show their support to Alexis Tsipras, leader of Syriza left-wing party. The placard, centre, reads in German: 'This is really a goodnight Mrs Merkel' referring to the German Chancellor, and the one on the right reads: 'I support Syriza, Die Linke' But analysts note that ANEL - best-known for vitriolic attacks on Germany - are unpredictable at best, and governing with them could also disrupt the balance among the various left-wing factions that make up Syriza. The radical leftists are already heading for a confrontation with Greece's international creditors over their insistence on renegotiating the bailout deal and having most of the country's enormous debt written off. Should the coalition falter, Greece could be forced into another election, paralysing the still-struggling economy and potentially plunging the eurozone into fresh instability. 'Syriza is made up of groups espousing different ideologies and Tsipras will have to seek a compromise inside his party, which is difficult,' said Manos Papazoglou, a professor of political science at Peloponnese University. 'This is a strange and unnatural alliance,' he told AFP, adding: 'The truth about the government's cohesion will be revealed when they sit at the negotiating table in Europe.' Syriza and ANEL were brought closer in recent years by their common opposition to the EU-IMF bailout, which forced sweeping spending cuts on Greeks and deepened a painful six-year recession. Coverage of Syriza's win on the front pages of Greek newspapers in Omonoia Square, Athens, Greece . But they could not be further apart on other key issues such as immigration and civil rights. Syriza want to soften Greece's stance on migrants and asylum-seekers, while ANEL are close to the influential Orthodox Church and want to take a strong stance against neighbouring Turkey, Macedonia and Albania. 'The two movements have nothing else in common (except the bailout). This is not an auspicious start,' said University of Crete political scientist Manolis Alexakis. 'The government's cohesion will be tested on a daily basis... power unites, of course, but I can't imagine certain people inside Syriza will be very happy with this (alliance),' he added. ANEL leader Panos Kammenos, 49, is a volatile ex-conservative lawmaker who abandoned the New Democracy party in 2012 after it approved the EU-IMF bailout, forming his own movement. He has often called Greece's creditors 'foreign conquerors' but wants the country to keep the euro. 'A coalition with ANEL could raise the risks of a big clash with Europe... ANEL is often seen as a group with a grudge,' said Berenberg bank analyst Holger Schmieding. Kammenos has termed the previous government a 'dictatorship' and said officials who signed the loan agreement should be put on trial. Syriza's leader Alexis Tsipras (right) shakes hands with Greece's President Karolos Papoulias (left) as he is sworn in as Greek Prime Minister at the Presidential Palace in Athens on Monday . 'We do not consider ANEL an anti-European party. Unless of course it's pro-European to bow to the demands of (German Chancellor Angela) Merkel and (German Finance Minister Wolfgang) Schaeuble,' Yiannis Balafas, a member of Syriza's political committee, told Alpha TV. 'Greece should be seen as an equal partner in Europe, not as a tenant,' he said. There had been expectations that Syriza would ally itself with To Potami, a new pro-European party that won 17 seats in the election. Alexakis, of the University of Crete, argued that ANEL could be an expendable asset for Syriza, to be cast aside once negotiations with the rest of Europe are over. 'Once the balance (in Europe) changes they could say 'goodbye' and seek an alliance with To Potami... or hold new elections hoping for a better score,' he said. Renewed fears that Greece could be forced out of the eurozone if it defaults on its debt repayments saw the euro hit an 11-year low against the dollar Monday, while Greek stocks closed down more than three percent. The IMF extended an olive branch to the new Greek government, saying it was prepared to continue its financial support to the country. 'We stand ready to continue supporting Greece, and look forward to discussions with the new government,' IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde said in a statement. However, EU Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker warned that Greece cannot expect any reduction in its huge debt commitments. 'There is no urgent need for action' on Greece's debt, Juncker told German television station ARD, adding that a reduction 'is not on the radar'. Many Greeks were optimistic that the fortunes of a country mired in deep recession were about to change for the better. Nikos, a Syriza supporter in Athens, said: 'Today is a very good day. I believe things will go well for our country.' But others were sceptical. 'There are many promises, but at the end there will be nothing. They only want power,' said Athina Mantsinou as she walked through the capital's Syntagma Square - scene of many demonstrations against austerity. In a sign of the mammoth challenge ahead, the EU issued a stern statement that Greece will risk its place in the eurozone if it fails to meet its austerity and debt commitments. From Brussels to Berlin, officials said they were open to talks with the new team in Athens, but many signalled its proposals were unrealistic. In exchange for the bailout in 2010, Greece was forced to slash public-sector spending, cut wages and pensions and introduce a far-reaching programme of privatisation. Syriza has pledged to reverse many of those measures. But Chancellor Angela Merkel of European paymaster Germany made her views clear. 'In our view it is important for the new government to take action to foster Greece's continued economic recovery,' her spokesman Steffen Seibert said. 'That also means Greece sticking to its previous commitments.'

Sunday's poll was Greece's fourth in five turbulent years, including back-to-back votes in 2012. During that time the economy has shrunk by a quarter and unemployment has soared beyond 25 percent. Syriza's victory could inspire other anti-austerity parties in Europe, including Spain's Podemos, which has topped several opinion polls and is aiming for an absolute majority in the Spanish election in November. 'Our victory is also a victory for all European peoples fighting against austerity that is destroying our common European future,' Tsipras told supporters Sunday. British finance minister George Osborne  said what Syriza was proposing was 'incompatible with what the eurozone currently demands of its members'. However, British Prime Minister David Cameron issued a warmer statement late Monday, congratulating Tsipras and welcoming his 'intention to tackle corruption and increase tax transparency across Greece'. Other European countries also said they were prepared to work with the new Greek government. French President Francois Hollande invited Tsipras to Paris and Spain's conservative Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy said he hoped the victory would lead to a 'stable government'. Italy saw the Greek result as possibly helping its push for greater flexibility in the EU's approach to budgets and broader economic issues, Foreign Minister Paolo Gentiloni said. Martin Schulz, the president of the European Parliament, will meet Tsipras in Athens on Thursday, Syriza said in a statement, the first visit paid by a foreign dignitary to the new prime minister since his victory. In Washington, the White House said it hoped to work closely with the new government and would continue 'to support international efforts to foster Greece's economic recovery'. 'There are indications that the economy is poised for renewed growth, but many challenges remain,' State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said.","Left-wing Syriza are the first anti-austerity party to govern in Europe .
