"It’s a game that almost every single Australian has innocently played– but it’s an activity that kills within seconds. Shallow Water Blackout is the number one killer of the most competent, fit swimmers – and it affects anyone holding their breath underwater, resulting in death  without warning. It takes place when the swimmer loses consciousness due to a severe lack of oxygen to the brain. It only takes two minutes for death to occur – whereas regular drowning takes six to eight minutes. There is a dangerous lack of education and understand about the dangers of breath-holding – a silent killer which is a commonplace activity amongst Aussie children, elite swimmers and snorkellers, a 60 minutes report investigates. In January last year, Jack MacMillan was just 12 years old - a water-loving, fit and competitive swimmer, when he died in his backyard pool in less than one metre of water. Scroll down for video . In January last year, Jack MacMillan was just 12 years old - a water-loving, fit and competitive swimmer, when he died in his backyard pool in less than one metre of water . This is the pool where Jack died, in less than a metre of water in the pool's shallow end with his mother less than ten metres away . He had swum almost every day of the summer holidays and was excited to start high school in two day’s time. ‘He just loved being in the pool,' his mother Michelle MacMillan told 60 minutes. ‘He’d just go lap after lap after lap. Holding his breath, challenging himself to see how far, how many laps he can do. ‘Being a typical 12-year-old,’ recalled Jack’s mother Michelle MacMillan to 60 Minutes. She had been watching just metres away as he swam, holding his breath as he swam to try and beat his personal best. Jack's mother Michelle recalls how she ran to pull her son of the water and started CPR to try and revive Jack . Ms MacMillan's swift response was not enough to save her son from the effects of Shallow Water Blackout . Without any warning, he floated to the bottom of the pool and never regained consciousness, despite his mother Michelle and emergency crew’s hour-long efforts to resuscitate him. His mother had looked away for one to two minutes at most, and ran straight away to her son to drag him out of the pool and commence CPR. ‘I would have looked away momentarily, distracted by my baby in my arms,' said Ms MacMillan. 'I looked back and I saw him. He was at the shallow end of the pool, in metre-deep water, . 'He was just curled in the foetal position at the bottom of the pool.’ Ms MacMillan's swift response was not enough to save her son from the effects of Shallow Water Blackout. ‘I still don’t accept it, I still don’t understand it and I’ll never get over it,’ George MacMillan said of his son's tragic death . ‘I did everything I could to try and save him and that’s the hardest thing - in the end I just couldn’t,' said Ms MacMillan. A person on the brink of suffering a Shallow Water Blackout is totally unaware that they need to take a breath. ‘He was at the shallow end of the pool – he could have just stood up but he didn’t get the warning,’ said Jack’s father, George. Jack's parents had never heard of Shallow Water Blackouts and are now desperate to inform Australians about the deadly risks . Shallow Water Blackouts is a little-known condition and often deaths from SWB are incorrectly recorded as ‘drowning’ on coroner’s reports – as was Jack’s initially. Jack's parents had never heard of Shallow Water Blackouts and are now desperate to inform Australians about the deadly risks. ‘People have known about it since the 1950s, only written about it since 1986 and people have only been listening since 2000. It’s a long haul. Dr Tom Griffith. ‘It commonly affects the very competitive, type A personalities –the person who pushes themselves to the limit. ‘So they see how long they can hold their breath for, which is a recipe for disaster, particularly if they do it over and over and over again.’ Hypoxic drills involve underwater breath-holding and train the body to survive without taking a breath for extensive periods of time . Jack fit that description, according to his father, who describes his son as ‘a quiet achiever, he was determined to do his best at anything’ Hypoxic drills involve underwater breath-holding and train the body to survive without taking a breath for extensive periods of time. These drills, used by coaches to train elite swimmers and military trainers, can be deadly. A shallow blackout almost claimed the life of Emily Miles last month in suburban Perth, when she instantaneously lost consciousness during a hypoxic training session. ‘She sank in the blink of an eye,’ explained her father, Tony. ‘That image, the little body lifeless next to me. That was pretty traumatic. We got lucky.’ These drills, used by coaches to train elite swimmers and military trainers, can be deadly but remain a 'daily' part of swim training . The 12-year-old blacked out and was pulled unconscious from the pool. She describes feeling ‘out of breath’ and then waking when the oxygen mask was placed on her face. ‘We have no scientific evidence to say that breath holding enhances performance. We don’t know of the benefits so why are we doing it?’ Dr Griffith. Swimming Australia is reportedly aware of the risks but hypoxic drills are still a daily part of swim training, according to 60 minutes. ‘I don’t think Swimming Australia is encouraging any coach to do hypoxic training,’ Swimming Australia head coach Jacco Verhaeren . ‘These are guidelines to prevent and educate swimmers as much as possible from doing the wrong thing.’ The MacMillan family want people to know about the risks so nobody ever has to experience the loss that they have to live with everyday . 'Shallow Water Blackout Australia' has now been established to try and make a change – to raise awareness and education to save the lives of other children, who would otherwise be unaware of the dangers of Shallow Water Blackhout. The government commits more than $8 million a year to water safety but little is known about the dangers of Shallow Water Blackouts. The MacMillan family want people to know about the risks so nobody ever has to experience the loss that they have to live with everyday. ‘I still don’t accept it, I still don’t understand it and I’ll never get over it,’ George MacMillan said of his son's tragic death.","Jack MacMillan died aged 12 due to Shallow Water Blackout (SWB)

"Graduates who study at superior universities do not have a higher income than those who studied at a less distinguished technology university. Mapping Australian Higher Education, a new report from the Grattan Institute, reveals that earning a lot of money does not come from attending an elite universities, rather it is about choosing the correct university degree. Undergraduate students who graduate from a commerce degree at University of Technology Sydney or RMIT University will make $3.2 million during their career, the same amount one would earn if they graduated from University of Sydney or University of Melbourne, institutions that are considered to be more prestigious, Sydney Morning Herald reports. Earning a lot of money does not come from attending an elite universities, rather it is about choosing the correct university degree . These findings have not stopped the superior Group of Eight (Go8) universities from claiming their institutes have better performance rates and higher entrance scores. Times Higher Education Supplement's recent release ranked University of Sydney 60th and University of Melbourne 33rd among international institutions, while UTS was placed between 226 to 250 and RMIT not even ranked in the top 400. 'The starting salaries and career earnings results both suggest that research-based prestige is not particularly important in the Australian labour market, at least for bachelor degrees,' it reads in the report. 'The technology universities either do not rate or get low ratings in the research-driven international rankings, but their graduates earn as much as those from Group of Eight universities, which dominate research funding and rankings. 'Group of Eight universities get good results partly because they take students who would do well wherever they studied.' University of Sydney was ranked 60th among international institutions . UTS was placed between 226 to 250 among other universities on the Times Higher Education Supplement report . But the report also found that graduates from Go8 or technology universities do earn more than students who study at suburban or regional institutions. Those working for 40 years after graduating from commerce generally earn $200,00 more if they studied at a Go8 and technology university, disadvantaging regional graduations by 6 per cent when it comes to lifetime earnings. This follows this year's federal budget, after the government allowed the Group of Eight universities to charge any amount of money for a degree. But findings from the report indicates prestigious universities are not what it is important to get ahead. 'The report shows that when it comes to earnings, what you study matters more than where you study,' Grattan Institute higher education program director Andrew Norton said. 'Studying engineering at any university is likely to lead to a higher salary than studying arts at a sandstone university,' Mr Norton said. The report's findings are only applicable to undergraduates.

"Paedophile Stuart Hall threw his wedding ring into a prison pond after arguing with his wife on the telephone, it was claimed yesterday. And to make matters worse, after the 84-year-old had calmed down he then allegedly asked the prison's governor if the water could be dredged so he could retrieve the gold band. But his request was reportedly turned down. The claims were made by a former inmate of I Wing at HMP Wymott in Lancashire, where Hall is serving a five-year sentence for sex attacks on girls. Happier days: Stuart Hall at home with his wife Hazel in 1979. The paedophile threw his wedding ring into a prison pond after arguing with her on the phone, it has been claimed . Jail: The claims were made by a former inmate of I Wing at HMP Wymott (pictured) in Lancashire, where Hall is serving a five-year sentence for sex attacks on girls . The unnamed sex offender told the Manchester Evening News that former It's A Knockout presenter Hall threw a ‘paddy’, which was witnessed by fellow inmates. He said: ‘He had an argument with his wife on the phone. He took the ring off and threw it in the pond in a paddy. Everyone else thought it was hilarious but he was furious. He was slagging her off.’ The inmate added that it was not clear whether Hall had wanted the ring back because of a reconciliation with his 75-year-old wife Hazel, or simply because it was valuable. Mrs Hall still lives in the couple's £2million mansion in Wilmslow, Cheshire, and vowed to stand by her husband earlier this year amid rumours she was planning a divorce. Aerial view: The inmate at HMP Wymott (pictured from above) said it was not clear whether Hall had wanted the ring back because of a reconciliation with his 75-year-old wife Hazel, or simply because it was valuable . Father-of-two Hall was jailed for 30 months last year after he pleaded guilty to indecently assaulting 13 girls, aged between nine and 17, over a 20-year period. The inmate said that Hall (above) was an unpopular figure inside the prison and could be 'quite arrogant' He was sentenced to another two and a half years in prison in May for indecently assaulting an underage girl but was cleared of 15 counts of rape involving two women. Hall will not be eligible for release from prison until December 2015 because the two sentences will run consecutively. The inmate repeated claims that Hall had received preferential treatment at the jail, which houses 1,200 inmates on four wings, many of them sex offenders. He said Hall remained ‘blasé’ about his crimes, telling fellow inmates he was innocent and that he was ‘put in here for patting someone on the bum - it's ridiculous’. The inmate said that Hall was an unpopular figure inside the prison and could be ‘quite arrogant’. It was ‘common knowledge’ Hall was writing his autobiography while inside, he added. The Sunday Mirror reported in May that Hall had secured a cleaning job at the jail - prompting fellow inmates to shout ‘It's a muck-out’ as he does his rounds. The Prison Service has previously denied claims from another former inmate that Hall was receiving preferential treatment because he was a celebrity.","Hall, 84, asked HMP Wymott governor if water could be dredged from pond .

"A Fort Lewis mother of two fantasized about dismembering a seven-year-old girl while collecting child porn, federal prosecutors claim. Sarah Wales, 32, allegedly collected and distributed child rape photos while living at  Washington-based military installation Joint Base Lewis-McChord, where her partner was stationed, in 2013. She also reportedly used a Canadian instant messaging service to describe her fantasy of sexually assaulting a young girl, before killing her and dismembering her body. Military installation: Sarah Wales, 32, allegedly collected child rape photos and videos while living at Joint Base Lewis-McChord (pictured) - the Washington military base where her partner was stationed - in 2013 . Army: Joint Base Lewis-McChord is home to the U.S. military's I Corps and 62d Airlift Wing. The facility is an amalgamation of the Army's Fort Lewis (pictured in 2002) and the Air Force's McChord Force Air Base . Last Tuesday, Wales was arrested  in Spokane following a year-long investigation. She has been charged with three counts of distributing child pornography and one count of possessing it. The FBI began investigating Wales in June 2013 after the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children received a tip from the IM service that there were suspicious activities on Wales's account. They discovered she had been using the site to swap stories about children being raped and beaten, a court filing by an FBI agent with the South Sound Child Exploitation Task Force alleges. During the exchanges, Wales even told other users that she had sexually assaulted children, while trading pornographic images and videos of youngsters, it is claimed. Allegations: In addition to the porn charges, Wales also reportedly used a Canadian instant messaging service to describe her fantasy of raping a girl, before killing her and dismembering her body (file picture) In August 2013, Wales was interviewed by the FBI, who also searched her home at Fort Lewis. During the interviews, she told agents her online conversations were 'disgusting' but 'strictly role playing', according to charging papers obtained by the Seattle Post-Intelligencer. 'Wales stated that she received all her images containing child pornography from other members of the chat room,' an FBI agent told the court.. 'She then stored and traded these images to other chat room members.' Court: Wales has been charged with three counts of distributing child pornography and one count of possessing it.

"A grandmother has become Britain’s oldest banned driver at the age of 86 after being handed five speeding tickets. Norah Lawley was caught doing 48mph in a 30mph zone while driving her Ford Focus in March - her fifth speeding offence in four years. The retired primary headteacher had previously been caught breaking the speed limit on September 10 and December 5 last year, as well as August 7, 2011, and March 18, 2010. Norah Lawley, 86, was handed a six month driving ban after being caught doing 46mph in a 30mph zone in March - her fifth speeding offence in four years . Lawley, who has four children, five grandchildren and one great-grandchild, appeared at Worcester Magistrates' Court on Monday after getting 13 penalty points, meaning a court has to consider a ban. She pleaded guilty to speeding and Deputy District Judge David Noble banned her from the road for six months. The most recent speeding offence happened at 12.36pm on March 30 when Lawley was taking letters to a person after they were delivered to her home by mistake. The court heard she was flashed by a speed camera travelling at 48mph as she went on her errand in Upton, Worcester. The judge endorsed Lawley’s licence with four additional penalty points, fined her £200 and ordered her to pay a £20 victim surcharge and £85 costs. The mother-of-four, from Coombe Green, near Malvern, Worcester., was also ordered to re-take her driving test after she completed her ban. David Ollivere, defending, said a small disqualification would be sufficient, avoiding the need for a ban under the totting-up procedure. He said: 'Mrs Lawley lives in a remote and rural area with the nearest shop in Welland, Worcester, being four to five miles away.' He added that of her four children, only one of them lived nearby and that the son had to care for his wife who had a severe disability. Mr Ollivere said that if Lawley was banned she would be reliant on friends for transport. He added: 'For a short disqualification the situation would be manageable but for a longer period would prove somewhat unbearable.' Despite his pleas, the judge ruled her repeated law breaking warranted a ban. The DVLA has since confirmed Lawley is Britain’s oldest banned driver. Lawley's solicitor argued that a ban would make it difficult for the mother-of-four to visit her relatives, three of whom live a long way from her home - but the judge Worcester Magistrates' Court (pictured) ruled otherwise . According to official records the oldest person with at least 12 points on their licence is an 85-year-old man. The oldest person to have any points on their licence is a 103-year-old man, and the oldest woman with a single point on her licence is 102. Neighbours of Lawley, who lives in a £300,000 home, expressed their sympathy today. One said: 'This is yet another example of the courts using a sledgehammer to crack a nut. There are far worse drivers out there. 'We will rally round for Norah as much as we can and help her out as much as possible.' Speaking from her  home today, speeding gran Norah Lawley said she was 'ashamed' of her ban. She said: 'I don’t want everybody to know about it. I am quite ashamed. My solicitor has asked for it to be called again. He wasn’t happy with the result. I don’t know if it will but we will see. 'It is all a blur, a bad memory. Altogether I was caught three times in a year in the same place in Welland, coming through at more than 30mph. So I have to just put up with it. 'I have had my licence cancelled so I won’t be able to drive until after Christmas. It is just one of those things. I have got friends who will take me around thankfully.'","Great-grandmother Norah Lawley, 86,  banned from driving for six months .

"A teenage college student who has been charged with murdering all three members of his family has been described as an 'evil person' by the district attorney. Alan Hruby, 19, of Norman, Oklahoma, admitted to shooting his father, John Hruby, mother, Katherine 'Tinker' Hruby and younger sister Katherine, on Thursday night. Now, Stephens County District Attorney Jason Hicks is talking about what a frightening young man Alan is, and how little he seemed to care about what he did. Killer: Alan Hruby (center, with two friends) is being described as an 'evil person' by the district attorney after murdering his entire family . Bad seed: The college freshman (seen above at his prom) planned the killings according to the district attorney . No remorse: It is also said the young man, seen just days before the killing at University of Oklahoma, cried 'crocodile tears' when informed his family was dead . 'It was completely planned out,' Hicks said after filing the murder case. 'This kid is an evil person.' What's more, someone who saw Alan in Dallas, where he got a room at The Ritz-Carlton after killing his family while his school, University of Oklahoma, took on University of Texas in a football game nearby, said he acted completely normal. 'I did not travel with him. I just met him in Dallas. He was not acting weird at all,' Andrew P. Bormann, told The Oklahoman. 'Nothing that he said or did ever raised any suspicion from me. Every time I saw him on the weekend, he was happy and laughing and having a good time. Even early Monday morning, 1 a.m., he was laughing and joking with me as we were studying.' Alan even shared a photo of him and his friends in his hotel room on Sunday, the day before his family was discovered and three days after they were killed. Gone to soon: Alan's 17-year-old sister Katherine (above) was only a junior in high school . Booked: Prosecutors are having the teen held without bail and may consider the death penalty . Good people: His parents John and Tinker (above with daughter Katherine) had recently cut of Alan financially after he repeatedly stole from them and other family members . Hicks said that Alan cried 'crocodile tears' after authorities told him about his parents deaths, and was only upset he had been caught. The young man also seemed to make a point of saying he was at his dorm at The University of Oklahoma on Thursday night on both his Twitter and Instagram accounts, perhaps as a way to distance himself from the scene of the murder. Alibi: The young man shared a photo from his dorm room window on Thursday, the night his parents were killed, perhaps as an alibi . Tweet: he also went on Twitter to confirm his location, likely after getting home from shooting his mother, father and sister . Alan said he owed a loan shark $3,000 and was hoping to inherit the money he needed to pay this person by inheriting money. His parents had recently cut him off financially, and a search of his dorm room on Wednesday turned up multiple stolen checks. Hicks also said that Alan told investigators that after shooting his parents he threw the gun he used, along with a DVD from the home's security system, in a nearby lake. Getaway: The weekend after he killed his parents he stayed at The Ritz-Carlton in Dallas, who luxurious rooftop pool can be seen above . Feeling fine: People who saw him in Dallas say Alan (above at his high school graduation) acted 'normal' as he partied with friends . Socio-snap: Alan shared this photo of his friends hanging at The Ritz while his parents and sister laid dead and undiscovered in their home . Appearing in court  yesterday, Alan was described as 'soft spoken' and 'unsteady on his feet,' crying when he was denied bail by the judge. Prosecutors have said they will be considering the death penalty in this case. His next court hearing is scheduled for December 17 and he has been told to have a lawyer by December 2. Court records also show Duncan police had been investigating Alan since August because of evidence he had forged checks totaling $17,500. It is also being reported he assaulted his mother two years ago after an disagreement with money. Salt of the earth: His father John (above with wife Tinker) was a well known local newspaper publisher . Tragic loos: Tinker (left) was described as a 'great neighbor' while Katherine (right) was said to always have a smile on her face . Scne of the crime: Alan shot all three in their family home . And there's more. In a police affidavit filed in August, 2013 officers met with John after he suspected his son was using a credit card not belonging to him. According to  authorities they say they found several charges to the card from Europe, during the time Alan took a trip to Paris. He had previously ran afoul of the law earlier this year when he pleaded guilty to a charge of credit card theft. The credit card he stole belonged to his grandmother, Janice Hruby, according to a family friend. His father phoned the police and Alan pleaded guilty in January of this year and he was entered into a delayed sentencing program and was due to appear in court this November. As part of his punishment the court ordered him to pay restitution, undergo a substance abuse evaluation, attend drug and alcohol counseling and complete a cognitive behavior program. It is also believe he recently stole one of his mother's cards as well, or started one in her name without her knowledge. Vacation: Alan frequently posted photos of his trips, above in Paris . Italia: He also posted this snap of a trip to Rome . Big Apple: These two photos were taken in New York City, where he stayed at The Ritz-Carlton on central Park (left) and took a trip to the top of the Empire State Building . The boy liked to document his extravagant lifestyle, posting photos of his trips to Rome, Paris, London and New York City on his Instagram account. Oddly enough, he never seems to be with friends or family members on these trips, but rather always alone. His social media accounts also featured snaps of expensive watches and wallets and cars that may or may not have belonged to the troubled teen. 'It's sad. It's very shocking,' said a 21-year-old neighbor, who asked to remain unnamed, about the deaths. 'They were a good family. They would always help you out. If your car wouldn't start, they'd come over and jump it, or if your dog ran off they'd try to help you catch it. Just neighborly things.' People started getting concerned when John, 50, the publisher of the local paper, The Marlow Review, did not turn up for work on Friday morning. He also failed to cover the weekly high school football game, something he always does according to his employees. Materialistic: Alan also liked to show off his expensive purchases, sometimes in front of international landmarks for a classy touch, like this pic of an Omega watch in front of the Eiffel Tower . Not his: Here Alan snaps a pic in a car that is not his . Subtle: This photo of a drink catches a very expensive Louis Vuitton wallet at the bottom of the frame . 'At this time, The Marlow Review asks the general public for prayers following the tragic deaths of John Hruby, our publisher, his wife, Tinker, and their daughter, Katherine,' said John's colleagues in a statement. 'Our staff endeavors to continue to serve Marlow to the best of our ability going forward.' Meanwhile, friends and classmates of Katherine, 17, a volleyball player, held a vigil for her last night. 'She was such a good person and such good friend to all of us,' said teammate Carly Kirkand. 'She always had a smile on her face even when she had every reason not to. It's going to be hard because she was such a huge part of this team.'","John Hruby, his wife Katherine and their teenage daughter Katherine were found murdered in their home on Monday morning by their housekeeper .

"The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service on Monday proposed listing the African lion as threatened after a study showed the big cats were in danger of extinction in the foreseeable future. A listing as threatened under the U.S. Endangered Species Act would bar trafficking of the species as it faces dwindling habitat in Africa and more competition with humans. African lions, or Panthera leo leo, are found across a wide range in the continent, but about 70 percent, or 24,000, of them live in only 10 major strongholds, the service said in a statement. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is proposing to list the African lion as a vulnerable species in order to stave off what it called the species' decline into extinction in the 'foreseeable future' Experts estimate there are around 35,000 lions left in the wild. In 1980, that number was closer to 80,000. One major problem lions face is the rapid decimation of their food animals to feed humans. As they lose prey, they turn to livestock. Humans in turn kill the lions that prey on their livestock. Listing lions as vulnerable would bar trafficking of the species the US or by Americans. Listing the African lion as threatened 'will bring the full protections of U.S. law to lion conservation, allowing us to strengthen enforcement and monitoring of imports and international trade,' Fish and Wildlife Service Director Dan Ashe said. The main threats to the African lion are loss of habitat and of the animals lions prey on, and increased conflict with humans, the statement said. People and farming and grazing activities have expanded into lion habitat and protected areas, putting more livestock near the big cats. As hunters reduce the number of animals that lions feed on, lions kill more livestock, leading to retaliatory killings by humans. The Fish and Wildlife Service is also proposing a rule that would set up permits for the importation of sport-hunted lion trophies. Sport-hunting is not seen as a threat to the species, the statement said.

"At 34-year old woman face an agonizing decision as to whether she should keep her baby after being told she was pregnant at the same time as being diagnosed with breast cancer. Adele Rivas believed that she was too young to have breast cancer despite her mother having to fight the disease when she was in her 40s, but after finding a lump in her breast she went to hospital to have it looked at. After being diagnosed with stage two breast cancer, she received some news that she was completely unprepared for - that of a pregnancy. One-two punch: Adele Rivas underwent chemotherapy treatments while pregnant with her first son . Her rock: Adele says her husband Luis (right) helped her through the difficult days as she underwent chemo . Adele has a feeling she might have cancer because her mother contracted it when she was in her 40s, but she never dreamed that she would be pregnant as well because she had been declared infertile . The news seemed all the more remarkable because despite Mrs Rivas and her husbands attempts to have a baby, she had been told that she was infertile and was eve looking at adopting a child. Doctors quickly ordered an MRI scan, but Mrs Rivas, a physician's assistant, was hesitant knowing that the MRI could affect an early pregnancy. In the end, she decide to take a simple pregnancy test. ''A voice told me 'You're really in denial,' about cancer, Rivas recalled to ABC News. When a nurse came back after the test, she told Rivas it was likely positive but it was so early to be sure, they would have to wait another 48 hours for doctors to be completely sure.' I left that day not knowing if I was pregnant but knowing I have breast cancer,' she said. Rivas is not alone as one in 3,000 pregnant women will be diagnosed with breast cancer . Daddy's boy: The couple moved to Adele's mother's house to save money and for support . After doctors repeated the test to confirm she was pregnant there were still many other decisions to take - including big questions over whether she could even keep the baby whilst undergoing treatment for cancer. Shortly afterwards, Mrs Rivas came to Mt. Sinai hospital In New York to begin her treatment. 'The way that you treat it, really depends on a lot of factors including at what stage of the pregnancy [the cancer] is diagnosed,' said Weltz, a breast surgeon at the Dubin Breast Center at The Mount Sinai Hospital. 'The question that really arises for every aspect of the treatment is whether the breast cancer treatment is compromising the safety of the pregnancy or if maintaining a safe pregnancy is compromising the treatment of the breast cancer?' Mrs Rivas decided to keep the pregnancy, but go through a grueling treatment schedule that included a mastectomy at six weeks and then receive chemotherapy in her second and third trimesters. Dr. Joanne Stone, a professor of obstetrics, gynecology and reproductive science at Mt. Sinai hospital in New York, treated Rivas and said she hoped Rivas' story would give other women comfort if they're diagnosed with cancer during pregnancy. 'What I think is really important about this story is that people know you can get diagnosed and you can get treated when you're pregnant,' said Dr. Stone. Emotionally and physically, the pregnancy coupled with the cancer made for a grueling journey. Her body changed as she put on weight as the baby grew and not only due to pregnancy but the treatment as well. While her appetite was steady, the chemotherapy led to hair loss. 'After the chemo was done, I was pretty much a normal pregnant person without hair,' said Rivas. 'I looked pretty silly and no boobs--it was just crazy.' Happy to be alive: Today Rivas is cancer free and raising her 6-month-old son Constantine with her husband . Adele credits help from her husband Luis for keeping her sane. Their little baby boy is now six months old and healthy . The couple moved into her mothers house so save some money during the time as well. After four rounds of chemotherapy, two months later she gave birth to a baby boy. Despite her worried that he might be born early or underweight, her fears proved to be unfounded and he born weighing more than 8 pounds. Six months on, the couple are still living with Mrs Rivas' mother but life is starting to a new normal. Looking back, Mrs Rivas says she never would have imagined she would have been able to get this far. 'I can't believe how fast things can change and how much you can endure,' Mrs Rivas said. 'I think of myself as a pretty tough person. If anyone told me that I was able to go through this, I would say they're nuts.'","Adele Rivas was told she had stage two breast cancer and was having a baby .
Approximately one out of every 3,000 pregnant women is diagnosed with breast cancer .
Her baby is a healthy boy and Mrs Rivas wants women to know that they can still have treatment to save their life while creating a new one ."
"A planet-wide conflict that claimed as many lives as the first two world wars combined would hardly make any difference to the world's exploding population, according to a study. The researchers claim that population growth is so out of control that even stringent restrictions on childbirth, disastrous pandemics, or World War Three would not make it manageable by the turn of the next century. They say the global population will likely exceed 10 billion by 2100, and even in the worst case scenario the minimum it could reach would be 5.1 billion. Another World War would not significantly dent the global population (stock image shown). That's according to a study by the University of Adelaide, Australia. Researchers say that the population has spiralled upwards. It is now more than likely to exceed 10 billion by 2100 . Professor Barry Brook, who co-led the study at the University of Adelaide, Australia, said: 'We were surprised that a five-year World War Three scenario, mimicking the same proportion of people killed in the first and second world wars combined, barely registered a blip on the human population trajectory this century.' Rather than reducing the number of people on the planet, cutting the consumption of natural resources and enhanced recycling would have a better chance of achieving effective sustainability gains in the next 85 years, they said. There are about seven billion people living on our planet and this number is set to reach almost 10 billion by 2050, according to UN figures. This population explosion is largely attributed to better healthcare and farming practices, with some experts arguing that industrialisation in the 18th and 19th centuries was the tipping point that allowed more humans to thrive. However, one social scientist claims the human population explosion has its roots as far back as 2,000 years ago. Aaron Stutz, an associate professor of anthropology at Emory’s Oxford College in Georgia created a new model of demographic and archaeological data to show when humans thrived. In a paper published in the journal PLOS ONE, he claims that political and economic reforms helped to create more stable families, and therefore enabled more people to thrive. World War Two claimed between 50 million and 85 million military and civilian lives, according to different estimates, making it the most lethal conflict by absolute numbers of dead in human history. Meanwhile, more than 37 million people are thought to have died in World War One. The scientists used a computer model based on demographic data from the World Health Organisation and United States Census Bureau to investigate different population reduction scenarios. They found that under current conditions of fertility, mortality and mother's average age at first childbirth, global population was likely to grow from seven billion in 2013 to 10.4 billion by 2100. Climate change, war, reduced mortality and fertility, and increased maternal age altered this prediction only slightly. A devastating global pandemic today that killed two billion people was only projected to reduce population size to 8.4 billion, while six billion deaths brought it down to 5.1 billion. The findings are published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy Of Sciences. Co-author Professor Corey Bradshaw, also from the University of Adelaide, said: 'Global population has risen so fast over the past century that roughly 14 per cent of all the human beings that have ever existed are still alive today. That's a sobering statistic. 'This is considered unsustainable for a range of reasons, not least being able to feed everyone as well as the impact on the climate and environment. World War Two claimed between 50 million and 85 million military and civilian lives, according to different estimates, but the researchers say this would not be more than a blip on the modern population. Pictured is the American Memorial Cemetery in Manila, Philippines . 'We examined various scenarios for global human population change to the year 2100 by adjusting fertility and mortality rates to determine the plausible range of population sizes at the end of this century. 'Even a worldwide one-child policy like China's, implemented over the coming century, or catastrophic mortality events like global conflict or a disease pandemic, would still likely result in five to 10 billion people by 2100.' Nine different scenarios were constructed, ranging from 'business as usual' population growth to highly unlikely disasters resulting in billions of deaths. Professor Brook, now at the University of Tasmania, said: 'As our models show clearly, while there needs to be more policy discussion on this issue, the current inexorable momentum of the global human population precludes any demographic 'quick fixes' to our sustainability problems. 'Our work reveals that effective family planning and reproduction education worldwide have great potential to constrain the size of the human population and alleviate pressure on resource availability over the longer term. 'Our great-great-great-great grandchildren might ultimately benefit from such planning, but people alive today will not.' Professor Bradshaw added: 'The corollary of these findings is that society's efforts towards sustainability would be directed more productively towards reducing our impact as much as possible through technological and social innovation.'","Another world war would not significantly dent the global population .

The exercise at Strensall Barracks, York, saw a hangar converted into a mock-up field hospital. On Friday medics, marines and sailors waved farewell as a Royal Navy ship left for Sierra Leone loaded with aid, food, water and equipment to help treat people infected with the deadly Ebola virus in a bid to stop it spreading. Prime Minister David Cameron has called for other countries to do more to tackle the epidemic, which has so far killed more than 4,500 people and has been deemed the 'most severe acute health emergency in modern times' by the World Health Organisation. The Royal Fleet Auxiliary (RFA) Argus, a navy ship, left Falmouth Docks in south west England for the 10-day journey to Sierra Leone - one of the west African countries worst hit by the disease.

"Forget soap and water - these days, women are ditching flannels in favour of electric face brushes to help give skin a super-deep clean. First on the scene, in 2009, was the £150 Clarisonic, but since then the market has exploded. Now, every major skincare brand, from Boots' No7 to Mary Kay, has their own. Last month, budget store Lidl announced a £9.99 version - including a year's worth of replacement heads (most manufacturers suggest replacing heads every three months, or when bristles become worn). While features vary, broadly speaking, there are two technologies: vibrating and rotating. There's no independent research to suggest one technology is superior, and most experts agree that, in general, all face brushes can be good for skin. Scroll down for video . Beauty ritual: Most experts agree that, in general, all face brushes can be good for skin . 'Face brushes make a ritual of cleansing, which can mean women are more likely to cleanse thoroughly,' says Dr Sam Bunting, a Harley Street cosmetic dermatologist. 'Used correctly, they can help remove more surface dirt than manual cleansing, meaning the products you use penetrate better.' Devotees claim they leave skin more toned and radiant, but Dr Bunting warns they need to be used with care: 'There is the potential for over-cleansing, damaging the skin, and they can even cause breakouts. It's about using it when your skin needs it, with an appropriate cleanser, such as Cetaphil, that won't over-dry your skin.' So, with Dr Bunting’s help, we compared some of the newest electric face brushes on the market, costing from under £10 to £155... Clarisonic Aria . Sophisticated technology:  The Clarisonic Aria . £155, clarisonic.co.uk . HEADS INCLUDED: One. Replacements cost from £35 for two. A range of types, including deep-pore cleansing, are available. HOW IT WORKS: The market leader (with price to match), it oscillates 300 times a second. The timer has a one-minute cycle, which beeps at 20, 40 and 50 seconds to remind you to change area, and a two-minute cycle. Fully charged (via the magnetic USB charger), it lasts around 28 minutes. WATERPROOF? Yes. VERDICT: Clarisonic brushes have the most sophisticated technology and their claims are supported by most research. This latest brush feels like a premium product: weighty and substantial. That said, I think you're paying for a brand name. I'm not convinced it cleans three times better than its £50 lookalike. 'I like the timer function,’ says Dr Bunting. ‘It’s very precise and anything that mitigates a tendency for overuse is a good thing, though I’m not convinced anyone needs to be using anything other than the gentlest head.’ Foxnovo 5 in 1 Electric Face and Body Cleaner . From £6.08, amazon.co.uk . HEADS INCLUDED: One brush, one sponge, one latex, one pumice, one massager. HOW IT WORKS: A battery-powered brush head rotating in one direction. No timer. WATERPROOF? No. VERDICT: This felt cheap. The bristles were scratchy, the head wobbled and the other heads felt either ineffective, or downright dangerous. 'Lots of women are inclined to equate that squeaky-clean feeling with taking care of their skin when, actually, it can indicate that you've damaged the skin's barrier function,' says Dr Bunting. 'The heads with this gadget mean there’s potential for abuse: some look more suited to woodwork than skincare.' Clinique Sonic System Purifying Cleansing Brush . £79, clinique.co.uk . HEADS INCLUDED: One. Replacements cost £20. HOW IT WORKS: This two-tone brush vibrates rather than rotates. Clinique advises using the soft, white bristles on the cheeks for 15 seconds, and the firm, green bristles on the T-zone for 15 seconds. A built-in timer stops movement after 30 seconds. It charges via a stand with a USB cable, and a full charge lasts 180 minutes. WATERPROOF? Yes. VERDICT: For the price, this didn't deliver. The design was unimpressive and the stand isn't waterproof, so you can’t keep it in the bathroom. Basically, it vibrates - the whole unit, not just the head. 'I'm not convinced that different bristles are necessary,' says Dr Bunting. 'You're not getting into the pores, just removing the top layer of make-up and dead skin cells. This didn't seem to have much cleaning power. I don’t think you’ll do any harm with it, but it’s not the best out there.' Cheaper choice: Olay claim their product works as well as the Clarisonic . Olay Regenerist Cleansing Kit . £20, amazon.co.uk . HEADS INCLUDED: One. Replacements cost £9.99 for two. HOW IT WORKS: Battery-powered brush head rotates up to 350 times a minute. Two speeds. No timer, but Olay advises moving it around the face for one minute. WATERPROOF? Yes. VERDICT: When Olay launched this brush in the U.S., it claimed its study showed it cleaned as effectively as the Clarisonic. Clarisonic later disputed the manner in which the tests had been conducted. However, Olay is the only budget brand publishing any research. This felt gentle enough. If you want to use it with your regular cleanser (it's sold with Olay's own), search Olaz (the name for Olay in Germany) on Amazon and buy the brush alone for around £17. 'A waterproof model at this end of the budget is a definite plus point,' says Dr Bunting. 'I'd like a timer, but it’s a good option.' Sanitas Cleansing Brush . £9.99, Lidl . HEADS INCLUDED: Three. Replacements cost £7.50 for two, including shipping from Germany. HOW IT WORKS: Battery-powered brush with two modes: spinning and oscillating. No timer. WATERPROOF? No. VERDICT: This won't win any prizes for looks, and the bristles splayed so easily, I can't imagine they'd last the four months they claim. Not the best budget option. 'The distinction between the two modes - rotating, for a gentle cleanse, and oscillating, for a thorough cleanse - is pointless,' says Dr Bunting. 'With no timer, people could be more inclined to use it for too long.' Budget buy: Lidl's version is just £9.99 and the bristles splayed easily . Magnitone Lucid Facial Brush . £49.99, lookfantastic.com . HEADS INCLUDED: One. Replacement heads cost £15.99 for two. A sensitive version and one for the body are available. HOW IT WORKS: Uses a pulsing - or vibrating - technology, charges via a magnetic system and, fully charged, lasts around 28 minutes. Magnitone recommends using for 20 seconds each on the forehead, nose and chin, and ten seconds on each cheek. It beeps every 20 seconds and stops after one minute. WATERPROOF? Yes. VERDICT: Although the design and magnetic charger look like the Clarisonic, this is smaller and lighter, and moves only 10,000 times a minute, compared with the Clarisonic's 18,000. Without evidence that twice the movements makes for twice as good cleansing, I thought it a decent alternative. However, Dr Bunting wasn’t impressed: ‘I’m really concerned about their claim that this can stimulate collagen production. 'I don't think you should be using cleansing to do that, and telling people they should be using it twice a day to get this result could tempt women with wrinkles and delicate skin to overuse it, upsetting the barrier function of the skin, and causing more damage.' M&S Radiant Cleanse Facial Cleansing Brush . £19.50, marksandspencer.com . HEADS INCLUDED: One. Replacement heads cost £6. HOW IT WORKS: A battery-powered brush that spins in one direction. No timer, but the manufacturer advises moving across the face in gentle movements for between 30 seconds and a minute. WATERPROOF? No. VERDICT: The brush was soft but, as with all rotating brushes, I felt it dragged the skin round the eyes more than the vibrating brushes. 'This is a good budget option,' says Dr Bunting, 'but not being able to use it in the shower marks it down. Although they advise a time limit, without a built-in timer, it would be too easy to overuse.' Expensive option: Philips VisaPure is £150 . Philips VisaPure . £150, philips.co.uk . HEADS INCLUDED: Two (one normal, one sensitive). A range of replacements, including an exfoliating one, start at £8 for one. HOW IT WORKS: A brush with two speeds that rotates in one direction while vibrating. Philips suggests cleansing the T-zone and both cheeks for 20 seconds each. It pauses every 20 seconds and turns off after a minute. The charger plugs into a storage cradle: a full charge lasts 30 minutes. WATERPROOF? Yes. VERDICT: This is comfortable, but looks odd and is easy to turn off accidentally. It's the most expensive rotating brush here and the only rechargeable (rather than battery-powered) one. I like it, but I think you pay for the design and stand. 'Their research shows it cleanses ten times better than manual cleansing,' says Dr Bunting. 'The timer will prevent overuse. As with any brush, I'd recommend gradually introducing it to your regime, and less use in winter.'","Women are ditching flannels in favour of electric face brushes .

"Britons should avoid drinking alcohol on consecutive days, the Government’s health quango is to advise. In a startling shift in official guidance, the public are to be told that they should abstain for a day after drinking. Public Health England says the ‘one day on, one day off’ rule is needed because daily drinking is a key contributor to increased health risks. Scroll down for video . Drinking every day is a key contributor to increased health risks, according to Public Health England . However the proposed guidance has been branded ‘nannying’ by critics, while experts questioned whether there was any evidence it would decrease health risks. Tory MP Gerald Howarth last night called it ‘completely unrealistic’, adding: ‘People have the common sense to know how to look after themselves.’ The plan is contained in an official document from the quango and is mentioned among ‘new strategies to help people remain within the guidelines’. It states that a ‘simple approach’ such as never drinking two days in a row would have a positive impact on health. Regular drinking ‘over the lower-risk guideline’ – meaning anything more than one large glass of wine for a woman or one to two pints of lager for a man – can ‘become a problem’, it adds. As a result, health chiefs propose to ‘explore the effectiveness and impact of encouraging people to have some drink-free time every week’. Yesterday critics said the new guidelines would simply worry those who drink moderate amounts – and would do little to tackle those who binge-drink or have an alcohol problem. Tory MP Gerald Howarth (pictured) has called the proposed guidance 'completely unrealistic' GP Dr Martin Scurr said: ‘Giving up alcohol on alternate days is not something most doctors would recognise as a helpful strategy to curb excessive drinking.’ Drinking regularly in moderation was ‘better and safer for health than abstinence’, he said, claiming the ‘middle-aged, middle-class drinker’ should not be ‘made to feel guilty over having a restorative glass of wine every day’. Others criticised the Government for issuing yet another set of ‘nannying’ guidelines about alcohol. Chris Snowden of the Institute of Economic Affairs think-tank said: ‘People don’t pay attention to guidelines – and it’s hardly surprising when they change so much. The Government would be much better off simply to say “everything in moderation”.’ He added: ‘Public Health England should be closed down. We are supposed to be living in times of austerity and the Government is spending tens of millions of pounds on a nanny-state quango.’ Tory MP Andrew Rosindell added: ‘We live in a free society and it’s up to people to decide if to drink, when and how often, provided they behave in a lawful way. Public Health England should stick to matters of serious concern in terms of public health, not start straying into telling people how to live their lives.’ The suggested new guidelines are contained in a marketing strategy drawn up by PHE. It suggests initially starting the campaign for ‘drink free days’ on a regional basis. If successful, much stronger guidance could then be made official across the country. Defending the idea, officials said early research indicates it could prove easier for people to stick to than advice which says they should simply reduce the amount they drink every time they go out. Present guidance from the Chief Medical Officer is for people to ideally refrain from drinking on two or three days a week. Women are told not to drink more than three units a day, while men are allowed four. A large glass of wine is typically three units, while a pint of lager is just over two. Last night Public Health England said further action was required because of the rising toll of health problems linked to drinking – estimated to cost the country £21billion. Officials said early research indicates it could prove easier for people to stick to than advice which says they should simply reduce the amount they drink every time they go out . Some 15,479 people died from alcohol-related causes in 2010 – up 30 per cent since 2001. A quarter of all deaths among men aged 16 to 24 are also attributable to alcohol. A PHE spokesman said it was still ‘exploring the evidence’, but stood by the guidelines. ‘This helps to break the habit of drinking regularly and early findings from consumer research indicates that people may find it easier to reduce drinking occasions as opposed to drinking the volume consumed on each occasion.’ Emily Robinson, of Alcohol Concern, said: ‘Sometimes it’s hard to make sure you have two or more days off from drinking but it is important to have a regular break.’ Giving up alcohol on alternate days is not something most doctors would recognise as a helpful strategy to curb excessive drinking. Firstly, I don’t know of any prospective studies trying out this approach. This is where researchers recruit volunteers to try to discover from the outset what effect it has on an individual’s health and on their attitudes towards alcohol. And I doubt very much whether there are any epidemiological studies that have investigated it, which would mean looking at statistics on groups of people to discover if alternate-day drinking results in different outcomes for different groups. In other words, where is the evidence? What we do know is that drinking regularly in moderation, probably a drink a day, about one or two units, is better and safer for health than abstinence mainly due to its benefits for heart health. This particularly applies to men over 40 and post-menopausal women, who are at higher risk of heart disease – although it’s clear from the evidence that drinking a lot more is positively dangerous. But the binge-drinking that plagues our society is seldom the province of those worried about how their hearts are holding up, let alone their livers and all the other organs susceptible to the damage caused by large amounts of ethanol. It’s hard to see how this plan from Public Health England – which is presumably concerned about public health in its widest sense – will persuade excessive drinkers to rein back. A thoughtful strategy aimed at tackling the anti-social mayhem caused on our high streets each weekend by mainly young binge drinkers – who have pre-loaded before they even venture out – would be a eureka moment. Instead it seems the target is the middle-aged, middle-class drinker, who will be made to feel guilty over having a restorative glass of wine every day. Wouldn’t it be more user-friendly to encourage the techniques that people actually employ to keep their consumption down, by showing restraint that works for them? For example, the two days off each week that I know many patients have adopted to cut their drinking by two-sevenths – providing they don’t drink more on the other days to make up. Or having a dry January that shows the bottle who’s boss. Drinking in moderation is for many people part of a balanced lifestyle that can at the very least, according to Plato, help us live with the ‘crabbedness of old age’. It’s questionable whether this notion of alternate day drinking will do much beyond making the vast majority of these drinkers just a little more grumpy on a Saturday morning.

"Two nurses who contracted Ebola while caring for Thomas Eric Duncan - the first person to be diagnosed with, and die of the virus in the United States - have been hailed as heroes by their colleagues. Nurses Nina Pham, 26, and Amber Vinson, 29, were diagnosed last week after caring for Mr Duncan before he went into isolation at Dallas Presbyterian Hospital and was extremely contagious. While they are being treated in two different hospitals across the country, their fellow staff members spoke of their support for the pair as they defended the hospital following weeks of negative media coverage. Chief nursing officer at Cole Edmonson said the nurses were 'devastated' by Mr Duncan's death, but nevertheless 'proud' of their work.

Defiant: The nurses showed their support for their hospital after weeks of being criticized. However they would not elaborate on investigations into the treatment of Mr Duncan . During the news conference, nurse Julie Irving insisted the group had 'worked tirelessly' to save the Liberian, who died on October 8. 'This could have happened to any hospital,' she said. 'Some things went wrong and we are proud to say that Presbyterian has owned those things, and will make us stronger and more diligent when it comes to saving lives in the future.' Nurse Chantea Irving added: 'A lot has been said about our hospital in recent weeks. Some of it accurate, some of it wildly inaccurate. That has been very frustrating, disappointing and hard on our nurses.' However the trio did not elaborate on ongoing investigations as to why the patient was sent home with just antibiotics after his initial visit to the hospital. 'Heroes': Nurses Nina Pham, 26, (left) and Amber Vinson, 29, (right) were diagnosed last week after caring for Mr Duncan before he went into isolation and was extremely contagious . Criticism: Nurse Chantea Irving (left) told reporters: 'A lot has been said about our hospital in recent weeks. Some of it accurate, some of it wildly inaccurate . Duncan arrived at Texas Health Presbyterian on September 26, but was sent home only with antibiotics despite telling a nurse he had recently been to West Africa. He returned two days later in an ambulance when his symptoms worsened and was diagnosed and isolated. Pham tested positive for Ebola in Dallas on October 12, making her the first person to contract the deadly virus in the United States. Vinson tested positive for Ebola on October 15. Pham is being treated National Institutes of Health hospital in Bethesda, Maryland while Vinson is in the Emory University Hospital in Atlanta, Georgia .

"As budget airlines get more and more stingy, charging for everything from printing boarding passes to on-board snacks, plenty of 'whatever next?' quips have been made. Previously joked about but scarcely believed travel horrors such as standing-only flights and extra fees for obese passengers may soon become a reality though, according to reports. While flying first class is only getting more luxurious with on-board showers, nannies for children and private suites, the whole plane experience is gradually becoming a lot worse for those who can't afford to fly luxe class. Scroll down for video . The future is not bright: Airlines will be going to even more extreme lengths to cut costs . Airlines will be going to even more extreme lengths to cut costs and cram in more passengers on every flight, according to a report compiled by Breadwise. Standing cabins . Among some of the more bizarre and worrying innovations in travellers' future are the vertical passenger seats. The idea of the 'standing cabin' made headlines in 2010 when Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary suggested that the airline would be introducing it, but spokespeople for the airline have since rejected the idea, . Nevertheless, the 'Skyrider' seat has been created by AvioInteriors, and aerospace engineering professor at the Universiti Putra Malaysia Fairuz Romli predicts that the 'standing cabin' will be in planes within five years. That looks uncomfortable: The vertical passenger seat has been discussed for some time, but one expert predicts they will be a reality within five years . 'I'm a frequent flier and most of the times during domestic flights, it feels like the flying time is very short that the aircraft is already descending for landing before you can unfasten your seatbelt after takeoff,' he told CNN. 'Hence the big question came to my mind: in such a short duration of flight time, do we really need to sit down?' Romli's research predicts that standing cabins could increase passenger capacity by 21 per cent, and cut the cost of a ticket by up to 44 per cent. The 'fat tax' With soaring fuel costs, every kilogram counts. While some airlines insist on overweight passengers purchasing an extra seat, a new pricing structure could see those over a certain weight threshold facing a surcharge. A Norwegian economics scholar, Dr. Bharat P. Bhatta, published a paper outlining three possible ways of charging passengers for excess weight, including a per-kilo fee and charge for total weight of the passenger and their luggage combined. Pay per kilo: While some airlines currently charge overweight passengers for two seats, potential new pricing structures could see travellers facing per-kilo surcharges . No life jackets - hang on to your seat cushion instead! By the same token, Air Canada's regional airline Jazz removed all life jackets from its aircraft in 2008, saving 25 kilograms per flight. The airline was allowed to do this as regulations state that flotation devices rather than safety jackets may be used if the plane stays within 50 miles of shore. Passengers are now instructed to hold on to their seat cushions in case of an emergency. Will other domestic airlines offload their life jackets too? All-female flight crew . In yet another bizarre fuel and therefore money-saving measure, at least one airline has proposed hiring only female crew, who are on average 15-20 kilograms lighter than male flight attendants. Indian budget airline GoAir last year announced plans to hire 2,000 new crew members over the next seven years as its expands - all female. Current male employees will be unaffected. Female only: At least one airline is going to extreme lengths to cut costs, hiring only female crew members, who are on average 15-20 kilograms lighter than males . And they're not stopping there. 'We are reducing the weight on board our aircraft. The size of in-flight magazines has been reduced. The potable water tanks are no longer being filled to capacity as only 35% to 40% of that water is actually used. Now the water tanks are filled 60%, GoAir CEO Giorgio De Roni told The Times of India. With huge savings predicted, it may not be long before other airlines follow suit. Pay to pee . Like many public restrooms, coughing up to use the WC on board may soon be a reality. Serial offender of the stingiest airlines, Ryanair, is just one to announce plans to introduce coin-operated toilets. The idea is to encourage passengers to use the bathroom before their flight,so that airlines can remove at least toilets from each plane and replace them with extra seats. Removing the loos: Some airlines will introduce coin-operated WCs, hoping to discourage passengers from using them - so toilets can be removed to make room for more seats . DIY everything . First passengers were checking themselves in, now some airlines require them to print their baggage tags as well. Before long, travellers will be scanning fingerprints to board the plane and grabbing food and drink on board themselves, according to forecasters. Last year, British Airways began trials of a reusable digital bag tag  that syncs with the BA smartphone app. Each time the passenger flies, the electronic barcode on the bag tag updates to a new unique code. In 2008, Air New Zealand introduced total self check-in on domestic flights, which saw passengers check in, tag and deposit their luggage on a conveyor belt to be processed behind the scenes.  'It’s very unusual for us to see any queues forming anywhere at the airport,' Air New Zealand CEO Rob Fyfe said at the time. 'For the passenger, it means less hassle, a shorter journey and an improved experience, and for us it means a competitive advantage.' Chat at 30,000 feet: The FCC may be reversing its ban on in-flight cellular communications . In-flight phone calls . Most passengers have welcomed airlines softening stance on the use of electronic devices during takeoff and landing. And the introduction of wifi on board. But do they really want to listen to their seat neighbour chatting away at 30,000 feet on a long-haul flight, with nowhere to run? In January the Federal Communication Commission proposed a reversal of its 1991 ruling that cellular communications on aircraft be banned. The use of phones in-flight is no longer unsafe because of changes in mobile technology, according to InformationWeek.","Standing cabins, coin-operated loos and all-female crew could be reality .

"Her personal life may have suffered a blow after discovering boyfriend Lewis Bloor had been cheating on her, but Lauren Pope's professional life is booming. The TOWIE star, who maintains that her career will always come first, has seen her clothing line and hair extension brand go from strength to strength in recent months. So popular has her Hair Rehab London business become that even style queen Cheryl Fernandez-Versini has been wearing her extensions on X Factor in recent weeks. Scroll down for video . Success story: Lauren Pope, who found fame on The Only Way Is Essex, established her hair extension brand, Hair Rehab London, in 2007 and now she has countless celebrity fans . Speaking to MailOnline about her latest fan, Lauren said: 'It's pretty amazing to think that anyone is wearing a product I've designed and created and it's always exciting to see those results. So when the products are on a big name like Cheryl it does give you a great buzz.' Established in 2007 - three years before Lauren joined hit TV show The Only Way is Essex - Hair Rehab London began as a MySpace business and today employs a host of staff and sees sales increase by an average of 270 per cent annually. To start up the company and secure investment for her ideas, Lauren entered Tycoon - a business TV show, which gave start up companies six weeks to set up. Each week, Lauren explains how she would pitch for further investment and advice, learning invaluable business lessons as she went along. She's got the X Factor: Cheryl, left, wore the extensions on the Jonathan Ross show last week.

Speaking about her success, Lauren said: 'I decided to set up my own company as, at the time, I found I was having to make my own hand sewn extensions due to a lack of affordable styles on the market. I looked in to the business and manufacturing behind it, secured investment and started by selling through MySpace. It all took off from there. 'A lot of people don’t realise that I had a successful business before I joined TOWIE and that I balance being an entrepreneur alongside taking part in the show. 'Hair Rehab London has always been important to me and I work hard to ensure the company keeps on growing and my team is happy. It’s been great to see the business go from strength to strength - it’s a testament to the quality of the product that people keep coming back to us.' Her products are available with 100 per cent real hair and synthetic styles in clip-in extensions, plaits, buns, ponytails and headbands, with prices ranging from £9.99 to £139.99. Since founding the brand, Lauren can count the Little Mix girls, Sam Faiers, Denise Van Outen, and Sarah Harding as her fans - and she said it would be 'super exciting' to see Nicole Richie wearing them. As well as working on Hair Rehab London, Lauren is a professional DJ and recently unveiled her third clothing collection for In The Style.

'Fashion has now become such a big part of my life, especially since starting my Style Diary last year,' she explained. 'One of my favourite things to do is try out new styles and ideas and share these ideas via social media. I tend to always keep it pretty demure these days but always try and add a sexy twist in there somewhere, either by showing a bit of leg or tummy.' Lauren, 32, is constantly complemented on her youthful looks and, unlike a lot of her Essex pals, who swear by lashings of fake tan and false eyelashes, Lauren prefers to keep it pared-back when it comes to her beauty regime. 'I try to keep it as simple as possible by using a gentle facial cleanser by Biore and then use a moisturiser and eye cream,' she told us. 'I love Estee Lauder for eye creams or serums, they're a little bit more expensive but you see the results. I love these products especially now I've stopped having Botox - I can see signs of ageing around the eyes slightly more now I'm in my thirties.'

"An Oxford student threw up during an English Language lecture about the origin of the words 'lash' and 'Jagermeister'. The unfortunately-timed incident sparked an amused reaction yesterday at the 928-year-old university after disrupting the end of an etymology talk. Professor Charlotte Brewer, an expert on the Oxford English Dictionary, was discussing colloquialisms including 'lord of lash', 'prince of pulls', 'banter' and 'Jägermeister'. It seemed it was all too much for a female first-year undergraduate, who vomited on the floor. Been on the lash? The incident happened as Prof Charlotte Brewer discussed the origins of drinking 'banter' Aftermath: The scene after the unfortunately-timed incident, which prompted predictable student mirth . The unidentifed student has since been nicknamed 'chundergraduate' by Oxford student tabloid The Tab. One English undergraduate told the newspaper: 'It was hilarious because the whole room one-by-one became aware of it like a domino effect. 'She looked horrified and was frantically asking for tissues. I'm not sure if she was hungover or not, but she certainly looked green around the gills.' The lecturer who was giving the talk, Professor Charlotte Brewer, is an expert on the history of the Oxford English Dictionary and how each edition reflects the time in which it was written. Her lecture yesterday afternoon had turned to the origin of words found in the spoof Agony Lad column of The Oxford Student, an undergraduate-led magazine. Expert: Prof Brewer, who gave the lecture, studies changes to the dictionary printed in the ancient city (above) The anonymous author describes himself as the 'lord of lash, baron of banter and prince of pulling', adding: 'There are plenty of ladies out there who know me very… intimately. 'If you want to be one of those lucky customers, head to where the drinking is fiercest, follow the smell of Jägermeister, and I’ll be there.' Sadly for the student journalists, they were unable to establish conclusively whether their fellow undergraduate was hungover or simply ill. One student added: 'The Agony Lad column isn't sufficiently vile as to cause vomiting. 'She probably just went a bit hard the night before.'","Etymology expert Prof Charlotte Brewer was discussing college 'banter'

"Claire Orton allegedly commented that an 'extremely poorly' baby was 'better off dead' A nurse with a throat infection breathed onto a sick baby's face and said it would be 'better off dead', a tribunal has been told. Claire Orton allegedly giggled after exhaling onto the 'extremely poorly' child while it was being treated at University Hospital, Coventry. Orton was being investigated by Coventry and Warwickshire NHS Trust over a separate incident when the allegations over 'Baby B' came to light. The Nursing and Midwifery Council hearing heard how Orton was already under investigation for allegedly leaving a student nurse to look after a poorly baby, despite being unqualified to do so. In that first alleged incident, Orton is accused of not responding promptly to Jade Matthews's calls for help. The child was suffering from brachycardia, a low resting heart rate. Carolina Cabral, representing the NMC, said the two allegations relate to separate night shifts involving different babies, both on the neonatal ward. She said: 'Unfortunately when Baby B was born it was extremely poorly, and was located on the neonatal ward. 'You will hear from one colleague of Ms Orton's that he heard her say to him that Baby B was ""better off dead"". 'At the time the registrant was not very well, recovering from a throat infection. 'You will hear from this witness that he saw Ms Orton exhale onto Baby B's face and that she thought it was humorous. She then started giggling afterwards.' The allegations over the first incident came after a shift on July 1, 2012, in which Orton was working with several colleagues, including Ms Matthews. Ms Carbral told the hearing: 'During the course of the shift there was an emergency situation where Baby A became brachycardic, due to a decrease in oxygen saturation levels. 'Jade Matthews will say that she began calling out the decreasing levels of oxygen to the registrant, as she was not qualified to deal with the situation herself. 'Ms Matthews will say that she was sure Ms Orton could hear her, but that she did not come over to assist until the baby's oxygen saturation levels reached 20 percent. The nurse was working in the neonatal unit at University Hospital, Coventry, when the alleged incidents took place . 'The charge is in main that the registrant failed to respond promptly to the emergency situation.' Orton accepts that a doctor was not called and that she failed to record any notes about the incident. She later admitted she should not have allowed the student nurse to look after the baby, but thought it was a good learning experience. Orton denies inappropriately breathing on Baby B's face and saying it would be 'better off dead.' She also denies failing to provide prompt assistance to Ms Matthews in relation to Baby A. If her fitness to practise is found to be impaired she could be struck off. The hearing continues.

"Danny Alexander wants to target pension pots . The Liberal Democrats will today promise to increase NHS spending by targeting the pension pots of the middle classes. Danny Alexander, the Lib Dem Chief Secretary to the Treasury, said the party would spend £1billion a year more on the Health Service than David Cameron pledged earlier this week. The spending increase will be paid for by measures including limiting tax relief on pension pots for what the Lib Dems called ‘high earners’. But experts said last night that the raid would hit thousands hoping to retire on annual pensions of £30,000. The pledge – which could affect many public sector workers – will be announced at the Lib Dem conference, which gets under way in Glasgow today. It comes as a survey of party members found that two thirds believe fewer than 40 Lib Dem MPs would be elected at next May’s general election – down from 57 at the last election. Earlier this week, David Cameron said the Conservatives would ring-fence the Health Service budget. But Mr Alexander will announce that the Lib Dem manifesto will promise to spend £1billion a year more than this. This would be funded from measures to reduce the lifetime allowance for tax relief on pension savings from £1.25million to £1million. In addition, the Lib Dems want to adjust dividend tax for additional rate taxpayers, and end the Tory policy of ‘shares for rights’ under which workers sacrifice basic employment rights in exchange for shares in the company for which they work. Mr Alexander said: ‘A comprehensive Health Service paid for by the taxpayer and delivered free at the point of need was a Liberal idea and is a central part of our vision of a stronger economy and a fairer society. ‘We will raise this extra money from asking the better off to contribute a little more in tax. This Liberal Democrat commitment is fully and fairly funded.’ Mr Alexander said the Lib Dems would spend £1billion a year more on the Health Service than David Cameron pledged earlier this week . But former Treasury pensions adviser Dr Ros Altmann said the raid on pension pots would affect those expecting annual post-retirement incomes of around £30,000. ‘These are not wealthy people – £30,000 a year is hardly a king’s ransom,’ she said. ‘This would make many people very upset. ‘A lot of people, particularly in the public sector, on good final salary schemes could be caught in the tax net. You should be free to make your money grow as much as possible.’ Yesterday a YouGov poll put the Lib Dems on only 6 per cent of the vote, equalling its lowest level since the polling organisation was formed in 2000. The poll for The Sun and The Times – carried out after the Prime Minister’s promises of tax cuts at the Tory conference – gave his party a lead of one percentage point over Labour. The Conservatives were on 35 per cent, Labour on 34 per cent and Ukip on 14 per cent. Meanwhile, a poll of 735 Lib Dem party members for Liberal Democrat Voice, an activists’ website, found that 80 per cent continue to support the Coalition. But 67 per cent said they expected the party to slip below 40 MPs at the next election. While 50 per cent said they were satisfied with Mr Clegg’s leadership, this is only just ahead of the 48 per cent who said they were ‘dissatisfied’.","Danny Alexander, the Lib Dem Chief Secretary to the Treasury, made pledge .

"Bermuda suffered extensive powercuts after it was battered by Hurricane Gonzalo but it escaped the catastrophic damage and death toll that many had feared. Much of the Atlantic archipelago was without electricity this morning and many roads were impassable due to downed trees and debris. Only minor injuries were reported, however, Bermuda officials said. Scroll down for video . The clean-up begins in Hamilton, Bermuda after it was hit by Hurricane Gonzalo although the whole scale destruction and large death tolls predicted never materialised . The strongest storm to sweep the subtropical British territory in ten years hit Bermuda with maximum sustained winds of around 110mph as it reached landfall Friday night, forecasters said, with hurricane-force winds extending up to 60 miles from its centre. Premier Michael Dunkley said in a statement that islanders awoke to damaged property, blocked roads and no electricity, 'all things that can be replaced and restored'. 'I think all of Bermuda would agree that we took a licking. We are a bit bruised,' Mr Dunkley said in a radio broadcast, according to the local Royal Gazette. But, he added, 'all in all we came out of this storm much better than we expected.' By mid-today weather on the island had improved with Gonzalo about 355 miles north-northeast of Bermuda . By mid-Saturday, weather on the island had improved with Gonzalo about 355 miles north-northeast of Bermuda, with sustained winds of 90 mph, the U.S. National Hurricane Centre in Miami said. Bermuda Electric Light Company had restored power to thousands of customers, though about 25,000 out of 36,000 metered connections remained without electricity, the company said. Workmen use a digger to help clear the roads of fallen trees after the island was hit by Gonzalo . Not sailing away: Though tress are down all over the island the damage is not catastrophic . Many of the island's roads are still impassable after Hurricane Gonzalo struck . Yachts that have broken way from their moorings sit on a rock in Hamilton Harbour . The damage to some boats was extensive although these two should be salvageable .

Taking it in: A man is seen on the coast of Bermuda looking out at the surf as the hurricane makes its approach . From above: A satellite image of Gonzalo as it hit Bermuda late last night and early this morning . Gonzalo approached Bermuda as a Category 3 storm then weakened to Category 2 strength just before coming ashore with sustained winds of 110mph . The last major hurricane to hit Bermuda, which is located approximately 600 miles of the coast of North Carolina, was Fabian in 2003, which caused $100million in damage. The storm is currently continuing its path up the Atlantic and some forecasters believe its tail end will reach Britain this week.","Bermuda still without power after hurricane and many roads impassable .

"A terminally ill father-of-one has penned a number of heartbreaking letters to his three-year-old son which are to be opened on special occasions after being told he has less than six months to live. Simon Langston, from Evesham, Worcestershire, has also renewed his wedding vows with his wife  of six years Kelly, 26, after being diagnosed with brain cancer. He was told the devastating news in June, after a trip to his GP for dizziness and sickness resulted in him having a biopsy which revealed the tumour, and now hopes to hold on for one last Christmas with his family. The 32-year-old has written the series of letters to his son, Alfie, so that the youngster will have part of his father with him for special occasions such as birthdays, the day he passes his driving test and his own wedding day. Simon Langston, 32, from Evesham, Worcestershire, (pictured with his wife Kelly) has been given six months to live after being diagnosed with brain cancer in June following a visit to his GP with dizziness and sickness . Mr Langston has written 'special occasion' letters for his three-year-old son Alfie (pictured together above) so that he has part of his father with him on special days in his life such as his birthdays and his own wedding day . Mr Langston has renewed his wedding vows with wife Kelly, 26, (pictured together above with their son Alfie) and donned Halloween-inspired wedding attire for the special ceremony which was attended by 80 guests . Mr Langston also chose to renew his wedding vows with his wife on Halloween and invited 80 guests to the spooky-themed ceremony, which also raised money for charity. The bride wore her original wedding dress, customised with jewelled spiders, while the groom's face was painted as a skull and his wheelchair adorned with ribbons and autumn leaves. Their young son, Alfie, also wore a Halloween-inspired suit, which was decorated with spiders and inflatable bat wings. The couple recited a poem to each other in front of the guests, who also joined in with the theme and donned fancy dress. Mrs Langston said: 'We both had the most magical, amazing day, and were overwhelmed by the effort people made to dress up. 'It was a highly emotional ceremony, but it was lightened at points by the sound of Alfie inflating his wings, which had our guests in giggles. 'Simon did amazingly well and managed to stay for all of the day and most of the evening. 'We are just so happy at this moment in time, and cherishing every second.' The couple married six years ago (above) but decided to renew their vows after Mr Langston's diagnosis . The couple, from Worcestershire, renewed their vows with a Halloween-themed wedding ceremony last Friday . The couple, who have been married for six years, discovered Mr Langston had brain cancer in June after he started to feel unwell following a night out with friends. Mrs Langston said: 'Simon had been out with his friends for his birthday, but when he came home, he was dizzy and being sick. I knew he hadn't drunk very much, so I was worried. 'I drove him to the GP, and they gave him anti-dizziness tablets, but then I started to notice a slight droop on the right side of his face. 'I rushed him to an out of hours GP, and he was taken straight to Worcester Hospital. They did a scan, which revealed a tumour.' A few days later, he underwent a biopsy at a Coventry hospital, which revealed the tumour was cancerous. She said: 'It was in the middle of his brain, meaning it was too dangerous to remove it. I felt numb.' The biopsy left Mr Langston with limited speech, and he is now confined to a wheelchair. He underwent radiotherapy for two weeks, but his low blood count meant that it would be too dangerous for him to continue the treatment. Mr Langston, 32, discovered he had brain cancer in June after going to the GP with dizziness and sickness . The couple, who married for the first time six years ago (above), are now making the most of their time left . Mr Langston has frozen his sperm so that his wife can one day give Alfie a brother or sister through IVF . His wife added: 'It was really hard for Simon to not be able to express himself, or run around with his son. 'Simon used to be very active - he loved driving, and had a very physical job testing machinery at an AD plant, which turns food waste into electricity. 'The doctor told us that continuing radiotherapy would not make much difference, so we both decided that he would be more comfortable at home, where I could look after him, and where he would be able to spend as much time with Alfie as possible. 'It's been hard, but I used to be a care-assistant, so I have some experience.' The couple have also chosen to freeze Mr Langston's sperm, so that his wife can one day give Alfie a brother or sister through IVF. The couple are hoping to spend Christmas together . Mrs Langston said: 'When we had Alfie, our family really felt like it was complete. 'Simon's great with kids - he's been enjoying racing around in his wheelchair with Alfie, and he wants to see our family grow.' She said her husband has been penning letters to the young boy so that he has something from his father on special occasions. She added: 'Alfie's still a little too young to understand what is happening. 'We both want to make sure that he knows how much his daddy loves him, and how he'll always be watching over him.' The couple decided to renew their wedding vows on Halloween because of their love for the day. Mrs Langston, who is now a full-time carer to her husband, said: 'We've always loved Halloween - Simon is a big kid really. 'We wanted something memorable - something that people could enjoy and have fun with, as well as raising money for a good cause. 'We were going to write our own vows, but when we put pen to paper, it got too emotional. 'I knew it would have been too hard to read them to each other, so we each chose a poem close to our hearts instead.' During the day, Alfie handed out home-made toffee apples to the guests as wedding favours, with the help of bridesmaid Mia, 13. The couple's special day was supported by Tesco and they managed to raise £1,500 for Macmillan Cancer Support. Mrs Langston said: 'We raised over £720 through ticket sales alone, and that's not including tickets sold on the day. 'We've honestly been amazed by everyone's generosity. What started out as a small ceremony has been blown out of all proportion. All of the 80 guests were also asked to wear fancy dress for the occasion, which raised £1500 for charity . The couple discovered Mr Langston had brain cancer in June and he was given only six months left to live . The family decorated Mr Langston's wheelchair for the ceremony (left), while his wife Kelly wore her original wedding dress but added Halloween-inspired decorations to it for the renewal of the vows (right) 'We are now looking forward to our next charity event, which will be a bonfire and firework display. 'All being well, this will be held on Sunday, so Simon is now throwing himself into thinking up some ideas for this.' The family are now hoping to make the most of each day and are hastily making plans to ensure they their remaining time together is memorable. Mrs Langston added: 'The doctors have advised us that we should take each month Simon is alive as a blessing. 'We are sincerely hoping that he makes it to Christmas, but for now I'm grateful to have him at home, where I can look after him and make him feel comfortable. 'Simon really has been given the worst diagnosis, but there's no point being sad. I just feel so lucky that we get time to say goodbye.'","Simon Langston diagnosed with cancer in June after feeling sick and dizzy .

"An aid worker may have been forced to hang himself by his Syrian jailers, his inquest heard today.

Despite being in good spirits and looking forward to his imminent release, Dr Khan was found hanged in his central Damascus jail days before his planned release. William Hague, then Foreign Secretary, rejected the Syrian government’s explanation of suicide, saying the humanitarian was ‘effectively murdered’. Today, a jury of four women and seven men were sworn to examine the circumstances surrounding the death. Chief Coroner Peter Thorton QC told them: ‘Dr Abbas Khan died in custody in Syria on 16 December 2013, aged 32. ‘In this country, he was a qualified doctor and surgeon, working for the NHS. ‘Although his death was in Damascus in Syria, under our law an inquest must be held into his death.’ Dr Khan, who was on a humanitarian mission to war-torn Aleppo, had been held for some time in Adra prison (pictured) in the Syrian capital Damascus . The coroner said ‘no organisation or government is on trial’. ‘He was found dead, allegedly hanged, in prison in Damascus on December 16 last year.’ The coroner said Dr Khan’s trip had been ‘risky’. ‘It had dangers. The Foreign Office's clear and firm advice is do not travel to Syria. ‘There is no evidence that Dr Khan went to Syria to fight.’ The coroner said the main issues for the jury to consider after hearing all the evidence were likely to be - did Dr Khan take his own life, or was he 'forced in some way by his captors to take his own life against his will', or was he 'unlawfully killed' by his captors. The inquest heard from Dr Khan’s mother Fatima, who undertook a perilous solo mission to Damascus in a bid to free her son. She told the jury that in July last year she went to Syria to rescue her son and visited a number of embassies, ministries and prisons to try to find out where he was. Some of the buildings she went to were shaken by bomb blasts and vans she travelled in came under sniper fire. 'I felt scared, but my son was here so I had to be brave.' She would kiss the shoes of the officials she met and beg them to help her. Dr Khan had been held for nearly a year by the government of President Assad (pictured) at the time of his death in December last year . At the end of that month, she saw her son at the Court of Terrorism. 'I hugged him. He was a skeleton. He was in tears. I said, ""Look, mummy is here for you"". He said, ""Sorry, I shouldn't have come here, please take me home"". 'His hands were cold as if he was fasting. They were full of black marks and one nail was missing as if someone had taken it off. His feet were completely burnt. 'I said, ""What's all this?"". He said, ""This is nothing, I have suffered more than this"".' She said she threw herself at the judge's feet and begged for mercy but he said there were allegations against her son, who was taken away in chains and then transferred to a civilian prison. Mrs Khan said that when she visited him there at the end of August, he said the conditions were much better. He said the previous prison was 'like Hell' with seven prisoners sharing an eight feet square cell 24 hours a day. 'He said it was like being in a living grave with only one tiny hole high up on the wall and with cockroaches, mice, urine and faeces on the floor.' He said he was beaten up by other inmates and interrogated by five men who beat him with rubber hoses, leaving him with open wounds which became infected. He said he had seen guards beating a 12-year-old boy who was crying for his mother and had seen a prisoner kicked and beaten to death. After that, she spoke to him on the phone every day and visited him a dozen times between September and November, taking food and medicines - which he shared with other prisoners - while still putting pressure on every ministry in Damascus to obtain his release. The inquest continues.","Dr Abbas Khan was found dead in his cell days before Syrian government claimed he would be freed .

"Report: Jamie Gustafson filed a police report after she claims a Jason's Deli employee was taking photos of her as she breastfed her two-month-old son . A Texas mother filed a police report after she caught a restaurant employee taking pictures of her while she breastfed her baby Thursday, authorities say. Jamie Gustafson, of San Antonio, sat in Jason's Deli and was breastfeeding her two-month-old son when she discovered an employee taking photos of her,USA Today reports. 'I was stunned,' Gustafson told KENS 5 Eyewitness News. 'I was speechless... I wanted to take his phone and smash it.' Gustafson told KENS 5 that she never had any issues nursing her son in public up until the incident. She said that her sister confronted the employee and told management, who responded quickly. The owners of the restaurant told KENS that the employee has been fired. In a statement released by the company, officials described the employee's conduct as 'an explicit breach of written company policy' and a 'violation of the values we care about deeply.' The statement also decribed the company's support of the right of woman to breastfeed their children. Though the employee has since been fired,She Knows magazine reports that his termination came only after some profanity-laden Facebook posts were written by the employee. Gustafson told KENS that she is not upset with the company, but may not feel as comfortable as she breastfeeds in public in the future.

"The father of a British ISIS hostage has died days after making an emotional plea for his son’s release. Paul Cantlie, of Hampshire - who recorded an impassioned video message for his son John's captors earlier this month, calling on them to give the hostage up - died from complications after pneumonia. The 80-year-old’s family said he died not knowing whether John's captors had received any of the messages he had sent them. Relatives have made ‘urgent’ attempts to contact John and inform him. Scroll down for video . Complications following pneumonia: Paul Cantlie (left), who recorded an impassioned video message for the captors of his son John (right) earlier this month, calling on them to give the hostage up, has died aged 80 . The family said Paul Cantlie's physical strength had been diminishing since the kidnap of his photojournalist son, from Surrey, by jihadists two years ago, and he died on Thursday of last week. In a statement, the family said: ‘It is with great sadness that we announce that Paul Cantlie, father of Jessica, Toby and John Henry, and husband to his late wife Carol, died on the morning of Thursday 16 October, from complications following pneumonia. ‘His family have, over the last few days, urgently tried to contact John to let him know about their father's death before it is made public. ‘Many in the country will recall the recent broadcast from his hospital bed, when so demonstrably ill, but determined that his journalist son John should hear from his father “how very proud I am of him”. ‘He totally deplored what he and many others saw as an abuse of power by Tony Blair when the UK went into Iraq in 2003. With many others, he called for Tony Blair to be indicted for war crimes.’ Emotional plea: The family said Paul Cantlie's physical strength had been diminishing since the kidnap of his photojournalist son by jihadists two years ago. He is pictured above appealing to ISIS from his hospital bed . Photojournalist: John Cantlie is pictured in central London shortly before he went to Syria, where he was captured by jihadist militants in November 2012 before appearing in a video released by ISIS on September 18 . The statement added: ‘Paul died not knowing whether John's captors had received any of the messages he had sent to them. ‘The failure of communication to date has inevitably led to a terrible sense of abandonment, particularly for John's father, with the family feeling ignored. ‘This burden has been especially hard these last few days, as we have so needed to tell John that his father, whom he so loved, has died. ‘Paul Cantlie will be remembered by many for his fortitude, quiet courage, wry humour and keen intelligence, as well as for his great gentleness. ‘As life became increasingly hard, these qualities shone ever more brightly and he leaves behind a steady beacon for Jessica, Toby, John Henry and the wider family to steer by as they struggle with the realities they all currently face.’ John had been shown in a series of videos in recent weeks in which he speaks about ISIS, and criticises both the U.S. and UK governments over their strategies for dealing with the terrorists. Appeal: Jessica Cantlie (pictured), another of Paul Cantlie's children, has asked ISIS to 'reinitiate direct contact' Opinion: The family of Paul Cantlie said he 'totally deplored what he and many others saw as an abuse of power by Tony Blair (pictured) when the UK went into Iraq in 2003' John, who wears an orange jumpsuit and appears to be reading from prepared scripts each time, has said it is true he is a prisoner but claimed he had been abandoned by the Government. In a video message from his hospital bed earlier this month, the hostage's father said: ‘My family and I are trying to communicate with the Islamic State (ISIS) to deliver an important message regarding John and can only hope that it's been received as we have had no response. ‘For the first time in almost two years, we saw John when he made a televised broadcast during which he told viewers that he was still a prisoner of the Islamic State and that maybe he will live and maybe he will die. ‘As a family we experienced great relief seeing and hearing John and knowing that he is alive. This was followed by the feeling of despair and helplessness. To those holding John, please know that he is a good man. 'He sought only to help the Syrian people and I ask you for all that is sacred to help us and allow him to return home safely to those he loves and those who love him.’ ‘Paul Cantlie July 6, 1934 - October 16, 2014. ‘It is with great sadness that we announce that Paul Cantlie, father of Jessica, Toby and John Henry, and husband to his late wife Carol, died on the morning of Thursday October 16, from complications following pneumonia. Mr Cantlie's physical strength had been waning since the kidnap of his younger son, John Cantlie, nearly two years ago. His family have, over the last few days, urgently tried to contact John to let him know about their father's death before it is made public. ‘Many in the country will recall the recent broadcast from his hospital bed, when so demonstrably ill, but determined that his journalist son John should hear from his father 'how very proud I am of him'. John Henry is his youngest child and has been held by ISIS since November 2012, when he was kidnapped while reporting on the atrocities being carried out by Assad in Syria. Mr Cantlie, a retired naval architect, had been deeply concerned by the hesitancy of the UK to intervene against Assad, although like most, he was wary of making matters worse. He totally deplored what he and many others saw as an abuse of power by Tony Blair when the UK went into Iraq in 2003. With many others, he called for Tony Blair to be indicted for war crimes. ‘Paul died not knowing whether John's captors had received any of the messages he had sent to them. The failure of communication to date has inevitably led to a terrible sense of abandonment, particularly for John's father, with the family feeling ignored.

As life became increasingly hard, these qualities shone ever more brightly and he leaves behind a steady beacon for Jessica, Toby, John Henry and the wider family to steer by as they struggle with the realities they all currently face. ‘Paul Cantlie was the middle son of Lieutenant Colonel Kenneth Cantlie and Phyllis (nee Gage-Brown) and is survived by brothers Hugh and Bruce. His father designed much of the railway infrastructure throughout China and the two elder Cantlie boys were brought up in Nanking until the Japanese invasion. In his later years Paul Cantlie gave a huge amount of his time to Southampton General Hospital, where he was latterly a governor. He was following in the footsteps of his grandfather, Sir James Cantlie, who worked throughout his life for others - co-founder of the Hospital of Tropical Medicine in both London and in Hong Kong and, with his wife Mabel, co-founded both the volunteer sections of the Royal Army Medical Corps and the St John Ambulance Brigade. During the First World War, they both worked tirelessly for the Red Cross.’","Paul Cantlie, 80, of Hampshire, dies from complications after pneumonia .

"Raw: Supermarkets are trying to stop food watchdogs publishing a 'name and shame' list of stores selling campylobacter-contaminated chicken . Supermarkets have mounted a new attempt to stop food watchdogs publishing a ‘name and shame’ list of stores selling chicken contaminated with a deadly bug. The bug involved, campylobacter, is associated with 280,000 food poisoning cases a year and as many as 100 deaths, making it one of the biggest threats to public health. Yet supermarkets and farmers have failed to eradicate the bug from farms and the meat reaching the high street and homes despite pleas from health experts dating back more than a decade. The Food Standards Agency (FSA) has been conducting a survey of fresh chicken and has found evidence that 60 per cent is carrying campylobacter. The organisation is due to publish the details as early as this week and will identify which of the major retailers – Tesco, Sainsbury’s, Asda, Morrisons, the Co-op, Waitrose, and Marks & Spencer – have the best and worst contamination levels. The supermarkets are worried about a customer backlash and have been putting enormous pressure on the FSA not to name the stores involved by questioning whether the survey will produce reliable results. The chief executive of the FSA, Catherine Brown, has revealed that she recently received a letter from the British Retail Consortium (BRC), which speaks for supermarkets, trying to kill plans to name the stores. The high pressure tactics are detailed in a paper written by Miss Brown which will be discussed by the FSA board at a meeting in London tomorrow. She wrote: ‘It is disappointing that the British Retail Consortium, which speaks on behalf of retailers, has written to us again pressing us not to release the results of the retail survey and seeking to call into question the validity of the sampling plan, which they were consulted about before the survey commenced.’ The consumer group Which? has urged the FSA not to give in to the bullyboy tactics, saying consumers have a right to know whether they are at risk from handling and eating chicken. The consumer group’s executive director, Richard Lloyd, said: ‘The FSA must not bow to industry pressure but should keep their commitment to putting consumers' interests first by naming the worst performing shops for levels of campylobacter. ‘Campylobacter is responsible for thousands of cases of food poisoning, and even deaths, each year so people have a right to know these results and which retailers are not performing well.’ Chickens on sale at Tesco Extra: Companies are working on methods that could reduce contamination levels . The BRC said it was surprised at the FSA’s reaction to its letter. A spokesman said: ‘We were simply asking for confirmation that there was evidence behind the survey results which would give consumers clear information.’ He said: ‘The FSA is an evidence based organisation, however, their findings at this stage are limited, based on a very small sample.’ The BRC said retailers are absolutely committed to reducing campylobacter rates. However, it said: ‘Despite the millions that have been invested there is, currently, no commercially available proven method. ‘Research continues to look for one, but in the meantime the introduction of leak-proof packaging has been acknowledged by the FSA as being highly effective in preventing any issues when handling chicken when shopping.’ In fact, some companies are working on methods that could eradicate or reduce contamination levels. Faccenda, which is one of the UK’s biggest chicken producers, is trialling a system called SonoSteam, which uses steam and ultrasound to kill bacteria. Other options include washing the meat in a mild acid solution or flash freezing.","Campylobacter linked to 280,000 poisonings and up to 100 deaths a year .

"Ann Maguire, 61, was stabbed as she taught  at Corpus Christi Catholic College in Leeds in April . The husband of a teacher who was stabbed to death in a classroom has paid tribute to his 'beautiful, loving' wife ahead of a memorial service to celebrate her life. Hundreds of people are expected to gather today for a service for teacher Ann Maguire, 61, who was stabbed as she taught a Spanish lesson at Corpus Christi Catholic College in Leeds. The 61-year-old, who died from multiple stab wounds following the attack in April, has been described as a 'beautiful, dedicated and hard-working individual' by her family. The mother-of-two had taught at the school for more than 40 years prior to the attack and was due to retire this month. Her husband Don, 62, told the BBC he hoped the service at Leeds Town Hall today would reflect who she was. 'Ann was a very loving dedicated wife and a natural mother and it was her natural mothering qualities that I think made Ann such a wonderful teacher,' he said. 'She was a beautiful, dedicated, hard-working individual, so I hope that and the fact she had a very strong faith is reflected in this service.' The many tributes which followed her death, the first killing of a teacher in a British school since the Dunblane massacre in 1996, brought comfort and solace to the family, he said. The service will be led by Rev Monsignor John Wilson of the Catholic Diocese of Leeds and organisers say it will be 'a celebration of Mrs Maguire's life in song, on screen and through words'. A tribute video has been created in which people who knew Mrs Maguire share their memories of her and how she affected their lives. The video will be shown during the service and will be relayed to screens outside. Her daughter Emma told the BBC: 'I think what we took away was that we have so many of our own stories and memories of Mummy and we are so grateful people chose to share theirs.' Members of the public have been invited to join her family, colleagues, pupils and civic dignitaries. Those attending the service as well as schools across Leeds will take part in a minute's silence at about 12.30pm. Mrs Maguire's death on April 28 sent shockwaves through Britain and provoked an outpouring of sympathetic tributes from around the world. Flowers and messages pinned on the fences outside the school gates stretched for more than 100 metres. The mother was teaching Spanish at Corpus Christi Catholic College in Leeds (above) when she was stabbed . Hundreds are expected to gather for a memorial service in her honour. Pictured: Tributes outside the school . Many of the messages were from current and former pupils but others were from strangers who wanted to register their sadness. Around 300 people attended Mrs Maguire's funeral Mass in May. The couple have two grown-up daughters - professional dancer Emma, who has been a member of the Royal Ballet since 2002, and osteopath Kerry, who also trained as a ballerina. Mrs Maguire also brought up two of her nephews - Daniel and Andrew Poole - as her own sons after her sister Eileen's death from cancer in 1986 at 35. The Ann Maguire Arts Education Fund has been set up in her memory to provide bursaries and funding for the enhancement and personal development of young people through music, drama, language and dance. In July a court heard a 16-year-old boy had accepted responsibility for the 'unlawful killing' of the teacher. The teenager, who cannot be named for legal reasons, appeared via video link at Leeds Crown Court, which heard a trial on a murder charge was due to begin in November.

"Leon Means has been charged with killing four women, including his wife and her mother in 1989 . A former convict has been charged with killing four women - two this week and his wife and her mother after a prison escape in 1989. Leon Means, 61, confessed to the killings to Police Detective Steve White, a Muskegon Heights police officer. According to Detective White, Means admitted killing 63-year-old Anna Lawson and Judy Bushman, 62, whose bodies were found on Tuesday just blocks apart in Muskegon Heights, Michigan. Means also said he had killed his estranged wife, Cynthia Means, and her mother, Linda Herrera, after fleeing from a prison in 1989. He was initially charged with both murders, but the case was dismissed. Detective White said under oath in front of Muskegon County judge, Raymond Kostrzewa, that Means admitted to the killings in a police interview. Means told detectives that, while at Bushman's home - where he had previously lived - 'he and Miss Bushman exchanged words, and after the argument, he admitted that he killed her,' according to Detective White. He went on to confess killing 63-year-old Anna Lawson. Detective White said: 'He admitted he had been allowed in to the residence by Anna Lawson, and while he was there with Miss Lawson there was a confrontation between he and Anna Lawson, and during the confrontation he stabbed her.' Detectives also asked Means about the June 1989 murders of Means' estranged wife and her mother, White said. White said Means admitted killing both women. They were found dead on June 15, 1989, in their home in Muskegon. 'He provided detailed statements as to what occurred in that incident,' White said. Muskegon County Prosecutor DJ Hilson speaks to the media about the case. Chief Lynn Gill is pictured behind Hilson. In the background are Muskegon Heights police detectives Steve Winston and Steve White (far left) Means is pictured on a video - he admitted to killing four women, including two this week . People in support of the victims watch Means on video - Dean Herrera said he was relieved Means had finally been charged and that he had 'waited 25 years' Dean Herrera said he was relieved Means had finally been charged. He told WZZM: 'I've waited 25 years. He killed my mum and sister. He stabbed my mum over 15 times and shot her once and stabbed my sister over 30 times. 'It's sad it had to be like this, at the expense of two other women's lives. But in a way, I'm happy. I suffered a lot of years and waited.' Police arrested Means on Wednesday and he is currently being held in prison. Means has convictions for prison escape, assault, breaking and entering and robbery, according to the Michigan Corrections Department website. He had most recently been released from prison in July 2012. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Leon Means, 61, confessed to killing four women to a Police Detective .

"Earls, archbishops and famous composers are among the former residents of historic Johnstone Castle. But the 16th-century fort is not such a desirable place to live now, with a large housing estate having been built around it since the Second World War. However, the impressive tower of the castle  has been painstakingly restored to its former glory - and is now on the market for just £450,000. The home in Renfrewshire, Scotland, boasts four bedrooms, a library, dining room, huge open fireplaces, a great hall and a courtyard. But despite its grand aspect the building is far from isolated, being within walking distance of a train station - and right in the middle of an estate. Scroll down for video . Tower: Johnstone Castle in Renfrewshire boasts four bedrooms, a library, dining room, huge open fireplaces, a great hall and courtyard . Hard work: The owners have spent 14 years renovating it with modern building standards while being sensitive to the original period . Not great for tall people: It features four bedrooms, a library, grand dining room, massive fireplaces, a great hall and a courtyard . And when compared to London prices, the Scottish castle is almost the same as a garage in Kensington and half that of a studio apartment in Mayfair. Valerie Reilly, of the Johnstone Historical Society, said: ‘It was once owned by the Laird of Johnstone and was one of the grandest houses in the area. ‘What we see today is only a fraction of what the house once was. It was, at one time, a sprawling mansion. ‘But the more modern parts were pulled down and what now remains is the original 16th century tower house. ‘During the war years, it was used as a prisoner of war camp and many Germans were held there. Surrounding houses: Residents of Glasgow and elsewhere moved into the area after losing their homes during the Second World War . From above: This aerial view of the tower of Johnstone Castle shows how it is in a square surrounded by a housing estate . Light my fire: A spokesman for estate agents Savills said that castle had 'undergone a truly remarkable period-sensitive restoration' 'They would work the land and become well-known to the locals. Frederic Chopin also stayed there before performing a concert in Glasgow.’ Built in 1560, the castle has been owned by the Houston Lairds of Johnstone, the Cochrane Earls of Dundonald and the Archbishop of Glasgow. Chopin, the composer, was invited to stay by Laird Ludovic while he performed at Glasgow’s Merchant Hall. But his visit nearly ended in disaster when his horse-drawn carriage smashed into a tree while he was on his way to the concert. During the Second World War the castle was requisitioned for military purposes. Exterior: The castle and its grounds were bought by the local council in 1956 after the building was declared unsafe . Bedtime: The central tower is now all that remains of the castle, and also happens to be the oldest part of the original complex . Step up: The historic 16th century castle has been restored to its former glory and has gone onto the market for just £450,000 . It subsequently fell into disuse and in 1956 Johnstone Burgh Council acquired the castle and its grounds. The land was gradually used to build new homes, and residents of Glasgow and elsewhere moved into the area after losing their homes during the war. But the 7th Laird of Johnstone stepped in to ensure that the original tower house was preserved. When the current owner bought the castle from Renfrewshire council in 2004, he became the 8th Laird of Johnstone. The owners have spent the last 14 years renovating the castle with modern building standards while also being sensitive to the original period. Historic building: This is how the castle in Renfrewshire looked when it was a mansion, before its demolition upon being bought in 1956 . Pricier than the castle: A space in this Kensington garage near the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge’s home was up for sale for £500,000 . Double the price: This £950,000 home in London's Mayfair has a joint living and sleeping area with a small kitchenette and shower room . It features four bedrooms, a library, grand dining room, massive fireplaces, a great hall and a courtyard. A spokesman for estate agents Savills said: ‘Johnstone Castle has undergone a truly remarkable period-sensitive restoration.’ The central tower is now all that remains of the castle, and also happens to be the oldest part of the original complex. The castle is a 15-minute walk from Johnstone train station, which has services to Ayr, Glasgow, Largs and Ardrossan Harbour. It is 15 miles west of Glasgow, and the average house value in the PA5 postcode area is £133,000. The average cost of a Scottish property is £170,000.","Johnstone Castle boasts four bedrooms, library, dining room, huge open fireplaces, great hall and courtyard .

"A tour guide stunned a bus load of tourists when she launched into a racist tirade about San Francisco's Chinatown on her last day of the job. Holding a bottle of what appears to be alcohol in one hand, the woman was filmed as she told tourists exactly what she thought of the vibrant area in an expletive-laden speech. The guide even warned potential residents against moving to Chinatown, despite it being the cheapest neighbourhood in the city. Scroll down for video . A tour guide stunned a bus load of tourists when she launched into a racist tirade about San Francisco's Chinatown on her last day of the job . 'F*** your pre-school and your little pre-schoolers making all that noise at 6am when I was trying to live here,' she yelled into the microphone at the top of an open-roof tour bus. 'F*** your noise, f*** your parades, f*** your dragons, f*** this, f*** Chinatown. 'F*** your herb gardens sea food markets. 'When you come to America you've got to assimilate a little bit. And in America we don't eat turtles and frogs. 'There's a limit. F*** your laundry hanging out your windows. F*** your hair salons where no one knows how to speak English.' She claimed that when she lived in the area it was unbearably busy with too many people crowded into a small place. She claimed that when she lived in the area it was unbearably busy  and advised others not to live there . 'We have a Chinatown in my hometown LA, but it is much cleaner with better restaurants. 'This is a horrible place to live. Although this is the cheapest neighbour do not live here. There's too many of them out here.' In the video posted to YouTube by a German tourist, the guide got the occasional laugh from the group and even managed to pull a chorus of 'F--- Chinatown' as the bus headed into a tunnel. It is not certain what company the guide worked for but according to the post it was her last day. The footage  provoked a mixed response from people on Youtube, with many criticising her for the xenophobic comments. The guide even managed to pull a chorus of 'F*** Chinatown' from the tourists as the bus headed into a tunnel . Kathleen said: 'She says tons of racist things, tells Chinese people to assimilate... and then says 'I'm not racist okay'...right. Sadly, this lady really needs to be corrected- Chinatown is not the cheapest neighborhood to live in, its actually quite expensive if you can even find a place for rent or lease there- plenty of cheaper neighborhoods in the city of San Francisco. 'All the things she mentioned- herb shops, frogs, not speaking English, etc. its a part of Chinese culture- makes chinatown 'chinatown,' its not called Americatown right?' Emil Stewart said: 'Well if it wasn't her last day of work then I am sure it is now. It's a shame in a city of such diversity that she has to point out differences in each other in such a negative light.' San Francisco's Chinatown is the oldest  in North America, created by an influx of Chinese railroad workers and gold prospectors in the mid-1800s. Ethnic Chinese make up the largest minority group in the city, accounting for a little over 20 percent of the population according to 2010 Census data.

New contract: Finnish goalkeeper Jussi Jaaskelainen has signed a new one-year deal at West Ham . 'I'm delighted to sign for another season and I'm really looking forward to it,' he told West Ham's official website. 'Hopefully I can put in a proper challenge to get a starting place again. 'Physically, I feel good now and I felt good last season so I hope I can carry on from there and play football. 'You never know what is going to happen next season, but the only thing in my mind is to get myself ready to play. 'I am looking forward so that when that next chance comes, I will be in the right shape and right frame of mind to take it. That's all I'm thinking about now. Ready for action: Jaaskelainen, seen here preparing to save a shot from Sunderland's Wes Brown, will challenge Adrian for the No 1 spot at Upton Park . 'Obviously we all know that, whoever is in the squad, we all want to fight for that starting place, so let's see. We're all looking forward to next season. 'I want to try my best and I'm going to give it a proper go to play well, so the first thing I have to do is look after myself to make sure I'm in good shape and a good frame of mind.' The Finn stressed the importance of making a strong start to next season in order to avoid concerns over relegation. 'Last season was a bit disappointing as in the early part things didn't really work out because we didn't really score enough goals and then we got injury problems. Bravery: Jaaskelainen saves at the feet of Southampton's Adam Lallana during last season's meeting . 'If you look at it, we finished 13th, having had a difficult season, so it's not the end of the world. We have to make sure we're ready for this coming season. 'In our first season back in the Premier League, we started well, but last season we didn't get those points on the board early on and that's what created the pressure and all the injuries just made it worse. 'We have to make sure we're ready for this coming season so we can start well.'","Jaaskelainen, 39, to remain at Upton Park for another season .

"Nigel Farage faced fury from Jewish community leaders today after he formed a pact with a Polish MEP whose party leader has been accused of denying the Holocaust to get EU funding. The Board of Deputies of British Jews said it was 'gravely concerned' by Ukip's deal to accept a member of the Polish Congress of the new Right (KNP) into its grouping in the European Parliament. Robert Iwaszkiewicz's decision to join the Eurosceptic EFDD (Europe of Freedom and Direct Democracy) group headed by Mr Farage means it has enough members to increase its funding and standing in the parliament. Ukip leader NIgel Farage has come under pressure after his party was joined in an EU grouping by Robert Iwaszkiewicz . But Mr Iwaszkiewicz has been criticised for joking about hitting women and his party's leader has questioned whether Hitler knew about the Holocaust and suggested women are less intelligent and should not vote. Today Board of Deputies vice president Jonathan Arkush said the KNP should be 'roundly rejected' and described Mr Farage's welcoming of Mr Iwaszkiewicz in order to get money as 'beyond belief'. He said: 'Robert Iwaszkiewicz belongs to an extremist party whose leader has a history of Holocaust denial, racist remarks and misogynistic comments. 'Extremists and racists should be roundly rejected, not embraced. Even France's far right Front National rejected the (KNP) as being too extreme. 'For Ukip to choose such a figure as Robert Iwaszkiewicz as a bedfellow, apparently for money, is beyond belief. 'Nigel Farage now has some very serious questions to answer. He has placed in issue the credibility of Ukip.' But Mr Farage said his party needed to do deals to make sure its voice was heard and insisted he would not work with extremists. 'I have found nothing in this guy's background to suggest he is a political extremist at all. He has joined our group to save us,' he told BBC Radio 4's The World at One. 'All of us in the European Parliament have to make compromises to make sure that our voice is heard. I want us to have our voice, I want us to have a group, but I will not do it at any price. 'If it came to a decision that do we cast Ukip into the outer darkness of a non-attached group here or do a deal with a known prominent extremist in Europe, I would not do that deal.' Asked about the MEP's reported comment that there were 'quite a few wives around who'd be brought back down to earth' if their husbands hit them, Mr Farage, said: 'I think that comment was a joke'. But he added: 'I've never met him, I've never spoken to him.' As the row erupted, Mr Farage insisted he had never met or spoken to Mr Iwaszkiewicz . KNP leader Janusz Korwin-Mikke has been described as one of the most controversial figures in Polish politics, but Ukip emphasised that Mr Iwaszkiewicz was joining the group in a personal capacity. The EFDD was thrown into disarray last week when one its members, a Latvian MEP, quit. Groupings need to have at least 25 MEPs from seven different countries. If the group had disbanded it would have meant a loss to Ukip of about 2million euros a year in funding for its MEPs and Mr Farage would have got less speaking time in the parliament. Michael Dugher MP, Labour's shadow minister for the Cabinet Office, said: 'Here are UKIP forming an alliance with a far-right party in Europe that denies the fact that millions were murdered in the Holocaust, in order to keep receiving hundreds of thousands of pounds from the European Parliament. 'This shows once again that UKIP do not share the values of decent working people in Britain.' However Rabbi Shneur Zalman Odze, a former Ukip MEP candidate,  said: 'Robert Iwaszkiewicz was the only Polish member asked to join the EFDD Group. The only comment he made on Hitler was that he was an evil man who should have been executed. 'Korwin-Mikke is not a member of the EFDD group. 'Both UKIP Party and EFDD Group abhors and rejects any scent of anti-Semitism. As a Jewish rabbi, I was number four on the UKIP North West MEP candidate list, and I can assure you in my many years in UKIP I have never once experienced any anti-Semitism. 'All groups in the European Parliament have very odd bedfellows, for examples, the Tories are part of a pan European party aECR with Islamist AK Party of Turkey, Labour are in a Group with homophobes from Croatia. The Greens were recently led by MEP Danny Cohen-Bendit with very odd views on child sexuality. 'The rules to get Group speaking time and funding are set by the European Parliament, not by Ukip.'","Robert Iwaszkiewicz's has joined Eurosceptic EFDD group led by Farage .

"Police are hunting thieves who stole one of Britain's rarest and most valuable puppies worth a whopping £16,000 - because it's purple. The cute eight-week old British bulldog puppy called Lila is so valuable because of her lilac colouring. Officers say it was snatched from his breeder by a man who was pretending to buy the puppy. The black man with short afro hair grabbed the pup when the specialist breeder's back was turned and ran out of the home - knocking a female relative to the ground. Scroll down for video . This eight-week old puppy was stolen from his breeder in Tadworth, Surrey due to it's rare 'lilac' colouring . A missing poster has been produced as the family desperately appeal for help in tracking down the pet . He then jumped in a waiting car and his white male accomplice drove off at speed, almost hitting another member of the family outside the home in Tadworth, Surrey. The incident happened at around 8pm on Saturday and now Surrey Police are asking anybody with any information to come forward. The man who took the dog is described as around 5ft 10ins, of medium build, and had one of his top teeth missing. Investigating officer Detective Constable Eloise Lock said: 'This was a nasty incident which has left the dog breeder and her family distressed. 'The puppy is extremely distinguishable and rare because of its colour. We are hoping because of that the public can help us reunite it with the owner. 'Anyone who may have been offered the puppy or knows anything about where it might have been sold is urged to get in touch with us.' Lila was one of a number of bulldog puppies being bred by the owner at her home in Tadworth, Surrey . The woman has now installed CCTV at her property to ensure the snatch and grab raid is not repeated . Lilac-coloured British bulldogs are so valuable because of their rarity, but they are not recognised by the Kennel Club as an official colour, so are not often used for dog shows. A spokesperson for the British Bulldog Club said: 'Everything has a worth to someone, and if the breeder thinks their lilac puppy is worth £16,000 then that's what it's worth. 'Lilac-coloured bulldogs are more suitable to be pets rather than show dogs, because the Kennel Club do not recognise their colour as standard.' Pedigree British bulldog pups usually sell for around £2,000, but the 'lilac' ones are much more expensive as they are seen as more desirable. Lila, who has been microchipped, is believed to be one of the only lilac pedigree bulldogs in Britain - leading to her huge price tag. The dog who has been stolen, who was one of a number kept at the property, has been microchipped . Other rare breeds of puppy at the dog breeder's home are up for sale from £600 to over £2,000 . The breeder, who asked not to be named, said: 'She is worth from around £10,000 to £16,000. I don't sell my puppies to other breeders, only as pets. 'The ironic thing is that I hadn't even discussed money with the man, who said his name was James. The second I turned my back, he just grabbed her and ran off, barging past my daughter and niece.' Lila is one of a litter of four, specially bred from selected stock to produce gorgeous, lilac-coloured puppies. Her owner also breeds French bulldogs and Shar Pei pups, as well as British bulldogs like Lila. To secure other litters, she has now installed CCTV cameras outside her home, and is launching an online campaign to try to find her stolen pup.","Expensive British bulldog pup snatched from owner in violent theft .

"Guilty: Ashley Clark, 23, was jailed for 21 months at Burnley Crown Court following a series of drunken incidents after his discharge from the Army . A soldier who was brain damaged in an explosion in Afghanistan that a court heard killed two of his comrades has been jailed after a series of drunken offences. Ashley Clark, 23, who served with the 2nd Battalion of the Duke of Lancaster’s regiment, started drinking to 'self-medicate' after seeing his friends fatally wounded. Captain Andrew Griffiths, 25, and Kingsman Darren Deady, 22, died within weeks of the explosion, the court heard, while Clark was left with 'life changing injuries' and was forced to leave the Army. Burnley Crown Court heard how Clark, now a web designer, found it very difficult to cope with civilian life and - even though he had recently started to tackle his problems - Judge Andrew Woolman said it was too late in the day. Clark had lost his temper and racially abused a taxi driver, ranting and swearing and calling him a terrorist, in the early hours of July 25 last year. He had then kicked off when police arrived, struggling with them, biting a female officer on the arm and booting her colleague in the shin. Three months later, he was arrested again for being drunk and disorderly. During the deferment period, Clark had been one of two people involved in a sustained attack, again on a taxi driver, who was punched and subjected to a number of kicks after he was knocked to the ground. The victim suffered a cut to his bottom lip and grazing to his eye, knee and elbow after the outburst in March. The hearing was told how the defendant had had a sentence deferred by the judge last December - giving Clark a chance to improve his behaviour. But his problems continued and he has now been jailed. All the offences were committed during a suspended sentence for a burglary he had carried out on his aunt and uncle’s farmhouse in nearby Rossendale. Clark’s barrister said he had recently attended an alcohol treatment course and had made good progress. He did receive some counselling and had made positive changes in his life, but clearly needed help. The former soldier was jailed for 21 months. He had admitted racially aggravated threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour, two counts of police assault, being drunk and disorderly and common assault and was in breach of the suspended term. He has 11 offences on his record. Judge Woolman told Clark he had deferred sentence partly because of his 'horrific experience' in Afghanistan when Clark was in a vehicle which was blown up and witnessed the death of two fellow soldiers. Career: Clark (pictured left) who served with served with the 2nd Battalion of the Duke of Lancaster’s regiment in Afghanistan, was suffered 'life-changing injuries' in a roadside bomb attack . The court heard how Clark turned to drinking to self-medicate following his medical discharge from the Army - leading to a number of drunken incidents, including racially abusing a taxi driver . The judge said: 'I had no doubt that all that was having a considerable impact upon your behaviour. I thought there was a chance that if I gave you another opportunity you might sort yourself out. That would have been to everybody’s benefit. 'I gave you a chance on December 13 and nobody could say that you have taken it. I said you had got to keep away from alcohol and seek help and go to Salute and other organisations, although belatedly you might have done. When you left court on December 13, that was your last chance. 'I recognise to an extent I am undoing the good work you have now started and it may set you back, but you have only yourself to blame.' The incident that killed Captain Griffiths, and injured Clark was featured in a BBC Three documentary Our War in 2012. It featured uncensored footage captured on the helmet cameras of comrades during a daring three-day operation, codenamed Hornet’s Nest, when troops were sent deep into enemy territory in Helmand Province. Comrades: Captain Andrew Griffiths, 25, (left) and Kingsman Darren Deady, 22, were both killed while they were serving with Clark in Afghanistan . Downfall: Clark, pictured during his tour in Afghanistan, had 11 offences to his name and - despite his problems - the judge said he had no one to blame but himself . While the above story is an accurate report of the court proceedings, the Ministry of Defence has asked us to clarify the facts concerning the deaths of Kingsman Darren Deady and Captain Andrew Griffiths in Afghanistan.  It states: ‘Kingsman Deady was shot defending a compound in Helmand Province on 23 August 2010 and died of his wounds on 10 September at Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham.  Capt Griffiths was injured by an improvised explosive device inside a compound on 24 August 2010 while leading his troops on patrol in Helmand.  He died of his wounds on 5 September 2010 at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital. ’","Ashley Clark served with the 2nd Battalion the Duke of Lancaster's regiment .

"A black market surgery victim too ashamed to date after being turned into a 'monster' has undergone a dramatic transformation. Rajee Narinesingh, 46, from Miami, was dubbed 'cement face' after a fake medic pumped a concrete-like filler into her cheeks, lips, breasts and buttocks. But, thanks to a kind-hearted doctor, her previously 'hard-as-rock' face is much improved and she is now swamped by admirers. Scroll down for video . Rajee Narinesingh was too ashamed to date but is now fighting off men after having her face fixed . She said: 'For years I was too ashamed and embarrassed to face dating. 'Now I'm feeling more confident and with a good bit of makeup I can achieve somewhat of an exotic look. 'Recently this guy said that being with me is like being with a sexy dragon. I didn't know whether to slap him or kiss him.' Rajee, who was born a man, is given monthly softening injections and laser therapy by Dr John Martin of Coral Gables Cosmetic Reconstructive Surgery, Miami. This has helped reduce the size of the nodules on her face. The self-confessed cougar has grown in confidence and is now a regular on the Miami dating scene and has been flooded with romantic requests online. Rajee's face following black-market injections in Miami, Florida . She said: 'A lot of the men I date are straight and so they like to do a lot of dating under the radar.'That can be really hard to deal with. But now my confidence is up I feel like I could meet a boyfriend or a husband who loves me for who I am. 'I definitely deserve more than just the 3 o'clock in the morning knock on the window.' The transgender activist has also been buoyed by the news that the fake doctor who operated on her has been jailed. Oneal Ron Morris, 32, herself a transgendered woman, was jailed for 366 days in January after admitting one count of practicing healthcare without a license. Morris reportedly injected Fix-a-Flat, Super Glue and mineral oil into the buttocks of women during illegal cosmetic surgeries. Rajee, who was born in New York but grew up in Philadelphia, was bullied at school. She said: 'Up . until I was in my mid-twenties I just thought I was a feminine gay . male. I thought about all the things I did when I was growing up - . like taking the basketball my dad had bought me and instead of playing . basketball with it I was simulating pregnancy and actually pretending to . give birth and be a mommy. 'When I used to fantasise about . being with guys I used to always picture myself with breasts and a . vagina. I didn't realise I was doing it, it was just so natural for me. One day I just connected all the dots and thought 'you're not gay, . you're transgender.' Rajee, who had been too 'embarrassed and ashamed' to go to the authorities, says she paid just £60 per session to Morris for the life-changing injections back in 2005. Rajee as a boy (left) and before her transformation (right) - she previously thought she was a 'feminine man' She said: 'The last thing I wanted was to look like a man in a dress. I wanted to be a beautiful woman. 'If you really want to live your authentic self as a woman you need to do some sort of face and body reconstruction. 'So I made the choice to get injections done. In our community it is called 'pumping'.' She . told Miami television station CBS4 at the time: 'It becomes so dire . that you want to match your outside with your inside that you're willing . to roll the dice and take your chances. 'As . a transgender person, you're thinking, ""Oh, my God, I can start to look . like I want to look like and I don't have to spend a lot of money.""' Rajee, born a man, soon realised she was a woman in a man's body . 'When . it finally came to the day, I was more excited than nervous because I . was finally going to be the woman I had always wanted to be. 'There was a room that she had set up where she did a lot of medical procedures. 'It . appeared to be pretty sterile. It was like an extra bedroom that she . had turned into a clinical area and I would go in and pay the money. 'I got injections in my face and my hips and my buttocks and initially I was fine. But then the nightmare started. 'It first felt like a huge boil on the side of my face and then it kept getting bigger and bigger as the day went along. 'It . got really painful and then suddenly green pus exploded out of my face . and onto the mirror. It was green and yellow and mixed with blood. It . was terrible. She added: 'Sometimes I wake up in bed in the middle of the night and I ask myself: 'What have you done? 'My . message to anyone that would consider doing what I did is don't do it. Do not do it. You could die or you could end up like me: disfigured.' Rajee, . who spent a total of £1,825 ($3,000) over 10 months on the injections, . spent years in solitude suffering from post-traumatic stress, depression . and agoraphobia. Rajee was left with hard lumps in her face, pictured, following black-market injections . Ron Oneal Morris, 32, pictured in court, accepts a sentence of 366 days in prison for illegal practice of healthcare in October . But her life changed when two years later a friend referred her to Dr Martin, who offered to help her for free. The operations she has had and is having with Dr John Martin are kenalog facial injections, laser surgery and ultrasound. These help reduce the size of the nodules in her face. She . also had two invasive surgeries earlier in her treatment with Dr John . Martin. In the first one his scissor broke while trying to remove the . filler because the lumps were 'as hard as concrete'. He said: 'The progress Rajee is making is actually much better than I had ever hoped or expected. 'We thought that the . nodules would probably just soften up a little bit - but there are now . some areas on her face where they actually seem to have gone away. 'The future for Rajee's face is much more positive but I worry about the inflammation in the rest of her body. 'She . has had a a really large volume of substance injected into both her . breasts and buttocks and we're not quite sure what it is.' He added: 'This sort of black-market . surgery is probably the worst thing you could do. You're lucky if you . just develop nodules. Other people have lost limbs or even died.' Dr Martin's technician treats Rajee Narinesingh at a clinic in Hollywood, Florida . For now Rajee says she plans to continue to enjoy her life as best she can with her tight-knit network of friends. And while she will always continue to suffer the effects of the injections, she is determined to enjoy life - and love - once again. She said: 'I feel like I have somehow managed to turn lemons into lemonade. I am finally starting a new chapter in my life. 'With Dr Martin helping me to improve my looks a great deal I'm feeling much more confident and optimistic for the future. 'I've gone from being victim to victorius.'

"Leaving an expensive device on a plane usually means waving it goodbye forever. But one passenger was shocked when airline staff not only returned his lost iPad, but left him a few surprise happy snaps as a souvenir. Stepan Hruda, from New York, left the device on the plane after flying with Icelandair to Keflavik in Iceland three weeks ago. Scroll down for video . Service with a selfie: Passenger Stepan Hruda was surprised to find these humorous selfies on his returned iPad after he left it on an Icelandair flight . After contacting the airline, he was thrilled to learn that it had been located, and collected the device when he arrived to catch his outbound flight. It was only upon his return to the States that Hruda noticed two extra photographs in the iPad image gallery. The two cheeky 'selfies' appear to have been snapped by Icelandair cabin and ground crew. In the first shot, two female cabin crew members smile broadly for the shot, one clutching a cup of coffee. The second selfie sees two male ground grew wearing Hi Vis vests pulling funny faces. Speaking to MailOnline Travel, Hruda revealed that he was a few days into his Icelandic hiking trip before noticing his iPad was missing. I don't remember taking that: The airline pranksters found the device after the flight from New York to Keflavik and ensured it was safely returned to its owner - but not before taking some happy snaps . 'Great customer experience': Stepan says he's just relieved to get the iPad back and thinks the crew stunt is 'hilarious' 'I didn’t realise I lost the device until two days later, when swimming in a hot pot in the middle of nowhere in Northern Iceland,' he said. 'I was kind of in peace with it being gone, but I got faith in humanity and tweeted to Icelandair about it. 'They got me in touch with the airport police and we resolved that they got my iPad when (I was) still on the road! 'I picked my iPad up when flying out from Keflavik on another trip to Spain, 10 days after I lost it. I didn’t find the pictures until getting back home to NYC.' Hruda, an iOS developer, uploaded the humorous images to popular sharing site Reddit seven days ago. The post has gone viral, amassing more than 1.36 million views so far. 'I immediately realised what happened there and thought it was hilarious, so I put them on Reddit and the thread exploded,' Hruda said. 'The two guys from the picture actually got in touch with me through Reddit and Twitter, so I could even thank them in person.' Some Reddit users pointed out that posting the images online could lead to disciplinary action against the Icelandair crew, but Hruda says that it had not occurred to him - he was just relieved to have his iPad returned. 'I find it amazing and it makes me like IcelandAir even more, so I hope no one gets in trouble for this,' he wrote on Reddit. Lost and found: Icelandair promptly returned the iPad after Hruda contacted them, but it is as yet unknown what they make of their employees' prank . 'Just to reiterate: This was a great customer experience, I am very happy I got my iPad back and I hope no one gets silly and tries to give these nice employees s*** for it.' Hruda's iPad is locked with a passcode, without which potential thieves can only take photos - they cannot access the image gallery or any other content on the device.

"Rosalie Atkins offers her tips for kids travelling alone . Rosalie Atkins, 11, was the subject of controversy when her mother Anne Atkins wrote in  MailOnline about her adventurous five children and how she has no problem with them travelling alone. Rosalie, who flew to Lyon solo when she was nine, is a frequent train traveller making the 200-mile, three-and-a-half hour journey from home Bedford to Durham Chorister School, where she boards. Usually she's dropped at Sandy and changes only at Peterborough, but at the weekend she made the entire journey on her own - changing at Sheffield and Leicester - for the first time. Rosalie wasn't worried one bit, and here she offers her 10 top tips for other kids making a journey on their lonesome. 1 Allow time . When planning a journey, allow plenty of time for everything. For instance, if you book in advance, the tickets are much cheaper. Also it helps you to make sure you will be able to get to the station: make sure you allow plenty of time for this. You may think you have enough time, but there might be roadworks or an accident, which could make you miss your train. My mother told me we needed to allow forty minutes for a twenty minute drive to the station I need for school. I thought she was being silly until the day when there was a long diversion, and we arrived to see my train pulling out. Rosalie Atkins gets set for a solo train journey - the 11-year-old travels 200 miles from her family's home in Bedford to Durham Chorister School regularly and has also travelled overseas by herself . 2 Plan carefully . Make sure you know precisely when your train will get in and what platform it will come in on, especially if you are doing a change. My older brother looks all this up on the internet for me before my journey. He even prints off a map of the station, showing my platform change and how far it is from one platform to the other, if I haven’t done that change before. 3 Check everything . It is very useful to have a pack list when you are going on a journey, so that you know you have everything. When you leave your house make sure you check you have everything with you that you will need, and when you leave the platform or the train make sure you keep your belongings with you at all times. (It is often a good idea if you need to go to the loo, to ask someone to watch your belongings for you.) If you got on the train with three things – for instance: book, bag, coat – make sure you get off with three things too. Rosalie arrives back at her home station at Bedford (left) after another solo train journey . 4 Take Entertainment . If you are taking a long train journey and you don’t take entertainment you will become extremely bored. It’s a good idea always to take a book when you are going on a journey even if you don’t think you will want to read it. If you don’t have any entertainment, don’t be afraid to socialise with others around you. It can be useful to have a pack of cards. You can normally judge if the person next to you will be a sensible and friendly person to engage in a conversation. Most people are. 5 Take a telephone . And make sure you charge it up first and have credit on it! If it is one of your first journeys alone, it is always a good idea to stay in contact with someone, so that in the unlikely event of something going wrong, there is someone you can tell. Even if you don’t have a phone, the train managers are guaranteed to have one you can borrow. Always make sure you bring someone’s telephone number. Rosalie, now 11, travelled to Lyon by herself  when she was nine. She advises young travellers to plan carefully . 6 Don’t Panic . If something does go wrong (which it rarely does, but you might miss a connection for instance) the last thing you should do is panic. Stay calm and look for an information desk or phone someone at home who can tell you what to do. Anne Atkins (right) has no problems with her children, including Rosalie (left), travelling alone . 7 Recognise uniforms . If you need to tell someone something or if you have any questions about your journey, always look for someone who is working with the company that is running your train. Try to check, before you set off, what the uniform looks like, so they are easier to identify during the journey. 8 Be Confident and Assertive . If you do see someone in uniform, or just someone to talk to, never refrain from going and asking for help. It is always better to be safe than sorry, so even if you are almost sure you are on the right platform, if you have any doubts, never be worried to ask a member of staff. 9 Be Sensible . Its very unusual that something will go wrong, and even if it does, there is almost always an easy solution. Taking a journey on your own is all about common sense. For instance, it’s obviously safer to get into a carriage with lots of different people in it. And if the train is running late for your connection, you ask the train manager to advise you what to do next. You can always ring your parents. If you are sensible and careful, and your journey has been properly planned, it is extremely unlikely that anything can go wrong. 10 Relax and Enjoy Your Journey . Try not to get worried or stressed about your journey. It can often be very relaxing travelling alone (especially as your parents aren’t there to embarrass you). I’ve met lots of interesting people travelling alone, and I’ve learnt a lot from it. Enjoy your journey.","Rosalie Atkins has travelled on trains by herself since she was nine years old .

"Charges have been filed against five suspected bullies accused of dumping a bucket of urine, tobacco and spit on an autistic teen who thought he was taking part in the ice bucket challenge for charity. Each of the five teens was charged in juvenile court with disorderly conduct. Three were also charged with delinquency and assault. The teens, who range in age from 14 to 16, were not named.. According to a press release from Cuyahoga County Prosecutor Timothy McGinty, the underage suspects and the special-needs victim were friends who regularly socialized together. They attend Bay High School in suburban Cleveland. Scroll down for video . Getting their just desserts: This 15-year-old autistic boy from Ohio agreed to take the ALS ice bucket challenge, not knowing that the teens who asked him to do it were playing a sick prank on him; now, his tormentors have been charged . Humiliating: Standing in his underwear outside a garage, the teen was doused with a mixture of urine, feces, saliva and cigarette butts . Authorities say the teen felt humiliated when he discovered that it was urine and other bodily fluids dumped on him instead of ice water. The 15-year-old boy was filmed on August 18 standing under a garage in his underwear before the bucket of brown slurry was tipped on his head from off-screen. The clip, filmed in Bay Village in Ohio, sparked an outcry when it emerged in early September, prompting appeals to track down those responsible. Now, the three teens facing more serious charges will have to come to the local police station to surrender and be booked. They will then be released pending an initial court appearance. The other two suspects will be summoned to appear before the Juvenile Court Intake and Diversion Office. Cyber-bullying: The teen's tormentors used his cell phone to record the prank and upload it onto Instagram . First Assistant County Prosecutor Duane Deskins stated in the press release that the sick ice bucket challenge 'crossed a moral and legal line, and even the five alleged perpetrators understand that and have expressed regret.' The victim's family have been consulted and they agree with the charges, according to the prosecutors. The sickening video of the prank was filmed on the victim's own mobile phone and then posted to the Instagram social network. According to the boy's mother, who gave her name only as Diane so as to protect her son's identity, the victim was so embarrassed by the cruel prank that he wanted to keep it a secret. But when his family discovered the clip, they decided to share it more widely to raise awareness of how he had been bullied. Horrified: The 15-year-old's mother, Diane, later discovered the shocking video on her son's phone . Justice: The boy's parents and his older brother (center) have been consulted about the charges agaisnt his alleged tormentors . Diane told the Fox8 news station last month that the bullies had perverted the charitable aims of the Ice Bucket Challenge - which is meant to raise cash and awareness for ALS, a muscle-wasting disease. She said: 'The bucket challenge is supposed to be raising awareness for this disease and now they’ve turned it into a sick joke. I just can’t understand why kids would do something this cruel.’","Foul mixture was dumped on unsuspecting boy, 15, in Bay Village, Ohio, in August .

The vast majority of Ebola's estimated 9,000 victims and 4,500 fatalities have occurred in West Africa. But the United States has been on high alert since the virus claimed its first victim on U.S. soil, when Thomas Duncan succumbed to the deadly disease on October 8.

Two nurses who were treating Mr Duncan also contracted the disease. But both Nina Pham and Amber Vinson are thought to be in stable condition after treatment for the deadly virus. The growing sense of panic in the United States over the spread of the deadly disease has seen a number of people - particularly those traveling by air - donning protective masks and gloves, CNBC reported. This is despite the fact that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has made clear that the virus is not airborne and is only spread through contact with the bodily fluids of an infected person who is showing symptoms of the virus.

At the weekend, President Barack Obama spoke out to urge Americans not to succumb to hysteria over Ebola, warning that travel restrictions between the U.S. and West Africa could 'make the situation worse'. Speaking in his weekly radio and internet address, Obama told listeners: 'Trying to seal off an entire region of the world - if that were even possible - could actually make the situation worse.' He added: 'This is a serious disease, but we can't give in to hysteria or fear because that only makes it harder to get people the accurate information they need. We have to be guided by the science.'","Mask 'provides complete protection while remaining light and comfortable'

"A trip to Bali has turned Dylan Thomas into a real-life Spiderman. The 21-year-old was holidaying with friends last weekend when he woke up to find a strange red trail stretching up his stomach. Doctors told Mr Thomas  he had just been bitten by a small insect when he fronted Bali International Medical Centre on Sunday morning after the red mark started to grow in length, the NT News reports. Scroll down for video . Dylan Thomas, 21, was holidaying with friends last weekend when he woke up to find a strange red trail stretching up his stomach . Doctors at Bali International Medical Centre initially thought he had just been bitten by a small insect and gave him an antihistamine. When it started to blister the next day, he knew some was wrong . So imagine his surprise when doctors discovered a tropical spider burrowing just below his skin a day later. Mr Thomas, who recently returned to his Bunbury home in Western Australia, was initially given an antihistamine cream to treat the mark. But the next morning when he found it had started to blister, Mr Thomas went to see a dermatologist. Doctors retrieved the spider from his abdomen, which had burrowed its way through a small scar from a previous operation where he had his appendix removed . The 21-year-old has since returned to his Bunbury home in WA but is yet to find out what kind of spider it was . Doctors retrieved the spider from his abdomen, which had burrowed its way through a small scar from a previous operation where he had his appendix removed. 'It was a bit bigger than the size of a match head,' Mr Thomas told the newspaper. 'It takes a lot to deter me, but I do feel violated. It was a very bizarre experience just to know something like that was in my body for a couple of days.' The tropical spider was taken away for testing and Mr Thomas will soon be told exactly what kind of spider it was.","Dylan Thomas, 21, was holidaying in Bali last week when he noticed a red trail appearing on his stomach .

"Former President Bill Clinton returned to Arkansas on Monday to boost his party's sluggish fortunes and urge voters not to tie liberal politicians too closely to their unpopular fellow Democrat in the White House with an angry 'protest vote' in November. Clinton, a five-term Arkansas governor before he won the presidency in 1992, said in the town of Conway he has become 'sick and tired of people trying to stir people up, make them foam at the mouth and vote for what they're against instead of what they are for.' 'How many times have we seen people do something they knew better than to do just 'cause they were in a snit?' he asked while he stumped for Democratic Sen. Mark Pryor. Clinton doubled down on Tuesday, telling a university crowd in Fayetteville, Ark. to put 'resentment' aside and support Democrats even if they're disappointed in President Barack Obama. Bubba's homecoming: Former President Bill Clinton (right) embraces Sen. Mark Pryor (left) as he trails in a tough re-election fight, even though President Barack Obama has been kept at arms' length . No coattails: The unpopular Obama has kept a low profile in midterm campaigns, as his tanking numbers have forced him into a background fundraising role that keeps the media on the sidelines . 'Why are all these people trying to get you to cast resentment votes?' he asked a young audience. 'You’re too young. You should be voting for what you’re for. ... You should be voting for your dreams.' Republicans, he in both speeches, are busy connecting political dots between Obama and Democratic U.S. Senate candidates. Clinton has good reason to worry about that: The GOP needs to pick up just six seats to regain control of the Senate and control both houses of Congress. Most polls show that goal is within reach. Obama's coat-tails went from long to short as his Affordable Care Act played out across kitchen tables, and have all but disappeared with his handling of foreign Islamist terror groups and a relentless stream of domestic scandals. And Pryor himself isn't doing Obama any favors: Like most Democratic Senate candidates, he has kept the president at arm's length throughout his campaign. The president has found himself relegated to the role of private fundraiser, appearing at 56 high-dollar events that benefit Democratic Senate candidates even as few of them want to be seen with Obama in public. Arkansans still hold a grudge against the president from his thrashing of native daughter Hillary Clinton in the 2008 Democratic primary. And 'the other thing,' he said August 2, 'is if you look at the president's policies, he just doesn't offer a lot to states like Arkansas. He doesn't offer a lot to rural America.' It's not uncommon for second-term presidents to drag their parties down during a midterm congressional election. Clinton pushed back against that possibility on Tuesday, blaming college-age voters for sitting out elections when there's no presidential contest. 'The reason this keeps happening,' he said, 'is you don’t show up in midterms!' He insisted that off-year midterms are 'every bit as important to your future as elections when there is a presidential candidate on the ballot.' But his larger theme was castigating Republicans for generating anger against Obama, saying Monday that 'they want you to make this a protest vote.' 'They’re saying, ""You may like these guys, but hey, you know what you gotta do, you gotta vote against the president. After all, it’s your last shot."" It’s a pretty good scam, isn't it?' No 'protest' votes: Clinton tried out a last-ditch strategy to encourage Democrats to vote in November even if they're disillusioned by an underperforming Obama presidency . Still packing them in: Clinton draws large crowds in the state where he was governor beginning in 1978 at the young age of 32 . 'The Bush Record,' blared bold letters on the screen, was 'The worst economic record of any President in the last 50 years. Nothing could be more frightening than four more years.' Perot won 17 per cent of the vote, due in part to Clinton capitalizing on Bush's flagging popularity. But in his post-presidency dotage, and with  Obama's own approval rating approaching gloomy Jimmy Carter-like numbers, Clinton has found the religion of positivism. That might not be enough to keep Pryor in office. The Real Clear Politics average of polls puts his opponent, Republican Ton Cotton, in the lead by nearly 4 percentage points. 'Ummmmmmm': Sen. Mark Pryor has more than President Obama's shrinking coattails to worry about, judging from his incoherent answer to questions about the White House's handling of the Ebola crisis . And Pryor attracted national attention of the worst kind on Monday when he offered incoherent answers to questions about the White House's response to the re-emergence of the Ebola virus. Asked during an MSNBC interview whether the Obama administration 'has done an appropriate job handling the Ebola crisis,' Pryor let out a long 'Uuuuuuuummm' and looked like a deer caught in headlights. 'I would say that – it’s, uh, it’s hard to know, uh, because, uh, I haven’t heard the latest briefing on that to know all the details,' the senator said. 'I mean, I read the paper and all, but my impression is that we have people over there, both from CDC and other medical-type people and even some engineers, to try to build, um, you know, medical facilities.' Pryor later released a statement admitting that in the past, 'I have given better answers to tougher questions.'","Former president was in Arkansas to stump for Dems caught in the path of a potential Republican landslide .

"Travel companies have revealed that bookings for African safari holidays have dropped by up to 70 per cent following the deadly Ebola outbreak. Tour operators say demand for holidays in traditional safari hotspots such as Kenya in east Africa has plummeted in recent months, despite being almost 3,000 miles away from the Ebola-stricken countries of the west. Industry leaders say holiday bookings to Africa were edging towards an all-time high this year before declining rapidly in July as panic over the deadly disease set in. Travel companies have revealed that bookings for African safari holidays have dropped by up to 70 per cent following the deadly Ebola outbreak . A survey based on feedback from more than 500 safari operators conducted by African booking company Safaribookings.com found that as of late September, more than half reported a 20 to 70 percent decline in bookings. The safari industry in Africa is said to be worth more than £20bn each year. Safaribookings.com founder Wouter Vergeer told CNN the impact is most noticeable in East Africa, home to safari hotspots such as Kenya's Masai Mara and Tanzania's Serengeti. ‘Most people don't realise how vast Africa is and that east and southern Africa are just as far from the outbreak area as Europe or South America,’ said Vergeer. ‘All safari countries have enacted strict precautionary measures and as there currently are no Ebola cases the risk of infection is effectively zero.’ Enquiries for treks to Kilimanjaro in Tanzania have also reportedly suffered as a result of the Ebola epidemic . Traditional safari destinations such as South Africa, Zambia, Botswana, Uganda, Tanzania and Kenya are far from the Ebola-afflicted regions of Liberia, Guinea, Nigeria and Sierra Leone. A flight from Nairobi to Monrovia, Liberia, is more than 3,000 miles away. However, there has been widespread panic about the disease, which kills more than 70 per cent of those infected. Eastern and southern African countries have already implemented emergency measures to control the spread of the Ebola virus with some banning travellers who have visited affected countries. However, Jake McCormick, a safari specialist with Shadows of Africa, said the Ebola outbreak has caused a 70 per cent decrease in inquiries at his company, which offers tours in Tanzania, Kenya, Rwanda and Zanzibar. And Brett Thomson, managing director of Sun Safaris, said that bookings down by 50 per cent compared to last year. The worst affected countries in Africa are in the west of the continent in Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea - more than 3,000 miles away from safari hotspots of eastern and southern African such as Kenya and Tanzania . A survey of more than 500 safari operators conducted by African booking company Safaribookings.com found that as of late September, more than half reported a 20 to 70 percent decline in bookings . Health workers carry a body to a nearby burial site in Bomi county, on the outskirts of Monrovia, Liberia . Charlie Bateson, product director of high-end travel company Abercrombie & Kent said that some clients were mis-informed about the disease. ‘Although the Ebola virus is not airborne at this time and can only be caught through coming in contact with the bodily fluids of an infected person, and is currently limited to destinations in West Africa, we have recently experienced a small number of clients deferring their holiday plans to the rest of the continent,’ he said. ‘We remain in constant contact with the FCO, WHO and with tourist boards and our supplier partners across the world. ‘Our tour consultants are given the latest news on developments and have the ability to specifically advise clients on how the virus is transmitted so that they are able to allay clients fears.’ As of the October 17, the World Health Organization (WHO) have reported a total of 9,693 suspected cases of Ebola and 4,811 deaths from the disease since the outbreak started in December last year. More than half of the deaths have been in Liberia. There could be up to 10,000 new Ebola cases per week in the three hardest-hit nations by the end of the year, the WHO said. Bystanders look at a health worker in protective clothing after he and his colleagues removed the body of a woman suspected of having died after contracting the Ebola virus in Liberia . According to the World Tourism Organization's 2014 global travel report, tourism to Africa was due to increase by up to six per cent this year before the epidemic took hold. The continent had already experienced a growth of five per cent in 2012 - the equivalent of three million more tourists, to reach 56 million. Botswana is one country that has suspended entry for travellers who have visited the affected countries including Liberia, Guinea, Nigeria and Sierra Leone in the last 30 days. In Tanzania, all major border posts have mandatory health screening in place, including all international airports. South Africa refuses to admit foreign citizens arriving from Ebola-affected countries in West Africa, while South African citizens will be allowed to re-enter, but only after being subject to strict screening.","Safari hotspots are 3,000 miles away from Ebola-stricken western countries .

"The mother of Ebola-stricken nurse Amber Vinson said today that her daughter is doing well and the family is relieved new guidelines for treating patients with the virus were now in place. Debra Berry made the comments during an interview on Tuesday on Good Morning America. Miss Vinson, 29, is being cared for in a specialized unit at Emory University Hospital near Atlanta, Georgia. Scroll down for video . Confident: Amber Vinson, 29, (pictured left) contracted Ebola while caring for 'patient zero' Thomas Eric Duncan. She is now at Emory in Atlanta and her mother Debra Berry (right) said she has faith in her care . Ms Berry said the family is 'very confident' that Miss Vinson is receiving good care at Emory. Miss Vinson was part of the team that cared for Thomas Eric Duncan at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital in Dallas. Another nurse there also became infected. Mr Duncan, 42, died on October 8. In a statement released by Miss Vinson's family on Sunday, they said the nurse would never 'knowingly' put anybody at risk, was vigilant in testing herself for signs, and followed all the relevant protocols. The statement attacked any suggestion that she ignored medical or government guidelines. The statement added: 'In the interest of Amber and our family, we have retained esteemed attorney Billy Martin to provide us with legal counsel during this unfortunate and troubling time.' Miss Vinson flew from Dallas to Cleveland on October 10 and flew back on October 13. She was hospitalized with the virulent illness hours after her return last week. In the wake of the nurse's trip to plan her upcoming wedding, 153 people are being monitored for signs of the disease, and three are in quarantine. Medical staff who care for patients with Ebola are allowed to fly provided they were wearing protective gear while dealing with the virus. The statement said she reported her body temperature three times before boarding her flight home last week. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has acknowledged Miss Vinson checked in repeatedly and was cleared for travel. Nurse Nina Pham, 26, was being treated at the National Institutes of Health for Ebola . Cleveland station WOIO reported the family's statement and said that they feel public comments and media outlets 'mischaracterize Amber and her actions'. It said: 'Suggestions that she ignored any of the physician and government-provided protocols recommended to her are patently untrue and hurtful. 'Although the majority of the correspondences we have received since her diagnosis have been positive, we are troubled by some of the negative public comments and media coverage that mischaracterize Amber and her actions. 'To be clear, in no way was Amber careless prior to or after her exposure to Mr. Thomas Eric Duncan. She has not and would not knowingly expose herself or anyone else.' Three people have been quarantined in northeast Ohio following Vinson's visit to Cleveland to prepare for her wedding. None of the three, quarantined after new monitoring guidelines by the state, has exhibited Ebola-like symptoms. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released new guidelines on Monday aimed at protecting health workers treating Ebola patients. The CDC stipulates that medical personnel coming in contact or treating Ebola patients must cover all skin and hair. The previous set of guidelines - based on those from the World Health Organization - only required a mask and goggles. Medical staff were previously required to only don a face shield, leaving some skin exposed, as shown by a nurse transporting a Texas deputy who had visited the apartment of Thomas Eric Duncan (left). New guidelines require all skin to be covered (right) The new guidelines also require healthcare workers to have hands-on training putting on and taking off protective equipment and to be supervised while suiting up before treating a patient. Personal protective equipment, or PPE, for treating patients of the virus now includes a gown or coverall, disposable hoods, a respirator with face shield, boot covers and double gloves. The CDC is strengthening its protocols in the wake of two nurses contracting the virus, which is spread through direct contact with bodily fluids and tissue, after treating Mr Duncan. Miss Vinson's colleague, 26-year-old nurse Nina Pham, is being cared for at the National Institute for Health in Bethesda, Maryland after contracting the virus last week. The CDC has been widely criticized for its handling of Ebola cases diagnosed in the U.S. Amber Vinson reportedly spoke to a CDC official who cleared her to fly on a commercial flight with a fever of 99.5F after having treated Mr Duncan. On Monday, 43 people were declared risk-free after being monitored for 21 days because they came in direct or indirect contact with Mr Duncan, who was diagnosed with Ebola after flying from Liberia last month. As of October 17, WHO reported the hemorrhagic fever has infected around 9,000 and killed more than 4,500 people in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea in West Africa.

"Hollywood is split down the middle over whether Andy Serkis should get an Oscar for his 'motion captured' role in Dawn of the Planet of the Apes . Hollywood is split down the middle over whether British actor Andy Serkis should get an Oscar for his 'motion captured' role in Dawn of the Planet of the Apes. The cinematic star is being tipped as a contender for a golden statuette for his role as Caesar in the summer blockbuster. But Tinsel Town has yet to decide whether Serkis's performance playing a computer-generated ape is acting or a character solely brought to life through computer programmers in an animation studio. The movie proved a smash hit in cinemas internationally and brought in box office profits of $707.4m. The stars of the Apes are currently in Hollywood promoting the DVD release of the movie. Studio 20th Century Fox is promoting its cast for the supporting acting categories in the Academy Awards, and Serkis would be the first actor to win an Oscar for a 'motion capture' role, it emerged. But the potential win for Serkis's performance, which was filmed using 'motion-capture' technology, has sparked a fresh debate in Hollywood over whether it counts as acting or animation. A managing director of UK film and television post-production house Molinare, said the star should be considered for an Oscar because whether he's played an ape or a man, it's all performance. Julie Parmenter said: 'In this case the animal he's portraying comes from his expertise and understanding of the role and that is truly acting. Scroll down for video . Makers of motion capture systems say the performance by Andy Serkis (at front) 'deserves consideration' Dawn of the Planet of the Apes, a summer blockbuster hit, brought in box office profits totalling up to $707.4m . 'It is a powerful role in the film; a costume may have been superimposed on him but it's still him acting.' Phil Elderfield, entertainment product manager at Vicon, which makes motion-capture systems, said Serkis's acting should be counted in as the award season in Hollywood gets into gear. 'We are teetering on the edge of recognition for some performances motion capture has delivered. This is a remarkable piece of work and Andy's performance is deserving of consideration.' But actors themselves are divided over whether the 'motion capture' performance is actually acting. Serkis's co-star Gary Oldman has cast doubt over whether his performance was 'the sort of thing' the Academy will accept because of the heavy use of computer generated imagery. And Jeff Bridges worries that his profession will end up redundant if Hollywood does consider the British man's performance to be acting and therefore entitled to be nominated for awards. 'Actors will kind of be a thing of the past,' he told the LA Times. 'We'll be turned into combinations. A director will be able to say: 'I want 60 per cent Clooney; give me 10 per cent Bridges and throw some Charles Bronson in there'.' Actors' unions have no objection though, and see the possible shift to accepting a performance made part-animation lab, part-acting is a good thing for actors. Martin Brown, assistant general secretary of actors union Equity, said: 'It simply hasn't been a matter for debate in Equity. No one is asking if Andy Serkis is acting or not. 'No concerns have been raised to us. It's new work and actors are moving with it.' Serkis, 50, describes himself as 'evangelical' about the technology and has even set up his own motion-capture company The Imaginarium Studios.","Serkis is tipped as a contender for his role in the summer blockbuster hit .

"A Canadian teacher facing child sex abuse allegations in Indonesia has pleaded with his government to intervene in his case, as he has been held without charge for more than 100 days. Neil Bantleman, 45, was working at the Jakarta International School when he was arrested following claims that several of the children at the institution had been sexually assaulted. Mr Bantleman, who is from Burlington, Ontario, has been held in custody in Indonesia since his arrest on July 14. Canadian teacher Neil Bantleman was arrested in July in Indonesia following child sex abuse allegations . Mr Bantleman, pictured, has been held without charge in Jakarta for more than 100 days since his arrest . He was greeted by his wife Tracy this morning as he appeared at the prosecutor's office in Jakarta . In a letter to the Canadian government, Mr Bantleman said: 'I am writing as a follow up to a letter I sent to you August 14. Since this time, the circumstances of my case have become dire and the time for action on the part of the Canadian government is now.' He added: 'As each day passes and circumstances continue to deteriorate I am pleading for your assistance to intervene and act on my behalf. I have been wrongly accused, taken away from my family and denied my human rights. My resolve is beginning to wane and my hope diminishing. I reach out to you in desperation as only government intervention will save me from a fate which I do not deserve.' Mr Bantleman was taken to the prosecutor's office in southern Jakarta this morning as police handed over a dossier naming him as a suspect. His family insist he is innocent and have called on Canadian authorities to lobby on his behalf. According to his brother, Guy Bantleman, the Indonesian Office of the Attorney General has said Mr Bantleman's case has been sent forward for trial. He told CBC News in Canada his brother will probably be moved to the Cipinang Penitentiary for the pre-trial period which may last a further four months. Mr Bantleman's family claim the 45-year-old teacher is innocent and called on Canadian authorities to help . Mr Bantleman was arrested alongside Indonesian teaching assistant Ferdinand Tjiong, who is also being held without charge. The pair were arrested after an earlier allegation of abuse against cleaners who worked at the school . Following the arrests of Mr Bantleman and Mr Tjiong, the school issued a statement supporting the two men. According to the statement: 'We are distressed by this turn of events and are very frustrated that our staff members have been detained based on allegations against them that are absolutely false and are made without evidence. We will continue to stand by these staff members, both of whom have exemplary professional records. We appeal to the Indonesian Police to reconsider their decision to detain both men.' I am writing as a follow up to a letter I sent to you August 14th. Since this time, the circumstances of my case have become dire and the time for action on the part of the Canadian government is now. The office of the Attorney General announced Wednesday, October 29th that they would be accepting my case for trial after rejecting the file on three previous occasions. No further 'evidence' had been collected and additional requirements never completed, yet the file has been accepted. These developments are highly suspect and cause concerns about corruption and collusion between the prosecutors office and the police to move this case forward abandoning all considerations of proper legal protocol and procedures. It is my understanding that there is a legal precedence whereby the Attorney General's office can still review the file and make a decision to refrain from proceeding to trial. I am asking the Canadian Government to use all its power to take immediate diplomatic action at the highest levels, where political influence is expected to have its greatest effect, to ensure the case does not move forward to trial. This is a critical time as a new government has been sworn in and a new Attorney General is to be appointed within days. The selection of this attorney general is charged with the responsibility of eradicating corruption and eliminating injustice. I have been informed that the founding embassies of JIS, the US Embassy, Australian Embassy and British Embassy, are planning to meet the new Attorney General within days of his/her appointment to lobby for the case to be thrown out. I expect the Canadian Embassy will be present as well. In addition to this lobbying, I am requesting that Ottawa reach out to this newly appointed government at the highest levels to make your concerns known. Although I am relieved to know that status of the US female individual (JIS Elementary Principal) remains that of a witness, it is difficult to accept that she has avoided being named a suspect. It is apparent that she has been afforded greater protection as an American citizen and I feel it is unacceptable that Canada has not made a greater effort to protect and stand up for an innocent Canadian citizen. As each day passes and circumstances continue to deteriorate I am pleading for your assistance to intervene and act on my behalf. I have been wrongly accused, taken away from my family and denied my human rights. My resolve is beginning to wane and my hope diminishing. I reach out to you in desperation as only government intervention will save me from a fate which I do not deserve. Respectfully .

"A UPS delivery driver has landed in hot water after being filmed kicking a 'fragile' package containing $12,000 worth of goods. CCTV footage shows the unidentified employee roughly rolling a large box out of the reception area at East Hills Instruments in Westbury, New York, on Monday afternoon. Ray Martel, who owns the the power plant instrument supply business, said that he was 'shocked' when he watched the surveillance video and saw the driver 'bowl' the parcel - which contained a delicate pressure gauge - around. 'This guy just basically threw the thing out the door . . . If he needed help, he could have just asked,' he told ABC News.

"Imagine turning up to a Tinder date for the first time, only to be asked to have your photo taken as part of an art exhibition. Australian photographer Kirra Cheers used the online dating app, which has a reputation for its 'hook-up' culture, as an opportunity to discover the true meaning behind modern romance. Her exhibition 'Tinderella' - a common byline used by attractive females on Tinder - explores the reactions of 17 dates with the 27-year-old over two months. While Cheers only exposed herself to the online dating scene two years ago - when she first moved to New York and used the app as a tool to meet new people in a foreign city - she's turned her experience to document her honest connection with her confidants. And she founds the results were quite surprising. In most cases, she developed a strong relationship with her subjects while also being asked to 'charm my sack' by a Tinder romantic. Scroll down for video . Kirra Cheers decided to test out Tinder for the first time when she moved to New York about two years ago. She initially used it to meet new people and also explore the new city . The Australian photographer based in New York went on 17 dates, 11 of which allowed her to take photos of them, as part of her project on modern romance . The 27-year-old first used Tinder as a tool to meet people in a foreign city. While the photographer says she's had positive experience on the online dating app, she doesn't believe it would be a place where she'd find 'the one'. 'I initially signed up for Tinder because I was single and I had just moved to another country so it was a chance for me to get out and see the city,' she said. 'I had a good experience although I know a lot of people talk about how it's used as a sex hook up. But I've personally met great people through Tinder - some fabulous men and close friends. 'I think it's a useful tool to make friends and connect with people. But I'm not sure whether it’s the right place to look for a long lasting relationship due to the immediacy of the app. I think people are less willing to put time into a relationship these days.' Once hitting the American dating scene, Cheers - who grew up in Adelaide - also found it was quite different from what she was used to in Australia. 'Online dating in Australia is only just becoming socially acceptable whereas in New York it's the main platform to meet people,' she said. 'Dating is also very formalised here and it's socially accepted to be dating three or four people at a time so I think some women get frustrated with that.' Samuel, a 32-year-old videographer, who met up with Kirra at a fashion launch and then had drinks together at a friend's rooftop . Alex, a 25-year-old who works on finance, who also met up for drinks with Kirra. According to the photographer, she developed a strong connection with many of her subjects . Another subject who met Kirra at a bar - Freddie - who's 27-years old and works in finance. Kirra says she was able to develop a level of trust with her subject who then allowed her to take their picture . Dan who's a 26-year-old and works as an illustrator. Kirra met up with Dan at a bar. He is among the 11 Tinder dates who allowed her to take a photo . This was the inspiration behind her body of work quite aptly named Tinderella - a collection of black and white portraits from 11 of the 17 dates she had in June and July. 'I really wanted to go out with people I genuinely wanted to date and photograph the connection I had with them,' she said. From the experience, she gained 11 follow up dates and developed close friendships. But she also encountered the reality behind Tinder and perhaps what constitutes as 'romance' for some in today's day and age. 'Matt hit me up for sex right away but I think through the conversation - before you meet the person - you're able to tell if the person has an agenda,' Cheers said. 'It really depends on what you're looking for. If it's purely appearance based then I think you'll have an infavourable experience.' Cheers says this also comes to the changing notion of dating which she thinks is now seen as a game. 'Our idea of romance has changed from the traditional mind set we've had in the past,' she said. 'Many people see Tinder as a game and I think that while dating life has gone digital it too has turned into a game.' A man named Matt who asked Kirra to 'charm my sack' during their chat on Tinder. The photographer wasn't impressed with his pick up line . Sophie, 22, who's a translator. She and Kirra enjoyed people watching during their date. Sophie was part of Kirra's New York exhibition in August . Chris, a 27-year-old actor and model. During their date, Kirra and Chris shopped for their imaginary children at a toy shop then went for dinner . Jude, a 31-year-old designer, who had drinks and pizza with Kirra. She says online dating is more socially accepted in America than Australia . Justin, 33, who works in finance and real estate development. He met Kirra for brunch. She says dates in America are 'very formalised' Mike, a 26-year-old who works in finance, went for drinks with Kirra. She says a lot of her Tinder dates turned up to her art exhibition and were proud to be part of it . Andrew, a 32-year-old musician, who took Kirra out for dinner. She was very surprised by the open-mindedness of most of her dates . David, a 24-year-old law student, who had drinks with Kirra at a bar. She hope to further develop her project by interviewing her Tinder dates . Cheers says some subjects made it clear that they were uncomfortable with the idea of having their picture taken - some accusing of being a 'predator' or 'pervert' - but others were surprisingly open-minded. Most even attended her exhibition in August - her first art exhibition in New York. 'I was really nervous because it was so personal and I was opening myself up to people,' she said. 'But I had such an overwhelming response from the 400 people who showed up and even my dates came by and were proud to be part of exhibition.' While she hopes to further develop her project and continue interviewing her subjects, Cheers has decided to take a break from the online dating scene after suffering from what she calls a 'Tinder hangover'. 'It was exhausting. I was totally burnt out emotionally and physically,' she said. As for finding 'the one' - she hasn't quite achieved that through the project but says she is currently dating someone who met through - you guessed it - Tinder.","Australian photographer Kirra Cheers went on dates with people she was attracted to on dating app Tinder and documented her connection with them .

"Two pilots were killed as their planes collided over the Nevada Desert yesterday, sending them crashing them near a dry lake bed. A four-seat, single-engine Cessna 170 and an unidentified aircraft crashed in mid-air at about 8am yesterday morning, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said. There were no other people on board the two planes and no one on the ground was hurt. A single-engine Cessna (file picture) was involved in the mid-air collision with an unidentified aircraft . Both pilots were found dead at the scene, 10 miles north-west of Yerington, Nevada, and are yet to be identified, the Reno Gazette-Journal reported. It is not known why they crashed. Police Sergeant Ryan Powell said: 'Deputies met with witnesses on scene who stated that two airplanes collided north of the dry lake bed and crashed into the side of a hill.' Witnesses described hearing a 'pop', before seeing debris falling from the sky and smoke rising from over a hill. Jack Lyons, who rushed to the scene to try to help, said: 'Everyone was in shock.' Several airplanes were flying in and out of the dry lake bed, which is used as a makeshift runway, over the weekend, the sheriff's office said in its statement. The FAA and the National Transportation Safety Board will investigate, the crash. The pilots' families are yet to be informed.","A Cessna 170 and an unidentified plane crash over the Nevada Desert .

"European breaks in the autumn will be even better value for Britons now as the pound strengthens against the euro. After a dip in the sterling attributed to the uncertainty surrounding the Scottish referendum, the pound has climbed again. With the euro at about 1.28 to the pound, Brits are getting eight per cent more spending power on the Continent than they would have at the same time last year. The pound has bounced back against the euro to deliver better value for Britons on the Continent . British tourists' pound will travel further on visits to destinations such as Paris this autumn . Foreign exchange company Travelex said on Friday that Britons can now get £36 more when exchanging £500 into euros than they would have got 12 months ago. 'We saw consistent growth of the pound in early 2014, which was unsettled this month due to consumers' concerns over the Scottish referendum and what implications it would have on currency,' David Swann of Travelex said. 'It's reassuring to see the pound back on track - no doubt also helped by the Bank of England's moves towards increasing interest rates.'

"A sudden cold snap, after the humid summer, has caused millions of ladybirds to invade homes seeking warmth. Experts had warned of an influx of a foreign species - harlequin ladybirds - which are said to pose a major threat to native 'English' ladybirds. But some homes nationwide have been overwhelmed with ladybirds of all species seeking sanctuary from the cold. Scroll down for video . Home invasion: Pensioner Joan Webley has had over 100 ladybirds invade her home in Gloucester . Joan Webley currently has over 100 ladybirds in her home in Gloucester. Retired cleaner Joan, 70, said: 'There are currently about 110 of them. I hope that this is it as I am running out of room for them now. 'It's a weird situation. My grandson put pictures on the internet and it is amazing how much people seem to know. 'There used to be about 20 or 30 coming in until this year, and now I'm wondering how many more there will be. 'They don't do me any harm. They just come in and wander around for a bit, before huddling up and going to sleep. 'They tend to stay all winter, starting to leave in February but they are all gone by March. Creepers: Clusters of ladybirds can be seen above the door and the windows in Ms Webley's kitchen . Joan Webley looks at the insects and says she 'hadn't seen any all summer and now they have all appeared' 'If it is going to be this cold, I don't think any more will make it to the house, they are probably dying by now. 'The funny thing is, I hadn't seen any all summer in my garden and now they have all appeared.' Ladybird expert Katie Murray, of the University of Stirling, said: 'The cold conditions at this time of year mean ladybirds huddle together in leaf litter or other sheltered places like houses, sheds, garages, or other outbuildings.' Darren Hawkins, from Fishponds, Bristol, is also under siege from the colourful insects. 'They're everywhere. Every time I open a window to try to get some of them out, another load come in. I've never seen anything quite like it.' Professor Adam Hart, and insect biologist at Gloucestershire University, said: 'It's hard for us to know if there are more. However, anecdotally people are noticing a lot more this year. 'The conditions that have proceeded now have been good for them. Ladybirds are predatory. The more insects about the better for them. Baby, it's cold outside: The ladybirds have invaded Ms Webley's home in an attempt to seek warmth . 'This time of the year is when they start heading inside. While the cold is a factor, they are also effected by daylight. 'They come together to keep their moisture together, nestled in a corner, away from the warm parts of the house. 'They are not a hazard or health concern, unless you decide to eat a significant number of them. 'If you don't like them, you can put them back outside. It is early enough in the year that they will find somewhere else.' Harlequin ladybirds, introduced from North America in 1988, are regarded as the most invasive ladybird species on earth. It is larger and more aggressive than its native cousins. A survey group has even been set up to keep track of its spread. Most harlequins are also carriers of the sexually transmitted disease Laboulbeniales fungal disease that can spread to other ladybirds. To track ladybirds, people can log on here. The Harlequin ladybird (left) is putting Britain's native insects (right) in peril and has invaded much of Europe . They are colourful little insects and number about 3,500 species worldwide, with Britain home to some 46 types of the ladybirds. Among them is the herbivorous Bryony ladybird, Epilachna argus, and the small brown ladybird, Rhyzobius chrysomeloides, of which both are recent additions to the flying insect in Britain. The two-spot ladybird (Adalia bipunctata) has up to 16 black or red spots, which can vary in shape – in splodges or in a grid pattern. It is the ladybird which most commonly overwinters in buildings. The pine ladybird (Exochomus qadripustulatus) is round in shape with a pronounced rim around the margin of the wing cases. Another is the 14-spot ladybird (Propylea quatuordecimpunctata) which is yellow or black with between four and 14 black or yellow spots, which are almost rectangular. This fluttering insect spends its winters in various locations, usually close to the ground. But none have attracted the notoriety of the Harlequin ladybird (H. axyridis). Known as the most invasive ladybird on earth, it was introduced to North America in 1988, where it is now the most widespread ladybird species on the continent. It has already made inroads into much of northwestern Europe, and first arrived in Britain in the summer of 2004. The Harlequin has spread rapidly north and west from the southeast of England since its first sighting, spreading to most parts of the UK in just four years. Dr Helen Roy of the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology said: 'The rate of spread is dramatic and unprecedented.'","Experts had warned of an influx of a foreign species of insect into Britain .

Trains from London Bridge to Hayes have been affected and are currently terminating at Elmers End.' A Met Police spokeswoman said: 'We are still working on removing the lorry.' Ian Price, 59, who lives nearby, said: 'I was pulling out of my drive at around 1.30pm and stopped to let the fire engine past.

"It has been three years years since Baby Lisa was snatched from her crib in the middle of the night. But parents Deborah Bradley and Jeremy Irwin still keep their baby daughter's room exactly how it looked the night she disappeared from their suburban home in Kansas City, Missouri. 'Her room is so full of toys you can hardly walk in there,' Deborah told The Kansas City Star. Next month,Deborah and Jeremy will celebrate Lisa's fourth birthday with a cake and presents. 'It just gets harder,' Deborah, who also has two sons, told The Star. 'We try the best we can to function, to care for our boys and wait for her to come home.' Deborah Bradley and Jeremy Irwin hold an age-progressive rendering of what their daughter Lisa might look like years after her abduction in 2011 . Baby Lisa Irwin is admired by her brothers Blake (left) and Michael shortly after her 2010 birth . Despite all the heartache, Deborah and Jeremy remain strong in searching for and hoping that Baby Lisa will return . The mother . tucked her 10-month-old baby into her crib and put her to sleep on Oct. 4., 2011. The father came back home a few hours later to a shocking . discovery — their tiny baby girl was missing. Local . officials — from detectives to search parties on horseback — tracked . down thousands of leads, hunting for Baby Lisa in open fields, vacant . lots, wells and just about anywhere they could go. The . distraught parents had been on national television to plea for help . finding their daughter. One benefactor even offered $100,000 for . information leading to the girl's safe return. But gradually, the tips slowed down to a trickle. Police received 100 tips in the last year. The parents' attorney, John Picerno, said police are still re lacking 'substantial, concrete leads,' according to The Star. But Bradley and Irwin are yet to give up. 'If . you see something, please call the police,' Deborah told The Star. 'Keep your . eyes open. It only takes one sighting to bring her home.' This is one of the few pictures of Baby Lisa from before she was abducted at 10 months old in 2011 . The nursery where Lisa slept is filled with princess dresses and toys as her family waits in agonizing hope for her return . Piles of pink toys and dresses have been collected for Lisa over the years since her disappearance . The parents' nightmare began in the early hours of Oct. 4, 2011. News of Lisa’s abduction exploded into the small north Kansas neighborhood. Officers hammered on neighbors’ doors, an Amber alert went out, posters were swiftly printed and a hotline set up. A handful of sightings went nowhere. The couple became the subject of intense scrutiny. Deborah initially stated she had checked on baby Lisa around 10.40pm. Later she wasn’t so certain that she had checked on the infant who was recovering from a cold and fever, after putting her down earlier than usual close to 6.30pm. An electrician, Jeremy was working a night shift. He came home around 4am to a house in some disarray, several lights were on, the front door was unlocked and with a cold sense of foreboding he checked on Lisa to discover she was gone. In the weeks that followed young mother Deborah was forced to admit to having fallen asleep drunk. A poster and yellow ribbons are displayed on a . neighbor's tree two doors away from the home where Lisa Irwin was . abducted in 2011 . Jeremy and Deborah have decorated their home with pictures of Baby Lisa in the hopes that someone can provide new information on what happened to their child . Posters of Lisa were tacked to the front of the family’s clapboard home. Fading kidnap appeal posters are still strapped to neighbors’ trees with yellow ribbon. A banner on the Irwin’s home reads: ‘This house needs Lisa to make it home again. Help bring Lisa home.’ A little pebble, bearing the word ‘Hope’ sits at the door. Speaking to MailOnline last year, Jeremy said: 'Is it heartbreaking and depressing every single time you see it? Absolutely. But it’s not going anywhere soon until she comes home.' As a couple, Deborah and Jeremy try to maintain as much stability as possible for sons, Blake, 11, and Michael, 7. Blake is Jeremy’s son from a previous relationship and Michael is Deborah’s from her first marriage. Lisa is their only child together. Over the weekend and on holidays Lisa’s older brothers help hand out fliers and buttons and bracelets. Sometimes, Deborah admitted, it is their strength that gives her the will to carry on. She clutches Lisa’s favorite Barney toy in bed each night. ‘You have these moments when you just can’t believe that somebody stole your baby,' she told MailOnline in 2013. Deborah’s one consolation is her belief that whoever took Lisa did not do so with the intention of harming her.

"Days after violent anti-capitalist protests in Brussels and London, the first demonstrations against next week's G20 summit in Brisbane took on a more relaxed atmosphere. About 100 anti-poverty activists turned out dressed as accountants and reclined on beach chairs alongside Brisbane River on Saturday. It comes as security is ramped up in preparation for the summit, with nearly 7000 police and soldiers being flown to the city, and large areas being declared a secure zone. On Saturday, the first protest against the G20 summit in Brisbane took place, with about one hundred activists dressing as accountants on Brisbane river . The activists, part of an anti-poverty group labelled Micah Challenge, dressed as business acountants and drunk cocktails, in a quirky protest against tax-dodging . The Group of Twenty summit, happening next week at the Brisbane Exhibition Centre (pictured) is a meeting between the worlds leading economies . On Thursday, an anti-establishment protest in Brussels turned violent with cars being set ablaze and police  using tear gas to quell the 100,000 strong crowd. About 50 people were hurt and 30 were detained at the initially peaceful demonstration. In London, a separate anti-capitalist protest labelled the 'million man march' took place outside Parliament Square on Wednesday. Violence erupted as thousands of masked protesters blocked off roads and attacked police. Officers were forced to draw their batons as missiles and road signs were launched into the sky, while protesters attacked cars and members of the public with yellow flexible tubes. At one point, there were reports of protesters surrounding a man driving a new Mercedes car and spraying the back of the vehicle with an aerosol can, threatening him with their tubes as he opened his windows.

The initially peaceful rally erupted in violence, with at least 30 protesters detained . Though it was organised with similar motives, the Brisbane demonstration on Saturday was much more placid, with police confirming there were no arrests. The protesters, part of the anti-poverty group Micah Challenge, set up a mock tropical 'tax haven' in the central city to highlight the issue of multinational tax dodging, which they claim robs $160 billion annually from developing countries. Spokeswoman Angela Owen said the demonstration was peaceful and well received. 'A lot of people said they supported our message and others said it was a really creative demonstration,' she said. British police officers scuffle with demonstrators during a protest across from the Houses of Parliament in central London . Police draw their batons as the 'million man march' turns violent . Extreme security measures have been implemented across Brisbane in light of previous G20 protests leading to riots, as well as threats of violent action from local anarchist groups. The Australian Defence Force have been conducting a series of counter-terrorism exercises in Brisbane in preparation for the event. More than 900 soldiers will be based in Brisbane, with a further 1000 on call, as well as an immense police presence . There is now believed to be about 6000 police, including 1500 from interstate and New Zealand, who will patrol the area until  November 17. These officers have been permitted to carry firearms, while international forces have yet to granted permission. Australian Defence Force personnel are seen during a training exercise at the Queensland Fire and Emergency services Academy in Brisbane . ADF soldiers have been conducting a series of counter-terrorism exercises in Brisbane in preparation for the event, with 900 soldiers flying to Brisbane for the summit . Meanwhile, a large swathe of central Brisbane was declared a security zone on Saturday, forming a security buffer around areas like hotels where delegates will stay, as well as the convention centre where the summit will take place. Under the G20 (Safety and Security) Act, police will have the power to search people within the declared zone if they suspect them of having prohibited items, which include include obvious things like firearms, knives and explosives, however, they also include eggs, kites and glass jars, which are prohibited without a lawful excuse for possessing them. Deputy Commissioner Ross Barnett has vowed that residents will only be punished if they break the rules. 'There's got to be a connection between the item and some intent to possibly disrupt the event or hurt some person,' he said. 'The item itself is not strictly the issue. It's the time, date and place that it's used and the intent of the person who has it.' Roads are closed as the surrounding areas are declared a security zone, forming a security buffer around areas like hotels where delegates will stay, as well as the convention centre where the summit will take place . International leaders are also taking immense precautions with the G20 event, with news that Barrack Obama is planning on flying in at the ultra-secure Amberley air-base instead of Brisbane airport. One man, 57, has been banned from the summit after taking photos without permission on the steps of the Brisbane convention centre. He is the fourth person to be banned from the event. At about 11:35, the man was arrested after refusing to give his details, before arguing and struggling with officers. Police also found homemade bombs and bomb-making equipment on Saturday at a residence in Rochedale South, 20 km from Brisbane, reports Courier Mail. Officers arrived at the property at to find a number of explosives at 4pm, however they claim the bombs were not terrorism or G20 related. The G20 is often been met with radical protests from anti-establishment groups.The 2010 Toronto summit protests saw $750,000 worth of damage wreaked on the streets, including scores of vehicles being set ablaze and mass looting of stores.","First protest against the G20 summit in Brisbane took place on Saturday .

"A five-year-old boy tested positive for cocaine after his parents allegedly left him with a half-pound bag of the substance during a drug deal. Marco Cuevas, 31, and his pregnant wife Sandy, 29, were arrested in California when police allegedly caught them selling drugs from their car. After the couple, who have three children, were arrested, their infant son was found in the back seat next to an enormous bag of cocaine. Busted: Marco Cuevas, 31, and his pregnant wife Sandy, 29, were arrested during an alleged drug deal and police officers found their son in the back of the car with a bag of cocaine. He tested positive for the drug . Shockingly, preliminary tests showed the boy had a significant level of cocaine in his system. Mr Cuevas was carrying a further two ounces of cocaine while Mrs Cuevas, who is said to be seven months pregnant, had $10,000 cash on her person when they were arrested on Friday, KTLA reported. A search on the family's home in Sylmar uncovered more drugs and weapons, according to the Ventura County Sheriff's office.

"A Philadelphia-area man who survived a suicide pact that left his mother dead will not face a homicide trial. A Bucks County judge has dropped a homicide charge against 30-year-old Koustantinos 'Gus' Yiambilis in the April death of his 59-year-old mother, Karen. Judge Albert Cepparulo in a ruling Tuesday says he found no evidence of malice on the son's part. Yiambilis is still charged with two felonies, aiding in suicide and risking a catastrophe. He remains in custody on $500,000 bail. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Homicide charge dropped: Judge Albert Cepparulo in a ruling Tuesday dropped a homicide charge against 30-year-old Koustantinos 'Gus' Yiambilis (pictured) in the April death of his 59-year-old mother, Karen . Suicide pact: Both Karen and Gus had medical, emotional, and finical problems when they decided to end their lives on April 7 by carbon monoxide poisoning . Authorities responding to fumes at their Bensalem apartment found the mother dead and the son disoriented from carbon monoxide poisoning. Investigators say the room was taped shut while a gas generator ran. Defence lawyer William Goldman Jr. says justice was served because his client did not kill his mother. 'Gus loved his mom. The most important person in Gus' life was his mom,' Goldman said. 'There was no reason for him to take the life of his mother other than their joint decision that they were going to God together.' Both mother and son left suicide notes. One read, 'The negativity in this world is too much for us to deal with, we are sorry but we wish not to deal with it anymore. We are going home to God.' Philly.com reports that Goldman argues that under the state's criminal code, a person cannot be charged with a criminal homicide or causing someone's suicide unless it was done by 'force or deception.' Court documents quote Deputy District Attorney Alan J. Garabedian as saying that there was enough evidence to bring the case to trial due to the level or carbon monoxide in the home and the fact that Gus told police he refilled the generator when it ran out of gasoline. Goldman told reporters he hoped a plea deal would be reached on October 6. Goldman told reporters that despite not being charged with murder, Yiamblis could still serve time. Assisting in a suicide can warrant a sentence of three to 12 months and risking a catastrophe can cause a sentence of probation to three months. Reckless endangerment against another person is merely a misdemeanor. Goldman said that Yiambilis 'embraces the idea' of counselling as a term of a plea deal. Both the mother and son had medical, emotional and finical problems when they decided to end their lives on April 7. Goldman told reporters that both were unemployed and suffered from health problems. The son suffered from an anxiety disorder and also suffered brain trauma. The mother had fibromyalgia, an autoimmune disorder that causes full body pain. They also had medical debt which may have led to eviction. Left suicide notes: The pair left notes detailing their sadness for living and their desire to end the suffering in their lives such as their medical debt and chronic pain from illness and trauma .","A judge has dropped a homicide charge against 30-year-old Koustantinos 'Gus' Yiambilis in the April death of his 59-year-old mother, Karen .

"When Stephen Colbert did his daily stalk of himself, he discovered an upsetting error - he was too short. Searching the internet for his own height, the political satirist found that Google listed him as being 5ft 10ins, one inch shorter than he is in real life.

'I'm THIS much taller, Google!': Stephen Colbert did some internet stalking of himself and discovered he was listed as 5ft 10in - one inch too short - on Google . Speaking on his show The Colbert Report, the political satirist feigned upset, with a serious undertone. Addressing Mr Page directly, Colbert demanded 'a retraction, an investigation, an apology and a substantial cash settlement.' He joked that he wanted the 5'11 glory he shares with Brad Pitt and Russell Crowe, rather than share 'the stale air' of the (5ft10in) Johnny Depp. 'All I want is the height I deserve. And I fought for every inch, and no one, but no one, is taking that away from me. Especially not Larry Page, who according to Google, is 5'11'.' Jibe: Colbert made a joked about making a 'physical threat' to Google CEO Larry Page . 'Fix it, or I will fix you, Page. And yes, that is a physical threat.' Knowing that a man like Colbert is not a wrath one wishes to invoke, Google quickly took action on the matter - in the best way possible. Now if you google 'How tall is Stephen Colbert?', it results in '5ft 10.5ins (1.79m -ish)'. Colbert's height is also compared to other talkshow hosts - Larry Page (5ft 11ins) and Conan O'Brien (6ft 4ins). However, in another jibe from Google, not-exactly-NBA-material Jon Stewart is simply referred to as 'Shorter'.","Stephen Colbert discovered he was one inch too short on Google .

"A three-year-old girl who lost her right eye and was left with horrific scarring after being mauled by her grandfather’s pitbulls is on the road to recovery thanks to the generosity of three doctors who are working hard to rebuild her face. Victoria Wilcher from Mississippi made national headlines in June after her grandmother claimed they'd been kicked out of KFC because the young girl’s disfigured face had scared customers. The allegations were later disproved, but little Victoria’s tragic story attracted widespread sympathy including from three doctors who have volunteered their time and expertise to help the young girl. Victoria Wilcher from Mississippi made national headlines in June after her grandmother claimed they'd been kicked out of KFC because the young girl’s disfigured face had scared customers . Las Vegas plastic surgeon Dr. Frank Stile, right, has agreed to carry out a series of operations on Victoria over the next five years . A Florida doctor has made Victoria a prosthetic eye, while a local physician has reconstructed the girl’s eyelid and a Las Vegas plastic surgeon has agreed to carry out a series of operations over the next five years. ‘We are extremely optimistic about Victoria's recovery,’ plastic surgeon Dr. Frank Stile told Fox News. ‘We continue to track her progress as her facial bones and scars continue to heal.’ Last month Dr. Raymond Peters, of Naples, Florida, made and installed Victoria’s prosthetic eye. Doctors then noticed the girl’s lower eyelid needed to be corrected in order to support the new eye and so Dr. Kyle Lewis, of Jackson, carried out a skin graft. The toddler will need an estimated 200 surgeries to repair her damaged face. ‘Victoria is going to have to go through at least four to five years of surgery,’ said Peters. Dr. Raymond Peters (left) implanted a prosthesis, right, in Victoria's right eye socket last month . One operation in the near future will make the lid over Victoria’s good eye match the one on which Lewis operated in order to 'produce more symmetry of her facial structure,’ said Stile. Victoria gained national attention in June when her grandmother, Kelly Mullins, said they were forced to leave KFC because the girl’s scarred face was 'disrupting our customers'. Although two different investigations disproved the claims, the fast food chain offered to donate $30,000 to the Wilcher family. Despite sticking to their story, the Wilchers asked KFC to give the money to the foundation of Dr. Stile. More than $100,000 was also donated via GoFundMe.com, but even after the KFC story was exposed only a few donors requested their money returned. Victoria Wilcher, three, nearly died after being mauled and disfigured in a dog attack in April, left, and before the horrific attack, right . The family has pledged that every cent will be spend on getting Victoria better. It has been put in a discretionary trust account which is due to have a third-party, non-family member designated as the trustee. Some of the money will be used to pay Victoria's travel and hospital expenses during her regular trips to Las Vegas for surgeries. Janet Kellum, who is the stepmother of the Wilchers’ family attorney, Bill Kellum, and who has taken on the role of family spokesperson, told Fox News Victoria 'is doing really well.' 'She’s back being active, playful,' Kellum said. 'Back to her little, same-old 3-year-old self.' Victoria had been injured in April when three of her grandfather's pit bull dogs ran into his home in Simpson County by ripping through the back door of the home before jumping on her. Victoria gained national attention in June when her grandmother, Kelly Mullins, left, said they were forced to leave KFC because the girl’s scarred face was 'disrupting our customers' They dragged the little girl outside into the backyard, where they continued to maul her before her grandfather, Donald Mullins, and his girlfriend, Rita Tompkins, attempted to stop the carnage. The dogs then attacked their owners, causing Mullins to shoot them. Two of the dogs were killed. Victoria was rushed to the emergency room. She suffered a shattered top and bottom jaw, broken cheekbones and eye-sockets, a broken nose, lost her right eye, and lost the ability to move the right side of her face. Mullins and Tompkins were arrested on charges of child endangerment and their eight surviving pit bulls were seized by Animal Control officers. They have been charged with child endangerment and the case is expected to go before a grand jury soon.","Victoria Wilcher, 3, was viciously mauled by her grandfather's pitbulls in April and lost her right eye .

"People dressed as evil clowns and roaming through towns in the middle of the night are causing a stir in California's San Joaquin Valley. The latest after-dark sighting came Saturday night, when police in Bakersfield responded about 8 p.m. to a report of a clown holding a firearm, according to The Bakersfield Californian. Officers searched but didn't find anyone. People dressed as clowns are causing a stir in California's San Joaquin Valley. Here, a clown is seen in Wasco, between San Francisco and Los Angeles . What would you do if you were walking down the street and ran into one of these creepy masked men? Some residents in Wasco follow social media to know when the next clown appearance will be so they can find these masked weirdos . Police there say this isn't the first time they've had to deal with dressed-up people clowning around. 'We've had multiple of these clown sightings all over town,' Lt. Jason Matson, of the Bakersfield PD, told The Californian. 'He was gone by the time we arrived.' The San Joaquin Valley has been ground zero for evil clown appearances. In Wasco, some 30 miles away, 1 local residents have reported sightings of clowns since October 1. Props and costumes change routinely, leading some Wasco residents to believe there is a menacing gang of bandits dressing up like the clowns from everyone's nightmares. 'I just seen him about three times already,' Anthony Garza, of Wasco, told KGET. 'But yeah—he's creepy.' Some brave souls have stayed tuned to social media, where locals report any sightings of the clown—— then go out hunting for the devilish creature once he's spotted. 'Some of the residents go in cars searching for him,' Noah Sanchez told KGET. 'They have flashlights and try and spot him in neighborhoods after he posts to Twitter.' Nobody really knows who the clowns are. Some people think it's one person, others say it's several. 'Yesterday they were saying there were two, then they were trying to say like seven, but I don't know,' Kevin Cabello told KGET. A mysterious clown stands near a home in Wasco, California, as the creepy trend spreads . Despite the bizarre clown sightings, local cops say they haven't been involved in any criminal activity . Locals have mixed feelings about the clowns. One child says he was chased down the street with an ax, KGET reports. A deputy with the Kern County Sheriff's Office told the station that there have been reports of crimes committed in the neighborhood by people in clown costumes. But so far, none of the clowns has been actually linked to any crimes. 'We have had no reports of any assaults by a clown nor have we any arrests of any clowns at any time I have been here and I have been here two years,' Sgt. Ian Chandler told KGET. Despite creeping plenty of people out, the stunt strikes some locals — specially those searching for the clowns — as a big Halloween joke. 'It's kinda fun though to get us in the Halloween spirit and all of us in the community,' Sanchez told KGET. Some residents  in Wasco say the clowns are a great joke that is getting the town into the Halloween spirit . Some locals have turned the weird appearances into minor celebrities, chasing reported sightings all around town to take a picture with the clowns . One local Wasco resident, who requested anonymity, told KGET that he dressed up as the clown as part of a a year-long photography project with his wife. He told the station he didn't 'expect to start a trend, and did not mean to cause any harm.' The couple plans on posting more pictures on their social media accounts throughout October. Locals say the many-faced clowns popping up around town are likely the result of copy-cats.","Police in Bakersfield, California, were called to a report of a clown holding a firearm and walking around in the middle of the night .

"Manchester City are down and nearly out in the Champions League after yet another flop in Europe. So bad is City's form that they have the second-worst record of all the league title winners who have made it into the Champions League this season. That means the Premier League champions have a worse record than BATE Borisov, the Belarusian league winners, Ludogorets of Bulgaria, and Slovenian titans Maribor. James Milner (left) reflects on another night of misery in the Champions League for Manchester City . Sergio Aguero and City are facing elimination after crashing to defeat against CSKA Moscow on Wednesday . City's latest Euro misery came in the form of a home defeat by CSKA Moscow, leaving Manuel Pellegrini's side bottom of Group E and needing a miracle to progress into the knockout stages. After four games their record reads: played four, won none, drawn two and lost two, with a total of two points to their name. To highlight City's struggles, Sportsmail has created a table based on the results of all last season's European title winners so far in the Champions League. But this table is inversed, with the worst records sitting top of the league and the best at the bottom. This is not the Champions League - this is the Chump-ions League. Bayern Munich have the best record of all Europe's title winners in the Champions League this season . Even Ludogorets of Bulgaria have a better record in this season's competition than City . Only Apoel Nicosia, here in action against PSG, have a worse record than the Premier League champions . Unsurprisingly German giants Bayern Munich boast the best record, with Pep Guardiola's team having secured four wins from four games in the Champions League this season. But that means they are bottom of the Chump-ions League. City are second, with only Apoel Nicosia above them. The champions of Cyprus have just one point to their name in this season's competition. It should be stressed that City can still qualify for the round of 16 in Europe's elite competition, but they will need to beat both Roma and Bayern Munich in their final two games to do so. So it looks like they might have a better chance of topping the Chump-ions League this season.","Manchester City lost against CSKA Moscow on Wednesday night .

"What we believed as children about the soul and the afterlife shapes what we believe as adults, even if we don't admit it, scientists claim. A study has found that our personal beliefs change very little as we grow up, but what we tell others we believe does. It suggests that such private beliefs are as strong among religious people as and non-religious. Scroll down for video . A new study has found that our implicit beliefs about souls and the afterlife change very little as we grow up, but what our explicit beliefs – what we claim to believe – does. A painting called 'The poem of the soul' by Louis Janmot is pictured . Stephanie Anglin, a doctoral student in psychology at Rutgers University in New Jersey began the study by assuming that people have deeply ingrained beliefs about the soul and the afterlife, and set out to measure them. She asked 348 undergraduate psychology students about their beliefs concerning the soul and afterlife when they were 10 years old and at their present age of just over 18. Ms Anglin found that participants’ beliefs about the soul and the afterlife were close to what they remembered as their childhood beliefs. But those beliefs were often very different from what they openly told people they believed now. Stephanie Anglin looked at how implicit beliefs about the afterlife varied between religious and non-religious people and found no difference between them. ‘That suggests that implicit beliefs are equally strong among religious and non-religious people,’ she said. People across the world, regardless of their religion or culture, believe that humans are immortal, according to research published in January. Scientists think the belief that part of us is eternal emerges early in life and is part of our human nature, rather than something that is imposed on a person by a culture or religion. Researchers from Boston University examined children’s ideas about the time before conception and interviewed 283 children from two very different cultures in Ecuador. The study suggests that we often think the part of us that is eternal is not our ability to reason, but our desires and emotions - so we are what we feel. Deborah Kelemen, an Associate Professor of Psychology at the University said the study 'helps us understand some universal aspects of human cognition and the structure of the mind.’ Most studies into the possibility of an afterlife have found that both children and adults commonly believe that bodily needs such as hunger end when people die and emotions continue in some form, but they do not question where such beliefs come from. In the study, cultural influences had no bearing on whether the children believed in immortality. Children who took part in the study reasoned that their bodies didn't exist before birth and that they didn't have the ability to think or remember. But they also said that their emotions and desires existed before they were born. The human trait to believe in immortality might be a by-product of our highly developed social reasoning as humans tend to see others as the sum of their mental states – and desires and emotions are particularly helpful when predicting behaviour. The idea of the soul surviving outside the body, while non-scientific, is natural and deep-seated, the researchers said. She looked out how implicit beliefs varied between religious and non-religious people and found no difference between them. ‘That suggests that implicit beliefs are equally strong among religious and non-religious people,’ she said. Ms Anglin wasn’t surprised by the findings because she was aware of a 2009 experiment in which researchers asked people to sign a contract selling their souls for $2. ‘Almost nobody signed, even though the researchers told them it wasn't actually a contract and would be shredded right away,’ she explained. This was despite some participant claiming they did not believe in an afterlife. Ms Anglin used a well-known statistical tool called the Implicit Association Test, to gauge subjects' implicit beliefs about the soul and afterlife. Such social psychology tests measure the strength of a person's automatic association between concepts in memory. In Ms Anglin’s test, each subject saw two concept words paired on the top of a computer screen, so that ‘soul’ was paired with either ‘real’ or ‘fake’ to gauge their beliefs about the soul. The word ‘soul’ was paired either with ‘eternal’ or ‘death’ to address beliefs about the afterlife. A series of words then flashed on the screen, and the subjects indicated matched them with the two words at the top. ‘For example, if you had “soul” and “fake” on your screen, words like “false” or “artificial” would fit into that category, but words like “existing” or “true” would not,’ she explained. Ms Anglin concedes that her study is not conclusive because she did not study the relationship of participants’ beliefs with their views about social or political issues, for example. She also had to rely on her subjects' memories of what they believed when they were children. ‘It would be really useful to have a longitudinal study examining the same ideas,’ Ms Anglin said. ‘That is, study a group of people over time, from childhood through adulthood, and examine their beliefs about the soul and afterlife as they develop.’ The study was published in the British Journal of Social Psychology.","Scientist at Rutgers University, New Jersey, claims people's private beliefs about  the afterlife are as strong whether they are religious or not .

"An Australian man is recovering in a Thai hospital after being mauled by a young male tiger in a special tourist enclosure at an animal park on the resort island of Phuket. Paul Goudie, from Werribee, near Melbourne, was attacked at the enclosure this week at the 'Tiger Kingdom' tourist show after being given controlled access to a group of young tigers. Mr Goudie, 49, suffered serious bites to his left leg and stomach and is being treated at a Phuket hospital prior to surgery to avoid the risk of infection. Paul Goudie, from Werribee, was mauled by a tiger in a Phuket animal park and retaliated by punching it. He is pictured with his son Jake, 16 . At the tiger park, tourists are invited into a special caged enclosure with handlers as part of the visitor experience. 'We did everything as the park people advised,' Mr Goudie told reporters from the online news service Phuketwan at the hospital. 'I am not sure why it bit me,' he said. The Australian punched the tiger as it attacked him. 'When it did (attack) I had no choice except to whack it in the face a couple of times,' he said. Animal activist group PETA said this attack was just the latest in a long list of such incidents around the world. 'Tiger Kingdom – which has long been the subject of intense scrutiny for its treatment of the animals imprisoned within its walls – gives people the warped idea that these animals are little more than cuddly kitties who can be used and abused for our entertainment,' PETA said in a statement. 'Attacks by captive big cats on people – which occur with staggering regularity – illustrate the profound level of stress, anxiety and agitation these animals experience every day of their lives. The 49-year-old suffered serious bites to his left leg and stomach . 'PETA hopes that this incident will help educate more tourists about the plight of tigers and other animals used for ""entertainment"" and make them think twice before visiting shows and facilities that use exotic animals.' Thai authorities say Mr Goudie, who has two steel pins in an ankle, may have moved awkwardly as park handlers assisted him back to his feet, with the unusual movement triggering an attack. The tiger was tasered by park staff, forcing it to retreat. A visiting medical doctor at the scene provided assistance until a Thai ambulance and emergency staff arrived. 'The handler was with us the whole time. The tiger was 15 months old. I was patting him, everything was fine. I just stood up to leave,' Mr Goudie said. Mr Goudie is on a two-week holiday in Phuket with his family. His son, 16-year old Jake Goudie, said the injuries were largely to his father's left leg and stomach. 'The tiger couldn't get a good grip on my dad's stomach,' Jake said. Thai officials said the tiger park was to be closed for two days while investigations into the accident were conducted. The young tiger is to be 'retired' from contact with visitors. Mr Goudie, who has a tattoo of a tiger, praised the park's staff and said he was even considering another tiger tattoo. 'I don't want anything to happen to the tiger,' he said. 'I don't want it killed.'","Paul Goudie, from Werribee, was mauled by a tiger in a Phuket animal park .

"A Northern Territory man has invented his own unique weather-inspired twist on the hipster beard trend and it’s going down a storm in the Top End. And that's not where his grooming talents end - he's also invented the blowtorch haircut. 'It works well... Your hair is generally shorter than it was before you had the haircut,' Glenn Watt told the Northern Territory News. The Victorian-born fisherman has been naming and modelling his facial hair on Darwin's seasonal weather patterns, including The Cyclone and The Sou'easter stemming from the dry season’s south easterly winds, for a while and it's starting to catch on. Fisherman Glenn Watt created this cloud design in his beard as a nod to the NT's stormy wet season . The most striking of all his designs is The Build Up. In a nod to the Territory's unpredictable wet season, he gave his beard a cloudy makeover. On the ABC’s Tales From The Tinny Facebook page, Mr Watt wrote in response to the comments he received about his beard: ‘Thanks for the support everyone. ‘Sometimes you make sacrifices for art. The dog wouldn't come, the baby cried and the missus packed a bag for me till it was gone. Mr Watt has also invented the blowtorch haircut - something you should not try at home . ‘It's going to be a long hard road for asymmetrical man maintenance enthusiasts but I'm strong. Thanks Rob, Tim and Fadge for encouraging the arts, weather and fishing to come together. The ball is in your court now Dave Krantz.' Mr Watt’s friend Dave Krantz became a fan of his pal’s unusual facial topiary after spotting it on social media and went on to give himself his very own cyclone inspired beard in 2013. In an interview with the ABC, Mr Krantz said: ‘His first one was admittedly not great. So I showed him how it was done.’ Mr Watt’s friend Dave Krantz became a fan of his pal’s unusual facial topiary and tried his own version of the cyclone . Next came some cattle inspired designs: Introducing the 'cattle grid' beard . The mates are now trying to outdo each with their designs and admit the competition has been heating up. Mr Krantz has even gone so far as to branch out from weather inspired designs, turning his skilled hand to creative creations straight out of the ranch. He developed a three-pronged masterpiece, a nod to the cattle grid. Mr Krantz's son does not have a beard... but he does have a lizard Mohawk . The father thought his standard beard (left) could do with some sprucing up (right) To create your own beard etchings you will need 10 days of growth – unless you are particularly hairy – plus a steady hand. Meanwhile, The Bushman’s Haircut, which is in actual fact not a cut at all but involves setting the hair on fire to create a ‘freestyle’ do’ with the help of a blowtorch, is something you should definitely not try at home. Mr Watt told the Northern Territory News he uses a can of insect repellent and a lighter to rid the head of hair. The men are changing the image of fishermen in the Northern Territory, one purple shell suit at a time .","Fisherman Glen Watt models his beard on the Northern Territory's weather .

"The murder of aid worker Alan Henning backfired for ISIS as it 'shifted Muslim opinion' against the militant group, according to an anti-radicalisation expert. Home Office specialist Sulaimaan Samuel says the orchestrated killing of the Salford taxi driver led the vast majority of Muslims to realise the group were beyond the pale. The 47-year-old was beheaded by Islamic State (ISIS) militants in a video released on social media after he was captured in December while delivering food and supplies to Syrian refugees. Salford taxi driver Alan Henning went to Syria to help refugees forced to leave their homes by civil war, but he was captured by ISIS extremists and beheaded in a video broadcast by the group . But a Home Office expert says his killing - at the hands of ISIS executioner 'Jihadi John' - has shifted Muslim opinion against the group and could deter young British Muslims from travelling to the region to fight . Mr Samuel is a national safeguarding mentor for Channel, the Home Office's scheme to prevent adults and children becoming involved in terrorism. He said Mr Henning's brutal killing shocked Muslims around the world and will deter many from going to the region to fight alongside the group. Mr Samuel told Sky News: 'The announcement that they were going to execute him, kill him - this really did shift public opinion and it shifted Muslim opinion wholesale. 'I would personally say to Alan Henning's family: do not think his death has been some type of waste because it hasn't, because his death at the hands of IS is the very thing that has caused the Muslim community to realise that what IS stands for is wrong and can never be condoned. 'In Alan's death he has managed to save thousands of lives now and in the future of people who might potentially have been drawn into going out. 'He will be saving lives in the future. What IS has done has backfired.' Home Office expert Sulaimaan Samuel urged Mr Henning's family not to think his death has been in vain . Mr Samuel said the killing could, in the longer term, help to save 'many thousands of lives' Mr Samuel added that the greatest threat from radicalisation now came from online content, and those travelling to a foreign country or being influenced by a single preacher happened 'much more rarely'. Fellow Briton David Haines was also executed by ISIS militants, following the murders of US journalists Steven Sotloff and James Foley, while another Briton, journalist John Cantlie, remains in the hands of the terrorist group. The group appear to have changed strategy since the release of the series of beheading videos, with more recent films showing Mr Cantlie apparently reading a prepared script of the group's propaganda. He was most recently seen last month in news broadcast-style footage in which the militants used him to air their claims that they hold much of battle-ravaged city of Kobane. Mr Cantlie is a photojournalist who was captured last year while working in Syria. His sister Jessica Cantlie has made an emotional appeal for her brother's return, pleading with the terrorists to reopen lines of contact to secure his safe journey home.","Alan Henning killed after travelling to Syria to give aid to refugees .

"New York Giants' cornerback Prince Amukamara is enjoying his best season yet - and defensive back Antrel Rolle thinks he knows why. Rolle told NJ.com that it's no coincidence that Amukamara, a devout Catholic who previously said he would abstain from sex until marriage, is playing so well just months after getting hitched. 'He's married, so he's (enjoying some things that he wasn't experiencing before he's married),' he said. 'For a man, that could definitely help him out... He walks around with a little more swagger, which is something that we need, which is something that we love.' Scroll down for video . Wedded bliss: Prince Amukamara, a devout Christian who said he wanted to abstain from sex until marriage, wed wife Pilar earlier this year and since, he has been playing better than ever . Whatever the cause, it's paying off. In  four games, Amukamara, who was picked in the first round of the 2011 draft, has already set a career high with two interceptions, as well as 25 tackles. 'When he goes out there playing, you definitely see him being more aggressive, capitalizing on his opportunities and he's accepting challenges. He's winning those challenges,' Rolle said. His coaches said that the 25-year-old has shown steady improvement in his four-year career. 'Prince is a young man who's improved year in and year out,' coach Tom Coughlin said last week. 'And he's improved this past year to this point.' He would not say outright that having sex was responsible for his latest boost. Success: Amukamara breaks up a pass against Andre Johnson of the Houston Texans on September 21 . New man: The couple, who met three years ago, married in Phoenix, Arizona a week after the Super Bowl . Together: They met    at a Manhattan nightclub and he initially did not tell Pilar that he was a footballer player . 'He's just developing more as a man and accepting challenges and being the dominant player that we need him to be that we know he's capable of,' Coughlin said. Amukamara, who hails from Nigeria, has always been open about waiting for marriage before having sex. He also does not drink alcohol. In an interview with Muscle & Fitness last year, he revealed that his clean lifestyle led some of his teammates to call him 'the black Tim Tebow' after his fellow Christian NFL player. He met his now-wife Pilar in a Manhattan nightclub three years ago. In the interview, he said that even though his friends were encouraging him to talk to her, he wasn't sure what to say. Later on, she walked past and he stated talking with her. 'I asked her for her e-mail address because when someone asks for your number, it might be too personal and you might not want to give it,' he said. 'But if you ask for their e-mail address, they'll give it. I was right.' Beautiful: Amukamara, who hails from Nigeria, said he was immediately drawn to Pilar when he saw her . Happy: The couple, seen at the Spider Man premiere, married in Phoenix, Arizona a week after the Super Bowl . But he admitted that he initially hid his job from her. He told the magazine that he has pretended to be a construction worker or a manager at Gap when meeting people in the past - and one teammate has even claimed to be an astronaut. He added that he realized he had to tell Davis the truth when the Giants went to San Francisco for the conference championship. He knew he would have to come clean if he wanted her to visit him. 'So two days later, I said ""Hey, I play for the Giants"",' he recalled. 'She thought I meant San Francisco Giants. That's when I thought she might be a keeper.' He proposed to her on stage at a Jabbawockeez show at Luxor Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas on July 19 last year and they married in Phoenix, Arizona in February. See below for video .

"A woman and her fiancé put alcohol in her disabled 13-year-old son's IV tube, killing him, police have said. Melissa Robitille and Walter Richters III were charged on Tuesday with second-degree murder for the death of Isaac Robitille, who passed away on August 22 in their Hardwick, Vermont home. Melissa Robitille called police at 9am that day to report that she had found the boy, who was born with a brain abnormality and needed around-the-clock care, unresponsive in his bed. His brain abnormality was listed as the cause of death by the Vermont Medical Examiner, while alcohol was listed as a 'contributing' factor. His death was ruled a homicide. Arrests: Melissa Robitille, left, and Walter Richters III, both 38, allegedly put alcohol in her disabled son's IV tube, killing him last month. They were charged on Tuesday, after the autopsy was completed . Loss: Isaac, who was born with a brain abnormality, is pictured with Richters. He passed away on August 22 . An autopsy found his blood alcohol content was 0.146 percent, about twice the legal limit for driving. Investigators believe that Robitille and Richters used an IV tube to administer alcohol to the boy, leading to his death. State police waited to charge the couple until after the autopsy and toxicology reports were complete. The couple, both 38, were arrested and charged on October 7. They are being held at the Northeast Correctional Complex in St. Johnsbury, according to the Corrections Department. Vermont State Police said the couple were in custody but had not been processed in the court system as of Tuesday evening. Robitille detailed her son's medical condition on her blog. Death: Robitille, who has four older children, shared the news of her son's death on Facebook and Twitter on August 22. Authorities said she found his body in bed at 9am and called 911 . Accused: Robitille told authorities she hadn't wanted an autopsy on her son, her fiance said. The medical examiner found that the boy had a blood alcohol level twice the legal driving limit in the state . Couple: Richters, left, wrote on Facebook that he and Robitille were angry about the police's response . 'He has holoprosencephaly - an anomaly in which the fetal horseshoe-shaped brain doesn't fully divide into two hemispheres,' she explained. 'The doctors said he wouldn't live to be six months old. 'He's got a bunch of other differences, but he's a delightfully happy little boy, loves math, hugs, kisses, and his dog (her name is Tickle – he named her!), and hates physical therapy. 'He speaks mostly tactile [American Sign Language]... I adore him.' Isaac was given his dog, Tickle, by the Make-A-Wish Foundation in 2005 and his mother said at the time that she was looking forward to seeing how the animal helped him, WCAX reported. 'Isaac's going to meet so many therapy goals just chasing Tickle around and reaching out,' she said. 'He needs to learn how to reach out and feel the world - because he's afraid of things that could hurt him, because he can't see them. Later on, Tickle will learn to be an assistance dog.' Richters also posted fond messages and pictures about the boy on Facebook and defended himself while lambasting the police response. On a blog, his mother called Isaac a 'delightfully happy little boy, loves math, hugs, kisses, and his dog' On Monday, a day before his arrest, he wrote: 'The police now want to ask us more questions tomorrow. The boy was well taken care of and loved. His time was his time. This is injustice and a bag of rock salt in this families wounds [sic].' Five days after the boy's death, he also claimed on Facebook that an autopsy had been performed on the child's body, even though Robitille told authorities she hadn't wanted 'her baby desecrated if it could be helped'. 'We have nothing to fear but everything to be angry about,' he wrote. 'We aren't criminals.' The couple became engaged in June, according to Richters' Facebook. Robitille was previously married to a man nearly 30 years her senior and has four older children. Robitille works for gaming company Intralot and has previously published two 'paranormal romance novels', according to online profiles.","Melissa Robitille and Walter Richters III, both 38, have been charged with second-degree murder for the death of her son Isaac in August .

"Meet the adorable twin sisters who are stealing tourists' hearts at San Diego Zoo Safari Park. At barely a month old, the pair of cheetah cubs are being hand-raised by staff and receiving around-the-clock care with regular bottle feedings. Thousands of people have fallen in love with the tiny cubs after the zoo released an 80-second video that shows them wrestling in their enclosure, excitedly drinking milk from a bottle and struggling to walk at such a young age. Pile on: The cheetah cubs were born at San Diego Zoo Safari Park in early September . So cute: The adorable animals are being hand-raised by staff and receiving around-the-clock care . Weighing just three pounds each, the curious cheetahs playfully bite each other and make tiny squeaking noises as visitors look on. Because their mother, Allie, has been unsuccessful in raising her previous litters, staff decided to hand rear them at the park’s cheetah breeding facility. While they’re adorable now, the cubs will eventually move on to a carnivore diet and grow into big cats with a weight of up to 140 pounds and incredible speed. The cheetah is the fastest land mammal on the planet with a speed of around 60 mph. Dinner time: One of the cheetahs excitedly sips from a bottle in front of visitors . Play time: Staff decided to hand rear the cubs because their mother has been unsuccessful in raising litters . Zoo staff say the cubs are becoming increasingly active now that their eyes are open and their vision is becoming clearer, and they are full of personality. Eileen Neff, lead keeper at San Diego Zoo Safari Park, said: ‘Every baby's different, but these cheetahs really seem to be developing quickly in our eyes. ‘They are great eaters, they started playing when they were just three or four days old. They could barely walk at that time, so it was pretty interesting seeing them tumbling around with each other.’ Fast friends: The cubs will eventually be paired with a domestic dog for companionship . Zoo staff say the cubs are becoming increasingly active now that their eyes are open and their vision is clearer . But the cute factor doesn’t end here. Without their mother to learn from, the cubs will eventually be paired with a domestic dog for companionship. The dog's body language instructs the cheetah that there's nothing to fear in new or public surroundings, which relaxes and calms the young animal.","Month-old cubs are being hand-raised by staff at San Diego Zoo Safari Park .

"Filmmaker Michael Moore has sparked controversy after calling for photographs of the slain children of Sandy Hook to be made public. The Bowling for Columbine director took to his blog on Wednesday to argue that gory photographs of the crime scene and the bodies of Adam Lanza's 26 shooting victims should be released to force Americans to act on gun control. Under an item entitled 'America, You Must Not Look Away (How to Finish Off the NRA)' outspoken Moore says that similar horrific images forced changes in public opinion on issues like civil rights and Vietnam. Controversy: Michael Moore has called for pictures of the scenes at Sandy Hook - including images of the bodies of the child victims - to be released. The filmmaker says they would make America act on gun control . Opposition: Many criticized Moore's stance today saying it would be an 'offense' to victims and their families to do such a thing . He said a similar route should be taken on gun control. 'I believe someone in Newtown, Connecticut – a grieving parent, an upset law enforcement officer, a citizen who has seen enough of this carnage in our country – somebody, someday soon, is going to leak the crime scene photos of the Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre,' he writes. 'And when the American people see what bullets from an assault rifle fired at close range do to a little child's body, that's the day the jig will be up for the NRA.' 'It will be the day the debate on gun control will come to an end. There will be nothing left to argue over. It will just be over. And every sane American will demand action.' Denial: The documentary maker says America is in denial about the need to act and such images would give them the jolt they need to do something and 'end the NRA' He adds that he expects there will be an outcry from many that publishing the images is 'sick' and a 'disgrace'. But he goes on: 'This will be a false outrage. Because the real truth is this: We do not want to be confronted with what the actual results of a violent society looks like.' 'Because if we were to seriously look at the 20 slaughtered children – I mean really look at them, with their bodies blown apart, many of them so unrecognizable the only way their parents could identify them was by the clothes they were wearing – what would be our excuse not to act? Now. Right now. This very instant!' However among those who were opposed to such a stance were families of the victims who spoke to Fox News yesterday. Jeremy Richman, whose 6-year-old daughter Avielle, was killed in the attack said: 'I would be very strongly against that.' Trying to recover: Children from Sandy Hook Elementary are pictured here returning to school. A victim support worker said Moore's suggestion would ruin the memories of the young victims . Another mother told the broadcaster: 'You can imagine what my reaction to that is'. Co-president of the Newtown Parent Connection, Dorrie Carolan, added: 'It’s going to be a long healing process and to dredge up pictures of the crime scene would not be a good thing. 'We want to remember the little angels as they were, with their happy expressions and faces and you want to think of the teachers trying to hold them safe and not to see the pictures of their bodies. 'For the families and the community, we just want to get back to a normal life and that would be a horrendous offense to the families. There’s no need for any of that.' However, Moore says one mother may understand where he is coming from. Veronique Pozner, mother of 6-year-old victim Noah, took Connecticut Governor Daniel Malloy by the hand to see her young son's open-casket. Remembrance: Many victims families want to remember them as they lived rather than as they died . She later said his death had to be seen. 'I owed it to him as his mother — the good, the bad, the ugly,' Pozner told the Stamford Advocate. 'It is not up to me to say I am only going to look at you and deal with you when you are alive, that I am going to block out the reality of what you look like when you are dead.' 'And as a little boy, you have to go in the ground. If I am going to shut my eyes to that I am not his mother. I had to bear it. I had to do it.' Moore signs off with a warning to the NRA that if Sandy Hook photos aren't released, another victim's family could release gun crime photos in the future and that would spell their end. 'While you're looking at the heinous photographs, try saying those words out loud: 'I support the Second Amendment!' Something, I'm guessing, won't feel right,' he writes . 'Yes, someday a Sandy Hook mother – or a Columbine mother, or an Aurora mother, or a mother from massacres yet to come – will say, like the mother of Emmett Till, ""I just want the world to see."" And then nothing about guns in this country will ever be the same again.'","Controversial filmmaker says releasing crime scene images would help the fight for gun control .
Claims seeing 'what bullets from an assault rifle fired at close range do to a little child's body' is what America needs to act against the second amendment .
Sandy Hook families have hit out at the suggestion and supporters said it would be a 'horrendous offense' if such images leaked ."
"A 15-year-old girl dragged another teenage by the hair and then bashed her and viciously kicked her in the face in an attack in a park which has been captured on video. The attack happened in daylight last Saturday in a suburban park in Cranebrook, which is 60km west of Sydney's central business district. During the alleged attack, the girl, dressed in jeans and a top, attacks the 16-year-old girl among a stand of gum trees in the park near Penrith, in far western Sydney, Ray Hadley reports in an interview and an exclusive video to Radio 2GB.

"Parents will now have to pay up to $90 for their child to fly alone on a Qantas flight. The increase in young kids flying without a parent has risen, prompting the Australian airline to charge a fee. Children aged five to 11 who are travelling domestically without an adult will cost parents $50 in travelling fees, while international flights will see parents paying $90 for their children to travel alone. Kids travelling alone for longer than  six hours have to be at least six-years-old. Parents will now have to pay up to $90 for their child to fly unaccompanied on a Qantas flight . The Qantas fees will commence November 3 but will not exist for unaccompanied children aged 12 to 15 . The fees will commence November 3 but will not exist for unaccompanied children aged 12 to 15, Traveller reports. The new charges for children travelling without an adult will  double if payment is not made before arriving at the airport - $100 for domestic and $180 for international. If your child is travelling to multiple destinations unaccompanied make sure each flight has been made on one booking, as travel agents are told the fee is only for each booking, not for each flight. 'Qantas recognises the importance of providing children travelling alone with the highest levels of comfort and support,' a spokeswoman said. 'Given the increasing demand for this extra support, and the increasing costs involved, we cannot continue to provide this service completely free of charge. This change brings Qantas in line with many of its domestic and international competitors.' Children aged five to 11 who are travelling domestically without an adult will cost parents $50 in travelling fees, while international flights will see parents paying $90 for their children to travel alone . Children who are travelling alone on a Qantas flight are offered 'additional administration at airports, immigration and security processing for international flights, onboard assistance and a ground staff escort at the airport', writes the Traveller. Lay-over rooms are also provided at some airports for young people waiting to board a flight. 'The introduction of an Unaccompanied Minor Supervision Fee will assist in recovering some of the additional costs of the extra services and facilities provided for the comfort and safety of children travelling without a parent or guardian,' the Qantas spokeswoman said. Compared to other airlines, Qantas does not have a restriction against the number of children who are allowed to travel on a flight alone. These charges have already been put in place by Virgin Australia, who charge parents  $40 per flight on domestic and $60 per flight on international for children aged 5 to 11 travelling alone. Children who travel without an adult are seated closer to cabin crew, according to Virgin's website. Airline companies have coped slack for their strategy for not sitting men next to children travelling alone.

"The Australian mum whose 'miracle' baby survived a premature birth in the back of a Fijian taxi - only to lose her husband a month later - has vowed to give back to the hospital which helped deliver her daughter. Jayne Wren, 40, and her husband, Ashley, 41, from Port Macquarie on the NSW mid-north coast, unexpectedly welcomed their daughter while they were holidaying in Nadi for a friend's wedding. An online campaign was launched to help them cover the $60,000 the birth coast as their travel insurance did not cover the expenses of having a baby in Fiji or bringing the child home. But the family's joy at bringing home a happy and healthy girl called Maddi, has now turned to despair with the death of Ashley, a teacher dubbed 'Ironman', from a suspected heart attack on Friday morning. Now, Jayne is determined to honour her husband's memory by donated much needed equipment and essentials to the Fijian hospital that cared for her and her daughter. Scroll down for video . Ashley and Jayne Wren finally returned to back to their Port Macquarie home, north coast of NSW, on June 19 . New dad Ashley, 4, died on Friday after returning home on June 19. Pictured with his first child Maddi . The happy couple celebrated Ashley's 41st birthday in April. Jayne described him as 'the love of my life' The couple are from Port Macquarie, on the NSW mid-north coast . 'It’s Ashley’s legacy to give back to them,' Jayne told 9News.'One day, I’d love to take her back and show the nurses and doctors how she’s thrived.'Jayne began fund raising efforts last month and with the help of Melbourne organisation FijiOz has already shipped 25 cartons of donated items, including toys, blankets and clothes to Nadi Hospital.FijiOz also donated 20 hydraulic hospital beds to the hospital on behalf of the Wrens.Family and friends took to social media to pay tribute to an 'inspirational man' who was much-loved by his community. 'The tears flow and words escape us in disbelief,' one friend wrote. 'Wish I could turn back time for you,' another posted on the mother's Facebook page. Jayne and Ashley Wren weren't expecting to be parents until July, so they did not purchase travel insurance that covered the cost of their baby being born while they were overseas for a friend's wedding last month. Funds continue to be donated for the family and has reached more than $26,000 on mycause.com.au with some leaving condolence messages. They include: 'a smile that is endless... You are missed Ash' and 'Mr Wren was my year 2 teacher. I think about him every time I say, ""Cool bananas""'. Ashley, who taught a year 1 class at St Columba Anglican School, been described as 'a lovely man' and 'one of the funny teachers'. Principal Terry Muldoon said the teacher was a triathlete and successfully completed in the Port Macquarie Ironman challenge. One friend was shocked and wrote that Ashley tragically died from a heart attack. 'You just don't expect an Ironman to die like that,' she wrote. Jayne described her husband as 'the love of my life' in a caption on a Facebook photo. Jayne (right) was 33 weeks pregnant when she went into labour in the back of a taxi in Fiji . The couple had traveled to Fiji so Ashley (right) could be a groomsman at his friend's wedding in Nadi . The couple, pictured with Maddi, did not take out travel insurance covering the cost of their baby being born early . When she spoke to Daily Mail Australia earlier this month, she described the 'horrendous' moment she began giving birth in the back of a taxi on the streets of Nadi. 'I was so fearful that our baby would die,' she said from Fiji at the time, where she is stranded until they can afford to bring their newborn home - and their baby is strong enough to travel. 'The experience of giving birth in the back of a taxi was horrendous to say the least... This being my first baby, being in a foreign country and not knowing that the labor was progressing so quickly,' Mrs Wren explained. Recounting the terrifying moment she went into labour early, she said: 'By the time we reached the front of Nadi Hospital, her head was out and I managed to get from the back seat of the taxi to a stretcher bed, where I gave birth on all fours to my baby girl. 'She literally fell out under my dress on to the mattress of the bed... My husband had to try and catch her... It all happened so fast.' Mrs Wren tried her hardest not to give into contractions but it was no use. 'Everything inside my head in the back of that cab said ""don't push""... but when you are in labor, your body just takes over and it just knows what to do.' Maddison Jayne Cazna Wren arrived early at 33 weeks at 1.7kg and was placed on an incubator at Nadi Hospital. 'The difficulties we are facing at the moment are that she is too small to fly weighing in today at just 1.65kg,' Jayne said. 'She is under the blue ray lights in the incubator at the moment being treated for jaundice, and we will hopefully be able to turn those blue lights off tomorrow or Tuesday. 'Then she has to have the temperature in the humidicrib turned down bit by bit to see if she can tolerate the outside air temperature by herself. This will take another few days. The great news is that she can breath by herself.' A Facebook post on June 26 revealed that the baby was doing well and weighs at 1.98kg. 'Maddison is going from strength to strength,' Jayne wrote. Maddison Jayne Cazna Wren (pictured in an incubator in Nadi Hospital) was born at 33 weeks at 1.7kg. She came home on June 19 . The couple had flown to Fiji last month after being granted full permission by doctors in Sydney. They are grateful for the support they received from staff at Nadi Hospital. 'The treatment for our beautiful daughter at Nadi Hospital has been so amazing,' Jayne said. 'We are lucky enough to have been blessed with an Australian/Fijian doctor by the name of Sai Misi Misi. He is extremely knowledgeable being a pediatrician and has had a lot of experience with premature babies having worked in Australia for a number of years. 'The nursing staff have been so wonderfully loving and caring, and they are totally mesmerised by having a white baby in their care, which is something they don't get to experience very often.' An online campaign was launched to pay the $60,000 to bring Maddi home . The family waited not only to raise enough money to bring Maddi home but also for her to be strong enough to fly. 'To bring Maddi home we need her to be well enough to fly in an open bassinette (which is Doctor Sai's preference over bringing the humidicrib on the plane with us) and to be able to cope with the cabin pressure of the plane.' Mrs Wren's friend Angela Allison is the person in charge of setting up the fundraising page with a target of $60,000. The amount is believed to be needed to cover Maddi's medical bills and travel costs, plus the extra accommodation and flights for the medic to travel with them. Ms Allison told Daily Mail Australia the new parents have been overwhelmed by support from friends, family and strangers. 'Now that a few Aussie celebs have retweeted we are gaining donations from strangers,' she said. 'Initially it was just friends and family of Ash and Jay and people who read about it via the shared Facebook link. It's so exciting to watch the amount raise and to think about how much this is going to mean for them.' To donate, click here. Medical expenses, accommodation and flights for the baby won't be covered by travel insurance.

Sully the Saint Bernard loves his dad so much that he can't help but give him a massive cuddle . Sully presses his massive head down on the man’s face and shifts to take full advantage of his cuddle time. Panting heavily, the dog refuses to budge and leans in even closer to his beloved owner. Sully makes himself more comfortable and even puts his big paws on the man’s chest as he leverages his massive weight, spreading it out more evenly on the bed. The man’s partner, who is filming the video, can he heard giggling gleefully as the owner pleads and begs for the dog to let him go… but to no avail. Instead of obeying his owner, the dog sees the entreaties as even more reason to press his weight down on the man. He then starts furiously licking his owner’s face, who by now can barely contain his giggles.

"Avoid giving cancer patients chocolates and sweets - there are so many other wonderful presents . In the second part of her no-nonsense guide to thriving with cancer, Lucy O’Donnell explains how to cope with chemotherapy – and why sweet treats are the last thing you should give a patient... What gift do you give a woman with cancer? While a well-thought-out present will be hugely appreciated, there are plenty of things to avoid, too. Once, while I was in hospital, a friend brought me cupcakes. They were beautiful little things, and I just couldn’t restrain myself. But even before my diagnosis with stage four, incurable breast cancer in 2011, I tried to stick to a diet free from processed foods and sugar. Other friends gave me pyjamas, bed socks, a beautiful soft poncho, organic body creams, bath oils and lavender eyes masks. There are so many wonderful, helpful things out there, so you don’t need to give chocolates, sweets or champagne. FUEL FOR THE FIGHT . I believe that during cancer treatment, when your immune system is being battered by the disease and the toxic drugs used to kill it, it’s even more important not to consume things that have been altered with synthetic chemicals and preservatives. And that includes sugar-laden ‘treats’. And although I never stopped exercising, when you’re fatigued during chemo and radiotherapy, you simply can’t do it with as much vigour. I was often limited to some gentle stretching in my room, but anything is better than nothing. The aim is to keep your circulation going as this helps recovery. Going back to those cupcakes, I enjoyed every moment of eating them. You do have to allow yourself to break the rules occasionally. I live by the 80/20 rule: if you get it rigorously right most of the time, eating only fresh, unprocessed food and produce – vegetables, fish, poultry, just a little red meat and no added sugar – you can have moments where you let go. when your immune system is being battered by the disease, it’s even more important not to consume things that have been altered with synthetic chemicals and preservatives. And that includes sugar-laden ‘treats’ CHEMO… IN COMFORT . Chemotherapy is the use of medicines to kill or slow the growth of rapidly multiplying cancer cells. Once the medicines enter the bloodstream, they travel to all parts of the body in order to reach cancer cells that may have spread beyond the primary source. You will have heard about the sickness, nausea and hair loss that often accompany chemotherapy, but other side effects may include dry eyes, coldness, heartburn, a sore mouth, tingling hands and feet, and memory loss. Here’s how I dealt with some of the side effects from my treatment: . It is vitally important that you rest while undergoing treatment - you have to give in to fatigue . REST IS BEST . By the time I was into radiotherapy, I had endured eight operations, chemotherapy, and much more. I wrongly assumed I could do normal things, and would then find myself in a supermarket or at a children’s sports match in a desperate state. My point is you have to give in to fatigue. REST! REST! REST! And ACCEPT! ACCEPT! ACCEPT! To do this, you must feel comfortable delegating tasks to friends and family. If you are anything like me, it’s not easy. But you have to. Radiotherapy uses high levels of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing and dividing, while minimising damage to healthy cells. It is given to reduce your risk of local recurrence of the cancer and generally treatments start several weeks after surgery. It is very cold in the radiotherapy treatment rooms, which is necessary to keep these incredible machines cool. Bring a scarf, woolly socks and a hat. On the plus side, you feel nothing during the actual treatment, which lasts only a few minutes. CARE FOR YOUR SKIN . Moisturise your skin constantly but only use the ones that your clinic gives or authorises you to use . In the area exposed to radiation, your skin may become red, swollen, itchy, warm and sensitive, as if you have nasty sunburn. It may peel or become moist and tender. Gently cleanse the treated area using lukewarm water. I used to put moisturiser on first to act as a barrier cream and then get in the bath or shower. Do not submerge the treated area in the bath. And if you are showering, let the water trickle over it as little as possible. Don’t rub your skin. Pat it dry with a soft towel instead or use a hairdryer on a cool setting. Moisturise your skin constantly (I did it about three or four times a day). Only use the ones that your clinic gives or authorises you to use, because they must not contain aluminium or other chemicals. Don’t apply cosmetics, shaving lotions, perfumes or deodorants on the treated area, and use only an electric razor if you need to shave that part of your body. Make sure your baths are not too hot. I found this difficult as I was always freezing after treatments and longed for a hot, long soak. Avoid tight-fitting clothes that might irritate your skin, and keep the treated area out of direct sunlight. Always wear a very high factor sunblock, even after your course of treatment has finished.","Lucy O'Donnell was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2011 aged 47 .
Mother-of-three writes about her experience during and after chemo .
Here she gives advice to cancer sufferers on dos and dont's .
It is important to see a dentist before you start treatment to make sure your mouth is healthy. Chemotherapy affects the cells that line the mouth, so it becomes very dry. Any infection can run rife, meaning treatment must be stopped. It’s therefore important to head off any potential problems.
As chemo lowers the immune system, hygiene is very important. I travel everywhere with antibacterial hand gel. Anyone who had a cold wasn’t allowed to come near me as even a minor infection could have interrupted my treatment.
I also suffered from dry eyes and even blepharitis – infection in the eyelids linked to dry eyes. Moisturising sterile eye drops are hugely relieving and can help protect against this.
As my skin got terribly dry, I massaged in facial oils every night and used tinted SPF moisturiser during the day. I used to slather myself with body, hand, face and foot cream – always with natural products. I found that lots of bath oil helped too. This sounds laborious but it made a huge difference to my comfort.

"Ministers are set to offer £2million more in childcare grants to make Britain the female employment capital of Europe. Almost half a million women are expected to enter the labour market by the start of 2016 – largely thanks to government tax breaks. This would see the UK leapfrog Germany as the major economy with the highest female employment rate on the Continent. Chancellor George Osborne, on a two-day tour meeting 'women working in the UK economy', is helped to choose a Christmas tree for Number 11 Downing Street by Sadie Lynes owner of Marldon Christmas Tree Farm . Mr Osborne wants Britain to have the highest proportion of women in work in Europe . George Osborne welcomed the surge but said there was ‘more we can do to support women into work’. He revealed he was considering boosting a scheme to help those who want to set themselves up as childminders. But the plan will prove unpopular with those who believe the Coalition is denigrating stay-at-home mothers by encouraging women to put children into childcare and go out to work. At present, 67 per cent of working-age women in Britain are in work – a record high of 14.4million; behind Germany on 69.2 per cent. Analysis by the Treasury said that 450,000 extra women in jobs would enable us to close the gap. This is expected to happen by the start of 2016. The expected surge will also put Britain within touching distance of Canada, whose rate of 69.3 per cent is currently the highest in the G7 group of the richest nations. At present, 67 per cent of working-age women in Britain are in work – a record high of 14.4million; behind Germany on 69.2 per cent. File picture . Mr Osborne said: ‘Our long-term economic plan is all about creating jobs and the economic security that comes with that. ‘Today’s research shows women are playing an ever larger role in the economy, but it also makes clear that there’s more we can do to support women into work.’ Since 2010 the number of women in work has increased by more than 771,000. In the past year alone, the total has risen by 368,000 to 14.4million. But the analysis said: ‘We still have more to do to increase female employment.’ The Chancellor said the Government is considering pouring more funds into a scheme to help people who want to set up childcare businesses. The Treasury is looking at extending the scheme for another year, costing £2million, to support the creation of up to 50,000 further childcare places. Education Secretary Nicky Morgan, who is also minister for women, said: ‘Women are making huge strides in the economy and it’s vital their contributions are recognised. ‘No woman should have to choose between their career and their family. That’s why we’ve extended the right to request flexible working and from next year will allow parents to share leave following the birth of their child. ‘All three and four-year-olds now receive 15 hours of free childcare a week, extended to around 40 per cent of two-year-olds from disadvantaged backgrounds, and we’re also introducing tax-free childcare worth £2,000 per child.’ Meanwhile, a study by the Institute for Fiscal Studies casts doubt on claims that childcare schemes encouraged mothers to work. A scheme offering extra free nursery places for three-year-olds, launched in 1998, costs taxpayers £66,000 for every woman who has taken a job, they found.","UK could overtake Germany to take highest female employment rate .

"She’s 33 weeks pregnant with her second baby but that hasn’t stopped this mum from pumping iron. Brittany Hore, 22, is determined to keep fit while pregnant and has been working out at home while her fitness fanatic partner Freddy Arias and their one-year-old son Orlando keep a watchful eye. The qualified personal trainer, from Currans Hill, south west Sydney, does weights three times a week as part of a structured programme which she hasn’t stopped because of her growing bump. Brittany Hore is 33 weeks pregnant and still loves doing weights to keep fight . She does three 30-40 minute workouts every week to keep strong and says it isn't about being skinny . During her 30-40 minute workouts, Brittany does a variety of exercises including barbell curls, tricep dips and squats. At 33 weeks, babies weigh a little over 4 pounds and are about the size of a pineapple. Brittany previously worked out throughout her pregnancy with her first son Orlando and told Daily Mail Australia that people who criticise her need to educate themselves first. 'People definitely have their opinions, they think it's wrong for you to exercise because it looks like it can harm the baby but it's about doing the research,' she said. 'They don’t have the knowledge to know it's good for you. For those people that do judge, you should go and research and look into it,' she added. The 22-year-old does weights three times a week as part of a structured programme . Brittany's partner Freddy Arias and their one-year-old son Orlando like to help her work out . Brittany said if she feels sick one day then she won't train and she makes sure she doesn't push herself too hard . However, Brittany stressed that she has been exercising since the age of 16 and was doing weights before she was pregnant, while it's not advised for someone who has not lifted weights before to start when they are pregnant. The former body sculptor has halved the weights she is using and explained: 'I was doing weight training before... there’s no harm to the baby as long as its not strenuous on the body. 'It’s more about watching your breathing and making sure you are not over exerting your body and are keeping a reasonable heart rate.' Brittany said if she feels sick one day then she won't train. For her it is not about being skinny but about feeling healthy. Brittany stressed that she has been exercising since the age of 16 . It's not advised for someone who has not lifted weights before to start when they are pregnant . At 33 weeks, babies weigh a little over 4 pounds and are about the size of a pineapple . Brittany is pictured here after the birth of her first child, Orlando . 'You shouldn't worry about putting on weight. It's about embracing the changes your body goes through and what you feel is good,' she reasoned. Personal trainer Cassie White told Daily Mail Australia that while exercise in pregnancy can be a controversial issue it always comes down to the individual. 'It really depends on the woman and her previous experience with weights training. It's not recommended that a woman begin lifting heavy weights during pregnancy if she's completely new to it,' Cassie said. However, she explained: 'If she’s been training for a long period of time, is strong and confident, knows good technique, eats well and gets plenty of sleep, lifting weights is generally fine. It’s really about context and the individual.' Brittany has qualifications in fitness and has been working out for years . She is now a stay at home mum with her one-year-old son Orlando . Brittany said she does 30-40 minute workouts each time and that it is very Important to take 1-2 minute breaks between sets. Here is her 3 Day Split Program: . Monday: Lateral pull down (3 sets), Seated row (3 sets), Barbell curls (3 sets), Calf Raises (3 sets) Wednesday: Upright row (3 sets), Lateral raises (3 sets), Tricep dips (3 sets), Tricep kick backs (3sets) Friday: Barbell squats (3sets),Walking lunges (3sets), Leg extension (3sets), Calf raises (3sets) 'Exercise is great during pregnancy – it helps with the birth and makes it easier for mum to get back into shape afterwards. The psychological benefits are really high, too. It just needs to be safe and progressed,' Cassie added. 'When women are pregnant a hormone called relaxin is released, which relaxes off the joints. During the late stage of pregnancy women are more at risk of muscular skeletal injury, especially around the sacroiliac joint, which is in the pelvis. So they need to be careful of dynamic movements that put pressure on it. 'At 33 weeks it’s not about heavy loads, it’s about keeping active and feeling good about herself. 'Women should generally avoid doing exercises on their backs, be aware of blood pressure changes and single-leg work is generally too aggressive on the sacroiliac joint. But everyone is different when it comes to how much exercise they can handle and women just need to monitor themselves.'","Pregnant Brittany Hore, 22, does weights three times a week .

"There's a strict set of standards for organic foods. But the rules are looser for household cleaners, textiles, cosmetics and the organic dry cleaners down the street. It's a little known fact that the USDA doesn't regulate the use of the term 'organic' for any of such products, unless they're made entirely from food or agriculture products overseen by its National Organic Program. Companies, therefore, can brand their non-food products as ‘organic’ with little USDA oversight as long as they don't use the USDA organic seal or certification. Confusing: It's a little known fact that the USDA doesn't  regulate the use of the term 'organic' for many non-food products including cleaners, personal care products and textiles . When it comes to personal care products, clothing, bed linen or even some gardening products, a shopper's only way to be sure they are really buying organic, is do his or her own research. 'The consumer should not need a law degree to read a label,' says Laura Batcha, president of the Organic Trade Association, the industry's main trade group. Concerned about the image of organics, the association is pressuring the government to better investigate organic claims on non-food items. According to its figures, sales of these non-food organic items were about $2.8 billion last year, a small share of the overall organic market but growing rapidly; and unlike food, with very little regulation. Miles McEvoy, head of the USDA's National Organic Program maintains there are indeed clear standards for items within the scope of its regulation, but says: 'The areas that are outside of our scope could cause some confusion.' The Federal Trade Commission normally investigates deceptive claims. But the agency demurred in its 'Green Guides' published in 2012, saying enforcement of organic claims on non-food products could duplicate USDA duties. A claim is only deceptive if it misleads consumers, the agency says. So, it will study consumer perceptions of the word organic. But officials weren't able to say when such a study might begin. Lotions and potions: Sales of non-food organic items were about $2.8 billion last year, a small share of the overall organic market but growing rapidly; and unlike food, with very little regulation . Ms Batcha of the Organic Trade Association says the lack of enforcement could erode confidence in the organic industry as a whole. The industry has similarly been fighting overuse of the word 'natural,' which has no legal meaning at all. 'Companies are chasing the consumers and the government is in the rear-view mirror,' says Ken Cook, head of the Environmental Working Group, an advocacy group that publishes online consumer databases on cosmetics and cleaning. So what's a consumer to do, especially when organic products are often more expensive and the market is continuing to grow? Right now, retailers are the first line of defense. Four years ago, Whole Foods Market announced strict standards for labeling in the store's well-stocked cosmetics, home cleaning and clothing aisles. The retailer also requires all products to list ingredients. Joe Dickson, global quality standards coordinator for the Austin, Texas-based chain, says: 'In areas where there isn't a government regulation, we have stepped up to create our own.' Approved: Some retailers, including Whole Foods Market (items pictured), enforce strict standards for labeling in its cosmetics, home cleaning and clothing aisles . David Bronner, the president of Dr. Bronner's Magic Soaps, has fought for years to get the USDA to expand its powers on organics to include personal care products. He says Whole Foods' standards have helped clean up the market, but there are still less scrupulous companies that stretch the meaning of the word organic. Often this includes petroleum-based oils and non-organic palm and coconut oils - which are not generally perceived as organic by the general public - and make up the base of many personal care products. Some grocery stores, spas and online retailers have no standards at all; and some dry cleaners promote 'organic' on their windows and in their stores, despite there being no legal definition for the practice. Mary Scalco, CEO of the industry group Drycleaning and Laundry Institute, said some of those businesses may actually be using petroleum-based solutions. 'The difficult part is the scientific meaning of organic and the consumer perception of the word,' she says. 'Because there is no real regulation on this right now, you want to make sure you don't mislead the public.' Aside from Whole Foods, there do exist private certification agencies; including the NSF/ANSI 305 and the Global Organic Textile Standard, but most consumers don't know to look for that label. Mr Bronner's advice to shoppers is to read labels carefully and scan lists of ingredients. If you find several unpronounceable ingredients that sound like chemicals, 'it's probably not organic,' he says.","The USDA doesn't regulate the use of the term 'organic' for many items, unless they're made entirely from food or agriculture products ."
"A Supreme Court Judge has ruled a the boyfriend a murder victim is the prime suspect in an eminent cold case from nine years ago. Simone Strobel, a 25-year-old German kindergarten teacher, disappeared from a tourist park in Lismore, Northern NSW, on February the 11th  2005. Her naked body was found hidden under a palm tree one week later. She was found to have been suffocated with a pillow or a plastic bag. Despite substantial investigations, the case remains unsolved. West Australian Supreme Court Judge Kenneth Martin has argued Strobel's boyfriend at the time, Tobias Moran, (left) is the prime suspect in the murder of Simone Strobel (right) Simone Strobel's body was found hidden at a camp site in 2005. Forensic investigations found she had been suffocated with a pillow or plastic bag . In June, Moran  filed for an injunction to stop Schwartz Publishing Pty Ltd releasing a book, Have You Seen Simone?, by author Virginia Peters, on the grounds that it 'seriously defamed him'. The case was handled by West Australian Supreme Court Judge Kennet Martin, who this week has published his rejection of the order. Martin has said there is 'reasonable suspicion' that Strobel's boyfriend at the time, Tobias Moran-formerly Tobias Suckfuell-was behind her death. Yahoo News reported that Martin said: 'The proximity of Simone's discovered body (within 90m of the Lismore caravan park), the plaintiff's (Suckfuell/Moran) lack of a solid alibi in terms of his overall movements on the evening before Simone left, some arguably odd behaviour by him in terms of him not searching for Simone the next morning (he denies that) and some delay in reporting Simone's disappearance to the Australian police, this goes towards providing a basis for a reasonable suspicion about the plaintiff. 'Suspicion must inevitably fall upon this plaintiff as regards this unsolved crime'. Strobel's body was found 90 metres from where she was staying with Moran in a Lismore Caravan park. A new hearing shows they had been arguing heavily on the night of her disappearance . The hearing also showed that Moran has misled the investigation. Strobel and Moran had been arguing  in the days leading up to her disappearance. They were also drinking heavily on the night of her disappearance, and had returned to the camping they were staying at site to smoke marijuana. Martin said that these details were denied by Moran, hereby misleading the investigation. However, he ruled that 'there is no forensic evidence at this point supporting a conclusion that the plaintiff was her murderer.' Earlier this year, German authorities have offered a $15,000 reward for information about her death.","Simone Strobel's body was found hidden at a northern NSW camp site in 2005 .

"Lynsey Pow, pictured with her husband Ashley House, found hanged after battling with drug and gambling problems, an inquest has heard . An actress who appeared in BBC dramas Waterloo Road and Doctors took her own life after a battle with drug and gambling problems, an inquest has heard. Lynsey Pow, 34, who also appeared alongside Billie Piper in hit drama Secret Diary Of A Call Girl, was found dead at her flat in Honor Oak Park, south east London, next to opened bank statements which revealed her gambling debts. Her father James Pow has claimed his daughter - who had reverted to using cocaine because she felt like a 'failure' - 'could have been saved'. An inquest at Southwark coroner's court heard how Ms Pow phoned her husband shortly before her death to apologise for racking up debts through gambling. She also told Ashley House, a Eurosport TV presenter, that she had bought some cocaine, the court was told. After the phone call on November 28 last year, Mr House rushed back home, concerned about his wife's welfare. But she was found hanging, surrounded by drugs paraphernalia. She had also left a note. A post-mortem examination found traces of cocaine and alcohol in her body, the court was told. In a statement read out at the inquest, her father James Pow described how he had tried to take his daughter away from her husband a month before her death. He said he wanted to take her to his home in Scotland to get her help with her drug use. In the statement, it said: 'I sought to separate my daughter from her husband after he failed to fulfil his marriage vows to act as a custodian and guardian.' Dr Johan Hugo, a GP who met Ms Pow six weeks before her death, told the court that the actress had revealed she 'felt like a failure'. She told the doctor she was using cocaine on a daily basis and had tried to self-harm. Ms Pow was prescribed anti-depressants and referred for psychiatric treatment. But less than a fortnight later, the actress told Dr Hugo she had stopped taking illegal drugs, claiming she felt like a 'different person'. A month later, she was found dead. Assistant Coroner Sarah Ormond-Walshe recorded a narrative verdict at her inquest at Southwark coroner's court, describing it as a 'drug-related, self-harm death' Assistant Coroner Sarah Ormond-Walshe recorded a narrative verdict, describing it as a 'drug-related, self-harm death'. She said the presence of drugs in Ms Pow's system meant it was impossible to say whether she intended to commit suicide. She told the court: '[Ms Pow] appeared to have obtained some cocaine and while under the influence of cocaine she appeared to hang herself. 'It is likely to have influenced her mind so it cannot be said that she intended to die. I am recording this as a drug-related self-harm death.' Ms Pow's father said he was pleased the coroner did not record a suicide verdict because his daughter's death had been a results of her relapse into drugs. He told the Evening Standard: 'She was getting better. The tragedy is that she could have been saved. 'We did everything we could when we found out about the drugs. Lynsey touched so many lives. There were 1,400 people at her memorial service. 'The only thing that has helped is that it has brought our family even closer together.' Mr House did not speak at or after the inquest.

"A husband and wife have been charged in the death of their 9-year-old son, whose decomposing body was found in a 'feces-covered room' in their home this past August. Police filed criminal homicide charges earlier today against Kimberly A. Tutko and Jarrod N. Tutko Sr., of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, saying their neglect caused the death of their son Jarrod Jr. Jarrod Jr., who was diagnosed with Fragile X syndrome as an infant, weighed just 17 pounds at the time of his death, and had been locked in his bedroom by his parents. charged: Kimberly (left) and Jarrod Tutko Sr. (right) have been charged in the death of their son, Jarrod Jr. Appalling conditions: Jarrod Jr.'s decomposing body was found in his 'feces covered room' (above) Special needs: Jarrod Jr. (above as an infant) had been diagnosed with Fragile X Syndrome . His cause of death was determined to be malnutrition and neglect. Dauphin County District Attorney Ed Marsico said Monday that Jarrod Jr. was in what he called a horrible condition at the time of his death in July. 'To think of this young boy in that room day in and day out, locked in there like an animal, left to fend without food, without nourishment,' Marsico told WHTM-TV. 'It's as horrific a case as we can imagine for someone that innocent.' A 10-year-old girl who was close to death was also found in the home and needed urgent medical attention. Authorities allege that both parents failed to provide 'even the most basic needs' of the child. Jarrod Jr. suffered from a range of developmental problems including learning disabilities and cognitive impairment as a result of his syndrome. Mother from hell: An emotional Kimberly (above) cries during a vigil for her son earlier this year . Pristine: Another room in the home (above) is show to be well kept and perfectly clean . According to The Patriot-News the couple, who have six children between the ages of three and 13, have a lengthy, and chilling, history with Children and Youth services. Kimberly, 39, also has three children from her first marriage she gave up her parental rights to. Jarrod Jr. was taken from his parents custody multiple times over the course of his life, and when, in 2005, a doctor advised Jarrod Sr., 38, to take his son to the hospital because of his 'history of losing weight and developmental delays,' he said 'No' and hung up the phone according to court records. Another court document states that a sibling told one case worker who recently visited the home that Jared Jr. had a wet forehead because he 'had feces on himself which the father had attempted to wash off.' Remembering Jarrod: Many in the neighborhood remembered Jarrod at a vigil earlier this year (above), leaving stuffed animals in memory of the boy . She also stated, 'dad doesn't care about Jarrod Junior anymore,' according to the complaint. The room the boy was found in had 'feces-covered floors and walls, a non-working light, no furniture but a television and a doorknob that locked from the outside.' Both parents were aware of their son's deplorable living conditions.","Kimberly and Jarrod Tutko of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, have been charged in the death of their son, Jarrod Jr.

"For most people, the question is whether to have curry with naan bread or papadum. But for one man, it was served up with a three-inch centipede. Jason Damms, 41, from West Malling, Kent, purchased a chicken tikka masala ahead of a quiet Saturday night in with his girlfriend, Kim Wakefield. Jason Damms, 41, said he was 'disgusted' to find the centipede in his chicken tikka masala meal . But as the couple sat down to enjoy their Tesco microwaved meal, Mr Damms spotted the centipede in the curry sauce. Mr Damms, a warehouse manager at a firm, said: 'I sat down to eat the curry and this thing crawled out of the middle. 'It has really put me off my food and I haven't shopped at Tesco since. It's disgusting.' Mr Damms said the centipede must have been in the curry when he purchased it, as he only pierced the film when he sat down to eat it. Mr Damms received an apology letter from Tesco and said he must have been 'disappointed' to find the centipede in his curry . Staff at Tesco, who thought it might have been a caterpillar, said they would freeze it and send it off for testing. He later received a letter from Tesco, with a £15 gift card as a gesture of goodwill. The letter said: 'I am sorry to hear that you found a caterpillar in the tikka masala and I can appreciate how disappointing this would have been. I'd like to reassure you how rare it is. 'Despite our precautions you still found a caterpillar in your chicken tikka masala and pilau rice.' A spokesman for Tesco said: 'We set ourselves very high standards for the safety and quality of our products.

"Thousands of people are being treated ‘like cattle’ by modern slavery gangs who tattoo them and force them to work for a pittance. The number of victims smuggled in Britain has soared by a fifth as organised criminals cash in on the lucrative market in human misery. They are expanding their operations from the sex trade and drug factories into hand car washes and bogus doorstep charity collections. Scroll down for video . Thousands of people are being treated ‘like cattle’ by modern slavery gangs who tattoo them and force them to work for a pittance . Victims are bought and sold for as little as £200 and put to work in fear of violence against them and their families. Many are Eastern Europe children brought into the country to join street begging gangs while their handlers steal their generous benefits. Adults are duped into travelling here, often through recruitment websites or even dating agencies, with the promise of better paid work or education. But when they arrive they are forced to work as prostitutes, on illicit cannabis farms, as construction labourers or on isolated farms. There is also a growing number of British victims, many of whom are homeless and vulnerable, who are enslaved by travellers who use them as cheap labour. Liam Vernon, of the National Crime Agency (NCA), said: ‘This is an insidious and complex crime and much of the exploitation is hidden from view. ‘Victims are being forced to work in private houses and hospitality, farming, manufacturing and construction industries. In many cases, threats and violence are used.’ Asked about crime gangs tattooing their victims, he added that numbers or other symbols are used to ‘signify ownership’. He added: ‘It’s a branding it’s as simple as that. You brand cattle, I can put it in no more stark terms. ‘That is how offenders view people – as a commodity that can be bought and sold. That comes at the price of misery and real physical and psychological harm.’ Research by the UK Human Trafficking Centre, part of the NCA, estimates there were 2,744 victims of human smuggling last year, compared with 2,255 in 2012. Victims came from 86 countries worldwide, with most trafficked victims from Romania and Poland. Shockingly, a fifth of all those enslaved, 602 victims, are children, many of whom are forced to beg, into prostitution or to work as domestic slaves. Almost all of those cruelly brought to Britain to milk the benefits system while begging on the streets are from Slovakia. There is also growing evidence of victims being forced to work on hand car washes, which have mushroomed on disused petrol station forecourts. The men are houses in cramped and dirty multiple occupancy homes while being forced to work long hours for little or no pay. Others are trafficked into the country to steal charity bags for organised groups who make huge sums reselling them to the rag and scrap industry. Police have discovered some gangs are creating their own fake bags to imitate legitimate charities or intercepting genuine collections. In June, a woman who exploited vulnerable Lithuanian immigrants to work door-to-door collecting ‘Dreams Come True’ charity bags was jailed for three years. Jurate Grigelyte, 53, offered her victims good jobs and accommodation but left them to go hungry while working for as little as £25 a day. Surprisingly, one in 14 victims of trafficking are British, including many homeless people conned into working as cheap manual labour by traveller families. Some are even sent to work in Sweden and Norway where they spend 14-hour days paving roads and driveways. In 2012 several members of the Connors crime family were jailed forcing homeless drug addicts and alcoholics forced to work as slaves. The travellers lived luxurious lifestyles at the expense of their victims who were paid £5 a day for heavy labouring work and often hosed down as a punishment. Chief Constable Shaun Sawyer, who has national responsibility for tackling slavery, said no part of Britain is ‘immune’ from the crime. He said: ‘As our knowledge and understanding of this abhorrent crime grows it reinforces the need for continued and improving efforts to protect victims and bring offenders to justice.’","The number of victims smuggled in Britain has soared by a fifth .

"Tens of thousands of patients are dying needlessly in hospital every year from kidney failure linked to dehydration, NHS officials have revealed. They calculate that up to 42,000 deaths a year would be avoided if staff ensured patients had enough to drink and carried out simple tests. NICE, the NHS watchdog, is today issuing guidelines to staff to help them prevent deaths from the condition – known as acute kidney injury – which is common in the  elderly and patients with heart disease,  diabetes and blood infections. Tracy Holmes said she had to smuggle ice lollies in to hospital after nurses left her mother Sandra Aston so thirsty her lips cracked and bled . Mrs Aston was admitted to Redditch Alexandra Hospital in April last year suffering with inoperable lung cancer and secondary liver cancer . It is estimated that a fifth of all patients attending A&E every year – one million people – suffer from the illness, of whom an estimated 210,000 die. Tens of thousands of these deaths are due to dehydration and are avoidable with better care, with one kidney expert accusing doctors and nurses of ‘taking their eye off the ball’. The latest estimate is far higher than any previous figure. In 2009, a Care Quality Commission report said the number dying in hospitals because of dehydration was just 900 a year. The family of Sandra Aston, 79, have told how they smuggled ice lollies in to Redditch Alexandra Hospital after nurses left her so thirsty her lips cracked and bled. Mrs Aston was ‘treated like an animal’ by nurses, who claimed they could not help when her family begged them to act as she became increasingly dehydrated. While she was too weak to drink from a cup, her thirst could have been quenched with oral sponges. But staff did not provide these, leaving her family to feed her ice lollies they bought outside. Mrs Aston (pictured with her daughter, Tracy Holmes) was initially misdiagnosed with pneumonia when she was admitted to Redditch Alexandra Hospital before X-rays revealed she had inoperable lung cancer . As they finally received a formal apology from the hospital, Mrs Aston’s family yesterday spoke of their ongoing distress about the way she was left to die with so little dignity. Her daughter Tracy Holmes, 51, who lived close to her mother and father Robert, 80, in Evesham, Worcestershire, said medical staff deprived her dying mother of ‘basic human dignity’ in her final days. ‘My mother was left dehydrated, with no monitoring of her fluid or food intake,’ she added. ‘We constantly found her freezing cold, with cracked bleeding lips and in considerable distress due to her discomfort and desperate thirst. We even took to bringing her ice lollies because the hospital was unable to provide oral sponges. We fear that if we had not been there then Mum would have received nothing at all.’ She said the care received by her mother was ‘appalling’ and ‘no better than that given to a helpless animal’. After three days of persistent complaints, nurses finally began using wet sponges on Mrs Aston’s lips. The trust’s chief nursing officer Helen Blanchard has written to Mrs Holmes, offering a ‘heartfelt and sincere’ apology. She added: ‘We have taken action to improve care.’ Mrs Aston (pictured with her husband, Robert, in 1983) was left freezing cold, dehydrated and in great discomfort by staff at the hospital. Her family say that her lips cracked because they were so dry . The new guidelines come amid growing concern about the standard of NHS care, with several damning reports highlighting appalling neglect in some hospitals. NICE says the condition cannot be blamed on poor nursing, because it often develops before patients are admitted to hospital, but experts say NHS staff are not doing enough to detect the illness and prevent it from getting worse. Professor Donal O’Donoghue, a former national director of Kidney Care who works at Salford Royal Hospital in Greater Manchester, said: ‘It’s the vulnerable, frail elderly who are affected. It is estimated that a fifth of all patients attending A&E every year - one million people - suffer from acute kidney injury, of whom an estimated 210,000 die (file picture) ‘They don’t get adequate fluids – they don’t feel like drinking, so they don’t request them. ‘The doctors and nurses think about the fall, the pneumonia or whatever else is affecting them and take their eye off the ball in terms of the kidneys. ‘By the time it’s noticed, it’s often very late in the day and too late.’ Acute kidney injury describes the sudden shut-down of the kidneys. If detected early enough, the condition can be treated by giving patients extra fluids or putting them on a dialysis machine. The condition can also be caused by NSAID (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug) painkillers and ACE inhibitor drugs, and doctors are urged to stop prescribing these immediately if patients are affected. It is rarely recorded on death certificates, because doctors don’t realise patients are suffering from it. Dr Mark Thomas, a kidney specialist at the Heart of England NHS trust in Birmingham who helped draw up the guidelines, said acute kidney injury killed more people than any of the common cancers. He added: ‘In the past, the care for this condition has not always been uniformly good, partly because the patients have tended to present to a range of non-specialists who may have been unfamiliar with the best prevention and treatment of the condition. ‘Many hospitals and healthcare professionals have been doing an excellent job in watching out for acute kidney injury in their patients, but unfortunately this good practice is not seen everywhere. Not only can we save lives with this guideline but the money we save could be put back into general NHS care.’ The guidelines tell doctors and staff to carry out simple checks to detect the condition in patients over 65, particularly those with dementia or other conditions whereby they are dependent on someone else to give them water. Other high-risk groups include those with heart failure, liver disease, diabetes or blood infections. NICE says the condition cannot be blamed on poor nursing, but experts say NHS staff are not doing enough to detect the illness and prevent it from getting worse (file picture) Doctors and nurses are urged to carry . out simple urine tests to measure the levels of the chemical serum . creatine, which are high if patients have kidney failure. Staff are also told to ensure patients have enough fluids and to check whether patients are dehydrated by looking for signs such as dry skin and sunken eyes. 'Many hospitals and healthcare . professionals have been doing an excellent job in watching out for acute . kidney injury in their patients, but unfortunately this good practice . is not seen everywhere' - Dr Mark Thomas . Dr Peter Carter, general secretary of the Royal College of Nursing, said: ‘This guidance should help doctors and nurses to spot those patients who are at risk and be confident in monitoring and treating them. ‘This is an area of medicine where many lives could be saved if the level of understanding is the same among staff in all settings, and the NHS as a whole should act on this guidance as a matter of urgency.’ The guidance makes no mention of the Liverpool Care Pathway whereby fluid, food and other drugs are withdrawn from patients who are believed to be close to death. But as the condition is primarily caused by dehydration, it could affect some patients on the pathway.","Tens of thousands dying in hospital from kidney failure linked to dehydration .

Clayton Pettet, 19, said he will have gay sex for the first time in a gallery for a project entitled 'Art School Stole My Virginity'. He said his 'performance art project' - followed by a question and answer session -  will challenge the idea of sexuality. He is planning for his first full sexual encounter is set to take place before an audience of between 50 and 100 in a space in Hackney, London. Clayton and his partner will have protected sex and then ask the audience what they thought of the performance. Clayton, who has been planning the event for three years, said: 'The key thing about performance art is that it should only be performed once, and this is the ultimate once-in-a-lifetime performance. 'I've held on to my virginity for 19 years, and I'm not throwing it away lightly. 'Basically it's like I am losing the stigma around virginity. 'I want the audience to see if anything has changed between me and my partner. 'Since culturally we do hold quite a lot of value to the idea of virginity I have decided to use mine and the loss of it to create a piece that I think will stimulate interesting debate and questions regarding the subject.' Clayton has not told his parents about the project, but has informed tutors at the prestigious university. But the . second-year student at Central Saint Martins art school in London has . been accused of cheapening sex and art with the stunt, which will take place . on January 25 next year. Clayton Pettet said his 'performance art project' - followed by a question and answer session -  will challenge the idea of sexuality . The Lesbian and Gay Christian . Movement reckon the project is not art and cheapens the special . relationship of sex between loving partners. Spokesman Rev Sharon Ferguson said: 'I'm not quite sure how that's art. 'My view . is that we believe that all sexuality is a gift from God. 'It's about what you do with it and how we use it is an expression of our love for God. He is planning for his first full sexual encounter is set to take place before an audience of between 50 and 100 in a space in Hackney, London . 'For my imagining in sex as an art form, I don't think this falls into that category. 'My issue is around is this the right expression of someone's bodily sexuality? As an art project in front of an audience, where is the love, respect and mutuality in that? 'Stunts like this cheapens our own sexual relationships.' Alex Schady, Programme Director of Fine Art, Central Saint Martins, . said: 'Clayton Pettet’s project is not part of his course and has not . been endorsed by Central Saint Martins. 'Staff are discussing with him . the implications, both legal and emotional, of the performance and he is . exploring the possibility of alternative means of expression.'","Clayton Pettet, 19, said he will have gay sex for the first time in a gallery .

"Vinnie Jones said his native England is 'past its sell-by date' and claims immigration has made it an unrecognisable 'European country' His journey from tough-tackling footballer to movie hard man has taken him from Watford to Los Angeles. And Vinnie Jones has revealed he has no plans to return to England any time soon, saying immigration has turned us into a completely unrecognisable ‘European country’. The 48-year-old actor said he has to remind himself of home by importing boxes of Walkers crisps to the US and buying bottles of Ribena for $14 (£9) each. He told the Radio Times: ‘There’s nothing to come back to here. To me, England is past its sell-by date. 'It’s not the country I grew up in. It’s a European country now. If someone blindfolded you and put you on a plane in LA, and you landed at Heathrow and they took it off, you wouldn’t have a clue where you were.’ The star and father of two – who once suggested he would run for election as an MP – said he was ‘not familiar’ with the policies of UKIP (UK Independence Party which is seeking Britain’s withdrawal from the European Union). But he added: ‘I just think we should get our own house in order before we open our doors. It’s mind-boggling to me.’ Born in Watford, Mr Jones earned a reputation as a combative footballer for Wimbledon and Leeds United before achieving on-screen fame in Guy Ritchie’s gangster film Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels in 1998. Since 2000, he has lived with his wife Tanya and their daughter in a mansion in Mulholland Drive, in Hollywood. They fly a large Union flag on the front lawn. Saying the weather in Britain is ‘depressing’, the star insisted he has all the comforts he could need in the U.S, including Premier League football on TV – although he complained ‘foreign players’ and ‘foreign managers’ are ruining the game.

'A bottle of Ribena is $14. But I get my Walkers crisps delivered once a month. I have a box of Roast Chicken, a box of Salt and Vinegar, and a box of Monster Munch.’ Read Vinnie's full interview in this week's Radio Times . He added: ‘People say you can get bored of the sunshine in LA. No, you can’t. 'I play golf six days a week, and I’ve still got my football team, the Hollywood All-Stars. Those are my two main things.’ Mr Jones, shamlessly namedrops throughout his interview and claimed he has ‘massive credibility’ in the U.S. because of his background as a professional sportsman and recalled a conversation he had with Hollywood star Nicholas Cage. He said: ‘People say, ""What’s it like working with Stallone, and all that?"" But I’ll tell you something. Americans are crazy about sport. [Basketball star] Kobe Bryant is bigger than Brad Pitt. 'Even the President wants to shoot hoops with Kobe Bryant…Nic Cage said to me, ""Hey man, I didn’t know you were a pro soccer player, that’s awesome"". It means I’m going in on an even keel with them.’ In 2008, Mr Jones was arrested and charged with assault after a violent bar brawl in the U.S. in which he was glassed in the face. He was later cleared of all charges. Last year, his marriage came under strain when he was pictured kissing a 26-year-old Russian singer while filming his latest TV series in Moscow. But despite his controversial reputation and penchant for playing thugs and gangsters, Mr Jones revealed he has a secret love for gentle nature documentaries. He said: ‘If you want to know what makes me emotional, it’s nature stuff. I haven’t got Tarantino’s films on my iPad, I’ve got Attenborough. 'Growing up, [former England manager] Glenn Hoddle was my hero. But away from football, it was Attenborough. And it still is.’","Former hardman footballer turned film star slams country of birth .

"Communities Secretary Eric Pickles said speaking English is crucial to allow us to come together and be part of British society . Supermarket workers are to be given badges to identify them as immigrant-friendly so they can be approached by those who want to practise their English. Under a bizarre scheme to be launched today, checkout staff at Asda and the Co-op will be employed as ‘sympathetic listeners’ so those with poor English can brush up their language skills. More than £6million of public money will be spent on new projects to coax those who don’t speak English to finally learn the language. Announcing the plans, Communities Secretary Eric Pickles warned that those who fail to speak English ‘are condemned to a limited life’. Recent census figures showed that across England 1.7 per cent of the population - more than a million people - have either no, or poor spoken English. That figure rises to 9 per cent in some London boroughs where one in three inhabitants was born abroad. Under the plans, language classes will be held in mosques, churches and Sikh gurdwaras in order to reach those people who have not got access to language training. Language classes will be focused on practical themes, rather than classroom English, so immigrants can learn how to engage with schools, hospitals and other public services and how to discuss social activities such as cooking and gardening. Those who are struggling will also be encouraged to help design their own courses and local volunteers will be recruited to hold informal conversations with those who a struggling. A source at the Department for Communities and Local Government said: ‘Training staff in supermarkets to be ‘sympathetic listeners’ to encourage learners to practise their English in-store - badges will make trained listeners easily identifiable.’ That project will get the go ahead in outlets of Asda and Coop in Manchester and Yorkshire. There will also be new language projects in Birmingham, Leicester, Blackburn, Bradford, Oldham, Sheffield, Rochdale, Bristol, Luton and Slough. In London 15 boroughs will be targeted: Brent, Camden, Ealing, Enfield, Hackney, Hammersmith and Fulham, Haringey, Harrow, Hounslow, Lambeth, Newham, Redbridge, Tower Hamlets, Waltham Forest and Westminster. Help: Staff will help people practise their English at outlets of Asda and Coop in Manchester and Yorkshire . The projects were selected after ministers were told that traditional English language classes are not always suited to the people who need them the most - such as those who are often socially and economically isolated by their lack of English. Mr Pickles said: ‘Speaking English is crucial to allow us to come together and be part of British society. People are unable to do this and are condemned to a limited life if they can’t speak our language. ‘To be a proper functioning citizen you must be able to speak English. Those who can’t are missing out much of British society, such as participating in civic life, talking to neighbours, or popping to the shops. ‘These fantastic projects will have a positive impact on local communities, enabling people to fulfil their potential, to communicate with friends and neighbours, gain employment and increase self-confidence.’ Mr Pickles hopes that investing in new ways of improving language skills will also lead to reduced translation and interpretation costs for local public services - money which he believes could be better directed at services that will benefit all residents and communities. He added: ‘Far too much taxpayers money has been wasted by councils on translation services, reducing the motivation to learn English and leaving too many people isolated at home and unable to get on. ‘We want to give more people the opportunities to participate fully in their communities, without being held back because they can’t speak the language.’","Communities Secretary Eric Pickles reveals plan to encourage English .

"People in Britain must stop flushing their toilets so often, the EU has declared. Brussels wants to impose a new bog standard flush across the continent to reduce water use after splashing out £72,000 on a study into toilet habits in 26 countries. The bizarre edict on cistern size from Eurocrats suggests David Cameron’s hopes of cutting unnecessary regulations has gone down the pan. Panned: The European Commission spent £76,000 on a study looking at how much water different countries using flushing the toilets . Already dubbed the ‘euroflush’, Brussels wants to standardise toilet flushes across the EU. It wants toilets to be limited to five litres and urinals one litre. A ‘half-flush’ will be allowed three litres, according to a draft of the policy. Cisterns in the UK can contain up to six litres of water, but older toilets could be even bigger. The European Commission launched a detailed study, costing £72,000 into the toilet habits of the continent. Urinals would be banned from using more than one litre of water, under EU plans . It found that people in the UK flush the . most, using 1,125 million cubic metres of water in home toilets in . 2010, followed by Italy (1,074) and Germany (1,021), The Times reported. Across the EU a quarter of all domestic water use was used by toilets, but in Britain the figure was higher at 30 per cent – beaten only by 33 per cent in Luxembourg. By comparison people Finland flushed the least, at 14 per cent of all household water usage. A 122-page report on toilet flushing was produced by the Commission, which concluded: ‘Two key elements appear to affect the water consumption of flushing toilets and urinals: their design and the user behaviour. ‘User behaviour is a crucial aspect and must be without any doubts emphasised. ‘The user behaviour analysis carried out showed how the average water consumption differs among the EU member states. Also the consumption between citizens of one country may vary very significantly.’ Paul Nuttall, deputy leader of the UK Independence Party, said it was a 'preposterous waster of money'. He added: 'They admit in their report that there are significant cultural differences in latrine etiquette. 'The bottom line is they are talking about red-tape all the time but instead we are spending two and a half years on a 60-page report to tray and harmonise loo behaviour amongst the peoples of Europe . 'Surely what goes on behind the bathroom door should be left to the people who are behind it. It is money down the pan.' Regulations: The revelation comes after David Cameron struck a deal with European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso to cut Brussels red-tape . The report also found that Britain has 45.3 million private and public toilets, the fourth highest number in the EU. Germany . has the most at 77 million, followed by Spain (49.2 million) and Italy . (46.5 million). Italy has the most urinals in Europe - 8.2 million. All this work will be used as part of EU plans to impose an ’Eco-label’ on goods sold across the continent. But . this rush to create more regulations appears at odds with Mr Cameron’s . insistence that EU red-tape is ‘throttling’ British business. Last week he struck a deal with José Manuel Barroso, the European Commission President, that Brussels move to reduce bureaucratic recommendations. An EU spokesman said: ‘We will propose next week criteria under which member states can award Ecolabel status to products, in this case toilets and urinals. 'Eco-label criteria help consumers, businesses, local authorities etc, who want to buy green products, know which product to choose.’","European Commission spends £72,000 on study into toilet habits .

"Speaking out: Tory business and education minister Matthew Hancock has urged bosses to hire Britons rather than immigrants . Firms have a duty to hire Britons rather than immigrants, a minister declared last night. Matthew Hancock urged bosses to avoid the ‘easy option’ of filling jobs with foreign workers when they could train local recruits instead. Courting controversy, the Tory business and education minister insisted that taking on British employees was better both for firms and the wider economy. The Coalition’s immigration clampdown means foreigners now take 55 per cent of vacancies compared with 74 per cent under Labour when Gordon Brown pledged ‘British jobs for British workers’. But Mr Hancock believes firms can bring the figure even lower. ‘As vacancies rise, and unemployment falls further, it is the duty of companies, especially big business, to take on local young people – not immediately take the easy option of recruiting from abroad,’ he said. His intervention reflects official fears of an influx of Romanians and Bulgarians when restrictions on their rights to work here end in January. Mr Hancock rejected a claim from the independent Office of Budget Responsibility that 60,000 foreign workers are needed annually to keep national debt at sustainable levels. ‘I don’t agree,’ he told the Mail. ‘Immigration without support for people who are here masks problems. 'It doesn’t solve them. The jobs are increasingly there – we’ve got record numbers of jobs. ‘What we are talking about is making sure local people have a chance to get them. ‘It is sometimes harder to take on a young unemployed local person but, in the long term, it’s better for the business and it’s better for the whole economy. ‘The evidence shows that if you take on somebody and put them through an apprenticeship or a traineeship, you get somebody who has an attachment to the company which has given them a chance, and you get higher morale not only among the people you take on but also existing staff. Worried: Mr Hancock's intervention reflects official fears of an influx of Romanians and Bulgarians when restrictions on their rights to work here end in January . ‘They know a company is doing right by the local community.’ Mr Hancock, who is a close ally of Chancellor George Osborne, said he understood why so many firms had taken on immigrants. But he added: ‘To build a strong, long-term economy we have got to play our part in government and businesses need to take their responsibility. 'The jobs are increasingly there – we’ve got record numbers of jobs. What we are talking about is making sure local people have a chance to get them.' Matthew Hancock MP . ‘The easiest way for me to get a group of business people to nod their heads is to say that for far too long people coming out of our education system haven’t had what it takes to hold down a job. ‘It’s about the correct attitude, as well as skills in English and maths. We are doing a series of things in terms of reform of education and welfare to address this and we are supporting apprenticeships and traineeships for those who need better skills.’ Mr Hancock, who is responsible for skills and has posts in both the business and education ministries, said the Government would launch a traineeship scheme next month to improve English and maths skills. He added: ‘We need employers to play their part because experience of a job is vital for getting a job. ‘We are making it as easy as possible for employers to play their part so they have no excuse for not taking on and training up young unemployed people. Not local: Bulgarian immigrant workers, pictured working on Vegetable Market Gardens,  in Southport, Lancashire . ‘Many companies do this already – McDonald’s has a strong apprenticeship scheme, as do many manufacturers like JLR and BAe. Companies like HSBC, Brompton bicycles and Mercedes are backing the new traineeships. ‘But only 7 per cent of companies currently have an apprentice. 'It would be wrong for companies without an apprenticeship scheme to recruit from overseas without looking at what they can do to take on local people.’ Several European countries have recently imposed some limited immigration controls  on EU nationals – controls  that are legally permitted by the EU in ‘exceptional circumstances’. In 2011, Spain won the right to reintroduce immigration controls on Romanian migrants as unemployment soared. David Cameron has set out plans to reinforce rules restricting access to benefits, the NHS and social housing for European immigrants. Ministers are introducing a healthcare levy expected to be at least £200 a year to ensure migrants contribute toward the cost of NHS care. EU law requires companies to consider applications for vacancies from EU nationals. But employers can say they need fluent English speakers for a job and reject a foreign worker on those grounds. The Government has introduced a cap on the number of skilled workers from outside the EU, in an effort to reduce net migration to the ‘tens of thousands’. There have been calls for a crackdown on employment agencies that focus on immigrant workers.

"Picture this: you've taken the week off work and booked a holiday on a remote tropical beach. You land, drop of your things and walk down to the shore...Only to find a formidable mountain of thongs, plastic bottles and false teeth. Late last month, three tonnes of junk washed up on Old Mapoon beach, a remote and tropical area in far northern Queensland . A team of Indigenous rangers and workers from the Tangaroa Blue Foundation spent five days clearing the seven-kilometre shoreline . A turtle hatchling scrambles for the surf on Mapoon beach. It is believed that a third of turtle deaths in Australia happen from plastic ingestion . Late last month, three tonnes of junk washed up on Old Mapoon beach in northern Queensland. A team of Indigenous rangers and workers from the charity Tangaroa Blue Foundation spent five gruelling days cleaning the seven-kilometre shoreline. Amongst the expanse of waste they found fishing nets, false teeth, bags full of plastic bottles (some filled with urine) and an enormous army of toy soldiers. Heidi Taylor, the co-founder of Tangoroa, said her company got word of the waste from a local team of rangers. ‘We work closely with the local waste rangers. They said they had seen a lot of waste washing up in the direction of Mapoon beach, which is a hotspot for Marine debris. ‘It’s a very desolate area without many communities, so the rangers were naturally overwhelmed by the project and they called on us to come and help out.’ Mapoon is on the Gulf of Carpentaria, which gets a large amount of stray waste from the Arufuru Sea in Asia. The current then moves on towards the Northern Territory, harming all marine life in it's path. Taylor said the labels on much of the waste showed it had come from foreign shores. ‘The labels suggest the waste was predominantly from south-east Asia, which is consistent with our prior experience.’ Taylor said that since much of the waste was plastic, it can stick around in the ocean until a big tide comes and washes it ashore. 'The fact that most of the waste is coming from international waters certainly makes it more difficult to tackle as an issue.

It is believed that a third of turtle deaths in Australia happen from plastic ingestion. Amongst the masses of junk on the beach, the remains of local turtles were found. 'We need to work at this from a federal level using government agencies. It's the only way we can really have an impact on the waste disposal from our neighbouring countries. 'Some of this waste is coming from third world countries where there is barely no recycling institutions. The only way to impact this is through government co-operation.' Taylor says the issue is only going to get worse. 'The bottom-line is that our population is increasing. And more people means more waste. 'Tackling pollution needs to be a two pronged approach. We need to continue to build teams to clean up the areas that are badly effected, but we also need to look at the data and put pressure on the companies that are producing the most waste and ask them to take more responsibility.'

"Race row footballer Luis Suarez today apologised for refusing to shake the hand of Patrice Evra before Manchester United's ill-tempered match with Liverpool yesterday. The Uruguayan striker had come face-to-face with Evra at Old Trafford yesterday for the first time since his eight-match ban for racially abusing the United captain last October. But one day after being branded a 'disgrace' for not shaking Evra's hand, Suarez, 25, issued an apology on Liverpool's website saying he let down 'the manager, the club and what it stands for'. Scroll down for video . Tension: Uruguayan Suarez, left, avoids Evra's handshake offer as the racism row between the two sides refused to die down . Reaction: Evra grabs Suarez's arm after his attempt to shake the striker's hand was refused . Snub: Evra, who had previously stated he would have been willing to shake Suarez's hand, is given the cold shoulder by the Liverpool striker . The apology from Suarez was issued after it emerged that the striker had told club officials he would shake Evra's hand before the game, only to go back on his word just before kick-off. Liverpool's Managing Director Ian Ayre said today that Suarez 'had told us beforehand that he would, but then chose not to do so. Mr Ayre's added in his own statement: 'He was wrong to mislead us and wrong not to offer his hand to Patrice Evra. He has not only let himself down, but also Kenny Dalglish, his teammates and the Club. 'It has been made absolutely clear to Luis Suarez that his behaviour was not acceptable. 'Luis Suarez has now apologised for his actions which was the right thing to do. However, all of us have a duty to behave in a responsible manner and we hope that he now understands what is expected of anyone representing Liverpool Football Club.' Later, after United’s ill-tempered 2-1 win, emotions spilled over into violence as the players made their way back to the dressing room. Anger: Sir Alex Ferguson, manager of Manchester United, walks off for half time during the match. He branded Suarez a 'disgrace' Looking as if he intended to confront Suarez, Evra found his path to the Uruguayan blocked by Liverpool defender Martin Skrtel. It was the cue for five minutes of pushing and shoving in a melee in the players’ tunnel involving several members of both teams that eventually had to be broken up by police. Evra had also celebrated the win after the final in enthusiastic fashion with a dejected-looking Suarez metres away. Liverpool sought to draw a line under the issue today when Uruguayan striker issued an apology on the club's official website on Sunday lunchtime. The statement from Suarez said: 'I have spoken with the Manager since the game at Old Trafford and I realise I got things wrong. 'I've not only let him down, but also the Club and what it stands for and I'm sorry. I made a mistake and I regret what happened. 'I should have shaken Patrice Evra's hand before the game and I want to apologise for my actions. 'I would like to put this whole issue behind me and concentrate on playing football.' Evra's teammate Rio Ferdinand, who refused to shake Suarez's hand before kick-off, had his say on his colleague's exuberant celebrations in front of the Liverpool man on the final whistle. Ferdinand, 33, tweeted this morning: 'I'm sure Patrice Evra will feel that his celebrations at the end were maybe a bit much....emotions etc probably got the better of him...' Sir Alex, 70, described Suarez as a ‘disgrace to Liverpool’ and said he should not be allowed to play for the club again. ‘I couldn’t believe it. He could’ve started a riot,’ he added. After the handshake brush-off, Evra, 30, tried to pull Suarez back by grabbing his arm, but the striker shrugged him off. Moving along the line of players, Suarez, 25, then came to the French defender’s team-mate Rio Ferdinand. This time, he appeared happy to proffer his hand. But, clearly angry, Ferdinand kept his arms by his sides. After the match, Sir Alex conceded that Evra’s enthusiastic celebrations in front of Suarez after the final whistle were inappropriate. ‘He shouldn’t have done that,’ he said. After the racism row surrounding Suarez and Evra erupted again yesterday, ministers warned that football must not return to the 'bad old days'. Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt said the failure of Suarez to shake Evra's hand was 'incredibly depressing'. David Cameron is to hold a Downing Street summit to discuss the issue, while football's authorities and players' representatives will take part in a session later this month. Shortly before kick-off, thousands of copies of a Manchester United fanzine were seized by police. The edition of Red Issue included a spoof poster of a Ku Klux Klan hood along with the words ‘LFC’, shorthand for Liverpool Football Club, and ‘Suarez is innocent’. Swoop: Police seized copies of the Red Issue magazine which printed a Luis Suarez-themed KKK mask to incite Liverpool fans . Match commander Chief Superintendent Mark Roberts said the fanzines were seized because ‘we cannot be in a situation where hundreds or thousands of people were displaying offensive images’. He said: 'Shortly before . kick-off at [yesterday's] match between . Manchester United and Liverpool, we were made aware that a Manchester . United supporters' fanzine being sold outside Old Trafford featured a . potentially offensive image. 'Officers . are now seizing the fanzines and in consultation with the Crown . Prosecution Service we will take appropriate action against anyone . either found selling this particular fanzine or provocatively displaying . the image in public.' Nobody from Red Issue was available for comment. In . the match itself, Suarez was incessantly booed by Manchester United . fans in a game which the home side eventually won thanks to a Wayne . Rooney brace. Suarez did manage to score for Liverpool but . could not save his side from defeat. The row prompted a welter of comment on Twitter. Manchester United striker John Cofie, currently on loan to Belgian side Royal Antwerp, said: ‘Now suarez I’d love the oppotunity [sic] to knock his ugly ass teeth out!’ Meanwhile, former England striker Stan Collymore said he had reported someone to the police after being racially abused on Twitter.

"Cooking writer Prue Leith (above) has declared it is time to welcome it back into our kitchens . For years veal has been shunned by restaurants and retailers, cast aside as a cruel and unethical meat. But cooking writer Prue Leith has declared it is time to welcome it back into our kitchens - and claims it is a vital part of sustainable farming. ‘Thank God,’ she wrote yesterday. ‘Veal chops are my best thing and I want to stop feeling bad about that.’ Miss Leith - author of the bestselling Leith’s Cookery Bible - suggested that using young bulls for meat is a way to sustain organic farms. ‘If we want milk, butter and cream, we need to eat the unproductive bull calves,’ she wrote in her Spectator column. Veal meat comes from the male calves of cows bred for dairy, slaughtered when they are a few months old. The meat was rejected by many British consumers in the 1980s, when campaigners revealed they were fed formula milk and kept out of sunlight to keep their meat white and tender. Since then farmers have instead sold the young calves abroad or shot them at birth. They cannot be bred for beef, because adult dairy bulls are felt not to make good meat. But many think that it is time to embrace veal once more. They say that times have changed since the sight of tiny veal crates turned consumers off the pale meat 30 years ago. Veal crates were outlawed in the UK in 1990 and British organic farmers now follow strict welfare guidelines. High-welfare veal - also known as ‘rose’ or ‘pink’ veal - was introduced to the market several years ago, but it has had little success because many still consider all veal to be inhumane. Miss Leith, 74, argues that veal is a way to keep organic farms going. ‘What cheered me is the news that pasture fed meat is good for you,’ she wrote. Miss Leith features in BBC2's Great British Menu with Oliver Peyton and Matthew Fort (right) ‘Yes, it costs a bit more than that pale, tasteless, tough stuff, but according to recent research it is higher in beneficial fats and antioxidants than factory farmed meat. ‘Besides, if we are ever to give up chemical fertilisers, we’ll need animals to fertilise the land: no animals = more artificial fertiliser.’ Young veal bulls are a byproduct of the dairy industry. To keep a dairy cow producing milk, she has to calve regularly. If the calf is a female, it is added to the dairy herd. Some male calves are kept as breeding studs, but if they are not used for meat, there is no use for the remainder. Miss Leith’s intervention last night was met with delight by farmers. A spokesman for the National Farmers Union said: ‘The NFU fully supports any initiative that increases the value of dairy bull calves to the British dairy farmer. ‘Rearing male calves from the dairy herd for either beef or veal in this country makes a lot more sense than exporting them for someone else to add value to them.’ ‘British dairy farmers have long been frustrated by the British consumers’ reluctance to buy welfare-friendly rose-veal so anything that encourages the public to go out and purchase it has to be supported.’ Others insisted that customers can only be sure that British veal is ethical – with imported veal subjected to a far less rigorous standard. Wiener schnitzel, the popular breadcrumb coated cutlet of veal, is a traditional Germanic dish and is extremely popular in Europe . Phil Brooke of Compassion in World Farming said: ‘Calves reared for veal outside Britain are likely to have been exported long distances and reared in barren conditions without bedding. ‘Welfare in the UK is higher - rearing these male dairy calves for veal in the UK prevents them from being shot at birth as they are unwanted by the dairy industry. We ask anyone who eats veal to choose British.’ Peter Melchett, policy director of the Soil Association organic movement, added: ‘We agree veal is a good solution but we would encourage people to eat pink veal - where the calves have been raised humanly on a natural diet.’ ‘If organic farmers can’t use their calves for veal, we encourage them to sell them to someone that can - but they must comply with our transport standard.’ But the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals last night dismissed all veal as unethical. A Peta spokesman said: ‘Calves are forcibly removed from their mothers when they’re only a few days old. ‘The terrified, lonely babies may be purposely fed a diet low in iron so that they become anaemic and their flesh remains pale. ‘By the time they’re sent to be killed, many of these infants are so weak that they can barely walk up the ramp to the abattoir.’ The best-selling author's intervention has been met with delight by farmers . He added: ‘If Prue Leith wants to stop feeling bad about veal chops, then the logical solution would be to stop consuming dairy products. ‘It is the demand for milk that drives the veal industry.’","Veal comes from male cow calves slaughtered at just a few months old .

"David Cameron, who was warned he was isolated in his bid to overturn a £1.7billion bill demanded by the EU . David Cameron was warned last night he was ‘isolated’ in his bid to overturn the £1.7billion bill from Brussels – and that the EU was becoming ‘exasperated’ with his demands. The Prime Minister was told that the issue was simply ‘a British problem’ and that the EU would push to levy its own taxes on European citizens if he insists on refusing to pay the £1.7billion demanded. The EU is demanding the payment – which it wants by December – because the UK economy has performed better than expected over the past few years. In contrast, France is receiving a £790million rebate from the EU as its economy struggles in a vicious downturn. Alexander Graf Lambsdorff, a senior German MEP and a vice-president of the European Parliament, said that if Mr Cameron refused to pay, the Commission could levy additional charges as well as withholding the UK’s historic £3billion-a-year rebate. And in a further blow to Mr Cameron, even Denmark’s prime minister - seen as a supporter of his EU modernisation programmes - poured cold water on Britain’s hopes of reducing its cash demand. Helle Thorning-Schmidt, who is married to Lord Kinnock’s son Stephen, said: ‘I respect that the UK wants to discuss this among ministers, but there are rules that must be kept. ‘Countries must follow the rules as they are.’ There were growing questions for George Osborne’s Treasury yesterday after the EU revealed the department knew about the £1.7billion demand almost a week before Mr Cameron was told. Junior Treasury minister David Gauke was told on 14 October that Britain would have to make a significant contribution, although no sum was discussed. Three day later, UK officials were informed by the EU that the figure would be £1.7billion. However, Mr Osborne was not told until last Tuesday - and Mr Cameron did not find out until Thursday, as he was being driven to a Brussels summit. Danish Prime Minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt, who has poured cold water on Britain's chances of having its cash demanded reduced . It has also emerged that ministers had known for months that a significant recalculation of the UK’s contribution to the EU was on the way. As far back as March, former Treasury minister Nicky Morgan said in a letter that the government was giving ‘high priority’ to addressing the impact of the changes. Mr Osborne is due to raise the EU demand at a meeting with the German finance minister in Berlin today. Mr Lambsdorff, who sits in the same European Parliament grouping as the Liberal Democrats’ sole MEP, said there was no excuse for British politicians not to have known about the fee. George Osborne, pictured, was not told until last Tuesday about the EU  and Mr Cameron did not find out until Thursday . ‘This has been mishandled by the British government,’ he told the BBC’s Daily Politics. ‘We are really a little bit exasperated here in Brussels. ‘This is a British problem. The Treasury could have informed the Prime Minister before he came to Brussels about this thing. ‘It is a British problem that has now transferred to a European one. It’s a British affair that should be resolved in Britain and it should be paid up to the EU’s budget.’ He said paying up was ‘non-negotiatable’ - and told Mr Cameron Britain has no allies. ‘It looks very much as if the UK is alone on this,’ he said. Mr Lambsdorff warned: ‘If you think the system is crazy, the system of financing the European Union, you are opening a Pandora’s box in which the British rebate will come on to the table, in which the creation of an EU tax on all member states will be discussed. Junior Treasury minister David Gauke was told on 14 October that Britain would have to make a significant contribution, although no sum was discussed . ‘I don’t think that British citizens will want to pay an EU tax proper.’ Last night the think tank Open Europe said the British people would never accept a system of EU taxes. ‘While the current system of national contributions is messy and frustrating, any form of direct EU taxation would be a leap in the wrong direction,’ she said. ‘In addition to huge practical questions about how such taxes would function – there is a risk certain countries or economic sectors could be hit disproportionately - they would have no democratic legitimacy. ‘The central problem with the EU budget is that it is overly complex and wasteful; the new Commission and MEPs should work on fundamentally reforming this rather than dreaming up new ways to hit taxpayers.’ Tory backbencher John Redwood said the £1.7billion demand was in itself a ‘massive retrospective bill on the British people’. ‘They’re seriously suggesting that the British parliament passes some kind of super European tax and send a bill to everybody,’ he said. ‘I think they’re absolutely crazy. ‘The UK is paying too much; it cannot afford a retrospective tax, which would be a direct tax on the British people. ‘Because the government would be borrowing, it doesn’t have a pot of money saved for this purpose.’ Denmark is one of the winners from the adjustments to national contributions being imposed by the European Commission, and is in line to receive £253 million.","Prime Minister was told issue with the EU bill was simply a 'British problem'

"Fraudster Ashar Ali Rathore has been paid with taxpayers' money to return to Pakistan . An illegal immigrant and sham marriage . ringleader who left prison early with a huge pay-off has used the money to set . up a new business in his homeland - offering UK passports. Ashar Ali Rathore, 33, came to the UK with . his wife Nadia Qadri, 34, on student visas then faked marriages to two Polish . people to gain residency. The fraudster was jailed for conspiring to . breach immigration law, but was then handed £1,500 of taxpayers' money - on condition of leaving Britain and returning to his native country - as part of a . Government scheme for rehabilitating foreign nationals. He had only served seven months of his . two-year sentence. Today, it emerged Rathore has . used the money to set up Xpress Solutions - a company providing UK passports, visas and driving licences in Kotli, Pakistan, his home country. Among its other services, it also bizarrely offers 'any enquiry related to the laws of cricket'. He is not currently under investigation by the Pakistani authorities. Jonathan Isaby, political director of the . TaxPayers' Alliance, branded the payout a 'sick golden . goodbye'. He said: 'When all of us are having to . tighten our belts and watch every penny, pay-offs for fraudsters like Rathore . at British taxpayers' expense are an utter disgrace. 'Ministers must urgently review the . operation of the Facilitated Returns Scheme to ensure that we are not being . taken for a ride. Rathore's shop, Xpress Solutions, in Kotli, Azad Kashmir, has signs in Urdu saying: 'Immigration Appeals', 'Income Tax', 'Passports & ID Cards', 'Mortgages & Property'...and, bizarrely, 'Any Enquiry Related to the Laws of Cricket' 'At the same time, the British police . should do all they can to assist the local authorities in Azad Kashmir in . establishing the legitimacy of Rathore's new enterprise. 'Taxpayers will be appalled to learn that . £1,500 of their hard-earned money was used to give a convicted prisoner this . sick ""golden goodbye"" prior to his deportation.' Under the Facilitated Returns Scheme, foreign criminals in British jails are being offered £1,500 each in cash if . they agree to go home part of the way through their sentences. When they leave, they receive a cash card loaded with £500. A further £1,000 of British taxpayers’ cash is payable within the first three months of their arrival home. The card is programmed to work in ATM machines around the world. The offer is even available to criminals who have served their entire sentence in Britain – at a cost of £45,000 a year. They will get a cash payment of £750. In . opposition, the Tories said the scheme was ‘simply outrageous’. Dominic . Grieve, then Conservative justice spokesman, said: ‘The lesson is . clear: under Labour, crime pays and the taxpayer foots the bill.’ Now . the Coalition says the scheme will save money, because it is cheaper . than forcibly removing foreign criminals or leaving them in . jail. Once the criminals return home they have to make a claim that they . need cash for rent, private healthcare or help to establish a business . before they can obtain the £1,000. Officials have struggled . for years to deport foreign convicts and more than 11,000 are currently . taking up space in Britain’s packed jails. Rathore and Qadri were jailed last March for their faked relationships with the two Poles. The pair were arrested at their home in . Luton, Bedfordshire, for conspiring to breach immigration law. Police recovered around £16,300 in cash . and bank receipts showing large amounts of money paid into the accounts of . their fake partners, when the couple were arrested. Rathore was deported last July and paid as . part of the UK Border Agency Facilitated Returns Scheme for foreign nationals . as an 'incentive for prisoners to co-operate with returning at the earliest . opportunity'. But he used the payout to set up his new . business in Azad Kashmir, providing UK passports, driving licences and . National Insurance cards to Pakistan nationals. A UK Border Agency spokesman said: 'The . scheme saves the taxpayer the cost of keeping foreign national prisoners in . prison and denies them the opportunity to re-offend. 'It should be noted that, as part of our . investigation that resulted in Rathore's conviction, more than £16,000 in cash . was seized from his address under the Proceeds of Crime Act. This has . subsequently been returned to the public purse. 'Nadia Qadri voluntarily departed so did . not receive any money under the scheme. 'At the British High Commission in . Islamabad, Pakistan, the UKBA subjects all applications for visas to come to . the UK to the same rigorous checks, which include checks against international . watchlists. 'In addition, all visa applicants are required to give their . biometrics (fingerprints). 'Staff receive forgery and detection . training and there are tough penalties for the submission of false documents . and information. 'Anyone doing so will not only have their . visa application refused, but also face a ban of up to ten years on future visa . applications.' A video of the launch of Rathore's new . office, which has been removed from YouTube, shows a poster of UK driving licences, passports of various nationalities and . a UK National Insurance Number card. It also features an England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) logo, which has been used without permission. Rathore's office has signs in Urdu saying: 'Immigration . Appeals', 'Income Tax', 'Passports & ID Cards', 'Mortgages & Property', . 'Registering Power of Attorney', 'Legal Paperwork/Statements', 'National and . International College/University Admissions', 'Any Legal Disputes' and, . bizarrely, 'Any Enquiry Related to the Laws of Cricket'. Having been alerted to the misuse of its logo by Luton On Sunday newspaper, . the ECB said in a statement: 'He does not have our permission to use either the .

'We will investigate whether the logos are being used improperly.'","Ashar Rathore served 7 months of two-year sentence .

"It was supposed to be a picture for a private family album, but a photo of the Thomas family from Pennsylvania ended up being seen by millions of people globally after it was used in marketing campaigns by tens of different companies. The issue might have gone unnoticed were it not for the fact the image was used by a local politician who was running for office and decide to use it in his own campaign. Now the Chester family are aware of the viral leak but are struggling to have the picture  removed from websites around the world. Fame at last? The Thomas family discovered their family photo had been used on websites around the world . Privacy settings: Thomas says she and the photographer never submitted the photo to any website or gave them permission to use the photo . Easy to find: A quick search on imgion.com for 'smiling family' turns up the Thomas' photo . Surprise: Kristen Thomas first learned about the problem when she was made aware that her family's photo was on a David Kessler's campaign ad that was mailed to voters . 'We had photos online and never thought anything like this would happen,' Kristen Thomas told Eyewitness News. It was only when David Kessler, a candidate for state representative in Pennsylvania's 130th district, used the picture, that the issue came to light. Mr Kessler told Mrs Thomas that he obtained the photo from the free stock photo website imgion.com. The part that couldn't be explained was that she and the photographer never submitted the photo to the website nor gave them permission to use the picture. She believes imgion.com stole the 2009 photo from her blog. However, it wasn't just Kessler's campaign that was using the shot of her family and three young children, but tens of other websites on almost every continent. Without realizing it, the Thomas family's photo has become the face of advertisements selling apps, sunscreen, pet tracking devices, holiday cards, infertility drugs, cameras and vacations. MailOnline found more than 30 different websites that contained the family's photograph around the world including Turkey, Brazil, Iran, Portugal, Chile, Slovakia and Romania. 'A lot of the sites are in different languages. I don't know what we're selling!' said MrsThomas. Global reach: The family's photo is on more than 30 websites in countries including Turkey, Brazil, Iran, Portugal, Chile, Slovakia and Romania . Family ties: The Thomas' are wondering how they can have the photo removed from all the websites . Mass appeal: The Thomas family's photo has become the face of advertisements selling a host of products from insurance... ...to family days out and holiday greeting cards . Now that the photo has gone viral there is not a lot the Thomas family can do. Legal experts warn that anyone who uses a photo without the proper rights and permissions from the photo's owner could face legal consequences, especially if used for profit and commercial purposes. However, the threat of legal action may not prove to be much of a deterrent especially to individuals like the Thomas' who don't have the backing of a large organization or legal network. There is little that can be done to prevent others from taking pictures once they appear online without going down a long and costly legal road. The Thomas' may struggle to have each and every one of the pictures that were used of their family taken down. Many have suggested the best way to prevent your photos from being taken without permission is to not put them online in the first place . Finding fault: Mrs Thomas believes imgion.com 'stole' the 2009 photo from her blog and then distributed it . Viral: Thomas says she and the photographer never submitted the photo to a stock photo website or gave any permission to use the photo . Picture this: Some of the sites are in different languages and it's not even clear what they are selling . Happy families: Experts say it is unlikely the family will ever be able to stop their photo being used .","Kristen Thomas believes that her family photo with her husband and three children was stolen from her blog .

"Albert Thorn, 80, is still in shock after being attacked during a road rage incident in Cambridge . A terrified pensioner was beaten with a claw hammer in a road rage attack because he had overtaken a young driver. Albert Thorn, 80, said he is still in shock after the motorist started following him when he passed him at a two-lane junction in Cambridge. Mr Thorn said the man, who was driving a van, pulled in front of his car, forcing him to stop suddenly. He then leapt out and brandished a claw hammer, before screaming and shouting profanities at Mr Thorn. The angry motorist then aimed for Mr Thorn with the weapon, attempting to bring down the hammer on his head in a series of violent blows. The father-of-three, said: 'I have terrible injuries and am still in shock about this. 'I just can't believe what happened and that someone would attack an old man for nothing. I was absolutely terrified.' Luckily, Mr Thorn managed to defend himself by holding up his arms. But he was hit on the arms, hands and legs, where he was left with extensive bruising. He added: 'He went for my head, but I shielded myself with my hands. If he had got my head it could have have been much worse.' The van driver had become irate after both motorists tried to turn right at the same junction. Mr Thorn was behind as the pair took the corner at different angles. The young man then began shouting at Mr Thorn out of his window to 'turn at a junction properly', before slamming on his brakes in front of him. Mr. Thorn - who has been driving since he was 21 and has never had an accident - then overtook him and the van driver chased after him and forced him to stop. Mr Thorn, a retired builder, had to be treated at the scene by paramedics, but he did not want to go to hospital. He is now urging members of the public to come forward with any information. Mr Thorn managed to defend himself from the blows to his head, but suffered deep bruising on hands and arms .

"Outspoken former Ukip MEP Godfrey Bloom has quit the party – claiming it is now too politically correct. Mr Bloom, a former flat mate of Nigel Farage, said he was leaving with a ‘heavy heart’ but had ‘had enough’ after being banned from speaking because of his controversial views. He left with a warning for Ukip’s first elected MP Douglas Carswell that he could be knifed in the back by his new party if he was not careful. Mr Bloom, who represented Yorkshire and the Humber for Ukip in the European Parliament for 10 years, added: ‘Douglas, watch your back.’ Scroll down for video . Former Ukip MEP Godfrey Bloom said Ukip was no longer the libertarian force it once was - and was now just like every other political correct party . Mr Bloom, speaking to broadcaster Iain Dale on LBC, added: ‘Douglas, stick to your sort. You believe in libertarianism – don’t be pushed off. ‘Bear in mind we started in 2009 in Europe with 13 MEPs and we ended up with five, so there are dead UKIP bodies all over the place with knives quivering in their back so make sure it’s not yours.’ The former MEP, who was first elected to Brussels in 2004, said: ‘I was a founding member of Ukip and I’ve been a significant donor. ‘But now I find that instead of being the libertarian party, the party of common sense, I’ve been banned from speaking. ‘So, yes, it’s a very sad day for me. But the party seems to have gone astray.’ He added: ‘Quite what’s going on I couldn’t say, but I’ve had enough. ‘What kind of party are we supposed to be? The while point and the reason we are doing so well is because we were supposed to something different. ‘We seem to be drifting towards the politically correct mainstream like everybody else. ‘I’ve had enough of party politics. I don’t think party politics is for people who tell it like it is.’ Mr Bloom sparked controversy in 2012 after complaining that foreign aid is sent to ‘Bongo Bongo Land’. It came after he sparked accusations of sexism after saying: ‘I just don’t think they clean behind the fridge enough’ - a notorious comment that indirectly led to his downfall . When female Ukip activists declared they were too busy to ‘clean behind the fridge’ Mr Bloom told a fringe meeting at the party’s 2012 conference: ‘The room is full of sluts!’ Douglas Carswell was today sworn in as Ukip's first elected MP after holding his seat of Clacton last week . Ukip leader Nigel Farage (centre) and newly elected Ukip MP Douglas Carswell (right) were joined by their party's candidate Mark Reckless on Rochester High Street, Kent, last week . The remark was meant as a joke but provoked a media storm, particularly as Mr Bloom then hit Mr Crick over the head with a Ukip conference programme outside the fringe event in a row about racism. Furious party leader Nigel Farage said Mr Bloom’s antics had ‘destroyed’ coverage of the party’s annual conference, and he was suspended from the party just two hours after giving his keynote address as Ukip’s defence spokesman. In the past Ukip has delighted in being politically incorrect. But the leadership is trying to adopt a more serious image in the run-up to next year’s general elections.","Bloom said he was leaving with a 'heavy heart' but had 'had enough'

The firm is expected to reveal them alongside a new version of its Mac software called Yosemite, and news iPads next month. The new iPads are set to use a thinner design similar to the iPhone 6 and include a Touch ID fingerprint sensor. Scroll down for video . iThe new iMacs are expected to retain a similar design to the current model (pictured) but include an ultra high definition Retina screen. The iPad is expected to have a 9.7 inch screen, while the new version of the iPad mini will have a 7.9 inch screen, Bloomberg earlier reported, citing people familiar with the matter. The iPads are expected to have a thinner, curved design similar to the new iPhone 6, and a Touch ID fingerprint sensor. Apple is also believed to be working on a larger 'iPad Plus' for release next year with a 12.9inch screen. 'A new line of iMacs with ultra high-resolution Retina Displays is in late testing stages within Apple, according to our sources who have used the future desktop computer,' said 9to5 Mac. 'While the machine will sport a thin profile similar to that of the current design, which was introduced in 2012, it will be packed with new internals such as faster processors and improved WiFi antennas,' it says.

Apple is also believed to be working on a larger 'iPad Plus' for release next year with a 12.9inch screen. The firm will also launch a new version of its Mac software called Yosemite. The first thing that strikes you about Yosemite is that there is less to look at. Gones are the bells and whistles, the fake leather and other distractions of previous versions. Instead, what you have is, without doubt, the best looking operating system ever seen. Apple's obsession with detail is clear, and when combined with high high resolution retina display of the firm's latest laptops, the difference is incredibly obvious. Even the tiny details, such as a new font Apple designed, give everything a crisp, uncluttered feel. Menus also now have a transparent feel, giving the system an almost glass-like feel as you move windows around. Although iOS 8 is not yet available so we were unable to try out the call and 'handoff' features, the new notification centre on screen gives a real sense that the iPhone, iPad and Mac are now one system, system than three separate gadgets. The Yosemite software will allow users to make and receive calls and notifications from their Mac - even if their iPhone is in another room. Notifications can carry over from your iPhone, and the 'today' view mimics that iPhone users are used to. Also surprisingly useful are the upgrades to Spotlight, the Mac's search system. Searching now shows you information from Wikipedia pages, and you can even search the web without having to open a seperate browser window - although it does Bing rather than Google. you can also do basic sums, and even currency conversions form the spotlight window, and even show you cinema times if you search for a film - a real timesaver. The mail app has also been updated, with a new 'markup' feature that lets you easily draw on images - which is great fun to play with. Surprisingly for what is still a test piece of software, Yosemite also feels incredibly fast and snappy. As well as being the best looking OS we've ever seen, Yosemite really does give a glimpse into the future of Apple, where all your devices work together seamlessly - as long at they are made by Apple.

"Dundee United have vowed to take on the SFA after midfielder Paul Paton was handed a two-match ban for spitting on Jonny Hayes – despite the Aberdeen winger insisting the incident did not happen.

'The player will certainly be appealing this decision and will be given our full backing in this matter. 'The decision today relating to Paul Paton is incredulous.

Last night the SFA confirmed to Sportsmail there is no right of appeal meaning Paton is banned for Sunday’s home match against champions Celtic and the following week’s visit to St Johnstone. ‘We are of the opinion that the wording of the current rules allows us to challenge a fundamentally flawed decision – like this undoubtedly is,’ a defiant United spokesman insisted. ‘We will contest this ban as hard as we can.’ United had believed their written submission to the SFA - containing blown-up footage of the alleged incident - in addition to Hayes’ strong denial on Twitter that any spitting occurred, would see their player exonerated. After Paton was handed the two-game ban, however, a furious United went on the offensive. ‘The player will certainly be appealing this decision and will be given our full backing in this matter,’ a club statement said. ‘The decision relating to Paul Paton is incredulous. We are stunned firstly that it was brought in front of the Judicial Panel by the new Compliance Officer and secondly that the Judicial Panel have found the player guilty of something that we do not believe to have taken place. ‘It is truly mystifying that three people in a room at Hampden Park in Glasgow on a Thursday afternoon can see something that was not seen by the referee, first assistant, second assistant, fourth official, SPFL delegate, the managers of either team, the players of either team including the alleged villain and victim not to mention the 11,168 supporters in the stadium. ‘As part of our original defence submission we studied enlarged video footage to ensure our player was not guilty of such an offence. We were sound in our belief that no such action had taken place and we will continue to support the player in this matter through the appeal process.’ Paton was found guilty by a Scottish FA disciplinary panel on Thursday after being accused of spitting . Hayes (left) says Paton (right, on the floor) never spat at him during the Scottish Premiership match . AfterThursday’s verdict, an angry Paton took to Twitter to vent his own bemusement at being found guilty. He tweeted: ‘I honestly have no words?! Can’t say too much, just wow’ while Dons winger Hayes merely posted an ‘embarrassed’ face on his own Twitter page. Speaking on Radio Scotland on Thursday night, Aberdeen manager Derek McInnes said there has been no complaint from Aberdeen regarding the incident and backed his player for the ‘honourable’ stance of taking to Twitter in an attempt to clear Paton. The incident in question happened during the second half of Saturday’s 2-0 victory for Aberdeen at Tannadice. After catching Hayes from behind, Paton stood over his fallen opponent, who jumped up furiously to remonstrate with the United midfielder. No action was taken at the time by referee Crawford Allan but after reviewing footage, a notice of complaint was issued by McGlennan. That prompted Hayes to take to Twitter earlier this week to defend his opponent, saying: ‘Just wanna clear it up that Paul Paton never spat at me, what happens and is said on the pitch is brushed aside at the end of 90mins! What happened on Saturday will stay between myself and Paul, we’ve spoke on this non issue, and if asked I’ll confirm what happened. ‘To the Scottish FA, I’d never want to see a fellow pro being accused or found guilty of something that never happened!’ A spokesman for Aberdeen said Hayes remained adamant the incident had not happened but the Pittodrie club declined to comment further.

Many residents were too upset to comment while others struggled to hold back tears. One woman, who did not wish to be named, said: 'I used to see Alan all the time. 'He'd always say 'hello' and was very friendly. This is terrible news.' Yellow ribbons were tied to lampposts, houses and cars in the street in support for Mr Henning's family.

A yellow ribbon for murdered British hostage Alan Henning is tied to a taxi seen in the town centre of Eccles today . Alan lived with his wife Barbara and their two children. Last week Mrs Henning had made a desperate appeal to his captors to spare his life, pleading with them to show 'mercy' and 'clemency'. But the plea fell on deaf ears as ISIS released its latest video on Friday showing Mr Henning being beheaded by the fighter who's become known as Jihadi John. Mr Henning, 47, was kidnapped by extremists while delivering aid in Syria in December. Fellow aid worker Majid Freeman, from Leicester, who was with him when was seized, told BBC Radio 4's Today this morning: 'He was an everyday man like you or me. He's seen the massacres and innocents being oppressed. ISIS released a video on Friday apparently showing Mr Henning being beheaded by the fighter who's become known as Jihadi John . Mr Henning's local MP Barbara Keeley said the death would be a 'devastating loss' for his family . 'He didn't look at religion, he saw them as human beings and he wanted to make a difference. He was helping widows, orphaned children, people the international community had abandoned.' Kasim Jameel, from Bolton, who was with Mr Henning on the convoys and first interested him in helping the people of Syria, said today: 'I'm totally heartbroken. What can you say? When you lose someone so important to you, you can't put it into words. 'Everyone that knew him from the convoys just can't stop crying, grown men with beards. We keep expecting him to come round the corner, and say, ""I was only joking"". Alan Henning's wife Barbara (pictured) had made a desperate appeal to his captors to spare his life, pleading with them to show 'mercy' and 'clemency' 'He is the best of the best, a pure soul, he is in the best paradise. It's time for him to rest, he's done a lot of work, God's called an angel back.' This afternoon Imam Asim Hussain from the Manchester Central Mosque described the killers as an 'Insult to the Islamic faith'. Last night Mr Henning's local MP Baraba Keening told Manchester Evening News: 'Everyone takes great pride in him and what he was doing.' And the Rt Revd Dr David Walker, Bishop of Manchester, is reported as saying this morning: 'In his life Alan Henning united people across the boundaries of nationality and faith. He did so both through his humanitarian actions and by the love that drove him on. 'That his tragic death continues to unite people across Britain and beyond is demonstrated today by the range of people and organisations paying him tribute. 'To ISIS we say: You no longer have the power to shock us, now you just sicken us. Your brutality, against any who don't share your narrow, perverted worldview, doesn't undermine our determination, it stiffens our resolve.' Greater Manchester’s Police and Crime Commissioner Tony Lloyd (pictured) said people across the area would be 'shocked' at the murder . In a statement released today, Greater Manchester’s Police and Crime Commissioner Tony Lloyd said people across the area would be 'shocked' at the murder. 'Our thoughts are with his family and circle of loved ones at this terrible time,' he said. 'What they are going through is unimaginable. All we can do is express our sympathy and pledge to remember Alan for what he was – a thoroughly decent man and the kind of quiet humanitarian who makes this world a better place. 'This is murder, plain and simple. That it could be claimed to be in the name of religion is obscene and all people of faith will abhor this brutal act of cowardice. 'Alan Henning will not be forgotten – he made a difference to people’s lives and while the world is a little darker today, his commitment to the cause of humanity will last longer and burn brighter than the supposed cause of the evil men who took his life.' The former taxi driver had worked for New Lyle Cars, in Eccles, but a radio operator at the company said no-one was available to comment. Martyn Shedwick, a friend who helped repair one of the donated ambulances driven in the convoy to Syria, told the Manchester Evening News: 'He's quite an amazing guy for what he's done. An ordinary bloke, just wanting to help out, that's all it is. 'He never talked about politics or religion or anything. British Imams and Muslim faith leaders have expressed their outrage at the 'senseless' murder of taxi driver Alan Henning by 'barbarian' terrorists. Leading British Muslim leaders called for special remembrance prayers to take place this weekend in Mr Henning’s honour. Shaukat Warraich, editor of Imamsonline.com and chief executive of Faith Associates, said: 'The Muslim community is devastated at the news that the humanitarian worker has been murdered by these barbarians. 'He was a friend of the Muslim community, Syrian and Iraqi people. His senseless murder proves that ISIS is beyond the pale and doesn’t listen to reason. 'The fact that they have chosen to do this at the time of Eid as millions of Muslims are joining together in prayer as a celebration of unity only goes to show their complete evil and barbarity. 'Our thoughts and prayers are with the family of Alan Henning at this most difficult time.' Faith Associates works with some of the 1,700 mosques across the country and was recently behind an open letter signed by more than 100 Imams condemning ISIS and urging British Muslims not to travel to Syria. Shaukat Warraich (pictured), editor of Imamsonline.com and chief executive of Faith Associates, said the Muslim community was 'devastated' at news Alan Henning had been killed . They are now urging Imams to use sermons during Eid prayers to ask their congregations to make a special prayer for the family of Alan Henning. Muslim faith leaders across Britain have also expressed their outrage at the murder in a video released yesterday. In a series of hard-hitting and emotional statements, the short video features five leading Muslim voices expressing their horror and condemning ISIS. Speaking in the 1:46mins video, Imam Ghulam Rasool, Principle of Birmingham’s Sultan Bahu Trust, says: 'Regarding this unfortunate, despicable video released by ISIS which brutally, callously and cold-heartedly murders an innocent humanitarian aid worker – just for public show, just for them to express their power – it’s a complete abomination. 'It’s condemned unreservedly by the British Muslim community and rightly so. This act is a criminal act and a gross act of terrorism and evil.' Ustadh Ashfaq Sadiq, Secretary of the Barking Masjid, added: 'The majority of Muslims are peace-loving people. This minority appear to have grabbed and hijacked the religion, for their own ends. 'You’re not doing this in my name, you’re not doing it in the name of my Islam. Your Islam I don’t recognize. It’s not Islam, I don’t recognize you as a Muslim.' Denouncing the murder, Zafar Iqbal, Chairman of Wycombe Islamic Mission, said: 'We don’t believe that a Muslim can do this sort of evil act. We condemn that, we always condemn this sort of activity. This is not Islamic.' Jama Egal, Manager of the Quba Centre in Leicester, added: 'They’re completely wrong. They don’t know the meaning of the Quran, they don’t know the way of the Quran.' And Dr Musharraf Hussain, Imam of Masjir As-Shifa in Nottingham, said: 'This group of course is a criminal group. 'A gang which has no space, no place in the Muslim community. Neither does the British Muslim community have any kind of sympathy for such evil acts and brutal activities ISIS.' 'Despite all the badness in the world, there's some really good people as well and Alan is one of them - he just really wanted to help.' Tony McNeil, from the Bolton Interfaith Council, who helped organise a vigil for Mr Henning, said: 'My first reaction was shock and outrage really. 'We've been in suspended animation and limbo ever since all this business started. 'I must admit I didn't honestly believe they would take his life. 'I thought there would be some type of leadership in that group who would say to take Alan's life would be a step too far.' 'Our thought are with the family and the community and all of Alan's Muslim's friends as well - this has put a great smear on the whole religion, which is a sad thing as well.'","Video claiming to show the beheading of Alan Henning was posted online .

"Qatar has been paying migrant workers to attend events in a bid to present itself as a nation of sports fans. The controversial hosts of the 2022 World Cup pay thousands of fake fans little more than 60p an hour, said a report published on Wednesday. An Associated Press journalist managed to board one of the buses, witnessing men ‘grappling with each other’ to earn some extra money. ‘These weren’t refugees fleeing disaster,’ said the report. ‘They were migrant workers fighting to earn a few dollars.’ A man whips up a crowd which included migrant workers from Africa and Asia who said they were paid to attend the Qatar Open of international beach volleyball . Migrant workers clamber aboard a bus that carried them to the  volleyball event . Workers attend football, volleyball and handball events dressed in white robes and headscarves in order to look like Qatari supporters. The reporter travelled on one of three buses that took around 150 workers to the Qatar Open beach volleyball event last month. The FIVB, volleyball’s governing body, celebrated the fact that the World Tour event had ‘brought out the crowds’. But the migrant workers from Ghana, Kenya, Nepal and beyond told the AP reporter they were there only because they were being paid. FIVB media director Richard Baker said he will ‘seek clarification’ from the Qatari organisers. The migrant workers make their way to the event packed on to a bus . Athletes compete at Qatar Open of international beach volleyball in front of crowds including migrant workers . The buses were over-crowded, with no air conditioning or safety belts, and the fake fans had to wait three hours after the event before being transported back. FIFA issued a March deadline for labour reforms after reports of human rights violations among migrants employed to work on World Cup venues. Failure to meet the deadline could see Qatar risk losing the 2022 finals.","Migrant workers are paid little more than 60p per hour to be fake fans .

"An enraged Muslim mob beat a Christian couple to death in Pakistan and burnt their bodies in a brick kiln where they worked on Tuesday for allegedly desecrating a Koran, police said. The incident took place at the town of Kot Radha Kishan, some 40 miles southwest of the city of Lahore, and is the latest example of mob violence against minorities accused of blasphemy. A police officials told AFP: 'A mob attacked a Christian couple after accusing them of desecration of the holy Koran and later burnt their bodies at a brick kiln where they worked. Pakistani security officials have been placed on high alert since the married couple were killed near Lahore . A mob accused the couple of desecrating a copy of the Koran who then beat them and threw them into a kiln . The Christian couple were attacked in the town which is just 50 miles from Lahore and thrown into a kiln . 'Yesterday an incident of desecration of the holy Koran took place in the area and today the mob first beat the couple and later set their bodies on fire at a brick kiln,' he added. Another police official confirmed the incident. The victims were only identified by their first names, Shama and Shehzad, and were a married couple. Pakistan's brick kiln workers are often subject to harsh practices, with a study by the Bonded Labour Liberation Front Pakistan estimating that 4.5 million are indentured labourers. Punjab Chief Minister Shahbaz Sharif has constituted a three-member committee to fast track the investigation of the killings and ordered police to beef up security at Christian neighbourhoods in the province. Mohammad Asghar, left, from Glasgow, was shot last month in a Pakistani prison while he waited for his execution for blasphemy, his daughter Jasmine Rana, right, wants an investigation into her father's case . Blasphemy is a hugely sensitive issue in the majority Muslim country, with even unproven allegations often prompting mob violence. Anyone convicted, or even just accused, of insulting Islam, risks a violent and bloody death at the hands of vigilantes. A Christian woman has been on death row since November 2010 after she was found guilty of making derogatory remarks about the Prophet Mohammed during an argument with a Muslim woman. An elderly British man with severe mental illness, Mohammad Asghar, who was sentenced to death for blasphemy in Pakistan in January, was shot by a prison guard last month.","Killing latest example of mob violence against minorities in Muslim Pakistan .

The stylish teen added: 'It's not like I'm doing anything bad, but he went through all that with Nicole, so he's just strict to prevent it from happening again.' And so far, so good. While Nicole, now 33, had already been arrested for drug possession and gone through a stint in rehab by the time she hit 22, Sofia seems to be far too occupied with her many ambitions. 'I want to do design, fashion, and music,' she says. 'Singing has always been the biggest passion for me. It runs in my family!' Of course these days, Nicole - who has two children with her Good Charlotte rocker husband Joel Madden - has left her rebellious ways behind, and she's eager to help Sofia avoid the mistakes she once made.

"A new study has found that drivers are speeding through inactive roadwork sites, despite high crashing and fatality rates in these areas. Dr Ross Blackman, a road safety researcher, surveyed more than 400 people who were asked to estimate their speed for a range of different roadwork site scenarios. 'It's seen as crying wolf. If people are asked to slow down at roadwork sites but find there is no roadwork being undertaken they become de-sensitised to the signage and ignore speed limits,' he said. Dr Ross Blackman (above), a road safety researcher, surveyed more than 400 people in his study on speeding around inactive roadwork sites . The study revealed the majority of drivers exceeded the speed limits at roadwork sites, despite these areas having high crash and fatality rates . 'In 2013, our research found that at three Queensland rural roadwork sites, the majority of vehicles observed exceeded the posted speed limits by at least 5km/h,' he said. 'We found when a road worker and machinery were visible, drivers nominated lower speeds, suggesting that they were far more likely to slow down than if they saw no activity.' 'There was about a 20 per cent reduction in speed between an inactive roadwork site (53km/h) compared to an active site with workers visible (42km/h).' Dr Blackman said despite reduced speed limits, crash rates and crash severity around roadwork sites were high because drivers failed to slow sufficiently and were often not paying attention. 'Roadwork sites have high crash rates and there have been numerous fatalities at roadwork sites in Queensland involving workers and public road users,' he said. Dr Blackman said the study reinforced moves by the Queensland Government to review speed limit signage around roadwork sites, but cautioned that hazards may also remain outside of work hours, requiring reduced speed limits around the clock at some sites. The study found that road workers on site had the biggest impact on drivers to reduce speed . 'There are no simple solutions, but multiple measures used in combination may be most effective. With technology, for example, variable speed limit signs can be easily changed without the need for workers to physically move or replace traditional static signage,' he said. 'There are also feedback speed displays which record and display how fast a vehicle is travelling, which drivers respond to well. 'Our survey showed road workers on site had the biggest impact on drivers to reduce speed, while the most effective specific measure was having police visually present and potentially conducting enforcement,' he said. 'If we can combine the effective measures, then we are more likely to see drivers reduce their speed, which will improve safety for both drivers and workers.' The results of the study have been presented at the Occupational Safety in Transport Conference,which brings together experts from all facets of transport safety including roads, rail, fleets, and mining to improve workplace safety.","Study from Queensland surveyed 400 drivers about driving speeds in roadwork sites .

"An unsettling video of toddler being encouraged to smoke has incited an uproar on the Internet. Wide-eyed and padded with puppy fat, the youngster, who can be no older than two, nervously holds the lit cigarette as adults out of shot whisper encouragement. A couple of times he tries to give it back, but they will not take it. Then they are perversely effusive in their exhortations as he puts it to his lips, although he appears not to inhale. Shocking: This toddler stands wide-eyed and innocent as he's encouraged to smoke a cigarette . Perverse: Although he has no idea what to do with the cigarette, the adults looking after him egg him on . Unsettling: Their cries of encouragement increase in intensity as he brings the lit cigarette to his lips . The footage was uploaded to the LiveLeak video-sharing website by a user from Macedonia. Its origins are unknown, but it is believed to have been filmed in eastern Europe or Russia. Throughout the two-minute-long clip the adults looking after the boy, as well as at least one older child, can be heard cackling at the toddler's confusion. It has been shot in a run-down living room, devoid of distinguishing features. Despite the youngster not knowing what to do with the burning cigarette, and his repeated attempts to give it back, they insist he hang on to it until it has nearly burned down to his fingers. Baby see baby do: The young boy makes a face as he mimics the actions he's seen older people repeat . Innocent: He tries to return the cigarette but is encouraged to hold on to it despite his unwillingness . Persistence: He flicks the ash into the ashtray. He's forced to keep it until it's burned nearly to his fingers . Commenters on LiveLeak, where they didn't try to make quips, were condemnatory: 'This is just too disgusting to watch,' wrote one upset viewer. 'An innocent kid who does not know any better, and can only imitate and follow instruction from the people he trusts most ... humanity has failed again.. Another opined: 'Some f***** up people in this world. You need a license to own a dog but any pr*** can have kids.

But the couple eventually succumbed to their emotions and started dating after Flavia dumped Vincent. Matt later said: 'It was front page news. The funny thing was the story did not start off as true, but the more you read it, the more you started to believe it and actually act on it.

'We can chat forever to each other and never run out of things to say.' Flavia Cacace and Jimi Mistry are one of the few success stories - they got married last year . Ali Bastian and Brian Fortuna: . In 2009, actress Ali Bastian was partnered with American dancer Brian Fortuna and they went on to win third place in that year's competition. The couple started dating while still on the show and after it finished they went on to perform in a West End show called Burn The Floor together. Sadly, the romance fizzled out away from the dance floor and they split a year later. Ali Bastian and Brian Fortuna dated for a year after meeting on the show in 2009 . Joe Calzaghe and Kristina Rihanoff: . 2009 was also the year that Joe Calzaghe signed up for the dance competition, where he was partnered with Kristina Rihanoff. Joe dumped his girlfriend Jo-Emma Larvin and started dating Kristina, with the couple moving in together after just a year. The relationship didn't last though and the couple split last year, with Kristina blaming her busy work schedule. Joe Calzaghe and Kristina Rihanoff had a good run of it, but the couple eventually split after four years together in 2013 . Ricky Whittle and Natalie Lowe: . 2009 was a bumper year for celebrity-dancer relationships on Strictly, as Ricky Whittle also rumoured to have had a romance with his partner Natalie Lowe. The chemistry was enough for Ricky to take the plunge and dump his two-year girlfriend and fellow Hollyoaks actor Carley Stenson. Any chemistry between Natalie and Ricky was short-lived though, with Ricky most recently dating Bruce Willis and Demi Moore's daughter Rumer. Ricky Whittle and Natalie Lowe had huge chemistry when they partnered in the 2009 show . Rachel Riley and Pasha Kovalev: . Last year, Countdown's Rachel Riley was the surprise victim of the Strictly curse after she fell for the charms of her dance partner Pasha Kovalev. She split with her husband of 15 months and childhood sweetheart Jamie Gilbert just one month after appearing on the show. Rachel and Pasha then started dating earlier this year and are so far still together. Rachel Riley left her husband after performing on Strictly last year, in the summer she began dating her dance partner Pasha Kovalev .","Kara and Artem started dating after she appeared on show in 2010 .

"Britain's green and pleasant lands have been transformed to scorched earth as the country records the driest September since records began in 1910. This month is also likely to finish in the top five warmest, with UK mean temperatures significantly above the monthly average and today reaching a summery 23C in some areas. According to figures released today, this September was even warmer than August across parts of the UK. The Central England Temperature of 15.3C was 1.2C above the mean for 1981-2010, making the month - rarely - warmer than August, said weather historian Philip Eden. It was the warmest September since 2006, and in the last 100 years only three were warmer, two had the same mean temperature, while 95 were cooler. Parts of the River Wharfe in North Yorkshire have completely dried up due to lack of rainfall, leaving a rocky scar across the arid countryside. And Hollowell Reservoir, in Northamptonshire, is running at just 50 per cent of its normal level, reduced to little more than a trickle of its former glory. According to Met Office figures some areas of the UK have had less than 20mm of rainfall for the whole of September, just 20 per cent of the normal amount of rainfall for the month. But forecasters warn 'change is afoot' with a much wetter and windier picture for the beginning of October, although it is likely to remain warmer than normal. Scroll down for video . Parts of the River Wharfe in North Yorkshire have completely dried up due to lack of rainfall, leaving a rocky scar across the arid countryside as the country records the driest September since records began in 1910 . The river at Yockenthwaite usually flows through a lush green landscape.  According to Met Office figures some areas of the UK have had less than 20mm of rainfall for the whole of September . Although it looks like the sheep are grazing on meadows, it is actually the Hollowell Reservoir bed. The reservoir in Northamptonshire is extremely low, around 50 per cent of its normal level . The reservoir as it usually appears, surrounded by greenery and with lakes of water. But forecasters warn 'change is afoot' with a much wetter and windier picture for the beginning of October . It will start to feel cooler with the mercury dropping to single figures in the north and low double figures elsewhere overnight on Wednesday, they say. Met Office spokeswoman Nicky Maxey said an area of low pressure moving over the UK will trigger a change in the weather from Thursday. She said: 'We have got a change in the weather coming up, until now we have had high pressure bringing settled conditions but low pressure is about to dominate towards the weekend. 'It is going to start on Thursday with gales and heavy rain in the northwest and Scotland, then on Friday and Saturday it will move southwards bringing more unsettled conditions. 'Temperatures will also move closer to normal for the time of year and it seems the unsettled weather will continue through much of October.' September follows on from the 8th wettest August on record and the wettest winter on record at the start of the year which saw large swathes of Somerset under floodwater. Using figures from September 1-28, the UK as a whole has received 19.4mm of rain, just 20 per cent of the normal amount of rainfall which would be expected for the month. Before this one, the driest September on record was 1959 with 23.8mm. Northamptonshire has only had 58 per cent average rainfall from January to the end of September, making it the driest first ten months of the year since 1929 . England, Wales and Scotland are likely to have their second driest September on record, with 13.5mm, 11.9mm and 33.3mm of rain respectively . Looking at individual countries, Northern Ireland should break the record for September dryness with only 6.5mm of rain, just 7 per cent of the average. The previous record was set in 1986, with 9.7mm. England, Wales and Scotland are likely to have their second driest September on record, with 13.5mm, 11.9mm and 33.3mm of rain respectively. Records were set in 1959 (7.9mm), 1959 (11.7mm) and 1972 (31.7mm) respectively. This September follows on from the eighth wettest August on record and comes in a generally very wet year - this January to August is the wettest such period in the records, mainly as a result of the very wet start to the year and the wettest winter on record. This means water levels remain sufficient. Trevor Bishop, Environment Agency deputy director of water resources, said: 'Following the wettest January to August on record, water resources in England are around normal for the time of year. 'We also look ahead by modelling how rivers and groundwater may respond to different future rainfall patterns. The results show a broadly positive picture and even if rainfall is below average this autumn the country will not go into drought.' A bridge spans across the River Wharfe in North Yorkshire where stretches of the river have dried up leaving a rocky scar in the Yorkshire Dales, following the driest September on record . It means walkers can now simply cross the river bed on foot in North Yorkshire which has been reduced to little more than a road of mud and rocks . The mean temperature for the UK so far has been 13.9C, which is 1.2C above the long-term average. This means it has been the joint fourth warmest September in the records back to 1910, but is well below the record of 15.2C set in 2006. Sunshine amounts have been closer to average, with 94 per cent of what would normally be expected across the UK. The dry and warm conditions have been caused by high pressure dominating the weather for much of the month. This tends to block more unsettled weather heading in off the Atlantic, leaving the UK fine, dry and fairly sunny. Leon Brown, forecaster for The Weather Channel UK, said parts of the UK could see more than 50mm (2 inches) of rain fall on Friday night. He said: 'A big pattern change as much wetter weather is on its way to the UK. Get brollies and coats ready. Elsewhere today, people made the most of the hot weather during lunch time in Castle Park, Bristol, as temperatures remain high for the end of September . Sunbathers soak up the last of the rays in Castle Park, Bristol. The dry and warm conditions have been caused by high pressure dominating the weather for much of the month . The heat looked to be too much for some, as one sunbather shades himself with a hat as he sleeps in Castle Park, Bristol . 'The weather will feel very autumnal by the weekend and next week as low pressure takes control of our weather. 'An active cold front will edge southwards on Friday and Saturday, and is likely to bring some high rainfall totals to Scotland, Ireland, northwest England and northwest Wales. '25 to more than 50mm is possible on Friday night to early Saturday with the highest totals Cumbria and southern Scotland. 'The weather then becoming a lot cooler by the weekend and very unsettled next week with more widespread rain. 'Latest forecasts suggest the UK will receive 150-200 per cent of normal precipitation next week, and often windy too.' A Coot swims across a pond covered in algae in Regent's Park today. Algae has been far more widespread this year in many ponds and canals because of higher than average temperatures and low rainfall leading to less oxygenated water . A couple feed squirrels in Regent's Park. The country is set for the driest September since records began in 1910, with extremely low rainfall for many parts of the country, the Met Office has reported . Regent's Park was bathed in balmy conditions throughout today. The Met Office's three-month contingency planner states temperatures are likely to remain above average during October, November and December . James Madden, forecaster for Exacta Weather said: 'As we progress throughout this weekend and into next week a major change is set to take place to a more autumnal type weather pattern. 'Low pressure will become a widespread and more dominant feature and this will result in some markedly cooler temperatures across many parts of the country. 'It will also become rather unsettled and stormy with periods of rain for many parts of the country, which will also be accompanied by some very strong to gale force winds, in particular, in parts of the north.' However the good news is there is no sign of a big freeze this winter with generally warmer than normal conditions expected until the end of the year. The Met Office's three-month contingency planner states temperatures are likely to remain above average during October, November and December. It states: 'The latest predictions for UK-mean temperature favour above-average temperatures for both October and October-November-December as a whole. 'Overall, the probability that the UK-mean temperature for October-November-December will fall into the warmest of our five categories is around 35 pert cent and the probability of falling into the coldest of our five categories is close to 10 per cent.'","According to Met Office figures some areas of the UK have had less than 20mm of rainfall for the whole of September .
The figure is just 20 per cent of the normal amount of rainfall which would be expected for the month .
This month's dry spell means river beds have dried up and some reservoirs low – but experts say there was enough rain throughout the rest of the year so it is not officially a drought .
Parts of the country enjoyed highs of 23C on the last day of the hottest September for more than 100 years .
According to figures released today, this September was even warmer than August across parts of the UK .
But forecasters warn 'change is afoot' with a much wetter and windier picture for the beginning of October ."
"A mother-of-two has transformed herself into a super svelte mum with the help of Facebook. Kelly Cairns, 34, from Ryhope, Sunderland, had never struggled with her weight until she gave birth to her two sons and suffered from post-natal depression, which caused her weight to balloon to 14st 7lb and a size 18. Worried what the other school children would say to her sons, Kelly, now a size 12, decided to do something about her weight. Turning to food as comfort during bouts of post natal depression caused Kelly's weight to reach 14st 7lb . Kelly has lost over 3st after gaining support through a Facebook group, and intends to lose another 10lb . She started a Facebook page for recipes, diary entries and photos, and with the support of her followers has lost over three stone - with more to go. Kelly, who runs a business from home and now weighs 11st 7lb, said: 'I started losing the weight with a slimming club, but when it plateaued I needed something to help me with the last push. 'I started the Yummy Mummy Weight Loss Plan on Facebook in August this year to help me lose the final 10lb before November. Kelly, pictured as a size 18,  says her bad eating habits continued as her sons grew up, causing her weight to keep rising . Kelly credits the support she has received and shared online with her continued weight loss success . 'In the first weekend I got over 400 likes on the page - I couldn't believe it.' Kelly first started piling on the pounds after the birth of her two sons - Rhys, nine, and Evan, seven. She suffered with post-natal depression and turned to food as a comfort. Kelly said: 'As the boys got older, I was stuck in bad habits and the weight continued to go on. 'I would worry what the other kids would say to Rhys and Evan at school in the playground. 'The final straw for me was when I saw a picture of myself from the side and I looked huge. Kelly decided to start the Yummy Mummy Facebook page to document her progress and help her to get over the final hurdle and lose those last few pounds . 'I had moved from Wales to Sunderland and didn't really have many friends, so stepping through the doors to the Slimming World group was a huge deal.' Breakfast: White toast or cereal . Lunch: Sandwich from Greggs . Dinner: Takeaway or something from a jar . Snacks: Biscuits and crisps . Breakfast: Fruit smoothie . Lunch: Leftovers from last night or soup . Dinner: Pasta with homemade sauce or chili . Snacks: Fruit . Kelly lost the majority of her weight thanks to the group, but after leaving she missed the moral support and her weight loss slowed down. Kelly began losing weight as she feared sons Rhys (l) and Evan (r) would be bullied over her size . During this time Kelly also started weight training. Although it helped tone her body, she lost motivation as her muscle gain also meant she put on weight. She decided to start the Yummy Mummy Facebook page to document her progress and help her to get over the final hurdle and lose those last few pounds. She said: 'Putting pictures online helped me see how far I've come and if I'm having a fat day then the encouragement of others helps keep me going. 'I started putting recipes up to show other mums that eating healthily doesn't have to cost a fortune. 'I never thought it would be this popular, but it's a real confidence boost. 'Now I just need to lose the final 10lbs. I'm hoping to do it by the end of November.'","Kelly suffered post natal depression after the birth of her two sons .

"Forget tricks, it was all about the fashion treats on this weekend's X Factor. Fleur East, without a doubt, stole the show thanks to her incredible interpretation of Michael Jackson's Thriller - Louis Walsh even described it as the most amazing performance he's ever seen on the show. Gemma Sheppard, the X Factor stylist and the brains behind the carefully calculated outfit, shared the secrets behind Fleur's incredible look with FEMAIL - and, as we reveal in these exclusive behind the scenes images, it was a lot more complicated to pull off than it looked. Scroll down for video . Dramatic change: Fleur East wowed the audience and judges with her performance of Thriller on the show and ripped off her couture gown to reveal a latex flesh dress . 'We actually started the creation of Fleur's outfit last Sunday night, straight after the live shows,' Gemma told us. While it looked spectacular on stage on Saturday night's show, the design process wasn't so glamorous. Fleur had to be wrapped in cling film and tape so that Central St Martin's graduate Jack Irving could drip her in latex to start the creation of the 'flesh' dress that would be her thriller transformation. Getting ready: Fleur's flesh dress was designed by a university graduate and took hours to complete, left. In the week, Fleur visited Suzanne's boutique on Beauchamp Place, Knightsbridge for a fitting, right . Complicated process: Fleur had to be wrapped in cling film and tape so that Central St Martin's graduate Jack Irving could drip her in latex to start the creation of the 'flesh' dress that would be her thriller transformation . Speaking about the inspiration behind the look, Gemma explained: 'Like the original video, we wanted ‎to create the gruesome change, so she opened the song in a bespoke Suzanne Neville gown.' In the week - in between public appearances and singing rehearsals - Fleur visited Suzanne's boutique on Beauchamp Place, Knightsbridge for a fitting. The result? An elegantly crafted silk chiffon gown that fit like a glove. 'Just as MJ looks like the perfect preppy teenager in the original video, I wanted Fleur to look a vision in exquisite couture, explained Gemma. Meanwhile, Jack Irving was working on the latex dress, which he painted with acrylics and decorated with beadwork and Swarovski crystals. Beauty buff: To ensure the singers' skin looks flawless on TV, under the harsh lighting, Julia explains how she and her team focus on concealing and use lots of light reflecting products to leave the skin looking youthful and radiant - just like Parisa's . The Suzanne Neville gown, worn over the top of the flesh dress, was held together with velcro so it was easy for the big reveal on stage - and it certainly didn't disappoint the judges. Fleur, too, said that it was her 'favourite performance ever' and no doubt her dramatic costume helped. 'Fleur is embracing every element of the X Factor journey,' added Gemma. 'Thriller was a huge act for her to take on and I wanted to support her with two incredible looks.' As well as killer outfits, the contestants need dewy, HD-ready makeup. Julia Carta, who has worked with Britney Spears, Sienna Miller, Mirander Kerr and Jude Law, is the lady responsible for that. Boys love beauty, too! The male contestants have lots of concealing applied with the Clinique Airbrush to get rid of dark circles and Julia, pictured with Ben Haenow, uses lots of light reflecting products on their skin . Head make-up artist Julia explained how important it is to prep the youngsters' skin. 'They do have a tough schedule so preparation is key to getting their skin ready. On a weekly basis we give all contestants a Red Carpet facial from Beautylab London - this deluxe VIP facial with the benefits of pure oxygen, stimulates collagen production and gives exceptional results to smooth and illuminate the complexion. 'To keep the skin crystal clear they use Proactiv + daily. All contestants have a winter TV tan from Beautylab London to give them a natural healthy glow. The rest is clever illuminating HD makeup.' To ensure the singers' skin looks flawless on TV under the harsh lighting, Julia explains how she and her team focus on concealing and use lots of light reflecting products to leave the skin looking youthful and radiant. And it's not just the girls who wear make-up. The boys have lots of concealer applied with the Clinique Airbrush to get rid of dark circles. They also have their brows threaded with Monika at Love Beauty (who runs the new Primark brow salons) and brows and lashes tinted to frame their face and make their eye colour pop. Tranquillity: Lauren Platt enjoys some chill out time in the Tresemme hair salon backstage . Beauty treats: Dermot O'Leary uses philosophy microdelivery triple-acid brightening peel to keep his complexion smooth and radiant before facing the nation . Julia added: 'They have a dab of lip balm and sometimes we’ve been known to curl their lashes and comb them through with clear mascara. To give them healthy glowing skin we give them a Beautylab London winter tan and use bronzer to give them a healthy glow.' As for presenter Dermot O'Leary - he has been reaching for the philosophy microdelivery triple-acid brightening peel to keep his complexion smooth and radiant before facing the nation. The pads promise to deliver advanced-skin brightening benefits, dissolve dull skin and buffer the appearance of fine lines - you'd hope so for £59.50 a pop! Speaking about the highs and lows of her job, Julia said: 'Make-up is a really powerful tool and I love making up the contestants; giving them bespoke looks every week. 'It's instant job satisfaction watching them grow and knowing the small part I play alongside our creative team gives them inner confidence which enables them to deliver a better performance. 'My least favourite thing is losing the contestants on a Sunday, I dread saying goodbye.' Sadly for Julia, she had to wave goodbye to Jack Walton and Lola Saunders on the ITV show this weekend. Style supremo: Gemma Sheppard, the X Factor stylist and the brains behind the carefully calculated outfit, shared the secrets behind Fleur's incredible look with FEMAIL . Secret weapon: One of Jamie Stevens' team can be seen using the Tresemme dust to give Betsy Blue's hair some real oomph . The X Factor Stylist, Jamie Stevens, says: ’We saw cornrows on the AW14 catwalks, but they can look quite severe, so we wanted to make this trend more wearable, Lauren has tight braids on one side and loose, soft waves on the other.' STEP 1: Apply TRESemmé Texture Style Tousled Wave Spray (RRP £5.50 for 200ml) to towel dried hair and roughly blow dry for a textured, matt finish. STEP 2: Using medium tongs begin working around the head, curling the hair but leaving the last two inches of each section so this stays straight. Once finished, loosely brush out the curls. (At this stage, we added tinsel hair extensions to complement Lauren’s outfit - you can use some clip in extensions for the same effect.) STEP 3: Use a tail comb to create a low side parting and create four tight braids, each one inch thick, plaiting from the front of the head to the nape and secure with an elastic. STEP 4: Tease the curls so they look undone and spray all over the hair with TRESemmé Ultimate Hold Hairspray (RRP £4.99 for 500ml). Get the look: Lauren has tight braids on one side and loose, soft waves on the other.

"Police say a prominent Washington D.C. rabbi secretly videotaped at least six women changing clothes at a ritual cleansing bath affiliated with his District of Columbia synagogue. Rabbi Barry Freundel, 62, was arrested by police on Tuesday at his home in the U.S. capital's upscale Georgetown neighborhood, a few blocks from his modern Orthodox synagogue, Kesher Israel Congregation. He has been charged with voyeurism and pleaded not guilty. Project voyeur: A Rabbi from the Kesher Israel congregation in Washington D.C.,  Rabbi Barry Freundel was arrested at his posh Georgetown home on Tuesday. Freundel, 62, has been charged with voyeurism . A document filed earlier this week in D.C. Superior Court says Freundel set up a recording device disguised as a digital clock radio in the changing and showering area of the National Capital Mikvah, which is affiliated with the Kesher Israel Congregation. Police say he recorded women on June 2 and September 13 and appears on tape setting up the device. Judge William Nooter ordered Freundel to stay away from all individuals he had helped convert to Judaism and participated with in the Jewish ritual bathing process known as mikvah, according to court documents online. He was also ordered to stay away from the Kesher Israel synagogue and the National Capital Mikvah. According to a police report, the alleged victim, a 35-year-old woman, told police she saw Freundel plugging in a black alarm clock that contained a video recording device while she was preparing to take a mikvah at the synagogue. Freundel explained to her the device was for ventilation purposes, according to the report. A few days later, the woman noticed that the clock was gone. It was back October 12, police said, and this time she grew suspicious and removed it. She later found “what appeared to be a video camera” in the clock and a card for electronic storage. She called police and turned the clock over to them. One woman said that she recalled seeing the clock as far back as 2012. Hidden camera: Court documents claimed the rabbi secretly recorded several women over a period of years as they showered and took a ritual bath. It's alleges a camera disguised as a clock was used to capture the film . Police said that on one recording device, they found more than 100 deleted files dating back to February. Some of the files were labeled with women’s first names. Police said they seized a camera-equipped clock radio in Freundel’s home, in addition to the one found in the shower area of the ritual bath, which is near the synagogue. The ritual bath is primarily for people converting to Judaism and by observant Jewish women at very intimate times as a way of becoming closer to God. Freundel, a modern Orthodox rabbi, is renowned in the religious community for his intellect and influence. He holds top leadership positions in regional and national bodies of Orthodox rabbis and is considered a national arbiter on conversion issues between modern Orthodox rabbis in the United States and religious leaders in Israel. It has left many women who used the bath fearful that they were recorded during a sacred ritual and that the violation may have been done by someone they trusted. Under surveillance: Six women were caught on camera but police believe hundreds more were videoed. Rabbi Barry Freundel, 62, had been with the Kesher Israel congregation for more than 25 years . An affidavit says police now think the rabbi had been “engaging in the criminal act of voyeurism in several locations and with the use of several devices and over a period of time.” Police listed items seized from the rabbi’s home as six external hard drives, seven laptop computers, five desktop computers, three regular cameras, 20 memory cards and 10 flash drives. Police have said the camera in the bath and another found in the home were part of clock-radios in which the hidden device was linked to a motion detector. As a misdemeanor, the maximum penalty for voyeurism is imprisonment of no more than one year, or a $2,500 fine, or both. Kesher Israel's congregation included Treasury Secretary Jack Lew and former Connecticut Senator Joe Lieberman, according to Washingtonian magazine.","Rabbi Barry Freundel, 62, had been with the Kesher Israel congregation for more than 25 years .

"Top poker player Phil Ivey, who is fighting a London casino for £7.7million 'winnings', has told the High Court his integrity is more important to him than a big win. The 38-year-old American, who lives in Las Vegas, is suing over a version of baccarat known as Punto Banco which he played at Crockfords Club in Mayfair over two days in August 2012. After four sessions, Mr Ivey was told the money would be wired to him and he left for the United States, but it never arrived, although his stake money of £1 million was returned. Phil Ivey (pictured left), who is fighting a London casino for £7.7million 'winnings', has told the High Court his integrity is more important to him than a big win. He told the court that he was accompanied at Crockfords by a friend of his, Cheung Yin Sun (right), who he called by her English name 'Kelly' Genting Casinos UK, which owns  Crockfords, says the technique of 'edge-sorting' which Mr Ivey used - which aims to provide the customer with an element of 'first card advantage' - is not a legitimate strategy and that the casino has no liability to him. It claims that Mr Ivey's conduct defeated the essential premise of the game of baccarat so there was no gaming contract. In court today he described himself as a professional gambler whose job it was to seek lawfully to  reduce the perceived 'house edge' - which gives a casino an advantage in games perceived to be of unequal chance, like baccarat. Mr Ivey, described on the World Series of Poker website as 'arguably the best poker player in the world', said: 'I consider that I would not be doing my job very well if I did not seek to use to my benefit weaknesses that I identify in the way that casinos set up or offer particular casino games. 'I use a variety of strategies whilst playing in casinos. No system is fail-safe and each time I play I risk failing to execute the strategy properly - some of these are very complex or difficult to execute - which usually results in me losing a lot of money. 'I consider all the strategies I use to be lawful and I would never cheat in a casino. It is not in my nature to cheat and nor would I risk my reputation by acting unlawfully in any manner.' Mr Justice Mitting, hearing the action in London, has been told by Mr Ivey's counsel, Richard Spearman QC, that the casino's case was 'plainly unsustainable'. He said that edge-sorting involves nothing more than using information available to any player simply from viewing the backs of the cards the casino chooses to use and making requests of the house - which it could accept or refuse - on the manner in which play is conducted. The 38-year-old American, who lives in Las Vegas, is suing over a version of baccarat known as Punto Banco which he played at Crockfords Club (pictured) in Mayfair over two days in August 2012 . 'Moreover, it is very easy for the casino to protect itself against the technique, not least by checking the cards for asymmetrical patterns before they are used in play, by not re-using the same cards after a shoe (the receptacle holding the decks) has been played, and by the elementary step of turning some of the cards once between shoes.' Mr Ivey said that successful play in most casino games is about gaining a lawful edge over the house by using all information available to players and being able to play for long enough to make it count. 'This is what I always look to do. Many gamblers, professional or otherwise, often believe they have an advantage or edge when in reality they do not, usually because they have failed to execute their strategy properly or because they have got their mathematics wrong from the start.' He said he was known in the gaming industry as an 'advantage player' and cheating is anathema to players like him. 'We observe the unwritten doctrine: how do I find a legal way to beat the house? Any method that could amount to cheating would breach the doctrine and cause you to be ostracised by your fellow players - we are all very careful to stay the right side of the line and we discuss advantage play strategies at length.' He said that like many professional gamblers, he is superstitious, which makes him like to play in certain conditions - such as asking friends or casino staff to leave the table if he is losing or gets a bad feeling about someone, requesting a change of dealers, tables or cards and shuffling the cards mid-shoe. 'Gambling and superstition go hand-in-hand. I guess it is human nature to look for patterns in life to try and bring order to events which we can't explain. Gambling is the same.' Mr Ivey said he was very angry when he heard the casino would not be paying out his winnings: 'I was upset as I had played an honest game and won fairly. Mr Ivey (pictured left outside court and right in action during the 2009 World Series of Poker) told the High Court: 'It is not in my nature to cheat and nor would I risk my reputation by acting unlawfully in any manner' 'I am highly successful in my job as a poker player and professional gambler and I would never do anything to risk my reputation. 'My integrity is infinitely more important to me than a big win, which is why I have brought these proceedings to demonstrate that I have been unjustly treated.' Mr Ivey said he was accompanied at Crockfords by a friend of his, Cheung Yin Sun, who he called by her English name 'Kelly'. She was a professional gambler and advantage player and, when they were introduced in early 2012, she told him about the advantage strategy she had been using successfully in baccarat - edge sorting. He said: 'She explained to me how a large number of casinos used cards with asymmetrical reverses - normally because they were defective and the casinos were sloppy in not checking the cards properly before use - and how she was able at times to use this asymmetry to gain an advantage over the house.' He added: 'In 2012, prior to playing at Crockfords, Kelly and I had edge sorted in Australia and Atlantic City. 'We won substantial sums of money doing so and we also lost substantial sums along the way when we got the strategy wrong or were not able to execute the sorts because of effective casino game protection methods. 'At all times when edge sorting, I considered that Kelly and I were playing lawfully and it never occurred to me that edge sorting could ever be viewed as an unlawful strategy. I continue to believe that it is lawful.' The case continues.

"It turns out most voters don't see a history of killing dragons in your free time as an impediment to holding office. Despite a campaign Maine Democrat state senate candidate Colleen Lachowicz as leading a 'disturbing double life' because she played the video game World of Warcraft, Lachowicz handily won election Tuesday. Lachowicz took the office with a final vote of 8,666 to 7,753 over incumbent Republican Tom Martin - a huge win despite the small numbers as the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee had named the district one of the country's key battlegrounds.

Lachowicz has found herself defending her pastime this campaign season, as well as online . posts she made under her role-playing alter ego 'Santiaga.' 'In Colleen’s online fantasy world, she gets away with crude, vicious and violent comments like the ones below. Maine needs a State Senator that lives in the real world, not in Colleen’s fantasy world,' reads the website that outed her as a hardcore gamer. Republicans have also tried to capitalize on Lachowicz's pastime with a mailer sent to voters in Maine's District 25. Her opponent kept his name out of the gaming attacks. The state party issued a press release calling her pastime a 'disturbing alter-ego.' The statement says Lachowicz 'has been living a time-consuming double life as a member of the World of Warcraft community... Today, Colleen is playing at level 85 –- the highest level one can attain. Studies have found that the average World of Warcraft gamer is 28 and spends 22.7 hours per week playing.' Top level: This is the player profile of Ms Lachowicz's character on the game. The Republican party called her hobby a 'time-consuming double life' Above the fray: Ms Lachowicz's opponent, state Sen Tom Martin, has not weighed in on the issue . The attacks highlight several of the online comments the candidate has made on message boards. They include: . 'These are some very bizarre and offensive comments, and they certainly raise questions about Lachowicz’s maturity and her ability to make serious decisions for the people of Senate District 25,'  Maine Republican Party spokesman David Sorensen said. Ms Lachowicz shot back saying that her pastime is not only mainstream -- it's downright common among American households, even career-minded adults. World of Warcraft, an online game that has players interact with each other in a fantasy land of wizards and warriors, has more than 9.1million subscribers. With the election finished, she believes the attacks ultimately backfired on Republicans. 'So . many people in the district were just appalled,' she told NBC News. 'And a lot . of the people I talked to were young, first-time voters and they seemed . to be the most incensed by it. They saw it as a personal attack over . something that is a normal activity these days — to play video games. And I heard some people say, 'Oh they're saying the same thing about . me.''

"Unite chief Len McCluskey today praised shadow health secretary Andy Burnham as the best performer on the Labour front bench . Militant union boss Len McCluskey said it ‘wouldn’t matter’ if Ed Miliband was run over by a bus. The general secretary of Unite stuck the knife into the Labour leader – by saying the politician he most respected was potential rival Andy Burnham. And he said he had still not decided whether he liked Mr Miliband – four years after he became leader. Mr Burnham, the former Health Secretary, is understood to be canvassing MPs to see if he can count on their support in a future leadership bid. While Mr Miliband had a terrible party conference, making a widely-derided speech in which he forgot to mention the deficit or immigration, Mr Burnham received a lengthy standing ovation. He has pleased the left of the party – and the unions – by campaigning on what he claims is the privatisation of the NHS. Earlier this month, Labour nearly lost the Heywood and Middleton by-election to UKIP – sparking fresh speculation over mr Miliband’s leadership. Speaking on the BBC Radio 4 PM programme, Mr McCluskey said: ‘Ed, and I hope this doesn’t happen, could get run over by a bus tomorrow, and it really wouldn’t matter who takes his place. ‘What matters is the policies. We’ve been saying this to Ed since he got elected. Labour have got to show that they are on the side of ordinary working people. ‘If he does that, he’ll be the next prime minister. If he fails to do that, then of course, he’ll be defeated and he’ll be replaced as the leader. And therein lies a huge challenge to Ed.’ Mr McCluskey said he thought Mr Miliband was a ‘decent man’ but he did not know him well enough to say whether he likes him or not. ‘He’s a decent man. I’m not sure the last time [we talked] we had a laugh,’ he said. ‘I don’t really know him well enough to say I like him. Any talk about “is he the right guy”, it really doesn’t enter into our vocabulary. I know that when I speak to him in private, I see a passionate guy, I see a guy who’s committed to certain things.’ It would not matter if Ed Miliband 'full under a bus', Mr McCluskey said - because it was all about the policies that the Labour party took up rather than the leader . Shadow health secretary Andy Burnham has grown in popularity by vowing to scrap the Government's health reforms . Asked who on the Labour front bench he most respects, Mr McCluskey said: ‘To be honest with you the person who impresses me most is Andy Burnham.’ Mr McCluskey accused the Labour leadership of not taking the UKIP threat seriously enough – something which nearly cost them a by-election in the north west, an area which should be rock-solid Labour. ‘We made it clear to the Labour party over a year ago, that if they thought UKIP were just a concern for the Tories, then they were wrong,’ he said. ‘The truth is that Ed speaks about “we’re listening and we know we’ve got to change”. At the moment we’re seeing a lot of listening but not a great deal of change. ‘Who knows what could happen. We were in spitting distance of losing a safe Labour seat, that’s why UKIP have got to be challenged.’ The Unite leader revealed he was a big fan of Downton Abbey, and doing karaoke to the Beatles. ‘You’ll go back to the times where there was almost a paternalistic [aspect] to society, some of the huge corporations,’ she said. ‘There’s a paternalism which was as part of, I suppose, trying to share the wealth. ‘I’m a big fan of Downton Abbey. Although it’s a bit sanitised, you reflect this paternalistic approach.’ He added: ‘I like karaoke. I like Beatles songs, my favourite song is In My Life. I can sing a nice song.’","General secretary of Unite stuck the knife into the Labour leader .

"Is this the death knell for  florescent U-shaped pillows? A doctor from Virginia, US, thinks he's come up with a solution to every traveller's worst problem; sleeping on the move. After suffering a sports related injury which made sleeping on trains, planes or in cars hellish, Dr Ravi Shamaiengar decided to invent something more supportive than what was already on the market. The result is Nap Anywhere, a disc-shaped head support pillow that starts out life as a flat disc about one inch thick. Sweet dreams: Dr Ravi Shamaiengar decided to invent a better support after suffering a sports related injury . Nap Anywhere costs $59 (£36) and comes in different colours including cobalt, lime (left) and cream (right) You twist it into shape, pull the shoulder strap on to hold it in place then rest your head on the foam structure which moulds slightly to your face and neck. It's small enough to fit into a laptop case or handbag and works by allowing the muscles in your neck to relax. Whether your on your daily commute or cradling a sleeping a baby and keen to catch up on forty winks yourself, this could be your saviour. Nap Anywhere costs $59 (£36) each and comes in  different colours including cobalt, lime, cream and crimson. Shamaiengar raised $67,819 (£42,000) for his project on Kickstarter - smashing his $40,000 (£25,000) goal. He wrote on his pitch: 'Have you ever fallen asleep upright, perhaps while traveling, and awakened with neck discomfort? Me too! 'Like many, I would use a U-shaped neck pillow. Unfortunately, the support I needed just wasn't there. In addition, they are often too bulky to fit in my backpack. It's small enough to fit into a laptop case or handbag and works by allowing the muscles in your neck to relax . Supportive: The neck pillow is easily put on and is small enough to fit into a laptop case or handbag . Strapping: the strap is adjustable and sits below the armpit . Whether your on your daily commute or cradling a sleeping a baby, this could be your saviour . 'And if you are like me, you feel claustrophobic when things are wrapped around your neck. 'And who wants to inflate a device every time you need to use it? 'During a flight about four years ago, I awoke with neck discomfort again and started drawing out the idea that would eventually become the NapAnywhere.' Out with the old: Foam pillows available  widely but, according to the doctor, that don't give adequate support . Dr Shamaiengar added: 'As a physician... I strive to have an impact on people's lives every day. I truly believe with the Nap Anywhere I can help more people than ever before. 'With your support we can fund the initial manufacturing runs and turn the neck pillow business on its ear.'

"A family who spent £3,000 painting their waterfront house bright yellow have blasted council bosses who told them they would have to change the colour. Stefano Varese, 41, and his elder brother Eduardo, 43, have branded the decision by planners 'absurd' and vowed to fight the move. Officials at Inverclyde Council refused the Varese family permission to keep the lemon zest colour scheme of their home in Greenock, western Scotland, and labelled it 'an intrusive feature within the streetscape' that was not in-keeping with the area. Council officials say the house is 'an intrusive feature within the streetscape' and not in-keeping with the area . Eduardo Varese and his younger brother Stefano have been told they will have to change the colour of their home in Greenock, western Scotland after they spent £3,000 painting it yellow . Mr Varese, who has lived at the four-storey property with his parents Adriano, 79, and Edilia, 80, since 1985, said he would appeal the decision. He pointed out the house has been painted white, cream, pink, blue and turquoise in the past without any issues. He said: 'I find it absurd and crazy that it was turned down, especially as there were 31 people in support of the house and only five objections. 'My immediate neighbours are also supportive so I'm genuinely surprised. 'I just don't understand why the council could refuse this when I think they have better things to be worried about in town. Of course we are appealing it.' His elder brother added: 'We have been left shocked by this and plan to fight it. We hadn't realised we would need permission just to paint the house but applied retrospectively. 'But to be told we must change it beggars belief. We plan to speak to our local politicians and hopefully have this reversed.' The row erupted after complaints from a handful of locals at a community council meeting. Planning bosses said the colour goes against the local development plan and guidance from Historic Scotland. The brothers say the colour was chosen to reflect the family's 'Mediterranean heritage' and the property's 'seaside setting' The property will have to be repainted in a 'soft, pastel hue' unless the decision can be overturned. A planning report stated: 'The bright yellow and gold tones of the dwelling are not colours which would traditionally have been used on a house of this period style or have been found within this part of the Greenock West End Conservation Area. 'The colours form an intrusive feature within the streetscape and are therefore not appropriate. 'There is no objection to the use of colour on The Esplanade to add variety to the appearance. However, the shades would require to be derived from soft, pastel hues found in traditional limewashing which are appropriate to the period of the buildings.' Mr Varese told planners the colour was chosen to reflect the family's 'Mediterranean heritage' and the property's 'seaside setting'. Council planning chiefs say houses in the area should be painted in 'traditional soft, pastel hues' There were five public objections including claims houses in the area were designed as 'elegant mansions' and looked good in stone or white. Mr Varese, whose now-retired parents moved to Scotland from La Spezia in northern Italy and ran successful chain of takeaway shops, added: 'It's not intrusive and if you have a look throughout the conservation area you will see that there are other houses painted in bright colours. 'I would understand it if the property was derelict or not maintained then obviously people would complain. But there is no issue here. 'We genuinely like the colour yellow and wanted to bring a bit of charm to the place and paint it a nice colour which is in line with the riverside location.' A Facebook page set up supporting the family has received more than 250 likes.","Brothers say they painted house yellow to reflect the family's 'Mediterranean heritage' and the property's 'seaside setting'

"A woman has taken it upon herself to show how conventional standards of beauty are shifted when a biracial identity is involved. Journalist Priscilla Yuki Wilson, who is half-Japanese and half-black, sent a photo of herself to editors in various countries across the world in a bid to see how they would use Photoshop to make it beautiful according to their cultural standards. She found that in contrast to similar projects in the past that have resulted in a huge variety of changes, people seemed to be at a loss as to how to improve her unique face. Scroll down for video . Original: Journalist Priscilla Yuki Wilson, who is half-Japanese and half-black, sent a photo of herself to editors in 18 countries across the world in a bid to see how they would us Photoshop to make it beautiful . In some cases, her African features were emphasized and her Asian ones erased, and in other cases the editors apparently created entirely new features to counter her racial ambiguity. Priscilla was inspired after seeing the results journalist Esther Honig had when she asked 40 people in 25 different countries to 'make her look beautiful' with the help of Photoshop. But when Priscilla did the same, the results were drastically different. 'As a biracial woman there is no standard of beauty or mold that can easily fit my face,' she writes on her blog. 'I am living in a culture that's still adjusting to my kind of face.' India:  The Photoshop job is barely noticeable - just a slight lightening of her skin tone and her lips made a shade pinker . Slovenia: An editor here made her completely unrecognizable by thinning out her face significantly, shrinking her nose, thinning her lips, coloring her eyes green and setting them further apart . Sweden: Priscilla's skin is given a dewy glow and her brown eyes are edited to look a shade lighter . Indeed, the edited versions of Priscilla's photo show just how much of a challenge the project seemed to be, with many countries hardly altering her at all, while others did so to an unrecognizable extreme. In India, for instance, the Photoshop job is barely noticeable - just a slight lightening of her skin tone and her lips made a shade pinker. And in Sweden her skin is given a dewy glow, and her brown eyes - edited to look a shade lighter than they are in real life - are lined in black eyeliner. U.S.: 'As a biracial woman there is no standard of beauty or mold that can easily fit my face,' she explains. Pictured: An American editor's mind-boggling Photoshop job . U.S.: Another person in the U.S., however, hardly touched her picture, simply making her skin a more even tone and filtering the photo in a glowing light . Macedonia: Priscilla is given a full face of make-up and her eyes are colored green . Montenegro: Blue eyes, full pink lips, wide, almond-shaped blue eyes, thicker brows and a smaller jaw make Priscilla look like a completely different woman . The countries that did the most digital editing went so far as to make her completely unrecognizable. Slovenia, for example, thinned out her face significantly, shrunk her nose, thinned her lips, colored her eyes green and set them further apart, seemingly creating a whole new woman. And one of the editors in the U.S. went even more extreme by giving her long wavy extensions and bangs, dark red lipstick, bright green eyes and fuller, more upturned lips. Mexico: One of the more startling transformations, this editor shrunk her head until it looked disproportionate to the rest of her body . Albania: Her photo is edited so that she has a more even skin tone and wide-set eyes . Pakistan: In this photo, the only noticeable difference is that her skin is lightened . Another person in the U.S., however, hardly touched her picture, simply making her skin a more even tone and filtering the photo in a glowing light. 'In contrast to Honig's results, where her face became a canvas to express more than a dozen contrasting beauty standards, I found that my face actually challenged the application of Photoshop in this instance,' writes Priscilla. Thanks to her personal experience as a biracial woman, she fully expected the results of her project to be jarringly different to those of Ms Honig. Israel: Here she was simply given a lick of light blue eyeshadow, a smaller jaw and a slightly thinner nose . Algeria: Algeria was apparently totally baffled as to how to make her beautiful, which resulted in her picture being made oddly transparent and given a pinkish tone . European Union: Here she has a lighter skin tone, thinner face and dark eyeliner . 'I was taught that my natural self did not comply with conventional standards set forth by society, saying fairer skin is better, straighter hair is more attractive, and that skinny tastes good,' she explains. One of the more mind-boggling transformations was done by a picture editor in Mexico, who shrunk her head until it looked disproportionate to the rest of her body. She told Aplus.com: 'In these images my Asian and African aesthetics are combined with Latina, Vietnamese and European features, either pigeon holing me into a more narrow racial understanding or reaching an entirely new level of racial ambiguity.' Singapore: Barely noticeable changes include lighter skin and eyes . United Kingdom: Her skin is lightened and has peachy undertones, and her dark brown eyes are altered to appear more hazel . Vietnam: Priscilla is again transformed into a completely different person, with a much smaller, rounder face, almond-shaped eyes, a long neck, a skinnier nose and smaller lips . Algeria was apparently totally baffled as to how to make her beautiful, which resulted in her picture being made oddly transparent and given a pinkish tone. And in Vietnam, Priscilla was transformed into a completely different person, with a much smaller, rounder face, almond-shaped eyes, a long neck, a skinnier nose and smaller lips. Meanwhile, in Israel, she was simply given a lick of light blue eyeshadow, a smaller jaw and a slightly thinned nose. Portugal: 'I am living in a culture that's still adjusting to my kind of face,' she says. In Portugal, she is given lighter skin and lighter eyes . Netherlands: The shape of her mouth is changed, and again the editor lightened her skin . Brazil: Here Priscilla has slightly yellower skin and fuller, more pink-hued lips . Priscilla says she feels that her project is especially timely since the world is witnessing a massive growth in mixed-raced populations. 'It appears that the genetic makeup of our society is likely to continue to diversify further and further,' she told Aplus.com. 'And as one of those changing faces of America, I wanted to see how photo-shoppers would change (or not change) a ""changing face""'. She added that she hopes her photo series creates 'a dialogue that specifically addresses race and ethnic features in an industry where beauty standards are apparently eurocentric.'","In Sweden, the EU and Vietnam, Priscilla Yuki Wilson's skin was lightened, and in Slovenia, her ambiguous Asian and African features were replaced with an entirely new racial identity, making her unrecognizable .

"It should be a moment of pure unadulterated joy, but this father certainly worries his children before revealing that he has won the lottery. Sitting his two sons down, he plays his cards close to his chest and instead drip-feeds the information about the win to them with several dramatic flourishes. The consummate entertainer builds up the drama and tension by seriously telling them he has some news, prompting the worried boys to ask if it is bad. Secret up his sleeve: This father made his sons think that he had some bad news to tell them. In truth the man had won over £1m in the lottery . The mood is sombre to start off as the dad reveals why he has called this meeting. The boys casually munch on strawberries and sip wine, not knowing how much their life is going to change in a matter of minutes. ‘Hey boys, I’ve looked forward to you coming over for a long time now,’ he says, as the boys settle down in front of him. ‘And I have a hard time trying to say this… It’s not easy for me to say this.’ ‘It is something bad?’ one son asks nervously. The father reassures his son that the news isn't bad and then proceeds to tell his children that he has quit his job. ‘What?’ one of the son says, clearly shocked. ‘But something else has happened,’ he says as the children lean forward. ‘I have won a little bit of money. Little but enough so that I can give a small thing to you.’ The man says: ‘I have won a little bit of money. Little but enough so that I can give a small thing to you,' as he hands over cash to his joyful sons . Counting more cash: The father keeps his cards close to his chest as he refuses to reveal just how much he's won. Instead he keeps giving his children more money . The cool kids continue to eat, not really paying much attention to dad. But they soon sit up when he reaches into briefcase and hands over a wad of cash. ‘Here is 5,000 kroner (£526) for you to go shopping tomorrow,’ he says. Their curiosity perked, they ask him how much he’s won. But he doesn’t answer, instead handing out iPads to the boys, who have now twigged that something is up. ‘Oh my god,’ they both say in English, as dad continues to give them more money. ‘Are you kidding me?’ one of his sons ask incredulously. The boys press their father, wanting to know how much exactly he won. ‘I have only won 200,000 kroner (£21,000),’ he says. The boys are shocked at the sum. ‘In cash?’ one of them says. But little does he know that his dad isn’t telling the truth. The father lets the news sink in before asking them if they've calmed down. Cheers! The happy trio celebrating their good fortune. The sons were taken aback when they found out that their father had won over £1m on the lottery . ‘I have something more to tell you. This is very difficult to [sic] me. I have lied to you.’ But before he reveals the full sum of his winnings, the joker dad hands over more piles of money to his boys, who are now truly taken aback by the turn of events. Reaching over to the far end of the table, the dad takes out even more money and starts slapping it down in front of the boys, who are now incapable of saying anything else other than ‘Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god.’ ‘Do you know how much money I have here?’ the father asks cheekily, as he keeps the game up. ‘Are you ready?’ he says, holding out a letter. Holding his head in his hands, the son says: ‘This is crazy.’ ‘Boys, I have won over 1 million kroner (over £100,000). A lot more than a million.’ As he says that, he places the letter in front of the boys, so they can see the sum for themselves. Pandemonium ensues as the boys realise just how much money their father has won. ‘15 million kroner (£1.6 million)?’ they shout. Chairs are pushed away from the table as the boys leap up, shouting ‘Oh my god’ over and over again, as the dad watches with a big smile on his face.","Danish father tricks the boys into thinking he has something bad to tell them .

"Pressure for change came after Indian dentist Savita Halappanavar died after being denied an abortion . The Irish Government has passed landmark legislation today to allow abortion in the country in certain circumstances. The laws enshrine a woman's right to a termination if her . life is at risk, including if she is at risk of taking her own life. The Protection of Life During Pregnancy Bill 2013 was passed comfortably at about 12.30am today after a second late night of debates, with 127 members of the Dail parliament voting in favour and just 31 against. Pressure to amend Ireland's strict . abortion laws came after a backlash following the death of Indian . dentist Savita Halappanavar, who died in an Irish hospital last year . after being denied an abortion. She was miscarrying 17 weeks into her pregnancy in October but doctors would not terminate the pregnancy. Her . widower Praveen claimed the couple had been told a termination was not . allowed because 'Ireland is a Catholic country', prompting a worldwide . outcry. Taoiseach Enda Kenny said it was time the women of Ireland have the rights they deserve enshrined in law. The . bill was passed as it was revealed yesterday that 11 women travelled . from Ireland to Britain every day for an abortion last year. 'We had 21 years of inaction, 21 years of inaction,' Mr Kenny said. 'What's going on here is medical clarity and legal certainty for the women of our country who have had a constitutional right conferred upon them.' Mr Kenny, a devout Catholic, had been threatened with excommunication by bishops as the controversial law  travelled through the Houses of the Oireachtas. The two-day debate wrapped up with the final vote shortly before 12.30am and one minister resigned following the decision. Irish Government has enshrined in law for the first time a woman's right to a termination if her life is at risk . Taoiseach Enda Kenny, who had been threatened with excommunication if the Bill was passed, said the law change comes after '21 years of inaction' Minister for European Affairs Lucinda . Creighton resigned and automatically lost the party whip after voting . against the Government in support of an amendment to the Bill. She wanted to change the rule that . allowed expectant mothers to seek an abortion on the grounds that she is . prepared to take her own life. She had called for alternative therapies to be offered instead but her demands were ignored. 'I'm very sad,' Ms Creighton said, after casting the vote that sealed her self-imposed exile. 'But . at the same time I feel a bit relieved because this is obviously . something that's been weighing on everybody's minds for months and . months.' She became the . fifth Fine Gael TD to be expelled over the contentious legislation, . after four colleagues voted against the Government in an earlier round . of votes. The High Court had earlier rejected a last minute attempt to secure an . injunction against the legislation on the grounds that politicians have . no right to vote on a bill that contains two provisions that have been . previously put to the Irish people in referenda and rejected. Her husband Praveen Halappanavar (seen together on their wedding day) said they were told she could not have an abortion because 'Ireland is a Catholic country' Pro-life activists had spent the past 48 hours outside Leinster House, praying beside pro-choice campaigners, some of whom waved placards . with Mrs Halappanavar's face. An . inquiry found medics in University Hospital Galway missed an early . opportunity to terminate her pregnancy on health grounds and . unacceptable clinical practice. The . case sparked massive debate among obstetricians and politicians over . whether the guidelines medics had been operating under were clear. Campaigners . have also pressed for abortion to be allowed in other circumstances, . such as fatal foetal abnormalities, but were told that it would not be . included. The legislation follows a 1992 . judgment by the Supreme Court in Dublin, known as the X case, where . judges ruled that abortion should be allowed if there was a threat to . the mother's life, including suicide. The . case was taken by a 14-year-old rape victim who became pregnant and was . refused permission by Irish authorities to travel to the UK for an . abortion. An inquiry into Mrs Halappanavar found medics in University Hospital Galway (pictured) missed an early opportunity to terminate her pregnancy on health grounds and unacceptable clinical practice . Ireland was also . under pressure after a European Court of Human Rights ruling that a . woman in remission with cancer was discriminated against because she was . forced to travel overseas for a termination. The . Fine Gael-Labour coalition government is the first in the 21 years . since the X case to attempt to pass legislation on abortion. The bill will next be considered by the Seanad - the upper house of parliament - where it will be passed. After . that, provided there are no demands for further amendments, the . legislation will be brought to President Michael D Higgins who will sign . off on it and enshrine it into Irish law. However, . he also has the option of referring it to the Supreme Court to test its . constitutionality or he can convene a meeting of the Council of State, . which also advises the president on whether a law is constitutional. The Government expects the law to be enacted before the Dail breaks for summer on Thursday.","Protection of Life During Pregnancy Bill 2013 passed after late night debate .

"British woman Joy Williams died from an infection following a buttock enlargement operation in Thailand 10 days ago . Thousands of women are ‘taking a big gamble’ with their lives by going overseas for cheap buttock implant operations, leading surgeons have warned. Popularity of buttock enlargement operations is said to have soared - with the trend said to be partly fuelled by young women trying to replicate the curvy figure of reality star Kim Kardashian. One surgeon said the number of those having the operation had risen by 150 per cent in the past decade. But Harley Street practitioner Dr Douglas Harrison urged women to be cautious about travelling abroad for the operation - saying their lives could be put at risk by unscrupulous providers. He spoke out after British woman Joy Williams, 23, died 10 days ago from infection after travelling from London to Thailand for a £2,000 buttock augmentation procedure. Dr Harrison, a member of the British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons, said that using a reputable surgeon in the UK will still only cost a four-figure sum. He said: ‘Buttock augmentation is perfectly safe if done properly, with a pretty low complication rate. ‘But if you do it in the backstreets for a cheaper rate, you are taking a big gamble. ‘Surgery in the UK with a reputable surgeon should certainly cost less than £10,000. It depends on the size of implants.’ Reality television show star Kim Kardashian, 34, is reported to have her behind insured for £13 million although she denies having it surgically-enhanced. Dr Harrison said that he has been carrying out buttock implants for the last 15 to 20 years and when he first started, people were having the procedure ‘mostly for medical reasons’ such as muscle-wasting conditions. ‘Now it’s roughly a 70:30 ratio in favour of cosmetic surgery,’ he said. Glamour model Mia Maffia, 23, went abroad for surgery because it was half the £7,000 price quoted in the UK - but one of her implants burst 10 days later leaving ‘litres of blood and pus oozing out of my buttocks' ‘It used to be a South American and African thing - in the southern hemisphere, they like shapely buttocks rather than large breasts - whereas in northern countries, the trend used to be the other way round.’ He believes the change started with the popularity of R&B and hip hop music videos featuring glamorous, scantily clad women with big behinds, and actresses such as Jennifer Lopez - before Kardashian’s booty stole the limelight. According to one plastic surgery firm, Longevita, 45 per cent of women asking for bottom-enhancing procedures in the last year have demanded ‘The Kim’. 45 per cent of women at one plastic surgery firm have gone in asking for 'the Kim' As well as female clients, Dr Harrison’s practice also attracts a large interest from gay men, who account for up to half of enquiries for buttock augmentation. Dr Harrison says there are two safe procedures - injecting body fat or inserting silicone implants - but warns ‘not to touch with a barge pole’ a third option, liquid silicone injections. Silicone injections are illegal in the UK and US but are still being performed in poorer countries - at huge cost. In 2012/13, 17 women in Venezuela died from the toxic injections. Even conventional surgery is not without dangers. ‘The risk comes from the fact that the incision for implants is close to the anus and there is always a risk of infection however much cleaning and washing you do,’ Dr Harrison says. While none of his patients has ever suffered infection, Dr Harrison warns: ‘If you go abroad for a cheap operation, hygiene standards vary considerably.’ Another expert, Dr Graeme Perks, president of the British Association of Plastic, Reconstructive and Aesthetic Surgeons, adds: ‘There is also the fact that no silicone implant lasts forever. ‘Anyone contemplating buttock implants has to ask themselves whether they want to go ahead knowing they will have to have another operation to take them out a few years later. ‘I would advise against going outside the EU for a cheaper operation because you do not know what the quality of silicone implants will be. ‘And if things go wrong, people are asking why the NHS should pick up the bill for treating complications.’ No figures are available for admissions to NHS hospitals due to infected buttock implants. But even life-threatening infection fails to put off some women. Glamour model Mia Maffia, 23, went abroad for surgery because it was half the £7,000 price quoted in the UK - but one of her implants burst 10 days later leaving ‘litres of blood and pus oozing out of my buttocks’. Doctors at Leeds General Infirmary had no choice but to remove the implants - although Miss Maffia begged them not to. She said: ‘I wanted a new bum so badly, at that point I’d have preferred the fever and pain over losing my perfect bum. But the surgeons had no choice. To save my life, the implants had to come out.’ But while still in hospital recovering, Miss Maffia asked a friend to book an operation to have a replacement pair of implants.","Thousands 'gambling' with their lives by having buttock surgery abroad .

"Television and movie streaming juggernaut, Netflix, is believed be planning to launch in Australia next year, with two Netflix acquisitions executives travelling to Sydney next week to meet with Australian-based distributors. The low-cost streaming service, which provides users with unlimited access to a library of selected movies and television shows, was launched in the U.S. four  years ago to great success, amassing 32 million subscribers in four years. Netflix is not available in Australia, though market sources estimate up to 200,000 Australians use the service via a VPN – software that makes a user's IP address appear as though it is located in the U.S. – paying the monthly subscription fee. Scroll down for video . Netflix, the online streaming service that produces House of Cards starring Kevin Spacey (pictured), is coming to Australia . Netflix began discussions in May about the Australian rights to movies and television series during the Los Angeles Screenings, Inside Film reported. The service is expected to launch in Australia and New Zealand in the first half of 2015 and to cost $10 per month. Foxtel's Presto service costs a $19.99 per month for 'all-you-can-eat' to new release movies and access to its back catalogue. Netflix has access to a large library of films and television series, as well as featuring acclaimed original series, such as House Of Cards, Orange Is The New Black and season four of Arrested Development. It is hoped that the arrival of Netflix on Australian shores might help curb high rates of illegal downloading in the country. Australia leads the world for illegal downloads of movies and television shows. It is estimated that 200,000 people currently use Netflix in Australia, using a VPN, which makes it appear as if the user's IP address is in the U.S. Pictured: Taylor Schilling (left) and Laura Prepon (centre) in Orange is the New Black . Netflix allows users access to movies and television shows, including Breaking Bad . The premiere of Game Of Thrones season four, which set a new piracy record, was downloaded illegally by more than 500,000 in the first 12 hours after it aired. Torrent Freak reported that 11.6 percent of these illegal downloads came from Australia, an achievement even more remarkable considering Australia's relatively small population. Several streaming companies are currently available in Australia, including Quickflix, Presto and Ezyflix, though none offer the same service at Netflix. Like Netflix, Quickflix allows users to access a library of film and television series, unlike Netflix it requires users to purchase recent releases individually, on top of their monthly fee. Presto offers unlimited access to its movie library for a  monthly fee, like Netflix does, though at this stage does not allow users access to any television series. Ezyflix operates on a postage-based system, with users selecting DVDs that are then posted to them. For the same monthly fee that Netflix users pay for unlimited access to movies and television series, Ezyflix users can get four DVDs per month sent to them, with one movie out at a time. Netflix has received plaudits for its original series including Arrested Development season five (cast pictured), Orange Is The New Black and House Of Cards .","Rumours Netflix ready for Australian launch next year .

"NASCAR driver Kurt Busch has been accused of domestic assault by his ex-girlfriend, and police in Delaware said Friday they are investigating. The Dover Police Department said the allegations were brought to the department Wednesday. Busch's ex-girlfriend, Patricia Driscoll, 36, said the allegations involved an incident inside his motorhome at a race at Dover International Speedway in September. The couple broke up about a week before. Scroll down for video . Former flames: NASCAR driver Kurt Busch has been accused of domestic assault by his ex-girlfriend, Patricia Driscoll, and police in Delaware said Friday they are investigating . Driscoll has filed court documents asking that a judge order Busch to stay away from her and not contact her. She also is asking that Busch undergo a psychiatric evaluation and be evaluated by a certified domestic violence treatment agency. The documents, filed Wednesday, say Busch was despondent the night of September 26 after his poor performance at the qualifying session. 'He was verbally abusive to her and said he wished he had a gun so that he could kill himself,' the documents say. Driscoll said Busch, 36, called her names and accused her of 'having spies everywhere and having a camera on the bus to watch him.' He then jumped up, grabbed her face and smashed her head three times against the wall next to the bed, Driscoll says in the documents. Driscoll says she pushed Busch away and ran from the bedroom, going to a nearby bus to put an ice pack on her head and neck. She said the incident caused her severe pain, difficulty breathing and bruising on her neck. Under investigation: Driscoll said the allegations involved an incident inside his motorhome at a race at Dover International Speedway in September - The couple broke up about a week before . A hearing in the case is scheduled for December 2. An attorney for Busch said he was cooperating with the investigation. 'This allegation is a complete fabrication by a woman who has refused to accept the end of a relationship and Mr. Busch vehemently denies her allegations in every respect,' attorney Rusty Hardin said in an emailed statement. NASCAR said it was aware of the situation and gathering information. Busch has not been charged. If he is, his case would play out after a series of high-profile cases involving prominent athletes ignited a national debate about how professional leagues handle allegations of abuse surface. A spokesman for Stewart-Haas Racing, Mike Arning, said Busch's team was still gathering facts about the incident and not in a position to comment. Known as The Outlaw in racing circles, Busch is the 2004 NASCAR Sprint Cup champion and one of the more accomplished drivers in the series. He was in his car practicing Friday for this weekend's race at Phoenix International Raceway in Avondale, Arizona. Driscoll is an executive for a small Washington, D.C.-based defense consulting firm and president of the Armed Forces Foundation, a nonprofit for veterans. The couple met at a foundation dinner in 2011, and after hitting it off, Busch became a spokesman and ambassador for the foundation. The group severed its ties with him Friday because of the 'serious nature of the allegations.' NASCAR star: Busch has previously seen a sports psychologist to learn to tame his emotions . On the track: His talent has never been doubted, with 25 career Cup wins and the 2004 championship . Busch has a history of run-ins on and off the track with drivers, NASCAR officials and reporters. He was suspended by Roush Racing for the last two races of the 2005 season after police cited him for reckless driving. A fan caught Busch on video verbally abusing an ESPN reporter during the 2011 season finale, and Busch was fined $50,000 by NASCAR after the clip was posted on YouTube. He was suspended for one race in 2012 for verbally abusing a reporter. Busch has seen a sports psychologist to learn to tame his emotions. But with Driscoll, he appeared to have softened his image. She and her son, Houston, became fixtures in Busch's life. The pair came across as a happy couple when Busch attempted to complete the Coca Cola 600 and the Indianapolis 500 on the same day earlier this year, a feat only a handful of other drivers have attempted. They welcomed reporters into her Ellicott City, Maryland, home and cameras followed them around for weeks for the NBC documentary Kurt Busch: 36. They acted like a family: Busch, Driscoll and Houston went on a hunting trip this year in New Zealand and Busch took Houston fly fishing. The child got the nickname The Mini Outlaw as a regular at the track. She celebrated his accomplishments publicly. Busch made the Chase for the Sprint Cup championship in his first season at Stewart-Haas Racing, and Driscoll tweeted regular updates from his NASCAR races this season. They frequently embraced on the track, or were seen walking hand in hand, never shying from public displays of affection. Busch's talent has never been doubted, with 25 career Cup wins and the 2004 championship. But his prickly personality has scared away sponsors, and rides with deep-pocketed owners Jack Roush and Penske fizzled. His career detoured into journeyman status with single-car teams the last two seasons before landing at SHR.","Busch's ex-girlfriend, Patricia Driscoll, 36, said the allegations involved an incident inside his motorhome at a race at Dover International Speedway in September .

Mocked: Le Parisien said David Cameron's angry reaction was really prompted by the recent success of UKIP . ‘Under immense pressure from Eurosceptics, notably since the last European elections which saw Ukip win more than 27 per cent of the vote, David Cameron believes that this demand does not support the issue of Britain being in the EU,’ the Paris daily wrote.

"Property financier Brian Gilmour has outlined a £45million blueprint to make struggling Ayr United a Premiership force in six years. Glasgow-based Gilmour, 44, is in takeover talks with Somerset Park chairman Lachlan Cameron. If he succeeds, he will pursue plans for a new 10,000-seat stadium, housing and entertainment village, delivering an estimated 900 jobs and ploughing over £100million into the local economy. Brian Gilmour has outlined a £45m blueprint to make struggling Ayr United a Premiership force in six years . Built in the town's Heathfield area, close to Somerset Park, the £10m sports and entertainment village would be funded by a development of 320 private and affordable homes over the two sites. Seeking a swift resolution to 12 months of negotiations, Gilmour - the managing director of social housing lenders Carduus - wants to relocate Ayr to their new state-of-the-art home by 2018, targeting the top six of the Premiership by 2021. The club are currently battling to avoid relegation to League Two, and sacked manager Mark Roberts this week, yet Gilmour told Sportsmail: 'There is no reason why Ayr United should not be playing in the top half of the Premiership. 'Lachlan Cameron and I have spoken about the principle of me having majority ownership in Ayr United. The current Ayr United first team photo, posted by the club on their Twitter account . Gilmour plans to turn the current stadium at Somerset Park into a new 10,000-seat ground . 'I think I have offered a good price for the business. 'Lachlan is aware of my proposals to develop a new stadium via the existing ground and the new land the club have an existing option on. 'We have got pretty close to the terms we want to lay out. 'Lachlan is a good guy, he wants Ayr to succeed. I want to pay him what I think is a fair price and at the end of the process I want to control an Ayr United with no debt. 'If I succeed I would like to see a new stadium built in three years. I want it to be a place where people want to go. Ayr United need to be an intrinsic part of the community. 'We propose to build around 320 homes and the whole cost of the project will be £45m. 'That will generate 900 full-time, permanent jobs and will benefit the local economy to the tune of £110m. The £10m sports and entertainment village would be funded by a development of 320 private and homes . Glasgow-based Gilmour, 44, is in takeover talks with Somerset Park chairman Lachlan Cameron . 'South Ayrshire Council have been very good and are very keen for Ayr United to have a new stadium.' Local roofing contractor Hugh Clarke also discussed plans for a possible Ayr bid in September. However, Gilmour has employed architects to cost and develop his detailed plans and believes a sports village, incorporating a stadium, family entertainment and restaurants, holds the key to generating the funds required to reach the Premiership. 'I am laying the foundations for that to happen,' he added. 'The one thing I firmly believe is that every single person who wants to be involved in delivering Premiership football for Ayr United is already at the club. 'If they want to be there they can be there. 'It's hard work. Anybody at the club, in the academy or the staff, who wants to put the effort in can be in the Premiership.' Speaking from America Ayr chairman Lachlan Cameron confirmed discussions with Brian Gilmour, but was reluctant to comment further saying: 'I have spoken to Brian, but there is really nothing to report on it. There is nothing to talk about.'","Property financier Brian Gilmour has big plans for Ayr United .

"Teachers do not enjoy a life of 'short days and long holidays' but are swamped by on pointless box-ticking, form-filling and unnecessary work, Nick Clegg said today. The Deputy Prime Minister defended teachers from claims they have an easy life, and promised to tackle their excessive workload. He urged school staff to highlight examples of paperwork and administration which could be scrapped. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg used a speech at Bellville Primary School in Clapham to promise to cut the workloads of the nation's teachers . International evidence suggests that teachers in England work a 48-hour week on average, with only 20 of those spent in the classroom. The rest of their time is taken up with tasks such as administration, lesson preparation and marking. Data shows that England's teachers spend more time on these tasks than those in countries with high-performing education systems. In a speech in London, Mr Clegg said: 'Some people are still under the misguided impression that it's a profession built around short days and long holidays. 'But talk to a teacher and they'll tell you about their working week of 50 hours or more. 'They'll also tell you how much of this time they feel is wasted on unnecessary processes, box ticking and form filling.' He said too many teachers spend hours 'struggling to stay on top of piles of incident reports, over-detailed lesson plan templates, health and safety forms, departmental updates, training requests and so on that threaten to engulf them every week'. He added: 'Some of this work is unavoidable. Every school needs to ensure the safety of its pupils and staff and maintain the highest standards possible. 'But should you really have to fill in multiple risk assessment forms for every school trip when just one form would be better?' Speaking at a south London school, Mr Clegg said that teachers can submit their ideas for the workload challenge, also supported by Education Secretary Nicky Morgan, via a dedicated page on the Times Educational Supplement's (TES) website. 'We're asking teachers across the country to take a long, hard look at how they spend their working day and what pointless processes and paperwork they think should be cut or scrapped altogether,' Mr Clegg said. The move was welcomed by teaching unions. Dr Mary Bousted, general secretary of the Association of Teachers and Lecturers (ATL), said: 'ATL is pleased the coalition Government is finally taking teachers' workloads seriously. It is a tragedy that for so long teachers and school leaders have felt pressurised into doing tasks which do nothing to improve children's education. 'Teachers are spending too many hours on bureaucratic tasks such as five-page lesson plans, or multi-coloured marking, instead of being allowed to focus on effective teaching and learning to meet the needs of their pupils.' After outlining his plans, Mr Clegg met teachers Camille Hazeldene and Jessica Avison about his plan to cut paperwork in schools . Shadow education secretary Tristram Hunt said: ' You can't trust a word Nick Clegg says - he is part of the Government that has denigrated the professionalism of teachers, allowing unqualified teachers into classrooms, dismissing the profession as 'enemies of promise' and letting teacher workload spiral. 'His attempts to distance himself from his own Government's dismal record on teacher workload will be met with great scepticism and the teaching profession will be right to hold him to account for the decisions that he has taken.'","Deputy Prime Minister promises to cut pointless box-ticking and forms .

"Glenn Cooper was asked to apply for a special license to allow his guests to stand up and drink free alcohol at his own brewery for his retirement party. Mr Cooper, who is an executive chairman at Coopers Brewery in Regency Park of South Australia, said following the bureaucratic madness, it has made it difficult for businesses. His company had already received approval but he was required to apply for another license to be able to host people in ‘a fenced off area where people can stand up’ and drink alcohol outside. It's reported that in South Australia, people are 'not allowed to stand up and drink alcohol in outdoor areas' 'This is because in South Australia you are not allowed to stand up and drink alcohol in outdoor areas,' Mr Cooper told Adelaide Now. ‘In Melbourne and Sydney, they have sectioned off areas where you can have a drink. ‘We’re the only state in Australia where that happens. It causes a lot of frustration for people.' Mr Cooper also added that his children had travelled interstate and when they returned home, they said 'boy we’re a bit of a nanny state because of these rules'. A chairman was asked to apply for a special license to allow his guests to stand up and drink free beer at his own retirement party . The regulation follows after treasurer Joe Hockey addressed his frustration in parliament on Wednesday over a red tape experience he encountered at a pizza restaurant with his family. 'I went to put the two tables together and the owner of the pizza shop came out and said 'I'm sorry Mr Hockey, you're not allowed to do that, the council regulation prevents you putting the two tables together', he told an audience in Canberra. 'There were eight of us, so I went inside to get another chair and they said, 'Sorry Mr Hockey, they've said you can only have seven chairs [outside], not eight'.' 'That’s when I exploded. I actually tracked down the local mayor and I think the whole suburb heard the conversation. 'When excessive red tape lowers productivity it ultimately lowers growth and the standard of living for all Australians.' The regulation follows after treasurer Joe Hockey addressed his frustration in parliament on Wednesday over a red tape experience he encountered at a pizza restaurant with his family . The federal government held its' second 'red tape repeal day' on Wednesday. The government has a plan to cut $1 billion in red tape every year, with two parliamentary repeal days each year to cut unnecessary and costly legislation and regulation. 'The 2014 Spring Repeal Day will repeal nearly 1,000 pieces and more than 7,200 pages of legislation and regulation,' the Government website said. 'This is in addition to the 2014 Autumn Repeal Day, which repealed over 10,000 pieces and 50,000 pages of legislation and regulation. This brings the total net deregulatory savings to date to over $2.1 billion.' This year, Australia ranked 124 out of 148 countries for ‘burden of government regulation’, according to the World Economic Forum Global Competitiveness Index.","A chairman was asked to apply for a special license to allow his guests to stand up and drink free beer at his own retirement party .

The letters by prominent art critic John Ruskin expose the torment behind the story of his doomed marriage to Perth-born Gray and her affair with his one-time friend, the Pre-Raphaelite artist John Everett Millais. Gray and Ruskin were married for five years but the marriage was never consummated due to Ruskin's disgust at some aspect of his wife's body. Intimate letters show the scandalous affair of aristocrat Effie Gray (centre) with the artist John Everett Millais (right) , who was her husband John Ruskin's (left) friend. But Effie complained Ruskin refused to ever have sex with her during their five-year marriage over disgust at her body . As Effie wrote to her father: 'He alleged various reasons, hatred to children, religious motives, a desire to preserve my beauty, and, finally this last year he told me his true reason... that he had imagined women were quite different to what he saw I was, and that the reason he did not make me his wife was because he was disgusted with my person the first evening.' While married to Ruskin, Effie modeled for Millais' painting The Order of Release, in which she was depicted as the loyal wife of a Scottish rebel who has secured his release from prison. She then became close to Millais when he accompanied her and Ruskin on a trip to Scotland in order to paint Ruskin's portrait. During this time, spent in Brig O'Turk in the Trossachs, they fell in love, and after her marriage to Ruskin was annulled, she then married Millais. The love triangle has long captured the public imagination and it was recently made into the Hollywood film Effie Gray, directed by Oscar-winning actress Emma Thompson and starring Dakota Fanning and Greg Wise. Of the collection of 75 letters signed by Ruskin, 37 are previously unpublished. The collection comprises 75 letters signed by Ruskin, of which 37 are previously unpublished. They are expected to fetch up to £40,000 ($64,156) when they go under the hammer next month . They provide an uncensored insight into the dark heart of Ruskin's blackest years, showing his remorse, anguish and anger. The letters are expected to fetch up to £40,000 ($64,156) when they go under the hammer. Although written to a priest, many of Ruskin's letters digress from the subjects of the Church and the Lord's Prayer, instead imparting the distressed confessions of a man lamenting the folly of his younger self. He wrote: 'I married like a fool, because a girl's face pleased me. She married me for my money, breaking her faith to a poor lover.' Effie Gray's broken-hearted lover was just one whose life was ruined by contact with the ill-fated marriage. The story provided the inspiration for the new Hollywood film Effie Gray, starring Emma Thompson (left) and Dakota Fanning (right) In another letter from the collection, Ruskin makes reference to Rose La Touche, the student he subsequently fell in love with, and tells how his split from Effie corrupted his later relationship. He writes: '...in the last ten years, and especially in the last year, my life has been set on a cast - and that of a righteous girl with it. - And both are destroyed.' But the profound misery which is evident in these letters is matched by a hard vindictiveness, hinted at in a 'wretch' and 'who had been my friend, once.' One letter betrays the ruthlessness of its writer as he informs Malleson: 'The first condition of my keeping friends with anybody is that when I ask them to do a thing, they should do it. 'If - without showing just reason - they twice give me trouble to ask twice, I have done with them.' Dakota Fanning (right) in this year's film Effie Gray, which also starred Greg Wise (left) as John Ruskin . Matthew Haley, head of the Bonhams book department, said: 'These letters are a vivid reminder that there was passion and tumult underneath the outward formality of the Victorians. 'Here we see the bitterness and regret that haunted Ruskin throughout his life.' As well as providing the inspiration for the new Hollywood film Effie Gray, the Victorian love-triangle scandal was the focus of the 1912 silent film The Love of John Ruskin, the 1975 BBC series The Love School starring Peter Egan, and numerous stage plays. The letters will be auctioned at Bonhams Fine Books, Atlases, Manuscripts and Photographs sale in London on November 12.","X-rated letters show scandalous love triangle involving aristocrat Effie Gray .

"One small mouse caused a five hour delay on a flight from Norway to the US. Norwegian Air Shuttle, already plagued by costly flight . delays on its long-haul routes, was forced to delay the flight on Tuesday thanks to a hunt for a mouse . inside the cockpit. 'The pilots discovered a mouse on flight deck,' said Charlotte Holmbergh, a spokesperson for the airline. 'We had to . make sure that no cables or wires had been chewed.' Mouse hunt: The rodent was spotted just before take off and caused the flight to be severely delayed . 'This does not happen very often, but it does happen from time to time.' The incident took place aboard one of Norwegian's new Dreamliner airplanes. According to Romerikes Blad, a local Norwegian paper, the mouse was spotted while the plane was preparing to take off. Staff then frantically began to search the cabin for the rodent but the flight only took off from Oslo Gardermoen for JFK airport in New York after 11pm, five hours after it was scheduled to. While that might sound like an inordinate amount of time for one small rodent, Holmbergh explained, 'In such situations, a pest control company must board the plane. The mouse needs to be found and then removed.' Spot of bother: The Airline has suffered a string of delays and technical troubles on Boeing 787 Dreamliners . Norwegian has been expanding rapidly with new bases around Europe in  Britain and Spain. This summer the airline began flying the competitive flight path between London and New York, and last year became the only European budget carrier to fly long-haul routes. Unfortunately, a string of technical troubles with its new BOEING 787 Dreamliners delayed many of its flights, leaving passengers stranded at airports from Bangkok to Florida. The airline has since improved its reliability. 'At least the mouse was caught,' Holmbergh added.","Norwegian Air Shuttle was delayed hours on Tuesday thanks to a mouse .

"Savannah Guthrie admitted that she has had a Botox injection on this morning's Today Show - and readily confessed to her shocked co-hosts that she would gladly consider having it done again in the future. While discussing the rising number of men who are indulging in the non-invasive cosmetic enhancement during the show's 'Trending' segment, the 42-year-old anchor revealed that she had one Botox injection in 2009, but wasn't overly thrilled with how it turned out. 'I have done it, I did it in 2009,' she told Matt Lauer, Al Roker, Carson Daly and Josh Elliott while looking at a picture of herself during an interview with President Obama in October 2009. 'Really, I did it, I was working here [at the time]. Scroll down for video . 'I have never done it again': The Today Show confessed that she only had the one injection . Now and then: Savannah, pictured left on today's show, admitted that she doesn't think she 'looks that good' in the image of her taken shortly after her Botox injection, right . '[I had it] in my forehead, that's where everyone did it. And you know what? I remember looking back and thinking, ""I don't think that looks that good"".' Despite her reservations about her appearance after the injection, Savannah, who gave birth to daughter Vale, her first child with husband Michael Feldman, in August, admitted that she would definitely consider having Botox again. 'I have never done it again,' she said of the procedure. 'I'm not saying I wouldn't though; I would. And I'm mean, I'm definitely a candidate for Botox... Because of wrinkles. On your forehead, they're supposed to smooth them out.' Savannah's confession came as a surprise to her co-hosts, who were full of questions about the cosmetic procedure - and about the new mother's opinions on whether people should have it done. 'It's... a low-grade chemical weapon,' Josh joked, before adding: 'You know what, it's like a Zamboni, it just smooths you out.' When asked whether they would ever consider indulging in 'Bro-tox' - the nickname given to the injection when it is used by men - all four of Savannah's co-hosts made clear that it is not something they would ever consider. Tried and tested: Despite not being thrilled with the results of the injection, Savannah confessed she would consider trying it again in the future . 'No.. I feel like we've earned [our wrinkles],' Josh said, before Al suggested that if Botox was ever 'sold as bacon', he might consider it. The Today Show men are not alone in their negative opinions of the injection. Earlier this year, actress Jennifer Aniston spoke out against the use of Botox, questioning why so many women feel pressured into appearing ageless. 'There is also this pressure in Hollywood to be ageless,' the 45-year-old told make-up artist Bobbi Brown in an interview for Yahoo Beauty. Mother and baby: The 42-year-old gave birth to daughter Vale in August and has only recently returned to the show . Happy families: Earlier this month Savannah confessed that returning to work without her daughter felt like 'her heart is outside her body' 'I think what I have been witness to, is seeing women trying to stay ageless with what they are doing to themselves. I am grateful to learn from their mistakes, because I am not injecting s**t into my face. 'I see them and my heart breaks. I think, ""Oh god if you only know how much older you look.""' In February 2013, actress Nicole Kidman also admitted that she regretted having used Botox in the past and insisted that she would never again be tempted by the wrinkle-smoothing injection. 'I did try Botox, unfortunately,' she told Italian newspaper La Repubblica. 'But I got out of it and now I can finally move my face again.'","The Today Show host, 42, confessed to her co-stars that she had a Botox injection in 2009 .

"Celtic striker Anthony Stokes is a £1.5million transfer target for Championship club Cardiff City. The Republic of Ireland striker scored the Parkhead club’s winning goal in Saturday’s 1-0 victory over Motherwell — his seventh strike of the season. A first-choice pick under Ronny Deila on the left wing, the 26-year-old signed a new three-year deal back in October 2013. Anthony Stokes has scored seven times in 24 appearances for Celtic so far this season . Stokes (centre) celebrates after scoring the only goal of the game for Celtic against Motherwell on Saturday . Struggling for goals and creativity, however, Cardiff are interested in luring Stokes back to English league football, where he started his career with Arsenal and spent three seasons at Sunderland. Ninth in the English Championship and two points off the play-off places, the Welsh club want to bolster their promotion hopes with new attacking options in next month’s transfer window. ‘If we can add a couple to the group, things will be a lot better,’ admitted City manager Russell Slade before Saturday’s 0-0 draw with Rotherham. ‘We’re going in the right direction — but I think there’s lots of work still to be done and a lot of improvement still to come from the group that we’ve got.’ Stokes has secured three league title medals and two Scottish Cup medals, scoring 73 goals in 151 domestic appearances and two goals in Europe. He could be one of a number of January departures from Celtic, with Kris Commons, Leigh Griffiths and Beram Kayal also assessing their options. 26-year-old Stokes is the target of a £1.5million bid from Championship side Cardiff . He has been a first-choice pick under Ronny Deila (pictured) on the left wing this season . Meanwhile, Stokes has heaped praise on Celtic’s defence following their performance against Motherwell in the weekend’s victory. Most of the post-match attention focused on the champions’ attacking play but the Irishman was keen to highlight the contribution of the backline, particularly Efe Ambrose, who has returned to the side in recent weeks following Jason Denayer’s injury. ‘Efe has come in and done very well,’ Stokes told the club’s website. ‘Obviously Jason has a niggle at the minute but we have that quality in the squad — if someone is injured or is lacking form, someone can step in and take their place — and Efe has been outstanding. At present, Kenwyne Jones is Cardiff's top scorer with six goals - one less than Stokes has scored . Stokes (right) fires the ball home to put Celtic 1-0 up against Motherwell on Saturday afternoon . ‘They have been doing very well. We have been strong at the back and Craig Gordon has been immense since coming in. ‘We have momentum at the minute, winning games and we’re keeping clean sheets as well.’ Celtic’s win over the Steelmen was their seventh successive league victory and Stokes insists they are determined to continue their form over the rest of the festive period. We always go out with the mentality of trying to win every game,’ he said. ‘Confidence is high at the minute and momentum is good and we will try to take our chances. ‘We haven’t set a target. We just want to pick up three points in every game. We are on a good run at the minute and we want to maintain that.’","Anthony Stokes has scored seven goals for Celtic so far this season .

"A couple with a record-breaking family were buried together today - with many of their 130-plus grandchildren looking on. Hans and Josie Schaffer, who died three days apart, had so many grandchildren and great-grandchildren they had difficulty keeping track of them. Son Jonathan - one of their 11 children - said at the last count he thought there were 'between 130 and 140' - living in the UK, Australia and America. Hans and Josie Schaffer with two of their great-grandchildren. The couple broke a world record in 2008 for producing the most grandchildren and great-grandchildren. The were buried today after passing away within 72 hours of each other . Scores of them flew to Britain to say their farewells to the couple - and had to arrive in shifts to pay their last respects. Relatives said that Hans, 92, passed away with a broken heart just 72 hours after his wife Josie, who was 83 and suffering from dementia and a chest infection. Jonathan, 55, said his father lay next to her as he said his goodbyes and at that point gave up his three-year battle with stomach cancer. The couple made headlines in 2008 when their family numbered 56 grandchildren and 43 great-grandchildren. At the time Josie said: 'We worked hard at our family, we were told, in the days of feather mattresses, when you have a row with your spouse you shake the bed and get back in it.' In the six years since, it has grown even bigger although none of their children seem to have an exact figure on its size. Hans and Josie, who lived in a bungalow in Bedford, had been together since WW2 when Hans was a German prisoner of war in a camp in Worcestershire and Josie was 14. They met when her bike got a puncture outside the camp and he helped her out and they got talking. A young Hans and Josie Schaffer, pictured shortly after they met in 1944 while Hans was a German prisoner of war at a camp in Worcestershire . Hans was released in 1947 and they got married and had their first child in 1948, before moving to Swindon, Wilts. Jonathan, a car mechanic, said: 'I think they had it planned, they were soul-mates who were utterly devoted to one another. 'They were inseparable. 'The longest they were ever apart was in the three weeks before they died, and they were just in separate bedrooms in their house. 'They made us promise they would stay together, so we made sure they were treated at home. 'I know they could feel each others' presence through the walls and that kept them going. 'When mum passed, dad was very ill but he understood and we put him in the bed with her so they could lay together. Hans and Josie Schaffer pictured at their home in Bedford, where they relocated during retirement . 'He said his goodbyes, you could see the sadness in his eyes, he was heartbroken. 'It was then that he gave up. 'He was given six months to live in 2011 and he survived for three years, he was a fighter. 'That's how I know he really died of a broken heart.' After his release from the camp, Hans spent years working as a farmer, before working for Vauxhall as a welder and assembler. Josie looked after their children full-time and each year, the family took a trip to eastern Germany to visit Hans' relatives. Altogether they had 13 children, but two - Shirleen, born in 1948, and Carleen, born in 1961, died at birth. The other children are Shannette, 65, Roberta, 63, Veronica, 62, Bernadette, 61, Paul 60, Katrina, 58, Adrian, 56, Jonathan, 55, Carl, 54, Donna, 50 and Stephen, 48. Hans and Josie pictured on holiday - their family have described the couple as soul-mates . In the 1980's, the couple moved to Perth, Australia but returned to the UK 13 years ago and settled in Bedford to retire. The family has grown so large that Jonathan says it has become incredibly hard for them all to keep in touch. Jonathan, who lives in Bedford, said: 'We are spread all over the world. 'There are three in Australia, two in America, but we love having a large family. 'It was hectic and always a mad rush in our house, but there were so many funny times and my parents loved to have a laugh. 'My dad used to play cards for money, he really enjoyed playing cards, I don't think there would have been food on the table if he hadn't've. 'They will be dearly missed by all of us.'","Hans first met Josie Schaffer in 1944, while he was a German prisoner of war .

"The Vatican has unveiled new high-tech, energy-saving lighting and air purification systems to protect Michelangelo's delicate Sistine Chapel frescoes from damage caused by ever-growing crowds of tourists. Dust brought in from outside, body sweat and carbon dioxide pose a major risk to the masterpieces, which are more than 500 years old. They include one of the most famous scenes in the history of art - the arm of a gentle bearded God reaching out to give life to Adam. To protect the frescoes, the Vatican has decided to restrict the number of visitors to the chapel - where popes are elected in secret conclaves - to 6 million a year. Scroll down for video . After three years of scientific and technological work, the Vatican Museums installed a new air conditioning and air exchange system as well as a new lighting system with LED technology that illuminates Michelangelo's frescoe masterpiece The Creation of Adam . Michelangelo's masterpiece: The world-renowned The Creation of Adam. The number of visitors to the site has grown tremendously . Light of God: The new lighting system has three different settings as part of a drive to protect the beautiful interior . Protected: The frescoes, inaugurated in October 1512 by Pope Julius II, underwent a major 14-year restoration that ended in 1994 . The previous lighting and air conditioning systems were installed in 1994 - when the number of visitors stood at about 1.5 million - and had become inadequate to protect the work of the Renaissance master. The new air filtering and conditioning system, which is virtually invisible to visitors and uses pre-existing duct openings, moves air at a very slow speed so as not to damage the frescoes. Hidden cameras, including two on the massive Last Judgement panel behind the altar, check the number of people while some 70 monitors control machines outside the chapel that determine air flow, filter out dust and reduce humidity. 'This chapel is a unique structure so we spent a great deal of time understanding how air flows here in order to map the technology,' said John Mandyck, chief sustainability officer for United Technologies unit Carrier, which developed the system. The chapel takes its name from Pope Sixtus IV, who commissioned restoration work between 1477 and 1480 . The frescoes include the famous Last Judgement on the wall behind the altar, painted between 1535 and 1541 . Michelangelo painted the Sistine Chapel ceiling between 1508 and 1512, under the patronage of Pope Julius II . Hidden cameras, including two on the massive Last Judgement panel behind the altar, monitor the more than 6 million visitors a year to the chapel . Holy duty: One of the functions of the Sistine Chapel is as a venue for the election of each successive pope in a conclave . 'Air flows differently here than it does, say in an office building or even another church,' he told reporters during a evening presentation after the Vatican Museums had closed for the day to tourists. The new lighting system, made by Germany's Osram, uses some 7,000 LED (light emitting diode) lamps consuming up to 90 per cent less electricity than previously, reducing heat to further protect the frescoes. It has three levels of lighting. One very low level will be used when the chapel is empty, a medium level of illumination will be used when the chapel is open to tourists and a third, much brighter and hotter level will be used only several times a year during papal ceremonies. The frescoes, inaugurated in October 1512 by Pope Julius II, underwent a major 14-year restoration that ended in 1994. They also include the famous 'Last Judgement' on the wall behind the altar, which the artist painted separately between 1535 and 1541. Neither the Vatican nor the companies would disclose the cost of the work.","Dust brought in from outside, body sweat and carbon dioxide pose a major risk to the masterpieces .

"From the 'amateur' cook who was already a culinary champion to the infamous 'Alaskagate' episode, this series of Great British Bake Off hasn't been without its controversies. Now former contestant - and last year's finalist - Ruby Tandoh, 22, has weighed in, calling editors of the show 'malicious' in their handling of Diana Beard, the grandmother who quit the show following accusations of sabotage. 'It was a case of the editors being, if not malicious, then at least completely thoughtless about how something would come across,' says Tandoh. Scroll down for video . Critic: Ruby hit out at BBC editors saying they were 'thoughtless' if not malicious in their editing of Alaskagate . Tandoh, who has also taken to Twitter in defence of Beard, is no stranger to Great British Bake Off controversies herself, having been at the centre of a flirting storm in the wake of last year's final. Subjected to shocking levels of abusive comments on the social media site, she has since spoken out about being dubbed 'a filthy slag' and declared herself horrified at the amount of misogynistic abuse she suffered. Writing in the Guardian newspaper shortly afterwards, she said: 'The criticism ranged from the gently cynical to the downright obnoxious, but as the series went on I noticed an increasing degree of personal vitriol and misogyny. 'So much of the criticism levelled at the bakers is gender-specific. My self-doubt has been simultaneously labelled pathetic, fake, attention-seeking and manipulative. Storm: Iain Watters was furious when his Baked Alaska went wrong and accused Diana Beard of sabotage . Suspicious: This shot of Mrs Beard apparently removing Mr Watter's effort from the freezer caused a storm . 'I have defended myself against accusations of being a ""filthy slag"" based solely on me being a woman on a TV screen.' A year on and its clear that, the naysayer's efforts notwithstanding, she still has big ambitions where baking is concerned and is gearing up for the launch of her first cookbook, Crumb - The Baking Book. She also remains unafraid to hit back at critics and has launched a broadside at feminists, who, she says, have no business telling other women that baking cupcakes is somehow unsisterly. 'The people who are most enthused by it [baking] are the younger generation,' she revealed in an interview published in today's Times newspaper. Accusation: Miss Tandoh was accused of flirting her way to last year's final by social media users . Outspoken: She has now decried activists who say baking cupcakes is somehow incompatible with feminism . 'People who were not raised on second-wave feminism, who don't have that instinctive reaction against domestic life. 'It's just something you do in your kitchen, nothing to do with your femininity or lack of, or success as a feminist. 'To love making cupcakes, for instance, doesn't make you a bad feminist.'","Tandoh, 22, says editors were 'if not malicious' then thoughtless .

"A toy penguin featured in the John Lewis Christmas Advert is already being sold on eBay for up to £500 - just one day after the commercial was released. Monty the Penguin, the star of this year's festive advert, flew off shelves and sold out online within hours of his screen debut yesterday, with parents forking out £95 for the cuddly toy. And many of those quick enough to buy Monty or his love interest, Mabel, are taking advantage of the penguins' popularity - by selling them online for more than three times the original price. Scroll down for video . Within hours of selling out on the John Lewis website, Monty and Mabel the penguins were listed on eBay for as much as £499 . Monty the penguin stars alongside actor Rhys Edwards, who plays Sam, in the heart warming advert . This year's two-minute festive commercial tells the story of seven-year-old Sam, played by seven-year-old Rhys Edwards, and his friend Monty. The boy gradually realises Monty is longing for a penguin companion. And so on Christmas morning Sam surprises Monty with the gift of a new penguin friend named Mabel. Throughout the advert Monty is a CGI penguin, but at the end it is revealed to be a stuffed toy - and for a few hours you could buy him and his girlfriend online in various sizes for between £12 and £95. Within hours the toys, which come in three sizes, had completely sold out online along with penguin-patterned pyjamas and cuff links. Variations of Monty and Mabel then began appearing online, with one eBay user charging an astonishing £499 for the pair. Others listed a pair of 35cm toys for £124, some £50 more than in stores. But, with more stock expected to become available today, a spokesman for John Lewis said customers eager to get their hands on a version of the toy need not worry. A set of the 25cm penguin - which costs £35 in stores - was being sold for more than double the price online . Another medium sized penguin was listed online for double the original price after the retailer sold out online . Within hours of the advert being released yesterday John Lewis sold out online. The retailer hopes to have more stock available today . 'The advert has proved very popular, as it always does. 'Hopefully we will get more stock out today for customers to order online. Monty and Mabel have not sold out in stores however,' a spokesman told MailOnline this morning. But while online shoppers clambered over their keyboards to buy the toy, those in stores were not convinced of its steep price tag. Dedi Chinanurakchart, a 21-year-old student in the Oxford Street store said: 'If it was a real penguin I probably would have bought it because I've always wanted one. 'Why is it so pricey? Is it stuffed with gold?' Malik Kydd, 19, also complained about the price: 'If that's the thing that they are promoting in the advert it shouldn't cost so much - because John Lewis is (usually) an accessible store for everybody.' Similarly, Daneika March, 24, and Natalie Baker, 38, who work at House of Fraser, enjoyed the family-focused feel to the ad, but Ms Baker said she would not be swayed by the £95 Monty toy. In the advert , a live penguin plays the role of Sam's best friend and sidekick in the boy's London home . After looking for love, Monty is given the best Christmas gift he could have hoped for when Sam brings him a female penguin . At the end of the two minute commercial it's revealed that Sam had been playing with a cuddly toy and not, as portrayed, a live penguin . 'I think it's £9.50 for a bear in John Lewis at the moment, so I wouldn't buy a £95 Monty.' Every year merchandise linked to the department store's seasonal advert has sold out within days of the hotly-anticipated commercial's release. Last year's theme, which featured The Hare and the Bear to a soundtrack of Lily Allen singing Keane's Somewhere Only We Know, saw alarm clocks and cuddly toys also pop up on eBay for more than double their original price. And in 2010, Ellie Goulding's Your Song racked up tens of millions of views after being played in the retailer's seasonal advert. Her rendition was so popular, it was chosen as the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge for their first dance after wedding in 2011.","Monty the penguin starred in retailer's Christmas advert released yesterday .

"These images show the joyful school days of former pupils at the Army Public School in Pakistan, where Taliban militants slaughtered 132 innocent children on Tuesday. In pictures obtained by the Mail Online, pupils can be seen happily smiling into the camera on a trip to the mountains, competing in a school sports day and learning in the library. They come from the school yearbook of Asad Liaqat, now a PhD student at America's esteemed Harvard University, who credits the school with giving him  the solid early education he required to move forward. Scroll down for video . Students from the Army Public School in Peshawar on a field trip to the mountains. Taliban militants butchered 132 pupils and nine teachers at the school on Tuesday . Watched by his pupils and teachers, a student leaps through a fiery hoop at a school sports day . Carrying swords and dressed in ceremonial costume, students perform for their parents in 1999 . After witnessing Tuesday's Taliban attack on his Alma mater, he wrote that he was left with nothing but questions about the atrocity which saw 132 innocent children and nine teachers viciously slain. 'Is there someone else left to blame, before we finally turn on ourselves,' he asked in a moving article, originally posted on a DAWN.com. 'Does it end where we begin or does it extend to within our souls?' It is a far cry from the happy days he spent in class 7E, where one 'library lesson' now takes on particular poignancy for him. After walking up a flight of stairs, through wood-paneled doors into a 'library that was too dark and cold,' he recalled sitting back in a comfortable chair and reading book, the name of which is long forgotten. With the 'forbidding librarian' looking on, he was drawn into the story about a soldier trying to escape from enemy territory back into his own. 'It was deathly cold,' Liaqat said. 'But the soldier could not ask for shelter. Instead, when he got tired, he would lie on the ground and will himself to believe that it was warm. Legs crossed, students sit at a singing competition held at the school. Many of the dead in the recent Taliban attack were of a similar age .

It will take days to clean up the carnage at the school (right) which was once attended by Asad Liaqat (right) who provided the pictures. He is now studying for his PhD at America's Harvard University . 'It worked for him. Even in the crippling cold, he could use the power of his mind to believe it was warm and that it would all be fine.' Around 13-years later he feared, 'some child would be sitting on that same chair, willing himself to believe that the cold in his attacker's heart would turn to warmth.' 'Maybe, after getting shot, he would have spent a few moments thinking about the warmth of his mother's embrace,' he said. Liaqat also recalled the school's auditorium where military spokesman, Major General Asim Bajwa said the attackers began their killing spree by shooting randomly at the students. Over 100 bodies were recovered there after the attack. 'Reports state that all their moves were calculated,' he said, questioning where the Taliban attackers had entered the room simultaneously or left any of them unguarded. There were five exits, four on either side and one at the back, he added. 'The one at the back would have been the best one for a quick exit,' he explained. 'Run across a few feet of concrete, past the chalking of quotes attributed to Quaid-e-Azam (Pakistan's founder), down a dozen steps, and into the trees.' Those trees, which he could see from his classroom, were within school walls, but nonetheless provided a handy hiding place, away from his teachers' prying eyes. 'Sometimes, to skip class, or sometimes in break-time, we would walk into the stretch of what I thought of as woods, lining the back wall of the school,' he said. 'We would crack silly jokes and look for interesting objects left behind by others as if we were scavenging in a forest,' he added. 'When a member of the staff saw us, we would be summoned back to class.' Nightmare scene: The bloody school auditorium where at least 100 bodies were found. Liaqat said there were five exits, four on either side and one at the back . Shoes lie among blood on the auditorium floor, where pupils were having a First Aid lecture before the massacre unfolded . Pools of dried blood is splattered across the floor, amid broken and knocked-over chairs . Books and note paper litter the floor of the school, dropped as children ran for their lives . Now he hopes those trees provided cover to pupils from the Taliban, but he said that from time to time their hiding place would be cut back or down. He also feared that the children's bright green uniforms may have allowed the Taliban militants to spot them but he said: 'Sometimes in the winter months there would be fog.' He also hoped that the clean up operation will be thorough enough for those who survived. 'Months from now, when another kid walks into the trees to look for interesting objects left behind by others, will they find a pencil sharpener, a chewed-up pencil, a pack of gum they weren't allowed to chew in class,' he asked. 'Will there be dried blood on these objects? How much care will be taken to remove these traces of blood?' If he wasn't looking out at the trees, Liaqat could also see a small canal from his beloved classroom, which ran parallel to the main road outside the school. 'There was a period of one or two weeks when we would see soldiers standing on either side of the canal, knee-deep in mud, clearing out the excess deposits, 'Bhal Safai', they called it,' he said. Harrowing: A blood-splattered doorway leading to an auditorium at the school in Peshawar, with spectacles on the floor belonging to one of the victims of the massacre . The fanatics used suicide vests and grenades in the attack, which left debris strewn across the floors . 'I remember thinking our soldiers must not have a lot else to do if they were clearing out canals,' he added. 'How long will it take them now to clear out the blood and the insides of children strewn all over the school?' He feared some of those bodies would be found in the canteen, where 'the samosas were usually soggy but there was something wonderful about the chutney that I have not seen replicated elsewhere.' It was so good he made his mother try some at a parent, teacher meeting but 'she was not impressed,' telling him it was 'too watery and probably really unhealthy.' Those children caught in the canteen by the Taliban 'would probably not have survived,' he said. 'It was too open. There was no place to hide. After the bell rung at the end of the day, he said he would past the main administrative block towards the school's car park. 'I would often encounter some teachers and students praying on straw mats strewn on the grass in front of the senior school block,' he recalled. 'There would be about 10-15 people, and my Islamiat teacher was usually one of them.' 'His head was always tilted slightly to the left. For him, probably a marker of added involvement and concentration in the prayer. For me, an unnecessary display of piety. A soldier surveys the damage in the school, as books and paper lie among debris in one of the corridors . Renowned Pakistani journalist, Wajahat S. Khan finds the devastation at the Army Public School hard to take . He added: 'I wonder if he still taught at the school. I wonder if he still tilted his head to the left when he prayed. I wonder if the tilt saved his life today. I wonder if the lack of a tilt cost the others on the prayer mats their lives.' Eerily, Liaqat would also walk home past a graveyard, adjacent to the school, which some reports have suggested the attackers scaled the wall of to get in. 'I remember wondering what it would be like to visit the graveyard as someone whose loved one was buried in it,' he said. 'I do not remember there being a lot of empty space in that graveyard. Thirteen years of urban sprawl have happened since. Will there be enough space for the bodies, small and big? When will we run out of space?' While holding the Taliban attackers responsible for the attack, he said: 'When we do go beyond single incidents, we go for neat, comfortable narratives. 'Russian invasion in Afghanistan. American funding of Mujahideen. The Army's games in Afghanistan and Kashmir. Indian infiltration. Saudi money. Poverty. Lack of education. Lack of development. Apathetic politicians. Insensitive middle classes.' Where do we start and where do we stop, he asked. 'Perhaps monsters are created because we need a visualisation of the evil that our minds cannot capture,' he said. 'Monsters are useful because they distance blame from ourselves. 'Monsters are simple, neat and horrific,' he added. 'There is no need for nuance. Evil is useful because if evil exists then good does too, and we embody the good because we define the evil.' 'Now we will mourn for three days,' he said. 'Then, we will stop mourning. We forget our own 9/11's (there have been too many). How can we expect anyone else to remember?'","Pupils at the Army Public School can be seen learning and having fun .

"They had rehearsed for weeks. Their halos shone. So, knowing a very proud mummy was somewhere in the audience, the children stepped up for their big moment… . And in walked a policeman demanding the nativity play be stopped, for the grave offence of bad parking. With little regard for Christmas spirit – or the nerves of small wise men and shepherds, never mind Mary – he ordered parents to move their cars, which he said were blocking the pavements outside and stopping patients parking at a doctor’s surgery. Put your halos up! PC Paul Baker, circled, interrupts the show at Redehall Preparatory School's nativity play . 'Petty': PC Baker refuted claims that he was heavy handed and said he carried out his duty and that there was nothing else he could have done . So as the play restarted, some parents . were forced to miss their little one’s starring role, instead trudging . down the road to shift their vehicles. Yesterday . PC Paul Baker was accused of ‘petty meddling’ and being ‘heavy-handed’ for interrupting the nativity play, performed by children from Redehall . Preparatory School in Smallfield, Surrey. The . play, Tinsel And Tea Towels, a humorous take on the traditional . nativity scene, was held at the centenary hall in Burstow, near Reigate, . on Monday night. An uncle . of one of the pupils at the £4,860-a-year school, who asked not to be . named, said: ‘The play had been on for 15 minutes when the policeman . walked in and stopped it. ‘Most . of the parents were shocked as they thought someone had committed a . serious crime. They thought they were going to be arrested. Regretful parking: Many parents were upset as they missed their children performing in the Redehall Prepatory School nativity play as they had to move their cars . ‘He said, “Excuse me, I have to stop . the show as some people have parked in a bad location near the doctors’ surgery. Please park down the road and walk back to the hall.” ‘At . this stage, everyone laughed as they had all thought that someone was . about to be arrested. He then stayed until people started to go and move . their cars. ‘He left after . saying sorry for stopping the play. The play then restarted even though . some parents missed it. I think everyone was really shocked that the . policeman had stopped the play because of bad parking.’ He . said some of the parents claimed they had received parking tickets. But . PC Baker said he had only issued one ‘warning’ ticket. 'No Parking': The play was held at the Centenary Village Hall, pictured, in Smallfield, Surrey . Move thy car: When the car park outside the Village hall, left, was full, parents had to park their cars on Wheelers road, right, to which PC Baker objected . The . uncle added: ‘It’s petty meddling and it was a heavy-handed response to . what was really not that big a deal.’ But PC Baker claims the bad . parking was a ‘safety hazard’, explaining he had been on foot patrol . when two residents stopped him and complained about it. Of the play, he said: ‘They’d just finished a song and it was near the opening of the play, but there was nothing else I could have done really. ‘I didn’t go in there sort of spelling . out the law and saying you must do this, wagging my finger or anything . like that. It was quite low-key. ‘I eased in and said, “Look, I don’t like doing this, sorry to interrupt, but there is a safety issue here. You can’t park on the pavement; it’s not acceptable. ‘If you can take this opportunity now to remove those cars. And most people did.’ He added: ‘It wasn’t heavy-handed in any sort of shape or form. 'It was just a nice, gentle typical neighbourhood police officer response really. ‘There was a lack of understanding, I think. Not from everyone, from some people, thinking well, what’s the problem. ‘They couldn’t quite grasp that, yeah, you’re parked on the pavement and people have to walk on the road it’s a safety issue.’ He added: ‘If I hadn’t done anything, I’d have got more complaints from the residents than I’d get from a few parents. The majority were supportive.’ The headmistress of Redehall Preparatory School declined to comment.","PC Paul Baker interrupted show to ask parents to move their parked cars .

"In 200 million years the Earth will look very different, with the latest research predicting that a supercontinent called Amasia will form right over the North Pole, and not over the centre of Africa, as previously thought. North and South America will crunch together, with the Caribbean Sea and Arctic Ocean disappearing, while Asia will join the Americas, according to a study by Yale University scientists. ‘After those water bodies close, we’re on our way to the next supercontinent,’ said lead researcher Ross Mitchell. ‘You’d have the Americas meeting Eurasia practically at the North Pole.’ SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Amasia: The present-day Arctic Ocean and Caribbean Sea will vanish as North and South America fuse . The results of the study were published this week in Nature, with the paper explaining that the formation of Amasia is between 50 and 200 million years away. The Yale researchers used a process called orthoversion to arrive at their conclusions. According to this, each succeeding supercontinent forms 90 degrees from the geographic centre of its ancient predecessor. The new theory contrasts with the standard theories about supercontinent formation, introversion and extroversion, which hold that supercontinents form either 0 or 180 degrees away from the geographic centre of the previous supercontinent. Under these earlier theories, the Atlantic Ocean will disappear and the next supercontinent will form with a centre more or less in the same spot as the last supercontinent’s centre, present-day Africa. Alternately, the Pacific Ocean will disappear and the next supercontinent will form with a centre on the opposite side of the globe. Mitchell and colleagues arrived at the new theory after an extensive analysis of the magnetism of ancient rocks. After each historical supercontinent assembled, it underwent a series of back-and-forth rotations around a stable axis along the equator. From one supercontinent to the next, the axes were offset from each other by about 90 degrees, the Yale team showed  - consistent with orthoversion, but not with either introversion or extroversion. ‘This kind of analysis gives us a way to arrange continents in both latitude and longitude, providing a better understanding in patterns of biological dispersal and the dynamics of Earth's deep interior,’ said Yale doctoral student Taylor M. Kilian, the study’s second author. The most recent supercontinent, Pangea (which is Greek for ‘All Lands’), formed about 300 million years ago with Africa at its centre. It began breaking apart into the seven continents of today with the birth of the Atlantic Ocean about 100 million years later. Researchers believe Pangea is the third or fourth supercontinent in Earth’s history. Its immediate predecessors were Rodinia - which formed about 1 billion years ago - and Nuna, which formed about 1.8 billion years ago. The idea of continental drift was introduced by German scientist Alfred Wegener in 1912, to explain how the shape of Earth’s countries looked suspiciously like jigsaw pieces that would fit together. The Earth’s surface is formed from seven major and several minor tectonic plates that wander around at speeds varying from a few millimetres to two centimetres a year, the same pace that a human nail grows. It’s the friction caused by plates grinding against each other that causes earthquakes.",It was previously thought that the next supercontinent would form over the centre of Africa .

'We would go into shock': Jay and Kateri Schwandt are waiting until the birth to find out whether they are having a boy or a girl but admitted that they aren't expecting their baby boy streak to be broken . While husband Jay said the couple are just 'hoping for a healthy baby', he admitted that he would love to see the effect of adding a girl into a household with 12 boys. 'I've experienced all the boy stuff,' he said. 'As long as we are having all these children, it would be really neat to experience the other side.' The couple welcomed their twelfth son, Tucker, to the world on August 4, 2013. Their eldest son Ty is now 22. 'The stuff that goes on in this house is all-boy - roughhousing and wrestling,' Jay added. 'If there was a little girl in there, I assume it would be different.' Perhaps surprisingly, Kateri, after being the sole female in the family for more than two decades, said she would lean toward having one more boy. 'A little girl would be neat to have in the house, but a little boy kind of takes the pressure off,' she said. 'We know what we are doing. Why change things up?'

"It is one of the most eye-popping feats of modern architecture in the world. The hyper-modern ship-like Louis Vuitton art museum opened its doors on the edge of the Bois de Boulogne park, on Monday in a glitzy ceremony attended by French president François Hollande. Designed by architect Frank Gehry, known for designing the Walt Disney Concert Hall in Los Angeles and the Guggenheim Museum building in Bilbao, Spain, the striking structure boasts 12 glass sails which billow around the museum's main building - nicknamed 'the iceberg'. The Louis Vuitton Foundation, nicknamed the 'iceberg' was designed by architect Frank Gehry, known for designing the Walt Disney Concert Hall in Los Angeles and the Guggenheim Museum building in Bilbao, Spain . The edifice has been thirteen years in the making and is funded by France's richest man, Bernard Arnault, who heads up the LVMH luxury goods empire. Gehry said he was inspired by the lightness of late 19th-century glass and garden architecture. The 85-year-old architect explained that he wanted to 'design, in Paris, a magnificent vessel symbolising the cultural calling of France'. La Ville-Lumière: The business district of La Defense is viewed from a balcony at the Louis Vuitton Foundation . A feat of modern architecture: Twelve glass sails surround the museum's asymmetric main building . 'It is a very unusual building. I have never designed anything exactly like it,' he said on the foundation's website, which describes it as 'an iconic building for the 21st century'. Inside, eleven galleries provide 3,850 square metres  of exhibition space to house shows and a permanent collection, which will include works borrowed from Arnault's personal collection. The project was undertaken by 100 engineers assembled by famed Los Angeles-based architect Gehry and a total of 3,000 workers. Impressive: The £80million building has 11 gallery spaces and has been compared to a giant sailboat . The privately owned museum is open to the public this week, but will be donated to the city of Paris in 50 years . French media reports say the project's initial price tag of approximately 100 million euros - around £80 million -  has been surpassed. The privately owned museum will open to the public on October 27, but will be donated to the city of Paris in 50 years. From the inside, visitors will have views of the  surrounding Jardin d'Acclimatation in the Bois de Boulogne, as well as the Eiffel Tower and La Defense business centre.

"A grandfather died of a stroke after an ambulance took over an hour to reach him - before hospital staff turned him away because they were about to go home for the weekend. Retired vet John Mallalieu, 89, died in December last year after a call handler missed two opportunities to send an ambulance to his home when his wife called 999, an inquest heard. He was just minutes from treatment on December 6 last year when an ambulance was diverted 14 miles because staff at a specialist stroke centre were not accepting new patients after 5pm. It took nearly two hours to get John Mallelieu (pictured, left) to a hospital after his wife Ruth (right) phoned 999 following a series of errors by emergency services . Mr Mallalieu, of Caunton, Nottinghamshire, was turned away from King's Mill Hospital in nearby Mansfield because a consultant in charge was going home for the weekend, the hearing was told. The ambulance was forced to battle though Friday rush hour traffic which took an hour before finally arriving at Nottingham City Hospital. Tragically, he died 16 days later in hospital on December 22. An inquest heard about a catalogue of delays in getting Mr Mallalieu to hospital and a lack of communication. East Midlands Ambulance Service dispatch officer Jonathan Schofield told Nottingham Coroner's Court that it had been an extremely busy day in charge of 38 crews - more than normal. He told the court that he was nearing the end of a 12-hour shift, in which had only been able to take two short toilet breaks, when he took the call from Mr Mallalieu's wife Ruth, 85. Mrs Mallalieu phoned 999 before 4pm on Friday, December 6 last year, but by the time an ambulance had taken her husband to a hospital, specialist staff had 'gone home', an inquest heard . The inquest heard a new call handling system had been introduced and Mr Schofield admitted he missed opportunities to get an ambulance to the scene quickly. Mrs Mallalieu had dialled 999 from the couple's home at 3.59pm on December 6 after her husband showed signs of a stroke. The call was immediately categorised as a 'Red 2' case, the most severe, and a paramedic was sent out nine minutes later in a fast response car. But Mr Schofield admitted it was a further nine minutes to dispatch an ambulance crew and when he finally did he was told the crew had already been sent to another emergency. The court heard that if he had checked earlier, two ambulances would have been free. He waited 45 minutes to check again if there was an ambulance free and, when one was available, it did not arrive until 5.20am - an hour and 20 minutes after Mrs Mallalieu's call. Mr Schofield was following a new pilot scheme introduced just four days earlier. He said: 'It was a very busy shift for all of us. I would say this new role increased demand quite significantly.' First-responder paramedic Wendy Coghill phoned for an ambulance just 15 minutes after arriving at the house. Nottinghamshire Coroner Marian Casey said: 'In that 45 minutes, am I mistaken in thinking nothing was happening about pursuing a double-crewed ambulance for John Mallalieu?' Mr Schofield replied: 'I would say you are correct.' East Midlands Ambulance Service (EMAS) and Sherwood Forest Hospitals NHS Trust issued an apology to Mr Mallalieu's devastated widow following the blunders. They blamed the errors on 'organisational issues' at the 999 control centre but admitted the retired vet had been 'failed' by the NHS. Ambulance bosses also agreed there were 'unacceptable delays' in transferring Mr Mallalieu to the right hospital for treatment and claimed lessons had been learned from the tragedy. The ambulance was turned away from King's Mill Hospital in nearby Mansfield (pictured) because a consultant in charge was going away for the weekend, the hearing was told . Staff received a call from the paramedic control centre at 5.45pm telling them his ambulance was 20 minutes away - meaning he would arrive at 6.05pm. Because the unit closed at 6pm with last patient admissions being officially 5pm, the crew were ordered to divert to Nottingham City Hospital. Consultant Jill Woodhead, who was on duty at King's Mill Hospital, told the hearing it would 'have been wrong' to accept Mr Mallalieu as a patient. She said: 'My understanding was that the service we had ran from 8am until 5pm on Monday to Friday and out of those hours patients were to be sent to Nottingham [City Hospital]. 'The reason for the cut off is medical, and not for convenience. 'There is a need for a cut off so that people are clear and there isn't a delay in treatment from going to the wrong hospital.' Dr Jill Woodhead (left) said the hospital had a 'cut-off' time of 5pm after which patients could not be admitted. Dr Anoja Rajapaske (right) said she knew Nottingham hospital had said Mr Mallalieu should be treated at King's Mill but told them he should still be sent there . Dr Woodhead added: 'I wasn't aware if the stroke team was even still at our hospital after 5pm. 'It wouldn't have mattered to me if the patient had come here because I was in all evening, but it would have been wrong for us to allow that.' The inquest heard a frantic phone call took place between Nottingham City and King's Mill hospital, with both insisting the other should treat Mr Mallalieu. Dr Anoja Rajapaske, consultant physician at the hospital, told the inquest: 'We have the 5pm cut off for admissions so we can get everything done by 6pm. 'But this was the first time we had someone seeking admission after 5pm so it was the first time we needed arrange plans with Nottingham City Hospital.' Coroner Mairin said to her: 'You knew that the ward at Nottingham City Hospital had plainly refused to treat the man.' Dr Rajapaske replied: 'I did. But I would have treated him had he come in after 6pm because I was still on site. I left the site about 6:15pm.' Laura King, another nurse in the A&E department of King's Mill hospital, took a call from the paramedic control centre at about 5.40pm, which said the ambulance with Mr Mallalieu in would arrive at King's Mill in about 20 minutes. She accidentally accepted that Mr Mallalieu could come to the hospital but was forced to ring the paramedic control room back immediately after her consultant told her that the patient would arrive after the cut off point of 5pm. Miss King said: 'Our consultant was right next to me, so I told her the symptoms when I got off the phone, and she said it would be too late. 'As soon as she said that I phoned back the ambulance service. 'While waiting for them to pick up I remember thinking it was taking a long time for them to answer and I was getting agitated. 'Once they picked up for the second call at 5.45pm, I was then transferred to someone else and I expected it to be the ambulance crew, but it was just another control officer. 'I explained the situation again and they said they would tell the ambulance crew. 'I said taking the patient to Nottingham City Hospital was the best option, but if he couldn't be accommodated there then he could be brought to us. 'I was not aware of the original call to my colleague at 4.25pm.' Coroner Casey suggested to Miss King that it may have been 'prudent to tell the stroke department at that point' that the patient was trying to be re-directed to Nottingham City Hospital, but Miss King had not done so. The inquest, which is expected to last five days, continues. Since publication of this article, we are happy to clarify that the coroner made it clear in her summing up that there was no evidence that the outcome for mortality  would in fact  have been any different for Mr Mallalieu regardless of admission time.","John Mallalieu, 89, suffered stroke at around 4pm on Friday, December 6 .

"Wonga is to write off £220million in debts of 330,000 customers after the company admitted it has made loans to people who could not afford to repay them, it was revealed today. The move by the pay-day lender comes after an agreement with the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) that requires it to make significant changes to its business immediately. The review means that about 330,000 customers who are currently in excess of 30 days in arrears will have the balance of their loan written off and will owe Wonga nothing. Pay-day lender: Wonga is to write off the debts of 330,000 customers whose loans would not have been made under new affordability criteria being introduced . Approximately 45,000 customers who are up to 29 days in arrears will be asked to repay their debt without interest and charges and will be given an option of paying off their debt over an extended period of four months. Wonga's new chairman Andy Haste said: 'When I joined Wonga I was made aware of concerns the FCA had already expressed around affordable lending, concerns which I shared. 'I committed to ensuring our lending is conducted in a responsible and transparent manner, delivering the best outcomes for our customers. 'I also said this would lead to a tightening of Wonga’s lending criteria and we will now be accepting far fewer applications from new and existing customers. 'We want to ensure we only lend to those who can reasonably afford the loan in question and during my review, it became clear to me that this has unfortunately not always been the case. 'I agreed with the concerns expressed by the FCA and as a consequence of our discussions we have committed to taking these actions.' New strategy: Wonga put an end to its puppet adverts to prevent young people being lured into debt . Customers should continue to make payments unless they are told to stop by the firm. New chairman: Andy Haste said he wants Wonga's lending to be 'conducted in a responsible and transparent manner' From today, the company has introduced new interim lending criteria and is working to put in place a new permanent platform as soon as possible. Wonga said it would be accepting significantly fewer loan applications and that some existing customers would no longer be able to use the service. Mr Haste added: 'It’s clear to me that the need for change at Wonga is real and urgent. Our regulator is determined to improve standards in consumer credit and I share that determination. 'There is much to do in order to make Wonga a sustainable and accepted business, and today’s announcement is a significant step forward in that process.' Wonga will be contacting all customers by October 10 to notify them if they will be included in the redress programme. When it took over regulation of consumer credit in April, the FCA requested information from Wonga which subsequently suggested it was not taking adequate steps to assess customers' ability to meet repayments. FCA director of supervision Clive Adamson said: ‘We are determined to drive up standards in the consumer credit market and it is disappointing that some firms still have a way to go to meet our expectations. ‘This should put the rest of the industry on notice - they need to lend affordably and responsibly. ‘It is absolutely right that Wonga's new management team has acted quickly to put things right for their customers after these issues were raised by the FCA.’ The total cost to Wonga of writing off loans and not imposing interest and other charges will be £255million. This is made up of £220million lost through writing off the debts incurred by 330,000 of its customers and a further £35million lost by not imposing certain fees and charges and not making debt collections. Most of the £220million has been accounted for already by Wonga and it expects the £35million cost to feature in its accounting for 2014. The total number of customers who will have their loans either completely written off or who will see some charges dropped comes to around one fifth of the 1.8million people who have ever taken out a loan with Wonga. Compared: While Wonga's revenues were up by £5million in 2013, their costs increased by almost £50million . Wonga's profits more than halved last year after it racked up £18.8million in costs relating to a scandal over fake legal letters. Archbishop: Justin Welby in Belfast today . Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby has said the lending and savings industry should be a good servant, not a bad master. He welcomed Wonga's decision to write off debt as an effort to put right some of the things that have gone wrong in the past. But the head of the Anglican Church said the major issue was to create a reformed financial system. ‘The big issue is to create a financial system that gives access to the poor and hope for the poorest in our lands, to be able to flourish and develop and have proper access to finance, not just for loans but for savings. For lives in which finance is a good servant, not a bad master.’ Mr Welby has been a high-profile opponent of pay day lenders. But it was revealed earlier this year that the Church of England had £75,000 indirectly invested in Wonga out of investments totalling £5.2billion. The revelation came after the archbishop received widespread publicity when he told Errol Damelin, Wonga chief executive, that the Church of England wanted to drive the pay-day lenders out of business through the creation of credit unions. During a visit to Belfast today he said: ‘I welcome anything in which the pay day lenders are involved in seeking to put right some of the things that have gone wrong in the past, which has left people burdened by debt that should never have been there, caught up in things which sometimes they did not fully see what they were getting into.’ The Church of England, which claims to have a strong ethical investment policy that explicitly bans companies involved in pay day lending, had invested in Accel Partners, the US venture capital firm that led Wonga's 2009 fundraising. Mr Welby said in July that he was irritated and embarrassed that Church funds were being funnelled into Wonga and said he would seek to remedy the situation. The company has said it expects it will be ‘smaller and less profitable’ in the near term as it carries out the task of cleaning up its reputation. In June, Wonga was ordered to pay compensation of £2.6 million by the FCA after sending threatening legal letters from fake law firms to 45,000 customers. The regulator said Wonga had been guilty of ‘unfair and misleading debt collection practices’ by creating fake companies to pressure struggling customers into paying their bills. The seven-year-old firm, which unlike many payday lenders has its roots in the UK rather than the United States, has around one million customers and a default rate of around 7 per cent on its loans. Wonga is one of several payday lenders which recently signed up to a new real-time information sharing service, helping it to make more accurate decisions about who to lend money to. Going ahead, Wonga plans to overhaul the image it presents to the public, especially through its advertising, in a way that cuts the risk of it inadvertently attracting the very young or vulnerable. Wonga's cuddly, elderly puppets disappeared from TV screens in July, as Mr Haste said he was ‘very aware’ of criticism of its marketing campaign. The firm has no immediate plans to launch a new advertising drive. Which? executive director Richard Lloyd said: ‘Wonga's announcement is better late than never for struggling borrowers but it's clearly a result of the regulator taking a tougher approach. The FCA must keep payday lenders on a tight leash. 'We have long called for more responsible affordability checks and better advice. The next step must be a clamp down on excessive fees and charges across the board to show lenders that the FCA will continue to clean up the credit market.’ And Gillian Guy, chief executive of Citizens Advice, said: ‘A lack of checks by lenders is setting a debt trap for borrowers. People are left struggling to make ends meet as high interest rates and charges quickly ramp up debts. ‘The FCA is right to come down hard on Wonga after it found it had poor affordability processes but it is not only lender guilty of this - it is a widespread problem within the industry.’ And Dr Emmanuel Adegbite from Durham University Business School said: ‘While companies like Wonga may appear to provide a useful service to people caught up in serious financial difficulty, the help they provide must be ethical and responsible. This must be underpinned by a fair and robust internal governance framework, which protects the vulnerable. 'Although Wonga’s latest move was voluntary, the rest of the industry may have to alter their behaviour more proactively to prevent the hammer of regulation from the FCA falling at their doors.’","Wonga admits it made loans to people who couldn't afford to repay them .

"Scott Kelly went on the run after being released on licence from his jail sentence for attempted murder . A violent criminal who went on the run was caught after police tracked him down using a picture of a sunset which he posted on Facebook. Scott Kelly spent seven years in prison for attempted murder, but fled last October after he was released on probation. He travelled to Spain, where he posted photos of himself relaxing in restaurants and drinking with friends. Police studied the photographs but could find no clues to identify the fugitive’s location – until he posted one picture of a sunset over the sea. After studying the palm tree-lined promenade they identified the coastline as Alicante and informed authorities in Spain. Spanish police then spotted Kelly driving around the Costa Blanca resort last month and arrested him. The runaway was held on a European Arrest Warrant, extradited back to the UK this week and has now been returned to prison. Kelly, 33, was jailed in March 2005 for attempted murder after he stabbed Stephen Rank in the back during a row in a bar in Exeter. He served seven years but was released on a five-year licence in April last year and ordered to stay in a bail hostel. However in October last year, he defied the terms of his probation by fleeing the hostel and vanishing overseas to enjoy a skiing trip before moving on to Spain. Police managed to track him down after he posted this picture of the seafront in Alicante, Spain . The picture was one of a number Kelly posted on Facebook showing his trip around Europe while  on the run . His whereabouts remained a mystery until a joint operation between police, Interpol and the National Crime Agency located the crucial photo ‘intelligence’. Detective Inspector Paul Fell, from organised crime unit Zephyr, said: ‘It quickly became clear that he had breached his licence. 'We were able to point the Spanish police in the right direction. 'They don’t like having British criminals living on the Spanish coast believing they are immune from the authorities so they were more than helpful and were very keen to detain him.’ He added: ‘I am sure Scott Kelly went to Spain and was living the high life thinking he was untouchable. Many more may feel the same – but they are not.’ A Devon and Cornwall Police spokesman said: ‘It became clear during the investigation that Kelly had an utter disregard for the judicial system and the conditions imposed by the probation service, and felt he was untouchable in Spain. ‘The extradition demonstrates that the force will work with law enforcement agencies to ensure that people who feel that they are above the law will be returned to the UK to serve their sentence.’ Police said he showed an 'utter disregard' for the legal system by posting photos of his life as a fugitive . The photos even included a picture of Kelly's skiing trip before he headed to Spain's Costa Blanca .","Criminal convicted of attempted murder went on run when freed on licence .

"The happiest dog owners in Britain have a pet Yorkshire Terrier, research has found. The study of pet owners found a typical owner of the breed laughs ten times a day - more than any other - and describe themselves as the happiest people.

The 24-year-old Liverpool FC footballer, who is devoted to his black Labrador Lucky and regularly posts pictures of the dog on social media, split last month from his fiancée Fanny Neguesha. The study of 2,000 dog owners also found that the lowest paid dog owners tend to be Great Dane lovers, who take home a typical salary of £35,000.

And dog lovers wanting a long and happy relationship should look no further than buying a pug, because 54 per cent of people with one are married. In contrast, Britons with bulldogs are the most likely to be in a failing relationship. One in 12 who own one are looking to break up with their partner, the study found.

"A 15-year-old army cadet who was burned with a makeshift flamethrower after selling poppies in the street has been left 'very upset' over the attack, according to his mother. Schoolboy Callum Watkins suffered burns to his face after he was targeted by a stranger as he waited for a bus in his camouflage uniform after spending the day selling Remembrance Day poppies in Manchester city centre. The teenager had been selling poppies on behalf of the Royal British Legion on Saturday and was waiting to catch a bus home at 6pm when he was blasted in the face with a lit aerosol jet outside Manchester Art Gallery - less than 100 yards from the city's cenotaph. Scroll down for video . Army cadet Callum Watkins, 15, suffered burns in the unprovoked attack which happened as he waited at a bus stop in Manchester city centre after spending the day selling poppies for Remembrance Day (file picture) The schoolboy, who was wearing his camouflaged uniform, suffered minor burns to his face and singed hairs on his face and right forearm as he waited for a bus outside Manchester Art Gallery on Saturday (pictured) The attacker approached him holding an aerosol can and cigarette lighter before spraying the youngster with blazing fumes and walking off without saying a word. Callum suffered minor burns to his face and singed hairs on his face and right forearm. His mother Kirsty Sloan said he was 'very upset' by the incident and confirmed he was now recovering at home. She said: 'His face is burned and he is not very well. 'We just want whoever did this caught so that Callum can put it behind him.' Callum serves with the Levenshulme Detachment Duke of Lancaster's Cadet Regiment and Colour Sergeant Jackson requested maximum attendance at the drill hall last night to discuss cadet safety after the attack. Well-wisher Paolo D'angelo posted on the cadet's Facebook page: 'It's beyond being human attacking a soldier in the street (Lee Rigby RIP) but attacking a child! 'What kind of inhumane person would do such a thing. I hope the cadet makes a fully recovery and it doesn't deter him from selling poppies in the future.' Royal British Legion bosses condemned the attack and said: 'The  Legion is appalled to hear of this act of violence against one of our poppy collectors in Manchester. The offender, described as black or Asian, 5ft 8in tall and wearing a dark top, walked off from the bus stop in Manchester city centre without saying a word. Callum has been left 'very upset' over the attack (file picture) 'It is shocking that a young man who has dedicated his spare time as a cadet to supporting the Poppy Appeal could be targeted in this horrifying manner. 'We extend our sympathy and support to the cadet and his family and will be cooperating with the police investigation of this incident.' The attacker, who appeared to be under the influence of alcohol, was described as black or Asian, 5ft 8in tall and wearing a dark hooded top. He was last seen walking away from the bus stop by the Manchester Gallery opposite George Street around 6pm. Detective Inspector Liam Boden, of Greater Manchester Police, said: 'This is an absolutely appalling attack on a young man who was raising money to help remember all those who gave their lives fighting bravely for their country. 'At this stage of our inquiries, we're keeping an open mind as to what motivated the offender to commit such an act. 'Given the initial description we have of the offender, it may be that he was under the influence of something but whatever his motivation, his violent actions could have scarred this young man for life.' 'It is pure luck that he did not sustain more serious burns to his face and body. 'Understandably, both he and his family are in a state of total shock and cannot believe someone would do this. 'We need to find who ever is responsible for this crime and I would therefore appeal to anyone who has information.' He added: 'This happened at a very busy time in the city centre, near a main bus route, and there could be lots of people who saw this man staggering around.' Bill Daw, 89, was forced to sell poppies outside Morrisons supermarket in Taunton in temperatures of 14C . Morrisons later apologised to Mr Daw after the manager of the branch in Taunton, Somerset, suggested that the 89-year-old poppy seller buy a warmer coat because there was not space for him to  sell them inside . Meanwhile, supermarket chain Morrisons faced calls for a boycott last week after claims an 89-year-old war veteran was forced to sell poppies outside its store in the cold. Customer Veronica Roach said she was shopping in the Taunton branch when she became concerned about the elderly man – later identified as Burma veteran Bill Daw – when temperatures fell to around 14C. She said his hands were 'freezing' in the cold but when she challenged the manager, he told her there was no room for the Royal British Legion collector inside because of a promotional stand. He suggested Mr Daw should 'wear a warmer coat'. A store spokesman described the matter as a 'misunderstanding' and claimed Mr Daw had chosen to stand outside. But Morrisons was eventually forced to apologise after the story was reported in the press, and went viral on social media. A spokesman said: 'We are very sorry about how this misunderstanding has looked. We will of course donate to the British Legion, and will be making a special gift to both Veronica and our 89-year-old veteran. 'We spoke to the British Legion this morning and the store have removed a number of items in the foyer to enable them to be inside the store.' Mr Daw is the standard bearer for the Taunton branch of the Burma Star Association. As a 19-year-old private, he helped form a guard when the Japanese surrendered in Rangoon.

"Serial pest Peter Hore has been banned from attending the G20 summit in Brisbane after years of stirring up trouble and disrupting public events. The 54-year-old from Newcastle, north of Sydney, is one of just two people on the G20's Prohibited List and will not be allowed in Brisbane from November 8-17. Mr Hore had revealed he wanted to walk naked across Brisbane's Gateway Bridge when the world's leaders descended on the city this week, the Courier Mail reports. Scroll down for video . Serial pest Peter Hore is one of just two people on the G20's Prohibited List and will not be allowed in Brisbane from November 8-17 . But he claims he wouldn't have carried out the plan anyway because of an outstanding arrest warrant that could land him in jail. 'I'd be put straight into police custody if I went back,' he said. 'I'd be held on remand on a 2008 charge of resisting arrest, and probably be denied bail and spend two or three months in custody. Why would I go back?' NSW Police approached Mr Hore on Friday while he was busking in Newcastle to hand him a letter signed by Queensland's Commissioner of Police saying he wasn't welcome at the G20. He was also given a map outlining the specific zones he has been banned from. The now 54-year-old has a long history of interrupting public events. He was taken away by police in Brisbane in 2006 for disrupting a lingerie launch hosting by supermodel Sarah Murdoch . He carried cats and rode a tricycle onto the field ahead of the Newcastle Knights and Parramatta NRL game in 2006 . 'I think I should frame the letter, considering it's signed by Queensland's Commissioner of Police,' he said. Mr Hore has a long history of causing trouble and protesting. He infamously ran onto the racetrack at Flemington during the 1997 Melbourne Cup and invaded the Melbourne Cricket Ground in the same year to ruin Australia's hopes of qualifying for the World Cup against Iran. Australia had been leading 2-0 at the time, but after the disruption Iran scored two quick goals to level the score and knock Australia out of contention for the 1998 World Cup. The 54-year-old also made appearances at the funerals of INXS frontman Michael Hutchence and racing legend T J Smith. Mr Hore, pictured here leaving a Brisbane watch house, was arrested amid fears he would invade the first Ashes Test at the Gabba in 2006 . He has been banned from the G20 after revealing he wanted to walk naked across Brisbane's Gateway Bridge when the world's leaders descended on the city this week . He carried cats and rode a tricycle onto the field ahead of the Newcastle Knights and Parramatta NRL game in 2006. Just this year, Mr Hore stormed a corruption hearing at Sydney's Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC). A police officer reportedly suffered a bad cut to the head after he struck it on a table trying to subdue him. Mr Hore was charged in 2002 with assisting asylum seekers to escape from the Woomera Detention Centre . Dubbed the serial pest, Mr Hore said he wasn't aware of any planned protests at the G20 and claims he has given up protesting .

"England forwards Dylan Hartley and Courtney Lawes have both signed new contracts with Aviva Premiership champions Northampton, as revealed by Sportsmail on Tuesday night. Saints announced the deals among a raft of seven fresh contracts, with flanker Calum Clark, props Alex Waller, Ethan Waller and Gareth Denman, plus lock James Craig also putting pen to paper. Northampton hooker and captain Hartley, 28, had been linked with a possible move to French club Montpellier after next year's World Cup, but he will now remain with Saints, the club he joined in 2005. Dylan Hartley (left) had been linked with a big-money move to France but has signed a new contract . Courtney Lawes (centre) has established himself as first-choice England lock . Hartley has clocked up almost 200 first team appearances and won 61 England caps. The multiple contract announcement comes just three days before Saints tackle fierce East Midlands rivals Leicester in the Premiership, when Northampton will look to consolidate top spot, currently standing two points above Bath. 'We have a group that has shown time and again that they have the ability to compete at the highest level of club rugby, and retaining players is very important to us,' Northampton rugby director Jim Mallinder said. Versatile flanker Calum Clark has also been involved in the England set-up . 'The seven forwards that we have announced today are all good players already, but they still have the ability to improve. 'We are looking forward to seeing them develop further at Franklin's Gardens.' Hartley is currently Northampton's longest-serving player, while 27-year-old Lawes made his club debut in 2007 and is now established among the northern hemisphere's leading second-row forwards, with 36 caps to his name.

"Former jump jockey Graham Bradley says it is ‘outrageous’ of the BHA to suggest he does not feel remorse for previous disciplinary breaches as racing’s ruling body sent out a clear signal that they will continue to oppose him becoming a trainer. Details emerged on Tuesday of the case in which Bradley was found not guilty of operating as an ‘unlicensed trainer’ controlling his own horses while working for Lambourn trainer Brendan Powell. But the disciplinary panel flagged up ‘disturbing features’ that ‘may be found relevant by the Licencing Committee when it comes to decide upon Bradley’s training licence application. These included a ‘failure to recognise the seriousness of the misconduct which led to his disqualifications'. Former jump jockey Graham Bradley pictured at Stratford-upon-Avon racecourse in August 2013 . Bradley remains a hugely controversial figure who polarises opinion within the sport because of the five-year ban he received from the Jockey Club in 2002 for receiving money for tips from Brian Wright, a man subsequently sent to jail for 30 years after being exposed as one of Britain’s biggest drug dealers. But he says it is wrong to suggest he does not regret his past misdemeanors. Bradley said: ‘I had unreservedly apologised and said it on a number of occasions. They are obviously not believing the sincerity of my apology. ‘They seem to believe everyone else. I have been promised lots of horses from big owners and I want them to let me get on with my life. I can’t believe they don’t think I am remorseful for what I did in the past. Of course, I am. ‘I have publically said I am sorry and wrote them letters.’ Bradley lodged an application to train in May 2013. Bradley (right) poses with former Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson at Cheltenham in 1999 . The latest investigation, involving 12 horses which ran in 116 races and picked up 19 wins between October 2012 and May 2014, heard that Bradley had directly charged owners training fees and raceday expenses as well as taking a share of Powell’s prize money. But the panel, while conceding it was a ‘close run thing’ it concluded that Powell made the entries for the horses and supervised their work regimes – enough for the BHA not to have proven their case. BHA spokesman Robin Mounsey said: ‘We note that the Panel had significant concerns with Bradley’s conduct, which will be considered when determining his suitability to hold a licence.’ While plenty will applaud the BHA sticking to its hard line, Bradley has been found not guilty of the latest charge. Having this year granted jockey Fergal Lynch, who was banned for admitting he stopped a horse, a licence to ride, to continue to obstruct Bradley, who has paid the price for his misdemeanors, is a questionable line of action.","Former jockey Graham Bradley lodged an application to train last year .

"Owner Rich Ricci is planning a power-packed dual raid at Kempton on Boxing Day with Willie Mullins-trained duo Faugheen and Champagne Fever. As expected, Champagne Fever runs in the William Hill King George VI Chase but Ricci has revealed the Christmas Hurdle is his 'preferred target' for unbeaten Faugheen, winner of last season's Neptune Investment Novices' Hurdle at the Cheltenham Festival as well as being successful at Ascot last month. That potentially sets up an absorbing clash with Paul Nicholls-trained Fighting Fifth Hurdle winner Irving and, possibly, The New One if all goes well for him in Saturday's International Hurdle at Cheltenham. Christmas Hurdle is the 'preferred target' for unbeaten Faugheen . Ricci said: 'I have a lot of respect for Irving but the Christmas Hurdle seems a good race for us. That is my preferred target. 'Christmas at Leopardstown will be another re-match between Hurricane Fly and Jezki and I am not keen to take those guys on too quickly.' The King George will be a first try at three miles for Champagne Fever, the 2013 Supreme Novices' Hurdle winner. He won the Clonmel Oil Chase on his comeback last month and Ricci revealed the Mullins-team are keen to have him as fresh as possible for the King George after learning from his defeat in last season's Arkle Chase at Cheltenham.

Ricci said: 'I had a conversation with Ruby (Walsh) and Willie afterwards and they thought they had done too much work with him. 'This season we have kept him fresher. He is certainly bred to stay and we have every hope he will win. He is in great form.' Meanwhile, Charlie Morlock, assistant to trainer Nicky Henderson, says there is growing optimism that Simonsig could make the race after his long absence. Morlock said: 'There is still work to do and it is an upward curve but if there are no more kinks along the way there is a good chance.'","Champagne Fever to run in the William Hill King George VI Chase .

"A warehouse in Swindon has installed a 'hole-in-the-ground' toilet to cater for foreign workers, according to reports. Employees from eastern Europe apparently prefer squatting while using the loo, prompting managers to order a new toilet to match their requirements. Bosses at the DHL warehouse are also said to be infuriated after workers broke the traditional loo seat by squatting on it. Continental: A squat toilet has been installed in a DHL warehouse in Swindon (file photo) The distribution centre in Swindon, which transports goods for B&Q, has spent thousands of pounds on the new facility, according to The Sun. Managers had previously installed signs instructing employees not to squat on the toilet. A source told the paper: 'Staff have been fed up with the toilet seats breaking and workers leaving a mess.' DHL did not respond to a request for comment. Warning: Managers apparently installed signs instructing employees how to sit on the toilet . Squat toilets are rarely seen in the UK despite their popularity in many other countries around the world. British tourists in France frequently complain that only 'hole-in-the-ground' facilities are available in restaurants and service stations. And in some Asian countries, such as India and Japan, British-style toilets were virtually unknown until relatively recently. However, squat loos may be set to gain in popularity in Britain, thanks to doctors who claim that the squatting posture brings health benefits. Some medics believe that squatting while going to the toilet is a more 'natural' position, and could protect against disease.","Bosses at DHL warehouse in Swindon have ordered a new squat toilet .

"MPs have voted to ban abortions on the grounds of gender amid growing Parliamentary concern over sex-selective terminations. They voted 181 to one to make abortions based on gender illegal, saying the current law had led to ‘widespread confusion’ about what was allowed and what was not. But the ban is unlikely to come into effect, because the government is not behind the change. MPs said the current law on abortion had led to 'widespread confusion' about what was allowed and what was not . The only MP who voted against the sex-selective abortions ban was Glenda Jackson, the former actress and Labour MP for Hampstead and Kilburn. During today’s Commons debate, Conservative MP Fiona Bruce insisted the law needs to be clarified to make it explicit to doctors that they cannot terminate pregnancies because of the sex of the unborn child. The MP for Congleton said ministers could not wait to take action until official figures highlighted a ‘national skewing’ in the number of girls born compared to boys. She said urgent clarification of the law was needed, because the BMA and abortion provider BPAS argue that sex-selective abortion is not illegal under the 1967 Act. ‘We cannot sit idly by as they contradict ministers over a practice that the government states is illegal,’ she said. ‘Urgent clarification from this House is needed.’ MPs overwhelmingly backed her desire to bring forward the Abortion (Sex-Selection) Bill, which she introduced on behalf of a cross-party group that included 11 other female MPs. Moving her Bill, Ms Bruce said: ‘Sex-selective abortions are happening in the UK and there is widespread confusion over the law. That is why this Bill is needed. Conservative MP Fiona Bruce has called for sex-selective abortions to be made specifically illegal . ‘It's extremely straightforward. It merely clarifies that nothing in section one of the Abortion Act 1967 allows a pregnancy to be terminated on the grounds of the sex of the unborn child. ‘It is a shame this clarification is needed. Successive health ministers and even the Prime Minister have been very clear. They state that abortion for reasons of gender alone is illegal.’ She added: ‘The Prime Minister has described the practice as simply appalling. But they are being ignored. ‘The British Pregnancy Advisory Service (BPAS), which performs around 60,000 abortions a year, flatly disagrees. ‘Even today they are still advising women in one of their leaflets and on their website that abortions for reasons of foetal sex is not illegal because the law is silent on the matter. ‘The British Medical Association (BMA) holds yet another interpretation. They argue there may be cases where having a child of a particular gender may be a legal and ethical justification for an abortion on the grounds that the sex of the child may severely affect the pregnant woman's mental health.’ Ms Bruce said the abuse threatened against women because of the gender of their unborn child should be addressed, with the Bill aiming to help them. ‘The main motivation is we know sex-selective abortions are happening in the UK and little is being done to stop this,’ she said. ‘We know because of the growing number of courageous women speaking out about their experiences.’ MPs overwhelmingly backed the motion. The Bill will now be taken forward for a second reading in January. It is, however, highly unlikely to become law in its current form without Government support and parliamentary time. A poll by ComRes for the lobbying group Christian Concern found that 84 per cent of people believe gender abortion should be ‘explicitly banned by law’.","MPs voted to ban abortions on the grounds of gender in Commons today .

"With a serene turquoise glow glimmering from beneath, and icy blue radiance from within, they appear otherworldly. But these spellbinding icebergs, stunningly captured by American photographer Michael Leggero, are very much of earth. The 43-year-old eco-environmental photographer spent two days and nights battling constant 40 to 80-foot waves in the Drake Passage, the body of water between the southern tip of South America and the South Shetland Islands of Antarctica, to get to the icebergs. Michael said: 'When I photograph icebergs I feel awestruck. The water shapes each piece of ice into its own piece of art. Scroll down for video . Spellbinding: Photographer Michael Leggero has captured these images of icebergs in Antarctica . Otherworldly: The eco-environmental photographer says that people often show disbelief that the icebergs really look in real life as they do in his stunning photographs . Remote: The majestic icebergs are located in the Drake Passage, between the southern tip of South America and the South Shetland Islands . 'My images show pure nature, as that is how I describe Antarctica, simply pure nature,' the photographer, of Carthage, New York, said. 'It is the only place on our planet that humans have not left a presence behind. 'Every iceberg is different, the majesty of the size, the smoothness of the lines and curves, it's just awe-inspiring. 'I've never seen a bad iceberg. They are all beautiful, and I show that beauty and elegance in my photography.' Dedicated: Leggero spent two days and nights battling constant 40 to 80-foot waves to get to the icebergs . Beautiful light: The 43-year-old photographer, from New York says that a thunderstorm can make the already spectacular light even more incredible . 'Pure nature': Michael says his love of Antarctica is in part because 'it is the only place on our planet that humans have not left a presence behind' Nature at its best: Leggero says he has never seen a 'bad iceberg' - they are all beautiful . Michael has travelled right to the high Arctic above the 80th parallel north, to below the Antarctic Peninsula, and often gets within touching distance of the icebergs he photographs. 'The most common questions I hear are people wondering if the icebergs really do look like they do in my photographs, and the answer is yes. 'The light in some areas of icebergs really is spectacular and if you get a thunderstorm in the background it becomes even more incredible. 'Travelling through the ice is a feeling of relaxation and peace that I haven't found a comparison to anywhere else. In our fast paced lives, the serenity of floating between icebergs makes the rest of the world almost non-existent.' Natural beauty: 'Every iceberg is different,' he says. 'The majesty of the size, the smoothness of the lines and curves' Up close and personal: The adventurer often gets close enough to touch the icebergs he is photographing . Far and wide: Leggero has travelled to places including Hawaii, Alaska and Iceland to photograph landscaped, bird and animals . Photographing icebergs was never a goal of Leggero's, he reveals. 'As I started travelling the world I always explored areas that are sometimes difficult to access. 'Antarctica was never really number one on my list of places to visit until I sat in a photo lecture about how to use a certain type of software and the presenter was showing icebergs. 'I booked a last minute trip to Antarctica; barely survived the crossing of the rough waves of the Drake Passage, and the rest is history.' Leggero has been a professional photographer and photographic instructor for over 20 years. He has travelled the world photographing landscapes, birds and animals with recent locations including Hawaii, Iceland and Alaska. Isolated: 'In our fast paced lives, the serenity of floating between icebergs makes the rest of the world almost non-existent,' says Michael . Storm at sea: Moody skies and dark waters often create the most mesmerising photographs . Life-changing: Michael had no plans to travel to Antarctica until attending a lecture that showed images of icebergs, after which he booked a last-minute ticket .

"Pronounced dom-in-eeka, and not to be confused with the Dominican Republic, Dominica is promoted as the 'nature island'. And with good reason. Its volcanic peaks reach above 4,700ft - and with its valleys and gorges, rainforest and the cloud forest above, the island is extraordinarily beautiful. Its lushness is on account of it being the wettest island in the Caribbean, with more than 275 inches of rain falling a year in the interior — though this figure is far smaller on the coast. Sailboats and serenity: Scenes from the Pirates of the Caribbean movies have been filmed on Dominica . It has 365 rivers, one for every day of the year; and even in the drier season its waterfalls are magnificent. We were entranced by this compact Amazon, and found it hard to believe that so much of what you see today has grown up or been rebuilt since 1979 when Hurricane David stripped the coastal hillsides, decapitated trees in the central highlands and devastated homes and businesses. We based ourselves first at Beau Rive, a delightfully civilised and comfortable small hotel overlooking the rugged Atlantic coast. Owner-manager, Mark Steele, who grew up on a farm near Cambridge and later travelled widely, fell in love with Dominica and opened for business more than ten years ago. Delightfully deserted: The beaches in the north-east of the island, around Calibishie, are simply splendid . He is now building a retirement home in an even more lovely location - now there's an idea. Dominica is one of the few islands that still has descendants of the indigenous Kalinago (Carib) people, and you can visit a modest re-creation of a Kalinago settlement. We followed that with an easy stroll along Horseback Ridge. No one should go to Dominica without doing at least one hike that also involves swimming in a river or pool. The Waitukubuli Trail stretches for 115 miles along its winding route from the top to the bottom of the island, passing through the Morne Trois Pitons National Park, a World Heritage Site. There are helpful classifications of the various hikes in tourist literature and the indispensable Bradt Guide, which grades them by length, elevation, terrain and river crossings. Signposted timings are sometimes given, though in our experience they proved optimistic. Easy come, easy go: Woodford Hill Beach, on the east coast of Dominica, sums up the island's quiet charm . My wife and I, who are freedom-pass-age holiday hikers, found the well-trodden hike to the dramatic Middleham Falls enchanting and manageable. On another, more arduous, one to Sari Sari Falls from the east coast, there was the added entertainment of an encounter with a group of furtive Rastafarians skipping through the forest with trays of marijuana plants to be replanted somewhere discreet. Of the more challenging, longer hikes, the best known is the one across the hot streams and bubbling mud of the Valley of Desolation to the steaming and simmering Boiling Lake. It is clearly quite something to experience. The rainforest is always dripping and when it rains it is no less enjoyable - though cooler and slippier. Sensible shoes that can wade through rivers are a must and, unless you are a confident hiker, take a guide. Both the guides organised by our hotels were great fun, extremely knowledgeable and supportive when we were having a bit of difficulty; one of them, the wonderfully deep-voiced Alfred Rolls, had recently been guide to a National Geographic team exploring the highest parts of the Park. Sunday best: The island gained its name because Christopher Columbus 'discovered' it on a Sunday (Domingo) For thrill-seekers, there is river tubing or more adventurous river canyoning or whale-watching (90 per cent chance of seeing a whale, according to Rolls). In the north-east, around Calibishie, are beaches to rival the most beautiful and unspoilt in the Caribbean, with added stardust - they were used for filming Pirates Of The Caribbean. On the calmer west coast, we greatly enjoyed our couple of hours in lively Roseau, the capital, and in its small museum were intrigued to discover that in the 1890s limes replaced sugar as the main export crop, with much supplied to Britain for the production of Rose's Lime Juice. Dominicans care greatly about their natural heritage and their country's politics. Debate can become as hot as Boiling Lake, with issues ranging from the selling of citizenship and the influence of the Chinese to the state of the roads. Their independence of spirit is matched by the independent-minded travellers Dominica attracts. Stormy skies, bright horizons: A dark afternoon only amplifies the prettiness of the west-coast capital Roseau . Most accommodation is modest, though 'resort' hotels such as Rosalie Bay and Jungle Bay offer more in the way of facilities, and for those with deep pockets, there is the exclusive Secret Bay. After Beau Rive we stayed in one of the island's longest-established hotels, the charming and simple Papillote Wilderness Retreat. Anne Jno Baptiste is an American who came to Dominica in the early 60s. She and Dominican husband Cuthbert have created an exotic garden which attracts visitors who come to see the nearby Trafalgar Falls. Mick Jagger stayed here when he visited Dominica a few years ago (room 12 if you want to sleep in the same large and comfortable bed). That not many people recognised him, nor paid him special attention when he was there, just goes to show what an unspoilt, unpretentious place Dominica is. Western Oriental (0207 6661234, www.westernoriental.com) has seven nights' B&B at Rosalie Bay hotel from £1,095pp, including return flights and private transfers.

"He has broken a staggering 19 powerlifting records over the past two decades. He has also presided over thousands of services, weddings and baptisms at a Canadian church. Meet the Reverend Dr Kevin Fast, who has been dubbed the world's strongest priest. The 51-year-old, a pastor at St Paul's Lutheran Church for 22 years, still holds nine unbroken world records for powerlifting, including the heaviest plane pulled by a man (188.83 tonnes). Scroll down for video . Divine power:  The Reverend Dr Kevin Fast, pictured holding an atlas stone, is the world's strongest priest . Record holder: The 51-year-old, who has been pastor at the church in Canada for 22 years, still holds nine unbroken world records for powerlifting.  His feats include pulling a fire engine over 100 feet (pictured) Strong: He is also the Guinness World Record holder for the heaviest truck pulled by an arm wrestling move, the most cabers tossed in three minutes and the heaviest plane pulled by a man (188.83 tonnes, pictured) Duty: Mr Fast, of Cobourg, juggles his pastoral duties with competing professionally in Highland-style games . He is also the Gunniess World Record holder for the heaviest truck pulled by an arm wrestling move (12.5 tonnes), the most cabers tossed in three minutes (14) and the highest number of people lifted with the shoulders (11). His other feats include pulling a fire engine over 100ft and hauling a 40-tonne house down a road. Mr Fast, who lives in Cobourg, Canada, juggles his pastoral duties with competing professionally in Highland-style games in North America. 'Most people in religious circles find it hard to believe that I do all these feats of strength. A pastor is usually small and weak,' he said. 'Greatest achievement': Mr Fast is pictured pulling a 188.83-tonne CC-177 Globemaster III - a feat that earned him a world record and raised a whopping $65,000 for charity. He described it as his 'greatest achievement' Determined: 'Most people in religious circles find it hard to believe that I do all these feats of strength. A pastor is usually small and weak,' said Mr Fast. Above, the pastor, pictured without a beard, pulls a 40-tonne house . Two lives: 'But my parishioners at the church are always supportive. We are a nice big family,' he continued . Charitable: Mr Fast (pictured), who has three children, has broken a staggering 19 powerlifting records over the past two decades. He donates all of his winnings and money raised through his stunts to local charities . 'But my parishioners here at the church are always supportive. We are a nice big family and they like to hear about my exploits.' Since first trying out a set of dumbbells at the age of 12, Mr Fast has been putting himself through a gruelling training regime. 2008 - Heaviest truck pulled over 100ft (63.2 tonnes) 2009 - Heaviest plane pulled (188.83 tonnes) 2010 - Heaviest House pulled (40 tonnes) 2011 - Heaviest vehicle pulled by two people (75 tonnes) 2011 - Lifted and held 500kg for longest time (61 seconds) 2013 - Heaviest truck pulled with arm wrestling (12.5 tonnes) 2013 - Most people lifted with the shoulders (11) 2013 - Most cabers tossed in three minutes (14) 2013 - Heaviest sled pulled by Santa (17.5 tonnes) Most days he can be found training with atlas balls, tractor tyres and cabers on a plot of land gifted to him by the local authorities after he kept ruining the grass with his heavy lifting gear. The strongman, who has three children with his wife Suzanne, donates all of his winnings and money raised through his stunts to local charities. 'I've set many records over the years - I've pulled planes, trucks, ships and trains. Just about everything you can pull,' he said. 'About the only thing I haven't pulled has been muscles. I've been competing at an extreme level for 21 years and don't want to stop now. 'I've been given the ability to do this and I believe it is a gift from God. The deal with gifts like this is you have to use them to help people otherwise it would be ungrateful. 'So with all my world record attempts I've always tried to raise money for charity.' Mr Fast's greatest achievement was pulling a 188.83-tonne CC-177 Globemaster III - a feat that earned him a world record and raised a whopping $65,000 for charity. Describing the challenge, Mr Fast said: 'I was pulling and pulling the plane for about 45 seconds before it even started to move. 'I was completely exhausted - I couldn't feel my muscles any more, but my mind just took over. I pulled with everything I was worth and eventually it started rolling. Painful: Mr Fast is seen during his world record attempt for the most people lifted with the shoulders (11) Doing what he loves: 'I've set many records over the years - I've pulled planes, trucks, ships and trains. Just about everything you can pull,' said Mr Fast. 'About the only thing I haven't pulled has been muscles' 'After I broke the record, I didn't stop because I had zoned everything out and didn't hear the Guinness adjudicator. 'It was only when my son Jacob, who was alongside me, actually slapped me that I asked why he was hitting me and he shouted you've done it you can stop.' Despite his success, Mr Fast's unusual hobby of pushing himself to his physical limits does not sit too well with his wife. 'My family is very supportive of the things I do, but it hasn't always been that way,' said the priest. Looking ahead: Mr Fast said he plans to continue breaking records, including the most cars pulled in one go . 'After I set my first record my wife asked me to stop as it worried her too much. She is always concerned when I am doing these feats of strength and usually can't watch when they are taking place. 'But I have travelled the world to break records and so at least we get a nice trip out of it now.' Mr Fast said he plans to continue breaking records, including one for the most cars pulled in one go. 'Everyone wants to know what's next. I'm healthy and fit and I'm not going to stop yet,' he said. 'Going to attempt the record for the most cars pulled by a person in a few weeks. But I'm waiting for the next big idea to come my way.'","Pastor Kevin Fast, 51, still holds nine unbroken powerlifting world records .

"Ronald Koeman will be calling on the kids this weekend after injury and suspension decimated Southampton's squad. The club's best-ever top-flight start has been brought to an abrupt halt in recent weeks, with Tuesday's Capital One Cup loss at Sheffield United continuing an embarrassing run of form. That was Southampton's fifth straight defeat in all competitions and a result which has had repercussions far beyond denting confidence. Ronald Koeman looks on after his side lost 1-0 to League One team Sheffield United in the Capital One Cup . Dusan Tadic (left) is one of ten players who could be missing for Southampton's game against Everton . Morgan Schneiderlin and Victor Wanyama will miss Everton's visit to St Mary's this weekend after being booked at Bramall Lane, while Florin Gardos is suspended after being sent off against the League One side. Those absentees compound a growing injury list, with Jay Rodriguez, Sam Gallagher and Jack Cork joined on the sidelines by Dusan Tadic and Jake Hesketh. As if that was not enough, Steven Davis and Graziano Pelle are doubts for a match in which Koeman will be relying on Southampton's much-vaunted youth system. 'Our approach is not different now because we lost the last five games,' the Southampton manager said. Defender Florin Gardos (centre) was sent off in Southampton's defeat in Sheffield on Tuesday . 'We know that if we have a lot of injuries, like we have, it is one of the philosophies of the club to bring in young players. 'Maybe we will play two or three young under-21 players this Saturday, maybe we will have three on the bench. This is one of the philosophies.' Harrison Reed and Lloyd Isgrove are among those academy graduates with a chance of making a first Premier League start this weekend. Jason McCarthy, Dominic Gape, Jake Flannigan, Sam McQueen and Ryan Seager are others vying for a place in the squad to face Everton, as Saints look to end their worst losing run of the 21st century. Italy striker Graziano Pelle (left) is another potential absentee for Koeman on Saturday against Everton . 'It's sometimes difficult,' Koeman said. 'The team was doing well after a good start to the season and after a few weeks disappointed about the results. 'Not the way we lost against Burnley or Man United but very disappointed about the way we lost against Sheffield, because that was the first time to be disappointed about the team to have the fight, the spirit, the aggressive play that we didn't show. 'Sheffield showed us how you have to deal and to beat a Premier League club when you are a League One team.

Tottenham's Harry Kane (left), Eriksen (centre) and Jan Vertonghen celebrate their 89th-minute winner . The impact on Tottenham’s league position has been enormous, with nine points coming directly from their late shows, not to mention Wednesday's Capital One Cup quarter-final against Newcastle United, which follows a two-goal salvo at the end of their third-round win over Nottingham Forest. Pochettino was quick to praise his side’s character after the Liberty Stadium win, but Eriksen is convinced the fast finishes are derived from a hard summer following the Argentine's arrival. ‘Pre-season was the toughest I’ve experienced,’ he said. ‘The gaffer worked the players really hard. ‘But I think it is paying off now. Of course we are tired after games, that is normal, but as you see with us in the last few weeks we are able to go 100 per cent again and again at the end of the games. Before we wouldn't have been fit enough to go the whole game. Eriksen (left) scored a late winner for Tottenham  as they took all three points away from the Liberty Stadium . ‘Obviously there will be periods when the other team have the ball and you have to play differently. But in the end we have the confidence and power to keep going for 90 minutes. ‘We always seem to get that feeling late in a game when we can really go for it. We seemed to get more confident late in the game.’ Eriksen added: ‘It doesn’t matter how or when you win but I think everybody would rather win a bit earlier - although it wouldn’t be as exciting. ‘But the win at Swansea proves we have a lot of belief in the squad. Once again we showed our character and got over the line.’ Eriksen fire home the winner for Spurs as they left the Liberty Stadium with all three points . Tottenham were again far from impressive in beating Swansea, with Eriksen concerned that they are not performing consistently in a campaign that has already seen them beaten six times in the league. ‘We are where we are,’ he said. ‘It’s so close in the league at the moment. You get a win and you are right up there where you want to be. And if you lose you are down where you don’t want to be. At the moment we are in between. ‘We certainly need to be more consistent but we are going the right way.’ Eriksen points to the sky as he runs off in celebration having netted an 89th-minute winner .

"Celtic winger Aleksandar Tonev has lost his appeal against a seven-match ban for using racist language. A Scottish Football Association appeal tribunal threw out the appeal after the on-loan Aston Villa winger was earlier banned over an incident involving Aberdeen full-back Shay Logan. The SFA has published the report of both panels who examined the case. Celtic's Aleksandar Tonev (right) was handed a seven-match ban for racially abusing Aberdeen's Shay Logan (left) in a match in September and he has now had his appeal rejected by the SFA . Celtic manager Ronny Deila had earlier indicated the club would challenge the decision further if it was upheld. The report of the original panel hearing stated that Logan had accused Tonev of saying: 'Don't touch me you black c***' when the Aberdeen defender put his arm across the Celtic player moments after fouling him. Tonev denied saying the offensive words and no-one else heard them but the panel heard that Logan quickly told his captain, Mark Reynolds, referee Bobby Madden, and manager Derek McInnes. The report described Logan as an 'impressive witness'. Toney and Celtic assistant manager John Collins (left) leave Hampden Park after the original hearing . It added: 'He gave his evidence in a careful and measured manner. He gave clear and unequivocal evidence that Mr Tonev had used the language complained of and that it had been targeted at him.' However, the panel stated they were unable to accept the Bulgarian as 'either credible or reliable' on the central issue of the case. The report continued: 'His evidence on his understanding of the language said to have been used, was particularly unsatisfactory. 'In chief examination his evidence was to the effect that he did not know what the word 'c***' meant. 'On cross examination he explained that he had heard the term in his time at Aston Villa but did not know what it meant. He then accepted that he was aware that it was a term of abuse. Tonev (centre) sits with Leigh Griffiths (left) and Lukasz Zaluska on the bench against Dinamo Zagreb . 'The impression was of a witness giving a less than a full account of his actual understanding; and seemed to the tribunal to be an inherently improbable account.' Celtic, who were earlier issued with a UEFA charge over alleged 'crowd disturbances' during their Europa League defeat by Dinamo Zagreb last week, said they were 'extremely disappointed' by the outcome and vowed to take up the case with the governing body. A club statement read: 'We do not consider that any player should be found guilty of such a grave offence on the basis of the evidence presented in this case. 'Celtic Football Club will be approaching the Scottish FA to seek to address this issue. The winger heads through Glasgow airport ahead of Celtic's trip to Zagreb . 'We would like to make it clear that at no stage was it ever suggested that Shay Logan had made any false allegations. However, Aleksandar Tonev's position consistently has been that he did not say the words that were alleged to have been said and that he is not a racist. 'Celtic Football Club has enjoyed an excellent relationship with Aberdeen Football Club and this, of course, will continue. 'As we have said many times before, racism has no place in football and as a club which has been open to all ever since its formation in 1888, Celtic abhors racism of any kind. 'Clearly, Aleksandar continues to have our full support.' Celtic will face another disciplinary hearing on February 19 when UEFA's control, ethics and disciplinary body meets to discuss the incident in Croatia, which saw a flare lit in the visiting end.

"Jose Mourinho has revealed that Sir Bobby Robson came close to bringing Thierry Henry to Barcelona early in his career. The Chelsea manager revealed on the day Henry announced his retirement that the France striker came within 'an inch' of moving to the Nou Camp from Monaco, but instead went to Juventus in 1999. 'When I was an assistant in Barcelona with Mr (Bobby) Robson in 1996 (we tried to sign him). He was in Monaco and he went to Juventus, we lost him by an inch,' Mourinho told talkSPORT. Thierry Henry, seen here for Monaco in 1998, came within an 'inch' of joining Barcelona, says Jose Mourinho . Mourinho revealed that Henry came very close to signing for Barca before joining Juventus in 1999 . The French star went on to have a hugely successful career at Arsenal and is the club's leading scorer ever . 'After that he was not on my radar because it was never a possibility to come to my teams. Could you imagine in that moment leaving Arsenal to come to Chelsea? I wouldn't imagine that. 'He's the kind of player that you need forever, especially in the Premier League where he was more than any other place. 'He was OK in Barcelona and the (France) national team, but the real Thierry Henry, the player that we are all going to miss for ever, is the one that made unbelievable seasons and incredible history in the Premier League.' The current Chelsea manager was assistant to Robson (left) during his time at Barcelona . Henry did go on to spend three successful years with Barcelona between 2007 and 2010 . Mourinho is not intending to delve into the transfer market next month, but feared he might have to when Kurt Zouma was injured in Tuesday night's Capital One Cup quarter-final win at Derby. 'When I saw Zouma I was scared,' said Mourinho, who revealed the France defender is now fine. 'We can't lose players for a long period of time. 'Happily for us and for the kid, no.

"Jack Colback says Newcastle will again have to prove their resilience to recover from setbacks as they gear up for a week which will define their season. The Magpies failed to show as they were beaten 4-1 at Arsenal at the weekend, just 24 hours after manager Alan Pardew collected the Manager of the Month prize for November. But with a League quarter-final at Spurs on Wednesday followed by Sunday’s Tyne-Wear derby, former Sunderland midfielder Colback says his new club can ill afford to dwell on the disappointment of the Emirates. Jack Colback (left) vies for possession with Danny Welbeck during his side's 4-1 loss at the Emirates . That result came just 24 hours after Alan Pardew collected the Manager of the Month prize for November . ‘It’s a massive week,’ said the 25-year-old, who takes on the Black Cats for the first time since his controversial move between the North-East rivals in the summer. ‘We have to forget about that performance. They out-played us and won all their battles, which was disappointing. We weren’t quite at it and were a bit off the pace. Maybe we didn’t show Arsenal enough respect. ‘But these are two massive games now. We’ve got to put things right. But we have shown character to bounce back all season, just look at the win we got against Chelsea (2-1).’ Wednesday’s game at White Hart Lane is Newcastle’s third away tie at top-flight opposition in the competition. Olivier Giroud (left) bagged a double against the Magpies including a superb effort in the 58th minute . Santi Cazorla also bagged a brace against Pardew's side and capped off the rout with an audacious penalty . Crystal Palace and Manchester City have already been beaten and, with a place at Wembley just two rounds away, debate has been raging on Tyneside as to which is the more important game during this coming week. Pardew has insisted that he will be going all out for victory in both, but admits his team need to improve upon their performance at the weekend to stand any chance of winning either. ‘We didn’t show our true quality at Arsenal – we’re better than that,’ he said. Colback (centre) grapples with Chelsea midfielder Willian (left) during their clash in December . ‘But the character of this team is never lost. We need to stay at the levels we have set, like we did against Chelsea. ‘It’s a big week. It’s the third Premier League away tie we’ve had now, so we’ ve done it the hard way but hopefully we can do it again.’ Newcastle, meanwhile, are set to allow Hatem Ben Arfa to head out on loan for the remainder of his contract with Hull almost certain to terminate his season-long stay as early as next month. The 27-year-old has failed to impress at the KC Stadium and manager Steve Bruce has lost patience with the former France international.","Newcastle were thrashed 4-1 by Arsenal on Saturday .

"World No1 Michael Van Gerwen won his second World Grand Prix title with a 5-3 win over James Wade in Dublin on Sunday. Van Gerwen found himself a set down twice but from 3-3 raised his game to storm the final two sets to claim the £100,000 title. The World Champion won the title for the second time in three years and was relieved to reclaim the World Grand Prix crown. World No1 Michael Van Gerwen poses with the World Grand Prix title after beating James Wade 5-3 . 'This is amazing and to win this tournament again is fantastic, said van Gerwen. 'I missed a lot of doubles but I did everything I could to win the game. 'The 110 checkout to win the fifth set showed how good I was, but it also showed James' class with the way he came back after that. 'James could have won the game, but I think I was the stronger player when I needed to be. James made it very difficult but I was just the better player and I'm so happy. 'He did brilliantly to reach the final and deserved to be there, but there can only be one winner and I'm glad it's me. 'You play darts to be the best in the world and I'm very glad that I'm in the number one position. I want to stay there but firstly I'm going to enjoy this because it's a huge win for me.' Van Gerwen holds the World Grand Prix title aloft having rallied from a set down twice to take the title . Wade, a two-time World Grand Prix winner, was the better player at the start as Van Gerwen squandered chances on doubles. Van Gerwen leveled from a leg down with some mighty darts, taking just 12, 14 and 13 to win his legs. The Dutchman was forced to retaliate again as Wade raced through set three but Van Gerwen held on to level 2-2. Van Gerwen edged a dramatic fifth set which was sent into a decider. Wade threw 180 and 177 to leave 20 in leg five only to miss three darts at double 10. The Dutchman celebrates after throwing some fine darts on the way to his second World Grand Prix title . Two time World Grand Prix champion James Wade holds his runners up trophy after Van Gerwen's comeback . The world number one seized upon his chance with a magnificent 110 checkout to put him 3-2 up in the final. Wade hit back immediately with 141, 61 and 96 checkouts as he came from a leg down to win the sixth set 3-1 and square the match. The seventh set was the pivotal set in the final outcome as Wade, the 2007 and 2010 winner, missed three set darts at 2-0 up. Again Van Gerwen roared back with some sensational arrows. The Dutchman took out 106 for a 12-darter on his way to lead 4-3. He then rattled through set eight, landing his ninth 180 of the match at 2-0 up to pull clear in leg three, before landing tops to secure the prestigious title.","The World number one produced some fine darts to take the title 5-3 .

Taylor (2nd right) poses with  Peter Wright (left) and Michael Van Gerwen (2nd left) ahead of the tournament . His mother’s condition is so bad that she has often struggled to recognise her son, or other members of the family, when they have visited her at the Staffordshire hospital where she has spent the past month. ‘She is losing her memory now,’ said 54-year-old Taylor. ‘One minute she will know you, the next thing she won’t know who you are. She will think you are Tommy Steele. Or Edward VIII one minute. It’s awful, like. It’s life unfortunately. It’s heart-breaking. ‘It’s worse for the kids because my mum is like their mum, if you know what I mean. She is the guru. ‘She is still there. It’s a good job I haven’t got an insurance policy on her, I tell her. “Come on you hurry up”. I said that to her the other day. I said: “I have got a £2million policy on you. Hurry up will you”.

Two of his works of art are pictured above . To get his professional-looking images, Mr Coles takes three separate images using his array of telescopes, sometimes on different nights. He uses filters to select different wavelengths and then layers up his images to make the perfect picture (shown above) ‘My filters select for each of these wavelengths. So I take three separate images, usually on three separate nights to get the perfect images.’ The telescopes are connected to a computer, which applies a colour to each filter. Mr Coles then combines the images so that one multi-coloured picture including all three gases is made.The images are called Hubble palette pictures. Mr Coles spends all night out on his deck taking pictures with an exposure as long as 15 minutes. It has to be very long to allow as much light in as possible, so the telescope has enough light to capture the shapes clearly. One picture can be the culmination of three nights or up to 20 hours work. A supernova is the explosion of a star and the largest explosion that takes place in space.

"Starbucks has announced that it's introducing a new holiday drink - the Chestnut Praline Latte - giving the Pumpkin Spice Latte a run for its money. The frothy concoction, which will debut nationwide on November 12, combines espresso with steamed milk, caramelized chestnut flavor and spices. It's then topped off with whipped cream and spiced praline crumbs. Generating buzz: The Chestnut Praline Latte, which combines espresso with steamed milk, caramelized chestnut flavor and spices, will launch at Starbucks on November 12 . The coffee giant notes that it's the 'first new holiday handcrafted beverage in five years,' joining cold-weather offerings such as the Peppermint Mocha, Gingerbread Latte and Caramel Brulee Latte. While the drink's launch is still a few weeks away, some customers already tried it last year when it was released in select cities, sharing their reactions on social media. 'Drank a Starbucks Chestnut Praline Latte & now all I can think about are fireplaces & pine trees & ugly sweaters & beautiful Christmas break,' tweeted Lauren Hallowell in November. 'Holy moly, the #Starbucks chestnut praline latte may be my new favorite holiday beverage!,' Alison Bourg wrote on Instagram a month later. A recent press release explained that the brand is trying to 'transform and elevate' the Starbucks experience this holiday season. 'Holiday 2013 witnessed a seismic shift in consumer behavior in which many traditional brick-and-mortar retailers experienced a decline in foot traffic compared to significant growth in online shopping,' CEO Howard Schultz said in a statement. 'Tis the season: The new drink joins Starbucks' other holiday drinks, which include the Caramel Brulee Latte (left), Peppermint Mocha (center) and Gingerbread Latte (right) 'Since that time, we have been focused on radically redefining the Starbucks retail experience for our partners, customers and stores,' he added. Last year, Starbucks announced that it had sold more than 200 million Pumpkin Spice Lattes - its most buzzed-about seasonal drink. The drink, introduced in 2003, is a combination of espresso, pumpkin-flavored syrup and steamed milk. It's topped with sweetened whipped cream and spices such as cinnamon,nutmeg and clove. The Pumpkin Spice Latte has inspired cult-like devotion: Two years ago, a temporary shortage of pumpkin spice syrup in some locations caused an outcry on social media. And last fall, one customer started a petition on Change.org asking the brand to create a vegan version of the drink.","The Chestnut Praline Latte combines espresso with steamed milk, caramelized chestnut flavor and spices, and is topped with whipped cream and spiced praline crumbs ."
"Raheem Sterling was partying at a London nightclub until 3am just a day after he complained about being 'too tired' to play for England, it was revealed today. The Liverpool winger did not start the Euro 2016 qualifier in Estonia because of fatigue but 24 hours later went to Cirque le Soir with national team mates Danny Welbeck and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain. One partygoer said she saw him 'up on his chair dancing' at the West End club with dwarves, snakes, bearded ladies and fire eaters to entertain customers.

After flying back to Manchester straight after the game on October 12 the following day he travelled 200-plus miles to London to meet with Arsenal duo Welbeck and Oxlade-Chamberlain and Swansea City midfielder Jonjo Shelvey. A woman at the club told The Sun Sterling was the centre of attention at the club, with the DJ repeatedly shouting his name. She said a friend joked: 'My dad's a Liverpool fan and he'll be furious to see this. People were aware of the England match and the tiredness comments.' Another clubber said: 'I saw Raheem there. I don't know what time he was out till but I'm pretty sure he had a good time.' Roy Hodgson and Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers were forced to hold takes after Raheem Sterling complained of fatigue ahead of England’s win in Estonia. The 19-year-old jad first admitted leg weariness to coach Gary Neville last Saturday during England’s final training session ahead of the Euro 2016 qualifier. Sterling told Hodgson on Saturday he was struggling with tiredness and form and was replaced in the starting line-up by Adam Lallana for England's 1-0 victory in the Euro 2016 qualifier.

But the 19-year-old came off the bench to win the free-kick from which Wayne Rooney scored the winning goal. Hodgson said: 'People don't like it when you tell the truth. We were doing a light session. Just before we started, Raheem came to me and said ""look I really am feeling a bit tired"". Last week, Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers defended his young star, insisting Sterling had not refused to play for his country. He said: 'This is a boy that felt a bit tired but he didn't say he didn't want to play. He's a human being, not a machine.' However, the revelations will heap more controversy on the 19-year-old as he prepares to face European champions Real Madrid in the Champions League at Anfield tonight.

"Glenn Hoddle feels Tottenham lack a special player and that they will struggle to make the top four unless the north London club can get one of their strikers firing. Tottenham currently sit 10th in the Barclays Premier League after an inconsistent start to the season which has seen Mauricio Pochettino's side win as many games as they have lost in their first 15 matches. Hoddle, who made 377 appearances for Spurs during a 12-year stay at White Hart Lane before managing the club between 2001 and 2003, feels a few new players could lead to a decent run of form which could see them break into the top four. Glenn Hoddle (right), who played for and managed Tottenham, believes the club lack world class players . 'He may want to bring in some fresh people. Whether Daniel (Levy) is going to be up for that remains to be seen,' said Hoddle. 'It is very difficult nowadays. There is a lack of world class strikers and midfield players which control the game, express themselves and that is what I think they miss. They have some good players but they don't have a special player.' And Hoddle also feels Pochettino has not been able with his current squad to play the type of pressing football which brought him so much success at Southampton. 'There's a lot of talent there and the manager will try and get best out of the talent there,' Hoddle said. Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino has so far failed to get the best out of his squad . Defender Vertonghen reacts while sitting on the White Hart Lane pitch against Crystal Palace . 'He's tinkered with it (their style of play), I saw them at home to Everton they were very positive, at Southampton he wanted a tempo and he got it. 'The personnel at Tottenham are different - they won't press as hard. It is something they have worked on at Spurs and something they will try and improve on. 'They have got to put a really good run together (to break into the top four). If you win two or three games in this league and it can turn around. The strikers have to start scoring goals, I think then the team can feed off that.' Roberto Soldado is one of the forwards Tottenham need to start firing, with the former Valencia striker, who cost Spurs £26million at the start of last season, netting just once in the league this season. 'It hasn't happened (for Soldado) yet,' Hoddle, who is coaching at QPR and working with Zapsportz.com, said. 'He could move somewhere else and embarrass Tottenham and do well. 'He needs confidence. A few more goals and you will see the best of him.'

"Jose Mourinho has once again insisted that Chelsea goalkeeper Petr Cech is still a crucial part of his squad.

'When Courtois was injured against Arsenal and Petr Cech comes to play on minute 20, I was so calm. I wasn't worried about a change of goalkeeper. 'So when you have on the bench a super goalkeeper like Petr Cech this is the most important thing. 'I have to feed that ambition to keep him...

"Lloyds Bank has put up instructions telling foreign staff how to use the loo, with details such as 'sit on the toilet - do not stand on it', and 'please flush it with your hand and not your foot'. With the help of diagrams, workers are shown how to open the door using their hand, and are requested not to leave toilet roll on the door handle. The instructions, put up in Lloyds Bank's Old Broad Street office in central London, give full instructions of British etiquette in the lavatory, including 'The sinks are for washing your hands only - no using hand towels or toilet paper as a plug'. Please do not stand on the toilet: Lloyds Bank has put up instructions on British loo etiquette for foreign workers . Other tips including toilet-users to throw used loo roll down the loo, rather than put it in a bin, but telling them to do the opposite with plastic cups. The instructions are there for workers from around the world with different toilet habits.  For example in south America, it is common to put used toilet roll into a bin beside the loo because few houses have sophisticated drains that can cope with loo roll. And in continental Europe, squatting over a 'hole-in-the-ground' toilet has been the norm until very recently. The poster has gone up in several Lloyds Bank offices, and a spokesman said today: 'We take the health and safety of our colleagues very seriously.' The high street bank is just the latest business to acknowledge the different toilet habits of workers from overseas - factories across the country are reportedly putting up posters detailing British loo etiquette as more workers arrive from overseas. Last week MailOnline reported how a DHL warehouse in Swindon had installed a European-style 'hole in the ground' loo because foreign workers kept breaking the English-style loo seat by standing on it. When managers at the depot, a . distribution centre for B&Q, realised that their employees from . Eastern Europe preferred squatting while going to the loo, they ordered a . toilet to match their requirements. Continental style: A squat toilet has been installed in a DHL distribution warehouse in Swindon (file photo) A source said the new loo was installed after instructions telling staff how to use an English loo went ignored, saying: 'Staff were fed up with the toilet seats breaking and workers leaving a mess.' British visitors to Europe often complain about the lack of sit-down toilets, particularly in motorway service stations and bus and railway stations. But British-style loos are comparatively rare in some countries including India and Japan, where they were only introduced recently. However, squat loos may be set to gain in popularity in Britain, thanks to doctors who claim that the squatting posture brings health benefits. Some medics believe that squatting while going to the toilet is a more 'natural' position, and could protect against disease.","Diagram has gone up in bank's Old Broad Street branch in central London .

"Crystal Palace manager Neil Warnock remembers the first time he clapped eyes on Yannick Bolasie. 'I remember he played up front for us when I was at QPR in a practice match and I remember saying to Flavio (Briatore, who owned QPR), ""I can get this lad on £2,000 a week and he's worth a shot, he won't cost anything"". 'And he said: ""No you can't sign anyone, I'm selling the club"". I'll never forget it. VIDEO Scroll down for Sportsmail's Big Match Stats: Tottenham 0-0 Crystal Palace . Yannick Bolasie takes a tumble as he battles for the ball with Spurs defender Ben Davies during the match . Crystal Palace were unlucky not to take three points from a game that, at times, left Neil Warnock bewildered . 'So I said to Bolasie: ""If I were you I'd go south and get games under your belt"".

Spurs have 10 points from a possible 24 at White Hart Lane this season . And where would Palace be without their mesmeric attacking midfielder? He was at his bewildering best on Saturday as Palace left Tottenham unlucky not to have recorded a shock win. One piece of skill in the left-hand corner, that left Eric Dier and Ryan Mason for dead, was particularly outrageous. 'It's obvious I've been working with him in training,' joked Warnock. 'Some days he does a trick and you laugh at him, it's laughable. It's spontaneous. You never see him practise it.'

Spurs manager Mauricio Pochettino even pinpointed the 25-year-old as Palace's most potent attacking threat ahead of Saturday's clash. Not that it helped nullifying the Congo international's impact. Pochettino provided another explanation as to why his side struggled against Warnock's men. 'When you compete in the same condition as the opponent then it's not a problem,' he said. 'We played Chelsea on Wednesday, but Palace played Aston Villa on Tuesday and had one day more (to recover). I don't complain about it but when you have one less day to prepare then it's difficult.

"Aleksandar Tonev  broke cover on Wednesday to again deny he is a racist — despite his appeal against a seven-game ban for abusing Aberdeen’s Shay Logan failing on Tuesday. The on-loan Aston Villa winger lost his bid to have an earlier Judicial Panel judgment overturned, with an appellate body branding him an unreliable witness. Although Celtic have the option of taking the matter to the Court of Arbitration for Sport, so far the Parkhead club have only said they will seek to address the evidence used in the case — namely one man’s word against another — with the SFA. Aleksandar Tonev (left) was deemed an unreliable witness by the SFA Judicial Panel . Tonev and Celtic assistant manager John Collins (left) leave Hampden Park after the original hearing . Tonev is alleged to have called Aberdeen defender Shay Logan (pictured) a 'black c***' But on Wednesday the Bulgarian international appeared to draw a line under the matter by releasing a statement via the club website that suggested he feels the matter should now rest. ‘A lot has happened in the last few months,’ Tonev said. ‘It has been a very difficult time for me and everyone involved. All I can do is move on from this now. ‘I have made my case all along that I never used the words I was accused of using. ‘I say again that I did not do this, I know what I am and I am not a racist. ‘I want everyone to understand that — most of all the Celtic fans, who have been a great support to me since coming to the club.

The Bulgarian was hit with a charge of racially abusing his opponent after Logan complained to referee Bobby Madden, his boss Derek McInnes and Celtic No 2 John Collins. The Appellate Tribunal, chaired by senior judge Lord Bonomy, found the Bulgarian guilty of calling Logan a ‘black c***’ and ruled there was no reason to overturn the initial verdict.","Aleksandar Tonev was given seven-game ban for racial abuse .

"One of the Brooklyn Tech HS students victimized by a predatory math teacher had lingering affections for him even after he assaulted her, says her heartsick mother. Sean Shaynak is accused of having sex with six students and allegedly sent a picture of his genitals to another 16-year-old girl in his class. The mother, who remains anonymous as does her daughter, says Shaynak knew the naive girl had fallen for him, a trust he was happy to exploit. Busted: Teacher Sean Shaynak, 44, allegedly took advantage of naive young girls as he victimized students before he was finally busted when he sent a photo of his genitals to a 16-year-old student and she showed the photograph to her parents who reported him to the police . In an interview with The New York Post the mother says he would give her daughter perfect grades even if she turned in unfinished work. 'I raised my children to trust people - but it looks like you can't,' she said. Her daughter, who graduated from high school last year, is now 19, and studying criminal justice in college. She says her first suspicions about Shaynak's appetites came last year when she found him with several bikini-clad female students, her daughter included. He even had his own revealing swimwear. 'The thing that surprised me was the way he laid on the beach,' she said. 'You could see...everything.' The group was gossiping about sex, with Shaynak holding court about his taste for Russian girls, which her daughter happened to be. 'He was talking about how beautiful Russian girls are and how sexy they are,' the mother said. 'It was scary. 'It was noticeable the way he looked at them and got excited, like he wants somebody, you could tell..' she said. 'When you see a girl and get horny - that's what he was like.' Her daughter later expressed that she had a crush on Shaynak. 'She said, 'Isn't he cute?' I said, 'Yes, he's cute as a man,'' the woman said. 'She said, 'I kind of like him.'' He had allegedly sodomized the girl months earlier in May. 'The judgement for him should be high,' the woman said. 'Because it's children...and it could affect them for the rest of their life. I don't believe he will change. 'He should definitely go to prison for the rest of his life.' On the day after school ended in June, instructor Sean Shaynak allegedly sent the girl a picture of his privates to her cell phone via Snapchat, the girl's angered father told The New York Daily News on Thursday. Shaynak remained in custody on Wednesday, a day after he pleaded not guilty to the new charges. Bail was set at $750,000 bond and was at $250,000 for the previous charge. Defense attorney Kimberly Summers declined to comment. The charges in the new indictment include kidnapping, forcible touching, sexual abuse and criminal sexual act. Shaynak faces up to 25 years in prison on the top charge, authorities said. Shaynak, 44, pleaded not guilty in August to charges including dissemination of indecent material to a minor. Authorities say he sent a photo of his genitals to a 16-year-old female student. Authorities said on Tuesday that computers and phones taken after his arrest found text messages, photos and videos detailing sexual interactions with six teens, from ages 13 to 19, between 2011 and 2014. Those interactions included taking a 15-year-old girl to a nude beach and giving alcohol and cigarettes to minors, officials said. 'These alleged actions are completely unacceptable and have no place in, or outside of, our schools,' City Department of Education spokeswoman Devora Kaye said. 'The DOE took swift action to immediately reassign Mr. Shaynak following his initial arrest. He is not, and will not be, in contact with students. Student safety remains our top priority.' Brooklyn Tech is one of the most selective high schools in the city. The teacher had allegedly been trying to lure the most recent 16-year-old student who came forward with the text message into an inappropriate relationship for two years. He was considered a 'cool teacher’ because he offered to buy her cigarettes. 'Sick': Sean Shaynak, 44, allegedly had sex with multiple students at the school where he taught, sent them explicit messages and took them to nude beaches and sex clubs. He has pleaded not guilty . The girl's father said that he also offered to take his daughter to the park and once asked her to pose for him in a project. 'He asked her to pose for him for some kind of a project, and she declined,' the furious father told The New York Daily News on Thursday. 'He wanted to take her to the park. ... We later learned he would buy her cigarettes.' Finally when Shaynak allegedly sent the girl a picture of his crotch, she reported the incident to her parents. The girl's father had a friend in the FBI and they immediately reached out to police. 'It was immediate outrage on my part, ‘said her father. 'You can imagine we’re all very shaken up and extremely concerned.' The girl took the stand against the teacher two months ago and spoke before a Brooklyn grand jury. He said that while his daughter is strong she is hurt by the incident and it has rattled her trust. 'She likes to play that she’s strong and tough ... but then she’s my little (girl) all over again asking for my help,' the dad said. 'The main concern is that this guy is off the street and that he stays behind bars and and doesn’t have any access to kids.' Sean Shaynak is a divorced dad-of-one who taught math and physics at Brooklyn Technical High School, which is attended by Mayor Bill de Blasio's son Dante. During the investigation into that claim, authorities searched his home, computers and phones and allegedly unearthed thousands of inappropriate text messages, photographs and videos. They allegedly learned that he had had relations with six students, who ranged in age from 13 to 19, between 2011 and 2014, NBC New York reported. 'The defendant, clearly from his actions, looked to groom these students,' assistant district attorney Joseph Mancino said in Brooklyn Supreme Court, the New York Daily News reported. He took one 15-year-old girl to a nude beach in New Jersey without her parents' permission and he also took her to his home, where he plied her with alcohol until she passed out, Mancino said. Shaynak also asked the girl to take part in lesbian sex with another student, prosecutors claim. During a relationship with another girl, he allegedly watched her have sex with other people at a sex club. He also had sex with another girl but she put up resistance when the sex went too far - but he forced himself on her anyway, prosecutors said, the Daily News reported. Exclusive: He taught for five years at Brooklyn Technical High School, where Bill de Blasio's son attends school. Shaynak allegedly had relationships with girls ranging in age from 13 to 19, between 2011 and 2014 . Shaynak also allegedly sent photos of his genitals to four students, including two minors, and gave the teenagers alcohol and cigarettes. He also gave the girls top grades even though they did no work, the prosecutor said. On Tuesday, Shaynak's lawyer Kimberly Summers pleaded not guilty on his behalf. His bail was set at $1 million. He pleaded not guilty last month to charges including dissemination of indecent material to a minor and harassment. He was arrested on Tuesday morning on these latest claims. Brooklyn Tech, where Shaynak worked for five years, is based in Fort Greene and is one of the city's most selective public schools. Dante de Blasio attends the school, but students said he was not taught by Shaynak. Shaynak has a nine-year-old daughter. He and his wife are divorced and she lives upstate.","Mother says she witnessed teacher Sean Shaynak gossiping with group of teens about sex in revealing swimwear .

"Thomas Eric Duncan's temperature spiked to 103F during the hours of his initial visit to an emergency room - a fever that was flagged with an exclamation point in the hospital's record-keeping system, according to his newly-released medical records today. Despite telling a nurse that he had recently been in Africa and displaying other symptoms that could indicate Ebola, the man who would become the only person to die from the disease in the U.S. underwent a battery of tests and was eventually sent home. Duncan's family provided his medical records today, more than 1,400 pages in all. They encompass his time in the ER, his urgent return to the hospital two days later and chronicle his steep decline as his organs began to fail. Scroll down for video . Thomas Eric Duncan, 42, is the first person to die from the recent Ebola outbreak on U.S. soil. He passed away on Wednesday morning at a Dallas hospital . Josephus Weeks, nephew of ebola patient Thomas Eric Duncan who died earlier this week in Dallas, looks through hundreds of pages of medical documents in a hotel room today . Duncan carried the deadly virus with him from his home in Liberia, though he showed no symptoms when he left for the United States. He arrived in Dallas on September 20 and fell ill several days later. When he first showed up at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital, the man complained of abdominal pain, dizziness, a headache and decreased urination. He reported severe pain - rating it an eight on a scale of 10. Doctors gave him CT scans to rule out appendicitis, stroke and numerous other serious ailments. Ultimately, he was prescribed antibiotics and told to take Tylenol, then returned to the apartment where he was staying with his partner, Louise Troh, her son and two adult nephews. In spite of his fever, a physician's note dated September 26, said Duncan was 'negative for fever and chills'. 'I have given patient instructions regarding their diagnosis, expectations for the next couple of days, and specific return precautions,' according to the emergency room physician's note. 'The condition of the patient at this time is stable.' After his condition worsened, someone in the apartment called 911, and paramedics took him back to the hospital on September 28. That's when he was admitted and swiftly put in isolation. Josephus Weeks, Duncan's nephew, said the care his uncle received was 'either incompetence or negligence'. Either way 'there is a problem, and we need to find the answer to it,' he said, adding that it was 'conspicuous' that all the white Ebola patients in the U.S. survived 'and the one black man died'. The medical records, released today, contain some 1400 pages in all of the Ebola patient's care from his first visit to hospital to his more critical care . Josephus Weeks sits behind a stack of medical documents in a hotel room on Friday. The records revealed that Duncan's temperature spiked to 103 degrees during the hours of his initial visit to an emergency room . The documents also show that a nurse recorded early in Duncan's first hospital visit that he recently came to the U.S. from Africa, though he denied having been in contact with anyone sick. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had alerted hospitals nationwide to take a travel history for patients with Ebola-like symptoms. According to the records, Duncan was 45. Relatives said he was 42. The discrepancy could not be immediately resolved. In a statement issued Friday, Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital said it had made procedural changes and continues to 'review and evaluate' the decisions surrounding Duncan's care. Doctors who evaluated Duncan did not respond to messages left at their offices. Dr. Amesh Adalja, an infectious-disease specialist at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center who reviewed some of the records, said Duncan's travel history was listed in a nursing notice but not in the physician's note. The patient's 103-degree fever might warrant 'a little more investigation,' Adalja said. A chart showed he did not arrive with a fever but left with one. By Duncan's second ER visit, the care was 'impeccable,' the doctor said. Dallas physicians immediately signaled concern about Ebola and 'spared no measure to try to keep him alive'. The hospital has repeatedly changed its account of what the medical team knew when it released Duncan from the emergency room early on September 26. A few days later, on September 30, it initially said Duncan did not tell the staff he had been in Africa. On October 1, it said Duncan's nurse had been aware of the Africa connection but did not share that information with the rest of the medical team. The next day, the hospital blamed a flaw in its electronic health-records systems for not making Duncan's travel history directly accessible to his doctor. A day later, on October 3, the hospital issued a statement saying Duncan's travel history had been available to all hospital workers, including doctors, who treated him during his initial visit. Dr Kent Brantly pictured making a speech at Abilene Christian University in Texas today. The first American flown back to the U.S. for treatment of Ebola, said he spoke with a doctor caring for Duncan and was willing to donate blood - but their blood types were incompatabile . On Thursday, Texas Health strenuously defended Mr Duncan's treatment and said he was given the highest level of care 'regardless of nationality or ability to pay'. The Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital in Dallas was responding to claims from the 42-year-old Liberian's family that he was given substandard treatment because he was 'a poor black man'. The hospital said Mr Duncan had been cared for by a team of over 50 doctors and nurses, 24 hours a day. The hospital said Mr Duncan was not given the experimental drug ZMapp because the manufacturer has no more stocks and that he was not given a blood transfusion from an Ebola survivor because he was a different blood group. Dr Kent Brantly, the first American flown back to the U.S. for treatment of Ebola, confirmed that account, saying he spoke with a doctor caring for Duncan and was willing to donate blood. But their blood types were incompatible, he said on Friday in an interview with Abilene Christian University's alumni magazine where he was giving a speech on surviving the Ebola virus.

Hospital spokesman for Texas Presbyterian did not immediately respond to messages on Friday following the decision by Mr Duncan's family to release his medical records . Details of his care were released as Duncan's nephew launched a renewed attack on the Dallas hospital, claiming his uncle had received inferior treatment. Josephus Weeks told MSNBC: 'He is a poor black man. He had a very deep accent coming from West Africa. 'I believe they [the hospital authorities] didn't believe he deserved the care that everyone else should get. And you don't treat people like that.' The hospital also claimed Mr Duncan was appropriately dealt with when he first presented to the hospital feeling unwell with Ebola-like symptoms - and was sent home with antibiotics - two days before he was rushed to hospital and given the correct diagnosis. It said: 'In addition, we'd like to correct some misconceptions that have been reported about Mr. Duncan's first visit. Our care team provided Mr. Duncan with the same high level of attention and care that would be given any patient, regardless of nationality or ability to pay for care. 'In this case that included a four-hour evaluation and numerous tests. We have a long history of treating a multicultural community in this area.' Five US citizens have been diagnosed with Ebola and three have recovered. Virus victims Kent Brantley and Nancy Writebol were treated with the experimental drug ZMapp. Dr Rick Sacra and NBC camera Ashoka Mukpo received transfusions of Dr Brantley's blood.
