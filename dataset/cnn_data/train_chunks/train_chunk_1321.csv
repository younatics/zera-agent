"Liberal MP Warren Entsch has become the first to break ranks with his party to publicly accuse Tony Abbott of undermining cabinet ministers after a week of internal tension. Mr Entsch hit back at the Prime Minister's claims of sexism within the Liberal party, after Mr Abbott labelled recent criticisms of his chief-of-staff Peta Credlin as motivated by gender. Along with longstanding Federal MP and former Attorney-General Philip Ruddock, Mr Entsch lodged a formal complaint against Mr Abbott, defending concerns about Ms Credlin's level of power. 'It's not about her bloody gender for God's sake. Let me tell you, it doesn't matter if her name is    H-A-R-R-Y or  D-I-C-K,' Mr Entsch said. Scroll down for video . Queensland Liberal MP Warren Entsch has hit out against the statement, lodging a formal complaint against the Prime Minister and accusing Mr Abbott of undermining cabinet ministers . 'To suggest there's an issue because of gender I find offensive. He (Mr Abbott) has basically said, ""If they don't like it they are sexists"". If he thinks our legitimate concern...is trivialised to suggest we are sexist is mind-boggling,' he told The Sunday Telegraph. 'He needs to be very careful because there's a lot of cabinet ministers who have a problem with how the Prime Minister's office is operating. It's as bad as it's ever been,' Mr Entsch said. The MP's comments follow Mr Abbott's slap down of members of his own party on Friday amid growing reports of tension between Peta Credlin - his top adviser - and coalition ministers. 'Do you really think that my chief of staff would be under this kind of criticism if her name was P-E-T-E-R as opposed to P-E-T-A?' Mr Abbott asked. Mr Abbott said on Friday that if people had a problem with his office they should bring the complaints to him, and was backed by supporters who said that unhappy ministers should confront Ms Credlin, rather than air grievances through the media. 'If they've got any balls, they would go and talk to her herself,' said junior minister Jamie Briggs, calling his colleagues 'gutless', The Age reported. Statement: Prime Minister Tony Abbott has the attacks on his chief adviser Peta Credlin are motivated by sexism . 'They're like two Siamese fighting fish in the same tank': Earlier this week, that is what a Liberal frontbencher reportedly said about Ms Credlin, left, and Foreign Minister Julie Bishop . Mr Entsch appears to have taken this advice to heart, lodging a formal complaint against the Prime Minister and hitting out at structural issues within the government. Ms Credlin's husband currently holds the position of Liberal Federal director, making it difficult to discuss internal problems with either figure, who have held their respective roles for the past two elections. Earlier in the week reports emerged that Foreign Minister Julie Bishop had decided not to take any orders from Ms Credlin. 'They're like two Siamese fighting fish in the same tank,' a senior Coalition source told The Australian newspaper on Tuesday. Ms Bishop told The Sunday Telegraph that she had a positive relationship with Ms Credlin, declining to comment on Mr Abbott's 'sexism' claims. Ms Bishop said that she never sought to define issues through the 'prism of gender'. On Sunday morning, Mr Abbott continued with his Prime Ministerial duties, visiting Queenscliff Surf Life Saving Club on Sydney's north shore . The Prime Minister spoke to Surf Life Saving Australia's president Graham Ford (right) at the launch of the National Coastal Safety Report . 'Peta Credlin and I have fought battles together and will continue to do so. I have a positive and professional relationship with her,' said Ms Bishop. Mr Entsch also criticised the public display of Ms Credlin, who frequently appears in photographs with Mr Abbott, labelling it unusual behaviour. Mr Abbott's claims of sexism has already set the Twittersphere tittering as the prime minister has long been targeted by critics over his apparent 'women problem.' Some commentators have alleged that Mr Abbott's comments were made to distract from the decline in popularity of his leadership. Colleagues:  Julie Bishop took issue with Tony Abbott's decision to 'chaperone' her at the United Nations conference and now there are claims she is at odds with his chief of staff, Peta Credlin . Target: Prime Minister Julia Gillard, pictured here, rounded on Mr Abbott in her famous 'misogny' speech . Mr Abbott continued his official duties on Sunday morning, attending the launch of the National Coastal Safety report, despite admitting last week that the government had been performing in a 'ragged' way recently. The Prime Minister was still convinced of the ability of his office, however, and said that it remained a solid force. 'This is the same office which ran a very effective opposition, it's the same office which has got an enormous amount done this year sometimes under very difficult circumstances,' he said. Mr Abbott is no stranger to accusations of sexism, having been famously savaged by then Prime Minister Julia Gillard when he was Opposition Leader. 'I will not be lectured on sexism or misogny by this man,' Ms Gillard said of Mr Abbott's perceived attitudes to women in a speech that soon went viral. 'I shouldn't have done it, Karl': Mr Abbott later apologised after he winked at a radio presenter when a caller announced she was a sex worker . Mr Abbott's appearance at a 2011 anti-carbon tax rally in front of signs reading 'Ditch the witch' and 'Julia is Bob Brown's b****' was similarly controversial. And in May, Mr Abbott was forced to apologise after he winked at ABC Radio presenter Jon Faine when a talkback caller announced she was a sex worker. Late last week, the Australian Financial Review reported that Ms Bishop 'went bananas' at Mr Abbott when she was not consulted about a plan for a male colleague to 'chaperone' her to a climate change conference in Lima, Peru. It was claimed Trade Minister Andrew Robb was accompanying Ms Bishop to ensure Australia did not over-commit on his climate change policy promises. The bust-ups have overshadowed a significant announcement in Lima by Ms Bishop that Australia will contribute $200 million to a global fund to help poorer nations tackle climate change.","The Prime Minister believes public attacks on his chief advisor Peta Credlin are motivated by sexism .

"A senior judge has condemned pre-nuptial agreements claiming that the only reason people want them is to give their partner less than they are entitled to in the event of a marital breakthrough. Baroness Hale of Richmond was commenting after one leading family law firm said that the demand for such documents has increased by 50 per cent. The Law Reform Commission also recommended back in February that pre-nuptial agreements should be made legally binding in English courts. Baroness Hale of Richmond, pictured, cautioned against the use of pre-nuptial agreements . Justice secretary Chris Grayling has already commented that implementing such agreements is a sensible proposition. Baroness Hale said: 'I am very suspicious of prenuptial agreements' as they are designed 'almost always to give someone less than they would be otherwise entitled to'. Charlotte Leyson, family solicitor at Hughes James told The Times: 'Prenups are no longer just used by oligarchs or celebrities looking to protect vast wealth. Since the publicity around the Law Commission's recommendations, people have more confidence that a pre-nuptial agreement could be taken seriously by the courts. 'Younger people in particular are becoming more pragmatic about prenups. It is not about a lack of trust or an expectation that the marriage will fail - they recognise that by thinking ahead about what financial responsibilities they would face in the event of a divorce, they can  reduce the possibility of an acrimonious and expensive break-up in the future. 'Anyone who has assets to protect is starting to view the prenup as a sensible precaution, a bit like making a will.' Earlier this year when the prenuptial agreement proposals were published, Professor Elizabeth Cooke, Law Commissioner for property, family and trust law, said: 'Pre- and post-nuptial agreements are becoming more commonplace but the courts will not always follow them and lawyers are therefore not able to give clear advice about their effect. 'The measures we are recommending would help couples understand and meet their financial responsibilities and, where appropriate, achieve financial independence.'","Baroness Hale of Richmond has warned against   pre-nuptial agreements .

"One of Britain’s most famous athletes was last night drawn into an investigation after it was claimed that the sport’s governing body failed to act upon ‘suspicious’ drugs test samples. Dick Pound, a former chairman of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA), told The Mail on Sunday he had been asked to lead an inquiry into allegations that hundreds of abnormal readings could indicate doping was covered up. In a scandal now engulfing the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF), 225 athletes from 39 countries were revealed to have produced anomalous blood readings. They include three British athletes – one of whom is a household name and a star of track and field events. Dick Pound, a former chairman of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA), said he had been asked to lead an inquiry into allegations that hundreds of abnormal readings could indicate doping was covered up . The star’s name appears on a leaked list of 65 athletes whose tests scores were labelled ‘Suspicion Red’ – which experts say should have triggered an automatic check for the banned drug EPO. The drug helps deliver oxygen to muscles by stimulating the production of red blood cells. But amid mounting concerns that the IAAF did not conduct follow-up tests on most or all of the sportsmen and women, Mr Pound – one of the sport’s most senior figures – has been approached to establish what happened to the results. He said: ‘What I understood… was that a great number of cases came back and were short of something that could be declared positive, but whoever had done the analysis clearly thought that there was something afoot.’ The British star has so far declined to comment, yet the scandal has already claimed several high-ranking executives and shows little sign of abating. The ‘Suspicion Red’ list is among a cache of documents sourced by The Mail on Sunday and said to have come from a whistleblower at the IAAF’s Medical Commission. Although undated, the list is said to have been compiled between 2006 and 2008 before the introduction into athletics of much stricter tests for banned substances. Under suspicion: British athletes are on the list . It has been argued that it is unlikely any readings taken during this period could be used to investigate athletes retrospectively, but Mr Pound said it may be possible to uncover past violations of cheating if these readings are used in conjunction with frozen samples. While being named on the list does not provide conclusive evidence that the British star was taking banned substances, experts have said it raises serious questions about whether proper checks were made. Elsewhere in the documents are more detailed lists which do not mention the British athlete, but do suggest that World and Olympic champions showed abnormal blood values that strongly suggest the use of performance-enhancing drugs. These more detailed documents relate to tests taken between 2001 and 2006. The two other Britons named are less high-profile, and the level of suspicion is lower and coded ‘orange.’ The IAAF does not dispute the authenticity of the information, which was first obtained by the German television station WDR and broadcast in a documentary last month. But it says it may not prove the stars had been cheating and suggested other factors might have produced high test results. However, last night the former head of Jamaica’s anti-doping commission described the IAAF’s response to the scandal as ‘completely unsatisfactory’ and suggested there was more to the list ‘than we are being told’. Renee Anne Shirley, a respected campaigner for transparency in sport, added that the existence of the ‘red’ list ‘raises serious concerns about what happened next’. She said: ‘That is the real issue here. Being on such a list in the first place is in itself indicative that something irregular has been flagged up. ‘Did the IAAF target test the people on this list, as I would expect should have been the case, or not? And if not, why not? ‘I think there is more to this list than we have been told and the IAAF’s response so far is completely unsatisfactory. What did they find when they did further investigation? Did they in fact do anything? ‘With everything going on and so much uncertainty, it is simply unsatisfactory to say there is no problem and expect people to accept that blindly.’ Many of the names listed in the documents are accompanied by detailed readings of their blood values, with figures appearing under various headings. For instance, one is ‘hgb’ – haemoglobin, which transports oxygen in the blood. The documents also record the altitude level – which can affect red blood cell count – at which the tests took place. Together, the results produce an overall figure known as the ‘off score’ level and anything over 125 is considered to be a marker of potential doping. The documents show that the highest ‘off score’ level for a male athlete was 167.63 – considered to be extraordinarily high – yet there is no record that he was charged with a doping offence. The highest ‘off score’ level for a female athlete is 170.03 and again there is no public record of the athlete being charged. More than a quarter of the athletes named in documents are Russian, lending credence to claims that Moscow operated an ‘East German-style’ doping regime. There is also a high number of Kenyans on the lists. The British star has so far declined to comment, yet the scandal has already claimed several high-ranking executives and shows little sign of abating . The IAAF has claimed that it did follow up ‘suspicious’ readings of blood levels and exonerated many of the names. It emphasised the appearance of a name on a list marking suspicion did not indicate that a doping offence had taken place. IAAF general secretary Nick Davies has insisted that the mere presence of a suspicious value does not indicate a positive test, and that the information provided by the documents ‘was partial and misleading.’ He has also said in a statement that: ‘Athletes with a “red flag” reading may well be guilty of doping but equally – and we can prove it in the vast majority of cases – they may be innocent, which is why this information should have stayed locked up in a safe.’ Last night, he told The Mail on Sunday in an email: ‘We welcome the intervention of WADA. In all our statements we have underlined that we will co-operate totally with WADA.’ Asked whether he believed the IAAF had followed up suspicious blood readings, he replied: ‘Yes – but let WADA do their work now.’ Mr Pound said WADA's inquiry has 'resulted from pretty extensive publication of materials that look pretty serious' Mr Pound will establish the terms of reference for the WADA inquiry before deciding whether to accept the invitation to lead it. He said: ‘WADA has a general monitoring responsibility with respect to international standards and with respect to the anti-doping code. ‘We are meant to do that and it’s part of our mandate. And this is a specific inquiry that has resulted from pretty extensive publication of materials that look pretty serious. ‘I think our stakeholders, the IOC, the international federations and the public authorities, would expect us to do something and our chairman has responded by saying yes indeed we agree and will set up a commission and give it the neces- sary resources to do whatever has to be done.’ There is already a separate IAAF ethics commission inquiry into the doping lists. Last week three key IAAF figures – treasurer Valetin Balaknichev, marketing consultant Massata Papa Diack, and legal adviser Habib Cisse – agreed to stand down while allegations against them were investigated by the ethics committee.","Dick Pound is a a former chairman of the World Anti-Doping Agency .

"If being pooped-on from the heavens is a sign of good luck, you could say Sydney artist Emilio Cresciani has had a good run - at least when it comes to a supply of ready-made canvases. The artist says he became fascinated with patterns of bird droppings on city pavements after a family holiday to Venice some years ago. So he started photographing them. 'I know it's not a subject that many people would think of as art, but really, nature is the source and place of all creativity,' says Cresciani. 'Natural forms have their own beauty and it's the randomness of the patterns that inspired me.' His collection of black-and-white images, Flight Patterns, is now on show at the MARS Gallery in Toowoomba, Queensland. Cresciani says the images, taken in-and-around Sydney, including Hyde Park, Central Station and Manly, remind him of Jackson Pollock's  expressionist works and have even been called 'White Poles' by one fan. 'The patterns are a natural landscape, overlaid on a man-made landscape,' says Cresciani. 'It also continues my interest in waste and the things that we overlook in our everyday lives.'

"Deep in north-eastern Poland, a neglected airstrip has been identified as a key staging post in the CIA’s clandestine torture programme. For the first time, a detailed picture of how the CIA flew terror suspects into Szymany and on to a nearby ‘dark site’ for brutal interrogations has emerged. In an exclusive interview with The Mail on Sunday, the airport’s former managing director Mariola Przewlocka reveals: . Scroll down for video . Ashamed: Mariola Przewlocka, who spoke exclusively to the Mail on Sunday, at the entrance to Szymany airport . Known by its codename ‘Detention Site Blue’, Szymany airport – which is 100 miles from Warsaw – was the destination for several terror suspects on unmarked civilian planes. They were hooded, handcuffed and shackled for ‘enhanced interrogation’ at nearby Stare Kiejkuty base. The detainees would arrive, sometimes in the dead of night, in aircraft owned by CIA ‘shell companies’. Some of the most brutal torture sessions in the CIA’s murky war against terror took place near this forbidding spot. Mrs Przewlocka, who ran Szymany airport at the time, told of her shock at discovering she may have seen the arrival of the CIA’s most high-value prisoner, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed. Known as KSM to the CIA, he was waterboarded no fewer than 183 times by his captors, both during his six months in Poland and at other CIA facilities. The Mail on Sunday has learned that the Gulfstream executive jet which ‘dropped off’ KSM in Poland then went on to stay overnight at Glasgow airport, where it stopped for 24 hours, presumably to allow the flight crew to rest. The role of Szymany airport was highlighted in last week’s US Senate Intelligence Committee on CIA renditions. After being flown here, prisoners were transferred 13 miles on near-deserted roads to Stare Kiejkuty, where they were tortured. Mrs Przewlocka realised the clandestine activity signified some kind of undercover operations being conducted but had no idea the facility was being used for ‘extraordinary rendition’. The 57-year-old grandmother became suspicious after traffic to the airport suddenly picked up in late 2002. ‘The airport wasn’t doing well economically, operations were being run down,’ she recalled. From December 2002, however, as President George W. Bush’s ‘war on terror’ escalated, the small planes she was used to seeing gave way to much bigger jets which thundered dangerously down the runway. Szymany Airport, 100 miles from Warsaw, was known by codename Detention Site Blue . ‘On one occasion the airport director told me a “special” flight was due to arrive the next day and it had to be given landing permission at any cost. I told him that wouldn’t be possible as there had been a lot of snow. ‘He said something like, “Don’t worry about that, bring in an outside contractor. However much it costs, we will pay”. When the plane touched down, it turned out to be an American-owned Gulfstream jet, which we’d never seen before at the airport. The customs staff were told to go home and a border police unit was brought in for the day, which was extremely unusual. ‘Two military cars from the intelligence base at Stare Kiejkuty drove up to the aircraft and after a few minutes returned to the airport building and then went out through the main gate. We couldn’t see what was going on because the cars had darkened windows. I assumed the flight was bringing in secret agents.’ The view of the tower on the airport in Szczytno . KSM told a US military tribunal he saw snow when the plane bringing him from Afghanistan stopped over in Europe. Mrs Przewlocka now believes she may have been at Szymany when the Al Qaeda terrorist’s plane touched down. She is unsure of the date, but independent records show his flight almost certainly arrived at Szymany on March 7, 2003. ‘I have my suspicions that this was the flight which we were under orders to accept at any cost,’ she said. ‘Everything was hidden from us.’ Mrs Przewlocka recalled a Polish civilian official who would always take care of landing fees in cash. ‘They would pay up to six times the normal charge for a civilian aircraft and we were instructed to keep away and ask no questions.’ The normal landing fee of around £380 could soar up to £2,300 for the flights, she said. On one occasion, Mrs Pzewlocka noticed a quiet American woman in the background when a flight came in. She recalled: ‘She was smartly dressed and didn’t speak to us but we were told she was from the American embassy. She waited near the office in the airport building and didn’t go near the planes. It was as if she didn’t want to know too much about what was going on.’ On September 22, 2003, a Boeing 737 was given permission to land at Szymany, although the runway was unsuitable for an aircraft of this size. Mrs Przewlocka said the flight plan indicated it had come from Kabul and was scheduled to refuel at Warsaw’s main civilian airport before going on to Guantanamo Bay. ‘This was inexplicable because if it could get to Szymany why couldn’t it fly directly to Warsaw which is only 100 miles or so away? ‘We should not have accepted the flight – there weren’t even any firefighters on duty, which is illegal – but we were given no choice. Once again, two military vehicles went out to meet it, waited for a few moments at the aircraft steps and then headed in the direction of Stare Kiejkuty. I saw several more 737s after that.’ The Senate report reveals the Polish authorities initially refused to allow KSM into the country, claiming they had accepted enough prisoners on behalf of the Americans already. But their stance crumbled when the US ambassador personally intervened with the government in Warsaw, followed by a CIA delivery of $15 million in cash, after which Polish officials assured the Americans they would be more flexible. Research by the Rendition Project, a collaboration between academics at Kent and Kingston universities, has pieced together the journey followed by the plane almost certainly carrying KSM – a Gulfstream V jet, code-number N379P and owned by a CIA company. Records show that on March 7, the plane arrived at Szymany with two passengers and two crew. It stayed on the ground for two and a half hours, then flew to Prague, stopping for an hour, before flying to Glasgow where it stopped for over 24 hours. On the morning of March 9, the aircraft left for Washington. Mrs Przewlocka said: ‘I feel a deep sense of shame that politicians let this to happen. This has left a terrible stain on my country.’","Detailed picture of how CIA flew terror suspects to Szymany has emerged .

"Pledge: Yodel executive chairman Dick Stead has apologised for the delay in deliveries and claimed the company will soon be back on track . The boss of a major courier firm has promised customers hit by delays to deliveries in the lead up to Christmas: 'We will get back on track.' Yodel, the second largest delivery firm in the UK and used by a string of major stores, was forced to temporarily suspend new collections from retailers and admitted parcels may be delayed by up to three days as it struggled to cope with a surge of online orders on Black Friday and Cyber Monday. Today the company's executive chairman Dick Stead apologised for the problems. He told the BBC: 'I had a phone call from a gentleman who unfortunately had waited eight days for his parcel and that's totally unacceptable. 'You have to remember that from the point of order to delivery there are a number of points in that chain. 'Whatever, the retailers and the parcel companies as an industry as a whole -we've got to do better under this circumstances. 'Again, I say apologies but we will get it back on track.' Yodel is one of the couriers used by firms including Amazon, Waterstones and Boots. The delivery firm's Twitter feed was awash with complaints from customers. Cathy Bussey said: 'Poor service from @YodelOnline. No parcels, no card thru door, no response to my tweet for help.' Ryan Thomas tweeted: 'Has anyone ever received a order when delivered by yodel? Horrendous service.' Another customer wrote: 'My delivery was due on the 8th, still not arrived & still no update on your website... Update please?!' In an update posted on its website on Friday Yodel insisted that its delivery service has not been suspended and parcels will continue to be distributed over the weekend. It added: 'Today, we have re-commenced many collections from our clients, with the remainder coming back on line no later than Monday. Yodel, the second largest delivery firm in the UK and used by a string of major stores, has struggled to cope with the surge of online orders on Black Friday and Cyber Monday . Waterstone's, which uses Yodel's services, has seen significant delays in the deliveries of parcels . 'We are working with all our clients to manage the flow of new volume into our network. By Monday we expect to resume our normal service.' Amazon customers took to a forum on the site to express their frustrations at orders due to be delivered by Yodel. Couriers for Yodel are paid as little as 50p per delivery and must deliver up to 160 parcels a day, it is claimed. Yodel, voted the worst parcel service in the UK, delivers for firms from Amazon and Waterstones to Boots and Argos. But complaints have stacked up in the wake of Black Friday and Cyber Monday. There are claims of items left in bushes, in bins or with unknown neighbours, and of deliveries at night. Now stories have emerged of drivers paid just a few pence per parcel. On an online forum where staff rate employers, a man in Nottingham said he was offered the equivalent of 50p a parcel. He said: ‘How they expect you to earn even a half decent wage is beyond me.’ He worked out that by delivering one parcel every six to eight minutes, he would earn £2.50 an hour after deducting petrol, which seasonal couriers must buy. Job ads for seasonal drivers say they work ‘at some pace’, warning: ‘It’s no mean feat.’ A Scottish driver, who spent seven years at Yodel until 2012, said: ‘December is always the worst time. Some workers were out until 10pm. The workers had a target . . . it ranged from 110-160 parcels a day. You couldn’t bring back more than 2 per cent. Guys were coming back with 20 to 30 parcels saying they couldn’t do it. A lot of the workers were off with stress.’ Customers were just as unhappy. Twitter user ‘Yodelhell’ said: ‘All we want is our packages delivered intact. Is it too much to ask?’ Rachel Webber said her order showed she missed a delivery at 1am. She said: ‘I am going to assume I was asleep.’ Yodel said deliveries should be no later than 9pm. A spokesman said many workers had a regular salary but some were self-employed and paid per delivery. Dave Fletcher wrote: 'My TV was delivered at 10pm and 3 days late! I'm now waiting for a mattress topper which is 2 days delayed!' Another said: 'Ordered a Sealey (emergency power pack) for Prime delivery, supposed to arrive Monday. 'By Wednesday still nothing arrived although Yodel tracking said it was in the same town.' An Amazon spokesman said: 'Amazon orders continue to be processed and delivered in the normal timeframe. For example, Prime customers can order for next day delivery.' Waterstones customers were also reporting problems. Mary Novakovich tweeted: 'Just discovered that my @Waterstones parcel has been sent via @YodelOnline - and it's been delayed. Now there's a surprise. *grinds teeth*' In response to one query, Waterstones said: 'Yodel are currently handling more parcels than they expected, so some deliveries are taking longer than we would like.Very sorry if this affects your order.' A spokeswoman for Boots said: 'We know how important it is for our customers, particularly at this time of year, to get their packages delivered on time, which is why our delivery system is set up using a multi-carrier strategy. 'This involves using some third party carriers and our own transportation system, meaning we have agility to be able to quickly switch volumes between carriers to ensure continuity and maximum opportunity for delivery to our customers.' Marks & Spencer has also been hit by unrelated problems, with customers warned that standard delivery could take up to nine days - four days longer than normal. A spokeswoman said: 'Our customer is always our top priority and that is why we've extended some of our delivery options. The vast majority of orders are delivered on time.' Which? executive director Richard Lloyd, said: 'Consumers tell us they are put off buying online because of delivery issues, which is why we're campaigning to Stamp Out Dodgy Deliveries. We want to see retailers make sure delivery services are first class, first time.' Amazon whose Swansea, Wales, warehouse is pictured above, recently announced that their delivery service had been delayed by 'the unprecedented number of orders received during Black Friday Deals Week' Delivery firms blamed the chaos on a massive increase in online shopping, fuelled by record sales on Black Friday two weeks ago. pictured, customers shove eachother at Black Friday Sales in Asda, Wembley .","Yodel is struggling to cope with huge volume of orders in last two weeks .

"The old saying goes that nice guys finish last. But Andy Lee made a mockery of that, and the bookmakers here in Las Vegas, to become the new middleweight champion of the world on an emotionally charged evening on the strip. And, although he might not describe it as such, there was a sense that the popular 30-year-old fulfilled his destiny in front of the widow of his former trainer, the legendary Emanuel Steward at the Chelsea arena inside the Cosmopolitan Hotel. VIDEO Scroll down for Andy Lee: I dedicate victory to Emanuel Steward and Adam Booth . Andy Lee celebrates his win over Matt Korobov after their fight for the vacant WBO middleweight title . Lee lands a left hand on Korobov as he came into his own as the fight approached the halfway mark . It was Steward who took Lee under his wing, immersed him in his famous Kronk philosophy in Detroit, even let him stay at his home after they met in 2002. Steward guided Lee through his formative years as a professional and even up until his first challenge for a world title, the unsuccessful attempt to wrestle the WBC title from Julio Cesar Chavez Jr in 2012. But Lee was forced to go it alone four months later when Steward passed away until he linked up with Adam Booth, who was in the corner here, and the brains behind Lee's preparation for this shot at the WBO title. Lee admitted in the week, in the suite 45 floors above the venue, that a defeat here would likely end his career, with no desire to fight his way back from another failed title challenge. He also said that he was completely confident of beating undefeated Matt Korobov. Referee Kenny Bayless steps in to end the fight as Korobov looks stunned while Lee races to celebrate . Until Lee stopped the unbeaten man, the fight had been tentative with neither fighter able to make his mark . And he showed exactly why in the sixth round of this contest, which was otherwise tentative, quiet and cagey. In fact, the only moment of note before the stoppage was when Lee momentarily stiffened the Russian with a left hand in the centre of the ring. It was a sign of things to come. In the sixth round, Lee shipped a left hand but, almost immediately, connected with a right hook that is swiftly becoming his trademark. Korobov tottered, stunned from the impact, and Lee did not waste a second, swarming the 31-year-old. Referee Kenny Bayliss waved it off quickly. The celebrations were passionate as Lee, truly one of boxing's good guys, embraced his new trainer Booth. His wife was also hoisted into the ring to join the new WBO champion. He is the first Irish middleweight to clinch a world title since Steve Collins who, 20 years ago, won this very belt. He is also the first man from the travelling community to win a world title in the history of professional boxing. The decisive moment came when Lee landed a right hand which rocked Korobov to his core . Korobov had edged the opening stages but had no answer when Lee landed the big shot in the sixth session . Speaking of the travelling community, this victory also sets up a mouth-watering contest between Lee and Billy Joe Saunders, who is the mandatory challenger for the new WBO king. That is one to look forward to next year, but for now, Lee and his team should savour this moment and their achievement against the odds in this famous gambling district. When asked how to sum up the feeling of becoming champion, he said: 'It's tough to describe. When I thought about this moment, I had a speech in mind. 'I would like to say than you to my manger who has done so much for me over the last couple of years.' But then Lee paid a poignant tribute to Steward, whose widow Marie was in attendance for the bout, along with a clutch of other Detroit natives who cheered Lee on from the crowd. He went on: 'But it's also for the man who made me, Emanuel Steward. 'We spent seven or eight years together and he said I would win a world title. The fight heats up in the middle of the ring and Lee was soon to finish it altogether with his stoppage . Korobov lunges forward and tries to land a left hand on Lee as he battles during their world title fight . 'His wife Marie came here today, flew all the way from Detroit so from everybody from Detroit and Kronk, thank you very much. 'Matt Korobov was giving me nightmares but i could hear all the cheers from all that came to see me from New York and Detroit. 'We were trading and a lot of the times he was having the better of it but my right hook is a killer punch I thought he wasn't going down but i wasn't taking any chances.' Lee dedicated his world title win to former trainer Emanuel Steward - who died in 2012 . And what of that showdown with Saunders? 'I am a champion now and I want to defend my belt in Ireland,' he said. But, for now, it's back to Ireland to celebrate a Christmas as world champion.","Andy Lee recovers from a slow start to stop Matt Korobov .

"It’s the kind of encounter that would cause most adults to squirm in fear or run out of the room screaming. But the cool-headed two-year-old boy in this video shows no fear as he allows a large spider to crawl all over his body. Joshua – wearing a Spider-Man shirt – is bolder than most grown-ups as he gleefully takes the spider into his hand at his family’s home in Essex. Two-year-old Joshua allows the spider to crawl onto his shoulder and across his back . Joshua's father, Robert, holds the spider after scooping it off his son's back . The 40-second clip uploaded to YouTube shows the spider crawling along the back of the young boy’s black shirt after his father, Robert, gives it a nudge. After Robert scoops it up, he shows it off to the camera and then carefully passes it to his son. The spider then crawls along Joshua’s arm, across his chest and onto his left shoulder. Joshua shows no fear as he gleefully scoops the spider out of his father's hand . With nerves of steel, it’s obvious that Joshua has done this before. The boy isn’t afraid of spiders or insects, and he proved it during the family’s holiday in Florida last April when he volunteered to hold a tarantula. No fear: When the family went on holiday in Florida earlier this year Joshua volunteered to hold a tarantula . The spider in this video had been haunting his mother, Kara, for more than a week. She screamed and ran away when she first spotted it while picking up the washing basket. Robert picked it up and passed it to his son after they spotted it in their living room last month. No harm came to the spider, as they later freed it in their garden.","Joshua allows spider to crawl across his back and up his arm .

Starring Dame Judi Dench and Dustin Hoffman, the BBC adaptation of Roald Dahl’s Esio Trot is set to be one of the festive TV highlights. And now the meeting that inspired the story of pensioners who find love through a tortoise is revealed for the first time. Dahl hit upon the idea when he visited the London flat of his eldest daughter Tessa in the 1970s, and watched as she chatted to neighbour Mrs Shrimpton and her pet tortoise. In a speech given to students at Wright State University in the United States, Dahl said: ‘I stood leaning over the balcony staring at Mrs Shrimpton’s tortoise in his box. And quite automatically my mind began to wiggle around with a story about this tortoise. The only point in telling you this is to try to illustrate how the mind of a writer of fantasy works. It is eager to embrace what is absurd.’ Esio Trot – ‘tortoise’ spelled backwards – is the story of Mr Hoppy (Hoffman), who is in love with his neighbour, Mrs Silver (Dame Judi). He realises he can win her heart if he helps her pet tortoise, Alfie, to grow bigger – only to fail and then replace it with a series of bigger tortoises. Rachel White, of the Roald Dahl Museum, said the speech – made in 1978, 12 years before Esio Trot was published – provided a unique insight into his work processes: ‘He’d have ideas but they’d sit in the back of his mind for years.’ The museum in Great Missenden, Buckinghamshire, will be displaying the speech from January 13 next year.

"Stephen Curtis, a friend of impaled tycoon Scot Young, was killed in a helicopter crash in 2004, with the pilot's family blaming the Russian government . A lawyer who was close friends with impaled tycoon Scot Young spoke of his fear for his life just days before he died in a mysterious helicopter crash. Stephen Curtis was killed in the crash a mile from Bournemouth Airport in 2004, but the family of the pilot say the Russian government is to blame. Just a week before he died, Mr Curtis, 45, told a friend: 'If anything happens to me in the next few weeks, it will not be an accident.' Mr Curtis becomes the sixth member of the mysterious 'ring of death' that has emerged since Mr Young died in a fall from his London penthouse on Monday. Last night relatives of the pilot who also died in the horrific crash told The Sun that they suspect Russians working for President Vladimir Putin were involved. Scotland Yard said there were no suspicious circumstances at the time and referred the deaths of Mr Curtis and pilot Max Radford, 34, to a coroner, who ruled he lost his bearings in torrid weather. Mr Radford's mother, Gloria, 72, said: 'It was no pilot error - that is balderdash.' She said that father-of-one Mr Curtis, who owned the £1.5million aircraft, was working for Russian oil oligarch and Putin foe Mikhail Khodorkovsky. She added: 'I know Putin wanted these oligarchs because they got so much of the country's money. 'Stephen Curtis was helping them to get their money invested in the tax havens.' Mr Curtis, estimated to be worth £100million, is the sixth member of a close-knit group of wealthy businessmen to die in odd circumstances. Mr Young, who suffered fatal injuries after falling from a window of his London penthouse on to railings on Monday, is said to have lost his fortune in a secretive property development called Project Moscow. Just a week before the fatal crash near Bournemouth, Mr Curtis, told a friend: 'If anything happens to me in the next few weeks, it will not be an accident' Mr Curtis' widow Sarah and daughter Louise follow his coffin before the multi-millionaire lawyer's funeral . The 'Ring of Death' includes Mr Curtis and Paul Castle, an entrepreneur who played polo with Prince Charles, who also invested in the scheme. Boris Berezovsky, who is said to have been running Project Moscow but did not appear to know it was a scam, was found dead after an apparent suicide. Police are being urged to investigate a 'ring of death' surrounding 52-year-old Scot Young (pictured with his girlfriend Noelle Reno), who died on Monday after a fall from his London penthouse . The ex-husband of Trinny Woodall, Johnny Elichaoff, died last month after falling from a shopping centre in west London and was friends with some of the others who died in mysterious fashion. An anonymous source told the Telegraph that the Russians may not have killed some of the tycoons, but that they were 'bullied' to their deaths'. 'There is no doubt some of them did commit suicide,' he said. 'Scot had been a broken man over the last few years but they were all caught up with very, very nasty people. 'Paul Castle was so frightened. They visited him and he handed over his whole watch collection to appease them. 'They said if he did not pay up he would be killed, not by a shot to the head but in a slow nasty way. He then went straight to Bond Street Station and killed himself.' A friend of Mr Young’s claimed on Friday that the businessman was hounded over debts in the months before his death by Russian mafia members. They had previously dangled him out of a window at the Dorchester Hotel, in Park Lane, threatening to drop him next time if he did not pay up, the friend alleged. The man, who asked not to be named, said police should urgently investigate the death of Young, 52, and his associates. ‘There were five friends who all ate together at Cipriani [now called C London] who are all now dead. They were all linked in business and all owed a lot of money to the wrong people,' the source said. ‘I’m absolutely devastated. He [Scot] was a really nice guy. I think they have been murdered or forced to take themselves out.’ Tragedy: Young fell 60ft onto the iron railings below his flat in Marylebone in London on Monday . The Russian exile who fled for Britain fearing for his life . Oligarch Boris Berezovsky was found dead in the bathroom of his Berkshire home in March last year – after fleeing Russia fearing for his life. The 67-year-old businessman amassed a huge fortune after the Soviet Union collapsed and state assets were privatised. But after a high profile falling out with Russian President Vladimir Putin, he was granted political asylum in the UK in 2003. During his life, Mr Berezovsky survived many assassination attempts, including a bomb which decapitated his chauffeur. In 2012, he lost a £3 billion damages claim against Chelsea Football Club owner Roman Abramovich in 2012, after which he told family members he feared he had been poisoned. Mr Berezovsky was also one of the investors who, alongside Scot Young, lost a lot of money in a mysterious property deal in Russia named ‘Project Moscow’. In March, he was found hanged by a scarf and police investigated possible foul play. It was later declared that there had been no sign of a struggle – even though an expert speaking at the inquest into his death said he could not have killed himself. Professor Bernd Brinkmann, who deals with hanging and asphyxiation cases, claimed the marks on the oligarch’s neck indicated he had been killed. Mr Berezovsky was more likely to have been strangled by someone else and then hanged from the shower rail in the bathroom, he said. His daughter Elizaveta Berezovskaya told the inquest she feared he was assassinated for warning that Mr Putin was a ‘danger to the world’. Trinny’s Woodall's ex who friends 'cannot comprehend' would kill himself . Financial adviser Johnny Elichaoff, who used to be married to TV presenter Trinny Woodall, died last month after falling from the roof of a London shopping centre. The 55-year-old was a drummer and managed rock bands such as Fairground Attraction before getting involved in business. He became friendly with Scot Young through his work as a financial advisor but had also hit hard times – first divorcing his TV presenter wife in 2009, before more recently being forced to sell his businesses. Just weeks before his death at Whiteleys shopping centre in west London, he had been talked down from the same roof. Friends said they were devastated, but could not comprehend that he would have wanted to take his own life. The tycoon who dated Caprice but lost it all and fell under Tube train . Millionaire property tycoon Robert Curtis is another friend of Young’s who was killed in recent years. The 47-year-old businessman, who used to date model Caprice, died after being hit by a train in North West London two years ago. He had made his money in the 2000s alongside Mr Young in the London property market and was known for his lavish lifestyle, expensive cars and designer wardrobe. At the height of his success, he was the director of 15 firms and worked from an office in upmarket St John’s Wood, near Lord’s cricket ground, while being chauffeured in a Rolls Royce with a personalised number plate. The money suddenly dried up in recent years, though, and he faced huge debts. All but one of his companies folded. Before his death, the father-of-one had moved out of home and was living in a Travelodge hotel in Whetstone, North London. He had £25 cash in his pocket when he was killed by a southbound Jubilee Line train at Kingsbury station in North West London. The polo fan who played with Prince Charles and died near his London office . Entrepreneur Paul Castle also died after being hit by a Tube train. The tycoon, 54, had come from little money and had few qualifications but managed to make a fortune in property and flew between homes in the UK, France and Switzerland in his private plane. Mixing with elite crowds, he boasted of playing polo with Prince Charles and was photographed shaking hands with the Queen after the match. The father-of-two had been married three times and was due to marry his fourth wife but was apparently hit badly by the recession. Mr Castle, who is said to have socialised with Mr Young at London’s exclusive Cipriani restaurant, was killed in 2010. He was found under a carriage at Bond Street, near his London office.","Stephen Curtis feared for his life before fatal helicopter crash in 2004 .

"The Senate has passed an extension of federal spending authority that will last until midnight on Wednesday, staving off the threat of a government shutdown that could have been triggered by early Sunday. The controversial move, approved by voice vote on Saturday, will give leaders three days to agree on a $1.1 trillion spending bill to fund all government agencies except the Department for Homeland Security until September 2015. Senators were called to the rare weekend session after Republican Sen Ted Cruz blocked  the sweeping motion. Extension: The Senate approved an extension until Wednesday night for the $1.1 trillion spending bill . The move - defying his party's leadership - was an apparent bid to sabotage President Obama's immigration plans as a band of conservative Republicans called to immediately defund the program. Senate Majority Leader Harry M Reid (D-Nev) slammed opponents of the bill, telling the House on Friday: 'I would hope cooler heads prevail and we can move forward and get this done.' There were fears even the extension could be scuppered as negotiations between Democrats and Republicans to speed the process along collapsed during late-night talks in the nearly abandoned U.S. Capitol. Some senators, angered over the bill's easing of a 'Dodd-Frank' bank regulation law requirement, wanted a shot at removing the provision. The 1,603-page spending bill, negotiated by Republican and Democratic appropriators and leaders, narrowly passed the House on Thursday following a battle that exposed fraying unity in Obama's Democratic Party. A revolt over financial provisions by House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi, long a staunch Obama ally, led to a day of tension on Capitol Hill on Thursday. Talks broke down: Senate Majority Leader Harry M Reid called for 'cooler heads to prevail' in the House . Democrats, aware of the need for unity when Republicans take full control of Congress next year after their midterm election gains, tried to tamp down speculation of a lasting split between Obama and Pelosi. One leadership aide said Pelosi had fired a warning shot to Republicans that House Democrats would fight hard in the new year. In the 219-206 House vote, 67 Republicans rejected the spending bill, largely because it failed to take action to stop Obama's immigration order. But that was offset by 57 Democrats who voted in favor. The spending bill would fund all government agencies through September 2015, except for the Department of Homeland Security, which would get an extension only until February 27. That is the department mainly in charge of implementing the order announced by Obama last month.","Senators now have until Wednesday to agree on $1.1 trillion spending bill .

"Teenagers behind bars are getting a better education than thousands of pupils in ordinary schools, according to official watchdogs. Inmates at a Young Offenders’ Institution in the North-West received ‘outstanding’ teaching and English and maths scores were ‘above the national average’, inspectors found. Behaviour was also described as ‘very good’. It is the first time a YOI has had such a glowing assessment. Ofsted and HM Inspector of Prisons said the standard of education in YOI Hindley near Wigan was ‘as good, if not better’ than many children receive in schools and colleges. Scroll down for video . Top Marks: The standard of education at  Hindley Young Offenders' Institution near Wigan was ‘as good, if not better’ than many children receive in schools and colleges . Critics said it showed how pupils in state schools were being let down by a lack of discipline in the classroom. Chris McGovern, a former Ofsted inspector who chairs the Campaign for Real Education, said: ‘Well done to the Young Offender Institution but what an indictment of the education system in England if it can produce better teaching than schools.’ He said the YOI would probably have a better ratio of teachers to pupils than regular schools, but that the key difference would probably be in discipline. ‘There will be a much greater emphasis on good order. Chaos reigns in many classrooms – restoring order would have the biggest impact on raising standards in our schools. Teachers need to be re-trained in class control methods.’ Critics said it showed how pupils in state schools were being let down by a lack of discipline in the classroom (picture posed by models) Ofsted rated all aspects of learning, skills and work at Hindley as ‘good’. The report said the quality of some teaching was ‘outstanding’, with teachers having ‘high aspirations’ for their charges while poor behaviour was ‘isolated’. Inmates could gain vocational qualifications in bricklaying and plastering, gain ‘valuable fork-lift truck driving licences’ and get experience in garden maintenance. Thirteen of the boys in the YOI achieved 26 GCSEs between them, and there was ‘outstanding’ work created in art and bricklaying. The inmates have access to a football and rugby field, a weights room and sports hall, with some taking part in PE five times a week. Nick Hardwick, HM Chief Inspector of Prisons, wrote that the teaching ‘motivated boys who had been failed by the ordinary school system’. Inmates at a Young Offenders’ Institution in the North-West received ‘outstanding’ teaching and English and maths scores were ‘above the national average’, inspectors found . When contacted by the MoS, the prisons inspectorate said Hindley was being compared with poorly performing schools nationwide, not those nearby in Wigan. Local Labour MP Yvonne Fovargue said: ‘I think all children deserve a good education and am pleased it is provided both for local children and those within the YOI.’ The local authority said its schools had recently received glowing Ofsted reports. A Department for Education spokesperson said: “Our plan for education has already transformed discipline in schools. Thousands fewer pupils are being bullied, fewer pupils are skipping lessons than ever before, and more teachers tell us that behaviour is good or better in their schools than in 2008. “Teachers can now properly discipline disruptive pupils and exclude the worst behaved pupils which will benefit all by deterring poor behaviour and freeing up teachers’ time and energy, allowing them to focus on what they do best – teaching and inspiring our next generation. “Under this government there are a million more children in good or outstanding schools and a 60 per cent increase in the proportion of young people studying the core academic GCSEs that employers want.”","Inmates' English and maths scores ‘above national average' at one YOI .

"A bootmaking workshop that made quality footwear for some of the world's most famous people has been sold for a whopping $1.71 million, but the brothers who owned the iconic store had even greater stories to tell. Mosche 'Morris' and Adam Perkal kept some of the biggest names in showbiz well-heeled for over three decades. The likes of rock god Mick Jagger, actor William Holden, media tycoon Kerry Packer, crooner Frank Sinatra, Sammy Davis Jnr, the Bee Gees and even the Queen were all valued customers. The two nonagenarian brothers worked six days a week at their workshop in Surry Hills, Sydney. Last year the Polish-born siblings who survived the holocaust died within two weeks of each other – Morris, 94, suffered a heart attack on Christmas Eve, only 12 days after he buried his younger brother, who died aged 92 – and the property passed on to their extended family. The Rolling Stones' Mick Jagger was just one superstar that bought the Perkal brothers' shoes . Morris and Adam Perkal pose in their Perkal Bros Surgical & Bespoke Bootmakers store on August 12, 2011 . Morris Perkal works on a pair of shoes in the legendary shoe shop . Saturday’s auction of the landmark property at 386 Crown St attracted a crowd of onlookers and seven registered bidders who couldn't wait to get their hands on the dilapidated three-storey property. And if walls could talk what a story it could tell. The brothers worked side-by-side for more than six decades. Adam survived the Nazi's Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp as a teenager before emigrating to Australia. He was joined in 1947 by his older brother - who fled the family's native Poland to Russia during the war. In an interview with The Sydney Morning Herald in 2012, Morris said: 'In 1939, the Germans set fire to our synagogue and burnt our mother and little brother alive. We tried to escape to Russian-occupied Poland together. We arrived at the border in September and it was snowing and freezing. 'So we turned back. On the bridge in Warsaw, I told Adam I would try [to escape] again. He said he was going to stay with Dad and our sisters.' The Perkal brothers measured John Lennon and the rest of the Beatles for shoes in the band's hotel room in Kings Cross . The advertising that had been seen for years outside the Perkal Bros Surgical & Bespoke Bootmakers store . The next time Morris saw Adam was at Sydney airport in 1947, when he stepped off the plane after immigrating to Australia. 'I still cry when I remember how we met each other after years of being separated and not really knowing if each other was alive,' Morris said. As they grew old together memories of the past became even more important but some things were just too hard to talk about. 'He doesn't walk much any more. The [Mauthausen-Gusen] concentration camp affected him,' Morris told The Sydney Morning Herald about his brother Adam in 2012. 'It affected everybody, seeing people killed every minute. He's been changed physically and mentally. We don't talk about the concentration camp too much, because it would upset him. He was an innocent boy, just 18 years old.' Frank Sinatra was another high-profile customer of the Perkal brothers . Morris Perkal surveys the many shoes and boots in his workshop in 2011 . But happier times lay ahead and the brothers soon prospered in Australia. For decades they fashioned shoes and boots in a trade they believed was a dying art. They never had any disagreements and were at their happiest when working together making shoes. They made shoes for The Beatles and took their measurements in Kings Cross at their hotel when they came to Australia in the 1960s.Their best client was Australian media mogul Packer who for 35 years paid the brothers $1250-a-pair for polo boots until his death in 2005. At least they knew Packer was good for the cash, although the same could not be said about the Bee Gees as Morris explained to the Oral Histories website. 'When the Bee Gees came over they didn’t have the money to pay a deposit. And Mrs Kelly was there, Mrs. Kelly was there … agent. And Mrs. Kelly said, “I’m sorry, boys, you’ll have to wait for the deposit',' said Morris. A bit of repair work is carried out on a shoe by Morris Perkal in his workshop in 2011 . However, on Saturday instead of shoes it was the brothers' store that was for sale. Its history meant little to potential buyers who were more attracted by the mixed zoning and highly sought after location. A reserve of $1.6 million was set for the property. The Daily Telegraph reported that Adam Perkal’s daughter, Marilyn Hauptmann, said she felt emotional, but pleased when the building was finally sold. 'The price is what I expected, so I can’t ask for more than that,' she said. Ms Hauptmann congratulated the winning bidder, who wished to remain anonymous, and wished him all the best for the future. 'I'm so glad it’s going to a nice person who will take care of it,' she said.

"Scot Young pictured with his ex-fiancee Noelle Reno - who called off their longstanding engagement before his death . The final, desperate moments of the tycoon who plunged to his death on to spiked railings outside a £3 million apartment can be revealed today. Neighbours said there was a furious row between businessman Scot Young and his ex-fiancee Noelle Reno. She  made a frantic call to police – moments before he fell from a fourth-floor window. Noelle Reno had been angrily attempting to order him out of their shared apartment on Monday before he died. A source  said: ‘He just turned up unannounced inside the flat. She said, “What are you doing here? You’re not supposed to be here.” He was manic, crazy and probably high. It escalated. ‘Noelle removed herself from the situation by leaving the building and called the police on the way out. ‘She told them, “You might want to turn up, there’s a crazy man here. He’s gone mental. He won’t leave.” Noelle headed off to a girlfriend’s house. The police turned up at the apartment and then found him.’ Police say foul play was not involved and have given no credence to reports that Young’s death, on Monday, was connected with the Russian mafia. New details have emerged about the relationship between Ms Reno and Young in the days and weeks leading up to his death, and about the shady business deals he became embroiled in. We can reveal that: . Ms Reno, 33, had told friends that Young had been drinking heavily and using cocaine. The American-born model turned TV presenter had said before he died that he was ‘in a terrible state’ and had been threatening to harm himself if she refused to go back to him. Grim scene: Blood, broken railings and police tape where tycoon Scot Young died . Although they had split up, they had continued to share the apartment until a few days before the fatal incident, when Noelle had ordered him to live elsewhere. She had been making arrangements to change the locks. She had said that Young ‘was not in a good place’, had embarrassed her at a number of society events and had at times smelled of alcohol. Noelle, it is said, had been reluctant to publicise the news of their split because of his fragile mental state. Young had already attempted suicide, had been into rehab and been sectioned twice under the Mental Health Act. It is believed that he had arranged to be admitted to a mental health unit on the day he died. Property tycoon Young had already attracted considerable notoriety thanks to a bitter divorce dispute with his former wife Michelle, who in a series of high profile interviews and court hearings had accused him of hiding millions from her and their two daughters. The courts had found in Michelle’s favour, ordering Young to pay £20 million, and he spent time in jail for refusing to disclose details of his complicated finances. There was further controversy when it emerged that high-profile individuals, including Sir Philip Green the Top Shop owner, had loaned him considerable sums of money. However it seems that on a day-to-day basis Ms Reno was funding his activities – and that this had become a major bone of contention. One friend said Ms Reno had told her: ‘It’s not OK to have to pay for a 52-year-old.’ It is understood that Ms Reno spent time discussing the death with the police on Friday, and later met Mr Young’s daughters. An indication of Young’s state of mind before his death was given by his close friend Jim Creed, a 64-year-old businessman from Ealing, West London. Mr Creed said: ‘He kept phoning and phoning me on Monday. He was in a terrible state. He told me he had booked himself into a mental institution, that he was not well but that he would be out next Thursday. ‘He was very animated and emotional saying I was his best friend and how much he loved me. Scot was bi-polar and had been in and out of clinics, he wasn’t well. It was the stress of it all, he deteriorated in the past five years. Mr Creed added: ‘I didn’t think he was suicidal. He had hopes and plans for the future, he wanted to start a new life and was convinced he would make his money back.’ Noelle had said that Young ‘was not in a good place’, had embarrassed her at a number of society events and had at times smelled of alcohol . Young always described himself as a property developer who grew fabulously rich on the back of the building boom of the 1990s and 2000s. By 2006, he had accumulated a £60 million property portfolio, including a £21 million nine-bedroom mansion in Oxfordshire, a string of properties in London’s exclusive Eaton Square, and a £6 million mansion in Miami Beach. It is said Young and his associates owned a complete terrace of six stucco-fronted townhouses in Regent’s Park and a 118ft yacht registered in Palma, Majorca. In addition, he had an investment portfolio of stocks and shares which netted him around £2 million a year, and businesses which paid him a similar amount in commission. His total fortune was estimated at a conservative £400 million, and he liked to spend it. On Michelle’s 40th birthday, he presented her with £1 million of Graff jewellery. Other presents included a new Range Rover stuffed with couture clothing. But it has been claimed that his fortune was based on devising schemes to launder money belonging to the super rich through a web of offshore accounts. He used the money to finance huge deals, usually involving property, but sometimes buying and selling fine wines, works of art or vintage sports cars. The burgeoning assets market meant that the shrewdly-chosen deals almost always made money for his clients, while providing ways to make shady or undeclared money legitimate. Former business associates claim that inventive book-keeping could even provide tax shelters for his wealthy clientele. He and his partners would, say, pay £250,000 for a vintage Ferrari, but claim in accounts that it actually cost far more. Thus, when the car was later sold on, the declared profit would be tiny and the outlay, which could be claimed against tax, large. Young always described himself as a property developer who grew fabulously rich on the back of the building boom of the 1990s and 2000s . Young soon came to the notice of businessmen with huge sums of money to launder. One was the Russian oligarch Boris Berezovsky, who amassed an estimated £2 billion fortune amid the collapse of the Soviet Union and moved to London in 2000 after falling foul of President Putin. Young and his associates, it is claimed, would take 30 per cent commission on every pound they laundered. And as their personal wealth increased, they would increasingly take personal stakes in the quick-turnaround property deals they executed. At one stage in the last decade, Young was said to be the single most important client of the upmarket estate agency Knight Frank, which specialises in palatial properties. But as he grew wealthier, and his work on behalf of exiled Russian oligarchs increased, Young began to move in circles where even his famously deft mind could not help him. It is said that Berezovsky masterminded a secret property investment codenamed Project Moscow, which collapsed with enormous debts ten years ago. Young at one time owned 50 per cent of the venture, which was based on plans for a giant retail complex in the Russian capital. He later sold off five per cent shares to eager associates. No one knows whether the Russian government pulled the plug as part of a ‘sting operation’ against Berezovsky, but it is certain that Young and his accomplices were badly burned. Leading figures in the Russian mafia are also said to have lost heavily. Ms Reno, 33, had told her friends that Young had been drinking heavily and using cocaine . Several of Young’s closest associates are known to have invested and have since died, including Berezovsky, property tycoon Robert Curtis and Paul Castle, a polo friend of Prince Charles. A fifth member of the so-called ‘Ring of Death; around Young, Johnny Elichaoff, 55, the former husband of TV presenter Trinny Woodall, died in November after falling from a shopping centre in West London. A sixth, lawyer Stephen Curtis, who introduced Young to his Russian contacts, died in a mysterious helicopter crash in 2004, a week after telling friends he feared for his life. Young’s fortune was built on a reputation for trustworthiness and discretion. So when ex-wife Michelle engaged on a messy and high-profile divorce after he left her for another woman, it is understood his business associates became instantly alarmed. She hired lawyers and forensic accountants to unravel his secretive businesses. Police say foul play was not involved and have given no credence to reports that Young’s death, on Monday, was connected with the Russian mafia . In 2009 he was sentenced to six months in prison for refusing to reveal details of his wealth. After six years of litigation between the couple, described as ‘quite extraordinary’ by a judge, Young was ruled to be worth £40 million and ordered to pay his former wife half. He never paid a penny, while his daughters’ school fees and rent for Michelle’s home was paid by friends and a series of shadowy companies. While claiming penury, Young continued to lead an extravagant lifestyle – living in a luxury penthouse, driving a Ferrari – and then meeting glamorous Noelle. When challenged, he insisted he was living off the goodwill of friends. Michelle believed Young had hidden millions from her. After his death, she may find that if there is a fortune somewhere, it will be a whole lot harder to track down.

"Psychiatrist Dr Colin Brewer has detailed how he helped seven people die in the last two years . A British doctor told yesterday how he helped seven people to die at suicide clinics including Dignitas – only one of whom had a terminal illness. Over the past two years, psychiatrist Dr Colin Brewer has provided the medical reports which the seven needed to end their lives. His assessments, stating the patients were mentally alert enough to know what they were doing, were accepted by Swiss assisted dying clinics even though Dr Brewer was struck off the UK medical register eight years ago. The 73-year-old is the first doctor to speak so openly about how he helped people to die. His revelations, in a book he has co-edited, called I’ll See Myself Out, Thank you, will horrify opponents of assisted suicide. Supporters argue people with terminal illnesses should be allowed to opt to die before disease ravages their body or mind. But if Dr Brewer’s account is typical, it suggests only a small proportion of those choosing to end their lives this way are terminally ill. Among the seven people were Marjorie, a former businesswoman in her nineties, who lived in severe pain that could not be diagnosed or treated. A man in his sixties called Eddie, a retired professional, was going blind and wanted to die before he lost his sight. Then there was Henry, in his eighties and with early Alzheimer’s, and Charlotte, a WI chairman with Alzheimer’s, who wanted to die before she had to leave her home. Speaking about Jacques, a retired academic in his seventies who suffered arthritis, heart disease and high blood pressure, Dr Brewer said: ‘It sounds no worse than in most people of his age. But he dreaded the possibility of a sudden deterioration … that would deprive him of the mental capacity to decide on the manner of his death.’ The only one of the seven with a terminal illness was Nick, who had motor neurone disease and was told he had less than a year to live. An exterior view of the Swiss assisted dying clinic, Dignits, where Mr Brewer provided medical reports to . In the book Dr Brewer writes: ‘In the last year or two, I have carried out psychiatric assessments for a few people who were planning to go to Switzerland for medically assisted rational suicide. ‘Nearly all these people had led lives that marked them out as exemplary and high-achieving … They wanted deaths that matched their lives, with a minimum of pain … but also well-organised, civilised, considerate of others, not too long and, above all, dignified.’ In about three other cases, Dr Brewer raised doubts about whether a patient was mentally fit to make the decision, he told The Sunday Times. In 2006, he was struck off by the General Medical Council for inappropriate drug prescribing, including heroin substitutes to his addiction patients. He is not allowed to practise as a doctor in the UK. Alison Saunders, director of public prosecutions, recently said she was less likely to prosecute doctors assisting in the death of patients not under their direct care. Critics say Mr Brewer has exploited this. A spokesman for campaign Care Not Killing said the main doctors’ groups ‘vigorously oppose’ changing assisted dying laws. He said the Royal College of Psychiatrists argues suicidal people need support and ‘not the keys to the drugs cabinet’.","Dr Colin Brewer was struck off for inappropriate drug prescribing in 2006 .

Sir Edwin Lutyens, who is often referred to as Britain's greatest ever architect, who remodelled Warren Mere in 1897. He is best known for designing the Cenotaph in central London . Sir Edwin Landseer Lutyens has been referred to as 'the greatest British architect'. He designed the Grade I listed Cenotaph that stands in Whitehall, London. It was erected in 1919 for the Allied Victory Parade and was intended to commemorate the victims of the First World War. But it is now used to remember all of the dead in all wars in which British servicemen and women have fought. He is known for having an instrumental role in designing and building a section of the metropolis of Delhi, known as New Delhi. In collaboration with Sir Herbert Baker, he was also the main architect of several monuments including the India Gate in Delhi. He also designed Viceroy's House, which is now known as the Rashtrapati Bhavan. It is regarded as his most important building and combined aspects of classical architecture with Indian decoration. In 1924 he completed the supervision of the construction of what is perhaps his most popular design: Queen Mary's Dolls' House. This four-storey Palladian villa was built in 1/12 scale and is now a permanent exhibit in the public area of Windsor Castle. He married Emily Lytton, daughter of a Viceroy of India, in 1897. After World War I Lutyens became architect to the Imperial War Graves Commission, for which he designed the Cenotaph, the Great War Stone and military cemeteries in France. His vast project for the Roman Catholic cathedral at Liverpool was incomplete at his death. He also designed the Thiepval Memorial to the Missing of the Somme, which remembers 72,195 British and South African men who died in the Battles of the Somme. It is the largest British battle memorial in the world and was built between 1928 and 1932.","Warren Mere, a 16th century mansion in Surrey, remodelled by architect Sir Edwin Lutyens in 1897 is up for sale .

"A friend of classroom murderer Will Cornick has revealed how he is ‘haunted with guilt’ for failing to speak up about the teenager’s threats to kill his teacher. Cornick attacked Spanish teacher Ann Maguire after boasting to classmates at Corpus Christi College in Leeds that he wanted to kill her. Now one of his friends has told how he is riddled with guilt for failing to inform school bosses about the threats. Scroll down for video . A friend of classroom murderer Will Cornick (left) has revealed how he is ‘haunted with guilt’ for failing to speak up about the teenager’s threats to kill his teacher, Ann Maguire (right) The 16-year-old said he did not tell teachers because he did not believe Cornick would act on what he had said. He told the Daily Mirror: 'I don’t think about it as much as I did. I try not to. But I do still feel guilty because If I’d told someone, she would be alive today. I could have stopped it. ‘I didn’t tell the teachers because I really never thought he would do anything. ‘I thought he was just trying to scare us. I thought it was bravado - just a sick, terrible joke. I just thought it was a teenage thing.’ Cornick, 16, knifed Mrs Maguire to death at the school in April this year. He also said he was going to murder other teachers, including a pregnant woman ‘so as to kill her unborn child’. The killing, at Corpus Christi Catholic College in Leeds, shocked Britain and is believed to be the first time a teacher has been killed by a student in the classroom in the UK . He later told doctors: ‘I said I was going to do other stuff but I never got the chance, other murders. It was a triple homicide.’ After the murder the teenager told psychiatrists that he ‘couldn't give a s***’ and added: ‘Everything I've done is fine and dandy.’ Cornick was sentenced to life in jail earlier this month and a judge warned him he may never be released. Judge Mr Justice Coulson called the murder a 'monumental act of cowardice and evil' and branded the teenager's pride and lack of remorse over his actions 'truly grotesque'. Cornick was initially taken to Wetherby Young Offender Institution (YOI) in West Yorkshire before being moved for his own safety.","Friend of Will Cornick reveals guilt at not alerting school to killer's threats .

"The Taxpayer's Alliance called the spending 'wasteful' and blasted what it called the BBC's 'lucrative revolving door'. File image used . The BBC has come under fire for re-hiring 700 people  who it had previously spent £10.3million on making redundant. It has emerged that of the 700 staff members who took redundancy packages, more than 400 are now back at the broadcaster working as freelancers. Last night the Taxpayers' Alliance criticised what it described as the BBC's 'lucrative revolving door'. John O'Connell, the director of the Taxpayers' Alliance, said: 'Licence-fee payers will be furious that their cash is being wasted on generous golden goodbyes, only for those made ""redundant"" to walk back in on a new salary,' the Sun on Sunday reported. A BBC spokesperson told the paper it was common to have seasonal freelancers in the journalism industry as it helped keep costs down. News of the spending comes amid a row over the corporation's plans to broadcast a story imagining the assassination of Margaret Thatcher. The fantasy, written by bestselling author Hilary Mantel, was condemned as ‘perverted’ and ‘distasteful’ when it was published in September. Despite this, Radio 4 has selected the story for its prestigious Book At Bedtime slot – sparking a furious backlash. Supporters of the former Prime Minister accused the broadcaster of being deliberately provocative with a move that will stoke accusations of BBC bias against the Tories. ‘It is a sick book from a sick mind and it’s being promoted by a sick broadcasting corporation,’ former Cabinet Minister Lord Tebbit said. Lord Tebbit's wife Margaret was paralysed when the IRA tried to murder Margaret Thatcher and her Cabinet in the 1984 Brighton bombing. Ms Mantel’s story depicts the callous murder of the former Prime Minister by an IRA gunman and was inspired by the Booker Prize-winning author’s own fantasy about assassinating Lady Thatcher, who she admits to ‘detesting’. The broadcast on January 9 will increase tensions between the BBC and the Government after David Cameron and George Osborne accused the Corporation of bias in its coverage of spending cuts.","The BBC has re-hired hundreds it spent £10.3million on making redundant .

"It’s every person’s dream to buy their dream home but it seems Australians have become more obsessed with improving what they already have. With property prices booming across the country more and more home-owners are choosing to spend their money making what they've got as impressive as possible. An ideal home for Australians consists of a swimming pool, walk-in wardrobes, home theatre and integrated sound system, designer kitchen and even a fireplace.

But a small percentage of Australians actually can’t put a label on taste with nearly one in 10 struggling to define their home style. Overall, Sydneysiders are most inspired by global styles, Perthians love country, Adelaidians liked traditional, retro and electric and as expected, Brisbanites lead the nation in tropical style.

Adding Value – To add value to your home, home-owners are increasingly desiring luxury ‘hotel’ like bathrooms and ensuites that accommodate double shower cubicles, twin basins, the use of natural stone tiles and make-up areas. Following popular reality TV cooking shows, home-owners are now looking for the latest kitchen gadgets, cooking preparation areas and professional set ups. Whatever your space and budget, a bathroom and kitchen with a designer feel can add value to your property. Trends – A current trend in Australia is creating an outdoor undercover alfresco area connected to your living space that houses a BBQ, sink, wood fire pizza oven, built in outdoor cupboards and overhead heating that suits the Australian outdoor way of living. Even if you create this using a simple marquee, nice potted plants and textured outdoor pillows on seats, this will create the outdoor room effect that people love. Decorating - The most basic and cost effective way to add value to your home is to re-paint, re-carpet and where possible re-tile areas that look dated. Even changing small details like door handles and hinges can completely freshen the look of your home. Professionals Help – If calling in professionals like architects and interiors designers, be clear on your brief. What is it that you want from the renovation? The designer must convey to you whether your brief can be fulfilled with your budgetary requirements. There is no use starting the design process if you don’t have enough funds to fulfil your brief, so be honest about your budget. Small spaces - The best way to make the most of small space properties is to create built in joinery and storage, eliminating clutter and the need to purchase multiple furnishings. So for example making a stylish mezzanine / foldaway area for your bed and a pull out desk for office space.

"British aid has assisted the brutal execution of nearly 3,000 people accused of drug smuggling in Iran, according to a report to be released this week. The campaign group Reprieve says millions of pounds from British taxpayers can be linked to ‘control’ operations and hangings carried out by the hard-line Islamic regime. Those killed – often in public, suspended from cranes after forced confessions, torture and secret trials – include women, children and political dissidents. Human rights groups say the deaths are designed to spread fear rather than curb the drug trade. Scroll down for video . Executed: Zahra Bahrami, a British resident with dual Dutch-Iranian nationality, was hanged on alleged drug smuggling charges after joining in with anti-regime protests in 2009. Her daughter, also pictured, was not harmed . Reprieve’s research reveals Britain channelled more money to Iran than the rest of Europe combined, in an effort to fight the drugs trade. Yet Iran has the world’s highest per capita execution rate, despite the UK’s public stance of seeking the death penalty’s abolition around the globe. Britain’s support was quietly stopped amid outrage that it was boosting Iran’s security machine, but Reprieve believes scores more people sentenced to death still face execution thanks to British aid already received. And it points out that millions still flow to similar operations in neighbouring Pakistan, which has the world’s largest death row population. Several Britons, including one mother and a man with learning difficulties, face execution for alleged drug crimes. ‘You look at those on death row in these two places and they are never the cartel kingpins but the poorest and most vulnerable, including children and people who are mentally ill or have learning difficulties,’ said Maya Foa, Reprieve’s lead investigator. ‘It is utterly hypocritical of Britain to call for worldwide abolition of the death penalty and then support policies in breach of its own human rights rules that encourage the round-up and execution of scapegoats and mules.’ Such policies fly in the face of the Coalition’s defence of its controversial £11 billion aid handouts on the grounds of a ‘moral obligation’ to help the world’s poorest people. Brutal: A woman is hanged from a crane in Iran for alleged drug offences . Reprieve’s report – European Aid For Executions – reveals Britain gave nearly £6 million to 12 Iranian anti-drug projects between 1998 and 2012. During this period there were 2,917 confirmed executions of alleged offenders. They included a 15-year-old boy and a Dutch woman who joined anti-government protests. The cash provided Iran’s feared security forces with border posts, 1,000 bullet-proof vests, night-vision devices, body scanners, satellite phones, computer software, sniffer dogs and specialised surveillance vehicles. It was channelled through the United Nations Office On Drugs And Crime, whose director has praised Iran’s ‘good practices’ and ‘active role’ in fighting drugs. One flagship project co-funded by Britain was the creation of ‘border liaison offices’ beside Afghanistan. Among those subsequently caught was 15-year-old Naeem Kolbali, hanged for alleged drug trafficking although executions of juveniles breach international law. Sixteen more children were put to death in another Iranian border project. War orphans are often forced to carry drugs such as heroin and crystal meth between the two countries. Reports suggest some are sentenced to death without appearing in court. Jannat Mir, a 15-year-old Afghan schoolboy hanged in April, was denied access to lawyers. The number of executions has been rising in Iran, with 647 known to have taken place this year – the majority for drug offences. Human rights group Amnesty has accused the country of carrying out a ‘killing spree of staggering proportions’ under cover of the war on drugs. Many hangings are carried out in public, although one notorious prison has a beam that can hold 60 nooses and once recorded 89 deaths in a single day. Those facing accusations have complained of beatings, torture and mock executions to force confessions. Iran has a massive drugs problem, with more than one million addicts amid soaring opium production in neighbouring Afghanistan. But Reprieve says donors setting targets for aid encourage an increase in often-dubious convictions and subsequent death sentences. Cases such as that of Zahra Bahrami, a British resident with dual Dutch-Iranian nationality, also fuel fears the regime uses the drugs war to clamp down on political dissent. Ms Bahrami joined in with hundreds of thousands of supporters of the opposition leader Mir-Hossein Moussavi who marched through the streets of the capital Tehran during a protest against  alleged fraud in the recent presidential election in June 2009 . In December that year, supports of Iran's regime took to the streets of Tehran in a show of force against the opposition which it accused of being 'pawns of the enemies' Bahrami returned to Iran for her daughter’s cancer treatment and was then arrested after joining anti-government protests. She was tortured, held in solitary confinement, charged with smuggling and forced to make a televised confession before execution in January 2011. ‘If they execute people for drugs there is no international outcry,’ said Mahmood Amiry-Moghaddam, a professor of medicine and leading Iranian human rights activist. ‘They are victims of an execution machine that is meant to spread fear. The number of executions goes up when the authorities face protests or civil society becomes too bold, then goes down during elections and when the international community has its eyes on Iran.’ Britain finally cut off its aid three years ago following concerns in some other European countries over Iran’s increasing use of death sentences. ‘The donations are leading to executions,’ said one Danish minister after his country evaluated the projects. But Reprieve accuses the Coalition of pouring money into similar programmes in Pakistan, which has more than 8,000 people on death row. Britain is one of the biggest aid donors to Pakistan despite concerns over corruption. Almost £13 million has been handed to 22 counter-narcotic projects – again, far more than given by other European nations. A Pakistan minister disclosed earlier this year that 100 prisoners had been given death sentences for drug offences since 1997, including five British men and one woman. Another 444 cases punishable by death were outstanding. Those on death row include Arshad Ahmed, 52, a father of five from Birmingham who has learning difficulties. He was arrested in 2003 for possession of heroin worth £4 million after he carried locked luggage on to a flight to Britain. Lawyers say his disability was ignored while there was no investigation into the men who gave him the bags. The same gang is thought to be behind the smuggling of 140lb of heroin by Birmingham mother-of-three Khadija Shah. She was given a life sentence in March. Although there have been no hangings in Pakistan for six years, they are expected to resume next year. ‘The government has in principle decided to lift the moratorium,’ said one official in Islamabad. A Foreign Office spokesman said the UK worked closely with partners to tackle drug trafficking and production: ‘We have a robust mechanism for identifying and managing the potential risks of our actions in relation to supply.’ He added that Britain was implacably opposed to the death penalty ‘in all circumstances’ and was concerned by suggestions that executions might resume in Pakistan.","Millions from Britain linked to 'control' operations and hangings by  regime .

"Tens of thousands of air travellers left stranded by a major computer glitch this weekend are set to be denied compensation because of an EU loophole, this newspaper has been told. Airlines are claiming that an ‘unprecedented’ IT failure at the UK’s national air traffic control centre – which threw the travel plans of 120,000 people into chaos – was ‘beyond their control’. This will enable them to sidestep regulations which say passengers are entitled to up to £470 for cancelled and severely delayed flights. A spokesman for the airline easyJet said last night that passengers were entitled to refunds or free rebooking of flights, but added: ‘As this is an exceptional circumstance, compensation does not apply.’ And a British Airways spokeswoman said: ‘Yesterday’s events were outside of British Airways’ control.’ Scroll down for video . Passengers left stranded by a major computer glitch this weekend (pictured) are to be denied compensation . Louise Ellman, who chairs the Commons Transport Select Committee, has launched an investigation and told The Mail on Sunday: ‘These passengers have been severely inconvenienced through no fault of their own and should have the right to be recompensed. ‘We will be investigating two things: firstly what went wrong, how it happened and how it can be stopped; and secondly, how passengers were treated – whether they were given enough information and looked after properly. This includes compensation.’ Friday’s chaos continued to have a knock-on effect yesterday with 54 flights cancelled at Heathrow and Gatwick. Following an urgent investigation at its £700million headquarters yesterday, a spokesman for Nats – the company in charge of UK air traffic control – revealed that the problem had been caused when part of a computer system holding flight path data became overloaded. This led it to shut down unexpectedly at 3.27pm on Friday. While air traffic controllers at the base in Swanwick, Hampshire, could still communicate with pilots and track planes in the sky, they could no longer see what altitude or route each aircraft was scheduled to take – forcing airspace over London to be shut down for 40 minutes. ‘It has never happened before – it’s something completely new,’ the spokesman said last night as engineers continued to investigate the problem. Airlines are claiming the unprecedented IT failure was beyond their control - which enables them to dodge compensation claims. Pictured are passengers stranded at Heathrow . The delays, caused by an IT glitch, threw the travel plans of 120,000 people into chaos . Consumer expert Guy Anker, from the website moneysavingexpert.com, said: ‘The airline can get out of paying compensation if it’s the case that cancellations and delays were caused by “extraordinary circumstances”. ‘EU rules around compensation only apply to the airlines so if it’s a problem that is beyond their control then consumers won’t get any money beyond hotel and food expenses.’ Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin, who described the disruption as ‘unacceptable’, will be questioned on the issue when he appears before the Transport Select Committee tomorrow. This weekend’s problems came a year after a telephone failure at Nats’ control room also caused huge disruption – one of a number of technical hitches to hit the part-privatised operation since its Swanwick centre opened in 2002.","Thousands to be denied compensation for travel chaos at the weekend .

"One man claims that the legend of Bigfoot is 100 per cent real - and has released a photograph of a hairy humanoid body that he says proves the mythical creature's existence. Of course, the man is also known to enjoy the occasional hoax. Rick Dyer says he shot Bigfoot near San Antonio, Texas, on September 6, 2012. He also claims to have conducted 'scientific DNA tests' on the body and, after showing it off to more than 100 witnesses, now plans to take it on a tour around America. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Body of the beast: Rick Dyer claims that this is a photo of legendary creature Bigfoot, which he shot near San Antonio and now plans to take on tour . KSAT.com reports that this is the first time Mr Dyer has released a photo since he shared a grainy video of the beast lurking outside his tent. Mr Dyer claims that he lured the beast by nailing pork ribs he had bought from Walmart to a tree. He told KSAT: 'I nailed... pork ribs from the Walmart down the street to the side of the tree, and lo and behold, he came and started eating the pork ribs off the tree.' The Huffington Post reports that Mr Dyer filmed the creature as he was enjoying his last meal. Obviously believing that the video evidence was not enough, Mr Dyer allegedly shot the creature. On the Bigfoot trail: Rick Dyer says he managed to lure the beast in by nailing some pork ribs that he bought at Walmart to a tree. While the creature was eating, Mr Dyer allegedly shot it . The excitement surrounding Mr Dyer's claims is tempered somewhat by the fact that he was involved in a Bigfoot hoax back in 2008. Back then, as now, he claimed he had the body of Bigfoot. But The National Geographic reported that, once the frozen body began to thaw, the body turned out to be nothing more than a rubber ape suit. This time Mr Dyer is adamant that his Bigfoot is 'for real'. He said: 'From DNA tests to 3D optical scans to body scans. It is the real deal. It's Bigfoot and Bigfoot's here, and I shot it and now I'm proving it to the world.' Mr Dyer has yet to produce the results of the DNA tests and optical scans, but he says he will be holding a press conference soon to answer any questions. Bigfoot sightings have been reported in forested areas all over the world, but physical evidence - such as a partial or complete body of the creature - has so far proven elusive. Video by Rick Dyer .

"He is arguably the most famous astronaut since Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin after performing David Bowie’s Space Oddity on his guitar while he was more than 200 miles above the Earth. To date, Commander Chris Hadfield’s video – shot in the International Space Station (ISS) – has had 25 million viewings on YouTube and even has the backing of the rock star himself, who declared it the most ‘poignant’ version of his hit. But as if that wasn’t enough, the ISS commander’s fan base has gone stratospheric after he used his free time on board the floating laboratory to snap a series of stunning photographs of planet Earth and upload them to the world via a NASA link after taking personal requests from people around the globe. Scroll down for video . Zero gravity: Chris Hadfield performs while in orbit aboard the International Space Station in hit video . The outcome was 45,000 captivating images – a number of Scotland, where his family are originally from – and a selection of which now feature in new book You Are Here: Around the World in 92 Minutes, the title taken from the length of time it takes for the ISS to make one orbit of the Earth. Tomorrow, the 55-year-old Canadian astronaut, who retired last year, will touch down briefly in Edinburgh and Glasgow as part of a tour of book signings and entertaining presentations about his photographs and life among the stars. He laughs as he admits he is as thrilled to be returning to Scotland as he was on his repeat visits to space. Seriously? ‘I love Scotland,’ he says, emphatically. ‘My grandmother’s family are from the Borders and I’ve been to Scotland many times over the years. In the 1820s, her family sent the eldest son to Canada, sort of like a space probe being launched today, to see how it was. He ended up in Montreal and never looked back. The rest, as they say, is history.’ On a mission: Chris Hadfield's performance of David Bowie’s Space Oddity has had 25 million viewings on YouTube . He added: ‘It’s kind of funny that I ended up doing the same sort of thing, but to space, all these years later.’ His crystal-clear images of Skye, the Trossachs and the Clyde and Forth estuaries thrilled thousands in the UK when they were broadcast last year. Former First Minister Alex Salmond was so taken with the photographs that he tweeted the astronaut his praise as well as inviting him to visit. From the ISS, Commander Hadfield, who now has 1.2 million followers on Twitter, replied: ‘I’d love to visit Scotland again once back on Earth. I’ve been from Oban to Aberdeen, but there’s so much more to see and do.’ On his way back from his last space mission in May last year, when his plane stopped off briefly in Scotland en route to the US, he tweeted again: ‘On the ground in Prestwick, to refuel. Blue sky day. Nature smiling on us. Was 1st here in 1977 – who could have predicted this?’ The astronaut representing the Canadian Space Agency stands on a Canadian-built robot arm in 2001 . The astronaut believes his images have been such a phenomenal success because they strike a chord in the heart of everyone. He said: ‘Everyone’s curious about how their part of the world looks from space and how it fits into everywhere else. It’s such an unusual and unique perspective to see the world that way. ‘So, while I was in orbit, I was emailing my son and it was his idea that I should take photographs of Earth. He suggested asking everyone down below for their ideas. 'It had an immediate impact, with requests coming in from people asking me to take their part of the world. It wasn’t just some sort of narcissism. People genuinely wanted to see how it all looked.’ He added: ‘It was terrific fun but it took a bit of planning. I would wake up every morning in the space station, launch the laptop in my sleep pod and log on to Earth Map. 'I’d scan through to see where we were going to be getting close to, then I’d check out the weather to see if it was cloudy or stormy and when that country was going to be in daylight. Chris Hadfield wowed hisTwitter followers with this photograph of the Isle of Skye shot out of the window of his capsule in space . ‘If I thought it was going to work, I’d set the alarm to give myself a ten-minute warning. Sometimes, still wiping the sleep from my eyes or, if I was working on an experiment, suddenly my alarm would go off and I’d float over using the handrail, grab the camera and get the best position at the window after checking out the sun and the angle. The ISS has a three dimensional bay window with enormous panes. They can get a bit smeared from people floating into them or looking out all the time. But I’d look for an unblemished spot on the glass and start taking pictures. Once I was finished, I put the memory card in my pocket, continued working and uploaded the images to a NASA link overnight. ‘I never actually saw many of the images I took, so that’s the reason for the book.’ Divided up by continent, the selected images in the book represent one orbit of the ISS and his planetary photo tour is punctuated with fun and fascinating commentary on life in zero gravity. A presentation by him tomorrow at the Glasgow Science Centre is a sell-out, with all profits from the book going to the Red Cross. Another image taken from 250 miles above the Earth's surface offers a unique view of Scotland#s mainland . His favourite moments in orbit, not surprisingly, came during space walks, where the jaw-dropping beauty of the galaxy made it difficult to concentrate on the sometimes menial tasks in hand. He said: ‘I’ve spent 15 hours outside, with nothing between me and space except a spacesuit. There is nothing like that feeling of travelling through the universe with the Earth in the distance. ‘As humans, we get used to being on our planet, looking up to the universe. But actually being in the universe, looking down on the planet, is awe-inspiring. ‘There’s a visual allure in space that can make it hard to keep your mind on the job in hand because there are so many amazing things to see. The endless depths of space fill your thoughts and every time you are carrying out a task, you find yourself checking on the view.’ His vivid description conjures up images of the blockbuster Gravity, starring Sandra Bullock and George Clooney as astronauts caught up in a catastrophic set of events in space. ‘Has he seen it?’ I ask. Chris Hadfield was the first Canadian to walk in space. He recently returned from a five month-stint in on the International Space Station where he served as commander . The man who was the top graduate of the US Air Force Test Pilot School in 1988 and the US Navy test pilot of the year in 1991 before being hand-picked a year later by the Canadian Space Agency to be an astronaut laughs as he says: ‘Yes, I think I was the first astronaut to see Gravity. Of course, the storyline is pure Hollywood and you have to suspend your disbelief. 'But visually it’s great. I think it captures that fundamental sense of the enormity, of space being around you and the Earth somewhere nearby.’ His music video, a zero-gravity version of Bowie’s song, received more than ten million views in its first three days online and had a profound effect on many who saw it – including its creator. The astronaut said: ‘Bowie said it was the most poignant cover of his song. Why? I think it’s because it crosses over from fantasy to reality. For years, the whole “Ground control to Major Tom” thing was an idea. Then a spaceman made it actually happen.’ Former First Minister Alex Salmond was so taken with the photographs that he tweeted the astronaut his praise as well as inviting him to visit . He added: ‘Maybe it’s my Scottish ancestry but I’ve always been musical on a local pub level and I’ve got one of those brains that remembers all the lines. But I’d never covered Bowie before. MY brother and I had recorded a Christmas carol which I performed from the ISS. My son Evan encouraged me to try Space Oddity and to begin with I only did it to humour him. ‘I’d no idea it would take off the way it did. I recorded vocals and guitar. Back on Earth, Evan organised the piano accompaniment and other instruments. It’s now been watched more than 25 million times, which is frankly incredible.’ He has no regrets about never returning to space now that he’s retired. ‘I’ve led a varied life and I don’t sit around thinking about it. I’m moving on to the next phase. ‘I might go back to school and learn about palaeontology or the human genome. Or trying to address the problems of climate change.’ It’s clear that the astronaut will never leave the man. For someone for whom the sky has never been a limit, he is still aiming high.","Canadian astronaut Chris Hadfield filmed himself singing in space station .

"Peter Quinn was jailed for ten years after he attempted to rape two teenage girls in a graveyard . A sex-attacker who told his two teenage victims that he gets turned on when a woman tells him she doesn't want it has been jailed for ten years. Peter Quinn, 23, pounced on his victims and dragged them into a graveyard on their way home from a Halloween party. The attacker from Swindon, Wiltshire told one of the girls to perform a sex act on him or he would rape her friend. Luckily, one of the girls was able to break free and ran away screaming 'rape' before dialing 999. Both of the 19-year-old girls were wearing fancy dress when they were attacked. A passer-by saw Quinn and chased him off following the 4am attack. The girls were interviewed by police how gave them an e-fit description. Quinn was arrested as a result of the tattack. Quinn initially denied the horrific attack, but forensic evidence - a pubic hair recovered from one of the victim's breasts - came back as a match and he pleaded guilty at Swindon Crown Court. The court heard the attack, on November 1, 2014, in Swindon Town Centre left the girls severely traumatised, with one suffering reoccurring nightmares. Hannah Squire, prosecuting, said: 'This was a terrifying attack on two young women late at night. It was prolonged and would have left them traumatised.' The court heard Quinn ran up behind the girls shouting 'Wey hay', but they thought nothing of it and dismissed him as another Hallowe'en reveller. But he grabbed both girls and dragged them into the graveyard where he exposed himself and pushed private parts into one of the victim's face while fondling breasts of the other. Quinn demanded each carry out sex acts on him telling them he would rape her friend if they refused saying 'When a woman doesn't want it, it turns me on'. One of the girls managed to dial 999 saying 'Hello, police. Faringdon Park,' before Quinn knocked the handset from her grasp, before he fled the scene. Quinn, of Swindon, Wiltshire, pleaded guilty to two counts of attempted rape and one of sexual assault. Judge Tim Mousley QC in sentencing said: 'What you did to them was the sort of offence that, mercifully, rarely comes before the courts. Sentencing Quinn at Swindon Crown Court, pictured, Judge Tim Mousley said the women had been subjected to a 'living nightmare' and praised them claiming they showed 'enormous courage in resiisting him. 'You created a living nightmare for these two young women which they still experience in nearly every aspect of their young lives and will continue to do so for perhaps the rest of their lives. 'One can only hope that the impact upon them will decrease over the years. These were sustained assaults on two young vulnerable women, significantly younger than yourself. 'I am satisfied that you were determined to force yourself fully on either or both of them in that church yard that night and what you did was accompanied by your making the most frightening threats to them. 'They showed enormous courage in resisting you. It was only as a result of that that you were prevented from reaching your wicked aims.' He sentenced Quinn to ten years in prison with a five year extended licence meaning he must register as a sex offender for life.","Peter Quinn from Swindon was jailed for ten years for attempted rape .

"When Ros Green first saw The Chapel at Rendham, near Aldeburgh, in Suffolk, she decided to buy it on the spot. ‘Admittedly I was pregnant and jet-lagged,’ says Ros, ‘but I thought it was wonderful. I loved the pillars inside and managed to ignore all the problems.’ Ros, who had been brought up in Suffolk, had just flown in from Australia, where she had been raising her first two children with her partner, Douglas Hunter. By the time Douglas arrived from Australia the deal was done. He turned up to find he was the owner of an enormous dilapidated building with holes in the roof, broken windows and a sea of pews. He said only one word. ‘Why?’ The Chapel at Rendham, near Aldeburgh, in Suffolk, a five-bedroom converted home - still with altar platform and pulpit - is on the market for £695,000 . But there was another shock in store for Douglas – one that he could never have predicted. While his mother, over on a visit from the other side of the world, was looking through some old documents at the chapel, she made an amazing discovery: she found that it had been built with money from one of their ancestors. ‘I’m actually a fifth generation New Zealander,’ says Douglas. ‘I didn’t know of any family connection with Suffolk so it was a spooky surprise when we discovered it.’ The ancestor in question was Dr Isaac Watts, a prolific hymn-writer, whose most well-known works include Joy To The World and Our God, Our Help In Ages Past. The chapel had been built in 1750 with the help of a generous donation from Dr Watts. Watts was a nonconformist and the chapel, before it was deconsecrated in 1979 because of dwindling congregations, was a United Reformed church. John Wesley, the founder of Methodism, is said to have often visited it in the 18th Century. When Douglas and Ros bought it 23 years ago, the chapel had been empty for more than a decade. ‘We never planned to buy a wreck or a chapel,’ says Ros. ‘But my mother was keen for us to come to Suffolk and knew we wouldn’t be seduced by an ordinary house, so when she spotted this chapel for sale she sent us the details.’ After purchasing the building 23 years ago, current owner Douglas Hunter (pictured with partner Ros Green) found that The Chapel had been built with money from one of his ancestors, Dr Isaac Watts . The scale of the work required was overwhelming and they had to do a lot before they could move in. Luckily, Ros’s parents live nearby and they stayed with them for six months. The chapel had to be re-roofed and the whole building re-plumbed. Once the basics were done, they moved in and did everything else, including finding furniture at auctions, bit by bit. The chapel is now a wonderfully spacious family home, with a vast main living space with 20ft high ceilings and a wide gallery on three sides. The big kitchen, which was once the school room, has doors out on to the large garden (the headstones have been moved to a garden of remembrance opposite). The ground-floor bathroom, once the vestry, has a beautiful roll-top bath and the antique lamp fixed to the wall was given to Ros and Douglas by someone who knew it had originally come from the chapel. Dr Isaac Watts composed many popular hymns, including Joy To The World . At the other end of the chapel from the kitchen, a wall has been put in to slice off space for Ros and Douglas’s bedroom and en suite shower. Two other bedrooms are on the ground floor, and upstairs, in the corners of the gallery, are two more rooms, one of which is used as a bedroom and the other a study. Interestingly, from the outside the chapel looks like a handsome red-brick house – its history is revealed only when you step inside. Douglas and Ros both work in the arts, as events producers and consultants, and their two daughters are both artists. So it’s not surprising that the walls are covered in art and the house is full of quirky pieces picked up here and there. But what makes the chapel extra special is that, unlike most conversions, the altar platform and rail and pulpit are still in situ. The platform is the perfect spot for the baby grand piano, where eldest daughter Lily plays and composes. A link, perhaps, to her hymn-writing ancestor. The whole family agree that the chapel has given them a very happy home for the past 23 years. But now that the three children – Felix, 25, Lily, 24, and Angelica, 22 – have flown the coop, the couple have put it on the market at £695,000. ‘It’s wasted without a family,’ says Ros. ‘The children had a fantastic time growing up here: there was so much space for them to run around and all their friends would come here. It was always full of children.’ They used to hold Nativity plays on Christmas Eve for the whole village, and always have an enormous 20ft Christmas tree. ‘I did feet slightly guilty converting a chapel into somewhere to live,’ says Ros, ‘so it was nice to keep those traditions. People in the village have a connection to this place – we used to have people coming here looking for their family pews.’ Where will they go when the chapel is sold? ‘We want something that’s ours and unique,’ says Ros. ‘What we plan to do is buy a plot of land and build a sustainable straw bale house. We couldn’t live somewhere ordinary now.’ Bedfords, 01728 454505, bedfords.co.uk .","The Chapel at Rendham, Suffolk, built in 1750, on sale for £695,000 .

"A pregnant mum says she was ordered to surrender two jars of Nutella at London City Airport because staff claimed the chocolate spread posed a terror risk. Kara Harrison became upset when staff at a security checkpoint ordered her to hand over the jars which she was carrying in her hand luggage at the airport in east London. The 35-year-old says a worker told her the chocolate spread breached liquid restrictions and could not be carried onto the plane. Scroll down for video . Kara Harrison holds a customised Nutella jar, with a co-worker's name on the label, at Selfridges . According to the official guidance, gels, liquids and pastes must be in containers of 100ml or less. These can include: . Kara, a home economics teacher, said: ‘They told me the chocolate was dangerous and had to be confiscated. I was distraught.’ She and her husband, Iain, were flying home to Scotland after a short break in London, where they spent the weekend sightseeing, shopping and attending a concert. Among the highlights was a visit to Selfridges department store in Oxford Street, where shoppers can buy special jars of Nutella with their names on the label. They're so popular queues often bring the shop to a standstill. Kara, from South Queensferry near Edinburgh, bought one jar for her three-year-old son, Ewan, and another for work colleague Elaine. She was so pleased with her festive purchases she even posed for a picture in front of the Nutella display in the store. But festive spirit was sadly lacking when the couple got to London City Airport for their flight home. Kara said: ‘We'd packed everything into our hand luggage so that we would be quick getting on the flight, but as we watched the bags go through the scanner, we realised something was wrong.’ Staff called Kara to one side and asked her to open her bag. Pointing to the two jars, they asked what they were. A spokesman for London City Airport said it adheres to rules set out by the Department for Transport . ‘I explained that they were Nutella spread and that they were Christmas presents. But they said that as they were a liquid they'd have to be confiscated. ‘It seemed completely daft. It was obvious what they were and that they didn't pose a security threat.’ As they waited in the departure lounge, Kara's anger turned to tears, and she had to be consoled by Iain. She said: ‘I know it seems daft, but I'm feeling a wee bit sensitive at the moment because I'm pregnant, and it is nearly Christmas.’ Current rules require all liquids, pastes or gels to be stored in containers no larger than 100ml . A spokesman for London City Airport said it adheres to rules set out by the Department for Transport. Current rules require all liquids in containers over 100ml in size, including large bottles of water, lotions and perfume, to be stored in luggage in an aircraft’s hold. If large containers are found in a traveller’s hand luggage they will likely be thrown in the bin. The rule was implemented in 2006 after authorities foiled a terror plot to use liquid explosives to blow up several aircraft travelling from Heathrow to the US and Canada. But it is the European Commission’s goal to lift the ban and screen all liquids, lotions, powders, pastes and gels by January 2016 using laser scanning technology.","Kara Harrison said staff told her the spread breached liquid restrictions .

"Admission: Former US Air Force psychologist Dr James Mitchell . The man at the centre of the CIA’s brutal interrogation regime has revealed British agents were present at torture sites around the world where detainees were questioned. The admission by former US Air Force psychologist Dr James Mitchell comes after an explosive report by the Senate Intelligence Committee appeared to go to great lengths not to implicate MI5 or the Secret Intelligence Service in the torture programme. Mitchell, 62, who went by the alias Grayson Swigert, not only personally carried out countless torture sessions including waterboarding, on detainees, but was also responsible for devising the methods used. He set up a company, Mitchell Jessen and Associates, with former USAF colleague Bruce Jessen, which was paid £50 million to run the CIA interrogation programme. Last week, The Mail on Sunday asked him if British agents were present during his torture sessions, or were aware of the methods used. At first he said: ‘You will have to ask the CIA about that. I was moving around a lot.’ He then admitted: ‘I would see their [British] special operations people at the sites I would visit.’ The admission came as other allegations emerged pointing to British knowledge and collusion in the CIA’s torture programme. An MI6 agent who reported abuse of detainees in Afghanistan by his American colleagues in 2002 to his superiors in London was ordered not to intervene, according to a memo. The telegram from ‘Head Office Secret Intelligence Service’ to an agent working with the US in Afghanistan in January 2002 said: ‘It appears from your description that they may not be being treated in accordance with the appropriate standards. Torment: A prisoner of US forces is bound and hooded in Iraq following a raid in Baghdad . ‘Given that they are not within our custody or control, the law does not require you to intervene to prevent this.’ The telegram emerged last year during a truncated inquiry headed by retired judge Sir Peter Gibson. Sir Peter raised 27 a number serious questions over the UK’s involvement in the abduction and torture of terrorist suspects, and flagged up 40 cases needing ‘particular attention’. But the Gibson probe was replaced by an inquiry by the parliamentary Intelligence and Security Committee, which may not report until 2016. Former Security Minister Lord West also acknowledged British agents could even have been present during torture. He said there may have been the ‘odd case’ where agents knew about torture and failed to alert their superiors. He told the BBC: ‘Would we – as we dug around and had some huge inquiry– find that one agent or maybe two agents were once in a room when somebody was waterboarded? Possibly we might.’ Mitchell and Bruce Jessen, who also went by the name Hammond Dunbar, developed their murky skills at the USAF’s Survival, Evasion, Resistance and Escape school, where they taught servicemen how to resist torture. Their chance to turn the tables came when they became involved in the CIA’s ‘black site’ torture programme in 2002 after Al Qaeda suspect Abu Zubaydah was arrested in Pakistan. He was reportedly taken to Thailand, where a prison known as ‘detention site Green’ was set up. When he pitched to the CIA, Mitchell had proposed 12 key techniques to be used in interrogation: The attention grasp, [of the detainee’s collar] ‘walling’, [forcing the detainee against a wall], facial hold, facial slap, cramped confinement, standing, stress positions, sleep deprivation, waterboarding, use of nappies, use of insects and mock burial. Last week, Mitchell claimed his treatment of detainees did not constitute torture. ‘Waterboarding is not torture,’ he said. ‘If it was torture, why does the military subject thousands of service personnel to waterboarding as part of training?’","Dr James Mitchell was responsible for devising waterboarding methods .

"Abdul-Hakim Belhadj, former leader of the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group, wants to detail in court one of the most shameful episodes for British intelligence this century . A Libyan dissident kidnapped by US forces with the help of MI6 and delivered, along with his pregnant wife, to Muammar Gaddafi’s torturers says he will press ahead with a court case that threatens to reveal the full extent of British complicity with CIA abuse of terrorist suspects. In his only newspaper interview following the publication of the US Senate’s report on shocking torture by the CIA, Abdul-Hakim Belhadj told The Mail on Sunday it was now clear the level of British involvement had been covered up. ‘I want the Government to recognise and apologise for what was done,’ he said. ‘It is very sad that British intelligence played a key role in violations, including those against me and my wife. I recall with great pain what was done to us when my wife was pregnant. ‘When I recall those dreadful moments, it was not just a grave offence to us but to the British system that is supposed to uphold the law and respect human rights.’ Mr Belhadj, former leader of the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group, wants to detail in court one of the most shameful episodes for British intelligence this century. He says that in March 2004 – the same month Tony Blair did his ‘deal in the desert’ with Gaddafi – British intelligence helped the US arrange his rendition alongside his wife to Tripoli after they sought asylum in London. He says he was blindfolded and beaten in a ‘black prison’ in Thailand while his wife was chained to a wall. Once in Libya, he says he was tortured during six horrific years in jails including Tajoura and Abu Salim. Days after Gaddafi was overthrown in Tripoli, I found documents detailing startling collusion between Britain, the US and Libya in the destroyed residence of the British Ambassador. These included a series of questions sent by British spies for Gaddafi’s security forces to ask Belhadj. Another letter found elsewhere revealed Sir Mark Allen, then head of MI6’s counter-terrorism division, taking credit for capturing the couple. Mr Belhadj said British operatives even visited him in Tajoura prison, near Tripoli, ignoring his descriptions of the torture he endured – including beatings and being hung from hooks on the walls. Tony Blair embraces Colonel Gaddafi in 2007. The case could be very uncomfortable for Mr Blair and ex-Foreign Secretary Jack Straw . Grim: Abu Salim, one of the prisons where Mr Belhadj was held. He says he was tortured during six horrific years in jails . Mr Belhadj and his wife Fatima Bouchar demand the Government acknowledge their treatment, apologise and pay token damages. They are said to have rejected a seven-figure compensation offer – but without acceptance of guilt. ‘I consider this to be an issue of dignity that cannot be settled with money,’ said Mr Belhadj. He insists he has said from the outset he wants a formal apology and admission of abuse. ‘When they refused I wanted the judicial system to cast light on what happened to us.’ The Court of Appeal rejected government attempts to quash the case in October. Despite spending almost £400,000 of taxpayers’ cash already, Ministers are expected to make one final attempt at the Supreme Court next year. Whitehall officials claim British relations with the US could be damaged by the case – a spurious argument designed to shield their involvement in unethical practices and destroyed by the depth of revelations in the Senate report. Mr Belhadj’s lawyers fear the Government may seek a closed hearing. The case could be very uncomfortable for Mr Blair and ex-Foreign Secretary Jack Straw. The Islamist leader, now head of a political party in Tripoli, said that he welcomed the recent Senate disclosures. 'The American people know now what was done in their name,’ Mr Belhadj said. But he says he bears no anger towards Britain over his abuse, which includes allegations that his rendition flight from Thailand to Libya was allowed to refuel at Diego Garcia, the British Indian Ocean territory. ‘On the contrary I have a great deal of appreciation and thanks to the British people for standing with us after the Libyan revolution… and helping us end the tyrannical rule of Gaddafi. 'All I ask for is justice. It is up to the British judicial system to decide who was responsible and to hold them to account. These people gravely offended their electorate and the world in their complicity for what was done. ‘I would like my case to be a window for the British judiciary and public to see what was done in their name so that we can end such abuses in the future.’","Abdul-Hakim Belhadj is former leader of the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group .

"The feminist organisation behind controversial T-shirts made by women paid just 62p an hour is refusing to answer questions about its investigation into the workers’ conditions. The factory where shirts bearing the slogan This Is What A Feminist Looks Like were made for The Fawcett Society was first exposed by The Mail on Sunday last month. But six weeks after the ‘sweatshop’ conditions were first revealed, little progress appears to have been made in an ‘investigation’ into our report. The feminist organisation behind the controversial T-shirts made by women paid just 62p an hour is refusing to answer questions about its investigation into the workers’ conditions; pictured above is Labour deputy leader Harriet wearing the t-shirt in the Commons; Nick Clegg and Ed Miliband also wore the clothing item . The Fawcett Society’s chairman, Belinda Phipps, admitted the regime at Compagnie Mauricienne de Textile was ‘in complete contradiction to our own ethical policy’ The MoS faced a wall of silence last week from the Left-wing Fawcett Society and its partners, High Street chain Whistles and Elle magazine. Their £45 T-shirts were proudly worn by Labour deputy leader Harriet Harman in the Commons and also by Ed Miliband and Nick Clegg. When The Mail on Sunday revealed last month that workers in the Mauritius textile factory were paid just 62p an hour and were sleeping 16 to a room in dormitories, Fawcett Society deputy CEO Eva Neitzert vowed the organisation would do its utmost to investigate the story. Though the hourly rate is above the legal minimum wage in Mauritius, it is well short of the official government ‘living wage’ in the country. Three weeks ago, the society’s chairman, Belinda Phipps, admitted the regime at Compagnie Mauricienne de Textile (CMT) was ‘in complete contradiction to our own ethical policy’ but revealed the society was relying on Whistles and Made-By (a European not-for-profit ethical consultancy) to investigate CMT, and expecting the results within a fortnight. The MoS faced a wall of silence last week from the Left-wing Fawcett Society and its partners, High Street chain Whistles and Elle magazine; the stonewalling came as two of our journalists involved in the exposé were banned from freely travelling to the Indian Ocean island . Yet last week there was still no outward sign of any report and our numerous calls and emails to The Fawcett Society, Whistles and Elle produced no response. Called at home, Ms Phipps said: ‘There’s nothing to add. You should speak to our press spokesperson.’ The stonewalling came as two of our journalists involved in the exposé were banned from freely travelling to the Indian Ocean island. Last week reporter Ben Ellery and photographer John McLellan received official letters from the Mauritius government imposing restrictions on their right to travel to the country. The letters, sent from the Mauritius Passport and Immigration Office and bearing an official stamp, state: ‘I am directed to inform you that you should not undertake any travel to Mauritius without prior authority from this office.’ When the MoS contacted the office, a spokesman said: ‘It is because of the article. If you fly here without asking for permission first, then you will be sent back.’","The t-shirts were made for The Fawcett Society at a Mauritius textile factory .

"Scroll down for video . The U.S. Navy has altered its hair guidelines following controversy that saw a woman kicked out for refusing to change her style. Jessica Sims, who had been serving for 12 years, wore dreadlocks in a small bun. Senior officers then asked her to straighten her hair and tie it up tighter. She refused and, as a result, was honorably discharged for 'serious misconduct'. Now the Navy has put a hold on the case to review the  circumstances. Controversial: Jessica Sims, who had been serving for 12 years, wore dreadlocks in a small bun. Senior officers then asked her to straighten her hair and tie it up tighter. She refused and was honorably discharged . Updating regulations: The Navy has this week altered its guidelines which states a bun can be three inches from a servicewomen's scalp . This week the Navy updated regulations extending to 19 approved hairstyles. It included a new style - the two strand twist - and increased the bun size from two inches in diameter to four. Dreadlocks however are still forbidden. They are unauthorized along with ponytails, pigtails and braids that are 'widely spaced and/or protrude from the head.' In an interview with the Navy Times, Sims argued that she had been wearing the same style for the majority of her career and was not sure why she was being asked to change it now\ . She said: 'I don't think I should be told that I have to straighten my hair in order to be within what they think the regulations are, and I don't think I should have to cover it up with a wig.' 'I do think that it's a race issue. The majority of the hairstyles that have the strictest regulations are hairstyles that black women would wear' she added.' Navy regulations state that hair can't protrude more than two inches from the head, so in order to make it lie flat, black women typically weave their hair into tight braids, cornrow it or straighten it using hot tools or chemical relaxers. Wigs are also common. Navy regulations specifically ban 'widely spaced individual hanging locks,' according to section 2201.1. Sims says her locks are narrow enough to be in keeping with the rule. Speaking to the site, Sims insisted that as she tied her hair back she fit in with regulations. However her commanding officers disagreed. Commenting on the case Lt. Stephanie Homick, Spokesperson for the Chief of Naval Personnel, said: 'We hold every sailor to the same standard. It’s not on an individual basis. We are the military.' Changes: There are now 19 approved Navy hairstyles. The 'two strand twist' was added to the list. Dreadlocks however are still forbidden . The first line of the recently updated rules state: 'Hairstyles and haircuts shall present a professional and balanced appearance. 'Appropriateness of a hairstyle shall be evaluated by its appearance when headgear is worn. All headgear shall fit snugly and comfortably around the largest part of the head without distortion or excessive gaps. 'Hairstyles will not interfere with the proper wearing of headgear, protective masks or equipment. 'When headgear is worn, hair shall not show from under the front of the headgear, with the exception of the Tiara and Beret. 'Hair (including bun) is not to protrude from the opening in the back of the ball cap.'","Jessica Sims was asked to change her hairstyle to fit force guidelines .

"In China there is a place where it's Christmas every day. But this is not because everyone gets to open presents brought by Santa Claus all year round – it's more much commercial than that. Two hours by train from Shanghai lies the market town of Yiwu in Zhejiang province. A holiday shopper’s paradise, it is filled with storefront vendors selling all manner of small commodities, but it's biggest business is Christmas.

The International Business Times reported the stalls at Yiwu's indoor market is overflowing with trees, lights, decorations, tinsel, bows and just about everything connected to the festive season. Unlike the rest of the world, it’s almost a year-round business for Yiwu Christmas market vendors. It's so large that the market will take more than a day to walk around, and to say that the traders here sell in bulk is an understatement. According to a report by Chinese website Sina News, Yiwu produces about 60 per cent of the world’s Christmas decorations and more than 90 percent of China’s Christmas decorations. For other Christmas decoration factories and retailers in China, Christmas starts as early as July and ends in late September, when massive orders from around the world flood in. An employee makes plastic Christmas trees at the Zhongsheng Christmas Crafts factory in Yiwu . Yiwu is considered a bellwether for China's low-cost exports, especially exports destined for emerging markets, reported Reuters. Orders come from places as far away as Europe, the United States and South America. This year however, European demand for Christmas goods has dropped sharply, local vendors said. One estimated European orders were down 20 percent from last year, while another said his European orders had fallen by 40 percent. According to Sina, the vice chairman for the Yiwu Christmas Products Industry Association, Cai Qingliang, said that although overseas sales have dwindled this year, domestic orders have increased. A man walks past a Christmas decoration advertisement on the wall of a shop in Yiwu, Zhejiang province . Plastic Santa Claus toys are displayed at a Christmas shop in Yiwu's commercial district . “I sell Christmas trees from March to December,” a shopkeeper with the surname Ji, told CNN. “Most customers buy 3,000 (yuan) to 4,000 yuan trees.” China may not celebrate Christmas in the religious or traditional sense, but towns like Yiwu can make the most out of it from a business point of view. “The market is the town,” said another vendor, who gave her name as He. “Other towns are far away. It takes time for products to get there. Here, it’s always Christmas.” Natalia Malharoblishvki from Georgia buys Christmas decorations from a Yiwu market shop . While for some Yiwu factory workers, the whole idea of Christmas is lost on them. “Maybe it’s the [Chinese] New Year for foreigners,” 19-year-old Wei, a local worker, told CNN. Wei and his father work in the factory together, contributing to Christmas by making plastic snowflakes for about 10 hours a day, every day. And even though Wei’s father wears a Santa hat to work  it protects his hair from the red dye that consumes the factory – he doesn’t plan on celebrating the holiday.

"Ah, you've come for some Marie Antoinette budgeting tips,' says Anne Jenkin as she greets me at the door of her home in South London. Sure enough, two small homemade jam cakes straight from the oven are on the table as I enter her kitchen. She can smile about it now, but only just. In fact, I have come for one of her now-famous 4p porridge breakfasts. Four days earlier, Baroness Jenkin of Kennington sparked a major political row after declaring 'the poor can't cook' at a Commons press conference. Digging an even deeper hole, she added insult to injury by saying she had had a bowl of porridge costing 4p that very morning, so much better value than 'a bowl of sugary cereals which will cost you 25p'. It wasn't just the patronising way it sounded. Scroll down for video . Tucking in: Baroness Jenkin dishes up a thrifty bowl of porridge for Mail on Sunday Political Editor Simon Walters . It was who said it, a Baroness not from one Tory dynasty, but two. A year's hard work of research into hunger and food banks by a Parliamentary group sponsored by the Archbishop of Canterbury no less – sitting right next to Jenkin when she put her Size Six feet in her mouth –went straight into the anaerobic food incinerator. 'The world went mad,' she says. 'I had death threats. 'Where does she live? Let's go and get her,' that kind of thing. 'The eye of the storm is a deeply unpleasant place to be.' In self-flagellating mood, she reads aloud one letter: 'You are callous, disgusting, bloody nasty and should be stripped of your title.' Jenkin relives her blunder in agonising slow motion. 'I meant to say everyone we met at food banks told us how they wished we had not lost traditional cooking skills. But I hadn't written it down and somehow it came out as 'poor people can't cook'. Then I mentioned my 4p porridge. 'I couldn't believe it, we had produced a report with 78 recommendations and those four words became the story.' Far from eating her words, so to speak, the Baroness even produced a three-course dinner menu for The Mail on Sunday, that costs just 57p a head . She went ahead with a long-scheduled House of Lords speech on world poverty the next day, but was so shaken, she removed the word 'poor' from every section to avoid further ridicule. But it requires more than that to take the fizz out of Jenkin, a bundle of energy and fun – as she demonstrated by agreeing to cook porridge for me at her Kennington home. And far from eating her words, so to speak, she even produced a three-course dinner menu for The Mail on Sunday, that costs just 57p a head. They don't come more High Tory than Anne. Husband, Conservative MP Bernard Jenkin is the son of Thatcher-era Cabinet Minister Patrick Jenkin. Her grandfather was the 1st Viscount Davidson. She went out with film-maker Richard Curtis at Oxford before marrying Bernard. Curtis got playful revenge by planting a wallyish character called Bernard in most of his films, including Love Actually. A mother of two grown-up sons, she is the kind of Tory MP's wife who went out of fashion years ago: She believes, having been born into privilege, it is her duty to give something back. Good housekeeping and plain speaking are in her blood. Her grandmother, Tory MP Joan Davidson got into trouble in the 1940s for saying: 'I feed my children on bread and dripping.' Jenkin says: 'She got the same bucketload over that as I did.' For all her wealth, no one can say Baroness Jenkin does not know her onions when it comes to living on the breadline. Every year she takes part in a Live Below The Line campaign, living on a pound a day for a week to draw attention to hunger in the Third World. She is no blue-rinsed dinosaur and helped David Cameron recruit more women Tory MPs via her successful Women2Win group. The Twitter trolls are noisy, but not in the majority. For all her wealth, no one can say Baroness Jenkin does not know her onions when it comes to living on the breadline: every year she takes part in a Live Below The Line campaign, living on a pound a day for a week to draw attention to hunger in the Third World and has previouslyprepared food in the House of Lords for a soup kitchen (pictured) A Geordie probation officer wrote to her, expressing his disgust at seeing layabout couples on benefits 'hanging around outside courts all day in the sunshine eating steak and chips and drinking bottles of [light perry] Lambrini while stuffing 'Greggs dummies' [sausage rolls or pasties] in the mouths of babies in top-of-the-range buggies'. Former Labour Commons Speaker Baroness Betty Boothroyd congratulated her. 'Betty told me 'you're completely right' and that when she grew up, every week they would get 'a ninepenny rabbit' for supper at the end of market day.' Gaining confidence, Jenkin says: 'I looked up the dictionary definition of poor. It is 'lacking sufficient money to live at a standard considered comfortable or normal in a society.' It's as close as saying 'I was right' as she will go. Naive maybe, hypocrite no. As she prepares a bowl of her 4p porridge with oats from Aldi cooked in water, she makes a cup of filter coffee, using folded paper towels as a filter, not dearer, shop-bought filters. She scrounged her coffee mugs. 'Got them from a skip,' she declares with a bargain-hunter's pride. 'I was at a conference and they said it was cheaper for them to throw them away than wash them up!' Jenkin freely admits her political shortcomings. 'I'm an amateur in a pro's game. That's why I made a cock-up. If I hadn't had so much support from friends and others, I would have crawled under the duvet. 'Then I thought: I'm not hiding under a tin hat, I'm going to go out there and say what I believe: Why it's crazy that families throw away £40 worth of food a month, supermarkets throw away 68 per cent of salad bags and fields full of edible food are chucked because they look wonky. 'I regret being so clumsy, but let's face it, if I hadn't, you wouldn't be here listening to me talking about the scandal of food waste, would you?' Or eating a 4p bowl of Aldi porridge with a spoonful of Aldi honey.Not bad, although I confess I prefer mine with decadent Waitrose raspberries and Greek yoghurt at 40p per bowl – and rising. It's not on the menu in Anne's kitchen. Her 'poor can't cook' blunder took the shine off her 59th birthday on the day the food banks report was launched.

Conservatives in the fight to stop Scotland ending its 307-year . union with England, exposed the cracks in Labour's Scottish . stronghold. Labour's failure was laid bare when it was left to former . Labour prime minister Gordon Brown, rather than the local party, . to rally fellow Scots against independence. Brown, 63, who has announced he is stepping down at the next election. Mr Murphy, right, was elected along with Kezia Dugdale, left, who is the party's new deputy leader in Scotland . Murphy was centre-stage during the referendum campaign, touring Scotland and giving speeches standing on his Irn-Bru crate. He won this morning's election despite the trade union movement supporting former bricklayer Neil Findlay. Leader of the Scottish National Party and First Minister Nicola Sturgeon congratulated Mr Murphy and Ms Dugdale's election. She said: 'I know that the challenges of leadership are never easy, so I offer my best wishes for the job they have ahead. 'While we will undoubtedly cross swords often in the months ahead, my door is always open to those who wish to find common ground and work together in the best interests of people in Scotland – something I hope we will have the opportunity to do.' Union Unite criticised today's decision to support Mr Murphy ahead of their preferred candidate. Pat Rafferty, secretary of Unite Scotland said: 'Neil Findlay offered a genuine alternative to the politics and policies that led to consecutive electoral defeats for Scottish Labour and the haemorrhaging thousands of members. 'Unite was proud to support Neil and his share of the vote is enough to show his popular policies have resonance among working people in Scotland. 'Arguably, Jim Murphy recognised this appetite for real change during the hustings, because as the campaign progressed his arguments became bolder on issues like taxation and a living wage. Jim now needs to turn words into action if he wants to start the process of re-building Scottish Labour.' Speaking after his victory, Mr Murphy said: 'This is a fresh start for Scottish Labour. A new generation is in charge. But it’s only the beginning.' He said: 'Inequality is wrong. And Scottish Labour's mission is to end it. 'It makes me angry that kids from poor backgrounds are three times less likely to get good grades than those from prosperous backgrounds.' Labour leader Ed Miliband congratulated Mr Murphy and his new deputy leader. 'Jim showed in the referendum campaign that he is a fighter. He showed in the leadership campaign that he is a leader. I am going to be standing shoulder to shoulder with Jim in the campaign to get David Cameron out at the General Election. 'Jim has already shown how he will use increased powers for the Scottish Parliament for a new 50p top income tax rate for people earning more than £150,000. 'Together we will show how a Labour government can change the lives of working people in Scotland. 'The fight to get the Tories out is now on. It is a fight we intend to win.'","Jim Murphy has been elected leader of the Scottish Labour Party .

"A record number of NHS patients were left waiting for treatment at accident and emergency wards last week, official figures have revealed. Some 35,373 patients had to wait for longer than four hours to be seen - an increase of 66 per cent on the same period last year. At the same time the number of people kept on a trolley for between four and 12 hours before a bed was found doubled from 3,666 to 7,760. Some 35,373 patients had to wait for longer than four hours to be seen - an increase of 66 per cent on the same period last year . Labour’s shadow health secretary Andy Burnham said last week was ‘the worst week on record for patients waiting at A&E’. He added: ‘Before the Commons breaks for Christmas, ministers need to come and set out the measures they will take to help the NHS cope over the Christmas period. ‘Labour has been warning the Government for months about the growing crisis in A&E but it has failed to act. But even ministers must now accept that these figures are a worrying wake up call. They are proof you can't trust the Tories with the NHS. ‘David Cameron has allowed A&E to sink into crisis and must now accept his responsibility to turn it around.’ Dr Cliff Mann, president of the College of Emergency Medicine and an A&E doctor at the Taunton and Somerset Hospital, told BBC Radio 4's World At One it was ‘a tough year’ for casualty departments across the country. ‘As the figures show this morning, we are seeing record numbers of people attending our A&E departments and record numbers of people being admitted to our hospitals,’ said Dr Mann. ‘It's rather too often like trying to get a quart into a pint pot. There's a real pressure on beds, particularly between the hours of about 10 o'clock in the morning to 10 o'clock at night. ‘It does mean that an awful lot of patients are waiting rather longer than they should be to get into hospital, and that backing up in the A&E department then means there's a problem off-loading patients from ambulance trolleys.’ Shadow Health Secretary Andy Burnham said last week was ‘the worst week on record for patients waiting at A&E’ Richard Murray, director of policy at the health think tank the King's Fund, told the programme: ‘It is pretty bleak. The performance numbers that have come out this week are probably the worst we've seen at this time of year for a very long time. And the number of people showing up at A&E is continually bouncing at the highest level the NHS has ever seen. ‘This is only December. This is not the peak of the winter period.’ Dame Barbara Hakin, the national director of commissioning operations for NHS England, told World At One: ‘The NHS is under a huge amount of pressure at the moment. We are seeing far more patients than we ever have before. ‘But we are still making sure that 91 out of 100 patients receive their treatment - they are either admitted or discharged from hospital - within four hours, which is a really high standard of care. ‘Of course we are not complacent. The standard we set ourselves was that it would be 95 out of 100 patients. We have got plans in place to ensure that as we go through the winter, our patients can still be seen swiftly and promptly.’ She added: ‘The NHS in England is planning to ensure that it can deliver safe services for patients over the winter.’ Dame Barbara said that NHS England was putting in an extra £700 million for more beds, doctors and nurses, as well as additional services in the community. ‘This is so that we can be prepared for January and February, which we always know are busy months,’ she said. ‘The money has gone into direct frontline services and we are already seeing plenty of places where they've got extra beds in place and extra staff. Obviously, sometimes it takes time to recruit staff and open up wards, but the money is available for the front line.’ But Dr Mann said that ‘very little’ of the £700 million earmarked for frontline services had reached emergency departments, meaning that only ‘a small number’ of doctors and nurses were able to be recruited at short notice to respond to the pressure of patient numbers. ‘I suspect that a lot of it has gone to shoring up balance sheets in acute trusts, who are probably rather more concerned about the reputation they have with (regulator) Monitor than anything else at the moment,’ said Dr Mann.","Number of people kept on a trolley between four and 12 hours doubles .

"Two Australian women have slipped out of the country to join terrorists in the Middle East as potential jihadi brides, authorities believe. It is thought that an 18-year-old and her 20-year-old friend made their way to Syria  after they told their parents they were going on a holiday, according to the Sunday Telegraph. The pair from Sydney, believed to be travelling independently to the region, could face the consequences of their actions of up to 10 years in jail if they try to return to Australia. Scroll down for video . Two Australian women have slipped out of the country to join terrorists as potential jihadi brides, reports say . Foreign Minister Julie Bishop admits that new reports of young Australians travelling overseas to join the Islamic State is a 'deeply disturbing phenomenon', writes the Sunday Telegraph. 'We are now seeing examples of young women being radicalised and travelling to Syria and Iraq to take part in fighting for listed terrorists organisations,' she said. It comes just a day after the father of  Australian jihadist Amira Karroum, who was killed in January after joining her radicalised husband and al-Qaeda fighters in  Syria, says he plans to sue the Australian government for his 'angel's' death. During an explosive interview with Channel Nine's A Current Affair program on Friday, Mohamed Karroum says he blames Australian authorities for his daughter's death because they allowed radical Islamic recruiters into the country and they 'allowed her to leave'. In one shocking comment, an angry Mr Karroum tells journalist Lisa Goddard: . 'I'm praying to the Lord every day, Tony Abbott, please Lord, let him lose one of his daughter, either in sickness or in accident or something, please Lord.' It is thought that an 18-year-old and her 20-year-old friend made their way to Syria after they told their parents they were going on a holiday . Amira Karroum (pictured) was killed in January after joining her radicalised husband and al-Qaeda fighters in Syria . Educated at an Anglican private school in Queensland, Amira Karroum became a devout Muslim, donning the hijab, after moving to Sydney with her sister in 2011 . In an interview on Channel Nine's A Current Affair program, a grieving Mohamed Karroum says the Australian government has his daughter's blood on its hands . Prime Minister Tony Abbott (middle) with his two daughters Frances (left) and Bridget (right) 'The Australian government is the mother and father of her, they are the ones who control everything in this country,' Mr Karroum told A Current Affair. 'I want to take the federal government to court; they are responsible for the death of my daughter.' Amira, 22, described by her father as a 'beautiful girl' who loved barbecues and dancing with her friends, was in war-torn Syria with her new  husband Tyler Perry, also known as Yusef Ali. The pair met and married in 2013, before Ali travelled to fight with al-Qaeda in Syria. After the Australian government stopped Amira from trying to leave the country on two occasions, she told family she was going to meet Ali for a vacation in Copenhagen. Her body was found shot and dismembered beside her husband's   in a house in Aleppo, just three weeks after she left Australia. Mohammed Karroum recalled the last message his daughter sent him shortly before her death. 'Please Dad, pray to Allah and ask him to forgive you for the days, for the years you have not prayed for him, death is around the corner Dad. I love you,' he recalled. He says he 'just can't believe' his daughter became an al-Qaeda fighter. Mohamed Karroum says Yusef Ali, a known extremist, 'poisoned' his daughter's mind . One of the posts from Amira's Facebook page, where she said she worked as a 'Slave of Allah'. Mohamed Karroum believes Ali was a trained al-Qaeda killer who was known to Australian authorities. 'I believe she was sacrificed because they were trying to take somebody to court, and they knew she would lead them to him,' he said. 'The Australian Federal Police and ASIO are not doing their job, this is the fact.' He is now looking for a lawyer to help him take the federal government to court.

"As the iconic British car of the 1960s, motorists all over the world want to own a classic Mini Cooper. Nearly 15 years after Austin stopped producing the vehicles, fans will pay in excess of $20,000 to make one their own. But one driver in Port Elizabeth, New Jersey, who purchased the car had their dreams demolished - when US customs crushed the car and turned it into scrap.

U.S. Customs and Border Protection officials are trying to prevent those Minis, as well as Land Rover Defenders, that don't meet U.S. safety and emissions standards from entering the country. If they make it, the vehicles are seized from owners who thought they had followed proper procedures. In the case of the Mini destroyed on Thursday at Price's Auto Recyclers in Plumsted, New Jersey, Leon Hayward, assistant director of trade & cargo security at the U. S. Customs and Border Protection's New York Field Office, said the Mini left England destined for the Newark seaport. According to NJ.com the Mini was likely manufactured in 2000 but the Vehicle Identification Number, or VIN, had been changed to disguise the car as a 1988 model in an effort to skirt federal safety and emission standards.

"A war of words between Australian comedian Adam Hills and a controversial American church group has intensified, over their threat to picket Robin Williams memorial. Hills, who hosts British television show The Last Leg, has been in an ongoing Twitter battle with the Westboro Church after they claimed 'Robin Williams was in hell' for staring as a gay character in various films and supporting the US troops. The threat, made by a church leader in a video message, angered Hills who fired a shot at the church on his television show and offered to fly members 'first class' to Iraq to picket extreme Islamists instead. Scroll down for video . Adam Hills offered to pay for the controversial American church group to fly to Iraq and picket Islamists converting Christians to Islam . In response to Hills rant, the Westboro Church claimed it had picketed in Iraq before . In the rant Hills offered to 'personally pay for every member of the Westboro Baptist Church to fly to Iraq right now.' 'If you really believe in standing up to those threatening the Christian way of life, Westboro Baptist Church, how about putting your money where your mouth is, taking a direct flight to Iraq and picketing the people threatening to behead Christians if they don’t convert?' Robin Williams was the subject of an anti-gay video posted by the Westboro Church . Hills said there was one or two things he believed would happen to church members in Iraq, if they chose to fly. 'Either you’ll die while defending your beliefs and you’ll be carried away to heaven by a gold chariot to sit at the right hand of God for all eternity.' 'OR if I’m right, and I’m willing to bet a dozen first class flights that I am, God will be standing at the pearly gates alongside a 5ft 8 hairy American comedian dressed as a middle aged Scottish nanny saying, ‘Heeeellllooooo’.

The enthralling battle between chief protagonists Lyon and Kohli ended in the 82nd over. India's stand-in skipper holed out on 141, Mitch Marsh misreading the ball but completing an awkward catch in the deep. Ryan Harris and Mitchell Johnson claimed a wicket each after the final drinks break. But Lyon fittingly ended the game when he had Ishant Sharma stumped and India all out for 315 in the 88th over. Lyon finished with incredible match figures of 12-286, bouncing back superbly after an underwhelming tour of the UAE, where he captured three Test wickets at an average of 140. Michael Clarke was forced from the field with another hamstring injury on the last day of the First Test against India in Adelaide, raising doubts he will be able to play in the rest of the series. The Australian captain went down fielding a ground ball at mid wicket after lunch and left the field clutching his right hamstring. He was assisted back to the sheds by team physiotherapist Alex Kountouris. This latest setback continues a terrible run of injuries for Clarke, who had been in doubt of playing the first Test scheduled for Brisbane before the freak accident which caused the death of his 'little brother' Phillip Hughes. Australian captain Michael Clarke walks from the Adelaide Oval with team physiotherapist Alex Kountouris after suffering another injury in the first Test against India. Australian physiotherapist Alex Koutouris rushes to the aid of captain Michael Clarke. Michael Clarke is in serious doubt for the second Test starting in Brisbane on Wednesday, after suffering another injury fielding at the Adelaide Oval today. Clarke strained his left hamstring in a one day international in Perth last month, then suffered a recurrence of a degenerative back injury that forced him to retire hurt on 60 while batting on Tuesday. The 33-year-old returned the next day after extensive treatment to post a courageous 128 and has been fielding in pain during the Indians' two innings. Clarke was sent for scans after leaving the field today but this latest injury would appear to make it highly unlikely he will play in the second Test beginning in Brisbane on Wednesday. He may miss the rest of the series. Michael Clarke leaves the field after being dismissed on day four of the first Test in Adelaide. Michael Clarke dives to field a ball on the fourth day of the first Test. Australia declared its second innings closed at 5/290, with Steve Smith - who scored 162 not out in the first innings - again left unbeaten on 52. Brad Haddin was not out on 14. David Warner, who scored 145 in the first innings, knocked up 102 in the second. The overnight declaration left India with a target of 364 for victory today.

"Nine men have been sentenced to more than 88 years in prison after cocaine with a street value of more than £5million was seized by police. The gang was arrested between May and October last year after a year-long investigation and sentenced at Luton Crown Court yesterday. The court heard 15kg of cocaine was smuggled into the UK from France and found by police hidden among cans of fruit in a lorry driven by one of the men. Six of the men - Jonathan Mason, Robert Webb, Patrick Dyett, Gareth Harnett, Sean Martin and Andrew Dawson had all pleaded guilty to conspiracy to supply Class A drugs at an earlier hearing. Leading role: Jonathan Mason, left, was sentenced to 15 years and right, Robert Webb was handed 13 years . Three others - Daren Coomber, Paul Nolan and Eamon Ward - had all entered not guilty pleas but were found guilty of conspiracy to supply Class A drugs after a trial in September. Mason, 45, of Ramsgate, Kent, was sentenced to 15 years and Webb, 55, of Broadstairs, Kent, was sentenced to 13 years. Both were identified as having a leading role in the operation. Coomber, 41, of Ash, Kent, was sentenced to 14 years in prison. Nolan, 36, of Dover, Kent, was sentenced to 11 years. Guilty: Paul Nolan, left, was sentenced to 11 years and right, Daren Coomber, was given 14 years . Jailed: Patrick Dyett, left, was sentenced to eight years and six months and Gareth Harnett, right, was given five years and four months . Dyett, 31, of Poole, Dorset was sentenced to eight years and six months. Harnett, 32, of Broadstairs, Kent, was sentenced to five years and four months in prison. Ward, 28, of County Down, Ireland, was sentenced to 10 years and five months in prison. Martin, 32, of Bedford, was sentenced to six years in prison and Dawson, 45, of Clophill, Bedfordshire, was sentenced to five years and four months in prison. Eamon Ward, left, was sentenced to 10 years and five months and right, Sean Martin got six years . The court heard that initial arrests and searches in Bedfordshire resulted in the recovery of a large quantity of cocaine along with cutting equipment from a garage in Clophill. A search in July in Broadstairs, Kent resulted in 7kg of cocaine being recovered as well as cutting agents and other equipment. Police had earlier seized 2kg of cocaine in Norfolk linked to the group. Later, a further 15kg of cocaine was found hidden among cans of fruit in a lorry at an industrial estate near Dover, directly after the lorry had entered the UK from France. A further earlier seizure of 2kg of cocaine in Norfolk was directly linked to the Bedfordshire part of the operation. The combined value of cocaine seized during the operation amounted to an estimated wholesale price of £1million . But the overall street price of cocaine seized during the year-long operation amounted to more than £5million . The combined value of the cocaine seized during the operation amounted to an estimated wholesale price of £1million and overall street price of just over £5million. The court heard that Mason, claimed to be a property developer and was seen to construct a two- storey extension at his own home which was then furnished with high-end fittings. Dawson was sentenced to five years and four months in prison . Webb claimed to be retired, but was largely responsible for arranging the transportation of the drugs. Dyett, who was living in an affluent area in Poole and owns the Sandbanks Horse Racing Club, drove a Bentley and purported to be a professional sports gambler. He was also regarded to have played a 'leading role' in a conspiracy to supply cocaine across the region. All of the other men were regarded as having undertaken various significant roles in the conspiracy to supply and distribute the cocaine. Nolan was the owner of a haulage company,  in whose lorry the drugs were found and Ward was the driver. The court heard Harnett had been arrested in June for an unrelated matter in Scotland while in possession of 30kg of cannabis. A subsequent search of a premises linked to that arrest led to the recovery of a further 120kg of cannabis derivatives. Martin and Dawson were involved in the 'cutting' and onward distribution from Bedfordshire into East Anglia. Detective Inspector Gary Atkinson, from the Eastern Region Specialist Operations Unit, who led the investigation, said: 'Cocaine destroys lives and those sentences today operated purely for their own greed and monetary gain with no regard for the law, nor for the lives of those who are vulnerable through their addictions. 'The calculated and planned criminal activities which fuelled their enterprise were, in their eyes, merely business transactions, which had we not intercepted them - would have played a significant contributory factor in destroying more lives.' 15kg of cocaine was found hidden among cans of fruit in a lorry at an industrial estate near Dover . The drugs were seized directly after the lorry, which was driven by Ward, had entered the UK from France .","The drugs gang was arrested between May and October last year .

"For the second time this year, a Russian military aircraft turned off its transponders to avoid commercial radar and nearly collided with a passenger jet over Sweden, officials have revealed. Swedish authorities yesterday said a Russian military aircraft nearly collided above southern Sweden with a commercial passenger jet that had taken off on Friday from Copenhagen. Swedish Defense Minister Peter Hultqvist told a local radio station: 'This is serious. This is inappropriate. This is outright dangerous when you turn off the transponder.' For the second time this year, a Russian military aircraft turned off its transponders to avoid commercial radar and nearly collided with a passenger jet over Sweden, officials have revealed; pictured above is a Russian fighter jet which was spotted off the coast of Norway in 2007 . In October RAF Typhoon jets were scrambled to track this Russian Tu-95 Bear H bomber, one of two which flew close to Britain without filing flight plans or communicating with air traffic controllers. Some 26 intercepts were made in around 24 hours . Officials at Russia's Ministry of Defense in Moscow were not immediately available to comment. Sweden's air force chief, Major General Micael Byden, said the incident in international air space looked 'pretty serious,' adding the southern-bound commercial flight was immediately ordered to change course. Swedish fighter jets were sent up to identify the aircraft, and later confirmed it as a Russian intelligence plane. Media in Sweden and Denmark said the commercial plane was en route to Poland, but the carrier and the number of passengers it has on board has not been reported. Byden said this was not as serious as in March when a Russian plane flying without transponders came within 300 feet of an SAS plane that had taken off from Copenhagen. In recent months, Russia has increased its military presence in the Baltic Sea area, prompting some Swedish officials to compare it to the Cold War . In October, non-NATO Sweden launched its first submarine hunt since the collapse of the Soviet Union. Swedish authorities said a small, foreign submarine had entered its waters illegally but never found it and didn't disclose its nationality .

"The life of former England footballer Paul Gascoigne is set to be turned into a hit movie, it has been reported today. An Oscar-nominated production team is said to have been lined up to make a film about the ups and downs of the 47-year-old's life, including his playing days and his battle with drink. Early indications suggest that producers are considering calling the movie 'Gazza - British Raging Bull' - and the former football star wants Sean Bean to play him. Scroll down for video . The life of former England footballer Paul Gascoigne (pictured on ITV's This Morning last month) is set to be turned into a hit movie, it has been reported today . Early indications suggest that producers are considering calling the movie 'Gazza - British Raging Bull' - and the former football star (left) wants Sean Bean (right) to play him . A source close to the Gascoigne told the Daily Star that the film was already at 'planning stage'. 'An initial contract has been signed. We're working with a well-respected production company who have been nominated for an Oscar in the past. 'Paul has had an incredible life and we know they'll do it justice on screen. He's very excited.' The newspaper reported that 55-year-old Sean Bean may be ruled out of playing the lead role on account of his age. It suggested EastEnders star Danny Dyer, 37, and Skins actor Jack O'Connell, 24, were contenders for the part. MailOnline has contacted Gascoigne's representatives for a comment this morning. The former Newcastle United and Tottenham Hotspur player won 57 caps for England and made a series of memorable performances for his country during the World Cup in 1990 and the 1996 European Championships, earning him legendary status among many  supporters. EastEnders star Danny Dyer (left), 37, and Skins actor Jack O'Connell (right), 24, are also said to be contenders for the part . An Oscar-nominated production team is said to have been lined up to make a film about the 47-year-old's life. He is pictured scoring a memorable goal against Scotland during the European Championships in 96 . Last month, he spoke about his ongoing battle with booze in a TV interview. The 47-year-old, who retired from the game in 2004, admitted  that he 'knew he was in trouble straight away' after his most recent relapse - which saw him placed on a three-day emergency detox in October. Speaking in an interview on ITV's This Morning, Gascoigne looked healthy and relaxed as he told presenters Ruth Langsford and Eamonn Holmes about his struggle. He said that he wasn't in a 'massive state' during his most recent relapse, but admitted that it was enough 'to get himself into trouble'. In an interview with The Sun he claimed that the episode was only a 'blip. He said: 'I was doing well, but every day was like Groundhog Day - doing the same thing - and I started drinking again. I was going to the gym, going shopping then going home. I just had a little blip. I messed up.

"Theresa May's troubled child abuse inquiry suffered a fresh setback last night as it emerged that a rival investigation is to be held by a top human rights lawyer. Michael Mansfield QC, who represented Mohamed Al Fayed at the inquests into the deaths of Princess Diana and Al Fayed’s son Dodi, has been appointed as the judge of a new ‘people’s tribunal’ on historic abuse claims. The Home Secretary’s official inquiry has barely started, even though it was launched several months ago. Scroll down for video . Michael Mansfield QC (pictured) has been appointed judge of a new 'people's tribunal', aimed at investigating historic claims of child abuse . First, ex-judge Baroness Butler-Sloss and then corporate lawyer Fiona Woolf had to resign from chairing it because of their links to figures alleged to have been involved in a cover-up of VIP paedophile rings. But just like the Government’s inquiry, the new tribunal – set up by child abuse campaigners – has been beset by problems. Only weeks after the steering committee was appointed, four members resigned, citing attacks on social media. Home Secretary Theresa May's (pictured) troubled child abuse inquiry has now suffered a fresh setback with the formation of a rival investigation . Among them was ex-social worker Liz Davies, a leading child protection expert. Organisers insist it is not in conflict with the Government’s inquiry but will instead complement it. However, its website suggests that there will be an element of competition. It says: ‘This tribunal is necessary because the Government initiative has serious shortcomings.’ Questions have also been raised about its funding. Organisers say they hope to raise money from the public, partly by selling wristbands carrying the slogan ‘sweep away the secrecy’. The tribunal will hold public hearings across Britain at which abuse survivors will tell their stories, and will produce a report within a year that will be submitted to Theresa May’s inquiry as well as other institutions. As it is entirely unofficial, it has no legal powers requiring witnesses to come forward. Mrs May will face questions from MPs tomorrow on the lack of progress with the investigation and the struggle to find a suitable chairman. At least 100 names have been put forward after Mrs Woolf had to step down, following The Mail on Sunday’s revelation that she has close links to former Home Secretary Leon Brittan.","New investigation established to look into historic child abuse claims .

"This is the moment a gun activist interrupted a pre-wedding photo shoot to offer the best man, the bride and groom the chance to pose with an assault rifle. The wedding party were standing on the steps of the Capitol building in Olympia, Washington, when the demonstrator walked over. Holding up the powerful weapon, he asked whether they would like to hold it in their romantic shots. At first the best man obliged, grasping the rifle in front of the camera, before the groom accepted and did the same. He then walked over and held up the gun as his soon-to-be wife put her arm around him. Shoot: Brandon Lyons, left, of Spanaway, Washington hands his AR-10 rifle to the best man in a wedding party on the steps of the Capitol building in Olympia, Washington. All of them declined to be identified . Locked and loaded: The best man then holds the weapon up as the couple watch . Showing off: He then pulls a pose to stand out on his own in front of the government building . The groom then decides to take the weapon for himself and stands alongside his soon-to-be wife with the gun . The interruption came as around 1,000 gun-rights advocates, many openly carrying rifles and handguns, rallied l to protest a new expanded gun background check law in Washington state. Organizers of the 'I Will Not Comply' rally promised to exchange and sell firearms without conducting background checks during the daylong rally in opposition to the state's voter-approved universal background check law. 'We're going to stand up for our rights,' rally organizer Gavin Seim said. 'Our rights are not up for negotiation.' Initiative 594 passed with 59 percent of the vote last month. Geoff Potter, who served as a spokesman for the pro-initiative campaign, said that the rally was 'a very loud, but very, very narrow and unrepresentative view of what the people of Washington have clearly demonstrated they want on background checks and gun laws.' At an I-594 'violation station' people posed with rifles that weren't theirs, and a wedding party unaffiliated with the protest that was taking pictures on the Capitol steps got into the spirit. Rally participant Brandon Lyons of Spanaway handed his AR-10 rifle to the groom, who posed with the rifle and his bride, then the best man held the firearm and mugged with the couple. The bride and groom, who were to be married later in Tacoma, wouldn't give their full names. 'We've all just broken the law,' Lyons said after they took pictures with the rifle. However, Washington State Patrol Trooper Guy Gill said 'we're not convinced that handing someone a gun is a violation of 594.' Gun rights advocates carrying their weapons walk past a young girl at a rally against Initiative 594 at the state capitol in Olympia, Washington . The law, which took effect Dec. 4, requires background checks on all sales and transfers, including private transactions and many loans and gifts. Opponents have taken most issue with the language surrounding transfers. I-594 defines a transfer as the delivery of a firearm 'without consideration of payment or promise of payment including, but not limited to, gifts and loans.' Exceptions include emergency gun transfers concerning personal safety, gifts between family members, antiques and loans for hunting. Capitol officials were preparing for up to 6,000 protesters, and Washington State Patrol troopers were seen on the periphery of the crowd. Taking aim: Jeff King (left) of Centralia, Washington points a rifle towards the state capitol. Initiative 594, which requires background checks for all gun purchases in Washington state, was voted into law last month . Demonstration: People hold signs as gun rights advocates rally against Initiative 594. The rule makes Washington the first state in the country to close the so-called gun-show loophole through popular vote . Gill said there are no plans to arrest people for exchanging guns or even selling weapons, but they could forward violations they see to prosecutors. 'Our Number 1 priority is to just make this a safe environment for people to express themselves,' he said. 'Most of these folks are responsible gun owners. We probably will not have an issue.' Norma Johnson of Enumclaw said the law isn't going to stop crime. 'You're targeting the wrong things by going after law-abiding citizens,' she said. Washington has joined six other states - California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, New York and Rhode Island, plus Washington, D.C. - in requiring universal background checks for all sales and transfers of all firearms, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. About a dozen other states have varying laws on expansion beyond what federal law requires .

"Peter Moores has insisted Alastair Cook is the right man to take England to the World Cup in February, while admitting it is ‘ridiculous’ to suggest no one is ‘unsackable’. As the tourists left Kandy’s hill-country this morning for Colombo and, on Tuesday, their final game of cricket in 2014, it was sobering to reflect that the same questions were swirling around Cook’s leadership when they played their first game of the year at Sydney back in January. The questions then concerned the Test job; now it is about the one-day position. Alastair Cook remains under pressure after another disappointing performance for England . Cook said his dropping of Sri Lanka's Kumar Sangakkara on 41 was a 'really costly drop' Cook takes the field for what would be a tough day at the office for the England captain in the sixth ODI . But the storyline has been a constant, and the England coach did his best to play down suggestions that there remained any doubt about Cook’s World Cup role. In that, he was not always successful. ‘It hasn’t changed,’ said Moores. ‘Alastair is announced as captain of our World Cup team. But I’ve said on every tour we go on, it will be wrong not to go back and look at everything that’s happened with the other selectors. ‘That’s the way it should be. It’s fair to the public that way. We’ll do exactly the same this time. But Alastair is our captain, and nothing has changed on that front for the moment.’ Confusion arose following an interview Moores gave to Ian Ward on Sky Sports after Saturday’s 90-run thrashing by Sri Lanka in Pallekele, a result that left England 4-2 down and with only pride to play for in Colombo. Moores told Ward that England would review ‘everything’ at the end of the series – a comment in which it was possible to read a lack of unequivocal support for his captain. This morning, it was still possible to read between the lines. ‘Alastair has said very clearly that he is very keen to carry on, and wants to remain as captain of England,’ said Moores. ‘He knows nobody has got the guarantee of that. I hear someone say no one’s unsackable. That would be a ridiculous comment. ‘We’ve got four selectors, and we always pick what we think is the best team – and that will be no different moving forward.’ Peter Moores insisted Cook is the right man to lead England at next year's World Cup . Sangakkara leaves the field in Kandy for the final time after spearheading Sri Lanka's 90-run ODI win . The keeper-batsman's team-mates ensure their veteran leads them off the field after clinching the series . It is more likely, amid the current climate of dissatisfaction at Cook’s batting and England’s one-day results, that Moores is simply trying to avoid being seen to rubber-stamp the future of a struggling captain. Talk of being ‘fair to the public’ feels like a bit of a sop: it is only eight days since Cook was confirmed as World Cup captain, and it would be an embarrassing admission of failure by the management to change their minds now. Moores may also be reluctant to pre-empt the discussion he will have after this is over with fellow selectors James Whitaker, Angus Fraser and Mick Newell. Whichever way you look at it, however, it seems inconceivable that Cook will not captain England in Australia and New Zealand, despite scoring a single half-century in his last 21 one-day internationals. And Moores was on firmer ground when he spoke of the progress made by others here in Sri Lanka. ‘We’ve had some real bonus performances by people – Moeen Ali at the top of the order, Joe Root played beautifully again – but we need to put the bowling, batting and fielding together at the same time. ‘We’ve got to get that right by the tri-series [against Australia and India] and, obviously, moving into that World Cup.’ Try as Moores might, though, the Cook question is likely to rumble on. Rarely can an England captain have approached the seventh match of a one-day series in such desperate need of a score. After putting down Sangakkara, who got 112, Cook was out LBW to Sachithra Senanayake for just one .","England captain Alastair Cook dropped Kumar Sangakkara on 41 .

"An anti-bloodsport campaigner and councillor has provoked fury by claiming that the suicide of a former soldier and game hunter was the ‘best use of a gun I can think of’. Thomas Woodward is facing calls to quit over the ‘outrageous’ remarks, which were posted on the Hunt Saboteurs Association’s Facebook page. The 48-year-old – a Liberal councillor on Ryedale District and Pickering Town councils in North Yorkshire – made the comments after reading reports about the death of Allan Ellis. Thomas Woodward is facing calls to quit by claiming that the suicide of former soldier and game hunter, Alan Ellis, above, was the ‘best use of a gun I can think of’ Mr Ellis, 50, a former Scots Guard from Bacup, Lancashire, shot himself in August after learning he was to be sued over a £40,000 debt. Mr Woodward wrote: ‘We would all rather live in a world where no one kills for fun. However, if you choose to own a gun and kill for pleasure, then it’s best you kill yourself.’ Richard Ali, of the British Association for Shooting and Conservation, said: ‘Mocking the suicide of anyone is absolutely unacceptable. Going further and stating that lawful gun owners should “kill themselves” is despicable behaviour. This man is not fit to hold a public office.’ Tim Bonner, of the Countryside Alliance, called the remarks ‘outrageous’ and added: ‘Mr Woodward should consider his position and those in authority in his party and council should consider disciplinary action.’ Mr Woodward, a builder who also runs a B&B with his wife Debbie at their Pickering home, said he did not need to apologise because ‘I did not say I was glad he killed himself’. He added the only risk to his position as a councillor was if he was voted off in an election.

"Parents are risking their children’s development by putting their entire families on restrictive diets, a new study has claimed. The Healthy Diet Study 2014, by Galaxy Research, has exposed the dangers of low carbohydrate and bread diets, which can restrict nutrients and vitamins needed for ideal psychological development. The study found that 82 per cent of parents give their children the same meals when they are on diets themselves, largely because it was more convenient than making separate meals. Scroll down for video . The Healthy Diet Study 2014 , led Galaxy Research, exposes the dangers of low carbohydrate and bread diets for children . The research found that a further 45 per cent of these parents limited the bread their children ate, and 17 per cent cut carbs from their children’s diet altogether. Popular diets such as paleo and clean-eating have seen a marked drop in carbohydrate intake among Australians, which can lead to a deficient intake of fibre, grains and protein. Sydney based paediatric dietician Hanan Salah told Daily Mail Australia she condemns restrictive low carbohydrate diets for children. ‘There are often overweight or obese parents who try to cut out food groups. In doing so, they put their children on these restrictive diets,’ she said. ‘Carbohydrates are essential to the brain function of children at school, as well as maintainingenergy levels. Carbohydrates also release serotonin, so restricting this can result in a drop in mood, and even the potential for depression in the long term.’ Ms Salah said that while the diets can lead to weight loss in overweight children, they will miss out on essential nutrients such as fibre and other vitamins. Dietician Hanan Salah said low carbohydrate diets can lead to a drop in serotonin and even the potential for depression in the long term . She recommends parents make smarter choices with regards to the portion and quality of food. ‘Rather than cutting out food groups, we recommend reducing portions for overweight families. Don’t worry about spending hours cooking complex meals. Opt for low GI carbohydrates such as brown rice and dark breads,' she said. ‘Ultimately carbohydrates are essential for children to thrive and be happy.’","The Healthy Diet Study 2014 exposes the risks of low carb diets for children .

"Dragons' Den star Duncan Bannatyne's financial director has been arrested as part of a probe into an alleged multi-million pound fraud at the entrepreneur's business. Christopher Paul Watson, 45, one of Mr Bannatyne's most trusted directors, was arrested on suspicion of fraud by abuse of position and later bailed. It came after employees of the Bannatyne Group, which runs hotels, spas and health centres across the country, alerted police investigating the fraud to a 'serious financial matter.' The financial director of Dragons' Den's Duncan Bannatyne (pictured) has been arrested on suspicion of defrauding the entrepreneur's multi-million pound business . In a ghost-written autobiography, Riding The Storm, the business mogul said Mr Watson was among his inner trusted circle and his 'senior team'. He describes Mr Watson as 'fantastic', saying that he helped negotiate the company out of a 'tight spot' during a difficult financial period. When describing the breakdown of his marriage to his second wife Joanne, Bannatyne also lists Mr Watson as one of the people who supported him through 'the most tumultuous two years of my life'. The book tells how Mr Watson helped the entrepreneur assess his options when it came to the divorce settlement. Companies House lists Mr Watson, a father-of-three, as both secretary and a director of Bannatyne Fitness Limited. It says he was appointed to the positions in February 2008 and December 2012 respectively. In his autobiography, Bannatyne (pictured left with the other so-called Dragons) described Christopher Watson as 'fantastic' and part of his inner trusted circle . A spokesman for Bannatyne's company, which is based in Darlington, said the investigation does not affect the day-to-day operation of the business. The company thanked police for their professionalism during the investigation so far. In a statement, the spokesman for Mr Bannatyne's company added: 'The police are investigating a serious financial matter reported to them by the Bannatyne Group. 'We are grateful for their thoroughness and professionalism. We have no comment to make except to say that it does not affect the current operation of our successful business.' The group did not comment on Mr Watson's current employment status. A spokesman for Durham Police said: 'We can confirm a 45-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of fraud by abuse of position.

Miliband refused to rule out a return to Westminster telling the Financial Times, 'You just don't know, do you?' 'Tony Blair and John Major have said that they wish they'd done their post-premiership jobs before they became prime minister,' he told the paper. The Labour leadership was contested by the Miliband brothers in 2010, and was eventually  won by  Ed. After losing out to his younger brother, Miliband spent some time as a Labour backbencher, before resigning as MP for South Shields and quitting the UK in 2013. His hint at a return to politics comes as the party is plagued by rumours of discontent surrounding his brother's ability to win the next General Election. Asked if he saw his IRC position as such a preparation for Number 10, Miliband said: 'That's not the way I conceived it. 'I miss my friends, my neighbourhood, my colleagues, obviously. But I am absolutely sure this is the right place for me and my family to be at this moment,' he said. 'I'm doing something that really speaks to my values and my passions.' He made a fresh appeal to pro-European forces in the UK to make the case more strongly but said he did not expect the British public would be so 'unbelievably stupid' to vote to leave the EU in a referendum. 'Those on the pro-British - as I call it - pro-European side of the argument have got to make the case that we get far more from being at the table than shouting with a loud hailer outside the room. 'I have this residual faith in the common sense of the British people that generally they don't do stupid things. And it would be unbelievably stupid to walk out of the European Union.'

"Authorities have revealed details surrounding the arrest of Sydney man Peter Gardner who is being held in a Chinese jail for alleged drug-smuggling. Gardner will find out his fate on Sunday - his 37th day in custody - whether or not he will be charged or released as this is the longest Chinese police can hold someone without an outcome. The 25-year-old was taken into custody along with Kalynda Davies, also from Sydney, who has since returned to Australia. Chinese authorities alleged they found 30kg of ice inside the luggage of Sydney man Peter Gardner . Gardner could face the death penalty by firing squad for allegedly attempting to traffic 30 kilograms of methamphetamine, also known as the drug ice. Guangzhou Customs claim they found the drugs in 60 vacuum-sealed bags inside Gardner's luggage while he was on his way to Sydney on Flight CZ325, the Sydney Morning Herald reported. His two pieces of hand luggage had to be forced open by authorities in an interrogation room in Baiyun Airport as the zippers were super glued. It is believed to be the most ice local customs have ever found leaving the country. The pair had only travelled to Guangzhou - in China's southern region - for three days and were on their way home November 8. They were stopped at security screening after checks revealed something unusual inside Gardner's bags. A month later, his companion - Ms Davis - was released without warning, with authorities later explaining there was no evidence that tied her to the alleged drug trafficking in a statement to Fairfax Media. 'There was no evidence that shows [Davis] had any subjective intention to take part in this drug trafficking crime,' Guangzhou Customs said. Kalynda Davis, 22, (pictured left with her father, Larry) was arrested along with Mr Gardner but has since been released. After her return to Australia, family and friends were seen visiting the family home (right) These details emerge as the father of Gardner said he did not know if his son was innocent. Russell Gardner told The Daily Telegraph his son was 'doing okay' while in prison. The woman who was with Gardner at the time of his arrest was Kalynda Davis. She was also taken into custody but was released and returned to her relieved family in Sydney last Tuesday after spending a month in a cramped Chinese prison cell. But Peter Gardner, who she met on Tinder just weeks before travelling to China, remains locked-up in Guangzhou. 'I don’t know if he's innocent. She obviously was innocent because the police wouldn't have let her go if they couldn't pin it on her,' Gardner's father told the Telegraph. 'There’s probably more to the story but the embassy know and the lawyers know.' Mr Gardner said his son, who had never been in serious trouble  before, had not been allowed to make any contact with  his anxious family, except for sending a couple of letters. Welcome home: Friends of Kalynda Davis arrived at the family's home in Glenmore Park to welcome Kalynda home with flowers . Despite this, and the threat of the death penalty, he said Chinese police were treating his son 'okay'. 'I’ve got over that initial shock you get at first, but you’ve got to take it as it comes. We’re managing, we’re pulling together. We’re still a close family, the Chinese are treating him okay,' he said. Peter Gardner, a New Zealand national, had been living in Richmond in Sydney's north-western suburbs after completing his apprenticeship at a western Sydney construction firm. Russell said the accusation his son had been carrying methamphetamine did not make any sense. He said he had hired a Chinese lawyer and the family were nervously waiting on the findings of  the Chinese investigators. A former friend told Fairfax Media Gardner was a 'great guy' who was 'very caring, nice and softly spoken'. 'I guess he just got tangled up in a bad way of life. Every time I talked to him he was always genuine and never seemed like he would get involved in that,' the Richmond High School alumni said. While Gardner remained in jail, his travel companion, Kalynda Davis, touched down in Sydney last Tuesday. Family and friends of the 22-year-old were seen coming in and out of her home in the days following her homecoming. Friends of Kalynda Davis in Sydney have told media 'she's doing fine.' 'She's great, she's innocent, she's fine,' a friend said outside the family home. Daily Mail Australia understands Ms Davis will catch up with some of her friends in private over the weekend. Kalynda Davis's (pictured) friends say they have constantly believed that her truth was always going to come out . Ms Davis met Gardner just weeks before they took a spontaneous trip to China together . Kalynda Davis’ anguished father said he ‘just collapsed’ as soon as his little girl returned home after an ordeal he described as 'a parent's worst nightmare and multiply it by ten'. ‘I knew she was so innocent. I prayed every night that the truth would come out… We found out that she was being released on Friday [December 5] night,' former policeman Larry Davies told The Western Weekender. ‘We cried and cried and cried and cried and I don’t think I had more than four hours sleep after that until last night, when she was home safely.' Ms Davis quickly found herself in a living hell after starting out on what was meant to be a fun spontaneous trip with Gardner who she met on Tinder two weeks before. Ms Davis later told her father: 'I'm sorry dad, I didn't do it, I didn't do it, I didn't do it'. The Glenmore Park resident's long blonde hair was cut into a short bob while she was locked up in the detention centre. She was kept in a small holding area, ‘with a small area to sleep and that’s it’, but her family last week praised the Chinese authorities for being very respectful in their treatment of Kalynda. Kalynda Davis was driven away from the family home by her father to escape the hype and attention just a day after she arrived home last week . A friend of Kalynda Davis arrives at the Glenmore Park house in western Sydney with a gift for the 22-year-old . The relatives of Kalynda Davis (pictured) arrived at her house in Glenmore Park in western Sydney last Tuesday . When friends of Ms Davis heard of her return, all they could express was relief. 'SHES HOME!! BIGGEST SMILE EVER!,' close friend Dan Stella wrote on his Facebook page. 'The last month has been a daily struggle but today I sit here with tears of happiness. 'I can't even concentrate, drivin' off the road and s**t haha. ""So happy!"" Every day we have something to be thankful for! 'Today is kal is home safe and well with love ones. See you soon, always had ya back, always will... so glad your ok ""best day of my f**king life...... love ya kal"".' Sydney man Dan Stella (above, left) has posted on Instagram (above) about his 'tears of happiness' at the safe return of his dear friend Kalynda Davis (right, next to Stella) Kalynda Davis returned to her family’s double-storey brick home in Glenmore Park (pictured) in Sydney’s outer west . A school friend told Daily Mail Australia the Davis family would be delighted to have Kalynda home for Christmas. 'This is amazing news. Especially for her family, they must be so happy to have her home for Christmas and I'm so happy for them all and ecstatic to hear she's home,' they said. Kalynda's friend of more than a decade, Blake Tatafu, 22, told Daily Mail Australia he was overjoyed at his good mate's release. 'I don't think there's actually words to describe [how I'm feeling]', Mr Tatafu said. 'It just proves that the truth will set you free.' A family liaison officer- DFAT's Claire Went - was sent from Canberra to China to support the Davis family, who said in a statement they would not have made it through without her. 'Without the support of Ms Went we would not have been able to get through this difficult time', they said. Asked if he was delighted Kalynda was home safe, John, a visiting elderly relative told Daily Mail Australia: ‘Of course we are.' Ms Davis (pictured) has returned home after being detained for a month in a Chinese prison after she had her long-blonde hair cut into a bob . Her family have always said she was innocent in the entire incident, which saw her facing a possible death penalty . Following their daughter's return, Kaylnda's parents - father Larry and mother Jennifer - told reporters they were pleased and relieved Kalynda was free and safe following her month-long ordeal in Guangzhou. In a statement, they said: 'We are happy to have Kalynda back home. We have always known Kalynda to be innocent of these allegations.' 'Her return home today is a clear statement of her innocence. 'We have received so much support from family and friends. We thank everyone for the support we have received during the last month.' Do you know more?

"Two former police officers are being investigated over claims they sexually abused a former child actor at a guesthouse allegedly frequented by VIPs and politicians, The Mail on Sunday can reveal. Lee Towsey claims two undercover officers, who were themselves investigating abuse claims, sexually assaulted him at the Elm Guest House in South-West London. The guesthouse is at the centre of a police investigation looking into allegations that young boys were abused by Westminster politicians, judges, pop stars and a member of the Royal household. Scroll down for video . Two former police officers are being investigated over claims they sexually abused a former child actor at the Elm Guest House in South-West London, above, which was frequented by VIPs and politicians . Earlier this month, Home Secretary Theresa May described claims that MPs murdered and abused children at an exclusive block of flats as ‘the tip of the iceberg’ The new revelation comes amid a flood of serious allegations, including that police covered up the name of an MP who abused a child at the former guesthouse. Earlier this month, Home Secretary Theresa May described claims that MPs murdered and abused children at an exclusive block of flats as ‘the tip of the iceberg’. In an interview with The Mail on Sunday in April, Mr Towsey said he had sex with two officers who were gaining intelligence on the guesthouse prior to the June 1982 raid. Mr Towsey worked as a masseur at the guesthouse but was 16 at the time of the offences, which was under the age of homosexual consent then. He said: ‘The first came in April and I had sex with him. ‘He turned out to be one of the officers who later raided the house. ‘He came back about three weeks later and hired a room. He stayed two nights and on the second night his partner stayed too. ‘I ended up having sex with them. Afterwards they asked me “how much” and I told them that they were not clients and I felt insulted they wanted to pay me.’ Mr Towsey, who appeared in Grange Hill and Doctor Who, was taken to Richmond police station after the raid, where, he claims, he saw the second officer. Metropolitan Police detectives launched the investigation after Mr Towsey reported the allegations to police in early 2013. It referred the matter the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC), but the watchdog decided not to investigate and sent the case back to the Met. The Met’s Directorate of Professional Standards is now leading the investigation, Operation Yvonne, into the former officers, who were police constables at the time of the alleged offence. Scotland Yard has refused to release their names. After the raid the guesthouse owners, Harry and Carole Kasir, were convicted of keeping a disorderly house and having obscene videos. They were given a two-year suspended sentence and fined £1,000. Ordeal: How The Mail on Sunday revealed in April that Lee Towsey had been abused as a teenager by police officers at the Elm Guest house . Mr Towsey’s lawyer said police had now asked his client to provide a further statement about the claims. Nigel Fisher, of Fletcher Day solicitors, said: ‘We are pleased police have now officially launched an investigation into the events. ‘It is an important step in taking Lee’s case further. Police have asked Lee to give a further statement which he is doing in the next couple of weeks.’ Operation Yvonne is the latest off-shoot from Operation Fernbridge, which is looking into claims children were abused at the former guest house, which is now a row of flats.Police have already confirmed the disgraced former Liberal MP Sir Cyril Smith, who Mr Towsey said was one of his clients, was a visitor. Police are probing allegations VIPs preyed on boys who were brought to the guesthouse in Rocks Lane, Barnes, from a nearby children’s home. It has also been suggested that police or security services covered up the name of a politician who allegedly abused a child taken into custody the night of the raid. A social worker who was at the police station claimed details of the boy’s account were left out of his police statement. The social worker said that the boy had spoken of a man called ‘Uncle XXXXX’ and that the man worked ‘at the big houses’ – the Houses of Parliament. However references to both ‘Uncle XXXXX’ and the Houses of Parliament were left out of what should have been a verbatim account of his statement. Simon Danczuk MP, who spoke to Mr Towsey after it emerged that Cyril Smith was a regular visitor to the guesthouse, said: ‘These latest allegations are very worrying and suggest that the awful experiences young lads had to endure there were compounded by a botched police investigation. ‘If we’re going to uncover the truth of what happened at Elm Guest House it’s vital that the role of the police in investigating these criminal activities is examined thoroughly.’ As well as Operation Fernbridge, the Met has a number of active investigations into VIP-related child abuse ongoing. Operation Fairbank is looking into claims a paedophile ring had links to Westminster, while Operation Midland is looking into explosive claims boys were abused and even killed by Conservative politicians at Dolphin Square, a block of flats in Pimlico, London. The Home Office, which came under fire for losing a dossier of alleged abuses given by Geoffrey Dickens to former Home Secretary Leon Brittan in 1983, is conducting a public inquiry into historic abuse. A Met police spokesman said: ‘We can confirm that allegations of historical sexual abuse against two former officers, alleged to have taken place in the 1980s, were passed to the IPCC for its consideration. It referred the matter back to the Met for local department of professional standards investigation.’ A spokesman for the IPCC said a senior investigator assessed the available information and decided the force should continue with its own investigation. The spokesman said: ‘We asked the force to refer the matter again if any evidence was found that may merit this decision being reconsidered.’ ... and new probe launched into child sex abuse at Jonathan King disco . A police probe into a celebrity paedophile ring, which led to the convictions of pop mogul Jonathan King and DJ Chris Denning, has been sensationally reopened, the Mail on Sunday can reveal. An independent report into Surrey Police’s high-profile investigation into the Walton Hop disco has found the original operation did not fully explore all lines of inquiry. Convicted: Walton Hop DJ Jonathan King; but police are now looking at what may have been missed during their original investigation . Surrey’s Operation Arundel, which ran for six years from 2000, centred on the disco in Walton-on-Thames, Surrey where King and Chris Denning picked up victims in the 1970s and 80s . Surrey’s Operation Arundel, which ran for six years from 2000, centred on the disco in Walton-on-Thames, Surrey where King and Denning picked up victims in the 1970s and 80s. Visitors to the disco are understood to have included a string of celebrities – including pop stars and famous TV personalities. King, 70, ex-Radio 1 star Chris Denning, 73, and Robert Randall, a DJ at the disco, were prosecuted. Several well-known figures were arrested but not charged, including TV presenter Matthew Kelly and former Bay City Rollers manager Tam Paton. Now it can be revealed that an independent report by Merseyside Police to ‘establish whether there were any further investigative lines of enquiry’ identified a number of actions, which Surrey Police said they ‘are now progressing’. The new operation, codenamed Ravine, will draw on information from the Metropolitan Police’s Operation Yewtree. Last month, Yewtree detectives secured the conviction of Denning on 40 charges against boys aged from nine to 16 in the 1970s and 1980s. He is due to be sentenced next week. No arrests have been made and police have asked anyone with information to come forward.","Lee Towsey claims the officers abused him at the South-West guesthouse .

"Ms Mantel's story depicts the murder of former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher (pictured) at the hands of an IRA gunman . The BBC provoked fury last night over its plans to broadcast a ‘sick’ story imagining the assassination of Margaret Thatcher. The fantasy, by bestselling author Hilary Mantel, was condemned as ‘perverted’ and ‘distasteful’ when it was published in September. Now The Mail on Sunday can reveal that Radio 4 has selected the story for its prestigious Book At Bedtime slot – sparking a furious backlash. Supporters of the former Prime Minister accused the broadcaster of being deliberately provocative with a move that will stoke accusations of BBC bias against the Tories. ‘It is a sick book from a sick mind and it’s being promoted by a sick broadcasting corporation,’ former Cabinet Minister Lord Tebbit said. Ms Mantel’s story depicts the callous murder of the former Prime Minister by an IRA gunman and was inspired by the Booker Prize-winning author’s own fantasy about assassinating Lady Thatcher, who she admits to ‘detesting’. The broadcast on January 9 will increase tensions between the BBC and the Government after David Cameron and George Osborne accused the Corporation of bias in its coverage of spending cuts. The Assassination Of Margaret Thatcher will be read by Shakespearean actress Dame Harriet Walter in a 13-minute broadcast understood to have been commissioned by Caroline Raphael, the executive responsible for comedy and fiction on Radio 4. Last year Ms Raphael came under fire after critics claimed there was overt Left-wing bias in the station’s comedy programmes. Lord Tebbit – whose wife Margaret was paralysed when the IRA tried to murder Margaret Thatcher and her Cabinet in the 1984 Brighton bombing – called on the BBC’s director-general to stop the broadcast. He said: ‘The serialisation should never have gone ahead and, if Tony Hall was worth his gigantic salary, he would stop it. It would be interesting to know how much the BBC had paid for the book.’ The Corporation declined to reveal that figure. Lord Bell a former adviser and friend of Lady Thatcher also criticised the decision . He said: ‘If the BBC had any real sensibility it would leave that subject alone with an Election just five months away. It is inevitably going to be accused of political bias. If it really was independent it would avoid doing things that were provocative.’ Tory MP Conor Burns, Lady Thatcher’s closest confidant and adviser in her final days, added: ‘Given the public controversy that surrounded Hilary Mantel’s original publication of this twisted little story from her disordered mind it seems calculating of the BBC to choose it for Book at Bedtime.’ He added: ‘Leaving aside the distastefulness, it certainly seems to me to be an unfortunate choice for people who are on the verge of a restful night’s sleep.’ The BBC's decision to select Hilary Mantel's (pictured) story for its prestigious Book At Bedtime slot has sparked a furious backlash . Ms Mantel – who was unavailable to comment on the BBC’s impending broadcast – has previously spoken of her assassination fantasy, saying she was once so close to the Prime Minister she could have pulled the trigger herself, saying: ‘If I was someone else she’d be dead.’ Her story features a middle-class housewife who unwittingly lets an IRA hitman into her home and then becomes complicit in the murder. The two characters make no secret of their hatred of the former Prime Minister who is criticised for her ‘fake femininity’, ‘her counterfeit voice’ and her ‘philistinism’. The story ends with the terrorist taking aim at the Prime Minister and remarking: ‘Rejoice, F****** rejoice’ – a crude echo of comments made by Mrs Thatcher when she was announcing British victories during the Falklands War of 1982. Its publication provoked a huge political row in September and the Tory-supporting Daily Telegraph cancelled plans to serialise the story for fear it would offend its readers. The book caused outrage when it was published in September, with critics calling it 'perverted' and 'distasteful' Even readers of the Left-wing Guardian newspaper, which did publish the story, found it distasteful. One complained: ‘Thatcher was in very many ways a disaster but she deserves better than this.’ Another wrote: ‘Disgusting – so easy to use Thatcher to get attention... It’s lazy writing... Hilary Mantel should be ashamed of herself.’ The controversial assassination plot is one of ten short stories in an anthology of Mantel’s work, also called The Assassination of Margaret Thatcher. The BBC which plans to serialise four of the stories across five days beginning on January 5 describes the collection as ‘wickedly witty and mischievous’ in publicity material. Ms Mantel, whose Booker Prize winning novel Wolf Hall has just been adapted by BBC Two, has made no secret of her dislike for Mrs Thatcher. Shortly after the publication of the anthology she described the Prime Minister as ‘anti feminist’ and a ‘psychological transvestite’. She said: ‘When I think of her I can still feel that boiling detestation. She did long-standing damage in many areas of national life.’ Ms Mantel also accused Lady Thatcher of acting too much like a man. She said: ‘There has to be a model for women in public life that is not generated out of a male model. We had... Mrs Thatcher in a mythological guise of Britannia wearing her breast plate and having a good war to prove herself more masculine than the men.’ Ms Mantel sparked another controversy last year when she said the Duchess of Cambridge was a ‘shop-window mannequin’ whose only purpose was to breed. She later said her comments had been taken out of context but did not deny saying them. A spokeswoman for the BBC last night confirmed it would be serialising the book, including the controversial story about the plot to kill Mrs Thatcher. She said: ‘Book at Bedtime offers the best of modern and classic literature and, in doing so, presents a wide range of perspectives from around the world. ‘The work of Hilary Mantel – a double Booker Prize-winning author – is of significant interest to the public and we will not shy away from the controversial subject matter that features in one of the four stories read across the week.’","Radio 4 has selected the book for its prestigious Book at Bedtime slot .

"The hottest property in the hardest game today is the young man from Bolton, England who was the poster boy for British Olympics ten years ago. Amir Khan out-shone the neon glare of the fabled Las Vegas Strip on Saturday night. So brilliantly did he bedazzle the much-respected three-time world champion Devon Alexander that this neon city which craves thrills and excitement is clamouring to see his name back in lights here soon. VIDEO Scroll down for Amir Khan: Hype about my chin is b******* . Amir Khan (left) throws a punch on his way to victory against Devon Alexander in Las Vegas on Saturday . Khan never looked in trouble and kept Alexander on the back foot with a punches in bunches . Khan celebrated at the final bell but Alexander knew he was a beaten man after the 12 rounds . The billion dollar question is whether the next time his fresh face appears on those giant electronic screens it will be alongside the glowering features of Floyd Mayweather. There was no dissenting, not even by the most chauvinistic Americans, that the statement Khan delivered, as promised, was powerful enough to merit a mega-fight with the pound-for-pound king of the ring next year. Even without the exclamation mark of a knock-out. Khan’s up-and-down journey from a silver medal in Athens to a performance in Vegas as golden as those preposterous shorts he wore in the MGM Grand Garden has burnished a new crown jewel in British boxing. The time has come for the nation to unite behind his utterly valid claim for a shot at ultimate glory. Britain has been radically divided in its feelings about this warrior for Anglo-Islamic relations. For those who have doubted or resented him, now is the moment to relent. Amir Khan, in the week of his 28th birthday, has grown into a cause for patriotic celebration. He has catapulted himself into the elite company of Floyd Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao at the summit of the most talent-packed division in boxing. To be a welterweight at this point in fistic history is to be confronted by a veritable host of world-class fighters, if they will meet your challenge. That has to be put to Mayweather if he retracts this weekend’s promise to give Pacquiao and the world the mega-fight after which they have been hungering for years. If he is not the first alternate for Mayweather’s next fight, then Khan must assume that his performance damaged his own chances as drastically as it hurt Alexander’s fighting pride. Khan lands a left hand square on Alexander's chin on his way to a dominant performance . Khan's speed was once again his biggest asset as he left the former world champion dazed and confused . Alexander lands a rare shot on Khan during a fight he struggled to show his attacking prowess . Khan and Alexander go head to head early in the fight but only one man would go on to take control . Mayweather reneged on a promise made a year ago to engage with Khan, whose legendary promoter Oscar De La Hoya said: ‘Now I can understand why Floyd doesn’t want to fight Amir. I wouldn’t have wanted to fight him after watching this.’ In unison with the other 7,767 in the arena, De La Hoya was on his feet not only cheering Khan but standing to applaud a virtuoso with his talents in full artistic flow. The speed has always been phenomenal. Now the ring-craft has been perfected by long hours in the gym with his latest trainer, Virgil Hunter. The balance – not only of feet and movement but in understanding when to attack without unnecessary risk – has been drilled into the completion of the gladiator package. De La Hoya said: ‘Not only did he win virtually every round against a highly technical southpaw boxer – which is very complicated to achieve – but he showed why he would be big trouble for Floyd.’ For the record I gave Alexander only a sympathetic share of the eighth round, his best and in which he managed to land three or four solid left hooks. That was the one occasion Khan wavered from the game plan devised by Hunter, who said: ‘ He was great and he corrected that mistake almost at once but it marks him down to 9.9 out of ten for briefly losing focus.’ Alexander was berated in his corner but the truth was he had no solution to the puzzle posed by Khan . Khan lands a right hand on Alexander (left) and celebrates with promoter Oscar de la Hoya (right) Time and time again, Khan was first with the jab as he opened up a healthy lead over Alexander . Khan showed a new-found patience as he timed his shots to perfection to bewilder Alexander . Khan pictured at the post fight press conference after his emphatic win over Alexander in Las Vegas . DAVID HAYE: As predicted, an amazing, disciplined and punch perfect performance by Amir Khan against a world class fighter. CARL FROCH: Really easy win for Khan, not many expected such a one sided whooping! Well done kid. RIO FERDINAND: Well done @AmirKingKhan on a polished mature schooling of Alexander! Whos next???? MICHAEL OWEN: Great win for @AmirKingKhan earlier this morning. Top class, let's hope he goes on to unify the division. The three official judgements varied narrowly either side of my 120-109 score-card. Alexander was beaten beyond a quibble, saying: ‘I couldn’t get my punches off. I couldn’t land on him. I couldn’t do all the things we had worked on in training camp. He is very fast.’ So quick that when he really accelerated into lightning combinations from all angles the punches were a blur in the eyes of those at ringside. Alexander did not detect them at all until they thundered against each side of his head. All that prevented a stoppage was Alexander’s courageous willingness to keep taking those blows – and the embarrassment to himself that came with them. Alexander was previously a two-weight world champion but Khan made him look ordinary in Las Vegas . Khan lands a right hand on the button as the Brit showed why he is one of the best in the world . Khan celebrates his victory which earned him the WBC Silver welterweight title (right) Fundamental to Hunter’s blueprint was the left hook off Khan’s jab, over Alexander’s right lead. Such was the precision as well as speed of Khan’s punching that those hooks landed with what must have been sickening monotony. There were Khan converts all around the Grand Garden. They believed when he said: ‘I’m getting better as I get older. And wiser. And my best years are still ahead of me'. Suddenly, those of us who have been saying for some time that he has real chance of inflicting Mayweather’s first defeat found allies in abundance. Whisper it, please, in case Mr Money is eves-dropping. If Mayweather was watching, as he said he would, he will have had plenty of food for thought as he went off to his favourite burger bar on the Strip. King Khan is on his way to greatness. All aboard the roller-coaster – even the naysayers who have been reluctant to forgive him being stopped by Danny Garcia – ‘I’d love to avenge that defeat if I get the chance’ - and who still want to see Kell Brook knock him out, if that fight happens in Britain. Love him or not,the tickets are worth every dime. Because with this young man it is a ride with never a dull moment.","Amir Khan was a class above Devon Alexander with a dominant showing .

"Defence Secretary Michael Fallon has announced hundreds of British troops will be sent to Iraq in a bid to step up the battle against ISIS . Hundreds of British troops are to be sent to Iraq next month to train locals forces in a bid to step up the battle against Islamic State extremists. Defence Secretary Michael Fallon said details of the contribution to an international mission were still being finalised, but the additional deployment numbered 'in the low hundreds'. Mr Fallon said a small protection contingent of combat-ready British soldiers would be sent to four US-led 'safe' centres. The move represents a significant swelling of the 50-strong British force presently engaged in preparing Iraqi and Kurdish fighters for a new phase of the fight to retake swathes of territory seized by the jihadis. RAF planes have been heavily involved for several months in air strikes and reconnaissance missions across Iraq which have forced IS fighters to switch tactics and lay low in towns and villages - requiring a ground offensive, Mr Fallon told the Telegraph. But with international allies unwilling to countenance a return to 'boots on the ground', the focus is on ensuring local forces are sufficiently trained and equipped to mount an effective offensive against the extremists. A big element of the UK contribution will be passing on the experience gained during the 13-year war with the Taliban in Afghanistan in dealing with roadside bombs and other explosive devices, Mr Fallon added. 'Our role now, apart from the air strikes, is increasingly going to be on training,' he said. 'In particular, it will mean dealing with car and truck bombs and roadside devices, as well as basic infantry skills. 'We have not finalised numbers yet - obviously we have got a lot of kit back from Afghanistan that we can make available - but we are talking very low hundreds.' ISIS fighters were 'increasingly tucked away in towns and villages' as a result of the air strikes, he said. 'That means they have got to be rooted out by ground troops. This has to be done by an own-grown army, not by western groups.' He stressed that the training centres - one in Kurdistan and three near the Iraqi capital Baghdad - were 'not where the fighting is'. 'They are in safe areas but obviously there's always a small element of force protection.' Islamic State controls large parts of Iraq and neighbouring Syria where they are waging war with the aim of establishing an Islamic caliphate. Britain joined air strikes in September and has flown a 'huge number', Mr Fallon said - 'second only to the United States, five times as many as France'. The move signals a significant swelling of the 50-strong British force presently engaged in preparing Iraqi and Kurdish fighters in the battle to retake swathes of territory seized by ISIS .","Defence Secretary Michael Fallon announced additional deployment .

"Brittany Killgore, 22, was tortured and murdered for refusing to participate in bondage sex games . Prosecutors in California won't seek the death penalty for the three people facing trial for the brutal slaying of a Marine wife two years ago. The suspects in the rape, torture and murder of 22-year-old Brittany Killgore will instead face life in prison if they're convicted on first-degree murder charges, U-T San Diego reported. The San Diego District Attorney's Office didn't reveal why it wouldn't try to put them to death. The trio — Louis Perez, 48, Dorothy Maraglino, 39 and Jessica Lopez, 27 — are expected to face trial on June 1 over the 2012 disappearance of Killgore, whose Marine husband was in Afghanistan at the time of the slaying. They are also charged with conspiracy, kidnapping and torture. Prosecutors charge Killgore, met the trio when she and a friend went to a home in Fallbrook, north of San Diego, to buy an item being sold online. Killgore, whose husband was a Camp Pendleton Marine, turned down Perez's offer. But later in the day, sent him a text message asking if she knew anyone who could help her move. Prosecutors say 48-year-old Louis Perez, a former Camp Pendleton Marine sergeant, was the 'sex master' in the trio whose 'unusual sexual fetishes' led them to kidnap, rape and murder Killgore in 2012 . Dorothy Maraglino (left), 39, and Jessica Lopez (right), 27, are also facing first-degree murder and a slew of other violent charges stemming from Killgore's death. Prosecutors won't seek the death penalty for the three . 'Party with me tonight & you’ll have five guys there in the morning,' replied Perez, a Camp Pendleton Marine sergeant. It is unclear if Killgore took him up on the offer, but prosecutors Perez and his accomplices kidnapped Killgore and made her an unwilling participant in bondage and torture. She was then strangled and her nude body left in a ditch near Lake Skinner in Riverside County. Witness testimony later revealed that Perez, Maraglino and Lopez  lived together in the house where Killgore was killed, where they participated in an alternative lifestyle that included bondage and sadomasochism. Killgore's husband, Lance Cpl Cory Killgore (left), was posted in Afghanistan when his wife disappeared . A detective said the trio may have targeted Killgore for 'unusual sexual fetishes.' Police seized from the house whips, sex toys, rope and pulleys, a document titled 'Slave Rules,' duct tape, a stun baton and other bondage instruments from the house. Killgore's last communication was a desperate text message to a friend the night of her murder: 'Help' Investigators found Killgore's blood and hair on several of the items . Investigators said they believe all three were with Killgore at the home shortly after she apparently sent a desperate text message to a friend that simply said: 'Help.' Perez was arrested in April 2012 on suspicion of possessing a stolen assault rifle and was later charged with murder. That same month, Lopez was arrested at a San Diego hotel where she was discovered with self-inflicted cuts. They also found a letter in which Lopez allegedly claimed that she killed Killgore out of fear that the woman would steal away Perez, whom she described as her 'master.' Lopez said she tried to chop up Killgore's body with power tools before dumping it near the lake, but the body was found hours later. The letter also contended that Perez and Maraglino weren't responsible for the killing. However, prosecutors said both were involved. Killgore was last seen April 13, 2012, in a borrowed purple evening gown, three days after she filed for divorce from Lance Cpl Cory Killgore. Cory Killgore, who returned from Afghanistan after hearing of his wife's disappearance, was cleared of any involvement in her death. Killgore's Marine husband, Cory, returned from Afghanistan when he heard about his  wife's disappearance .","Marine wife Brittany Killgore, 22, was found naked and dismembered in a ditch near San Diego, California, in 2012 .

"One of the brothers behind Britain's first cereal café has written an open letter to Channel 4 complaining about an excruciating interview which made a 'mockery' of him. Gary Keely, who founded Cereal Killer Cafe with his twin brother Alan, was challenged over selling bowls for £3.20 in one of the most deprived areas of London. The hipster seemed to be caught unaware by Symeon Brown's questions and even claimed that the niche cafe, which opened earlier in Tower Hamlets this week, was 'cheap'. But he has now responded by saying the interview was 'completely unfair' and said the journalist did not even pay for his bowl, despite the fact he was wearing an 'overpriced River Island suit'. Gary Keely (above), who founded Cereal Killer Cafe with his twin brother Alan, has written an open letter to Channel 4 after a 'completely unfair' interview . The cafe-owner (left in white) said that his prices were 'cheap' for the area when questioned by Symeon Brown from Channel 4 (right) He also jokingly pointed out he was not the man to solve the property crisis in London as he was 'too busy trying to cure Ebola and getting Kim Kardashian to keep her clothes on'. 'First of all you tried to blame me for the property prices in London before attacking me with questions about poverty,' he wrote on the café's Facebook page. 'I am a small business owner and am gambling everything I have in this business and you try to make a mockery out of me. 'I have a million things going on in my head and one of those things was about helping local charities as I am not the selfish **** you have made me out to be. 'You obviously don't understand business if you think I don't have to put a mark-up on what I sell.' He said the journalist did not even pay for his bowl, despite the fact he was wearing an 'overpriced River Island suit' He said he has to pay 'over the top rent' as well as paying his 12 staff, so he either has to make a profit or run out of business. 'Maybe if I charged over £3 for a coffee and dodged all the taxes in this country like some cafés - the reporters would leave me alone would they,' he said. The brothers, from Belfast, opened their venture earlier this week on Brick Lane - a hipster hotspot and home to a number of quirky cafes. After tasting one of the 120 varieties on offer, priced at £3.20, Mr Brown asked the cafe owner whether he thought it was a lot to charge for a bowl. The restaurateur seemed surprised by the question and responded saying, 'I think it is quite cheap for the area'. He was challenged by the interviewer, who pointed out that the cafe is in one of the poorest parts of London - and asked again whether £3 seemed like a premium price. Mr Keely tried to justify the extraordinary cost and explained that many of the brands are 'imported from America'. The journalist then asked what this means for the people who live in the area, where the proportion of children living in poverty has nearly reached 50 per cent. Hipster: The Cereal Killer cafe was founded by identical twins Alan (right) and Gary Keely from Belfast . Mr Keely responded saying, 'Well, if they are poor, probably not then.' The cafe owner then became defensive and started asking to stop the interview because 'he doesn't like the questions'. In his open letter, Mr Keely said he would be sending the journalist the bill from his unpaid cereal, signing it from 'the worst person in the world'. He also brought up the fact that he was brought up in one of the most deprived areas in Belfast. 'My family know all about poverty but haven't had to blame the small business owners in the area for it, I have been taught a great work ethic and have made it this far without blaming small business owners trying to better themselves and make a future for themselves.' Niches: Along with 120 varieties of cereal, the restaurant also offers 20 toppings and 12 different milk options . Deprived: The cafe, pictured above, is in Tower Hamlets, where one in two children live in poverty . The café plays on nostalgia, with limited-edition boxes and collectibles proudly displayed on furniture reminiscent of yesteryear. They also employ a 'mixologist' - who combines different types of cereal for customers looking for something different. The cafe is open from 7am until 10pm and serves breakfast, lunch and dinner - meaning cereal aficionados can get their fix pretty much any time of day. Behind the counter, brightly-coloured boxes line the walls and offerings are as diverse as Golden Grahams and Reese's Puffs to Cap'n Crunch and Apple Jacks. When asked about his favourite cereal, Mr Keeley said: 'I really love the Boo-berry, Count Chocula and Franken-berry – these are limited-edition Halloween cereals that are only available one month of the year in America. 'We've got these, but really limited-edition, so we've only got about 20 boxes of them.' Channel 4 News and Symeon Brown were not available for a comment when contacted. Imported: Mr Keely says that the reason the cereals cost so much is because some are American brands . Located in east London, Tower Hamlets has the highest rate of child poverty in the country - it reached 49 per cent this year, up from 42 per cent last year. It also has the second highest unemployment rate in London. Every ward has a higher proportion of people claiming out of work benefits than the London average. But the problems are by no means confined to the economic - Tower Hamlets also has very high rates of long term illness and premature death. Yet this is only half the picture. Tower Hamlets also has some of the highest paid people in London, working in the financial district of Canary Wharf, which has European headquarters for HSBC, Citibank and Barclays. The proportion of jobs in Tower Hamlets that are low paid is one of the smallest in the capital. The borough also boasts booming Brick Lane, which lies at the centre of Britain's hipster culture and is home to a number of quirky bars and restaurants. At a number of these establishments, including the Cereal Killer Cafe, customers can expect to pay a premium for the out-of-the-ordinary experiences. Just down the road from Cereal Killer Cafe is Lady Dinah's Cat Emporium. There, visitors pay £5 to book a table in the cafe, which is home to a number of rescue cats.","Cereal Killer Cafe sells 120 varieties of cereal and a  bowl costs £3.20 .

"A widow whose western . Pennsylvania home was sold by the county after she failed to pay . interest accrued on $6.30 in late tax fees was overjoyed when a . court ruled she can keep her home, her lawyer said on Friday. Eileen Battisti, who is in her early 50s and lost her . husband in 2004, was unfamiliar with managing her finances and . did not understand in 2009 that she owed the $6.30 late fee. It subsequently accrued $234.72 in interest, prompting the . tax sale of her home in 2011, said her lawyer, Ed Santillan. A judge in Pittsburgh on Thursday ruled Battisti could keep . ownership of the home in Aliquippa, about 20 miles (32 km) northwest of Pittsburgh. Eileen Battisti was unsure how to run her family's finances after the death of her husband in 2004, meaning a late tax bill of $6.30 led to the sale of her home. A judge in Pennsylvania has now overturned the decision . Mrs Battisti has been staying in the property, worth $280,000, with two of her adult children during the court proceedings and will not be forced to leave . She has remained in the home with two of her three adult . children since it was sold by the Beaver County Tax Claim Bureau . to S.P. Lewis, a man who buys tax delinquent properties and . sells them back to their former owners for a profit, according . to court papers. 'We are thrilled with the decision of the commonwealth court . and my client cried tears of joy when she heard the news,' Santillan said. 'I think when you read the opinion it is clear that the . property should never have been sold,' he added. Pennsylvania Commonwealth Court Judge Mary Leavitt ruled . that county tax officials failed to provide Battisti with proper . notification or warning regarding the sale of her house. 'A reasonable tax claim bureau would have responded to . Taxpayer's payment on the 2008 taxes with an invoice for $6.30, . and it would have invoiced Taxpayer in 2010 for the 2009 . shortage of $234.72,' the judge wrote in her ruling. The home, which is worth between $250,000 and $280,000, was . sold to Lewis for $113,000. He offered to sell the property back . to Battisti for $160,000, Santillan said. Lewis did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The bureau still has the money from the sale and is expectedto return it to Lewis, Santillan said, but Lewis has 30 days toappeal the court ruling. The property was sold to S.P.

"Damages: Yunus Rahmatullah is suing the Government for damages . A Pakistani man suing the Government for damages has detailed a horrific catalogue of abuse and torture he claims to have suffered at the hands of British troops before they handed him over to US interrogators. Yunus Rahmatullah, released without charge by the United States in May after ten years in captivity, says his British captors beat him, dragged him along the ground behind a vehicle and threw him in a pen containing dogs that attacked him. His shocking 62-page witness statement, obtained by The Mail on Sunday, also reveals allegations that British Special Forces waterboarded Mr Rahmatullah, sprinkled cigarette ash on his food and locked him in a ‘coffin-like’ container with cold water dripping on his head. Last month the High Court dismissed Government attempts to throw out his case by claiming it could damage British relations with the US – a defence undermined by the Senate’s devastating torture report. His allegations are some of the most serious made against British troops in recent years. Lawyers expect the Supreme Court to determine if they can be heard in open court alongside its anticipated decision on the case of Libyan dissident Abdul-Hakim Belhadj. In addition to his claim for damages, Mr Rahmatullah is demanding an independent investigation into his allegations of abuse and British complicity with rendition and torture – something being strongly resisted by the Government. According to the statement, Mr Rahmatullah, who grew up in Qatar, went to Iraq in early 2004 to start a rice importation business. Ten days later troops burst into his apartment while he was asleep and beat him with rifles until he became unconscious. When he awoke he was bound, drenched in blood, hooded and lying ‘on what he believed to be dead bodies in plastic bags’ on the floor of a vehicle. After a subsequent helicopter flight during which he was beaten again, he awoke when water was thrown in his face on a military base. ‘The soldiers on the military base wore beige sand-coloured uniforms with the British flag on the right arm,’ the statement says. ‘The claimant recognised the British flag from his school geography lessons.’ He claims he was then asked a barrage of questions by interrogators who threatened to kill him and said they had ‘shot and killed’ his flatmates, later showing photographs of their bodies. Mr Rahmatullah alleges his bound hands were then tied by rope to a vehicle, which accelerated quickly and dragged him along the ground. ‘His left arm, left shoulder and the left side of his face were badly scraped and bled significantly,’ says the statement. The document also claims he was thrown in a pen containing ‘a number of large dogs’ wearing muzzles, which clawed and scratched him. The captive was then put in a room only 3ft wide by 3ft long. Soldiers in the same beige uniforms cut off his clothes, drenched him in cold water and turned up the air conditioning so that he froze. The next day he was waterboarded repeatedly until he lost consciousness. Over the following 36 hours, Mr Rahmatullah says he was given just one glass of water and a jam biscuit. Then he was handed a tiny portion of rice and chicken. ‘The person who brought the food to the claimant spread the ashes of his cigarette on top of the food and said, “This is the seasoning for your food.’’ ’ Mr Rahmatullah says he was then forced to lie on his back in ‘an enclosed chamber that was approximately 40cm high… the claimant felt like he was in a coffin. The lid of this chamber had holes in the top and very cold water was poured in slowly through the holes, which then dripped slowly on to the top of the claimant’s head.’ Finally, the soldiers told him since he was not co-operating, he would be handed over to the Americans and sent to Abu Ghraib, the Baghdad prison from which photographs emerged of US troops mistreating prisoners. The alleged abuse continued in two US detention centres, at least one of which was thought to be Abu Ghraib. This included threats of sexual assault, beatings with rubber flex, urine poured on his head, and being suspended upside down and dunked in water. At one stage a female soldier entered his cell and ‘forcefully tied a rope’ around his neck. ‘The woman pulled the rope tight until it dug into the claimant’s flesh, choking him. She untied the claimant’s hands from the wall and dragged him along the floor by the rope.’ On another occasion he claims to have been thrown on top of six naked detainees piled on top of each other and kept in the cell for two or three days. ‘He is currently too traumatised to provide further details about that period of detention,’ records the statement. Finally, he was transferred to Bagram, the US airbase and detention centre in Afghanistan, where he was put in solitary confinement. He had no contact with family until 2010, enduring force-feeding after hunger strikes and mysterious ‘paralysing injections’. Kat Craig, legal director at campaign group Reprieve and his lawyer, said: ‘During this decade, Mr Rahmatullah was tortured not just by American but also British personnel. Last week’s CIA torture report from the US demonstrates that it’s time for Britain too to come clean about its part in this shameful chapter.’","Yunus Rahmatullah released in May by the US after ten years in captivity .

"The Ukip activist picked last week to fight a key Parliamentary seat made homophobic, racist and obscene comments and accused Nigel Farage of corruption, it was revealed last night. In tape-recorded phone calls leaked to The Mail on Sunday, Kerry Smith, chosen to fight Ukip target seat of Basildon South in Essex: . But Mr Farage last night refused to sack Mr Smith. A well-placed Ukip official said: ‘Kerry wants to make a full apology and is hoping it all blows over.’ Scroll down for audio . Kerry Smith (left) was recorded making a series of astonishing comments including a baseless claim Nigel Farage (right) had accepted 'a nice fat envelope' for promoting a Ukip ally . In a desperate attempt to avoid being fired, Mr Smith has made a grovelling apology and withdrawn his corruption claim. In a statement made on Smith’s behalf by Farage’s official spokesman, Smith said: ‘I wish to issue a wholehearted and unreserved apology to those who I have offended within the party and anyone else.’ Smith also retracted his claim that Nigel Farage had accepted a ‘nice fat envelope’ for promoting Ukip immigration spokesman Steve Woolfe over his rival, Euro MP David Coburn, in the 2012 London Assembly elections. The Mail on Sunday understands there is no truth in the allegations and that neither Mr Farage nor Mr Woolfe did anything wrong. The false claim was due to a ‘misunderstanding,’ said Smith. He added: ‘With regards to the leadership and management of the party I was completely wrong and my comments were fuelled by frustrations.’ The homophobic comments by Smith refer to a Ukip gay group called LGBTQ. The ‘Q’ added to the usual LGBT initials stands for ‘Queer/Questioning.’ The disclosure of the tape recording is the latest outbreak of vicious infighting in Ukip. Smith was sacked as Ukip candidate for Basildon South and East Thurrock earlier this year and right wing former Tory MP Neil Hamilton was a hot favourite to be chosen to replace him last week. With Ukip support rising fast, the party has high hopes of winning Basildon South. Alexandra Swann insists affairs and sexual harassment is more commonplace throughout Westminster than thought . The sexual harassment of young, female aides by high-powered Wesminster politicians is more rife than ever imagined, one former European Parliament assistant has claimed. In the week that a Ukip candidate alleged she had been sexually harassed by the party's former general secretary, Roger Bird, another of the party's insiders has said incidents such as the woman's claims are 'prevalent'. Alexandra Swann, former Ukip assistant in the European Parliament, has revealed it is an 'open secret' that one Cabinet Minister has indulged in two affairs with junior staff members, while another 'prominent' politician enjoyed an 'insatiable' appetite for later-night phone sex. 'I know from my experience working in Westminster and Brussels for UKIP just how prevalent these incidents are - but in all parties, not just UKIP,' Miss Swann said. 'In Westminster it is an open secret that one senior Cabinet minister has had two affairs with junior staff members over the past few years, right under his wife’s nose. 'Another senior politician – one of the most prominent of the past two decades – had a seemingly insatiable appetite for late-night phone sex when in his office, all conducted while his wife slept a few doors away. 'When that wasn’t enough for him, a ""dinner"" would be arranged at the London home of a party donor, with him and his mistress as the only guests, and the host not even present. 'Another former Tory cabinet minister maintained a heated relationship with his young special adviser, but only ever behind the locked doors of his hotel room when she was accompanying him on overnight trips. 'She would innocently go inside with papers for him to sign, and simply not emerge until morning. 'If your husband is a cabinet minister and has developed a fondness for touring the country’s Travelodges, you’ve got reason to worry.' Miss Swann added it was a 'depressing yet enduring' element of her job that she felt the need to 'learn who to avoid in lifts and taxis;. 'Female friends used to refer to one Labour shadow cabinet minister as NSIT, meaning ‘not safe in taxis. 'Over the years, his unwanted attentions have grown so voracious, he’s now known as NSA: ‘not safe anywhere’. Mr Smith was last week announced as the candidate chosen to replace Neil Hamilton (pictured)  for the seat of Basildon South in Essex . But in a shock last minute move, Smith, leader of the Labour group was reinstated. Nigel Farage’s General Election plans were thrown into doubt last night after Ukip’s single-biggest funder announced that he was suspending donations. Multi-millionaire Paul Sykes, who has given Ukip about £1.3 million over the past year, said he wanted ‘grassroots’ members to finance the party’s Election campaign instead. He told The Mail on Sunday he was making ‘no commitment’ about future big donations to the party because that would ‘destroy’ Ukip’s bid to build up a grassroots base and he was ‘standing back’ because party membership fees were rising. He added: ‘I am making no commitment and no statement regarding me writing big cheques out to Ukip because it destroys the fabric of what we are trying to build.’ The move will potentially be a huge blow to Mr Farage’s plans for a breakthrough next year by winning Commons seats. Ex-tyre fitter Mr Sykes, whose cash was crucial to Ukip’s record results in this year’s European elections, has been the party’s single most important funder. Last night Mr Farage said: ‘For a political party to be too dependent on a few donors is not a good thing.’ Asked if Ukip could make up any donations shortfall from other sources, Mr Farage said: ‘We’ll have to.’ The party is reportedly in line for a £300,000 donation from Daily Express owner Richard Desmond. Hamilton was forced to pull out after damaging information about his expenses claims were leaked by Ukip enemies. Ukip insiders say Farage was determined to stop Hamilton because of his controversial past in the notorious ‘cash for questions’ scandal in the 1990s. Hamilton’s allies claim Farage is ‘jealous’ of him and fears if Hamilton became MP for Basildon South and Farage fails to win in Thanet South across the Thames Estuary, Hamilton would be the party’s most high profile politician. Some Ukip insiders say the decision to deselect Smith as Basildon South candidate earlier this year came after a copy of the recording was sent to party HQ. ‘Farage’s people heard it and that is why Kerry was booted out,’ said one insider. ‘They were panicked into reinstating him because they were more worried about Hamilton getting the seat. ‘They gambled that the tape wouldn’t be leaked. Now it has. It serves them right. ‘We cannot have grubby people like Kerry in the party, let alone standing for Parliament.’ Hamilton was on a list of five candidates in the running to become Ukip’s candidate for South Basildon. He claimed he was the victim of a ‘dirty tricks’ campaign when a letter challenging claims for staying in his wife’s flat was leaked to the media just hours before the selection. His withdrawal triggered a toxic row after the party’s second largest donor, Stuart Wheeler, reportedly threatened to cut off funds unless Hamilton was picked as a candidate for next year’s General Election. It led to a furious reaction from Ukip’s treasurer, Andrew Reid, who said: ‘Nobody gets to buy a seat for someone else in Ukip.’ Ukip game to rate 'blacks' and Muslims to win £100... or golf umbrella: Farage in another race row over 'rate on immigrant' survey . The Ukip leader has found himself embroiled in another row over race . Nigel Farage was in another race row last night after asking supporters to rate ‘blacks, Muslims and Eastern Europeans’ in a game – with prizes of cash and a Ukip golf umbrella. The ‘rate an immigrant’ survey is part of a Ukip private survey of members aimed at helping the party draw up its policies. Sent last week by Ukip chairman Steve Crowther, it asks members to say ‘how close they feel’ to a number of groups. They include ‘Blacks, Asians, Muslims, English, Eastern Europeans and Whites’ as well as the four main political parties. Ukip activists are urged to rate each on a scale from 0 for ‘not close at all’ to 10 for ‘very close.’ But the survey was slammed as a racist stunt after details were leaked to The Mail on Sunday. Last night, senior Labour MP Margaret Hodge condemned the Ukip survey as ‘shocking’. Mrs Hodge, who won a campaign against the BNP in her Barking constituency in east London, said: ‘This openly brings race into politics. It’s shameful, it’s shocking and it’s offensive. 'It lifts the lid on the unacceptable face of Ukip.’ The survey comes after a series of claims of racism involving Ukip, although Farage has insisted ‘stupid or offensive’ comments by a handful of candidates ‘never have and never will’ represent the views of his party. The email to thousands of Ukip members from chairman Crowther is headed: ‘Help the Party and Win Prizes!’ It declares: ‘Ukip is growing quickly. We want to strengthen our party by understanding our rapidly growing membership. We are asking all our members to complete a new survey.’ The aim was to ‘use the insights to strengthen the Ukip operation… Your responses will be invaluable in making sure we fulfil our promises over the coming years – and in government! ‘So please, do complete the survey. It should be fun! You might even win some prizes!’ Prizes included ‘one prize of £100, two of £50, three prizes of a Ukip golf umbrella, four prizes of £25, five Ukip notebooks and six Ukip pocket diaries.’ Other Ukip race rows include: . A Ukip spokesman denied the survey was racist, claiming every major employer carried out similar research of their staff.","Kerry Smith made series of astonishing remarks in recorded conversation .

"Julian Bell has been criticised by Tory politicians for owning a £1million home while staying on as a housing association tenant . The leader of one of Ed Miliband’s flagship Labour councils was last night embroiled in a row over claims his family is still living in ‘social housing’ – even though he owns a £1 million house nearby. Julian Bell, head of Labour-run Ealing Council in West London, has been branded a ‘hypocrite’ after buying a five-bedroom property while staying on as a housing association tenant. Mr Bell, who is a fierce critic of Coalition cuts and has protested at housing shortages, is now facing demands to explain why part of his family is still in social housing seven years after he bought his home a few hundred yards away. Tory critics yesterday called on him to surrender the housing association home to ‘people who really need it’. However, the council leader has insisted his housing arrangements are ‘completely appropriate and transparent’. Mr Bell, 55, who has claimed his council faces ‘doom’ from Government-imposed cutbacks, has regularly highlighted the need for more ‘affordable’ homes. But a dossier sent to all Ealing councillors last week accused him of continuing to use a rented home in Acton even though he has a substantial house in the same area. Records show that Mr Bell and his wife Hermia bought the property in September, 2007 for £585,000. It is now worth about £1 million. However, instead of giving up their housing association property, the couple, who have four daughters, including television presenter Angellica Bell, have been accused of using both homes. Friends said that while Mr Bell lives in the home he bought, his wife and mother-in-law are based at the housing association house. Last night, Tory politicians called on him to give up the home. Greg Stafford, Tory leader in Ealing, said: ‘At the very least, this looks like hypocrisy. ‘The council leader has a moral duty to ensure that social housing goes to people who desperately and genuinely need it.’ Mr Bell last night condemned what he described as ‘unfounded and untrue allegations’ made against his family.

But he added: ‘I am keen to make absolutely clear all the arrangements relating to my social housing tenancy with A2Dominion Housing Group are completely appropriate and transparent. ‘Over a number of years, I have had to make a number of decisions regarding my family’s housing situation to enable my wife and I to care for frail and elderly relatives with complex care needs, a situation exacerbated by a number of extremely challenging issues relating to our house move. ‘I have always been completely open with council colleagues throughout what has been a difficult time for my family and I.’ Friends claimed that Mr Bell had been working on adapting his own house to make it ready for a disabled relative to move in.","Julian Bell bought five-bedroom property in West London seven years ago .

"Forget squats and bicep curls – ballet is the new way to stay in shape in fashionable circles. Model Jourdan Dunn started attending the BarreCore ballet studios in London last month. The studio claims the barre method of stretching helps women sculpt firm, elongated muscles while keeping their feminine shape and toning their tummy. Want to look like this? British Victoria's Secret Angel Jourdan Dunn keeps fit with ballet classes . ‘Jourdan’s been coming about once a day since her first class – she’s loving it,’ says a fellow class member. ‘She is naturally co-ordinated, because of her modelling work, but barre involves holding poses for long periods of time and stretching out the muscles, and she had to pay attention to pick it up just like anyone else. 'Now she’s been so often she knows what movement to do before the teacher announces it. ‘She often attends with some other gorgeous women, and now everyone makes more of an effort with their grooming and gym gear.’ Abs ahead: Jourdan Dunn . Coping with the challenges of secondary school can be much harder for teenagers with dyspraxia, a disorder that affects co-ordination and sometimes speech.

"The son of a flamboyant Soho nightclub boss dubbed the ‘king of the booze cruise’ has been charged with his murder after allegedly stabbing him in a drunken row. David West, 70, a self-styled ‘lord’, died of a single knife wound at his £2.5million Mayfair home on Friday. The divorced father of three, who bought the title ‘Lord of the Manor of Hollesley’ on eBay, worked closely with his son, also called David West, 44. Nightclub owner David West, centre, was found stabbed to death at his home in Mayfair on Friday night . Police were called to a building where the men lived in adjacent flats at 6pm on Friday. West Jr was arrested nearby and is due to appear at Westminster magistrates’ court today. Yesterday friends paid tribute to the man dubbed ‘king of the booze cruise’ who made millions flogging £1-a-bottle wine and cigarettes to coaches of Brits. The cockney, known for his £5,000 Italian pink suits, mullet haircut and crocodile skin shoes, rose from barrow boy to head a £100million empire and once tried to sue David and Victoria Beckham for slander for saying he was not welcome at their World Cup party despite paying £100,000 for a ticket. West said they did not want him at the 2006 ball, banned him from carrying a mobile phone and told him his pink suit was against the dress code. A High Court judge threw out the case, however. A year later, he hired barrister Cherie Blair to fight the public smoking ban – then a flagship policy of her husband Tony Blair’s government. The prime minister’s wife was taken to West’s erotic nightclub Hey Jo, named after his 21-year-old girlfriend Joanna Dudzik – who he lavished £400,000 on, then took to the High Court to try to curb her spending. Mrs Blair’s tour of the £4million club, with its explicit decor, ‘bondage booth’ and waitresses dressed as nurses, caused a sensation. The flamboyant man's 44-year-old son, also called David West, was charged with his murder on Saturday night . A post-mortem examination revealed that a single stab wound was the cause of Mr West's death . David West, pictured in a pink suit with his Bentley, owned a popular Mayfair nightclub and restaurant . Traces of polonium-210 were later found in the club after two ex-KGB agents wanted for the murder of Russian spy Alexander Litvinenko visited in 2007. West, from Romford, Essex, started as an East End market trader before he and his wife Kathy opened greasy spoon cafes in Belgium and Calais. His firm, EastEnders, became part of Europe’s largest British-owned cash-and-carry group – with its own wine label, The Dogs B*******. His 30-year marriage failed in 1999 when he took up with a 23-year-old French blonde, quickly followed by a series of young girlfriends. West admitted trawling Russian bride websites and at one stage shared his flat with three Estonian girls. He ran a talent firm, a restaurant called Abracadabra and a Mayfair lapdancing club, Puss In Boots. He also owned 4 Star Hostel, a women’s guesthouse near Piccadilly Circus, and gentlemen’s club Mandy’s. Last night his business associate Harry Barnett, 72, who was friends with West for 60 years, said: ‘I can’t believe it. They were very close. Dave lived with his dad all his life, apart from when he was married. The pensioner, originally from Romford, Essex, started his career as a market trader in the East End of London . The 70-year-old's son, also called David West, has been charged with his murder and is due in court on Monday . He owned Mayfair night club HeyJo (pictured) and the Abracadabra restaurant, both located on Jermyn Street . ‘It’s his other son, James, I feel for now. He is in bits. He’s lost his dad and his brother in one hit.’ At his home in Brentwood, Essex, West’s youngest son James said: ‘We want to keep it a private matter.’ West once said of his children: ‘I gave them some money – enough to start their own businesses – and waved them off. ‘They drive the flash cars and wear all the trendy designer gear, but I have to hope we’ve brought them up right. The best thing in the world would be for me to see them making a go of a business. It’s all I ever wanted, and it’s all I’ve ever done.’ Last night friends remembered West online. Mickey Helliet said: ‘Really going to miss him, a real character.’ Jelena Gauthier said: ‘Such a gracious host, flamboyant man and a playful soul.’ Alex Mills, who starred in The Apprentice last year, tweeted: ‘Terribly sad news.’ As well as HeyJo (pictured) he also is believed to have owned a gentleman's club called Mandy's . Mr West lived in a three-bedroom house in Ormond Yard, where police and paramedics were called on Friday .

"Unions expect thousands of jobs to go as the Abbott government prepares to axe 175 government agencies. The hit-list is in addition to the 76 announced in the May budget, and the total is estimated to save taxpayers more than $500 million over four years. The government aims to cut duplication, streamline services and outsource to the private sector. Reports of the savings measures come as Treasurer Joe Hockey prepares to release the Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook on Monday, which economists say could reveal a deficit for 2014/15 upwards of $35 billion. Reports of the plans come as Treasurer Joe Hockey, pictured left beside Finance minister Senator Matthias Cormann, prepares to release the Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook on Monday . Community and Public Sector Union national secretary Nadine Flood said there had already been 8000 public service job losses this year and the proposed outsourcing would take a heavy toll. 'We could see anywhere between one (thousand) and in fact eight to nine thousand jobs go,' she told ABC TV. 'This seems to be an ideologically blinkered approach that says public bad, private better.' Finance Minister Mathias Cormann confirmed there would be some impact on jobs and would not rule out forced redundancies. 'We inherited a bloated public service from our predecessors,' Senator Cormann told Sky News on Saturday. 'The goal is to ensure that the government is as big as it needs to be but as small as it can be.' 'The goal is to ensure that the government is as big as it needs to be but as small as it can be,' said Finance Minister Mathias Cormann on Saturday . Opposition Leader Bill Shorten warned Australia's economy was in danger of stalling and now was not the time for mass sackings. 'The finance minister's talking gobbledegook ... it's a cliche masquerading as an economic policy,' he told reporters in Brisbane. The national unemployment rate reached a 12-year high of 6.3 per cent in November. The Australian Government Solicitor is among agencies that will be dismantled. Opposition legal affairs spokesman Mark Dreyfus said it was short-sighted to cut an agency that had been providing government legal services since federation. 'Any legal work that would have been undertaken by the AGS will simply be contracted out to private law firms for a much higher price,' he said. In his weekend YouTube message, Prime Minister Tony Abbott said a lot of good things happened in 2014, adding 'our policies are creating jobs, helping families and bringing the budget back under control.' Shadow assistant treasurer Andrew Leigh said a similar slash-and-burn exercise in the early years of the Howard government backfired eventually. '(They) lost a whole lot of corporate memory, but by the end of their time in office, the number of public servants per Australian was back where it had started,' he told Sky News. Labor and the Greens are urging the government to use Monday's budget review to drop unpopular measures such as changes to university fees, GP co-payments and cuts to pensions. But Prime Minister Tony Abbott is staying the course.

"A force of up to 100 Paras is being sent to join the battle against Islamic State (IS) with authority to shoot and kill when needed. The elite troops are the first detachment of British soldiers to go to Iraq in a fighting role since 2009. The Paras’ job will be to protect around 350 British military instructors who are being sent out in January to train the Iraqi army and Kurdish peshmerga forces. Scroll down for video . Shoot to kill: Up to 100 British Paras are being sent to Iraq to join the battle against ISIS . Should they come under attack from IS, the Paras – expected to be drawn from the regiment’s second battalion – will be authorised to shoot and kill the jihadis. With the Paras and other international troops providing a ring of steel around the training camps in northern Iraq, the British instructors will seek to improve the skills of the locally raised forces so they can defeat IS in a so-called ‘spring offensive’ pencilled in for April. British and US commanders are hoping to raise a force of 20,000 Iraqis and Kurds to push back IS forces from strategically significant cities such as Mosul. They will be backed by air strikes and also drone attacks, which are playing an increasingly critical role in the campaign. The ramping up of Britain’s training mission in Iraq will be approved by the UK’s National Security Council next week and formally announced by Defence Secretary Michael Fallon in Parliament. Defence sources confirmed last night that the British deployment to Iraq would include a ‘force protection’ element with soldiers being sent there for up to six months. But last night former British military intelligence officer Frank Ledwidge raised concerns that the increase in UK troops would inevitably lead to casualties. Defence Secretary Michael Fallon will make the formal announcement in Parliament next week . Mr Ledwidge, who served in Iraq in 2004, said: ‘The British troops will have a big red flag on them and will be a big target for IS. ‘The threat is likely to come from car bombings and suicide attacks so the force protection element of the deployment will need to be proactive. ‘They won’t just be guarding the perimeter of the camp, they’ll have to patrol and interact closely with local security forces. It will be a risky and complex job. ‘This is definitely “mission creep” and if or when UK casualties are taken next year I’d expect to see the size of the British deployment to Iraq increase. ‘Post-Afghanistan the British Army is looking for a new role in order to maintain its sense of purpose and its troop numbers because the Ministry of Defence will not be protected from the sharp cuts in public spending that are on the horizon. So the generals will be thrilled by this deployment.’ The move to increase Britain’s commitment to the war against IS follows a review by UK military advisers. Their conclusions were sent to Mr Fallon. The Government has insisted repeatedly that the training mission will not constitute ‘boots on the ground’ and in accordance with this policy, the Paras’ role will be strictly defensive. Two months ago a team of 12 soldiers from the Yorkshire Regiment were sent to northern Iraq to teach the Peshmerga how to use heavy machine guns. A UK advisory team is also based in the Iraqi capital Baghdad while, as The Mail on Sunday has exclusively revealed, British Special Forces have conducted a series of attacks against IS and are believed to have killed hundreds of jihadis. Last week the US announced that it was committing 1,500 troops to training Iraqi forces while up to 400 Australian soldiers and 100 German personnel will also be involved. These international troops will be confined to training bases but their mere presence will require security procedures to be stepped up. A Ministry of Defence spokesman said last night: ‘The Defence Secretary announced the intention to provide further training to the Iraqi military in early November. ‘No decision on troop numbers, units or locations have been made, so this is purely speculation at this stage.’","Paras' job will be to protect 350 British instructors being sent in January .

"Jim Murphy (with new deputy leader Kezia Dugdale, above) has vowed to defeat 'arrogant' SNP leaders . Former Cabinet Minister Jim Murphy became Scottish Labour leader yesterday – vowing to defeat ‘arrogant’ Scottish Nationalist leaders Alex Salmond and Nicola Sturgeon. Talking to The Mail on Sunday, Murphy: . Murphy, 47, who achieved a decisive victory over union-backed rival Neil Findlay, succeeds Johann Lamont who was forced to quit after failing to stop the party’s plummeting ratings in Scotland. The former Secretary of State for Scotland is giving up his Westminster seat to lead a Labour fightback. If he succeeds, it could help Mr Miliband win next year’s General Election. But the men are not Labour allies. Blairite Murphy led the unsuccessful Labour leadership campaign of David Miliband in 2010 and was bitter at being sidelined by Ed Miliband. Murphy sidestepped questions about his relations with Ed Miliband. Instead he poured scorn on Salmond’s decision to try to win a Commons seat after resigning following his defeat in the referendum. Pointing out it will be Salmond’s third return to Westminster, Murphy said: ‘For someone who, allegedly, wants Scotland to free itself from the Commons, Alex going back there for a third time suggests he doesn’t dislike it as much as he pretends.’ And he took another swipe at Salmond for standing in the Westminster constituency of Gordon, Aberdeenshire, where he is already a member of the Scottish Assembly, instead of Glasgow. ‘Alex hasn’t had the courage to stand in Scotland’s biggest city. Instead he decided to stand in Aberdeenshire. He has a right to do that, but it would have been more confident if he’d stood in Glasgow. ‘For Alex, all the problems of the world are solved by the simple slogan of independence. Most Scots know the world is more complicated than that. A lot of good people who voted Yes in Glasgow are scunnered.’ It means ‘fed up or p****d off,’ he explains. ‘They are scunnered they’ve got David Cameron as PM.’ Murphy feels his own sense of frustration that, despite the result of the referendum – and his brave personal campaign, during which he was pelted with eggs and even branded a paedophile by demonstrators – Salmond and Sturgeon have stepped up demands for more power from Westminster, and possibly another referendum. Mr Murphy criticised Alex Salmond and his decision to stand as an MP again, adding that he does not have 'the courage' to stand in Scotland's biggest city. The new Labour leader in Scotland said many who voted Yes in the September referendum were left 'fed up' with David Cameron as their Prime Minister . Mr Murphy blamed Labour for the rise of the SNP who, they said, were able to 'capture the symbols and emotions of patriotism like the St Andrew's flag' ‘Labour has been magnanimous in victory in the referendum, the SNP has been victorious in defeat. There’s a sense of arrogance about the SNP. The public like confident politicians, but they don’t like arrogant ones.’ Labour has itself to blame for the rise of the SNP, argues Murphy. ‘Just as Scotland was becoming more confident and outgoing, the Scottish Labour Party allowed the SNP to capture all the symbols and emotions of patriotism like the St Andrew’s flag. ‘I want to turn it into a contest between patriotism and nationalism – they are different. Patriotism is pride in your country, people and history. Nationalism is harder edged.’ How did he respond to McCluskey’s claim that victory for Murphy would be a ‘political death sentence for Labour’ in Scotland? ‘Len doesn’t have a vote in Scotland, he doesn’t live in Scotland so I shrug my shoulders. I’m not a fan of that kind of politics.’","Former Cabinet Minister Jim Murphy is the new Scottish Labour leader .

Galatasaray fans let off flares in the away end at Borussia Dortmund's Signal Iduna Park on Tuesday . Smoke from a flare thrown onto the pitch by a Galatasaray fan fills the air in Dortmund . Firefighters work to extinguish a flare which had been thrown into the home stand by a Galatasaray supporter . Flares were thrown at police officers and cars during the 60 minute march, with reports suggesting that two police officers were injured. By the time they reached the stadium at 19.20, there had already been ten arrests. Fans of the Turkish side then set about tearing out seats to throw at other fans, and the unrest continued well into the game. When Dortmund scored their final goal to secure the 4-1 victory, a flare was even thrown into the Dortmund fan block. 'We saw what happened,' said Dortmund player Sebastian Kehl, 'you just think, what idiots are doing that. Is anyone injured? There could be kids in that block.' After the match, there were more arrests. Police are now investigating for attempted murder, breaches of the peace, and disregard of the Law on Explosives. Angry Borussia Dortmund fans move towards the travelling supporters after the final whistle . Play was stopped while staff dealt with flares thrown onto the pitch by Galatasaray fans . A flare flies through the air during a heated night in the stands at Signal Iduna Park . Police also had to deal with Dortmund fans after the game. After the final whistle, a number of Dortmund supporters charged through stewards and security 'in order to attack the Galatasary block', according to police spokesman Oliver Peiler. This is not the first time fans of the Turkish club have caused problems at a Champions League game. Their away fixture against Arsenal was also halted due to fans throwing flares onto the pitch, and ripping up seats. The club was eventually fined £40,000 by UEFA. This time around, the punishment threatens to be more severe. Like the game against Arsenal, it was left to Galatasaray's own players to persuade the fans to calm down. At the Emirates, Wesley Sneijder and goalkeeper Fernando Muslera acted as the peacekeepers. In Dortmund, Muslera was once again in the mix, alongside Felipe Melo and Hamit Altintop. Dortmund players look towards the visiting supporters during the stoppage in play on Tuesday . The game eventually restarted, with Borussia Dortmund comfortably winning 4-1 against the Turkish side . Altintop, who is German by birth, said after the game that 'Individuals need to take responsibility. It doesn't even need saying that fans should express their discontent in a different way. We as a club definitely need to ask questions about this, and strive to present ourselves better.' Jurgen Klopp described the Galatasaray fans as being 'purely provocative', and regretted that, once again, fan behaviour had distracted from the football. 'Unfortunately, I can't say that this has never happened to us. We've also been responsible for scenes a bit like this in the past. But it has thrown a shadow over a fantastic game for us. It was pure provocation', said the Dortmund coach.","Borussia Dortmund beat Galatasaray 4-1 on Tuesday evening .

"Lionel Messi has agreed a new contract at Barcelona with the Argentina superstar set to become the world's highest-paid player on £16.3million a year. The player’s father Jorge met club officials Javier Faus and Antoni Rossich last week and closed what is the seventh new deal in 11 years for the four-time Ballon d’Or winner. Messi will be 27 in June and the new deal is not expected to extend his existing contract length taking him to 2018. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Messi score from behind the goal in training . He's staying: Lionel Messi has agreed to sign a new deal keeping him at Barcelona . Boost: Messi agreeing a new deal is the news the Barcelona fans had been waiting for . But his . earnings have been boosted to put him ahead of Real Madrid’s Cristiano . Ronaldo, who earns £15m before bonuses. Wayne Rooney, the highest-paid player in England, is on £15.6m a year (£300,000 a week). Messi’s . previous deals have been structured so that basic pay before bonuses is . re-set each year of the deal according to bonuses earned the previous . season. In . effect Messi will earn £16.3m next season but if he wins the Champions . League the appropriate bonus will be added and the sum total will become . his new basic pay level the following season. Messi’s . £250m buy-out clause will remain the same leaving the door open for . Manchester City or Paris Saint-Germain to make a bid, though the rigours . of Financial Fair Play surely rule out such a move for either club. Warming up: Messi and his Barcelona team-mates trained on Friday ahead of Saturday's crunch clash . A . statement issued by the Catalans on Friday read: 'FC Barcelona has . reached an agreement to adjust the terms in the contract binding Leo . Messi to the club as a professional first team player. The revised and . updated contract will be signed over the next few days.' Barca . had wanted a grand unveiling of Messi’s new deal but time ran out on . them as preparations for Saturday’s La Liga decider against Atletico . Madrid took over. The . player is understood to have put back his return to Argentina ahead of . World Cup preparations so he can sign the new deal at the start of next . week. Most . crucially from the club’s point of view, Messi’s new deal means Barca . will now be better placed to tap in to the huge stream of commercial . revenue he generates as for the first time since signing his initial . deal in 2005 the player will not keep 100 per cent of his image rights - they . will now be shared with the club. Jorge . Messi finally agreed to the revision in last week’s crunch meeting. In . that meeting he was also told that the club’s new manager for next . season will be Luis Enrique. New . signings were not discussed although it is no secret that the Barca . forward is close pals with Manchester City striker Sergio Aguero and . would love him to join him at the Nou Camp. A bid for Aguero would only be possible if Barcelona successfully off-loaded forwards Alexis Sanchez and Pedro. The . club are also keen to move on Alex Song and Javier Mascherano as they . look to beat Bayern Munich to the signing of Chelsea’s Brazil defender David Luiz.","Messi now paid more than Cristiano Ronaldo (£15m a year)

"The Minnesota man . accused of fatally shooting two teenagers has a surveillance system that . recorded the cousins as they broke into his home on Thanksgiving . Day. The warrants allege Byron David Smith was sitting in . a basement chair when he shot Nicholas Brady, 17, and that he shot Haile Kifer, 18, minutes . later. The warrants also say Smith appeared to have blood on his shoes . and clothes when authorities arrived. Authorities learned of the video and . audio recordings while searching Smith's home. They subsequently seized . several computer memory cards and computer equipment. Scroll down for video . Killed: The bodies of cousins Haile Kifer, 18, left, and Nicholas Brady, 17, right, were found stashed in the . basement of a man who claimed the teens broke into his home on . Thanksgiving . Before the burglary was discovered, . deputies were called to Smith's neighborhood because a red Mitsubishi . Eclipse was spotted in the driveway of a home owned by Richard L. Johnson, Morrison County Sheriff Michel Wetzel said. Nicholas . Brady, 17, had been driving that car, although it wasn't registered to . him. Deputies questioned him, but then let him go, Wetzel said. A day later, Byron Smith shot and killed Brady and Brady's 18-year-old cousin, Haile Kifer, in the basement of his Little Falls home. Smith told authorities that he disturbed the pair as they tried to break into his house and that he shot them in self-defense. The same red Mitsubishi Eclipse was discovered Friday parked around the corner from Smith's property. In custody: Byron Smith was arrested after admitting to police he had killed the teens a day earlier . 'There are some preliminary indications that the Johnson burglary may have been committed by the Brady boy and the Kifer girl, but it's too early now to say definitively,' Wetzel said, adding that more information could be made available later today. The Minneapolis StarTribune reported that Johnson, a retired high school teacher, had been in Spain and did not know his home had been burglarized until he returned to the home on Sunday. Johnson told the paper that he reported several items stolen from his house, including less than $5 in pennies kept in a box on his dresser, silver and copper coins, and some prescription medication, including drugs for diabetes and controlling cholesterol. Wetzel couldn't immediately say whether any of those missing items were found in Brady's car. In addition, Johnson reported a sliding glass door that had been broken. 'I do know they found quite a bit of evidence in their vehicle that was parked near the Smith place,' the sheriff said late Tuesday. 'We're trying to investigate whether it might have come from the Johnson burglary.' Smith, a retired U.S. State Department employee, was charged Monday with two counts of murder. According to the criminal complaint, Smith shot the teens multiple times. He told investigators his home had been broken into several times before. Minnesota law gives homeowners the right to protect themselves and their property, but Wetzel said they don't have the right to execute an intruder once the threat is neutralized. Johnson told the Star Tribune: 'The whole thing is . very sad that they lost their lives. In the same instance, if they . hadn't been breaking into houses, they'd be alive.' Smith told authorities that he was in his basement last Thursday when he heard a window break upstairs. Another break-in? A day before they were shot to death in Byron Smith's home, a car driven by Brady was spotted in the driveway of Richard L. Johnson's home in Little Falls . When he saw Brady on the basement stairwell, he fired at the teenager then shot him again in the face after he fell down. The complaint said Smith told an investigator: 'I want him dead.' Smith said he dragged Brady's body into his workshop. When Kifer came down the stairs, he shot her multiple times. He dragged her into the room and as she gasped for air, he fired what he described as a 'good clean finishing shot' under her chin 'up into the cranium,' the complaint said. Yesterday, Smith admitted that he fired 'more shots than he needed to,' as friends and family of the dead teens expressed outrage over their deaths. On Monday, he was charged with second-degree murder and police revealed he told them he fired more shots than necessary after his gun jammed and Kifer laughed at him. While Minnesota law stipulates people are allowed to use deadly force when defending their . homes, relatives, friends, police and prosecutors claimed Smith reacted too drastically by killing them. Missed: Friends and teacher expressed their shock at deaths and described Haile as a popular role model . Joker: Friends remembered Brady as an out-going student who loved to make people smile . 'A . person has every right to defend themselves and their homes, even . employing deadly force if necessary,' Morrison County Sheriff Michel . Wetzel said. 'Circumstances of this case however, led deputies to . believe that Smith went beyond that point.' And as he was charged on Monday, his intentions to shoot the teens dead became clear. In a criminal complaint, Smith said . he was in the basement of his home when he heard a window breaking and . footsteps. Fearful of other recent break-ins, he shot Brady when he came into view. When the teenager tumbled down the stars, Smith shot him in the face as he lay on the floor, looking up. 'I want him dead,' the complaint quoted Smith as telling an investigator. He dragged the body into his workshop . and then sat in the chair, the complaint said. When Kifer began walking . down the stairs, he shot her and she fell down the stairs. Scene: Smith has always claimed self-defense, saying he feared the teens were armed and he was on edge after earlier repeated break-ins at his home . He tried to shoot her again with his rifle, but the gun jammed and Kifer laughed at him, the complaint noted. 'If you're trying to shoot somebody and . they laugh at you, you go again,' Smith, 64, told investigators, according to a criminal complaint filed . Monday. He then shot her several times in the chest with a . .22-caliber revolver, dragged her next to her cousin, and with as she . gasped for air, fired a shot under her chin 'up into the cranium'. 'Smith described it as ""a good clean finishing shot"",' according to the . compliant, but acknowledged that he had fired 'more shots than . (he) needed to'. Smith said he left the bodies in his home overnight before calling a neighbor to ask if he knew a good lawyer. He later asked the neighbor to contact police. A prosecutor at Morrison County District Court . on Monday morning called Smith's reaction 'appalling.' Pain: Crystal Shaeffel, 27, cries after walking up the driveway of the home of Byron David Smith in Little Falls, Minnesota where her brother Nick Brady was shot and killed on Thursday . 'Mr. Smith intentionally killed two teenagers in his home in a matter . that goes well beyond self-defense,' Morrison County Attorney Brian . Middendorf said at the hearing. Friends have taken to a memorial Facebook page for Kifer and Schaeffel to vent their anger about the deaths. Others spoke out at a vigil for the youngsters on Sunday night. 'They were just really great people,' friend Rachel Stauffer, 15, told the Star Tribune. 'They . could make anyone laugh.' Carlee Davich, who coached Kifer in swimming at school, added: 'She was . always happy. She had a way that just made everyone happy. A lot of the . swimmers and divers looked up to her.' Emma Schmidt, a fellow classmate at Little Falls High School, said Kifer was talented and well-liked . and 'everyone's wondering' what she was doing in Smith's basement. Further . insight into the lives of the cousins was given by Brady's sister, . Crystal Shaeffel, as she visited Smith's home and spoke with his . brother. 'They were 17 and 18 years old, and didn't need to die,' she told Bruce Smith. Remembered: At a candle-lit vigil on Sunday, Rachel Brady speaks about her brother Nick to the crowd . 'That . all depends on your perspective,' he responded, referring to a series . of break-ins his brother had endured. In one in October, thieves stole . $10,000 worth of guns and electronics, he said. But Shaeffel insisted that her brother had no . need to turn to burglary, as he made good money working for their . father's tree-trimming business. She added that her cousin, who had undergone treatment for substance abuse, could have been after pills from the home. 'Yes, she had an addiction problem and stuff, but that doesn't mean she . deserves to get murdered at 18 years old,' Shaeffel said. 'I understand . they came there to rob them, or whatever, but shoot them in the shoulder . and call the cops.' On the Facebook page, friends agreed that the shootings were too severe. 'It doesn't matter what they . were or weren't doing there,' Mike Boulley wrote. 'They were KIDS that didn't deserve to die. Defending your property against armed burglars is one thing, gunning . down two unarmed teenagers is just inexcusable.' Support: Friends on a memorial Facebook page have asked whether the appropriate force was used . Logan Ayres added: 'It's hard to see . such nice people lose their lives to something that could of been so . easily taken care of instead of murder. R.I.P. nick and halie (sic) you will . be dearly missed.' Smith, 64, is currently being held on $2million bail. According to his friends, Smith said . that he had didn’t go to police immediately after the shooting because . he panicked about the deaths. 'He . was very traumatized by what had occurred and didn’t know who to call . or what to do and that is very sad that the whole thing even happened,' Kathy Lange told KSTP-TV. His brother, Bruce Smith, said that this was the latest of eight burglaries he had suffered in recent years. Byron Smith said that he suspected that the two had been responsible for at least some of those past robberies. Neighbors told the Star Tribune he kept . to himself, but they complained that he regularly shot guns on his . property and said they were concerned children playing nearby could be . hurt.

The airline said staff spoke with the passengers inside the terminal and they came to an 'amicable' resolution. In a scathing statement, China’s National Tourism Administration said the tourists disrupted the flight, hurt other passengers and ‘badly damaged the overall image of the Chinese people.’ The Chinese tourism administration did not say what punishment the tourists could face, but the statement suggested that the lead tour guide for the trip be punished for failing to offer proper behaviour guidance and that the tourists be blacklisted for bad credit.

"It's the vital ingredient which ensures Christmas dinner will go with ... well, a bang. This year we will pull apart 300 million crackers – that’s five for every person in the country – at a total cost of £60 million. That’s an awful lot of feeble puns, cheap toys and flimsy paper hats that disintegrate as soon as you try to get them around your head. Adam Lee-Potter (right) had his daughter Dory (left) put a range of Christmas crackers to the test. She found that Poundland's budget set of eight for a quid topped Harrods' set of six which cost over 130 times as much . Poundland's crackers might come with flimsy hats but they let out a great 'crack' and won't hurt your pocket . But high-end versions are also available. One luxury-goods website has launched a set of six for £4 million with gifts including Cartier necklaces, an Aston Martin coupé and a Sunseeker yacht ... but no jokes. Even the Royal Family’s meal is said to feature crackers, with the Queen believed to be especially fond of finding musical toys. Co-op's crackers promise more than they deliver, while Sainsbury's have an excellent bang and funky hats . At the other end of the scale, Poundland is offering eight crackers for a quid. Here we’ve put those budget versions, as well as supermarket favourites and designs from top-end stores, to the ultimate test – trying to impress my eight-year-old daughter, Dory. The most expensive we tested came from Harrods, which is selling a set of six for £99.50. Morrisons' family version are better than their luxury range, while you can't quibble with Tesco's 33p a pull . To make comparisons easier, we’ve calculated the cost per cracker, as they are variously sold in packs of six, eight or 12. Extraordinarily, Poundland comes out ahead of the luxury store – whose crackers cost more than 130 times as much. That, at least is Dory’s verdict in our entirely subjective test. Dory and I pulled the crackers apart to gauge the quality of the jokes, toys and hat within – and to ensure that the cracker gives that all-important satisfying bang. Conran's crackers are questionable value at nearly £15 a pull. Fortnum & Mason's are cheaper, and special . Crackers were invented in 1847 by Cockney confectioner Thomas Smith to shift his bon-bons – sugared almonds wrapped in tissue paper. He was said to have been inspired to add the ‘crack’ after hearing the crackle of a log on a fire. Other traditional elements – the gifts and paper hats – have been around since the days of Smith’s son, Walter, who introduced them to differentiate his product from a burgeoning number of rivals.

"Al Gore's youngest daughter has gotten remarried under a historic tree in Santa Barbara. Sarah Gore has a very casual outdoor service on Good Friday outside a coffee shop with her famous father walking across a patch of grass that served as the makeshift aisle. Wearing a loose, off-white lace dress with bell sleeves, Sarah made her way towards her groom, realtor Patrick Maiani, who was waiting for her beside the outline of a heart in the shape of rose petals. Down the grassy aisle: Sarah Gore was accompanied by her father, former Vice President Al, for the Friday morning wedding service near Santa Barbara, California . Up close: The wedding was attended by a handful of invited guests (including the bride's mother Tipper seen taking a picture in the foreground) as well as onlookers who realized what was going on . The brief service was officiated by a female religious leader and attended by about a dozen invited guests. The rest of the crowd was made of up onlookers- including Larry Nimmer who video taped the ceremony and uploaded it to his story Everyone Has A Story- who realized what was going on as soon as they spotted the service going on. This is the 35-year-old's second marriage, though it is unclear when exactly she and her first husband Bill Lee split. Sarah, a Harvard graduate who enrolled in medical school at the University of California-San Francisco before dropping out to become an artist, keeps a relatively low profile in spite of her father's fame and the latest articles written about her in 2012 noted that she was still married to Lee, a surfer and tech investor. Her new husband, Patrick Maiani, is a realtor at 1 Percent Real Estate Group. Rather than imply something about the wealth of their clientele, the name apparently comes from the realtor's agreement to only take one per cent of a commission per transaction. Symbolic: There was no altar involved in the outdoor service but the couple stood inside a heart-shaped ring of rose petals . Keeping with tradition: The biggest symbol of the ceremony was that the couple married underneath the Wardholme Torrey Pine, a historic tree that is the oldest of its kind in the world . She is now the only married member of the Gore family, as her two sisters- Karenna and Kristin- both split from their respective first husbands and their parents Al and Tipper announced their divorce in 2010. Both the former vice president and his ex wife were spotted at Sarah's wedding, standing side-by-side as they watched their grown daughter say her vows. Sarah's first wedding was dramatically different from the low-key affair that took place on Friday morning in Carpinteria, California. In 2007, Sarah opted for an opulent affair with hundreds of guests at the Beverly Hills Hotel. Happy: Sarah, who went to medical school but now is an artist living near Santa Barbara, split from her first husband sometime between 2012 and this weekend when she married Patrick Maiani (pictured), a local realtor . Theatrics: In keeping with the 'hippie' feel of her dress, Sarah opted for wooden wedges . Loving it: Gore was seen laughing at the big dip alongside his daughter Kristin . Instead of a multi-course, sit-down meal that guests were treated to at the first go around, the close friends and family had some coffee and snacks at Crushcakes, a coffee shop opposite the wedding site. Coffee shop manager Alyssa Murphy told People Magazine that the couples dozen or so guests dined on huevos rancheros, scrambled eggs and lattes. The former Vice President must have opted for some of the restaurant's baked goods instead, since he is famously vegan and does not eat animal products. 'It was a fun little intimate reception. They came in, had breakfast with their wedding party and cut their cake,' Ms Murphy said. Light hearted: Maiani goofs around with a flower in his mouth as Sarah cuts the cake . On the house: The manager of the coffee shop said that they gave her a strawberry blush cupcake . Opting for a public venue and a local coffeeshop also has another added benefit: a much lower final bill. The cost was likely not a determining factor, however, since the former Vice President's net worth is estimated to be more than $200million, a figure that shot up following the eight-figure sale of the TV network he launched, Current TV. The location of the wedding also makes sense when looking at the Gore family's shared interest in environmentalism, as the ceremony took place beneath the Wardholme Torrey pine tree, which is the oldest of its kind in the world. The fact that the wedding took place two days before Earth Day may just be a coincidence. Peace and love: The happy couple posted a photo of themselves holding up 'peace signs' in front of a peace symbol that adorns the wall in the coffee shop where they had their 'reception' Free spirits: Sarah and Patrick posed for a photo near the surf following the ceremony . Only one of Sarah's siblings- her sister Kristin- was spotted in the video that was shot by one of the onlookers. Neither her sister Karenna nor her brother Albert III were seen. Karenna Gore married Manhattan doctor Drew Schiff in 1997 and had three children before splitting in 2010, just months after her parents Al and Tipper announced their own separation after 40 years of marriage. Kristin Gore was the first of the family to file for divorce, splitting from her husband Paul Cusack in 2009 after four years of marriage. Introduction to the world: The Gore children (left) were on stage with the Clintons and Chelsea (right) when Al and Bill were nominated to the Democratic ticket in 1992 . Earlier break ups: Karenna and her husband Drew Schiff (left) separated in 2010 and Kristin and her husband Paul Cusack (right) split in 2009 . The marital status of their brother Albert III is unclear, but stayed out of the spotlight since his father left the White House, making news only on the two occasions when he was arrested for marijuana possession. The world was introduced to the Gore children in the early 1990s, and the then-teenagers' appearance at the 1992 Democratic Convention led to national crushes for many like-minded youngsters. They have kept much further from the spotlight in recent years, and the low-key style of Sarah's wedding is reflective of that change.","The former Vice President's youngest daughter has remarried in a low-key ceremony in California .

In a statement Outwood Grange Academy Trust said that the school has a proud record of supporting charities but some pupils were wearing five or six badges at one time. The school says it is happy for students to wear multiple charity badges on their bags or outside coats. Kayleigh’s mother, Deborah Handshaw, said: 'I understand that the school does have rules and regulations. The problem is I’ve never heard of this one. 'It was like they just woke up and decided that they didn’t want to see them anymore and they had to take them off.' Kayleigh, 14, has so far missed three days at school and is not sure when she will be able to return. Ms Handshaw said her daughter was stopped at the gate and told to remove the yellow flower she had worn for a year to show her support . Ms Handshaw said her daughter was stopped at the gate and told to remove the yellow flower she had worn for a year to show her support. After she refused to remove the badge, she was excluded for 'refusing a reasonable request'. Ms Handshaw said she has since had two meetings with the school but is still unclear when she can return and why she suddenly wasn't allowed to wear the badge she had worn for a year. Ms Handshaw, of Worksop, said: 'It is just a small, little yellow flower, it has been there for a year and is the only badge she wears on a her black blazer. 'Kayleigh asked the teacher if she could work in seclusion but with the badge on but he wouldn't have it. He wanted her to put it on her bag, that seems to be to only reasonable way. 'Now there is no sign of her going back to school unless she removed the badge. 'The choice has always been hers, I know she would take it off if I asked her but I wouldn't ask her to do that outside school and I wouldn't ask her to do it in school. 'This is simply a 14-year-old girl who has chosen to promote awareness.' Outwood Academy Portland has defended its decision to suspend pupils for wearing charity badges on their school uniform. Several pupils were suspended last week for wearing the badges on their blazers. The school says pupils are free to wear the badges on their bags and outdoor coats, but not on their blazers. A spokesman said in a statement: 'Outwood Grange Academies Trust has a proud record of supporting charities and encouraging each student to take part in charitable activities. Our trust actively supports the Help for Heroes charity amongst others. 'There are some students who were wearing five or six badges, some that include football, music or fashion, on their lapels and we feel this detracts from the drive to support individual charities. 'We organise a number of charity events throughout the school year which are highly successful in raising the profile and the importance of many charities. 'Students are given the opportunity to show their support for charities at particular times of the year to coincide with national or international appeals which often includes students wearing a particular badge, poppy, bangle or ribbon. 'To highlight the importance of these activities we ask that students refrain from wearing them throughout the year; a poppy, for example would lose its impact if it just became another badge. 'However we are more than happy for students to wear multiple charity badges on their bags or outside coats as this does not form part of the uniform.' Ms Handshaw said: 'I think that is ridiculous to say that a poppy loses its importance over a year, the person wearing it just chooses to remember all year round. 'It doesn't make it more important if they just remember for a short period of time. 'Kayleigh wants to remember all year round, every day, every minute. She has the opportunity to explain to people this is a Macmillan flower and what it means to her.'Kayleigh added: 'It makes me feel rather upset, I just wore it to remember my aunt.'","Kayleigh Handshaw excluded from Outwood Academy Portland .

"The heartbroken husband of actress Lynda Bellingham has told how he can’t bear to spend Christmas without his beloved wife, following her tragic death from cancer. Michael Pattemore, 59, has struggled to cope with losing his TV star wife, who died from colon cancer aged 66 in October. The property developer is now planning to travel to Dubai for Christmas, so he doesn’t have to face being at home without her, while her sons Robbie and Michael Peluso plan to do their own thing. Scroll down for videos . Michael Pattemore, 59, plans to travel to Dubai for Christmas following the death of his actress wife Lynda (pictured together above in March this year). He said he can't face staying at home and being on his own . The actress and mother of two (pictured on October 8) passed away from cancer aged 66 in late October . Mr Pattemore, who buried his wife in Crewkerne, Somerset, on November 3 - ten years to the day they met - said he wants to visit Dubai for the festive period because it’s where his wife took him for a surprise birthday trip nine years ago. He told the Sunday Mirror: ‘Whatever I do, wherever I am, I know I am still going to miss her dreadfully. ‘All she wanted at the end was to make one last family Christmas… but that wasn’t to be. ‘I can’t stay at home and be on my own. I want them [her sons] to lead their own lives but it means I am alone and surrounded by reminders of just how much I’ve lost.’ Mr Pattemore, who was a constant presence by his wife’s side as she undertook her final TV interviews and public appearances to say goodbye to her fans, has been busy raising thousands of pounds for Action Against Cancer since his wife’s death on October 19. While he is set to travel to Dubai for the festive period, Lynda’s sons are expected to have Christmas dinner with their father, Lynda’s ex-husband Nunzio Peluso. Michael, 31, is then expected to stay in London for the remainder of the Christmas period, while hotel manager Robbie, 26, is set to visit family friends in Wales. The trio opted to do their own thing for Christmas this year, after deciding it would be too difficult to spend it together without Lynda. ‘I think we all need a change of scenery this year,’ Michael said. Lynda's husband Michael Pattemore (left) is planning to spend Christmas in Dubai so he doesn't have to face being at home without her. Christopher Biggins (right), a close friend of the actress, supports his decision . Lynda, a former star of TV show Loose Women, pictured alongside Coleen Nolan and Janet Street-Porter . Lynda's husband Michael Pattemore (left) and son Michael Peluso carry her coffin into the church ahead of her funeral  in Crewkerne, Somerset, on November 3. The funeral came ten years after Lynda met Michael . In a previous interview with Yours magazine, Robbie said: ‘Mum always made Christmas very, very special for us. We’ll all miss her so much.’ And Michael added: ‘You can decorate the house, have a lovely tree and all the presents in the world but without mum it’s all just stuff. She turned stuff into magic.' Lynda, who was diagnosed with cancer in July last year, had hoped to spend one last Christmas with her family, before stopping chemotherapy in order to pass away in January. She made the decision in August to end her treatment to limit the amount of suffering her family would witness. However, the advanced state of her illness meant she was unable to die at home in the new year as she had dearly wished. Actor Christopher Biggins, who knew Lynda for 35 years and describes her as a ‘dear friend’ and ‘very special person’, said he could understand why her family wanted to get away for Christmas. He told The Sunday People: ‘Michael isn’t looking forward to Christmas knowing they won’t be celebrating together. ‘It would be painful for him to stay in London and spend the festive season without Lynda. ‘Lynda was a massive fan of Christmas. I think Lynda’s two sons will do their own things – they have their own friends and family. But Michael feels that he needs to be away from all the painful memories and he deserves that.’ In her last few weeks, before she died in the arms of her husband, Lynda spoke openly about her illness and its effect on her family. The mother of two was awarded an OBE in the New Year Honours list for her charity work. She is pictured with her husband Michael (together centre), sons Michael and Robbie Peluzo (left) and step-son Bradley . The actress starred in the Oxo adverts in the 1980s, which are set to return to honour her this Christmas . The actress, whose sister Barbara died from lung cancer, had been a high-profile supporter of Cancer Research UK and Macmillan Cancer Support. Her acting career included the title role in sitcom Faith In The Future and regular stage roles. The mother-of-two also appeared as the mother in a squabbling family in the Oxo adverts in the 1980s, and was awarded an OBE in the New Year Honours list for her charity work. The advert is set to make a return to TV screens this Christmas, after more than 150,000 fans joined a campaign to bring back the classic stock cube advert - to pay tribute to Lynda’s wish for one last Christmas. The actress was also a regular on panel show Loose Women, and filmed a special farewell episode where she spoke about her illness. More than two million viewers tuned in to the show last month to watch her final interview in a special farewell edition, recorded just days before her death. She was given a standing ovation as she entered the studio and told her co-stars how she wished to be remembered. Prior to her death, she also released an autobiography, There's Something I've Been Dying to Tell You, in which she openly discussed her illness. It sold thousands of copies in the days after her death and has since topped several best-sellers list. Figures from her publisher show the book sold 35,084 copies in the week after her death, more than double the next highest selling non-fiction hardback.","Michael Pattemore, 59, grieving following death of beloved wife Lynda, 66 .

"Since her marriage to Prince William in April 2011 Kate Middleton has become known around the world as the Duchess of Cambridge. But now one historian, who has avidly studied Kate's royal's family tree, claims that the 32-year-old could well have the wrong title. Michael Reed, an Australian historian, believes that the new mother could lay claim to the title of Duchess of Oxford thanks to her strong links to the city. Has she got the wrong title? A historian claims that the Duchess of Cambridge could be named the Duchess of Oxford because her ancestors all studied there . Mr Reed, a history lecturer at Hallam Senior College in Melbourne, has long had an interest in the future Queen, who recently announced she was pregnant with her second child. He began researching her ancestors because he wanted to prove claims that she was a 'commoner' wrong. During his extensive research, he discovered that the 32-year-old's grandfather, Peter Middleton, as well as other relatives, all studied at the esteemed Oxford University. Speaking to the Oxford Mail, he said: 'We’ve done a lot of research in the past few months which suggests that when Kate does eventually get to Oxford she should be called the Duchess of Oxford because many of her family studied there. 'I would say that there is a stronger argument for Kate to have been given an Oxford title.' Mr Reed, who is penning a book based on his research, discovered that Kate’s grandfather studied English at New College in 1939, before leaving to train as a pilot during the Second World War. Wrong city? Michael Reed believes that the new mother could lay claim to the title of Duchess of Oxford thanks to her strong links to the city, pictured . Fate? Mr Reed discovered that Kate's grandfather, Peter Middleton, left, as well as other relatives, all studied at the esteemed Oxford University - and later worked as Prince Philip’s co-pilot on their two-month South American tour . In 1962, he found himself working as Prince Philip’s co-pilot on their two-month South American tour. And it wasn't just Kate's grandfather, who passed away in 2010, who has links to Oxford. Mr Reed has revealed that Mr Middleton's great-great-grandfather’s brother, Dr James Martineau, was principal of Harris Manchester College in Oxford, as was Mr Middleton's great-grandfather's brother, Joseph Lupton Esq. Mr Middleton’s great-uncle, the Rt Hon Lord Mayor Hugh Lupton, also attended University College. Big day: Kate Middleton left behind her commoner roots and her name became Her Royal Highness the Duchess of Cambridge when she married William in 2011 . Aubrey de Vere was the last Earl of Oxford back in 1703. Mr Reed added: 'Given that she’s going to be the Queen of Australia at some point, we might as well get the background right.' Kate Middleton left behind her commoner roots and her name became Her Royal Highness the Duchess of Cambridge when she married William in 2011. She also became Kate the Countess of Strathearn and Baroness Carrickfergus – though the titles are used only rarely, mainly in Scotland, where they met and fell in love, and Northern Ireland respectively. Baby on board: Earlier this month, the country rejoiced when it was announced that the Duchess of Cambridge is pregnant again . All titles are gifts from the Queen, but Her Majesty conferred them following private discussions with her grandson and his bride. The Duke of Cambridge has been a royal title since the reign of Charles II. The first Duke of Cambridge was a Stuart prince who only lived for a few months, followed by others who were styled with title but also died very young. George, Elector of Hanover, also held the title and went on to become King George II. He was the last English monarch to lead his troops into battle - at Dettingen in 1743. The title - a popular name for pubs -  links William to the city  where his father, the Prince of Wales, went to university. Earlier this month, the country rejoiced when it was announced that the Duchess of Cambridge is pregnant again. But the spare is proving as troublesome for the Duchess as the heir - Kensington Palace officials were forced to announce the pregnancy early because Kate, right, is suffering from severe hyperemesis gravidarum.","Michael Reed, an Australian historian, makes claim .

"In one panoramic, you can witness two of the main reasons Manchester United versus Liverpool remains the fiercest rivalry in England. Observing Old Trafford from the west, Salford Quays is to your left, and the Sir Alex Ferguson stand to your right. It takes 15 minutes to walk from one to the other. The Manchester Ship Canal (which runs through the Quays) and United’s most successful manager have done most to trigger and accentuate the sharp edge between these clubs. Steven Gerrard and Wayne Rooney lead their sides on Sunday in the biggest rivalry in English football . Sir Alex Ferguson celebrates Manchester United's 1999 Champions League triumph with his team . Steven Gerrard holds the 2005 Champions League trophy aloft after Liverpool beat AC Milan in Istanbul . In the 1800s Liverpool thrived as a port to goods around the globe, while the textile boom saw Manchester evolve hugely. But Manchester’s business community grew frustrated at the charges placed by Liverpool’s docks – so the canal was constructed to bypass those gatekeepers and bring transportation boats inland. Jobs were lost in Liverpool and a feud between cities begun. Football has always been a lens through which such differences could be tribally exhibited. Both teams experienced success after the Second World War. United landed the first European Cup for an English side in 1968, but Liverpool raised that continental triumph with four of their own as they dominated English football in the 1970s and 80s. Thousands of fans line Lime Street in Liverpool as they wait for 2005's Champions League-winning Reds . Liverpool captain Emlyn Hughes, Jimmy Case and Phil Neal hold their European Cup trophy in Rome . Paddy Crerand, Matt Busby and Bobby Charlton celebrate Man United's 1968 European Cup triumph .

United fans proclaim their team 'Kings of Football' after they conquered Europe for the first time . When Ferguson came south of the border, United trailed Liverpool 16 titles to seven; the Liver bird was crowing. United had held their own in one-off matches against Liverpool throughout the Merseysiders’ supremacy – but any fleeting moments of exultation shrunk with each bit of lost silverware. Liverpool bossed it. Ferguson changed all that. Two more titles went Liverpool’s way before the great Scot finally got the top-flight crown back to Old Trafford in 1993. Manager Bob Paisley holds the European Cup as the team parades through Liverpool in 1978 . Tommy Smith and Ian Callaghan with Liverpool's 1977 European Cup won over Borussia Mönchengladbach . Ferguson and Liverpool's Jonjo Shelvey argue after the now Swansea man was sent off in 2012 . Ferguson shouts and gesticulates during the FA Cup fifth round clash with Liverpool in 2006 . The pursuit had started and the rivalry increased. As United edged closer to that total hanging like a gilded carrot, it meant these two clubs in the North West separated by 30 miles moved clear at the top of English football history. In that rarefied air, it became an intense duel throughout the 90s and 2000s. Liverpool supporters gloated about their overall advantage, but United fans revelled as the gap closed. Like a barge slicing through the landscape, they eased towards 18 and drew alongside in 2009. In 2011, United went ahead and with Ferguson’s final title made it 20, as fans have dedicated in song. Liverpool still hold the upperhand on European Cups, 5-3, and do not fail to remind their adversaries.

At times the rivalry has frothed into the grotesque. United fans singing about Hillsborough, Liverpool about Munich and other instances beside. Then there is softer bravado over which city has the better music, comedy and fashion. But the strongest theme is football success, as Ferguson’s eminent quote pertains. In September 2002, amid his team’s struggles and Arsenal’s superiority, he showed the undercurrent that had driven him all along. Responding to Alan Hansen’s suggestion he was going through his greatest challenge, Ferguson said: ‘My greatest challenge was knocking Liverpool right off their f****** perch… And you can print that.’","Manchester United and Liverpool clash on Sunday at Old Trafford .

"Amir Khan is thinking globally rather than nationally after beating Devon Alexander in Las Vegas. There was no middleweight world title on offer for the Bolton man but his slick points win means he can consider himself a strong contender to face unbeaten American Floyd Mayweather in 2015. Khan has long sought the fight but now, after impressing in Vegas, can offer a genuine case for the match being made. If he cannot meet Mayweather he is eyeing former stablemate Manny Pacquiao. Amir Khan is aiming high for his next bout after dominating Devon Alexander in Las Vegas . Khan on his way to a unanimous points decision against Alexander at the MGM Grand Garden Arena . The Briton celebrates his victory and later made his desire to take on Floyd Mayweather Jr clear . Either of those would mean there will be no domestic grudge match with IBF champion Kell Brook next, but Khan wants to cash in while his stock is high. 'If Mayweather doesn't happen, Manny Pacquiao is a great name,' he told BBC Radio Five Live. 'We trained together, there's a great storyline there. With Kell Brook, that fight will always be there but at the moment I want to catch the right guys because how long are they going to be in boxing for? They're at the top of their game.' Khan wants Floyd Mayweather Jr as his next opponent but failing that he'd take on Manny Pacquiao . Marcos Maidana (right) was the 46th and 47th victim in Mayweather's so far unbeaten career . Khan is targeting a May 2 date with Mayweather, who has not lost in 47 fights. 'This puts me in a great position to fight the biggest names of boxing; Mayweather, Pacquiao. That's where I belong and today (Alexander) was a great statement,' he added. 'Everybody now wants that fight (against Mayweather). 'The public demand, Golden Boy (Khan's promoters) were saying they want that fight with Mayweather. It's up to him, the ball is in his court. 'It's the fight the fans want, why don't we get it done now? I'm only getting better, I am hitting my peak. I can't wait to show the world what I have.' Khan already did that in the early hours of Sunday. Mayweather is trying to make a long-awaited fight happen with Manny Pacquiao . Should Khan not be able to make the Mayweather bout happen, he wants to take on Pacquiao . He controlled the fight from the start, using his superior speed to stay ahead of Alexander and out-punching his American opponent who could do nothing to change the rhythm as the night went on. Khan's performance was reflected in a comfortable win, with the fight scored 119-109, 118-110, 120-108 - the 30th win of his professional career. The match-up had been billed as a 50/50 contest, but Khan had other ideas as he controlled the flow of the fight and knocked Alexander off his game. Kell Brook has said Khan should be taking him on in an all-Britain grudge match . Khan says Brook will always be there but there is a limited time frame on Mayweather and Pacquiao . Wearing his specially-designed shorts encrusted with 24-carat gold, Khan ruled the ring as he was able to have the final word in almost every round. Alexander could not make his jabs count, with Khan's carefully-timed flurries making much the bigger impact. Khan was quick and hard with his punches, and Alexander was put on the defensive with his frustration - and that of his corner - clear as the rounds went by. It was not until the eighth that Alexander landed anything to bring him encouragement, but Khan immediately responded with a big counter-punch.

Alexander, desperate for any momentum, attacked in the 10th but Khan responded with a series of huge blows and Alexander looked resigned to defeat well before the end.

"Rickie Lambert does not need to take a polygraph test to verify how much he is hurting after Liverpool’s Champions League exit. It is etched all over the striker’s face as he talks about the need to put things right against Manchester United on Sunday. Lambert knows his emotional return to Anfield this season, 17 years after he was rejected as a Liverpool trainee, has not been a triumphant homecoming so far. Like the club’s season in general, Lambert is in the middle of an anguished spell, which reached its low point on Tuesday night when he was substituted at half-time against Basel and forced to watch centre-back Martin Skrtel operate as a target man in his absence. Rickie Lambert accepts that his move to boyhood club Liverpool has not been a success . Lambert and Steven Gerrard (right) look on after conceding during Champions League elimination to Basle . Liverpool players try and raise the spirits in training ahead of their clash with Manchester United . To be fair to the 32-year-old, he does not try to hide his pain, nor the team’s, after a 1-1 draw that saw them eliminated from the elite competition and consigned to the Europa League. ‘The mood was down when we got back into training on Thursday and we have been trying to get the spirits going again, put everything to bed and get fired up for the United game,’ said Lambert. ‘Everyone in that dressing room is hurting just as much as me. It wasn’t nice. ‘We’ve just got to look forward to Sunday now. Obviously there’s more pressure on us to get the win. If we can’t get up for this, we can’t get up for any game.’ It was not meant to be like this. Lambert’s £4million move from Southampton was one of the feelgood stories of the summer. He was the Kirkby boy who left Liverpool at 15 to work in a beetroot factory and start a new playing career in the lower leagues with Macclesfield, Stockport and Rochdale. The 32-year-old's form for Southampton earned his a dream move to Anfield in the summer . Lambert reacts after missing a chance against Sunderland, the England striker has only netted twice this term . Eventually, he ended up getting a fairytale move back to Liverpool as one of nine signings made by manager Brendan Rodgers to offset the loss of Luis Suarez to Barcelona in the summer. But the reality has well and truly kicked in now with Liverpool’s top-four challenge faltering on a lack of goals, with Lambert and Mario Balotelli held chiefly responsible. Lambert has scored just twice all season while Liverpool’s leading Premier League scorers — Raheem Sterling and Steven Gerrard — have managed only three goals apiece. To put those statistics into context, Suarez hit four goals in one game against Norwich last winter. ‘All those cliches and thoughts of living the dream quickly got eradicated a few months after I joined,’ said Lambert. ‘Just because I’m a Liverpool fan doesn’t mean it’s nice when we’re not playing or not winning. It’s probably worse. ‘It’s hurting me personally and I have to try to get it out of my system. Let me be a player. A few of us didn’t play that well on Tuesday and we want to try to rectify it.’ Losing Luis Suarez to Barcelona appears to have effectively ended Liverpool's hopes of a title challenge . Mario Balotelli may be smiling during training but the Italian firebrand has come under intense criticism . The good news for Rodgers, also under pressure with many of his signings struggling, is that Lambert has been here before. Right at the start of his career, he signed for Stockport from Macclesfield in a £300,000 deal that represented a lot of money for the club, and scored only twice in 32 games in his first season there. He said: ‘I’ve had a lot of experiences that will help me. I’ve always believed in my ability and that I can score goals. I’m more than confident that I can start scoring. ‘I’ve been doing well in the last month, though I didn’t have a good game the other night. I know I can do better. ‘As a team, I wouldn’t judge us too quickly. Wait until Danny Sturridge is back and all our signings have completely gelled, then judge us. I believe we will start going on a run. Lambert hopes that his experience will get him through this lean spell in front of goal . The Reds are missing main striker Mario Balotelli who has been sidelined with a long-term injury . ‘Common sense tells you if you’re looking at an entirely new back four and an entirely new attacking line, it is mistaken to think we would carry on the same as last year or anywhere near it. It was always going to take time.’ As a boyhood fan, it is inevitable today’s trip to Old Trafford — regarded by Koppites as the biggest match of the season — will be special. Lambert was in the crowd when United won the 1996 FA Cup final and Liverpool’s players were dubbed ‘Spice Boys’ for wearing white Armani suits as they strolled around Wembley before kick-off. ‘It’s a fixture I’ve always watched. It’s brilliant — the atmosphere, the intensity of the game,’ he said. ‘There’s a lot of respect but a bit of hatred as well. ‘It’s everything we want in a game. Two good teams, two top clubs going head to head. I’m looking forward to it. Gerrard celebrates scoring during Liverpool's 3-0 victory at Old Trafford last season . Lambert recalls Eric Cantona's winner against his club in the 1996 FA Cup final at Wembley . ‘I went to Wembley when Cantona scored the winner. I’ve been to a few at Anfield as well but I’m trying not to look at it as a fan any more. I’ve got a job to do whether I’m starting or on the bench. ‘We’ve got to be very respectful of the attacking aspect of United. They’ve got one of the best in the country, but we’ve got to feel confident that we can attack them, too. We’re different as well so we’ve got to go there with a game plan.’ Last March, Liverpool beat United 3-0 at Old Trafford. Lambert, then a Southampton player, recalls being ‘animated’ as he watched on television. This time the game means even more, as a player rather than a fan.","Liverpool face Manchester United in the Premier League on Sunday .

The class assignment also revealed that the Duchess' second cousin - thrice removed - is Newnham College graduate Lady Barbara Bullock. Mr Reed traced the Duchess's family line back five generations to the Marquess of Lansdowne and his brother Thomas FitzMaurice who lived at the Buckinghamshire stately home Cliveden with his wife Mary, 4th Countess of Orkney in the late 18th century.

Speaking with her husband, John, she revealed that she was diagnosed with the disorder after the birth of her first child. Scroll down for video . Rare disorder: In the documentary 100 Orgasms A Day, Rachel explains that she must constantly exercise strict control over her body to prevent herself from climaxing . She explains in the documentary 100 Orgasms A Day, which aired in the UK on Pick TV last night, that she must exercise strict control over her body to prevent herself from climaxing. 'If I wasn’t controlling it, I don’t even know if I could put a number on . it. It would be in the hundreds,' she says. 'They come every 30 seconds for four to six [or] sometimes eight hours, and I'm sure that's well up in the hundreds - I'm not a math person, but I'm sure it's up there. 'If I had no self-control, no willpower, I don’t know that I would ever leave the house.' 'If I had no self-control, no willpower, I don't know that I would ever leave the house' Even simple household tasks pose a hazard, she admits. 'The washing machine, for whatever reason, when it goes on the spin cycle I don't even like to touch it,' she tells the camera. 'The . vibrations have a tendency to trigger the persistant sexual arousal, . and it'll trigger an episode... I don't sit on it, for obvious reasons. That, I think, would do me in.' For John, there are both positive and negatives to being married to a woman with persistent sexual arousal syndrome. Double-edged sword: For Rachel's husband John, there are both positive and negatives to being married to a woman with persistent sexual arousal syndrome . 'I called it the Horny Toad Disease,' he said, referring to a frog found in America's Southwest. 'It does make for a fun time, because it's not every day that women are aggressive in that way, but . sometimes it is inopportune... 'It's a double-edged sword. You think you . want it, until you have got it.' Being more sexually-charged than her husband has had an emotional impact on Rachel, too, who initially struggled when her husband refused sex. 'At first I took it so horribly,' she admitted. 'When you know that . there's a way to relieve it, and you don't have access to that way... I just let my emotions get the better of me. 'Sometimes I was in tears, I was like, ""You don't really want me,"" and . stuff like that. It was really hard to deal with.' DR DAVID GOLDMEIER, an expert on sexual medicine at Imperial College in London says: . Persistent genital arousal disorder (PGAD) is a newly recognised condition, where the sufferer complains of long periods of genital arousal that are not associated with sexual desire. PGAD sufferers experience intrusive, unsolicited and spontaneous genital arousal that can be unrelenting. This arousal can persist for hours, days or even longer. This can be highly distressing for a woman and despite attempts to relieve it with sexual activity or orgasm, this often doesn't help or can worsen the symptoms. Tarlov cysts are small jelly like cysts that form around the sacral area of the spine. They are a common finding in normal people. One current research paper suggests that a lot of women who have PGAD have Tarlov cysts, but this is contentious. Spontaneous genital arousal is quite common but it's those women who can't control the arousal which is uncommon. I see around 20 women a year with this condition, it may be as common as one in 100 we just don't know. Sometimes it may resolve on its own, there is no cure but there are a number of ways to manage the symptoms such as meditation and pelvic floor exercises along with pain medication for the patient.","Rachel, from Atlanta, Georgia, suffers from persistent sexual arousal syndrome, which means she climaxes hundreds of times a day ."

"Unhappy visit: Mr Thompson at the McDonald's where he was refused service . Alistair Thompson had promised to buy his four-year-old son Edward a McDonald’s meal as a treat. So when he found that his trailer bike was too big for the bicycle rack at his local branch he had what seemed like a bright idea. He rode the bike into the restaurant’s drive-thru. But when he reached the payment window staff refused to serve him, saying that the bike was a health and safety risk and that only motorised vehicles were allowed in the drive-thru. Yesterday Mr Thompson, 35, condemned the ‘daft policy’, which he said showed ‘a complete lack of common sense’. He said: ‘I was out for the day riding with my son in the trailer when he asked if – as a treat – he could have a Happy Meal. I don’t normally go to McDonald’s but I said OK. ‘As the bike has a sizeable trailer on it, it wasn’t suitable for the bike rack and it stuck out too much so I decided to go through the drive-thru.’ The father of two, from Portsmouth, was able to order the meal over an intercom at the drive-thru at the city’s Pompey Centre and waited in the queue of cars for about 15 minutes. But when he eventually reached the payment window on his £600 trailer bike, he was refused service. ‘The staff claimed they couldn’t serve me . because I was not in a motorised vehicle. I asked them why and they . said because of health and safety reasons,’ Mr Thompson said. 'Health and safety': Staff said Mr Thompson could not use the drive-thru because his bike was not a motorised vehicle . ‘I was baffled. If my bike is safe enough for the road, surely it is safe enough for a drive-thru in a car park with a 5mph limit? It’s a daft policy. ‘It struck me as showing a complete lack of common sense, especially as they serve people on mopeds and motorbikes. I was so cross I rang the Health and Safety Executive and they said it was nonsense.’ A motorist ahead of Mr Thompson overheard him being turned away and offered to buy the meal for him but was told by staff that she could not. The father and son decided to leave without the Happy Meal and went to a local restaurant instead. Baffled: Mr Thompson's £600 trailer bike was well within the 5mph speed limit in the car park . Mr Thompson, who runs his own public relations company, plans to write to the branch manager and the fast food chain’s head office to complain. McDonald’s said: ‘It is our policy not to serve cyclists through the drive-thru lanes. They are designed for road-going motor vehicles. ‘The policy takes into account situations in which a cyclist’s safety could be compromised, such as the close proximity with motor vehicles and the limited visibility of cycles, particularly given the sharp corners in some of our drive-thru lanes.’ Truth: Health and Safety Executives said the McDonad's in Portsmouth's Pompey Centre should have explained that it was unsafe to be so close to motor vehicles . But a spokesman for the Health and Safety Executive said there was no legislation preventing cyclists from using a drive-thru. ‘McDonald’s should state the real reason for turning away cyclists rather than using health and safety as a catch-all,’ he added. This is not the first time staff at the chain have refused to serve customers citing health and safety reasons. Last month it apologised for turning away grandmother Kate Legg, 76, who tried to order a milk shake from her mobility scooter at a drive-thru in Bedhampton, Hampshire. No serve: Mr Thompson and Edward decided to go to a local restaurant instead .","Restaurant refused service as not in 'motorised vehicle'

"Father set fire to himself when military delivered news of eldest son's death . When Carlos Arredondo heard of the death of his eldest son, 20-year-old  Lance Corporal Alexander Arredondo, while serving in Iraq in 2004, the grief-stricken father almost took his own life. He was dealt another devastating blow, when his second son Brian, 24, committed suicide just before Christmas as the final troops withdrew from the war which killed his brother. Brian Arredondo, of Boston, had suffered with depression and battled drug addiction ever since Alexander's death. Double tragedy: Marine Lance Corporal Alexander Arredondo (left) was killed in Iraq in 2004. His brother Brian took his own life last month after struggling to deal with his elder brother's death . Grief: Brian Arredondo (left) joins his father Carlos as they attend a memorial for his brother Alexander who was killed in the Iraq war. Brian took his own life just before Christmas . Their father Carlos Arredondo, 51, told the Boston Herald: 'We are broken hearts.' His son Brian had attended grief counseling following the death of his older brother and had previously attempted suicide in 2006. He died on December 19. Melida Arredondo, Brian's stepmother, told Wicked Local Roslindale: 'He died (close to) the last day of the . war in Iraq and his brother was not coming home… we’re not sure but we . think that contributed.' The young man's funeral took place on December 28 at St Thomas Aquinas Parish and he was later laid to rest next to his brother at   Rural Cemetery in Walpole. In 2004, when the military arrived at his Roslindale home to tell Mr Arredondo of his son Alexander's death, he almost died when he set fire to himself as he tried to destroy their van in anguish.

The native of Costa Rica was helped obtain U.S. citizenship by the late Senator Edward . Kennedy and is regularly seen at anti-war rallies, holding his son's desert boots and dog tags. 'Ever since his brother died, he had a very hard time. He was tortured. Just tortured.' Victoria Foley, mother of Brian Arredondo, who took his own life . The boys' mother Victoria Foley told the Boston Herald her sons 'were joined at the hip. And ever since his brother died, he had a very hard time. He was tortured. Just tortured'. Alexander Arredondo joined the Marines aged 17 after they recruited him in high school, offering him help with college tuition in return. After basic training in California, he was deployed to Iraq in 2004. On August 25, 2004, the day of his 44th birthday, Carlos Arredondo was working in his front yard when van of Marines turned up to inform him that his  son had been killed in action.

Overwhelmed with grief, he grabbed a five-gallon can of gasoline and a torch from his garage and doused the van, setting fire to himself in the process. He suffered burns to 26 per cent of his body and attended his son Alexander's funeral on a stretcher. Mr Arredondo told The Nation in 2006: 'Wanting to reach him I was lifted off the stretcher... I lay on top of the casket, on top of my son, apologizing to him because I did nothing for him to avoid this moment. Nothing.'

"Scroll down for video . These stark aerial images show how dozens of homes in southern California were buried under unstoppable rock and mudslides this weekend. The community of Camarillo Springs, north of Los Angeles, was hit hard as boulder-strewn rivers of mud swept down hillsides that a wildfire had stripped of vegetation last year. The rocks and roots pushed into bedrooms, straight on through to the living room, cracking front windows. An earthmover that had been brought in ahead of the storm to clear debris was buried as well, with just its big mechanical arm left sticking up out of the muck. 'It's $200,000 (of equipment) sitting under there,' said heavy equipment mechanic Tony Morris. 'It was good at 11:30 when I left last night.' These stark aerial images show how dozens of homes in southern California were buried under unstoppable rock and mudslides this weekend . One of the areas hardest hit on Friday was the community of Camarillo Springs, north of Los Angeles, where boulder-strewn rivers of mud swept down hillsides that a wildfire had stripped of vegetation last year . The rocks and roots pushed into bedrooms, straight on through to the living room, cracking front windows . Ten homes in the community surrounding a golf course 50 miles northwest of Los Angeles, were red-tagged, indicating they were uninhabitable and off-limits, according to the Ventura County Fire Department. Three homes were yellow-tagged, meaning they were uninhabitable but residents could enter to retrieve items. Another three had lesser damage. About 1,000 homes were placed under evacuation orders in the Los Angeles suburb of Glendora, where mudslides from a wildfire-burned area there left several roads impassable overnight, police Lieutenant Matt Williams said. 'It's amazing how much rock actually slid down the hill,' said sheriff's Capt. Don Aguilar. Former Republican Rep. Elton Gallegly told KCAL-TV his house was destroyed by the debris flow.

'It's quite an earth-moving operation,' said Elton Gallegly, whose wife's family owns one of the damaged homes and who stopped by Saturday to check on progress. Gallegly, a former congressman, said work crews using a huge backhoe and several other vehicles told him they hoped to clear the road in front of the houses by dark. Though he was impressed by the 'incredible progress,' he thought that timeline was ambitious - and it still wouldn't mean the removal of tons of muck surrounding the homes. The neighborhood's trouble was rooted in a fire that erupted nearby along U.S. 101 on May 2, 2013, as a dry and gusty Santa Ana wind pushed back moist breezes from the nearby ocean, sent humidity plunging to withering levels and fanned flames across the west end of the Santa Monica Mountains. About 2,000 homes were threatened by flames and 15 sustained damage, but none was destroyed. When it was over, the fire had burned to the beach at Point Mugu and 44 square miles of rugged terrain were left devoid of protective vegetation. Ted and Rita Elliot placed 400 sandbags around the back of their Camarillo Springs home and it was spared. On Friday they stood in their backyard looking at destruction next door.

The Pacific storm pounded Southern California with heavy rain and high winds on Friday, triggering a small tornado, flash floods and mudslides that prompted the evacuation of hundreds of homes, damaged dozens of others and disrupted passenger rail services along the coast. One person was found dead on Friday in a rain-swollen flood-control channel in the Orange County town of Garden Grove, which could mark the third storm-related fatality on the West Coast since Thursday. Separately, rescue teams saved two people after they were swept away in the fast-moving Los Angeles River near a homeless encampment, the Los Angeles Fire Department said in Twitter messages. High winds tore down power lines throughout the region, leaving as many as 78,000 customers without electricity at one point after the storm moved in before dawn, utility officials reported. In an unusual phenomenon for Southern California, a small tornado touched down in South Los Angeles, where it damaged the roofs of an apartment complex and two houses and ripped up a billboard, said National Weather Service Specialist Stuart Seto. The twister was an EF0, the smallest category possible, and no one was hurt, he said.

The same storm pummeled the Pacific Northwest and the northern half of California on Thursday with downpours and gale-force gusts that caused widespread power outages and disrupted commercial flights in San Francisco. The highest rainfall measured was at San Marcos Pass, just north of Santa Barbara, where more than 5 inches (12 cm) fell. Downtown Los Angeles had more than 1.5 inches (3.8 cm) of rain. Harsh weather was blamed for two deaths on Thursday in Oregon. In southern Oregon near Ashland, a homeless man camping with his 18-year-old son was killed when a tree toppled onto their tent. Portland police said a tree fell on a car that then swerved into another tree, killing a boy who was a passenger. It was not known whether the body in Garden Grove was a weather-related fatality or a victim who died of some other cause and was washed into the flood channel, officials said. The storm was expected to provide little relief from the multi-year drought that has forced sharp cutbacks in irrigation supplies to farmers and conservation measures across California.","Mudslides damaged dozens of homes and forced hundreds of people to evacuate in Camarillo Springs .

But the three ringside judges all saw the fight differently with Julie Lederman scoring it 116-112 for Chaves, Burt Clements 115-113 for Bradley while Craig Metcalfe had 114-114, a draw, meaning the fight was called a tie.

"A 'superfan' of  Charles Manson appears to have carried out her vow to marry the 80-year-old notorious mass murderer. Afton Elaine Burton, who calls herself Star, was spotted outside her home on Saturday proudly flaunting a new ring on her wedding finger. The 26-year-old has been writing to the killer since she was a teen and even moved from her home in Illinois to the California town where he is imprisoned. Scroll down for video . Newlywed? Charles Manson's girlfriend Afton Elaine Burton was seen outside her Corcoran, California home on Saturday wearing a band on her ring finger, suggesting the couple had tied the knot . Taken: Manson and his 26-year-old girlfriend were approved for a marriage license last month, which gave them 90 days to carry out their jailhouse ceremony . Wedding bells: California Department of Corrections spokesman Jeffrey Callison previously stated that the wedding would have to take place on a visiting day, which happen on Saturdays, Sundays and certain holidays (including Thanksgiving) Separated: Manson will not be allowed to consummate his marriage, since he is serving a life in prison sentence. Above, Burton is seen out with a friend on Saturday . May-December: Burton, who goes by the name 'Star', first met Manson as a teen when she started writing to him behind bars. She moved to Corcoran, California at the age of 18 to be nearer to him . The couple filed for a marriage license on November 7, which gave them just 90 days to carry out the nuptials. Calls to the California State Prison were not immediately returned Sunday morning. California Department of Corrections spokesman Jeffrey Callison previously stated that the wedding would have to take place on a visiting day, which happen on Saturdays, Sundays and certain holidays (including Thanksgiving). Callison said the couple would be allowed 10 guests from outside the prison, two guests from inside the prison and an officiant of their own choosing. However, the two are not be allowed to consummate their marriage since Manson's life in prison sentence bans him from receiving conjugal visits. In previous interviews, Star gushed about falling in love with Manson and his 'philosophy' as a teen, and how she already considered herself married to him. Behind bars: Manson has spent the last four decades in prison after being found guilty of participating in seven murders in 1969 . 'I'm completely with him, and he's completely with me. It's what I was born for, you know. I don't know what else to say,' she told CNN in August. Manson has been in prison for the last four decades, after he and four disciples of his doomsday cult carried out a series of murders in 1969. One of their victims was Roman Polanski's actress wife Sharon Tate, who was butchered to death in her upscale southern California home when she was eight and a half months pregnant. Manson and his disciples were initially sentenced to death, but later had those sentences commuted to life in prison. In 2012, he applied and was denied parole, and cannot apply again until 2027 which means the couple have little chance of living together in matrimony. Manson has been married twice before, first to Rosalie Jean Willis from 1955 to 1958 and then to Candy Stevens from 1959 to 1963. Star has also been compared to one of Manson's disciples Susan Atkins, known as 'Sexy Sadie', who was also convicted of participating in eight of the August 1969 killings. Manson and his 'Family' of disciples carried out a series of murders in August 1969, which they thought would bring about a 'Helter Skelter' race war. The murders were centered on affluent Los Angeles neighborhoods, which they tried to pin on African American. Killer likeness: Burton's (right) looks have been compared to one of Manson's 'Family' membersSusan Atkins (left), who was  convicted of participating in eight of the August 1969 killings . Not ok: Star's father Phil Burton (pictured) previously spoke out to MailOnline to say he does not approve of the marriage and will not be attending the jailhouse ceremony . Star's father Phil Burton spoke exclusively with MailOnline in July, to describe the moment his daughter called to announce her engagement. 'Daddy I'm getting married to Charlie,' Star gushed to her 45-year-old father. Mr Burton, of Bunker Hill, Illinois, said that while he loves his daughter, he would not be attending her wedding and does not support her relationship with Manson. ‘We have not, we are not going to and we never will, no matter what she does in her life, disown our daughter. I love my kids more than life itself. I love my daughter, my wife loves my daughter and I know she still loves us,' Mr Burton told MailOnline. Mr Burton revealed that his daughter first discovered Manson in high school, when a friend profiled the mass-murderer for a school project. ‘This particular friend of hers got hold of a lot of pro Manson literature. She’s a kid. She didn’t dig. She didn’t research. She’s just wanting to do her paper. And it had a lot to do with what he’s doing now with ATWA (Air Trees Water Animals and All the Way Alive),' Mr Burton said. Mr Burton says his young daughter was drawn to ATWA and its naturalistic ideals, which led her to first reach out to Manson through letters. However, Mr Burton says he was not aware of his daughter's first contact with Manson, and would have stopped the correspondence had he known. ‘If I could have shut it down when it started, of course I would have. But we couldn’t. She was already 18 by the time we found out,' he said. Mr Burton also revealed his opinion about Manson, who he has spoken to over the phone. ‘I’ve talked with him and I don’t mean this as an insult, it’s an observation, I think maybe there’s been a bit of Napoleon syndrome over the years. He’s not a tall man and perhaps he’s made up for that by becoming this big personality,' he said. While Mr Bruton is troubled by his daughter's fascination with Manson, he says he is comforted by the fact that Manson will be behind bars for their marriage. ‘It’s never going to be able to come to fruition. It’s never going to develop into a full blown relationship and I think that may be a part of what eases me a little as a parent,' he said.

"ABC News host Elizabeth Vargas is being helped through her recovery from alcohol addiction and impending divorce from her husband of 12 years by a former colleague. Vargas, who returned to working on 20/20 two months ago after entering rehab for a second time in August, is reported to be seeing former ABC News executive vice president Dave Davis as she continues her fight to maintain sobriety and finalizes her split from songwriter Marc Cohn. Davis is now general manager at local New York news station WABC-TV and he and Vargas, 52, have been seen out in the city together. Scroll down for video . Elizabeth Vargas, pictured here on October 14, is reported to be seeing former ABC News executive vice president Dave Davis as she continues her fight to maintain sobriety and finalizes her divorce . A source told the New York Post that Davis is a ‘treasured friend’ who has known Vargas for a long time because they both work at ABC News. ‘Elizabeth has been going through a difficult time in her life, and they are not dating. She is focused on her sobriety and recovery and is not ready for a new relationship,’ said the source. Vargas has been very open about her ongoing struggle with alcoholism. In August, the married mother of two checked into a rehabilitation center in California, where she stayed for a week, followed by outpatient treatment. She also had sought treatment for alcohol addiction last November. The veteran 20/20 anchor is also in the process of divorcing her husband of 12 years, songwriter Marc Cohn. The couple have two sons, 10-year-old Zachary and Samuel, aged seven. Cohn's spokeswoman told MailOnline in October that 'The split took place last winter, and it is amicable. Both parties are devoted parents and are committed to putting the boys first.' Vargas and husband Marc Cohn are going through divorce mediation, but papers have not yet been signed . The Post reports that the ex-couple are going through divorce mediation, but papers have not yet been signed. Cohn - who is best known for his Grammy-winning song Walking In Memphis - has remained supportive of Vargas despite their split and rumors that he cheated with a mutual friend, which he denied. After his wife entered rehab, Cohn released a statement. 'On behalf of Elizabeth's family,' the 55-year-old wrote, 'we are in total support of her recovery and want her to be well.' In November 2013, Elizabeth announced she had battled her addiction for a decade, and admitted it had taken her years to admit she is an alcoholic. Cohn . was the only one who knew about Vargas' struggles with alcohol for many year and when he . finally confronted her, the ABC anchor recalled feeling 'really angry' while acknowledging that he was right. Vargas and Cohn have two sons, Zachary and Samuel, from their 12 year marriage . Vargas took to Twitter in October to let her fans know that she was returning to the anchor's chair on 20/20 . When . asked about the cause of her addiction, Vargas revealed that she has . been suffering from severe anxiety since she was a little girl and dealt with the stress by drinking. Her father served in the Vietnam War in the 1960s, and she recalled that when her mother would leave the house to go to work, she suffered daily panic attacks that carried into adulthood. Vargas said it took her a long time to seek treatment because she didn't want to feel like a failure and was still able to function in her daily life. She recalled that her ‘aha' moment came one day when she arrived at work to film a 20/20 segment and realized that she was too drunk to do it. Vargas is a well-respected television journalist who got her start at . Chicago's WBBM before joining NBC News in 1993 as a correspondent for Dateline. Vargas has been suffering from severe anxiety since she was a little girl and dealt with the stress by drinking . She was named co-anchor alongside David Muir of ABC's investigative news program 20/20 in 2004. The New Jersey native won an Emmy in 1999 for her coverage of the Elian Gonzalez immigration case. Earlier this year she signed a new contract with ABC. A spokesperson for the network said: 'We're behind Elizabeth 100 per cent, she's taking the time to do the work she needs to do.' In October she announced via Twitter that she was returning to the anchor's chair on 20/20 after completing a treatment program for alcohol addiction. 'So many thx to everyone for your support! It means so much. I am back to work next week, so happy to come back!' Vargas wrote. Elizabeth Vargas appeared on 'Good Morning America' in January to publicly discuss for the first time her addiction to alcohol, which she had been keeping a secret for many years. 'I am an alcoholic,' Vargas told George Stephanopoulos. 'It took me a long time to admit that to myself. It took me a long time to admit it to my family, but I am.' ‘You become so isolated with the secret and so lonely, because you can’t tell anyone what’s happening,’ she explained. ‘I started thinking “Well, you know, I’ll only drink, you know, on weekends,” she said with a laugh. ‘I’ll only drink, you know, two glasses of wine a night. I won’t drink on nights before I have to get up and do “Good Morning America.” But those deals never work.’ Vargas used wine to treat her anxiety and deal with the stresses of her work. ‘That’s exhausting, to live like that. And it becomes very easy to think “I deserve this glass of wine. I’m so stressed out …,”’ she said. When Vargas finally decided to enter rehab, she and her husband told their sons that she was suffering from an alcohol allergy. ‘I didn’t want to use the word “disease” with them, even though that’s how it’s classified by the medical profession,’ she said. ‘It’s too scary, you know, the connotation for them is disease is something deadly.’ Vargas admitted that even now it is hard for her not to drink, but she has been relying on prayers, meditation and a great support system to conquer her urges triggered by stress. ‘There are lots of people who feel a lot of stress,’ she said. ‘Not everybody turns to a glass of wine or three like I did, or four, like I did on some occasions. What I learned to do when I was away was to feel the feelings.’ She concluded: 'Alcohol for me is no longer an option.'","Vargas has reportedly been seen out with former ABC News executive vice president Dave Davis .

"A fixture where legends emerge and reputations fall, Manchester United against Liverpool intensifies personal duels and leaves performances lasting the memories. Here, Sportsmail highlights ten heroes from past encounters. Eric Cantona . In exile for nine months over his kung-fu kick, the King returned to Old Trafford on October 1, 1995 for the visit of Liverpool. A sea of flags waved like the Last Night of the Proms – tricolore rather than Union – as the Frenchman stepped out collar up. He set up Nicky Butt’s opening goal, then converted a penalty to steal a point and produce that celebration round the pole. At the end of the season he did it again, winning United the FA Cup with a late volley that defied physics. Eric Cantona announces his comeback following his ban for THAT kung-fu kick by scoring against Liverpool . Cantona's shot from the edge of the box somehow finds its way through the Liverpool defence to win the FA Cup and the Double for Manchester United in 1996 . Cantona is mobbed by David Beckham, Denis Irwin, Nicky Butt and Roy Keane after scoring the winner . Steven Gerrard . No visiting player has scored more often at Old Trafford in the Premier League than Liverpool’s captain, as the camera by the end where away supporters sit is most aware. Kisses to the lens have followed a couple of his five goals. He scored two penalties last season in the 3-0 victory, and another from the spot in the 4-1 win in March 2009 that gave Liverpool hope for the title. He also got a brace in the September 2010 encounter but… . Liverpool's captain marvel Steven Gerrard celebrates scoring at Old Trafford in a 3-0 win last season . Gerrard has made a habit of kissing the TV camera in front of the away end at Old Trafford . Gerrard kisses the badge after converting a penalty in Liverpool's 4-1 win at United in March 2009 . Dimitar Berbatov . … Liverpool failed to win that game because the languid Bulgarian roused himself sufficiently to score a supreme hat-trick. In his finest match for United, Berbatov gave his team a 2-0 lead then won the game when pegged back level with a towering header. His second goal was the pick, a stunning overhead kick that underlined the quality he was capable of. Dimitar Berbatov scores with that unforgettable overhead kick in United's 3-2 win over Liverpool in 2010 . The Bulgarian scored a hat-trick that day in arguably his best performance for United . Fernando Torres . The Spanish striker tormented United pretty much each time he played, especially terrorising Nemanja Vidic. He reduced the great Serb to a Sunday League player, playing a large part in the latter two of his three consecutive red cards in this fixture. Torres scored in three successive games himself, and Vidic breathed a sigh when he moved to Chelsea and his powers deserted. Fernando Torres leaves Nemanja Vidic for dead during Liverpool's 4-1 win at Old Trafford in March 2009 . The Spaniard slides in celebration in front of the away corner at Old Trafford after scoring . Diego Forlan . So fabled for his two goals in the December 2002 game United fans dedicated in song that he ‘came from Uruguay, and made the Scousers cry’. Evidence of said tears has yet to be firmly established but Jerzy Dudek did have head in hands after two howlers. His first mistake allowed Forlan an empty net, and he then let a shot past his near post. United went on to win that season’s title. Diego Forlan capitalises on Jerzy Dudek's mistake to score at Anfield in December 2002, as United won 2-1 . The Uruguayan striker scored twice that afternoon as United claimed a vital win in their title charge . Danny Murphy . Possessed an unrivalled ability in the early 2000s to find one touch to win matches for Liverpool at Old Trafford. In December 2000 he curled a free-kick past Fabian Barthez: 1-0. In January 2002 he converted flicked a finish against the same goalkeeper with five minutes to go: 1-0. In April 2004 he beat Tim Howard from the spot: 1-0. An uncanny knack that has him in Liverpool legend. Danny Murphy celebrates with Igor Biscan and Steven Gerrard after scoring the winner at Old Trafford in 2000 . Laurent Blanc tries in vain to stop Murphy scoring a late Liverpool winner in 2002 . John O’Shea . Orchestrator of the biggest heist the Kop has seen, applying a finishing touch in stoppage time to steal United a win worth more than just three points. United were in contention for their first title in three seasons but wobbling a little. Liverpool dominated the match, and when Paul Scholes was sent off late on looked likely to go ahead. But the sucker punch arrived at the other end when Pepe Reina fumbled Cristiano Ronaldo's free-kick and O’Shea slotted in a goal that galvanised their challenge. John O'Shea (left) scores his last minute winner at Anfield in March 2007 - a big win in their title challenge . O'Shea celebrates with Rio Ferdinand after scoring the vitally important goal at Anfield . Dirk Kuyt . A favourite with Liverpool fans for his work-rate and calmness from the spot, he cemented his status with a hat-trick against the old enemies in March 2011. His was the first three-goal haul for a Liverpool player in this fixture since Peter Beardsley in 1990 but more surprising given the shifting strengths of these teams. United would go on to win the title but Kuyt dealt a hindering blow – converting simple finishes ably assisted by Luis Suarez. Dirk Kuyt celebrates after completing his hat-trick against United in March 2011 . Kuyt thanks Luis Suarez for the assist during Liverpool's 3-1 win at Anfield . Jimmy Greenhoff . Liverpool would have won the treble long before United became the first English team to collect league, FA Cup and European Cup trophies in a single season were it not for Greenhoff’s goal at Wembley. He brought Tommy Docherty’s side the 1977 FA Cup when deflecting Lou Macari's shot off his chest, past Ray Clemence and Phil Neal on the line to delight half the 100,000 crowd. Lou Macari's shot is deflected off Greenhoff's chest and beyond Ray Clemence in the 1977 final . Jimmy Greenhoff (left) celebrates with Brian Greenhoff (right) after United won the Cup in 1977 . Nigel Clough . Down 3-0 at home to a rampant United in January 1994, Liverpool fans were preparing for their most embarrassing evening at Anfield. But Clough rallied to repay his entire £2.3million fee in one go. He snapped a shot from 25 yards to reduce the deficit, then repeated the trick before half-time from closer range to give Liverpool hope.

"The first 'hard evidence' that other universes exist has been found by scientists. Cosmologists studying a map of the universe from data gathered by the Planck spacecraft have concluded that it shows anomalies that can only have been caused by the gravitational pull of other universes. The map shows radiation from the Big Bang 13.8billion years ago that is still detectable in the universe - known as cosmic microwave radiation. Scientists had predicted that it should be evenly distributed, but the map shows a stronger concentration in the south half of the sky and a 'cold spot' that cannot be explained by current understanding of physics. Laura Mersini-Houghton, theoretical physicist at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and Richard Holman, professor at Carnegie Mellon University, predicted that anomalies in radiation existed and were caused by the pull from other universes in 2005. Now that she has studied the Planck data, Dr Mersini-Houghton believes her hypothesis has been proven. Her findings imply there could be an infinite number of universes outside of our own. She said: 'These anomalies were caused by other universes pulling on our universe as it formed during the Big Bang. 'They are the first hard evidence for the existence of other universes that we have seen.' Last year, scientists were able to create a map of light from when the universe was just 380,000 years old . Better quality: Previous maps of radiation (left) were not as detailed as the recent Planck map (right) Although some scientists remain . sceptical about the theory of other universes, these findings may be a . step towards changing views on physics. The European Space Agency, which runs the £515million Planck telescope, said: 'Because precision of Planck’s map is so . high, it made it possible to reveal some peculiar unexplained . features that may well require new physics to be understood.' Cambridge professor of theoretical physics Malcolm Perry told the Sunday Times that the findings could be real evidence of the existence of other universes. While George Efstathiou, professor of astrophysics at the university, told the newspaper: 'Such ideas may sound wacky now, just like the Big Bang theory did three generations ago. But then we got evidence and now it has changed the whole way we think about the universe.'","Scientists studied radiation data gathered by Planck telescope .

"Weightlifting is more commonly associated with brawny men but a new breed of female gym goers are making fitness fashionable. Indeed, according to a new survey, men find women who lift weights more attractive. The research revealed that 63 per cent of men said they’d rather date a girl that weightlifts than one that heads straight to the treadmill. In fact, 74 per cent of men polled say watching a girl using the squat bench in the gym is their favourite spectator exercise. Scroll down for video . Fitness fans: Cameron Diaz, left, and Millie Mackintosh are leading a trend for women who lift weights and, according to a new survey, men find it attractive . Lifting fever is spreading fast across the UK, no doubt thanks to celebrities such as Millie Mackintosh, Chloe Madeley and Cameron Diaz, who all preach the benefits of weightlifting. In fact, the study witnessed a 58 per cent increase in bootcamp enquiries specifically asking about weight training methods as part of the programme. Over half of the women polled said they now train like a man - and with the men - with free weights and bars. It was also revealed that 75 per cent of women who use weightlifting as part of their fitness regime get their inspiration, confidence and techniques from social media app, Instagram, searching for hashtags such as #liftingladies, #fitfam and #squats. They work out: Over half of the women polled said they now train like a man - and with the men - with free weights and bars. Cameron, who has her own book, and Millie, right, both promote weightlifting . Jen Selter, who found fame on Instagram and has 4.8 million followers, came out as the number one social media star in the poll. Fitness fanatic Cameron Diaz, was named the most desirable celebrity weightlifter. The 42-year-old Hollywood star, who was also recently voted the best slim figure by Women's Health, and who is a renowned weightlifter, beat the likes of Mel B, Madonna and Fergie to the top spot. Steve Cody, personal trainer to X Factor’s Mel B and her husband Stephen Belafonte, and lead trainer at Wild Planet Bootcamps, who commissioned the research, said: 'Weight lifting is for everybody and it is great to see certain female celebrities pioneering this style of training. 'We have noticed our female clients are keen to start lifting but are not sure where to begin, they are coming to us to learn then hitting the weights in the gym with confidence when they return home.' Inspired: Women say they get inspiration, confidence and techniques from social media app, Instagram, searching for hashtags such as #liftingladies, #fitfam and #squats. Millie, left, and Chloe Madeley often post videos and snaps of their weightlifting sessions . Speaking about the growing popularity of weightlifting for women, Rich Sturla, Owner & Director of Personal Training at Results Health & Performance, near High Wycombe, said: . ‘Lifting weights is one of the best ways women can improve their health and physique. Strength training, weightlifting, resistance training - whatever you want to call it - helps women get stronger, leaner, more athletic and develop a balanced, healthy and toned body.’ Here are Rich’s Top 7 Lifting Tips for women. Top tips: Rich Sturla, Owner & Director of Personal Training at Results Health & Performance , near High Wycombe, shares his tips for women . 1. Bust the ‘Bulky’ Myth . Excess body fat is what makes women appear ‘bulky’, not having lean muscle. Lifting weights will not make you big (the exception being women who use anabolic steroids). The way women are naturally designed hormonally means that when you lift weights intelligently, you will burn fat from the areas you don’t want it, and keep toned muscle in the areas you want it. The more lean muscle a woman maintains, the more calories she will burn at rest. In short, lean muscles speed up your metabolism, resulting in more effective fat loss. Most women simply do not possess the level of testosterone necessary to support a bulky physique. Ask any man that is trying to bulk up – it’s hard! 2. Learn Proper Exercise Form . This is crucial - devote time to it up front. It’s much easier to learn proper form now than to ingrain poor habits and try to fix them later. I highly suggest working with a knowledgeable coach or learning from reputable demonstration videos. 3. Master the Basics . If you’re just getting into strength training, stick with a few exercises to start with. Why? Think about it this way - what would be easier to solve quickest; 6 riddles, or 20? Don’t be fooled into thinking you need to ‘keep your body guessing’, or that you must work every muscle individually with isolation exercises. For the best results, master your form and get stronger (more on that next…) in fundamental, compound human movements: . · Squat (or squat variation) · Deadlift (or deadlift variation) · Push Up (or a similar horizontal press) · Inverted Row (or a similar horizontal pull) · Overhead Press (or a similar vertical press) · Chin Up (or a similar vertical pull) If you have mobility issues/equipment restrictions/other concerns that don’t allow you to properly perform certain exercises, use appropriate exercise substitutions. For example, Goblet Squats can be a great alternative to Barbell Squats. Likewise, if you can’t Deadlift a straight bar off the floor, try Hex-Bar Deadlifts, Rack-Pulls, or even Single-Leg Deadlift variations. 4. Follow A Great Training Program . If you’re just getting into lifting weights, you need a well-structured, balanced program. Don’t make the mistake of following a training program for an intermediate or advanced lifter. While it may sound attractive, you’ll get the best results by following an appropriate training program for your experience level. My program at the end of this Femail article is a great place to start. 5. Focus On Getting Stronger . Almost everyone should focus on getting stronger, no matter what their primary goal is. It’s especially important for new lifters to develop a base level of strength. Focusing on building strength is the best way for a beginner to get results - seeing the numbers go up is highly motivating and a great way to love your workouts as you progress week after week. Think of strength as a glass, and the water inside the glass as all the ‘qualities’ we train for: athleticism, health, physique improvement, etc. The smaller your glass, the less ‘qualities’ you’re able to express or improve. You can’t be ‘athletic’ (or perform day-to-day physical tasks) without having a foundation of strength. You can’t boost your metabolism or burn more fat in your training without building the strength to progressively work harder and smarter. The larger you make your glass (strength), the more water (physical qualities) you’re able to place inside your glass. Strength is the foundation for improving performance and physical qualities. Guru: Rich says: 'Lifting weights is one of the best ways women can improve their health and physique. Strength training, weightlifting, resistance training - whatever you want to call it - helps women get stronger, leaner, more athletic and develop a balanced, healthy and toned body' 6. Set Motivating, Performance-Driven Goals . Spending an hour on the treadmill 3 or 4 times a week is about as motivating as sticking pins in your eyes for most women. It’s one reason why long-duration cardio is inferior to strength training for building a stronger, better looking and healthier body. Even if you just want to lose body fat and look better in your clothes, I highly recommend setting motivating, performance-driven goals like ‘Perform 5 Push Ups’ or “Deadlift my Bodyweight’. You will be more motivated to train consistently. All of my clients with the primary goal of losing body fat focus on getting stronger and improving their performance in the gym. They have more fun, enjoy training, increase their confidence, and within a short period of time realise their clothes are too big and they love the way they look. 7. Start Today . Don’t ‘Start on Monday’ or ‘Get back on it in the New Year’. Take action today. What does your first step need to be? Perhaps you should find a coach who can teach you proper exercise technique and set challenging goals. Maybe you need to get a great training program. Or possibly, you just need to get in the gym. Whatever first step you need to take, do it today.","63% of men would rather date a girl that weightlifts .

"A sales consultant is suing real estate firm Zillow for sexual harassment after she was allegedly ranked on breast size and sent pictures of colleagues' penises. Rachel Kremer claims she was sent graphic emails and pictures, objectified by her superiors and asked to perform sexual acts repeatedly for six months. Filing a federal suit, she described the revered company's Irvine, California, branch as an 'adult frat house'. Allegations: Rachel Kremer says she felt objectified by texts sent from her colleague Gabe Schmidt at Zillow . Ms Kremer claims she endured 'sexual torture' and said she is speaking out for other 'silenced' women . Ms Kremer, who worked at Zillow between June 2012 and August 2014, said she and other female empoyees endured 'sexual torture'. The firm has hit back, citing vulgar texts between Ms Kremer and her colleague Gabe Schmidt to show she was complicit in the exchanges. Her attorney, CNN legal analyst Ben Meiselas, insists this is evidence of 'brainwashing'. 'As to the substance of their motion, what has become clear is that employees were encouraged by management to use foul language in order to maintain a paycheck at Zillow,' Meiselas told GeekWire. 'Being brainwashed by this corporate culture does not invite actual unwanted sexual advances and physical touching.' According to Ms Kremer, her action speaks for others who have been 'silenced'. 'Adult frat house': Ms Kremer likens her former colleagues' behavior to that of a college fraternity . Law suit: Her attorney is arguing that Ms Kremer played along with the jokes because she was brainwashed . The suit states: 'Ms Kremer's male supervisors ranked her according to her breast size, sent pictures of their penis to her, and demanded sexual gratification and obedience by Ms Kremer to continue her employment.' Two colleagues, including Mr Schmidt, have been fired over the incident, GeekWire reported. Zillow was named in the list of America's top 50 companies to work for this week. An employee satisfaction survey collated by Glassdoor.com pegged the firm at 33, a notch above Ford Motor Company and two below NBC Universal. Action: The company said two employees were fired over Ms Kremer's complaint before the case started . However, the sexual harassment claim comes days after another suit accuses the Irvine branch of penalizing an employee who reported unlawful behavior in his department. James Friedrich was allegedly deprived of multiple promotions after he reported that a co-worker fraudulently boosted their sales figures. The suit claims Mr Friedrich was told to 'drop it' and 'stop hanging out' with two of his friends when he brought the claim to his superiors.","Rachel Kremer was allegedly sent pictures of colleagues penises .

"There is a convincing argument to suggest that Simon Mignolet isn’t good enough to a Liverpool goalkeeper. If that is the case then logic tells us his understudy Brad Jones isn’t either. Jones hadn’t played a Barclays Premier League game for more than 18 months prior to Sunday’s game at Old Trafford. Such are Liverpool’s problems at the moment, though, that the Australian was handed perhaps the biggest challenge of his rather modest career. When Liverpool reflect on what went wrong, they will perhaps not focus too much on their stand-in goalkeeper. He is not the reason they lost. Manager Brendan Rodgers will focus on chances missed by Raheem Sterling and Mario Balotelli and ask why defenders Martin Skrtel and Dejan Lovren made basic errors. David de Gea denies Mario Balotelli in the second half in what was an impressive display from United No 1 . De Gea celebrates as United go up the other end of the pitch and score as he keeps a clean sheet . De Gea pulled off a number of important saves to deny Raheem Sterling . Brad Jones had a game to forget as he let in three goals as Liverpool lost at United . Nevertheless, while United goalkeeper David de Gea made three or four crucial saves that helped his own only fleetingly effective team over the line, it is very much the case that Jones offered Liverpool very little, or anything, of the same ilk. De Gea - United’s player of the season so far – made two good saves – both from Sterling – and one outstanding one from Balotelli. Undoubtedly, United would not have won without them. The first save stopped his team falling behind and 25 seconds later they were ahead. His stop from Balotelli, meanwhile, came at the start of the second half and prevented Liverpool assembling a comeback that was beginning to look likely. Jones, on the other hand, was largely helpless, if not quite hopeless. His very first contribution was to slice a clearance first time up in the air. Given that distribution has been one of Mignolet’s recent problems, this did not bode well. Soon after, he was picking the ball out of his net, having dived the wrong way as Wayne Rooney struck firmly towards goal from the edge of the penalty area. Jones (left) gets his hands to the ball under pressure from United forward James Wilson . Jones can only watch on as Juan Mata (left) scores United's second at Old Trafford . Mata wheels away to celebrate as the Australian remonstrates with the Liverpool defence . After that, there was a rash dash from goal at a corner – he got nowhere near the ball – and a routine take from a low Rooney cross before he could do nothing about Juan Mata’s decisive second goal scored from an offside position just before half-time. De Gea was actually the busier goalkeeper for much of the game and perhaps that didn’t help Jones. Goalkeepers – like to outfield players – like to find a rhythm, especially if they haven’t played for a while, and Jones was unable to do that here. The save he made from a Rooney shot as United broke early in the second period was comfortable enough but shortly after De Gea’s saved from Balotelli, Jones stumbled in trying to adjust to Lovren’s error and Robin van Persie was able to slide the third goal in to an empty net. It wasn’t a decisive mistake. It wasn’t even that noticeable at first. But it was indicative of Liverpool’s afternoon. Not good enough. But then we knew that. About Jones and the indeed about the team he represents.","Brad Jones started his first game for Liverpool in 18 months .

"Once a universally acknowledged style disaster - and only sported by pensioners on the beach - the sandals and socks look has made a resurgence lately, thanks to celebrities such as David Beckham and Justin Bieber. However, it appears the nation is still unconvinced: wearing socks with your sandals has just been voted the biggest fashion faux pas of all time in a poll carried out by Debenhams.

Ed Watson, spokesperson for the store, said: 'Socks and sandals are the epitome of British summer style gone wrong. 'The fashion crowd might have classed it as en vogue but our customers have voted it the worst look of all time.' Other fashion catastrophes on the list include platforms on men (sorry, Tom Cruise)  and low-slung trousers, as well as 80s horrors such as shell suits and bum bags. Crop tops also appeared in the top ten - even though they've been all over the red carpet for a while now. Watson explained: 'It might look chic on a catwalk, but this isn’t a look that many of us want to see on our local High Streets.' Crop flop: Belly-baring tops, like those worn by Cara Delevigne and Rita Ora, were voted one of the most hated styles . In fact, quite a few of the top ten most hated styles have been adopted of late by the fashion crowd. Model of the moment Cara Delevigne is a serial offender. Trucker cap? Check. Crop top? Yep. Low-slung trousers? Tick. She's worn them all. She even appeared in a campaign for accessories brand My Crazy Scrunchie in December last year - the hair ties came in at number ten on the list.

"Manchester United secured their sixth straight Premier League win after easing past arch-rivals Liverpool at Old Trafford on Sunday. Wayne Rooney and Juan Mata's first-half goals ultimately proved too much for Brendan Rodgers' side to come back from, as Robin van Persie added a third goal late on to compound their misery. Sportsmail's Neil Ashton rates all the players' performances at Old Trafford. MANCHESTER UNITED (3-5-2) DAVID DE GEA: Two decent saves from Sterling in the first half, scaring the Liverpool winger into making a mistake when he was clean through at the start of the second half too. 8.5 . PHIL JONES: Booked for reckless foul on Coutinho. Not fully fit but smothered pretty much everything that came his way. 7 . Phil Jones - making his first appearance in two months for United - challenges for the ball with Adam Lallana . Michael Carrick put in another commanding display as he impressed against Liverpool . MICHAEL CARRICK: Decent interceptions and cheeky first-half back heel to befuddle Sterling. Looked accomplished in the libero role. 8 . JONNY EVANS: Mock indignation when he was booked for foul on Coutinho. Deserved yellow. Leadership qualities not in dispute though. 7 . ANTONIO VALENCIA: Sweet ball in for Rooney’s opener, but it doesn’t escape the fact United are in the market for a right winger next summer and are prepared to spend big on him. 7 . Antonio Valencia provided a crucial assist for United's opening goal against Liverpool . MAROUANE FELLAINI: Booked for clumsy foul on Lallana after four minutes. Could have gone for early second half foul. 6.5 . WAYNE ROONEY: Took his goal brilliantly and warmed to his role in the centre of the pitch. Booked for chopping Coutinho. Disciplined defensively second half. Excellent performance. 7.5 . Wayne Rooney expertly steers the ball to give United an early lead against Liverpool . The United captain shows his delight after giving Manchester United the lead against arch-rivals Liverpool . ASHLEY YOUNG: Trademark flail of the arms early in the first half, accompanied by appeal for free kick on the touchline. Did ok. 6.5 . JUAN MATA: Miles offside for his goal but he didn’t hang around for the inquest. It’s coming together for United. 7 . Juan Mata heads home from close range to double United lead's before the half-time mark . ROBIN VAN PERSIE: Exquisite finish again, top class. Had come alive when Young’s cross found him in the area to tee-up United’s second. 7 . Robin van Persie netted United's third goal late on to add gloss to the scoreline . JAMES WILSON: Looked lost, which is a shame because with his pace Liverpool’s defence was there for the taking. 6 . SUBSTITUTES: ANDER HERRERA (Wilson 71): Few decent touches. 6 . FALCAO (Rooney 77): First touch nearly set up RVP for another but he was offside. PADDY McNAIR (Jones 89): N/A . SUBSTITUTES NOT USED: Adnan Januzaj, Anders Lindegaard,  Darren Fletcher, Tyler Blackett. BOOKED: Fellaini, Jones, Evans, Rooney. MANAGER - LOUIS VAN GAAL: Got it spot on. Again. 9 . Raheem Sterling - who spurned a host of golden opportunity to  score for Liverpool - is tackled by Jones . LIVERPOOL: (3-5-2) BRAD JONES: Big call to play him and only excuse for diving the wrong way on Rooney goal is if he was unsighted. Cannot be blamed for offside second by Mata. 6 . GLEN JOHNSON: Limped off after 25 minutes. Until then had added nothing for this game. Replaced by Kolo Toure. 5 . Liverpool woes are compounded as Glen Johnson goes off injured for the visitors . MARTIN SKRTEL: Crazy to think that this was one of his better games. Imagine a bad one. 6 . DEJAN LOVREN: Lively exchange with Gerrard at the start of the second half.

Jordan Henderson - speaking with manager Brendan Rodgers - was completed isolated on the right wing . JOE ALLEN: Should have been booked for 11th minute foul on Mata. Eventually booked for clotheslining Valencia. 5 . STEVEN GERRARD: Dragged out of position for Rooney opener. Looks like a man who is ready to blow. 5 . A hapless Steven Gerrard looks on after Liverpool concede their third goal of the afternoon .

Replaced by Balotelli at half-time. 5 . The Liverpool youngster fires in a shot on goal but David de Gea was equal to the task . RAHEEM STERLING: Twice denied by De Gea in opening 20 minutes.

"It was the match billed by Gary Neville as the 'Dog and Duck versus The Red Lion'. And there were times at Old Trafford when both back lines showed as much defensive acumen as a bunch of hungover, overweight blokes chasing around cluelessly on a muddy park pitch. In the end, however, it was Liverpool who were made to look the more amateurish as Manchester United took their chances to record a resounding win over their old rivals. Michael Carrick, at the heart of United's defence, deals with the threat of Liverpool's Raheem Sterling . Phil Jones, on the right side of United's defence, goes shoulder-to-shoulder with Adam Lallana early on . Dejan Lovren reflects on an incredibly disappointing afternoon for Liverpool against their old rivals . On another afternoon, Raheem Sterling might have succeeded in his personal duel with David De Gea and claimed a hat-trick. Frankly, Mario Balotelli might have done likewise in the second-half but for the Spanish goalkeeper's defiant, dominant performance. It could have been 3-3, even 5-3 to Liverpool. But somehow, through a combination of De Gea's brilliance, some defensive improvisation and, most importantly, clinical finishing, United emerged victorious. It was most definitely a case of square pegs into round holes with the team selections. Louis van Gaal once again reverted to the back three that has made United look so vulnerable this season. Nobody looks entirely comfortable - still - but the Dutch coach hoped the inclusion of Michael Carrick in the centre would act as a lightning rod for the nervousness this system usually generates. Either side of him was Jonny Evans, barely back from his injury lay-off but needed after Marcos Rojo picked up another injury in training on Saturday, and Phil Jones. Liverpool favoured a back three as well, with Glen Johnson, Martin Skrtel and Dejan Lovren matching United's approach. Alberto Moreno was on hand to track back if required. Raheem Sterling gets in behind Phil Jones but is denied at the near post by David De Gea . Jones earned himself a booking for this foul on Philippe Coutinho close to the halfway line . Liverpool defender Dejan Lovren competes for the ball with Robin van Persie at Old Trafford . It was bold, especially for a team entering the game off the back of a deflating week that had seen them crash out of the Champions League, but Liverpool started very positively. The chaos that is United's back line this season was evident immediately as Philippe Coutinho whipped in a second-minute corner and United needed several swings of the boot to clear the danger. Marouane Fellaini's tendency to look for a backwards pass rather than an adventurous one heaped unnecessary pressure on Jones and Carrick early on and United certainly didn't look like a side entering the fixture off the back of five consecutive wins. The United back line was carved open for the first time on 11 minutes, caught gawping as Adam Lallana's through pass set Sterling one-on-one with David De Gea, the Spanish goalkeeper standing tall to block in what would become a running theme of the afternoon. 25 seconds later, Liverpool had been punished for the miss in ruthless fashion. Moreno and Joe Allen were confused by Antonio Valencia, who nutmegged the latter and crossed for Wayne Rooney to sweep the ball home. Goalkeeper Brad Jones, in for the woeful Simon Mignolet, didn't exactly cover himself in glory by diving early and completely the wrong way. Wayne Rooney's opener resulted from Antonio Valencia getting past Joe Allen on the right wing . Phil Jones slides in to try and dispossess the dangerous Raheem Sterling . Alberto Moreno slides in on Phil Jones - one of many meaty challenges during the first half . Perhaps former United defender Rio Ferdinand put it best, tweeting: 'The way Valencia just stood up them 3 LFC defenders & Bacardi breezed was nuts.' The way Rooney was allowed to steam in unchecked by any Liverpool defender was as alarming for Rodgers. While Carrick was having the intended effect at centre-half, a model of consistency in his passing and reading of the play, Jones was finding Sterling a handful. He was again rescued by De Gea on 23 minutes, when his England colleague turned him with ease. Jones was senselessly anticipating a cut-back, Sterling left him looking like a statue. Some of the challenges were seismic, as you might expect from this fixture. Jones and Evans went into the book for tripping Coutinho during the first-half, walking a tightrope. Fellaini was booked too, to nobody's surprise. Johnson wasn't injured by one of these thunderous challenges but felt something in his groin and limped off, to be replaced by Kolo Toure. Juan Mata doubled United's lead from an offside position five minutes before half-time but it showed something of Liverpool's lack of confidence that only one of their defenders bothered appealing. Michael Carrick's heat map shows his influence in United's defence . Martin Skrtel gets the better of United striker James Wilson during an aerial battle . Glen Johnson walks off after suffering a first-half injury during the match at Old Trafford . Five minutes into the second-half and United's defensive gremlins surfaced again. Evans played a slack back pass, allowing Sterling to run through one-on-one with De Gea. Again, the goalkeeper prevailed, Old Trafford breathing a sigh of relief. Liverpool continued to push, the game was not up in their eyes. Mario Balotelli, introduced at half-time, was thwarted initially by a superb Jones slide tackle, before De Gea pushed his resultant snapshot against the crossbar. Where United would be without the young keeper is unthinkable. Certainly not in third place, probably not even in the top half. Far more than being a much-needed last line of defence, he's been a match-winner in at least half-a-dozen games this season already. Liverpool's greatest defensive shambles of the afternoon allowed United to wrap it up 20 minutes from the end. Lovren's clearance of Rooney's low ball was atrocious, falling straight to Mata who wisely shifted the ball wide to the unmarked Van Persie. With Jones again diving too soon, the Dutchman swept the ball into an empty net. The Dog and Duck would be proud. Liverpool's defence were caught hopelessly out of position for Van Persie's third .

"Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini is to investigate the spate of muscle injuries that threatens to undermine his side's return to form. City could have to play through the Christmas programme without a recognised senior striker and their captain after a costly 1-0 victory over Barclays Premier League bottom side Leicester on Saturday. The club's only fit striker, Edin Dzeko, suffered a calf muscle injury in the warm-up before skipper Vincent Kompany pulled up with a recurrence of a hamstring problem late in the second half. Vincent Kompany (centre) was substituted late in Manchester City's game against Leicester on Saturday . Edin Dzeko (top right) sustained a calf injury in the warm-up before City's game against Leicester . Both are unlikely to be fit before new year and join forwards Sergio Aguero and Stevan Jovetic on the casualty list. Their absences will leave sizeable gaps at both ends of the field and Pellegrini wants to find out if there is an underlying cause, although the Chilean will not make excuses. 'Maybe we must find a reason why,' said Pellegrini, whose side have won seven in succession. 'It is very unlucky to have the three strikers out with injuries but we must try to solve the problem and play another way, or keep a clean sheet. 'It is difficult because we have to play a lot of games during the last days of December, but I never complain about the players who cannot play.' Kompany had been making his comeback after a three-game absence with a hamstring injury and the influential Belgian also missed a game at QPR in November with a calf problem. Dzeko had only recently returned from a four-game lay-off with a calf strain while Jovetic has had niggly hamstring issues in recent weeks and aggravated them in Wednesday's Champions League win at Roma. Sergio Aguero (centre) has been in superb form for City this season but is out injured for around six weeks . Fellow striker Stevan Jovetic (right) has aggravated a hamstring problem and also faces time out injured . City manager Manuel Pellegrini (centre) has vowed to look into the number of muscle injuries his side have had . Full-back Aleksandar Kolarov missed all City's November fixtures with a calf injury. Top scorer Aguero has knee ligament damage and could be out for up to eight weeks. Teenage striker Jose Angel Pozo was drafted into the side at the King Power Stadium at the last moment and the lack of current alternatives could force City into the transfer market in January. Pellegrini said: 'In January we will see, it is an option. I think our squad must always be strong.' Another looming problem is the loss of midfielder Yaya Toure to the African Nations Cup next month. That is likely to mean Pellegrini will press harder to extend the loan of Frank Lampard in the coming days. Former England and Chelsea midfielder Lampard again proved City's chief inspiration and was their match-winner at Leicester, netting the only goal - his sixth for the club - five minutes before half-time. Pellegrini wants Frank Lampard (centre) to stay at the club for longer than his current loan spell states . The 36-year-old's loan from sister club New York City expires at the end of the month and Pellegrini has made clear he wants him to stay longer. He also said after the game that Lampard himself also wanted to stay on. A decision has not yet been made but Pellegrini had already come to a firm opinion on his value before the injuries to strikers that left the veteran as one of the team's few obvious goalscorers. 'That is why he is now on the team but he would not stay with us because we have injured strikers,' said Pellegrini. 'He would stay with us because he is a very important player.' City were laboured but at least kept claimed the three points needed to prevent Chelsea extending their three-point advantage at the top of the table. Leicester made the early running and rallied late on but City's defence held firm and recorded a valuable third clean sheet in the space of a week. 'As a defender it is always nice to have a clean sheet but I want to say all the team defended well,' said right-back Bacary Sagna. 'We faced a very athletic team. They tried to create problems but we stayed compact as a team and finally we got the three points. We have to look forward and keep working.' Bacary Sagna (middle) was happy with how his team defended against Leicester during their 1-0 win . Nigel Pearson (left) watches on as his side slipped to another defeat, this time at home to Manchester City . Leicester boss Nigel Pearson feels his side are letting themselves down at both ends of the field. The result left the promoted Foxes bottom of the table and without a win in 11 games, since they stunned Manchester United on September 21. He said: 'This remains the frustrating aspect about our season so far - that we are not converting key chances and an inability to keep that clean sheet. 'We find ourselves adrift at the bottom at the moment and that is something we are going to have to rectify. 'From a tactical perspective we didn't really allow them to have a great deal of dominance. 'But the bottom line is, it is about being dominant in both boxes and we have not delivered that again.'","Captain Vincent Kompany limped off late-on in victory over Leicester City .

"Former Vice President Dick Cheney continued his fierce defense of the harsh interrogation techniques used by the CIA in the wake of the 9/11 attacks, defiantly saying that he 'would do it again in a minute.' Speaking on NBC's Meet The Press on Sunday, Cheney said there was 'no comparison' between the tactics and the deaths of American citizens on September 11, 2001, adding that the CIA had 'very carefully avoided' the practice of torture. 'Torture is what the Al-Qaeda terrorists did to 3,000 Americans on 9/11. There is no comparison between that and what we did with respect to enhanced interrogation,' said Cheney. Scroll down for video . Appearing on Meet The Press on Sunday, Cheney once again defended the harsh interrogation techniques used by the CIA in the wake of the 9/11 attacks . The former vice president also said he wasn't concerned about that some of the foreign nationals captured and interrogated turned out to be innocent. 'I have no problem as long as we achieve our objective and our objective is to get the guys who did 9/11 and it is to avoid another attack against the United States,' he said. His comments come in the wake of a damning Senate report into the CIA treatment of Al-Qaeda suspects that has triggered global revulsion. Asked whether the practice of 'rectal rehydration' was acceptable, Cheney acknowledged that it was not part of the interrogation program. But, he added, 'I believe it was done for medical reasons' - a notion that has been questioned by medical experts. The former vice president also hit back against the report's claim that President George W. Bush was misled about the extent of the practices. 'This man knew what we were doing,' he said, outlining daily briefings that included the president, the CIA director and himself. 'He authorized it. He approved it.' Cheney acknowledged that 'rectal rehydration' was not part of the interrogation program, but said he 'believed it was done for medical reasons' Cheney had previously branded the Senate report a 'terrible piece of work' that is 'deeply flawed'. 'The report's full of cr**,' Cheney told Fox News host Bret Baier on Wednesday evening. Furthermore, the CIA never tortured anyone under the legal definition of the word, as asserted by Department of Justice lawyers at the time, he said. The retired politician, who said it was his job in the administration to oversee programs like the one used by the CIA, said the government agency's actions were 'justified'. According to an anonymous CIA official, Bush was fully informed of the intelligence agency's torture program, and had in fact authorized its use. Former vice president Dick Cheney had previously branded the Senate report a 'terrible piece of work' that is 'deeply flawed' Speaking to the Times, the spokesman also identified a number of other senior Bush administration officials he claims ordered and approved the 'enhanced interrogation' programme that led to 119 Al Qaeda suspects being tortured with techniques such as waterboarding. The official said those in the know included: Cheney, Bush's legal adviser Alberto Gonzales; National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice; Stephen Hadley, her deputy; Attorney General John Ashcroft; and several attorneys in the Justice Department. He said that neither Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld nor Secretary of State Colin Powell were officially informed of the CIA torture program. The former vice president said it is 'not true' that Bush didn't know that aggressive interrogation techniques were being used on terrorism suspects until four years into the program. 'Read his book,' Cheney told Baier. 'He talks about it extensively in his memoirs. He was in fact an integral party of the program. He had to approve it before we went forward with it.' Accused: George Bush pictured alongside then Vice President Dick Cheney. The former U.S. President fully authorized the brutal torture of terror suspects, CIA officials said today, furiously dismissing accusations that the intelligence agency's so-called 'enhanced interrogation techniques' took place without the knowledge . According to a CIA spokesperson, a number of high-ranking members of the Bush administration were informed of the CIA's 'enhanced interrogation' programme. These include: . George Bush - President of the United States . Dick Cheney - Vice President of the United States . Alberto Gonzales - Bush's legal advisor . Condoleezza Rice - National Security Adviser . Stephen Hadley - Deputy National Security Adviser . John Ashcroft - United States Attorney General . Several attorneys in the United States Justice Department. Cheney said Bush was focused on a number of other issues at the time, but 'I think that he knew everything he needed to know and wanted to know about the program,' including the fact that prisoners were being waterboarded. 'There no effort on our part to keep him from that' information Cheney said, contrary to the claims made in the Senate report. 'So the notion that the committee's trying to peddle that somehow the agency was operating on a rogue basis and we weren't being told or the president wasn't being told, is just a flat out lie,' he stated. What really happened, Cheney said, is 'we asked the agency to go take steps and put in place programs that were designed to catch the ba****** who killed 3,000 of us on 9/11, and to make sure it didn't happen again, and that's actually what they did.' The former second in command said that the CIA operatives who ran the detention and interrogation program 'deserve a lot of credit,' not the 'condemnation' they are receiving from Senate Democrats who authorized the controversial report. Cheney admitted that 9/11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed was waterboarded 183 times but he said that did not constitute torture. 'What are we supposed to do? Kiss him on both cheeks and say, please, please tell us what you know?' Cheney said. 'Of course not. We did exactly what needed to be done in order to catch those who were guilty on 9/11 and to prevent a further attack, and we were successful on both parts.' The Bush era vice president said that the CIA only used techniques on terrorism suspects that it used on its own operatives as part of their training and that includes waterboarding. He admitted that rectal feeding, a process the CIA files revealed by the Senate say detainees were submitted to, was not one of the 12 techniques approved by the White House. But he then said: 'What are you prepared to do to get information about future attacks on the United States?' 'In terms of there being some problems in the program, there may have well have been...but I don't think the Senate report represents the truth of what actually happened,' he said. Controversy: Chained detainees are seen arriving at Camp X-Ray on Guantanamo Bay ahead of interrogation about their suspected involvement with terrorist groups including Al Qaeda or the Taliban . Cheney said he hadn't read the entire 6,000-page document that the Senate's redacted paper was based on nor had he read the full 500-page declassified summary released by the Intelligence Committee yesterday. Upon learning that one of the interrogation subjects died, Cheney said, 'I have no sympathy for them,' again reminding Baier that al Qaeda killed 3,000 Americans on 9/11. He later told the Fox News that Americans have to remember that al Qaeda was reportedly trying to get their hands on nuclear weapons after the assault on American soil and there were anthrax attacks occurring at the time. 'There was every reason to expect' that there was going to be a follow-up terrorist attack, as well, he said. The CIA 'did one hell of a job, and they deserve our gratitude,' an unapologetic Cheney said.","Former vice president continued his fierce defense of the harsh interrogation techniques on Sunday's Meet The Press .

"Manchester United ambassador Bryan Robson believes Louis van Gaal's decision to introduce double training sessions could be the reason behind the club's injury crisis. Van Gaal has been unable to call on the services of several first team stars during the course of the season due to muscular injuries and Robson believes there is a reason behind the problem. Robson, speaking to talkSPORT ahead of Manchester United's Premier League clash against Liverpool, said: 'I don’t think you can ever say you’re unlucky when you’re getting a lot of injuries. I think, when you’re a coach, you’ve always got to assess [why they’re happening]. Manchester United stars including Chris Smalling and Marcos Rojo have missed parts of the season . Louis van Gaal could be to blame for Manchester United's poor injury record, according to Bryan Robson . 'Manchester United had a long pre-season and they came back with quite a few injuries. Maybe it was because of the travelling and everything they got a lot of muscle injuries early on in the season and I think he [Louis van Gaal] had to adjust his training a little bit but he did want to do double sessions which the players, under Sir Alex Ferguson, were not used to. 'So maybe it’s because of those double sessions players have picked up muscle injuries. The only way you can say you’re a little bit unlucky is if you’re getting twisted ankles like Michael Carrick and Luke Shaw, they got ankle injuries and there is nothing you can do about that. 'When you’re getting a lot of muscle injuries yourself and your staff have definitely got to look at your training and see if you’ve got to adjust to make sure you can get your best players out on the pitch.' Van Gaal said before his side's home match against Liverpool that he is finally seeing 'light at the end of the tunnel' regarding United's injury problems this season. The Dutchman will be without just four senior squad members for the match against Liverpool with Chris Smalling, Luke Shaw, Daley Blind and Angel di Maria unavailable for selection. Angel di Maria will miss Man United's match against Liverpool due to an injury he sustained against Hull .","Bryan Robson has questioned Louis van Gaal's coaching methods .

"Sending signals: Jeb Bush will release emails and an e-book to give voters an insight into his beliefs in the clearest sign yet that he plans to run for president . Jeb Bush is releasing 250,000 emails and an e-book in the clearest signal yet that he plans to run for president. The news comes after Bush, 61, revealed he will announce his plans to run or not 'in short order'. But first he wants to 'let people make up their mind' by making vast swathes of his work files public at the beginning of 2015. The former Florida governor, George W Bush's younger brother, insists the release will offer a candid insight into his beliefs and ideals because he 'was digital before digital was cool'. He cryptically described the documents as containing 'some funny ones...some sad ones...some serious ones'. 'One of the things I am going to do as I go through this process is release all of my e-mails and write an e-book, which has been kind of fun to go back and to think about this, and remind myself that if you run with big ideas and then you're true to those ideas, and get a chance to serve and implement them and do it with passion and conviction, you can move the needle,' Bush told WPLG's Glenna Milberg. 'And that's what we need right now in America.' His words came in a wide-reaching interview that addressed his criticism of President Obama's immigration plans. Earlier this month, the younger Bush said he will make up his mind on whether to follow his father and brother into the White House based on whether he can 'lift people's spirits and not get sucked into the vortex', and whether 'the sacrifice for my family is tolerable'. He said: 'I'm thinking about running for president. And I'll make up my mind in short order - not that far out in the future.' 'I don't know if I'd be a good candidate or a bad one,' Bush continued. 'I kind of know how a Republican can win, whether it's me or somebody else, and it has to be much more uplifting, much more positive, much more willing to be practical...'. Bush, who is the son of one former president and brother of another, also blasted Obama's immigration order for going 'way beyond' what other presidents have done. He reiterated his support for a pathway to legal status for those immigrants who are in the U.S. illegally. But he said Obama may have exceeded his constitutional authority by unilaterally lifting the threat of deportation from millions of such immigrants last month. 'The idea that, well, Reagan did it, my dad did it - they did it on a much smaller scale and they did it with consent of Congress. There are a lot of differences,' Bush said on December 1 at the Wall Street Journal's CEO Council, an invitation-only event in Washington featuring some of the nation's most powerful CEOs. Speaking publicly about the order for the first time, Bush said Obama's move 'makes it harder' for Congress to adopt lasting immigration reform. 'It's a shame,' he added. The former Florida governor is seen as the early favorite of business-minded Republicans eager to reclaim the White House in 2016. 'What America needs right now': Bush, younger brother of George W, branded Obama hesitant and indecisive . While he would be a force in the Republican presidential primary, Bush would face criticism from the party's conservative wing unhappy with his positions on immigration and education reform. Those who attended the event, however, include many political donors and Republican business leaders who support a more forgiving immigration policy. Bush was seen chatting with News Corp. head Rupert Murdoch, who has urged lawmakers to adopt a pathway to legal status for immigrants who are in the country illegally. Two of the last three Republican presidents - Ronald Reagan and Bush's father, George H.W. Bush - also extended amnesty to family members of immigrants who were not covered by the last major overhaul of immigration law in 1986. Obama's executive order has drawn a withering response from Republicans, but also has laid bare divisions within the GOP over how to deal with immigration. The issue is seen as critical for the GOP ahead of the 2016 presidential contest as party officials work to attract more Hispanic voters. The comments come as Bush works this week to keep his public profile high. Jeb Bush (right) hugs his brother former president George W Bush at a Republican Party campaign event . Earlier in the day, he attended a Capitol Hill fundraiser for Republican Senate hopeful Bill Cassidy, less than a week before Cassidy faces incumbent Democratic Senator Mary Landrieu of Louisana in a runoff election that could increase the GOP's new majority. Bush, whose wife is Mexican, told the CEO Council that he supports a nation in which people ultimately find no need to identify their cultural origin. 'That is the America we should aspire to - not the one where we're dividing ourselves up to find where we are different,' he said. 'But the fact that you're from a different place or you've got a different origin is totally irrelevant.'","Bush wants to 'let people make up their mind' about potential nomination .

"Turkish police raided media outlets linked to U.S.-based Muslim cleric Fethullah Gulen today and detained 23 journalists and television producers. The operation acted against what President Tayyip Erdogan claims is a network conspiring to topple him. The raids on Zaman newspaper and Samanyolu television marked an escalation of Mr Erdogan's battle with former ally Mr Gulen. Turkish police arrested 23 journalists and television producers in raids on media outlets linked to U.S.-based Muslim cleric Fethullah Gulen today . Staff and supporters of Zaman newspaper shout slogans as editor-in-chief Ekrem Dumanli, centre, is arrested by counter-terror police at the newspaper headquarters in Istanbul today . He has been in open conflict with Gulen since a graft investigation targeting Mr Erdogan's inner circle emerged a year ago. 'The free press cannot be silenced,' a crowd chanted outside Zaman's offices as its editor Ekrem Dumanli made a speech defiantly challenging police to detain him - as Hidayet Karaca, the chairman of Samanyolu TV, was arrested in Istanbul. Just before his arrest, Mr Karaca told reporters: 'This is a shameful sight for Turkey. 'Sadly in 21st century Turkey, this is the treatment they dish out to a media group with tens of television and radio stations, internet media and magazines.' Arrest warrants had reportedly been issued for 32 people. A man holds a placard that reads 'a time for democracy' as people gather in support outside Zaman newspaper in Istanbul, Turkey . Supporters of cleric Fethullah Gulen read  the Koran and newspapers as they wait outside a courthouse after Turkish police began an operation targeting the media . State broadcaster TRT Haber said 23 people were detained in raids across the country, including two former police chiefs. As well as Mr Karaca, a television producer, a director and scriptwriters were held. Mr Erdogan introduced many democratic reforms in his first years in power and curbed army involvement in politics after his AK Party was elected in 2002. NATO allies often cited Turkey, a candidate for the EU, as an example of a successful Muslim democracy. But more recently critics have accused the President of intolerance of dissent and, increasingly, a divisive reversion to Islamist roots. English-language Today's Zaman editor Bulent Kenes told Reuters police had shown them documentation which referred to a charge of 'forming a gang to try and seize state sovereignty'. Zaman editor-in-chief Ekrem Dumanli is escorted by plainclothes police officers and cheered on by his colleagues as he leaves Zaman's headquarters . Mr Dumanli kisses a Turkish flag as supporters of the Fethullah Gulen movement surround him . Crowds chanted 'The free press cannot be silenced,' outside Zaman's offices as its editor Ekrem Dumanli, right, was detained . Government ministers declined to make specific comments on the raids, but Health Minister Mehmet Muezzinoglu, according to state media, said: 'Anyone who does wrong pays the price'. Main opposition CHP leader Kemal Kilicdaroglu said: 'This is a coup government. A coup is being carried out against democracy'. Mr Erdogan has accused Mr Gulen of establishing a 'parallel structure' within the state through his supporters in the judiciary, police and other state institutions, as well as wielding influence through the media. The cleric denies the accusation of seeking to overthrow Mr Erdogan's government. Mr Erdogan drew on Mr Gulen's influence on the police and judiciary in the first years of his government in taming an army that had toppled four administrations since 1960, including Turkey's first Islamist-led cabinet. That relationship has dramatically soured. Turkish police launched a sweeping operation to arrest supporters of President Tayyip Erdogan's rival, US-exiled imam Fethullah Gulen . Mr Dumanli, left,  made a speech defiantly challenging police to detain him, and right, film director Engin Koc was also arrested . Plain-clothed Turkish policemen arrest TV producer Salih Asan as part of an operation to simultaneously detain broadcasters and journalists . Mr Gulen denies the accusation of seeking to overthrow Mr Erdogan's government. Pictured, TV producer Salih Asan is arrested . Mr Erdogan, who consolidated his power further in moving from the prime minister's office to the presidency in August, said on Friday he would pursue Mr Gulen's supporters into their 'lairs'. He has described them in the past as terrorists and traitors. The graft investigation, which became public with police raids on December 17 last year, led to the resignation of three ministers and prompted Mr Erdogan to purge the state apparatus. He reassigned thousands of police and hundreds of judges and prosecutors and has also pushed through legislation increasing government control of the judiciary - most recently a law restructuring two top courts. Meanwhile, prosecutors have dropped the corruption cases. Today's police raids had been expected for several days after a widely-followed Twitter account, which has previously given advance warning of police operations, said police were set to detain around 400 people, including around 150 journalists regarded as Mr Gulen supporters.

"Ahead of kick-off at Old Trafford, Liverpool tweeted a picture of Steven Gerrard’s shirt hanging up in the visitors’ dressing room. After another defeat in the Barclays Premier League - their seventh of the season - the Liverpool captain could not get out of this place quick enough. Last March, when the club were challenging for the title, he scored twice in a 3-0 victory here at Old Trafford to maintain the momentum.

Gerrard (left) looks on as  United's players celebrate Robin van Persie's goal to make it 3-0 to the home side . Gerrard holds his head in his hands as Liverpool sank to another Premier League defeat at Old Trafford . On Sunday he looked up to the heavens at the final whistle and appeared to be pleading for help. Is this really happening? Afraid so, Stevie. Brendan Rodgers will tell you that his team dominated possession and should have got something out of Liverpool’s biggest game of the season. The body language of the players will tell you differently. This is a dysfunctional mob, a group of players slung together over the summer and asked to repeat last season’s extraordinary feats. There is no chance of that now, not after the manner and the conviction of this defeat by their oldest rivals in English football. Who knows what Liverpool are aiming for now and it will only be magnified when the draw for the last 32 of the Europa League takes places again. They have the feel of a category B club again. This Liverpool dressing room is split, divided in their approach after failing to finish second behind Real Madrid in their Champions League group. ‘I wouldn’t tell if there have been issues, we keep that sort of thing internal,’ claimed Rodgers. It feels like it is out in the open anyhow. Liverpool’s defence was all over the place at times here, cowed into a corner by the brilliance of Wayne Rooney, Robin van Persie and the extremely fortunate Juan Mata. Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers reacts during his side's 3-0 defeat to Manchester United . Raheem Sterling (left) was repeatedly denied by the excellent performance of David de Gea (right) Sterling crashed to the ground and looked devastated by the result as the full-time whistle was blown . De Gea (left) managed to keep Mario Balotelli (right) waiting for his first Liverpool Premier League goal . Here at Old Trafford we perhaps witnessed a Liverpool team look disaffected and done in for the first time in living memory. The decision to play Brad Jones ahead of Simon Mignolet - admittedly no great shakes this season - clearly disrupted the Liverpool defence. So did the switch to 3-4-3, without a main striker and a load of work on the training ground in the days leading up to the game. It was a mistake. Liverpool’s confidence is shot, summed up by the decision-making and their failure to show any sign of cohesion or spirit out there. At 20, Raheem Sterling believes he has earned a contract on a par with the big boys after a decent finish to last season that ended with a place in the England squad. Talented boy he is, but he was denied three times here by Manchester United’s brilliant keeper David de Gea. On each occasion, you backed de Gea. Brad Jones, brought in to replace Simon Mignolet in goal, was wrong-footed when Rooney put United in to an early lead. He never recovered. Liverpool goalkeeper Brad Jones (left) replaced Simon Mignolet but had a torrid afternoon for Liverpool . Balotelli could have had a hat-trick for Liverpool but was denied brilliantly three times by De Gea . Rooney (left), who scored United's first goal, protects the ball from the attention of Gerrard (right) Neither did Gerrard, the man caught out of position when he was dragged to the ball by the sight of Antonio Valencia bounding down the right wing. Rooney, his opposite number for the day in the boiler room, swept in United’s first. After that there was no way back for Liverpool. What has happened to Gerrard? He is a tormented soul again, wishing away the season after Rodgers confirmed again that his team is in transition. Even at the start of the second half, when you normally expect Gerrard to be showing some emotion and stirring his team-mates before kick-off, he was quiet and subdued. Then there was Mario Balotelli, brought on at the start of the second half to replace Adam Lallana. He could have had a hat-trick. He was denied, just like Sterling, by the brilliance of de Gea in United’s goal. Beating the Spaniard from close range is a formidable task these days.

Gerrard cut a dejected figure as he walked off the pitch at Old Trafford following his side's 3-0 defeat to United . After this it is all about saving Liverpool’s season and Rodgers must come up with some more answers this week. The trip to Dean Court on Wednesday for a Capital One Cup tie against Championship leaders Bournemouth is full of pitfalls. Eddie Howe’s team scored five against Cardiff and will fancy their chances of another scalp against Liverpool. After that it is on to Arsenal, the team they beat 5-1 at Anfield last season. This time, it feels like they are hanging on.","Liverpool were easily swept aside 3-0 at Old Trafford by Manchester United .

"A 'sadistic' asylum seeker who forced his former girlfriend to witness him stabbing her sister and her friend to death after she refused to take him back has been jailed for life. Afghan national Ahmad Otak laughed and spat on 17-year-old Kimberley Frank’s body after stabbing her 15 times at her home in Yorkshire while her sister Elisa watched helplessly. He then tied his ex-partner up with electrical flex and lured her friend Samantha Sykes, 18, to Kimberley’s flat in Wakefield, where he stabbed the teenager repeatedly before slitting her throat. 'Sadistic': Afghan asylum-seeker Ahmad Otak will serve a minimum of 34 years for the murders of Kimberley Frank and Samantha Sykes . Teenage victims: Samantha Sykes (left), 18, and Kimberley Frank (right), 17, were stabbed repeatedly by Afghan national Ahmad Otak at Kimberley's Wakefield flat . Otak, who admitted two counts of murder at a previous hearing at Leeds Crown Court, was ordered to serve a minimum of 34 years in jail by a judge who described the 21-year-old as an 'inadequate, controlling man', who 'out of childish jealousy and vicious spite murdered two women in cold blood'. Leeds Crown Court was told how Otak abducted his ex-girlfriend Elisa, 19, after killing the two women, using Miss Sykes' car to drive to Dover in a failed bid to flee to France. His plan was foiled when a fellow refugee managed to raise the alarm. After being arrested the murderer claimed he was aided in the killing by Elisa Frank, who he had planned to marry. Leeds Crown Court was told that Elisa had met Otak in a children's home after he arrived in the UK from Afghanistan in 2007, claiming he was 16 years old. The pair had an on-off relationship and had planned to marry in 2011, but when Otak became more controlling Miss Frank called off the wedding, the court heard. Prosecutor Richard Mansell QC said: 'He said that even if she didn't marry him she could not leave him. He told her that he would go crazy and would kill people.' 'He said that...she could not leave him. He told her that he would go crazy and kill people' Prosecutor Richard Mansell QC . He later claimed he was joking but . later threatened to kill Elisa, her friends and members of family - . including his eventual victims Samantha Sykes and Miss Frank's sister . Kimberley. 'He told her that if she stayed with him she would be saving lives,' Mr Mansell said. On one occasion after Elisa had . shouted at Otak he produced a knife and told her that if she screamed he . would sew her mouth shut. Mr.Mansell . said Elisa was too frightened to report what had happened to the police . but Samantha Sykes, 18, was not and reported Otak to the UK Border . Agency as an illegal immigrant and contacted police, but no action was . taken because Elisa declined to make a statement. In . September last year she finally decided to leave him for good but . relented when he threatened to throw acid in her face and petrol bomb . her mother's house. On one occasion Otak said he had prepared 'kill list' of 12 people he believed were trying to split the couple up. 'Horrific': Otak, left, stabbed Kimberley Frank (right with her sister Elisa Frank) to death at her home in Wakefield while her sister watched helplessly . In March this year Elisa Frank moved out of the flat they shared in Wakefield, West Yorks. On . March 9th after she demanded her belongings back from Otak, he went and . bought a carving knife and went to Kimberley's flat in Barden Road, . Wakefield, where she was with Elisa, who had again refused to go back to . Otak. All three were in . the hallway when Otak suddenly attacked Kimberley. 'He stabbed and . slashed her repeatedly with the knife in a frenzied attack,' said . Mr.Mansell. She had 15 wounds, the court heard including a massive stab wound to the neck. Scene: The bodies of murdered teenagers Kimberley Frank and Samantha Sykes were found at Miss Frank's flat in Wakefield . After . the killing Otak ordered Elisa to sit down and claimed she had made him . do it and if she had gone back to him it would not have happened. Otak took Miss Sykes car after he killed her and drove to to Dover in a bid to flee to France . Mr.Mansell said: 'At one point he stood over Kimberley's body, laughed, licked blood from the knife and spat on her. 'He . then told Elisa he was going to kill more people and made her send . several text messages to Samantha Sykes, asking her to come to the . flat.' He then tied Elisa . up with electrical flex. When Samantha arrived at the flat Otak let her . in and then attacked her, stabbing and slashing her repeatedly. After . the killings Otak took his ex-girlfriend and drove to Dover in Miss . Sykes' car in a bid to flee to France, but was arrested when an Iranian . illegal immigrant who was trying to get out of the UK helped Elisa get . free after she told him her story as they tried to board a lorry. After . his arrest Otak claimed he had carried out the killings for Elisa . 'whose plan it was', telling police 'she forced me to do this thing. She . said ""kill my sister and friend"".' He said he killed Samantha because she was a model and he was jealous of her. Mr.Jonathan . Turner QC, defending said that although the 'horror of his actions can . not be explained' he said they were the actions of a man not in full . control of his own mind.

"Saturday Night Live has used a sketch to condemn the recent Senate report revealing the CIA's torture techniques by interviewing the two 'psychologists' who headed up the program. During the opening of the NBC show an interviewer named Charlie Rose - played by Taran Kilam - speaks to the audience, criticizing the work of the intelligence agency. He says: 'The report is like a menu from the Cheesecake Factory. [It's] 660  sickening pages, yet I couldn't put it down.' Sketch: The opening of SNL saw two 'psychologists' who spearheaded the CIA's torture program interviewed. They said the effort was based on teamwork because 'there is no ""I"" in torture' Two fictitious psychologists, played by Bobby Moynihan and Kyle Mooney, are then introduced, claiming to have arranged the torture program - from which they reportedly received $80millon. Asked how responsible they felt, the pair said: 'It was teamwork, you have to remember, there is no ""I"" in torture.' They then talk about their career prospects, feeling they will be 'pigeonholed'. 'We don't want to be known as those rectal-feeding guys,' they add. The pair then go on to talk about other things they are responsible for in society - including the self-service checkout. Describing it as a form of 'torture', they say you are forced to scan your groceries yourself with a cashier watching. Then, at the end, the screen asks you to get a cashier. They also claimed to have done 'all customer service for Time Warner Cable'. The show was hosted by Martin Freeman who started the show by delving into current affairs. During his introduction speech he said: 'It is great to be in New York at Christmas. The Rockefeller Christmas Tree, Radio City Music Hall and, of course, racial unrest.' Condemnation: The interviewer, Charlie Rose, said the report read like a menu from 'The Cheesecake Factory, 660 sickening pages, yet I couldn't put it down . Later on he performed a sketch where he played Bilbo Baggins in the setting of the British version of The Office TV show. On Thursday CIA Director John Brennan said some agency officers used ""abhorrent"" methods on detainees captured following the Sept. 11 attacks and said it was ""unknowable"" whether harsh interrogation techniques yielded useful intelligence. With his agency under fire in the aftermath of a U.S. Senate report detailing the CIA's use of torture on detainees after the 2001 attacks, Brennan rejected the report's conclusion that the agency had deceived the White House, Congress and the public about its interrogation program.","An interviewer named Charlie Rose - played by Taran Kilam - speaks two men who spearheaded the project .

For a second straight year the leafy suburb has planned no . public events to commemorate the massacre, which left 20 first . graders and six educators dead at Sandy Hook Elementary School, . an incident that inflamed the U.S. debate over gun control. The parents of eight of the children killed in the December 14, . 2012, carnage, which 20-year-old gunman Adam Lanza ended by . shooting himself dead as he heard police sirens approach, have . notified Connecticut courts that they may file wrongful death . lawsuits in state or federal court. Dark day: Firefighters lower the American flag to half-staff along Main Street in Newtown, Connecticut on December 14, 2014. Today is the last day families of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting can file lawsuits . Bad memories: Parents of almost half the young children killed in the shooting by 20-year-old Adam Lanza two years ago planned to file lawsuits, it was confirmed this week .

Victims: This January 14, 2013 photo shows white roses with the faces of the Sandy Hook Elementary school shooting victims, attacked to a telephone pole near the school . Their initial court filings, related to legal entities . created in memory of their children, do not indicate who the . families could target in their lawsuits, according to a chief . court clerk for North Fairfield County Probate Court. However, it was reported that the families who spoke with attorneys at law firm Koskoff, Koskoff & Bieder planned to take legal action against gun manufacturer Bushmaster and the estate of the shooter's mother, according to the Hartford Courant. Nancy Lanza's estate is worth $64,000. While the parents could not be reached for comment, a . spokesman for Bridgeport law firm said that a lawyer at the firm had recently met with some of the . Newtown parents about potential suits. 'Attorney Josh Koskoff has met with parents about legal . action,' said Geraldo Parrilla, a legal assistant with the firm. While Newtown grabbed the nation's attention, school . shootings remain common across the United States. Some 95 . incidents, including fatal and nonfatal assaults, suicides and . unintentional shootings have taken place across 33 states since . Newtown, according to Everytown for Gun Safety, a group created . by the merger of Mayors Against Illegal Guns, founded by former . New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg and Moms Demand Action for Gun . Sense in America, a group founded after the attack. Mother and son: It's not yet certain the target of the lawsuits, but it has been speculated that the families could name gun manufacturer Bushmaster and the estate of shooter Adam Lanza's (right) mother Nancy (left) Still standing: Above, Nancy Lanza's home which was recently purchased by the city of Newtown. It's speculated that the town may tear down the building, like they did to the elementary school where the shooting took place. Nancy Lanza was the first of her son's victims on December 14, when she was shot dead inside the home . 'It's astounding,' said Shannon Watts, who founded the Moms . group. 'There is no other developed country that would tolerate . this kind of gun violence around school age children.' Gun-rights advocates note that the Second Amendment of the . U.S. Constitution protects the right to bear arms and suggested . after the attack that armed guards in schools could avert future . violence. Newtown, located some 78 miles northeast of . New York City, has razed the school that was site of the attack . and recently acquired the home where Lanza lived with his . mother, who he shot dead as the first act of his rampage. That . building may also be torn down. Newtown plans no public ceremonies to mark Sunday's . anniversary of the shootings. 'The second anniversary, like the first one last year, will . be recognized in personal reflection and remembrance,' said . Newtown's highest elected official, First Selectman Patricia .

"Scroll down for video . Marcus Mariota wrote it all down, every word of his Heisman Trophy acceptance speech. It was a good thing, too, because getting through it might have been tougher than sprinting away from a linebacker or tossing a touchdown pass for Oregon's understated star. The junior quarterback became the Ducks' first Heisman winner going away Saturday night, capping a three-year climb to college football's most prestigious individual award. 'I'm humbled to be standing here today,' Mariota said moments after he was announced as the winner. Winner, winner: University of Oregon quarterback Marcus Mariota was named the winner of the Heisman Trophy on Saturday. The Heisman is the highest individual prize award in college football . Kiss: Mariota, pictured at his trophy presentation ceremony at the New York Marriott Marquis on Saturday, is the first University of Oregon player and Hawaiian to win the award . Emotional: The quarterback teared up as he thanked his family for supporting his football ambitions in his acceptance speech on Saturday . Mariota isn't a bigger talker, but he steadily worked through his speech, thanking his teammates, teachers, friends and his home state of Hawaii. He finally hit a snag when it came time to thank his mother and father. He needed to take two deep breaths and still he got choked up. 'I had to give thanks to so many people because where I am today, it's all do to all those people,' Mariota said later. 'It's hard not to get emotional. It's been a long journey. My emotions got the best of me.' A pinpoint passer with wide-receiver speed, Mariota came into this season as the favorite to win the 80th Heisman and delivered a performance that turned the presentation ceremony at a theater in Times Square into a foregone conclusion. Mariota had twice as many points (2,534) as second-place finisher Melvin Gordon (1,250), the record-breaking running back from Wisconsin. The other finalist, Alabama receiver Amari Cooper, was third. Top spot: Mariota (right) was up against finalist Melvin Gordon (left), running back for the University of Wisconsin, and Amari Cooper (center), a University of Alabama receiver . Mariota received the second-highest percentage of possible points (90.92) in Heisman history, behind only Ohio State quarterback Troy Smith, who had 91.63 in 2006. Southern California tailback Reggie Bush received 91.77 percent of possible points in 2005, but his victory was later vacated for violating NCAA rules. Mariota, the first Hawaii native to win the Heisman, has accounted for a Pac-12-record 53 touchdowns (38 passing, 14 rushing and one receiving) while directing the Ducks' warp-speed spread offense. 'In Hawaii, if one person is successful, the entire state is successful,' he said, draped in leis at his news conference. It will be a matchup of Heisman-winning quarterbacks in the College Football Playoff's Rose Bowl semifinal January 1 with Mariota and the Ducks facing Florida State and Jameis Winston. 'I'm just looking forward to getting back on the field and playing again,' Mariota said. 'We do have a team goal.' High-scorer: Mariota has the second-highest percentage of possible points (90.92) in Heisman history, second only to Ohio State quarter back Troy Smith who had 91.63 in 2006. Pictured above in Oregon's September 6, 2014 game against Michigan State . Snap: Number 8 Mariota throws a pass as Tra'Mayne Bondurant  of the Arizona Wildcats goes in for the tackle during the first half of the PAC-12 Championships at Levi's Stadium on December 5, 2014 in Santa Clara, California . In an era when so many Heisman winners seemingly come from out of nowhere — the last two were the first freshmen winners — Mariota's rise was slow and steady. Three of the last four Heisman winners were in their first seasons as starters, including Cam Newton, who won the award in his only season at Auburn after transferring from a junior college. Before Newton, three straight sophomores won the award (Tim Tebow of Florida, Sam Bradford of Oklahoma and Mark Ingram of Alabama). Tebow was the first sophomore winner. Like Texas A&M quarterback Johnny Manziel and Winston, the previous two winners, Mariota started as a redshirt freshman. It quickly established himself as a star, but unlike Johnny Football and Famous Jameis, Mariota wasn't the face of college football in his first season. In his second season he put up numbers that rivaled those of Heisman finalist quarterbacks Winston, Manziel, AJ McCarron and Jordan Lynch, but when it came time to vote for the Heisman, Mariota was forgotten. He didn't even finish in the top 10 in 2013. This season Mariota would not be ignored. He leads the nation in passer rating (186.2), is fifth in total offense (342.5 yards per game) and has led the Ducks to a Pac-12 title with a chance to play for their first national championship. Of course, patience and poise have defined Mariota's career. He didn't start for his high school team until he was a senior — then led Saint Louis in Honolulu to a state title. Big shot: Mariota greets fans outside the Best Buy theater in New York City on Saturday, after he was named this year's Heisman Trophy winner . A quiet leader with a nice-guy reputation, Mariota brought no off-field baggage to this Heisman ceremony. After a season beset by off-field troubles, including a school hearing into sexual assault allegations, Winston wasn't a finalist this time around. He finished sixth. Oregon's only Heisman finalists before Mariota were quarterback Joey Harrington in 2001 and running back LaMichael James in 2010. 'If you have your punch list of things as a program, the most iconic individual award would be the Heisman Trophy. But like Marcus said, I know he'd trade all that to win as a team,' Oregon coach Mark Helfrich said. For Harrington, Oregon, with Nike's help, put up a billboard in Times Square to promote their Heisman candidate. Oregon didn't need a billboard to get the word out about Mariota. His play provided all the publicity he needed .","The University of Oregon junior was awarded the highest individual prize in college football on Saturday .

"A woman has given birth to conjoined twin boys just 11 months after delivering her first child. Michelle Brantley and fiance Bryan Mirabal were shocked when they discovered they had conceived six months after their Gage was born. On Friday, after 34 intense weeks of medical complications, Carter and Conner Mirabal, connected at the abdomen and facing each other, were born weighing 5lbs each. The boys required immediate surgery to repair damage to their stomachs but emerged from the theater in good condition. And in an unusual but optimistic circumstance, they do not appear to share any organs. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Miracle: Carter (right) and Conner (left) do not share organs which is rare for twins connected at the abdomen . Elated: Michelle Brantley was rushed to hospital early to give birth just 11 months after delivering her first son . The elated new parents wrote on Facebook: 'We are not out of the woods yet that was the best news we have heard [in] god knows how long!' The boys were delivered on Friday night in Jacksonville, Florida, after Ms Brantley was rushed to hospital a month before the original due date and five days before a recently-scheduled c-section. Shortly before midnight, she and Mr Mirabal welcomed their sons into the world - baby brothers for their first child Gage. The twins are expected to remain conjoined and have been transferred to a special care unit for observation where they remain on ventilators. Aside from their livers, which appear to be connected in some way, Carter and Conner appear to be functioning independently of each other, doctors said. Doing well: Doctors said the boys are in a stable condition in an observation unit after emergency surgery . Prognosis: The boys will remain conjoined while doctors and their parents discuss the best way forward . Adorable: Their foot prints were taken as Ms Brantley and fiance Bryan Mirabal celebrated the successful birth . And despite suffering minor heart complications at first, Carter's heart is strengthening. The survival rate for conjoined twins is between five and 25 per cent. Ms Brantley and Mr Mirabal have spent the pregnancy in constant contact with Atlanta couple Robin and Michael Hamby, whose conjoined twin sons died the day they were born on December 5. The Hamby boys - Asa and Eli - survived just 34 hours before developing an atrial flutter - where the heart beats of of sync - which sent their heart rate to 300 beats a minute. Ms Brantley had rescheduled her c-section for next week instead of January but went into labor on Friday . Hopes: The life expectancy of conjoined twins is low and the family is praying for the boys to pull through . Angelic: The happy couple have been documenting the entire pregnancy and each stage of the birth . Surprised! Ms Brantley shared a picture of her ballooning pregnant belly just days before her waters broke . Doctors tried to regulate the rhythm with drugs, but ultimately could not save the boys. Ms Brantley wrote a tribute to the Hamby family on Facebook: 'Our hearts go out to the Hamby family, although yalls precious baby boys only spent one day on earth, they will spend a life time watching over you guys from heaven above. 'We're praying for your family now and forever. Please everyone pray for the Hamby family, they need your prayers. R.I.P Angel babies! ‪#‎teamHamby‬.'

"A spectacular meteor shower lit up the skies last night with 100 shooting stars an hour as the celestial firework display reached its fiery peak. Sky-watchers across the world braved freezing temperatures to enjoy the Geminid meteor shower after astronomers said the weather conditions were close to perfect for the annual spectacle. Shooting stars were seen streaking across the night sky just after midnight in London and past the Dover Patrol Memorial in St Margarets Bay, Kent. The meteor shower was  visible in both hemispheres and was spotted from Skopje in Macedonia to Washington in the US because of the clear skies. At their height, the Geminids produce between 50 and 100 shooting stars every hour and they can be seen glowing in multiple colours with occasional rapid bursts of two or three. Scroll down for video . A spectacular meteor shower lit up the skies last night with 100 shooting stars an hour, pictured along the Isle of Wight west coast near Chale . Geminid meteors can shine in different colours and may appear red, blue, green, or yellow, as seen last night in Buckinghamshire . Photographer John Baker captured the heavenly display over the wilderness in Dartmoor, Devon, and said it was 'mesmerising' The best time to see the meteors was around 2am, when the point in the sky from which the meteors appear to originate - was almost overhead, next to the constellation Gemini. But meteors, which travel at more than 22 miles per second, should have been visible throughout the night from around 10pm as they burned up about 24 miles above the Earth. Robin Scagell, vice-president of the Society for Popular Astronomy, said: 'It should be a good display, weather permitting - we might not be far off perfect conditions in the UK. 'The constellation is very high in the sky and most of the Moon will have gone away. An average of one comet a minute would be a good rate, and that's possible. You might also get little bursts of activity with two or three together.'

Meteor showers occur when the Earth ploughs through clouds of cometary dust, pictured is a shooting star seen from north London . Meteor showers occur when the Earth ploughs through clouds of cometary dust. The tiny particles, some no bigger than a grain of sand, burn up brightly as they enter the atmosphere. Geminids are debris from an extinct three-mile-wide comet called 3200 Phaethon, which was previously believed to be an asteroid, according to NASA. 'Basically it is the rocky skeleton of a comet that lost its ice after too many close encounters with the sun,' NASA said on its website. But it has an eccentric orbit that looks more like that of a comet than an asteroid and brings it well inside the orbit of Mercury, the closest planet to the Sun, every 1.4 years. Traditionally asteroids are made of rock and comets mostly of ice, but NASA describes Geminids as a type of 'rock comet'. 'It's not as clear-cut as it used to be,' said Mr Scagell. 'A lot of asteroids are quite icy. There are asteroids that look a bit like comets and comets that look a bit like asteroids.'

Geminids are debris from an extinct three-mile-wide comet called 3200 Phaethon, pictured above Skopje, Macedonia, last night . The Geminid meteor shower was first noted in the 1860s, but over time it has become more intense. There were 20 comets per hour reported in the 1920s, rising to 50 in the 1930s, 60 in the 1940s and 80 in the 1970s. Another unusual feature of the Geminids is that they can shine in different colours. Mostly glowing white, they may also appear yellow, blue, green or red. Regardless of whether 3200 Phaethon is an asteroid or comet, it is classified as a 'potentially hazardous' near-Earth object (NEO). To be classified as potentially hazardous, an NEO must pass within 4.6 million miles of the Earth. Each year in December, the Earth is less than two million miles from Phaethon's orbit. At its closest upcoming approach on December 14 2093, the object will be 1,812,640 miles away - quite far enough to be safe. Photographer John Baker captured the heavenly display over the spectacular wilderness in Dartmoor, Devon. 'It was absolutely magnificent. The smaller meteors can be fairly common but the bigger ones are rarer and some of the bigger ones were just stunning.

Since leaving the E4 show that propelled her to fame, Ashley has been quietly building up her brand and she's got big plans for the future. The latest string to the model and presenter's bow? A range of stylish bangles inspired by her hometown of Chelsea. Scroll down for video . Killing two birds with one stone: Former Made In Chelsea star Ashley James models her new range of bangles, Whistle & Bango . Ashley established Whistle & Bango, a lifestyle brand that creates postcode bangles, with her friends Ania Kubow and Rosie Parkes. Ashley, who models the range herself in a set of smouldering campaign shots, opened up to FEMAIL about her brainchild, turbulent time on Made In Chelsea and her battle with depression. Speaking about Whistle & Bango, she said: 'We came up with the concept after realising how passionate people are about their own pockets of London. We decided on postcodes because because they’re quintessentially British, are so unique to see on jewellery, and they evoke a thousand memories. 'Each person has their own memories built into different areas and we wanted to allow people to celebrate their own stories and wear their heart on their wrist. 'At the same time as celebrating our communities we also want to support them and so we donate £1 of every bangle sale to SHP, a charity that helps homeless and vulnerable people.'

Ashley's bangles are loved by Laura Whitmore, Stephanie Pratt, Fifi Geldof, and even Judy Murray - but the star would love to see Paloma Faith, Fearne Cotton, Kate Upton, Cara Delevingne and Cressida Bonas donning her designs. Ashley, who also works in presenting and would love to design her own footwear range, is a huge fan of fashion, which is clear from her latest campaign. Speaking about her personal style, she said: 'I've been told my style is ""hobo chic"" - very low effort, a little bit bohemian. I would say I just wear what I like, and my style changes according to my mood.' Her mood, in particular her battle with depression, is something Ashley has spoken publicly about. 'It's been something I've struggled with to some degree since I was about fifteen,' she said candidly. 'But being on the show definitely accentuated it.' Celebrity favourite: The bangles are loved by Laura Whitmore, Stephanie Pratt and even Judy Murray - but the star would love to see  Kate Upton, Cara Delevingne and Cressida Bonas donning her designs . She continued: 'I'm so grateful to the show but I found it very difficult to have a relationship breakdown on television. 'The show was great to be a part of, and was full of highs and lows. The highs were incredible, and the lows were awful. I have very chilled out friends so I wasn't quite prepared for the drama. ''I'm in a really good place now though, the best I've ever been; I think I've finally learnt to cope with it. 'I'm really busy at the moment and am still in touch with the people I care about on the show so I don't miss it. I doubt I'd ever go back to it but Justin Bieber taught me to Never say Never. Opening up: Ashley has previously spoken about her battle with depression but says she's in a really good place now . Ashley is most certainly seizing all the opportunities that come her way, promising that 2015 is going to be a 'huge' year for her. 'There's lots of exciting things in the pipeline with our bangle company, as well as a few big modelling campaigns, and I'll be back on TV screens! I can't say too much at the moment,' she said. Despite her hectic work schedule, her New Year's resolution is 'learn to take time off'. 'I'm a bit of a workaholic, I've been known to work 18 hour days - that's the trouble with being self employed there's no one to send you home,' she said. 'I also want to be a bit more selfish. I sometimes try so hard to make others happy that I forget about myself.' Sharing her plans for the future, ambitious Ashley said: 'In five years time I hope that I'm happy and successful. I'd like to be a regular face for presenting work, my dream job is to do This Morning but whether it takes five years or 15 years, I know it's just a case of working hard. 'My friend Lilah Parsons and I always joke we are the next Holly Willoughby and Fearne Cotton so maybe we'll have our own panel show, too. 'I'm really passionate about women's health, both in terms of mental health and healthy body image, so I'd quite like to explore that passion too. Who knows, as long as I'm happy I don't mind.'

"A bipolar American man has denounced the United States at a press conference after apparently successfully swimming to North Korea on his second attempt to cross illegally into the country. Speaking at the event in Pyongyang on Sunday, Arturo Martinez, 29, who was raised in El Paso, Texas, claimed he managed to enter North Korea by swimming across the river border with China. According to his mother, it is the second time he has attempted to enter the country - he was previously stopped and shipped back to the U.S. after he was caught swimming across the water. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Speech: Speaking at a press conference in Pyongyang on Sunday, Arturo Martinez (pictured), 29, from El Paso, Texas, claimed he managed to enter North Korea by swimming across the river border with China . Addressing reporters, Martinez said he undertook the 'risky journey' to North Korea 'so I can pass along some very valuable and disturbing information' on America's domestic and foreign policy. 'I would like to reveal some facts about America's imperalistic influence and dominance, as well as much of its corrupt and threatening practices through which it has proven itself to have little or no regard for human rights or serving the greater good,' he said. But he added: 'I would like to offer a sincere apology to the leadership of the DPRK for knowingly having violated its nation's laws and boundaries by illegally entering as I did in such a foolish way.' He also said he was 'extremely grateful' for 'the  generous reception' he has received in North Korea. Martinez has apparently not been put into custody and is currently seeking asylum in Venezuela. Denouncing the U.S.: According to his mother, it is the second time he has attempted to enter the country - he was previously stopped and shipped back to the U.S. after he was caught swimming across the river . Following the U.S. citizen's first attempt to enter the country, he was placed in a California psychiatric hospital, CNN reported. However, he was later approved for release by a judge. 'He is very smart and he got the court to let him out and instead of coming home to us he bought a ticket and left for China. He took out a payday loan online and left,' his mother, Patricia Martinez, said. She added that the U.S. Embassy in Beijing was looking for her son, whom she described as 'mentally unstable' and a sufferer of bipolar disorder. Details of Martinez's latest attempt to enter North Korea - including how and when he got into the country - were not immediately clear.. Press conference: Addressing reporters, Martinez said he undertook the 'risky journey' to North Korea 'so that I can pass along some very valuable and disturbing information I feel this government would appreciate' Determined: Details of Martinez's attempt to enter North Korea - including how and when he got there - were not clear. He says he entered North Korea by swimming across the river border (pictured) with China . In September, South Korean media reported that a man in his late 20s had been arrested by South Korean marines for swimming in a river that flows towards North Korea. The man had been trying to go to the North to meet its leader, local media reported at the time. Martinez made his comments at the People's Palace of Culture, which North Korean officials have used in recent years to present North Korean defectors who have returned there. On at least one occasion, they have also presented a South Korean citizen who was detained in North Korea. The Palace is also used for signing ceremonies between North Korea and other countries. Martinez's comments came amid North Korea's own  protests of a resolution in the UN that could open the door for its leaders to face charges of crimes against humanity for human rights violations. This raises questions of whether Martinez was trotted out to the media for propaganda purposes. North Korea recently released three Americans - two who had entered the country on tourist visas and Kenneth Bae, a Korean-American missionary who had been convicted of ""anti-state"" crimes.","Arturo Martinez, 29, 'swam to North Korea via river border with China'

Nestled next to a babbling brook in the quaint town of Castleton in Derbyshire, Mike Clarke's Hidden Tea Room should be packed to the rafters. But he's become a cult figure on TripAdvisor because his customer's experiences are so awful -  with one branding it a 'filthy hovel' and the 'worst place on earth!' Locals warn people to steer clear of the place and even staff at the nearby tourist information shop winced when we asked for directions there. Scroll down for video . Brusque: Mike Clarke, the owner of the Hidden Tea Room in Castleton, Derbyshire, has become famous for his rudeness towards customers . Reviews on TripAdvisor are scathing and include phrases like 'filthy hovel' and 'the worst place on earth' 'It's called the Hidden Tea Room and it should stay that way – hidden,' warned one local. Another said: 'He's a bit of a character to say the least and really not very nice. He's really rude to customers and scares people away.' The Tea Room has 127 reviews on the site, with 100 deeming it 'terrible,' nine 'poor' and seven 'average.' Only three people found it 'excellent' and eight 'very good'. Visitors tell of being snarled at for only ordering drinks, refused water, shouted at to leave for being hikers as he didn't need their money and even being reduced to tears. When one woman asked to use the toilet he reportedly handed her a bucket and newspaper. Others said the owner was 'rude, 'nasty' and 'dirty', that going there was like being in a League Of Gentleman sketch and a 'horrifying' experience. Visitors tell of being snarled at for only ordering drinks, refused water, shouted at to leave for being hikers as he didn't need their money and even being reduced to tears . Bizarre: A display at the venue. Some people enjoyed their visit as it was an 'experience' Despite being situated in the Peak District, Mr Clarke has utter contempt for hikers who visit . But defiant Mr Clarke has hit back at the claims. He said: 'I don't give a s*** what people have to say on the internet. 'The comments on TripAdvisor are just moaning prats being nasty. If people want to know what it's like here they should come and see if for themselves. 'There are some customers I don't want in here - the ones who don't spend any money. 'I get walkers come in and order one pot of tea between two of them for two quid. Why would I let them take up a table when it could be filled with people eating and spending money? 'Yes, I'll tell them they can't come in if they're not eating. I go to a lot of effort with my food. If people are coming here because they've read bad reviews on TripAdvisor, as long as they're willing to spend money then I'm happy. The Tea Room has 127 reviews on TripAdvisor, with 100 deeming it 'terrible,' nine 'poor' and seven 'average' 'People might think I'm a cantankerous old thing but I'm old school. I'm used to decent people, like caravanners, who will pay for quality. I've been in business here for 11 years and survived the recession, so I can't be that bad. 'I just don't want people coming in wanting something for nothing and then going away and moaning on the internet.' Now reviewers on Trip Advisor are starting to see the funny side. One, named fiftyandchildfree posted last weekend: 'Our main impression was being in a (cold) timewarp with a grumpy Santa moaning about how Castleton was going down the pan, mostly because of hikers not spending anything. 'Whilst I wouldn't recommend this place for the food or ambience, it is an experience that others might like to share - it kept us amused for some time afterwards which is more than you can say for the average cafe/tea shoppe.' Another, SomeSamP added: 'I think the trouble with this place is its best just discovered by following the hand-written advert scrawled on a piece of wood, and then just accepting and enjoying the bizarre experience - after reading reviews most people wouldn't go, but we had a lot of fun.'","Castleton's Hidden Tea Rooms has been branded a 'filthy hovel'

"A Texas man has been arrested in the kidnapping of a 23-year-old woman, it emerged Saturday. Suspect Enrique Arochi, 24, was apprehended that day and faces an aggravated kidnapping charge, WFAA reported. The charge is in relation to the disappearance Christina Morris, according to the affiliate station. Where is she? Christina Morris, pictured, was last seen with Enrique Arochi in a parking garage on August 30 . According to WFAA, DNA evidence had been linked to a vehicle belonging to Arochi - and it was towed on the day of his arrest. David Tilley, a spokesman for the Plano Police Department, told the affiliate station 'The DNA evidence and the details that surround that... if we were able to release that, you would understand it more. Unfortunately, we're unable to release that.' Tilley also said 'We have nothing to show evidence one way or another whether [Christina Morris is] dead or alive at this point in time.' Arochi's bail was set at $1million, the affiliate station reported. He previously told WFAA 'I feel they are wasting their time on me when they can be looking at somebody else that is actually the suspect, or the person that actually did it.' Morris was last seen with him in a parking garage on August 30, which was picked up by security camera footage, according to the media outlet. Suspect: Enrique Arochi, pictured, has been charged with aggravated kidnapping . Christina Morris, who went missing in August, has still not been found by authorities . WFAA reported that last month Arochi had been charged with interfering with the investigation. Referring to Arochi, Tilley told the affiliate station, 'A lot of deception on his part that we believe was intentional, that created problems with our investigation.' CBS Dallas Fort Worth, citing a warrant, reported that bodily fluids, hair and DNA evidence were sought by authorities when examining Arochi's vehicle. Morris' mother Jonni McElroy told Star Local Media 'I’m overwhelmed with excitement that our work, I believe, is eventually going to come to a closure and we'll get the answers that we need. She continued 'In my heart I feel like we’re going to celebrate Christmas with her. ... We’re still going to worry, but ... I have a little bit of sparkle that’s shining through my heart right now.'","Enrique Arochi, 24, was apprehended Saturday and faces an aggravated kidnapping charge .

"A morgue left the corpse of a 95-year-old woman rotting in a freezer for a year after sending the wrong body to be cremated, it has emerged. Leah Lehrer's family buried what they believed to be their relative's ashes in a cemetery in Queens, New York, days after she died on January 25. But this week an inspector discovered Mrs Lehrer's decomposing body on the premises of the mortuary in midtown Manhattan - where bosses have spent months searching for a missing corpse. Scandal: A New York City morgue left the body of Leah Lehrer, 95, in their freezer for a year after apparently sending that of Rebecca Alper, 71, to Mrs Lehrer's funeral . The discovery, reported in the New York Post, appears to confirm that the body of 71-year-old Rebecca Alper, who committed suicide in September 2013, was sent for cremation instead of Mrs Lehrer's. However, the morgue's directors and city health officials have been unable to explain why the body was not sent for a city burial after three months, as it protocol with unclaimed corpses. The scandal has sparked outrage and prompted an internal investigation of the Medical Examiner's Office as it happened after city officials paid $10.9 million in taxpayer money for new 'body-tracking' software. Directors began to uncover the full scale of the mix-up in May when Rebecca Alper's family enquired about their relative's remains. The Medical Examiner's Office exhumed 300 bodies buried on Hart Island in a desperate bid to find Mrs Alper's body, to no avail. They have now delivered Mrs Lehrer's body to her family. 'We put the ashes in a package, dug a hole, said a prayer and put her in there,' first cousin Iris Familant told the Post. 'It's like she came back from the grave,' said another cousin, Joyce Liebman, also in an interview with the paper.","Leah Lehrer, 95, was 'cremated' in January, 'buried' in Queens, New York .

"Shirley Temple was the personification of innocence as the curly-haired and dimpled star of movies like 'Heidi', but as a grown-up mother she faced much darker realities. Following Temple's death at the age of 85 on February 10, a source has revealed how the former child-star saved her daughter from drug addition. Lori Black, who was Temple's daughter with second husband Charles Black, got hooked on heroin after entering the punk rock scene of the late 80s. When the child star became a mom: Shirley Temple, America's first child star (pictured in the 1930s on the right), died on February 10 from natural causes (On the left in 2006). A source recently told the National Enquirer about how Temple saved her daughter from an early grave after Lori Black got addicted to heroin . Addicted: Daughter Lori Black was a part of the West Coast punk rock scene of the 80s and 90s. In 1993 he joined The Melvins (right) but continued to battle a heroin addition . Shirley and her little girl: Lori was Temple's daughter with second husband Charles Black. Pictured above in June 1956 at the Black family's home in Atherton, California . 'Lori had a difficult relationship with her mother growing up,' a source told the National Enquirer. 'But when the chips were down, Shirley helped put Lori in rehab and supported her recovery wholeheartedly. She saved her daughter's life!' Apparently Black was hospitalized twice for drug abuse but struggled staying clean. She started out playing in San Francisco punk band Crown Alley, but in 1993 became the bassist for The Melvins after dating guitarist Buzz Osborne. It was while traveling with The Melvins in February 1993 that Lori, nicknamed 'Lorax', was busted for drug possession at the airport in Portland, Oregon. The following December, when she was 39, Black pleaded guilty to one count of possessing heroin and a second count was dropped when she agreed to two years probation, 120 hours of community service and to pay a fine of $385. Mom and dad: Shirley Temple pictured with Charles Black, Lori's father, in January 1953 . The Temple family: Temple and Black had two children together, Lori (center) and Charles Jr (right). She also had another daughter, Susan (left), with first husband John Agar . The sentence also required she attend drug therapy sessions three times a week and submit to random drug screenings. In a show of mercy, the court let her enter rehab in northern California, where her parents lived and mother Shirley visited all the time. The source said Temple blamed herself for her daughter's downfall, even though it 'wasn't really her fault'. Temple even had the whole family go through therapy together so Lori wouldn't have to do it alone. While there was a rumor Lori died of a heroin overdose in 1998, records show she is alive and well living in San Francisco and working as a photographer after getting sober with her mom's help. She is now 59. 'For Shirley, helping Lori beat her heroin addiction was the most important thing ever,' the source said. America's first child star: While Temple was best-known for her career as a child star, she insisted that being a mom was her greatest accomplishment .","After her career as America's first child star, Shirley Temple went on to have a family of her own .

"The airline executive whose 'nut rage' delayed an international flight today tried to apologise to two flight attendants - but they weren't in. Heather Cho visited the homes of the two cabin crew to beg forgiveness for her actions aboard a Korean Air flight from New York to Seoul. Both were out, BBC News reported. She left each a note instead. Scroll down for videos . Shamed: Heather Cho pictured on Friday apologising outside the offices of the Aviation and Railway Accident Investigation Board of the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport, in Seoul, South Korea . Chastened: Miss Cho, who until last week had been chief of in-flight service for Korean Air, caused a Korean Air flight to be delayed after she flew into a rage when she was served macadamia nuts in a bag . Miss Cho, who until the incident had been chief of in-flight service for Korean Air, caused flight KE086 to be delayed after she flew into a rage when she was served macadamia nuts in a bag. Korean Air protocol is for the nuts to be served on a small dish. Head steward Park Chang-jin claims Miss Cho insulted him and forced him to kneel in apology. 'In a situation where she said 'Make contacts right now to stop the plane. I won't let the plane go', I dared not object to her, the owner's daughter,' he told Korean state-run TV network KBS on Friday . The pilot brought the plane back to its gate at John F. Kennedy International Airport for the chief steward to be expelled. The flight's arrival at Incheon Airport, near Seoul, was delayed by 11 minutes as a result. Miss Cho is the eldest daughter of the company chairman Cho Yang-ho. Two siblings are also executives at the airline. Mr Park claims she swore at him, jabbed him with a file case and pointed her finger at him as he kneeled. The plane was already in the process taxiing to the runway for a 12.50am departure, but returned to the passenger terminal after Miss Cho demanded the chief steward's removal from the flight. 'The chief flight attendant failed to get the right manual, and this led Cho to believe he was not qualified for that job,' a Korean Air official told the Korean Times last week. Humbled: On the demands of Miss Cho, whose family own Korean Air, the pilot brought the plane back to its gate at New York's John F.

She bowed and offered a public apology before being questioned at the transport ministry in Seoul on Friday.

"Older people should use Facebook and other social media websites to prevent their health declining, a study has found. Pensioners who spend time online do not feel as lonely as others their age, which could stunt deterioration of physical and mental health, according to the research. The results of the study, carried out among 65 to 95-year-old's by researchers at the University of Exeter, could help cope with the health problems of an increasingly ageing population, experts said. The study, carried out among pensioners aged 65 to 95, found using the internet improved the group's social skills and competence (file image) Among ways to use the web to improve mental health was video calling and using social media via touch screen computers. A group of pensioners from 31 residential care homes across the UK were followed as part of the study funded by the EU. Those trained to use the technology felt more self-competent, were more sociable and showed improved cognitive abilities. Experts said using the internet could improve mental health among the elderly (file image) The project's leader, Dr Thomas Morton, said the findings highlighted how loneliness among the elderly can contribute to poor health. 'Human beings are social animals, and it’s no surprise that we tend to do better when we have the capacity to connect with others. 'But what can be surprising is just how important social connections are to cognitive and physical health. 'People who are socially isolated or who experience loneliness are more vulnerable to disease and decline.' One participant said learning how to navigate her way through the internet had 'changed her life'. 'Having this training changes people's lives and opens up their worlds, invigorates their minds and for lots of us gives us a completely different way of recognising our worth as we age,' said Margaret Keohone. 'I was just slipping away into a slower way of life.' Emma Green, one of the carers from Somerset Care Ltd, one of the homes taking part in the survey, said: 'As the training programme developed with my participants their confidence grew and they were keen to tell me how family members had emailed back, Skyped or ""liked"" a comment or a picture on Facebook. 'Seeing the smiles on my participant's faces when they Skuped a family member in the UK or abroad was such a special moment.'","People aged 65-95 took part in the study by the University of Exeter .

'You go out against Bournemouth [in Wednesday's Capital One Cup quarter-final] and then you have Arsenal. He was manager of the year but he has to get results. 'You expect them to do well after spending that kind of money. They are looking to be in the top four but they have failed in the Champions League. 'It will be hard to catch United because they are not in Europe. Arsenal will be going for fourth as well. If they don't get top four then he will be under pressure.'

"A bull which was destined for the slaughterhouse after a vet said he is gay but was granted a last minute reprieve following an intervention from a Simpsons creator has arrived at his new home. Benjy the gay bull has today arrived at his new home at Hillside Sanctuary, Norwich, where he will undergo the snip before living out the rest of his days in peace thanks to  terminally ill The Simpsons co-creator Sam Simon. And within seconds of his arrival Benjy experienced his first kiss - from Alex the one year old bullock living in the next door pen on the farm. Scroll down for video . The look of love? Benjy the gay bull was warmly welcomed to his new home at a Norwich sanctuary by Alex . Benjy arrives at his new home after being saved by fundraisers including Simpsons co-creator Sam Simon . Before Benjy can completely relax at the sanctuary he will have to undergo castration to calm him down . Benjy had been just days away from death after his owner became frustrated when he would not breed, but was  saved following a fundraising appeal which included a generous contribution from Mr Simon. But before the bull can completely relax he will have to undergo castration to calm him down and stop him terrorising the other animals. John Watson, who works at the sanctuary, told Newstalk: ‘We will castrate Benjy, because once you castrate them you don’t tend to notice their sexual preferences so much – it settles them down.' He added: ‘We’ve got three really gentle elderly cows that are going to be next to him in the barn.’ Benjy had been destined for the butchers after he failed to show any interest in the female cows on his farm in County Mayo and instead seemed to gravitate towards the other bulls. The bull was  saved by fundraisers including Simpsons co-creator Sam Simon (pictured) A vet told his owner that it was Benjy's sexual orientation that was the reason he wouldn't and couldn't breed. But Hollywood producer and long-term vegan Mr Simon heard about his plight and bought the animal's freedom by donating £5,000 to buy and transport Benjy to a sanctuary in time for Christmas. Mr Simon, who was diagnosed with terminal cancer in 2012, recently said that he would give away his entire $100million fortune on animal rights causes. Mr Simon said: 'PETA told me about Benjy, and I felt compelled to help. All animals have a dire destiny in the meat trade, but to kill this bull because he's gay would've been a double tragedy. 'It thrills me to help PETA and ARAN make Benjy's fate a sanctuary rather than a sandwich.' Mr Simon was diagnosed with terminal cancer in 2012 and has chosen to use his money and the time he has left to help animals in need. This includes getting 17 bears transferred from virtually barren concrete pits to a lush new home, helping retire a lame horse used for racing and securing the transfer of a chimpanzee who had spent more than 18 years in solitary confinement at a zoo to a reputable sanctuary. He also runs The Sam Simon Foundation, an organisation dedicated to rescuing and rehabilitating homeless dogs. Given three months to live in 2012, Mr Simon immediately decided to team up with People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) president Ingrid Newkirk, and dedicate his time to the rescue of maltreated animals and conservation. Benjy is currently blissfully unaware that before he settles in at the sanctuary, he must undergo castration . Benjy meets his new neighbours - three gentle elderly cows that are going to be next to him in the barn . Having defied that diagnosis’ original death sentence, Simon continues to push ahead and has also funded projects such as 'Feeding Families' to help with the underprivileged in inner cities. In addition to the money fronted by Simon, more than 250 other individuals have donated to fund the bull's transfer via a crowd-funding initiative set up by Irish animal-protection group ARAN and TheGayUK.com.

"Global climate talks have been rescued from the brink of collapse – but leave a gaping loophole which could allow countries to continue polluting the atmosphere. Negotiations overran by 31 hours as politicians from 192 countries struggled to reach agreement on the ground rules for a new climate treaty. A fortnight-long United Nations summit in Peru had aimed to lay the framework for new international laws to slow the pace of global warming. But the discussions became bad tempered as countries bickered over who should bear responsibility for reducing carbon emissions, whether richer nations should reduce pollution more quickly and how much aid they should pay to help poor countries adapt to global warming. Scroll down for video . Environmental activists wearing puppet faces representing, from left, Australia's Prime Minister Tony Abbott, Canada's Prime Minister Stephen Harper, Russia's President Vladimir Putin, China's President Xi Jinping, Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi perform during the Climate Change Conference COP20 in Lima, Peru . Eventually, they agreed to a watered-down deal which postpones the most difficult decisions for 12 months. The final treaty, which is due to be signed in Paris in 12 months, will be the first international climate agreement since the 1997 Kyoto Protocol. Energy secretary Ed Davey, who led the 45-strong British delegation in Lima, hailed the compromise agreement as a fundamental step to ensure all nations reduce their climate emissions. Speaking in the early hours of Sunday morning Lima, he said: ‘We have been up all night, we have sweated to get this deal. ‘We have unlocked the door to the big climate change deal we need in Paris next year.’ Negotiations overran by 31 hours as politicians from 192 countries struggled to reach agreement on the ground rules for a new climate treaty . But he admitted that even if the draft is strengthened over the next 12 months, it may not actually be enforceable. Britain’s own Climate Change Act forces us to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions 80 per cent by 2050 – driving a boom in wind farms and solar panels as a result. Negotiators hope to force other nations to adopt similar targets in a legally-binding treaty. Mr Davey had repeatedly insisted that all countries should provide clear, detailed pledges of the action they will take well in advance of next December’s summit. US Secretary of State John Kerry delivers a speech during the United Nations summit in Peru . But in the final negotiation the language of the agreement was softened. Whereas before it had insisted that countries ‘shall provide’ details about their emissions, in the final version it said they ‘may include’ the information ‘as appropriate’ to their circumstances. Critics said this is a major loophole which may allow nations such as Australia – which is critical of the UN process – to wriggle out of the deal. Mr Davey, however, insisted it was a clear victory to include any request for nations to provide quantifiable information about their emission reduction plans. ‘There are no penalties and sanctions with this stuff, it is about political pressure,’ he said. ‘Any deal we get in Paris next year will not be enforced by fines and sanctions, it will be enforced by political pressure.’ But Alden Meyer, director of policy at the Union of Concerned Scientists lobby group, said the language left room for nations to wriggle out of the deal. ‘It means it is totally up to everyone now whether they provide that information or not,’ he said. Lord Nicholas Stern, of the London School of Economics, welcomed progress made at the summit – but he said the Paris treaty will fail to stop drastic global warming because it has come too late. He said: ‘It is already clear that the scale of action to control and reduce annual emissions of greenhouse gases will collectively not be consistent with a pathway that will mean a reasonable chance of avoiding dangerous global warming of more than 2C above pre-industrial level.’ Previous hopes for a climate deal peaked in 2009 at Copenhagen, before the talks fell apart in fierce bickering. Negotiators have been trying to build bridges ever since. Jonathan Grant, director of climate change at PricewaterhouseCoopers, said: ‘The climate talks almost ground to a halt here in Lima. Progress outside the process failed to translate to progress inside the negotiating hall. Former U.S. Vice-President Al Gore speaks during a plenary session at the 20th UN Climate Change Conference. The final treaty, which is due to be signed in Paris in 12 months, will be the first international climate agreement since the 1997 Kyoto Protocol . The Lima summit was overshadowed by a controversial publicity stunt by Greenpeace, in which damage was done to the ancient Nazca Lines in southern Peru . ‘Brinkmanship is normal in these negotiations, but there's concern that the talks will fall off the cliff in Paris, like they did in Copenhagen.’ The Lima summit was overshadowed by a controversial publicity stunt by Greenpeace, in which damage was done to the ancient Nazca Lines in southern Peru. Peruvian ministers said the activists had permanently damaged the 1,500-year-old carvings while laying a banner calling for action at the summit. The conference, attended by 12,500 delegates, green activists and journalists, suffered another setback when it emerged it had produced more carbon emissions than any other summit in the 20-year history of the negotiations. More than 50,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide were emitted – more than the entire populations of Sierra Leone or Barbados over the same period – partially because plans to run the conference on green energy fell through and organisers had to rely on dirty diesel generators.

Liberal Democrat minister Ed Davey has accused the Tories of abandoning their green convictions in fear of Ukip. Five years after they promised to ‘Vote Blue, Go Green,’ the Conservatives have changed their stance as they pander to climate-sceptic Ukip, Mr Davey said.

Mr Davey is furious that Amber Rudd, the minister for climate change, was stopped by Conservative whips last week from accompanying him to a UN climate summit in Peru. As part of the trip, Miss Rudd was scheduled to visit a glacier in the Andes to highlight the dangers of global warming - a media stunt that would have had echoes of David Cameron’s much-ridiculed ‘hugging a husky’ visit to the Arctic in 2006. Speaking in Lima as the climate summit drew to a close yesterday, Mr Davey said many Tories had abandoned environmental convictions they vaunted at the last election. In an interview with the Daily Mail, he said: ‘There are some Conservatives who see this issue as a way of chasing Ukip votes. ‘That is deeply regrettable because you need to be consistent and you need to hold to your principles. ‘Just because some extreme party comes on the scene, doesn’t mean you suddenly change your policies.’ David Cameron famously coaxed his party into a position of ‘green conservatism’ soon after he took leadership of the party in 2005. He travelled on husky sleds across a remote Norwegian glacier to see first-hand the effects of global warming, proclaiming that he wanted to lead a ‘new green revolution and recapture climate change from the pessimists’. But his party has shifted substantially on green issues since then, promising a cap on new on-shore wind farms, slashing subsidies for solar panels and weakening protection of the green belt. Last year Mr Cameron was infamously reported as ordering officials to cut environmental levies and ‘get rid of the green c**p’. Critics point to the influence of Lynton Crosby, Mr Cameron’s strategist, who has shifted the party’s emphasis in a bid to deal with the electoral threat from Ukip. A Liberal Democrat source said: ‘The Tory green wash continues to fade. ‘From trying to halt onshore wind to slapping a banning order on attendance at crucial climate change talks, the Tory high command is in reverse gear when it comes to the green agenda.’ Mr Davey accused the Conservatives of consciously distancing themselves from green issues they held dear at the 2010 election in response to a threat from the right. ‘I’m not suggesting the Prime Minister is, but I think there are clearly some Tories who think that moving away from their position on green issues is now a vote winner,’ he said. Mr Davey also demanded that chief whip Michael Gove explain why he barred Miss Rudd’s trip to Lima. ‘I know Amber was disappointed and Mr Gove will no doubt want to explain to his colleagues why he thought it was important for her to remain in Westminster,’ he told a press conference in Lima. ‘She is an excellent climate change minister. She was due to go and see the problems caused by climate change to a glacier here in Peru. ‘Her trip would have helped illustrate why we are all here and why we are taking climate change so seriously.’","Talks overran by 31 hours as politicians struggled to reach agreement .

"Leicester City director of football Terry Robinson has been sacked following the club's alarming slide down table. Robinson was informed of the decision by chief executive Susan Whelan, with the Foxes having gone 11 games without a Premier League victory. Leicester are rock-bottom of the Barclays Premier League following a run of eight defeats in nine games and Robinson has paid the price for that poor form. Terry Robinson, pictured when chairman of Sheffield United, has been sacked as Leicester City's director of football following the club's alarming slide down the Premier League table . Leicester City boss Pearson sits in the stands during his side's 1-0 loss against Manchester City . Sportsmail understands the decision to axe Robinson is based purely on footballing reasons and nothing to do with allegations that he made a racist remark to a member of staff earlier this year. He survived inquiries by both his club and the FA over the alleged incident - as revealed by Sportsmail in September. It was claimed Robinson, a former FA international committee member and Sheffield United chairman, described a Leicester employee as a ‘darkie’ while in a group conversation at the training ground. Frank Lampard scored the opener to put Man City 1-0 up against struggling side Leicester . There was enough concern around the club, including among some of the players when they found out about it, for the FA to be informed by a third party. The FA took the claim seriously enough to conduct a thorough inquiry. However, it was found there was no case to answer because none of those involved had made a complaint. Leicester conducted their own probe following the FA’s verdict and came to the same conclusion. Sportsmail understands that Nigel Pearson's job is not under threat with belief at the club that not enough players were signed in the summer. A Leicester statement read: 'Leicester City Football Club has terminated the contract of its Director of Football, Terry Robinson. He departs with immediate effect and with the best wishes of everyone at the Football Club. 'Current Academy Director Jon Rudkin will assume the responsibilities of Director of Football. 'Jon has been with Leicester City Football Club for 16 years, has headed the Club’s Academy - recently awarded the Elite Player Performance Plan’s Category One status - since 2003 and has an excellent understanding of the Club's footballing philosophy and values. 'The owners, directors, management and staff at Leicester City would like to place on record our collective thanks to Terry for his work and contribution, and wish him well in future.'","Leicester City have sacked director of football Terry Robinson .

"A hockey commentator has been forced to apologize after offending viewers with a joke about the national police brutality protests.

'I thought Jay the Penguins would have to put on those ""I Can’t Breathe"" T-shirts for a while, because Columbus was suffocating,' Savran said. Co-host Jay Caufield clearly didn't see the joke coming, since he looked visibly shocked at the reference and didn't address the line as he proceeded ahead in the game analysis.

"Rio Ferdinand has suffered unfair abuse over his QPR performances due to his celebrity status, according to Harry Redknapp. Rangers boss Redknapp believes summer recruit Ferdinand has been singled out for undeserved criticism as the Loftus Road club fight for a Premier League foothold. Ferdinand became embroiled in a war of words with the chairman of anti-racism group Kick It Out Herman Ouseley this week after the publication of his latest autobiography, '£2sides'. Rio Ferdinand (above) suffers unfair abuse because of his celebrity status, according Harry Redknapp . The former Manchester United defender has clashed with Kick It Out over John Terry's trial for alleged racist abuse against Anton Ferdinand. Chelsea captain Terry was cleared in court in July 2012, but issues around the case resurfaced with Ferdinand's new book. Redknapp defended his centre-back, claiming the 35-year-old's off-field interests do not hurt his top-flight prowess, ahead of his 500th Premier League appearance this weekend. 'You'll always pick on the big players,' said Redknapp. Ferdinand (left) has been criticised for some of his performances in a QPR shirt . Redknapp defended his centre-back, claiming the 35-year-old's off-field interests do not hurt his prowess . 'I didn't see him make too many mistakes last week. He clipped a ball that got turned over and they ended up scoring a world class goal. 'It's probably because he's high-profile. That's the biggest problem. 'Joey's on Twitter and Rio wrote a book. It happens all of the time. Lots of footballers do it, like Wayne Rooney. What can you do? They are high profile now. It's part of the game. 'I don't think it's fair. We've been a bit open and we need to tighten up. I've got no problems with Rio.' Redknapp will lead a clutch of ex-Hammers returning to Upton Park for QPR's Premier League clash with West Ham on Sunday. Rio Ferdinand took part in a Q&A session hosted by Clare Balding to launch his new book . The former West Ham manager said he expects Ferdinand, Bobby Zamora, and Rob Green to relish their East London return. 'Hopefully we can go back there and pick up a good result,' he said. 'I'm sure there's an added motivation. They go back there and want to play well. 'All my memories were from going there as a kid. It's a special football club for me.' Ferdinand was at the Mayfair Hotel in London to launch his #2sides . Redknapp first managed Ferdinand at West Ham and said the ex-England defender was always destined for the top. 'He was only 15 and I saw the potential in him then,' said Redknapp. 'I said he would be the best defender in Europe because he was on another level. I knew he was going to be a big player.'","Harry Redknapp believes Rio Ferdinand gets a raw deal due to his celebrity status .

"Brendan Rodgers admitted he was managing a fractured dressing room after Liverpool’s 3-0 defeat at a resurgent Manchester United. Wayne Rooney, Juan Mata and Robin van Persie inflicted Liverpool’s seventh defeat of the Barclays Premier League season to move within five points of Manchester City in second. Rodgers, who faces a tricky Capital One Cup quarter-final at Bournemouth on Wednesday, is struggling to find solutions after this latest defeat. Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers looks down after his side's 3-0 defeat at Old Trafford . Raheem Sterling shows frustration after another missed opportunity during the difficult defeat . The Liverpool manager said: ‘We have to recapture the team ethos. With the emphasis of the team, it is clear to me that we are searching to find solutions. ‘The players are working hard, the players have given everything, they are pressing and they are working. ‘In every dressing room there have always been been issues, but it is not something I discuss outside of the dressing room. The players are honest but we are not getting results. Rodgers says his players are honest, and will keep working hard to get results as the season goes on . Rodgers, who chose to field Sterling as his central striker, admitted there is tension in the dressing room . ‘I can’t fault the commitment of the players because they gave everything.’ Rodgers axed Belgian keeper Simon Mignolet and replaced him with Brad Jones for the trip to Old Trafford and also changed to a 3-4-3 system. It played straight into United’s hands and Louis van Gaal’s team, who have now won six games in a row, were 2-0 up at the break. Rodgers added: ‘Simon has been fine, I spoke to him after the Basle game in the Champions League and he understood it. 'Brad Jones didn’t have much to do and he’s ending up picking the ball out of the net three times. Brad Jones, who replaced Simon Mignolet in the Liverpool goal, had no chance with Juan Mata's header . Rodgers was upset with the second goal, which was clearly some way offside, but missed by the linesman . Rodgers pointed to David de Gea's excellent performance as one of the reasons for his side's defeat . ‘This will be for an indefinite period. In my first year Brad did well and sometimes coming out of the firing line can help. ‘I just felt after Basle game that there was a chance to make the decision.’ Rooney scored United’s first goal but their next, scored by Mata, should have been disallowed for offside. Van Persie wrapped it up for United after the break with a clinical strike. Despite the emphatic scoreline, United keeper David de Gea was man of the match for a string of excellent saves from Mario Balotelli and Raheem Sterling. Rodgers added: ‘We didn’t deserve to lose, but we need to be more clinical. ‘Their keeper got man of the match and that tells you everything. We created more chances against United than in the last five or six games but we are disappointed with the first and the third goal. ‘The second one was clearly offside. With the players we had we did the best we could.’ Van Gaal’s side are eight points behind Chelsea and are in third position in the Premier League after this convincing victory.

We are winning now, six matches in a row but we have to improve our style. ‘We can kill the game easily, but we must improve. Everyone is happy now - my cook is happy and my wife is happy because we beat Liverpool. ‘We have a way of playing that takes into account the qualities of the opponent and my staff are always looking for the way we can inflict pain on the opponent. Despite the comfortable victory, their sixth in a row, Louis van Gaal admitted United have to improve . VIDEO Van Gaal not concerned with title talk . ‘You need luck, but you can force the luck. That was not the case at the start of the season.’ Van Persie added: ‘The fans were absolutely brilliant from the start to the finish. They were our 12th man again. David was outstanding again. He was absolutely brilliant like he always is.’ United are dealing with another injury after Marcos Rojo pulled out on Saturday. Van Gaal refused to discuss the extent of the problem.

"Mauricio Pochettino might want to look up that old saying about houses built on sand. It might just ring a Christmas bell or two regarding a side who are reasonably capable of scoring but need some pointers on how to defend. That much was obvious here in a performance of numerous back-line errors that had to be redeemed by goals 85 minutes apart. Leading after four minutes through Harry Kane, Tottenham spent large swathes of what remained hanging on. Had Wilfried Bony made more of the space he was repeatedly afforded by Federico Fazio, this might have been a different result altogether.

As Swansea manager Garry Monk put it: ‘It would have been stopped in the second half if it was a boxing match.’ Pochettino, meanwhile, was asked if there was a Spanish phrase for ‘smash and grab’, but he didn’t understand the question. Instead he focused on the ‘positives’, which in this case meant a first win in three league games and a tribute to the team’s spirit. Certainly, there was no shortage of application from Tottenham’s players when the going got tough and that has not always been the case in this strange season.

It was a very, very important win because Swansea have very good players.’ He added: ‘In football, sometimes you deserve it and sometimes not. I think we deserved it because we scored. Sometimes in the last few games, we deserved more but didn’t score. This is football.’ Monk was not nearly so philosophical, lamenting the lack of clinical finishing up front and the errors from Angel Rangel and Jazz Richards that led to Tottenham’s two goals. He said: ‘It’s sickening. I couldn’t see that coming, to be honest. Two individual errors cost us two goals and the result. We created enough chances to score a number of goals and didn’t do it. ‘We gifted them the first and the second half it was one way until we made another mistake for the goal.In the second half they were hanging on. That is when you have to kill people. You have to be ruthless.’ Of those errors, the first came inside four minutes. The origins were questionable, a debatable foul given against Jefferson Montero on Swansea’s left from which Tottenham won a corner. Eriksen delivered the cross and Kane headed his 10th goal of the season. A fine tally, certainly, but helped generously in this instance by some flat-footed marking from Rangel, who was similarly lacking in defeat against West Ham last week. The retaliation started soon after and Pochettino ought to be concerned about the opportunities his side gave up. There’s no doubt that Bony’s movement has improved this season, but a man of his build should not find it so easy to escape detection from centre halves. At times, Fazio and Jan Vertonghen were clueless in plotting his location.

The first sign came on nine minutes when the Ivorian turned inside Fazio and drew a good save from Hugo Lloris. Bony then got away from Vertonghen to meet a superb through-ball from Montero. The striker was clean through but Ben Davies’s slide tackle was a perfect mixture of timing and technique. The left-back tussle with Danny Rose looks to have been won. Bony was twice more given space to threaten and Gylfi Sigurdsson had a shout for a penalty ignored after an apparent foul by Fazio. Monk said: ‘I asked the fourth official if their player touched the ball. I don’t think he did.’ Spurs were living dangerously and the pressure told soon after the break. Again, Fazio was guilty of allowing Bony to meet Wayne Routledge’s cross eight yards out. The initial shot came back off Fazio and Bony buried the rebound for his eighth of the campaign. From there, Sigurdsson dragged a low shot wide, while Jonjo Shelvey and Montero also went close. Kane glanced a header within a foot of the far post after an Eriksen corner, but Spurs were mostly countering rather than setting a pace. Then the sucker punch. Richards made a hash of a clearance in the 89th minute, Davies squared and Eriksen finished from the edge of the area. ‘Christian is still young — 22 years old,’ Pochettino said. ‘It is his second season in England and he is a big talent and a very key player for us.’ That much is not in doubt. It’s what happens a little further back that ought to be the concern. Bony gestures as he runs off in celebration after equalising for Swansea against Tottenham at the Liberty Stadium .

"Beyonce’s father approached Sony with plans to make a film about the early life of his daughter and her group Destiny’s Child according to the latest emails leaked from Sony. Matthew Knowles, who managed his daughter’s career until she sacked him in 2011, is also believed to have approached Universal according to the email dated December 4, 2013. ‘Matthew Knowles, Beyonce’s Father wants to make the film of Destiny’s Child and came to me first,’ wrote Screen Gems president Clint Culpepper to Sony’s Amy Pascal and a few other Sony executives. Scroll down for video . Beyonce’s father Matthew Knowles had approached Sony with plans to make a film about the early life of his daughter and her group Destiny’s Child according to the latest emails leaked from Sony . ‘He’s going to Universal next. Do we think it would be a successful film? They’re on Sony label. I’m just not sure that it’s not too soon.’ The Lifetime Network is set to air a Destiny’s Child biopic in February, but the Sony executives return very enthusiastic responses to Culpepper, reports The Daily Beast. Knowles had guided his daughter’s career since her teenage debut as lead singer of Destiny’s Child, but she took over the reins of her own career in 2011 amid allegations that he had stolen money from her. Between 1998 and 2005 the band enjoyed a run of hit singles including Independent Women, Bootylicious and Say My Name despite several lineup changes. They split in 2005 as Beyonce decided to focus on her solo career. In recent years Knowles has become better known for fathering several illegitimate children rather than his business prowess. Another musician mentioned in the latest leaked emails is Kanye West and discusses about potential pitch for a feature film featuring the rapper. News of the Destiny's Child proposal has emerged after an email sent by Screen Gems president Clint Culpepper, left, to Sony’s Amy Pascal, right, and other Sony executives was leaked . West is reportedly set to appear in the as-yet-untitled Christmas Eve film due out next year starring Seth Rogen and Joseph Gordon-Levitt. In an email dated August 7, 2014, producer James Weaver wrote: ‘We’ll have an XMAS tease for 2015. We have a specific idea to attach to THE INTERVIEW that will crush. Seth, Joe, and [Anthony] Mackie reenacting the scene from BIG on the floor piano at FAO Schwartz with KANYE WEST. It’s f***ing awesome.’ The latest leaks also reveal that Sony is looking into rebooting its Spiderman franchise yet again. Sony has plans for a Spider-Man three cameo in the third Captain America film, Captain America: Civil War, which is scheduled to be released in May 2016. Exposed: The hackers have promised that the latest round of leaks will be more damaging than previously ones. Pictured is Sony Corporation CEO Kazuo Hirai . Other emails include discusses about plans for a 'female spidey movie,' and an Avengers-like superhero extravaganza incorporating characters from different upcoming Spider-Man-related projects. The Guardians of Peace group, which has disclosed financial information and embarrassing private correspondence from the highest echelons of the entertainment giant, heralded the seventh 'gift' in a message on a file-sharing site. The hackers wrote: 'We are preparing for you a Christmas gift. The gift will be larger quantities of data. And it will be more interesting. 'The gift will surely give you much more pleasure and put Sony Pictures into the worst state.' According to technology site Re/code, the new information will deal with a 2006 acquisition of a video site called Grouper, later renamed Crackle. Pressure: Emails showed Seth Rogen, left, was pressured to change scenes showing the death of North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un (right) Sony has been battered by the disclosures, which include racist emails mocking President Obama, and insults directed at Will Smith's children. Most of the exchanges involve Sony Pictures chairman Amy Pascal, who is now said to be fighting to keep her high-powered job. Other disclosures included accusations that Leonardo DiCaprio is 'despicable' for pulling out of a film, and a description of Angelina Jolie as a 'minimally talented spoiled brat'. Further disclosures have centered on the upcoming release of The Interview, a film depicting the assassination of North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un. Exchanges reveal pressure was applied to director and star Seth Rogen to change the death scene. Some have claimed that the hackers are linked to the North Korean regime. Another repercussion of the hack has been the alleged collapse of Sony's financial systems. According to reports Friday, the company is now unable to process transactions, which has led to external companies canceling film shoots.","Latest leaks reveal that Matthew Knowles approached Sony about making a movie about Destiny's Child .

"Ronald Koeman emerged from a thorough drenching at Turf Moor and a fourth straight defeat sounding every bit like a man who is starting to lose patience with his players. After outplaying Manchester United at home on Monday night and losing, Saints were the better team again here. But Tom Heaton’s brilliant penalty save from Dusan Tadic proved to be the turning point and Ashley Barnes snatched the winner 17 minutes from time to lift Burnley clear of the relegation zone. Worse still for Koeman, the goal came from a Southampton throw-in close to their own penalty box and at a point in the game when they were dominant. Ashley Barnes bundled the ball home from close range to give Burnley a valuable win against Southampton .

However, when he tried to play the ball down the line, it was charged down by Danny Ings. The ball ran loose for Barnes, whose shot looked unlikely to trouble Fraser Forster until it took a deflection off Toby Alderweireld and rolled inside the England goalkeeper’s near post. ‘Of course I’m very disappointed,’ said a dejected Koeman. ‘It’s been the same story in the last few games. You can make football very difficult but I don’t like to do that because it’s simple. This isn’t the first time. ‘It’s about scoring from chances and more mistakes in defence. That’s why we had a row of winning games and why we didn’t win today or against United. Maybe it’s confidence now after four defeats.

Clatternburg checks to see if Heaton is alright after a heavy collision during the first half at Turf Moor . Burnley defender Michael Keane puts in a strong challenge on Southampton midfielder Jake Hasketh . Hasketh lies down in agony after feeling the full brunt of the challenge from Keane . ‘From the start of the second half to missing the penalty we played great football. We had total domination and I was waiting for the goal. 'We had chances to kill the game but then one mistake — I call it a mistake because our throw-in ends in a goal for Burnley — and that’s disappointing.’ This win made it 12 points from six games for Burnley, who looked doomed to relegation when they were still waiting for their first win a month ago. In a contest of two very contrasting styles, Sean Dyche’s team had the better of the first half but were on the back foot in torrential rain after half-time and should have gone behind when Southampton won their penalty. There was little doubt about the decision from referee Mark Clattenburg: Ryan Bertrand sold George Boyd a dummy and the Burnley forward took the defender down with his outstretched right foot. Tadic scored 11 penalties in two seasons at FC Twente before joining Southampton in the summer and this one seemed good enough, steered low inside the post with his left foot. But Heaton anticipated brilliantly and lunged full-length to turn it away with both hands. Koeman was unimpressed. ‘In my opinion it was not a good penalty,’ said the Dutchman. ‘Tadic is a specialist. Maybe it’s confidence. It was good goalkeeping but (the shot) was not very hard. It’s a bad penalty.’ Alistair Campbell is pictured ahead of Burnley's match with Southampton on Saturday .

Southampton went agonisingly close to equalising in the closing stages but Clyne fired inches wide of the post and an unmarked Victor Wanyama somehow headed over in added time. ‘You need a scratch of luck and we got that with the goal,’ said Dyche. ‘The same can’t be said for the penalty save because it was outstanding. They’re the margins and we’ve been on the wrong side of them at times. ‘Southampton have brought in quality and £60million speaks for itself.

"Pope Francis has suggested that the Vatican could support gay civil unions in the future, according to one of the church’s most senior cardinals. Cardinal Timothy Dolan said that the pontiff wants the Catholic Church to study same-sex unions, ‘rather than condemn them’. Cardinal Dolan told American television that Francis wants church leaders to 'look into it and see the reasons that have driven them.' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Pope Francis - pictured holding his weekly general audience on March 5, 2014, in Vatican City -  wants the Catholic Church to study same-sex unions rather than condemn them . Debate: Archbishop Dolan said his own view was that gay unions could 'water down' the symbolic meaning of traditional marriage . 'It wasn't as if he came out and approved them,' Dolan told NBC on Sunday.  'He said, “Rather than quickly condemn them, let's just ask the questions as to why that has appealed to certain people.”’ In an interview to mark his first year in the church’s top job, Pope Francis last week reaffirmed the Vatican’s opposition to gay marriage but indicated that some types of civil unions could be acceptable to the church. The Pope restated the church's teaching that 'marriage is between a man and a woman,' but added 'We have to look at different cases and evaluate them in their variety.' Cardinal Dolan, pictured here with Barack Obama in New York in 2012,  told American television that Pope Francis wants church leaders to 'look into same sex unions and see the reasons that have driven them' Pope Francis will make his first trip to Asia in August, visiting South Korea to participate in a Catholic youth festival, preside over a beatification ceremony for 124 Korean martyrs and bring a message of peace to the war-divided peninsula, officials said. The August 14-18 trip announced Monday by the Vatican will be Francis' second foreign visit this year after his brief visit to Jordan, Israel and the Palestinian territories in May. Francis told reporters last summer en route home from his first foreign trip to Brazil that he wanted to go to Asia because Pope Benedict XVI never managed to get to the continent, aside from a quick trip to Turkey in 2006. The visit will mark the first time in 25 years that a pope has visited the Korean peninsula. Pope John Paul II last visited in 1989 and he canonized 103 Korean martyrs during a 1984 trip. Francis last month cleared 124 other Korean martyrs for beatification and is expected to preside over the ceremony himself during the trip, South Korea's Yonhap news agency and the Vatican-affiliated missionary news agency AsiaNews reported. Yohhap quoted Bishop Peter Kang U-il, president of the Catholic Bishops' Conference of Korea, as saying the visit will also help bring peace to the peninsula. The two Koreas have been in a near-constant standoff since an armistice ended the Korean War in 1953. ‘I think his choice of the divided Korean peninsula as the destination of his first Asian trip came out of his aspiration for peace on the peninsula and the rest of the world and his hope to pray together with Asian youths,’ Kang said, according to Yonhap. Some countries justify civil unions as a way to provide the same economic and legal rights to cohabitating couples as those who are married, the Pope said in the interview with Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera. As archbishop of Buenos Aires, the then Jorge Maria Bergoglio was one of the leaders of the Catholic Church's public charge against legalising same-sex marriage in Argentina. He called the proposed legislation ‘a destructive attack on God's plan’. But behind closed doors the Argentine archbishop is said to have supported civil unions for same-sex couples. Former theology professor and gay rights activist Marcelo Marquez said: 'He told me “I'm in favour of gay rights and in any case, I also favour civil unions for homosexuals, but I believe that Argentina is not yet ready for a gay marriage law”.’ But Francis’ comments are the first time that a Pope has indicated even tentative acceptance of civil unions, according to Vatican watchers. Archbishop Dolan said his own view was that gay unions could 'water down' the symbolic meaning of traditional marriage. 'It's not something that's just a religious, sacramental concern,' Dolan said. 'It's also the building block of society and culture. So it belongs to culture. And if we water down that sacred meaning of marriage in any way, I worry that not only the church would suffer, I worry that culture and society would.' Since being elected Pope last year Francis has softened the tone coming out of Rome. He told journalists that he would not 'judge' gays and lesbians including gay priests saying, 'If a person is gay and seeks God and has good will, who am I to judge?' In recognition for the perceived change in stance Francis appeared on the cover of gay magazine The Advocate as their person of the year.","Cardinal Timothy Dolan said the pontiff wants same-sex unions studied .

"Scott Brown scored an early double as Celtic moved six points clear in the Scottish Premiership with a dominant 4-1 victory over bottom club St Mirren. Brown opened the scoring in the fourth minute and put Celtic 3-1 up inside 18 minutes after goals from Sean Kelly and James Forrest. Saints had other chances in an eventful opening spell but Celtic took complete control after Brown's second and it became a matter of how many they would score. Scott Brown (left) celebrates his opening strike against St Mirren as Celtic moved six points clear . Despite creating numerous chances they only managed one more, with Anthony Stokes claiming the glory, and there was some concern for manager Ronny Deila as John Guidetti limped off in the second half while Forrest also failed to reappear after the interval. St Mirren should have scored even earlier than Celtic but Kenny McLean took a fresh-air swipe when clean through on the edge of the box after John McGinn had nutmegged Efe Ambrose and curled a wonderful ball into his path. Brown soon made no mistake from similar range after a Stokes cross was diverted into his path by Saints defender Marc McAusland. McGinn quickly set up McLean again but the midfielder was offside as he finished from six yards, but the Paisley side levelled in the 10th minute. Sean Kelly equalised for St MIrren but James Forrest (above) restored Celtic's lead in the 15th minute . McAusland turned McLean's deep free-kick across the goalmouth and left-back Kelly hooked in off the post. Forrest had a decent long-range effort saved before he put Celtic back in front when he fired in off the post after good skill from Guidetti. Forrest then turned provider, cutting in from the right before laying off to Brown, who curled the ball round a crowd of players and inside Marc Ridgers' near post. Celtic then bombarded the Saints defence before the break, notably from a series of corners. Ridgers beat away Nir Bitton's glancing header and Guidetti's shot and Stefan Johansen missed another good opportunity before the Celtic fans were given the chance to salute former favourite Shunsuke Nakamura at half-time. Anthony Stokes (centre) caps off a dominant display for the home side with his 67th minute strike . St Mirren, led by caretaker manager Gary Teale following Tommy Craig's departure on Tuesday, looked a beaten team in the second half as Celtic cruised. Stokes had a goal disallowed for offside before curling a free-kick inches wide after Guidetti had been hurt as he battled for the ball. However the Irishman fired in off the post in the 67th minute after linking up well with Johansen, not for the first time in the game. Guidetti's replacement, Stefan Scepovic, missed a hat-trick of glorious chances to make the score even more emphatic. The Serbian twice shot wide when played clean through and then turned Emilio Izaguirre's cross off the inside of the post from close range and watched as it bounced to safety. John McGinn also fired just wide for St Mirren following a good run from Jason Naismith but the Paisley side look to be in need of an injection of confidence ahead of their meeting with fellow strugglers Motherwell on Saturday.","Scott Brown opened the scoring in the fourth minute .

"CLICK HERE TO READ MARTIN SAMUEL'S MATCH REPORT FROM OLD TRAFFORD . Towards the end of this remarkable game at Old Trafford, David de Gea managed to make a save from Mario Balotelli while looking in the opposite direction. At the other end, Brad Jones’ goalkeeping for Liverpool was characterised by one moment when he dived the wrong way and another when he fell over. Not surprisingly, Manchester United scored on both occasions. It would be wrong to say Jones – Liverpool’s reserve goalkeeper – was to blame for this defeat. He wasn’t. He didn’t have a terrible game. David De Gea (left) pulled off a number of outstanding saves during the games denying Mario Balotelli . Brad Jones was wrong-footed by Wayne Rooney for the first and then fell over for Robin van Persie's goal . Van Persie and his Manchester United's celebrate after making it 3-0 at Old Trafford to wrap up the victory . NEIL ASHTON - INSIDE TRACK: Is United los the end for some Liverpool players? PLAYER RATINGS: Raheem Sterling endures day to forget in front of goal . Nevertheless, the Australian’s afternoon was perhaps symptomatic of Liverpool’s current problems in that if something can currently go wrong then it probably will. Here at Old Trafford, Liverpool managed to lose while playing the better football. They managed to create the better chances and take none of them. As odd as it sounds, this was an afternoon that actually served to remind us that Liverpool still have some very good players. At times, Brendan Rodgers’ team played some incisive, dextrous football. In their better moments, they passed the ball well and moved intelligently. Their great rivals, on the other hand, were only sporadically fluent. At times there was very little flow to their football. Louis van Gaal’s team, however, broke with purpose on some occasions and devastatingly on others. Their goals came from rapier thrusts while Liverpool seemed to invent new ways not to score. Crucially, United did not make the mistakes in their own half that Liverpool did. Juan Mata looked to be offside but made it 2-0 to Manchester United in the first-half . Brendan Rodgers' side played better football than the hosts but were ultimately soundly beaten . This is not to denigrate United. They are still finding their way under Van Gaal. The Dutch coach’s inability to field a settled side continues to hamper progress in what United hope will one day be viewed as a pivotal season in the post-Alex Ferguson years. Afterwards, Van Gaal spoke about how easily his players gave the ball away. It is a recurring theme. The United manager, however, will not have woken this morning worried about what he can do that is new when he arrives at training today. His team have six wins from six and, despite their shortcomings, are at least moving forwards. Rodgers has no such comfort. One of a football manager’s most debilitating problems is one that refuses to go away no matter how many different ways he tries to solve it. As he admitted after the game, Rodgers’ team’s defending just will not get better. At times there is only so much a manager can do. The Brazilian midfielder Philippe Coutinho was one of Liverpool’s better players on Sunday but he trailed to track Wayne Rooney midway through the first half and United took the lead. Philippe Coutinho was branded 'lazy' after an 'unforgivable' lack of marking by Sky Sports pundit Gary Neville . Louis van Gaal's men posses the quality of winning games when not playing well this season . Speaking on TV, former Liverpool defender Jamie Carragher called Coutinho’s lack of diligence ‘unforgivable’ and ‘lazy’ and he was similarly unimpressed as Martin Skrtel failed to get close enough to Robin van Persie for United’s second goal and Dejan Lovren presented the ball straight to Rooney in the build-up to the third. For Liverpool every day is Groundhog Day. It is impossible for them to move forwards while they are chained to this uncertainty. Rodgers insists he does not need a defensive coach. If that is the case then maybe he just needs better defenders. On Sunday United were once again forced in to something new at the back. A training ground injury to Marcos Rojo saw Phil Jones rushed back while Michael Carrick dropped back to bolster a three-man defensive line that also featured the club’s best nuts and bolts defender Jonny Evans. Once again it had a look of make-do-and-mend about it but United are learning to get through. Crucially, some players are improving. Carrick was exceptional – we expect that – but Antonio Valencia and Ashley Young have become far better wing-backs than anybody would ever have imagined and it is these things, these small improvements, that, when put together, can make the difference. Michael Carrick was exceptional in defence but United had several other unsung heroes on Sunday . Antonio Valencia and Ashley Young impressed in the wing-back positions against rivals Liverpool . Liverpool have no such improvement to bolster them as they anticipate challenges ahead. Indeed, on this evidence and that of recent games, it is hard to imagine them heading to Bournemouth in the Capital One Cup on Wednesday without encountering further problems. Rodgers’ decision to select Jones in goal was peculiar. Liverpool’s number one Simon Mignolet is not really good enough but his understudy certainly is not. The 32-year-old’s first contribution was to slice a clearance up in to the air, his second to dive the wrong way as Rooney struck blow number one from the edge of the penalty area. Goalkeeping was not what killed Liverpool, though. They continue to look like a team that doesn’t really believe it can win and at the end captain Steven Gerrard looked resigned rather than crestfallen. It was an interesting image. As his contract issue rumbles on at Anfield, one wonders if he will ever be back here in Liverpool colours again.

"Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini has said he will allow Yaya Toure to play through his difficult period rather than take him out of the firing line on compassionate grounds. Pellegrini, who will be without captain Vincent Kompany at QPR on Saturday, has been talking to the troubled midfielder on a daily basis to help Toure rediscover the form that helped City win last season’s Premier League. Toure is mourning the loss of his younger brother Ibrahim to cancer and has had to put up with racial abuse on social media. He lost his head in City’s 2-1 Champions League defeat to CSKA Moscow on Wednesday and was sent off for shoving Roman Eremenko in the face. VIDEOS Scroll down to watch . Manuel Pellegrini says Yaya Toure will not be sold by Manchester City despite inconsistent displays this year . Pellegrini said Toure is considered a 'very important player' and the club has never thought of selling him . But Pellegrini says neither he nor Toure think a break is needed to recharge the player’s batteries. ‘If I thought Yaya needed to mentally rest from the pressure, he is not the player I think he is,’ said Pellegrini. ‘He has all my support. He made a mistake in the second half against CSKA but not everything that happens at Manchester City is because of one player. ‘Yaya is a very important player. He will continue to (be picked) because that is the best way. ‘I talk to him every day and know he wants to continue playing.’ Toure scored for City against CSKA Moscow in the Champions League on Wednesday . But the Ivorian midfielder later saw red as Man City slumped to a defeat that dents their European hopes . Manchester City are currently six points behind Chelsea in the Premier League title race . The City boss also dismissed reports that Toure will leave the club, despite there being no negotiations planned for a new contract. ‘Never in my mind or anyone at the club have we thought about selling Yaya. Maybe the stories come from teams that want to see us weaker,’ he said. Kompany’s absence with a calf strain picked up against CSKA means Toure could even wear the captain’s armband at Loftus Road if Pablo Zabaleta is given a rest. The injury to Kompany gives a chance to £32million summer signing Eliaquim Mangala, who has had poor reviews since becoming the Premier League’s most expensive defender. ‘He has not played so well in some games but I’m sure he will be an important player for this club,’ said Pellegrini. ‘I remember the criticism (Martin) Demichelis had, now it is the same for Mangala.’ City will be chasing their fifth league win in six games at Loftus Road — a mention of which Pellegrini, who has been criticised for tactical naivety, dropped in to avert any talk of a crisis. They sit third in the table behind Chelsea and Southampton. ‘Every club will drop points and show some weakness at some point over the course of a season,’ the Chilean coach asserted. ‘It was the same last year when we lost a few early away games and when we lost to Liverpool. In the end, finally, the title came here again.’ VIDEO Tueart mystified by Toure's slump in form .","Yaya Toure has struggled to find his best form for Man City this season .

"Munster's European Champions Cup destiny is slipping out of their hands after they were beaten 26-19 by star-studded Clermont Auvergne at Stade Marcel-Michelin. Munster had never lost the back-to-back contests of rounds three and four but Clermont became the first to do that double over the former champions following their historic 16-9 win at Thomond Park a week earlier. It means Clermont are firm automatic quarter-final qualifiers after they moved four-points clear at the top of a hugely competitive Pool 1 having collected 17 points ahead of Saracens, with Munster third on 10 points - the Irish team facing Saracens and Sale Sharks next month. Noa Nakaitaci (left) breaks away to score a try during Clermont's Champions Cup victory over Munster . Nakaitaci crosses the line as Clermont move four points clear at the top of their Pool 1 . Nakaitaci is congratulated by team-mates after scoring one of the tries of the tournament . The match was a fast and furious contest but - while Munster gave it their all - it was Clermont who had the class where it mattered most in the backs. Munster started strongly and went six points clear with two Ian Keatley penalties - and his injury-time effort earned them a losing bonus point - but Clermont produced some glorious flowing rugby to conjure up a couple of memorable tries. Wesley Fofana was one of those weaving his magic and Munster simply ran out of defenders for skipper Damien Chouly to finish off a magnificent team try. Then, just before the break, a scintillating solo effort from wing Noa Nakaitaci produced another contender for try of the tournament and Camille Lopez's conversion made it 15-6 at the break.

Munster had contested every scrap of possession with great intensity - Paul O'Connell always in the thick of things - but a yellow card for full back Felix Jones for a trip on outside half Lopez, who ended up with 11 points from the boot, left them a man short and facing an even higher mountain to climb. Clermont had the upper hand in the scrums while Munster had their best moments at the breakdown but, when it came to posing threats with the ball in hand, Lopez sending a pinpoint cross kick for Chouly to collect unopposed and cross for his second and Clermont's third. Hooker Duncan Casey finally found the way to the Clermont line late on and Keatley converted but Clermont had already done the damage.","Clermont Auvergne were too strong for Munster in Champions Cup clash .

"David Cameron was accused of complacency over the Iraq crisis last night as he left Downing Street to resume his beach holiday. The Prime Minister headed for Cornwall straight after breakfast yesterday having spent only 19 hours in London. He had interrupted his family vacation following the brutal murder of US hostage James Foley by a British Jihadist fighting with Islamic State. Scroll down for video . David Cameron emerges from a car as he returned to Cornwall after crisis meetings in London . Mr Cameron and his wife Samantha pictured leaving Lewis's Deli and Coffee Shop in Cornwall today . Mr Cameron  cut short his holiday in Cornwall to hold a meeting on the situation in Iraq and Syria with Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond . As Mr . Cameron was pictured by a holidaymaker visiting a cafe and deli in Rock . with wife Samantha, No. 10 insisted he would continue to receive regular . briefings on the crisis. But critics accused the Prime Minister of a . dereliction of duty – and questioned why he has refused to recall . Parliament to debate Mr Foley’s murder and the threat to security posed . by jihadis who return to the UK. In . the US, President Obama faced similar criticism after he was pictured . smiling on the golf course within minutes of giving a speech condemning . the murder. Labour . MP Ann Clwyd, former British human rights envoy to Iraq, said of Mr . Cameron: ‘I just find it extraordinary that he has gone off on holiday . again after a few hours back in London – it is just not good enough. If . he is serious about the threat to Britain, as he says he is and as he . ought to be, then he should not be pushing off on holiday. He should be . recalling MPs to Parliament so that we can discuss the situation and . debate our response.

That is . really frightening for some people and they expect to see the Prime . Minister taking charge.’ John Woodcock, a Labour member of the Commons defence committee, said Mr Cameron’s decision sent out the wrong signal. ‘With . the rise of IS extremists we are probably facing the biggest threat to . our values and the country’s security since 9/11,’ he said. ‘The . combination of the PM not being at his desk and his refusal to bring MPs . back to the Commons sends a terribly complacent signal at a time when . we should be showing the world we will never tolerate these hideous . incidents and these awful people.

"Patrice Evra scored his first goal in Serie A but Juventus were held 1-1 at home by Champions League hopefuls Sampdoria on Sunday, ending the Turin club's home winning streak of 25 matches. Evra, the former Manchester United left-back, put Juventus ahead with a header following a corner 12 minutes in. Allowed time to line up a shot from the edge of the area, Sampdoria substitute Manolo Gabbiadini equalized in the 51st by shooting inside the far post for his sixth goal of the season.

Sampdoria celebrate in front of their jubilant fans after levelling the scores at the Juventus Stadium . It was Juve's last home match of 2014, so ending the winning streak at the Juventus Stadium was especially bitter so close to completing a perfect year. The last time Juve dropped points at home in the Italian league was a 1-1 draw with Cagliari in May 2013, while the last loss was a 2-1 defeat to Sampdoria in January 2013. 'They're really strong here. They're also tough on the road but here they have another gear,' Gabbiadini said. 'We struggled in the first half, which was expected, but we managed to equalise.' After the lunchtime fixture, three-time defending champions Juventus moved four points ahead of second-place Roma. Juventus also drew their previous match, 0-0 at Fiorentina. 'It's too bad, because we created a ton of chances in the first half and we didn't take advantage of them all,' said Juve's coach Massimiliano Allegri. Carlos Tevez of Juventus tries to pick out a pass during the Serie A match in Turin . Juve midfielder Paul Pogba takes on the Sampdoria defence in Sunday's clash . Alvaro Morata cuts a dejected figure after Juventus concede to Sampdoria in the second-half . Sampdoria, who stretched their unbeaten streak to six matches, moved level third on points with Genoa and Lazio in the race for the final Champions League berth. Perhaps keeping in mind that the Italian Super Cup in Doha, Qatar is coming up on December 22, Allegri rested midfield maestro Andrea Pirlo. Juventus was also without the suspended defender Giorgio Chiellini. Despite the early kick-off, Juventus were sharp from the start with Alvaro Morata and Roberto Pereyra threatening in the opening 10 minutes. Despite his comparatively small stature at 5ft 9in, the 33-year-old Evra leaped to meet a corner from Claudio Marchisio at the edge of the box and score an impressive goal. Pogba tries to get clear of Gabbiadini, who attempts to drag him back . Angelo Ogbonna is challenged by Sampdoria's Stefano Chuka Okaka . Evra, who joined Juventus on a two-year contract in July, only scored seven goals in 273 Premier League matches with United. Midway through the first half, France midfielder Paul Pogba nearly made it 2-0 after expertly controlling a 60-yard pass from Leonardo Bonucci but couldn't find the target. Two minutes after the break, Pereyra had a good look but his shot from a tight angle went high. Sampdoria coach Sinisa Mihajlovic replaced Nenad Krsticic with Gabbiadini to start the half and the move paid off when he shot past outstretched Gianluigi Buffon to draw the visitors level. Buffon then preserved the draw by tipping a shot wide from Gabbiadini that had deflected off the back of defender Angelo Ogbonna.","Juventus and Sampdoria drew 1-1 in Turin on Sunday afternoon .

"Chuck O’Rear was driving to visit his girlfriend when he was struck by the beauty of the rolling vineyards. Many people would have carried on without bothering to stop and take a photograph. But the former National Geographic magazine photographer was so entranced by the green of the grass and the white clouds in the perfectly blue California sky that he pulled over and got out his camera. Never for a moment did he think the shot would become the most viewed image on the planet. Scene grab: The area shot by Chuck O'Rear in Sonoma, Napa, North California, for his 'Bliss' photo used by Microsoft Windows XP . Familiar view: The Windows XP default background image recognisable to PC users . When it comes to famous photographs, a computer desktop image is unlikely to be the first thought on most people’s minds. But more than a billion people around the world have seen Mr O’Rear’s photo of the countryside near his Napa Valley home. Most of them don’t even realise they have been looking at it. For it was chosen by Microsoft engineers as the desktop image for their Windows XP background. Although the 69-year-old photographer . signed a confidentiality agreement so he can’t say how much he got paid . – it is reportedly the second most expensive photo licence ever purchased. ‘I . drove the same route between Napa and San Francisco a couple of times a . week in 2002 or 2003 but this was January when the grass is the most . brilliant green here so I jumped out and took a couple of shots and then . carried on my way,’ said Mr O’Rear. Mr O'Rear's shot purchased for an undisclosed sun by Microsoft . He didn’t give much more thought to the picture after picking up girlfriend Daphne Larkin, who he married shortly after. It was only when he got a call from his agent with the Corbis photo archive telling him that Microsoft wanted the original of the picture that he discovered he’d hit the jackpot. ‘I had no idea when I took the photograph that anything like that could happen. It is probably the most recognized photo on the planet. If you took it to some village in Bangladesh the might recognise it or you could stop somebody walking down the street in China and they may know what it is,’ he added. Mr O’Rear, who began his career with the Kansas City Star and the Los Angeles Times, worked for 25 years for the National Geographic and now specialises in photographing winemaking in Napa and around the world. But unlike many PC users, he doesn’t get to see his XP photo every day – because he uses a Mac.

"A Parkinson's sufferer has won a six figure pay-out against a drug giant after his medication turned him into a 'gay sex and gambling addict'. Didier Jambart had been a well respected man, an upstanding member of the community in Nantes, western France, and a loving father and husband. But within two years of taking the drug Requip he was so addicted to both his vices he sold his children's toys to raise money and advertised himself on the internet for sex. He has now been given £160,000 in damages after a court in Rennes, France, upheld his claims. With his wife Christine beside him , Mr Jambart, 52, cries as judges uphold his claim that his life had become 'hell' after he started taking a drug to help his Parkinson's . The court heard Requip, a drug made by GlaxoSmithKline,  had turned Mr Jambart into a 'gay sex and gambling addict' The ground-breaking ruling was made yesterday by the appeal court, which awarded the damages to Mr Jambart from GlaxoSmithKline, the British pharmaceuticals giant. With his wife Christine beside him, Mr Jambart, 52, broke down in tears as judges upheld his claim that his life had become 'hell' after he started taking Requip, a drug made by GSK. He told reporters 'this is a great day' after the court threw out the firm's appeal against an earlier ruling to award him 117,000 euros. The court increased the level of damages to 197,468.83 euros after finding that there was 'serious, precise and corroborated' evidence to blame his transformation on Requip. The father, from Nantes, France, said the drug had turned his life into hell after he sold his children's toys and advertised himself for sex on the internet after taking the drug . Mr Jambart said: 'It's been a seven-year battle with our limited means for recognition of the fact that GSK lied to us and shattered our lives.' He added: 'I am happy that justice has been done. I am happy for my wife and my children. I am at last going to be able to sleep at night and profit from life. ' But he added that the money he was awarded was not like winning the lottery, and said: 'This will never replace the years of pain.' The court heard that Mr Jambart  began taking Requip for Parkinson's disease in 2003. The formerly well respected bank manager, local councillor and a father of two from Nantes in western France, had tried to commit suicide eight times after he turned into a sex-crazed gambling addict. He told the court that he had emptied his bank account, sold his children's toys and stolen money from work colleagues, friends and neighbours. In total he gambled away a total of 82,000 euros, mostly placing internet bets on horse races, and engaged in a 'frantic search for gay sex'. He began exhibiting himself on internet websites and arranging encounters, one of which resulted in him being raped. He said his family had not understood what was going on at first. But his behaviour returned to normal when he stumbled upon a website that made the link between Requip and addictions in 2005, and stopped taking the drug. He said : 'My life was hell. It still is because you cannot forget a catastrophe like that.' Mr Jambart outside the  courthouse in Rennes, western France, where he was awarded £160,000 in damages . The court heard that warnings about Requip's side-effects had been made public in 2006. Mr Jambart said that GSK should have informed patients earlier. He conceded that Requip was a 'good medicine' and offered undeniable solutions to people with Parkinson's disease. But he said the rules of the game 'must be transparent'. During the trial, GlaxoSmithKline had said it had 'serious doubts' that Mr Jambart had developed his addictions after taking the drug. Requip (ropinirole) is a dopamine agonist, used to treat patients with the chronic and progressive neurodegenerative condition Parkinson’s disease, for which, there are only a small number of treatments available. It directly stimulates dopamine receptors in the brain and acts as a replacement for dopamine which is deficient in certain parts of the brain in patients with Parkinson’s disease. Pathological gambling and increased libido and hypersexuality have been reported in patients treated with dopamine medicines. These reports are uncommon, when compared to the number of people treated with these medicines. Prescribing and patient information for Requip provides information on compulsive behaviours. It’s important that patients talk to their doctor before deciding to stop or start taking any medicine. Anyone receiving treatment with a dopamine agonist, or caring for someone receiving this treatment, who notices unusual behaviours, such as new or increased gambling urges, increased sexual urges or other intense urges should talk to their doctor.","Didier Jambart, of Nantes, France, was an upstanding member of the community before he started taking Requip .

"A courageous young girl who was told she would never walk again after being diagnosed with leukaemia at the age of two is set to dance in her first ballet exam. Olivia Careless, now seven, promised her mother she would learn to dance - even after discovering the harsh chemotherapy she was undergoing has seriously damaged her leg bones. Despite her devastated parents fearing the worst - a determined Olivia battled and beat the illness and was able to keep to her word by joining a ballet school. Courageous: Olivia Careless, who was diagnosed with leukaemia at the age of two, fulfilled her promise to her mother by learning to dance despite doctors saying she may never walk again . Her mother Sarah, 34, who lives in Hull, said: ‘We are so incredibly proud of Olivia. When I watch her dancing it brings tears to my eyes. ‘She never forget her promise to me as she lay in her hospital bed that she would learn to dance. I never thought it would be possible as her legs bones had been so damaged by the treatment. ‘But she has pushed herself to get better and she was so determined to learn to dance. ‘Now that she is studying for her first ever ballet exam I’m so proud. It’s something I never thought I’d see.’ Olivia, now seven, was diagnosed with leukaemia in July 2009, after being told by doctors there was nothing wrong with her - despite numerous trips to hospital and her GP over the previous six months. Miss Careless added: ‘She had started being unwell the Christmas before. I took her in and out of hospital as she kept getting rashes. On Christmas Day I took her to hospital and they told me she had mumps. Battle: As a result of her aggressive chemotherapy treatment, Olivia developed osteoarthritis and her bones became so weak that her leg broke when her mother was changing her nappy . Proud: Olivia's mother Sarah (pictured) said: 'When I watch her dancing it brings tears to my eyes' ‘Then another time they gave her steroids as they thought she’d had an allergic reaction as her lips had swollen with a rash. ‘But nothing seemed to help her get better. She was so exhausted all the time. Two year olds should have so much energy, but she was lethargic constantly.’ Then one day after discovering bruises all over Olivia's body, Miss Careless took her to the GP and he referred her straight to hospital for blood tests. It was then that doctors discovered she was suffering from Acute Myeloid Leukaemia. They told her parents that had they left her the symptoms unchecked for a couple more days then Olivia would have died. Miss Careless said: ‘Our whole world came crashing down around us. All these months that she’d been unwell and she actually had cancer. Determined: Despite the devastating effects of her illness and treatment, Olivia pushed herself towards fulfilling her dream of learning to dance . 'It was terrifying. She was only two years old, and yet we were being told she had cancer. ‘I’m just thankful that it was diagnosed that day, as had we left it a couple more days she may not have survived.’ Olivia had to have immediate chemotherapy treatment. She lost her hair and suffered from severe high temperatures. Miss Careless adds: ‘It was awful to watch her go through the treatment and feel helpless to do anything to help her. Miss Careless said: ‘The doctors told us that her bones were so frail that she may never walk again' 'She was in so much pain, the doctors had to pump her full of morphine. She had abcesses on her liver, spleen and stomach and she lost so much weight.’ In March 2010 Olivia started her second course of chemotherapy treatment and three months later her leg bones were so frail that when her mother was changing her nappy, her leg broke. Doctors diagnosed the condition as osteoarthritis and said it was a result of the aggressive chemotherapy treatment. Miss Careless said: ‘It broke my heart to see her lying there with her plaster casts on her legs. The doctors told us that her bones were so frail that she may never walk again.’ She started on treatment to try and strengthen her legs in summer 2011 and she also had physiotherapy too. Miss Careless said: ‘It was agony for her trying to learn to walk. But there was one thing she wanted to do. When she said to me ""mummy I want to dance when I’m better,"" it broke my heart. I never thought it would be possible.’ Olivia took her first steps in summer 2011 and since then she has come on in leaps and bounds. She finished her treatment in December 2012 and now she is in remission from her cancer. Miss Careless said: ‘We are thrilled that the treatment has worked and she has beaten the cancer.’ And in July Olivia fulfilled her promise to her mother - by joining a dancing school. She has now just started training for her first ballet exam. Miss Careless said: ‘She absolutely loves her dancing and it was very emotional when she went for the first time. ‘She pushes herself so much, and never gives up. She finds it tiring sometimes but she never complains. She’s our little hero. ‘When she was lying there with her plaster casts on her legs, I never thought dancing would be possible for her. So to see her now in her ballet shoes is an amazing sight.’ Leukaemia is the most common form of blood cancer in children. The condition affects the body's white blood cells, which help fight infection. Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALA) and acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) are forms of cancer which affect blood-producing cells in the bone marrow. When a child has leukaemia, control of blood cell production breaks down. The bone marrow - the soft tissue in the middle of our bones where all our blood cells are made - makes lots of abnormal white blood, or leukaemia cells. These never mature into proper white blood cells, vital to a healthy immune system, and so children with leukaemia are at more risk of infection. The cure rate for children with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) is now around 65 per cent.","Olivia Careless, of Hull, diagnosed with Acute Myeloid Leukaemia in 2009 .

"Jermain Defoe says he can’t wait to start scoring for goals for Sunderland as a return to the Barclays Premier League edges closer. Defoe was in the North East on Wednesday and is due to undergo a medical in the next 24 hours ahead of his move to the Stadium of Light. Defoe only joined MLS side Toronto during the summer, but, despite having scored 11 goals in 16 league appearances after signing a four-year deal, he has not settled and has been courted by a series of Premier League clubs. Jermain Defoe (left) is poised to sign for Sunderland from Major League Soccer side Toronto . Sunderland boss Gus Poyet won the race to sign the 32-year old striker who he hopes will fire the Black Cats clear of relegation. Defoe told The Mirror: ‘I felt so sharp. All that hard work has paid off. I can’t wait to start scoring goals for Sunderland. ‘Everybody knows how much I love English football and I still feel that I have a lot to offer. ‘People might look at my age, but I have always looked after myself and I hope I can show that with my performances.’ The Londoner, who worked briefly with Sunderland boss Poyet during his time at Tottenham, has scored goals throughout his club career and has 19 in 55 appearances for England. Gus Poyet (left) worked with Defoe (centre) at Tottenham and is good friends with the striker . He has netted 123 Premier League goals for three different clubs during his career in English top-flight football. Sunderland are 16th in the Premier League, just one point above the relegation zone, and Poyet will hope that Defoe will hit the ground running and start scoring immediately and help the Black Cats climb the table. Defoe has an excellent record of starting quickly and has scored on his debut for every club he has played for. Having started his youth career at Charlton Athletic, Defoe was snapped up by West Ham United at the age of just 16 before being loaned out to south coast side Bournemouth for one season, where he netted 19 times in 31 appearances. Defoe (right) has scored 11 goals in 16 league appearances for Toronto FC since joining the club . Upon his return to Upton Park, Defoe eventually broke into the Hammers side during the 2001-02 season - scoring 14 goals in 31 games. His time at West Ham was extremely successful, with the striker returning 41 goals in all competitions before moving to Tottenham in 2004 for £6million. During his first spell at White Hart Lane between 2004 and 2008, Defoe netted 61 goals in 170 appearances. He then moved to Portsmouth, where he managed 17 goals in 36 matches before returning to Spurs in 2009. A further 76 goals followed for Tottenham before his move to the MLS last year - and Defoe will be looking to add to that tally at the Stadium of Light. Defoe will undergo a medical at Sunderland as he closes in on a move to the Black Cats .","Jermain Defoe set to sign two-and-half year deal with Sunderland .

"Ringleader: Jordan Horner, known as Jamal Uddin, pictured arriving at court today where he was one of three men given Asbos banning them from promoting Sharia law for five years . Three religious vigilantes who terrorised innocent members of the public as the self-styled ‘Muslim Patrol’ have been banned from promoting Sharia Law in Britain. Jordan Horner, 20, Royal Barnes, 23, and Ricardo MacFarlane, 26, were jailed for a total of two years and ten months for touring East London harassing people they deemed to be ‘non-believers’. The three men were today also slapped with a five-year Asbo banning them from distributing material about Sharia Law to the public, or even meeting each other. The trio are also banned from associating with controversial preacher Anjem Choudary. Judge Timothy Pontius admitted the order was ‘drastic’ but added: ‘With the public interest in mind and the safety of individual members of the public in particular, it seems to me essential that these orders should be granted to run for that period of time.’ The leader of the gang, white Muslim convert Horner, who has declared he wants Sharia law in the UK, attacked people drinking in the street and demanded: ‘Remove yourselves now. Muslim Patrol.’ Barnes is a pal of Lee Rigby murderer Michael Adebolajo, and last week admitted making a string of sickening videos celebrating the deadly attack on the soldier in Woolwich. The order comes in the wake of their convictions for the Muslim Patrol attacks carried out in January last year. Prosecutor Kate Wilkinson said: ‘The order is designed to act as a much more effective and long-lasting way of making sure the streets of London are protected.’ Of Horner, she said: ‘This is a man with incredibly deep-rooted manifest beliefs with respect of this particular cause. ‘At every opportunity, he appears to manifest this in an unwelcome manner in terms of members of the public.’ She added: ‘They are affiliated with ALM, also known as Muslims Against Crusades, led by Anjem Choudary, underpinning rallies to introduce Sharia Law which they all manifestly participate in.’ Under the Asbo, the three men are . banned from approaching people in public to promote Sharia Law, or . distributing leaflets for their cause even if they are outside a mosque. They are all banned from being meeting each other, as well as Mr Choudary and Dean Le Page, another leading ALM member. Horner . is additionally banned from having a loud hailer and going to an . educational establishment unless he is a student or a relative of a . student. Barnes is also banned from distributing videos promoting Sharia Law. 'Muslim Patrol': Royal Barnes, left, and Ricardo McFarlane, right, who toured the streets with Horner harassing people they judged to be breaking strict Islamic codes, were also given the same order . The religious vigilante group’s activities were exposed in YouTube where they denigrated women as ‘slags’ and used a megaphone to scream ‘kill the non-believers’ at innocent bystanders. Two victims, Joshua Bilton and Anna Reddiford, were told to stop holding hands by Horner and Barnes as they walked down the street in Bethnal Green, East London. Horner yelled through a megaphone: ‘Let go of each other’s hands. This is a Muslim area!’ In a second incident, on January 6 last year Horner and MacFarlane attacked a group of men drinking in the streets of Shoreditch, east London. They screamed ‘kill the non-believers’ as Horner punched James Forward in the jaw and knocked out Patrick Kavanagh with a sucker punch to the head. A week later on January 13 Horner and Barnes confronted another couple, Clare Coyle and Robert Gray, walking in the street in Stepney, east London. The 23 year-old accused Miss Coyle of dressing inappropriately in a Muslim area and that she would be punished in ‘hell fire’. Horner then started filming the event on his mobile phone and branded Clare Coyle a ‘slag’, to which she countered: ‘This is Great Britain. I can dress how I wish.’ In the video, which was later uploaded on to YouTube, the group can be heard shouting: ‘You need to control this area and forbid people from exposing themselves outside the mosque. ‘Remove yourselves now. Muslim Patrol. Move away from the mosque. Don’t come back. We don’t respect those who disrespect God.’ The video also includes footage of an injured cyclist after an accident later the same morning. A voice can be heard claiming the accident was a result of people drinking on a Saturday night, adding: ‘We call you to embrace Islam, become Muslim.’ Preacher of hate: The trio are also banned from associating with controversial cleric Anjem Choudary . Choudary today insisted that Horner, McFarlane and Barnes were 'fine, upstanding members of the community' and called the order banning them from speaking to him 'unjust'. 'I have not been convicted of any crimes, even though I do not believe in the law of this land,' he said. 'I am very proud of these people who study with me. I knew them all. They used to attend my lectures. They are fine, upstanding members of the community, of very good character. 'They just wanted to speak out about the evils of alcohol, prostitution, gambling and drugs and support Sharia law. 'The oppressors are being allowed to reign which is why we are suffering these floods. It is divine punishment from God. The government and judges are trying to curtail my influence.' In December last year, Judge Rebecca Poulet QC jailed Horner for 68 weeks, MacFarlane for 12 months, and Barnes for 24 weeks. She told them: ‘One of the many good things about living in Great Britain is the tolerance and respect members of the public generally show to one another’s religious beliefs, his dress or his chosen way of life. ‘When on occasions a person shows their intolerance of another individual whether by aggression or violence and in such a way as to cause real fear to the individual then the law can be invoked to protect that individual. ‘This law would protect you if someone treated you in this way. It is the very same law that now brings you before this court for your conduct. ‘My understanding is that Islam is a peaceful religion and this conduct was unfortunately anything but. ‘You were acting together and very late at night and that conduct in particular frightens people and it frightened them with your aggression.’ Despite receiving the longest sentence of the three, Horner, who has changed his name to Jamal Uddin, has already been released because of time spent in custody waiting for sentencing. The court heard at sentencing that he has a wife and two young children, and has turned his back on drugs due to his ‘religious calling’. Barnes is facing up to six-and-a-half years in prison for making the videos about Lee Rigby, including one where he laughed hysterically while driving past the scene of the murder. The Asbo will take effect from today even though he is likely to remain prison for at least two years. Horner, of Walthamstow, east London, pleaded guilty to two charges of assault and two charges of using threatening words and behaviour. He was also jailed for six weeks in July last year for beating up a photographer and causing £3,000 of damage to a car in an attack in Walthamstow, east London. McFarlane, also of Walthamstow, east London, whose real name is Ricardo Langaigne pleaded guilty to affray, and has previous convictions for criminal damage for painting over advertisements of women in the street. Barnes, of Hackney, east London, admitted two counts of using threatening words and behaviour, and has previous convictions for theft and handling stolen goods prior his conversion to Islam and also for using threatening words and behaviour on April 2012.","Trio were jailed in December for harassing 'non-believers' in East London .

"'Madame': Carmen Fluker, 42, was arrested last month after a raid on her Ferguson, Missouri, bungalow where police say they discovered a stripper poll, a fully stocked bar and a VIP room . A one-time aspiring singer from Missouri has been accused of running a brothel and strip club out of her suburban home - with her own teenage son acting as a bartender. Carmen Fluker, 42, was arrested last month after a raid on her Ferguson bungalow where police say they discovered a stripper poll, a fully stocked bar and a VIP room. Officers who descended on Fluker's humble brick house in the 400 block of Warfield Avenue seized alcohol, condoms and cash. Police say they also found a teenage girl working as a dancer. The operation resulted in Fluker being indicted last week on a single felony count of promoting prostitution between May 2011 and April 2014. The 42-year-old woman, who also goes by the monickers Carmen Lacy, Carmen Simmons, Luscious and her former stage name, Araye, told St Louis Post-Dispatch Tuesday that she had been 'set up.' According to a search warrant, police got a tip in March saying that Mrs Fluker was hosting alcohol- and drug-fueled parties with strippers every night at her home where her son's room was allegedly being used for lap dances and sex. The informant told police that whenever Fluker was planning an event, she would send messages inviting prospective customers. The unnamed tipster paid two visits to Flukers' alleged sex den and recorder the goings on inside on a hidden video camera. The April arrest was was not Fluker's first run-in with the law. In 2011, her previous residence in Bel-Ridge was raided by police. Detective Michael Slaughter wrote in a warrant at the time that the woman and her then-husband were running the Yes We Can Social Club hosting nude dancers and alcohol. Scroll down for video . Den of sin: Police acting on a tip from an informant raided Fluker's brick home on Warfield Avenue, where they found naked women and her teenage son manning the bar . On her Twitter page, which has been dormant since last June, Fluker would promote her establishment, writing about drink specials, 'Bad Girlz live entertainers,' and even exchanging a few messages with rapper Nicki Minaj. Before the 2011 raid on Fluker's home, two informants attended one of her soirees and reported seeing naked women and a 10-year-old boy, presumably the suspected madame’s son, cooking food and manning the bar. In August of that year, police officers arrested 30 people in Fluker's home, but neither she nor her husband was charged. Speaking to Fox2Now after her 2011 arrest, Fluker claimed that she was having a bachelorette party when officers barged in with their guns drawn, but found no evidence of prostitution or drug use. The woman also contended that Yes We Can Social Club was an entertainment charity she had started in January 2011 to help needy families. On Monday, the 42-year-old woman said in court that she was unemployed and living off food stamps and disability payments. An Internet search has revealed that back in 2008, Fluker was trying to build a career as a singer, performing under the name Araye in honor of her late daughter. In a biography posted on the site Showcase Your Music, Fluker-Araye wrote of herself that she has 'an energetically powerful voice' and ‘a relentless determinations [sic] to succeed as an International entertainer.' According Araye's profile, she began performing live with her father's band at age 12, singing Aretha Franklin and Gladys Knight classics. The self-described 'multi-talented songstress' went on to release a CD called 'My Life' before getting an associate degree in social work. If convicted, Fluker could face up to five years in prison and a $250,000 fine.","Carmen 'Luscious' Fluker, 42, charged with promoting prostitution between 2011 and 2014 .

Not only did she carry the same faulty BRCA1 gene that prompted her to undergo a double mastectomy, but the 31-year-old has also proved she has the same star pulling power of the Hollywood A-lister. The mother-of-three and founder of the Pink Hope charity has signed on a number of high profile Australians including Victoria's Secret Model Jess  Hart and sister Ashley, the Prime Minister's wife Margie Abbott and the daughter of the country's richest woman Bianca Rinehart for her charity campaign. The charity's latest project, Bright Pink Lipstick Day, is a social media campaign that encourages more people to discuss their hereditary health. 'We're very fortunate to have these women.

'I know there's hundreds or thousands of people at risk of hereditary cancer. Bright Pink Lipstick Day encourages people to make a promise to kiss and tell.' Ms Barter was 22 when she found out she carried the faulty BRCA1 gene.

"A terminally-ill girl with alopecia has had her dreams come true after strangers stumped up hundreds of pounds to buy her a new wig. Generous donations flooded in after it was revealed Ashanti Smith, from Burgess Hill, Sussex, was desperate to have long flowing hair like her school friends. The news touched people's hearts and they rallied to raise the money needed for a human hair wig. Scroll down for video . Dream come true: Generous donations flooded in after it was revealed that 11-year-old Ashanti Smith,  who suffers from rare ageing disease, was desperate to have long flowing hair like her school friends. The youngster was treated to a pampering day where she chose a wig and had it styled at a top salon . The 11-year-old - who suffers from rare ageing disease Hutchinson Gilford Progeria and is not expected to live past the age of 15 - could not hide her delight as she had her glossy new blonde locks styled at a top hairdressers. The youngster visited the Brighton branch of Trevor Sorbie with her mother  Phoebe and her sister Minnie. Trevor himself helped Ashanti choose a wig from Trendo before pampering the schoolgirl at his salon. The three women also enjoyed a posh meal at Donatello Italian restaurant beforehand. The day out came as a result of The Argus Appeal - a charitable arm of The Argus newspaper - that raised the funds for the schoolgirl. Speaking to the paper about their day out, her mother Phoebe said: 'Ashanti was so excited about her new wig that she didn’t go to sleep for ages. 'She loves doing these girly things. It is so nice because we can actually do something together.' Helping hand: Trevor Sobrie, a top celebrity hairdresser,  helped Ashanti choose a wig from Trendo before pampering the schoolgirl at his salon . Girly day out: The 11-year-old  could not hide her delight as she had her glossy new blonde locks styled at the  hairdressers . The day out comes two months after Ashanti was forced to remove a pink wig she wore to school as the school claimed it might encourage others to dye their hair. The pupil at Oakmeeds Community College, West Sussex, was told to take the wig off by a teacher because it was 'not cold in the school' and she felt so humiliated that she didn't want to return. Her mother Phoebe said at the time: 'She was devastated when they told her to take it off. Her little heart was broken. It's disgusting. It is bright but she should have the right to wear whatever colour hair she wants.' 'She was so proud of her hair but this has put her on a downer. 'When I took her into school three teachers by the office said she looked glamorous and beautiful and said how lovely her wig was. 'But as soon as I turned my back they told her to remove it. It was so embarrassing for her. 'It's a pink wig, come on, other children would have understood. I have only got a few years left with her so we want her to live it to the full.' Girls day out: Speaking about their day out, her mother Phoebe said: 'Ashanti was so excited about her new wig that she didn't go to sleep for ages' Ashanti's rare condition, Hutchinson Gilford Progeria, causes symptoms including stunted growth, hair loss, weight loss, wrinkled skin, stiff joints, and heart disease. The pink wig was donated by friends as Ashanti's family struggles to afford human hair wigs. In June this year it emerged that Ashanti's father stole £3,500 of charity money that was intended for her to go swimming with dolphins. She was given the donation by Sussex British Motorcycle Owners Club (SBMOC) in 2010 so she could go for a once-in-a-lifetime trip to America. But her father Albi Elliott, 44, hid the money from the rest of the family and within two months had spent it - on trips to Tesco. Blasting his actions as 'callous and despicably devious', the judge at Chichester Crown Court jailed Elliott for three years.

"A former CIA director said that the U.S. is the only country that could carry out a sustained attack against Iran's nuclear facilities in an effort to dissuade any such action by Israel. Michael Hayden, who was the director of the Central Intelligence Agency until 2009, granted an interview with Israel's oldest daily newspaper saying that issues regarding the location of the weapons, the stockpile of the attacker, and the collection of sufficient planning would all cause problems if Israel were to attack and not America. 'I do not underestimate the Israeli talent, but geometry and physics tell us that Iran's nuclear program would pose a difficult challenge to any military,' Mr Hayden told Haaretz. Dissuasion: Former CIA director Michael Hayden spoke to an Israeli newspaper telling them a list of reasons why America would strike Iran more efficiently than Iran . He explained that because any thorough attack on Iran would not be a one-time event and would require repeated efforts, the United States would be better equipped because 'Israel's resources are more limited' than America's. For decades, the relationship between the Islamic Republic of Iran and the Jewish state of Israel has been contentious but more extreme rhetoric by Iranian leaders escalated the balance to a worrying tipping point. As United Nations sanctions have done little to prevent Iran from continuing their nuclear weapons development, Israel continues to feel pressure to pre-emptively strike, but Mr Hayden was quick to push for patience, giving several reasons as justification. 'There is no absolute certainty that all targets are known,' he said of the various nuclear development sites in Iran. Dangerous: Tensions have continued to grow over Iran's nuclear capability, and president Mahmoud Ahmandinejad (center) was see touring the facilities in 2008 . Locations: Hayden said one of the problems with any potential strike would be that it will be difficult to find out where all of Iran's facilities- like this one in Bushehr- are located . 'They will have to be revisited - which only the U.S. Air Force would be able to do - and the operation will only set the Iranians back some time and actually push them to do that which it is supposed to prevent, getting nuclear weapons . 'While it is probably true that the so-called ""window"" regarding effective action is closing, there is still some time, as real decisions are to be made in 2013 or 2014.' Mr Hayden's explanation comes just two days after President Obama publicly confirmed that American forces will be taking a number of less violent actions in an effort to dissuade Iran from doing anything drastic. The New York Times reported that tougher sanctions on Iranian oil, a new antimissile system based out of Qatar that is specialized for the region, and varied naval exercises will show that America will get directly involved if Iran strikes.","Former director Michael Hayden spoke to an Israeli newspaper .

"British soldiers have been banned from shouting at insurgent terror suspects, banging their fists on tables or walls, or using 'insulting words' in new 'soft-touch' rules for interrogation. Military chiefs have warned that troops are 'no longer able' to carry out tactical questioning, placing the lives of soldiers at serious risk. The revised 'Challenge Direct' regulations were introduced after Iraqi detainee Baha Mousa died in custody with 93 injuries after being kicked and punched by soldiers in Basra. But there is said to be growing concern within the ranks as troops believe the latest rules are so strict that it makes interrogation pointless. WARNING GRAPHIC CONTENT . British soldiers have been banned from shouting at insurgent terror suspects after a series of legal cases. This picture was released as part of the inquiry into the death of Baha Mousa . This comes days after it emerged that the CIA subjected detainees to controversial torture techniques including waterboarding, 'rectal feeding' and sleep deprivation. Despite the global outrage, British military chiefs still fear the current restrictions on interrogators could hinder the gathering of vital information which could prevent terrorist attacks. There is also growing concern that soldiers could be exposed to legal claims and possible disciplinary action as the rules are so easily breached. Colonel Tim Collins, a retired Northern Irish military officer, said the rules on interrogations have been tightened up because of the lawyers since he left the British Army. 'The effect of the ambulance-chasing lawyers and the play-it-safe judges is that we have got to the point where we have lost our operational capability to do tactical questioning. That in itself brings risks to the lives of the people we deploy,' he told The Telegraph. The revised 'Challenge Direct' regulations were introduced after Iraqi detainee Baha Mousa (pictured) died in custody with 93 injuries after being kicked and punched by soldiers in Basra . 'These insurgents are not nice people. These are criminals. They behead people; they keep sex slaves. They are not normal people.' The previous policy - known as 'Harsh' – allowed soldiers to show 'psychotic tendencies', and aim 'personal abuse' at a captive who could be 'taunted and goaded'. They were permitted to 'shout as loud as possible [with] uncontrolled fury' at a captive. The legality of these techniques were brought into question after the death of Baha Mousa, as the innocent civilian was found to have suffered an 'appalling episode of serious gratuitous violence'. An inquiry into his death, published in 2011, disclosed that he had been subjected to sustained beatings by soldiers from 1st Battalion the Queen's Lancashire Regiment in September 2003. These stills were taken from a video of a British soldier screaming abuse at hooded Iraqi detainees . The new guidelines have restricted the use to shouting to a couple of seconds at a time – and is only meant to gain a captive's attention. But these were challenged once again after Iraqi national Haidar Ali Hussein sued the Ministry of Defence saying it should ban soldiers from shouting or making 'stern comments' to detainees. Although Mr Hussein's detention predated the new policy, his legal team argued the technique which involves 'shouting or screaming in a detainee's face' - breaches the Geneva Convention. The Court of Appeal threw out Mr Hussein's challenge - but in doing so disclosed how the technique works and when it can be applied. Lord Justice Lloyd Jones and two fellow Court of Appeal judges ruled the Challenge Direct policy lawful as it did not 'involve any violation of the duty of humane treatment'. But they found a number of breaches, including an interrogator who 'slammed the desk with his hand' and one who 'slammed the wall with his hand'. Colonel Tim Collins (left) said soldiers have 'lost their capability' to do tactical questioning, pictured with hosptial administrator Al Amarah, in central Iraq (right) Defence Secretary Michael Fallon, the Defence Secretary, has said he is concerned about the rising cost of legal cases and the scrutiny on British troops. 'What's important for us is to understand the legal scrutiny that we are under all the time now, the cases that are being brought sometimes spuriously by law firms representing people who claim they were wrongly detained. 'Our Armed Forces are under a huge degree of scrutiny.' He said he feared this could inhibit commanders in the field in future.' A spokesman for the Ministry of Defence said: 'Whilst we will investigate and take appropriate action when there are credible claims of serious mistreatment and abuse, we will defend ourselves from claims that we believe are without merit.' Mr Mousa, a 26 year-old father-of-two, died after sustaining 93 injuries while in custody in Basra, southern Iraq, in 2003. Soldiers wrongly believed the Iraqi national was involved in the murder of four of their colleagues. He and nine other men were forced to endure beatings, kickings and karate chops in conditions of intense heat and extreme squalour. The £13 million public inquiry into the hotel receptionist's death found he had suffered 'an 'appalling episode of serious gratuitous violence'. The detainees' accounts included claims of having fingers pressed in their eye sockets, water squeezed into their mouths and being kicked in the genitals and kidneys. Haidar Ali Hussein sued the Ministry of Defence, saying it should ban soldiers from shouting or making 'stern comments' to detainees. The Iraqi civilian was arrested in 2004 and alleged that during his detention he had been subjected 'to substantial periods of shouting'. He said he wanted the interrogation method 'Challenge Direct' to be outlawed in warzones. Despite the fact that the policy had been amended in the wake of the Baha Mousa inquiry, he argued it was still unlawful because it constitutes 'inhumane treatment' which goes against the Geneva Convention. The Court of Appeal threw out Mr Hussein's challenge to the interrogation policy — but in doing so disclosed how the technique works and when it can be applied.","Military chiefs warned troops are 'not able' to interrogate terror suspects .

"A mystery meat, which has defied the best efforts of scientists to identify it, has been found in a lamb curry as part of an investigation into food fraud. The discovery raises new questions about just what is going into the nation’s takeaways and processed foods. A BBC documentary to be aired on BBC3 tonight sent samples of curries and kebabs bought from six outlets in London for laboratory tests. Tests: A documentary team sent meat samples from six London takeaways to be tested. Meat from one lamb curry could not be identified as originating from any common meat source (stock image) The meat in a Beef in Black Bean Sauce dish turned out to contain high levels of chicken material including blood, while a burger contained no beef at all, other than blood and heart. However, most alarming of all was a curry. A spokesman for the programme said: ‘Just when we thought things couldn't get any worse, the results came in for an Indian Lamb Curry. ‘It did contain meat, but that meat was not lamb, not pork, nor was it chicken or beef. Not horse, and not goat either.’ Worry: A burger that was tested contained no beef at all, other than blood and heart . All of the many tests to date by the lab used by the programme have failed to identify exactly which animal was the source of the meat. The revelation raises many grim possibilities. There is evidence from Spain, for example, of meat from dog carcasses being processed for use in pet food. This is not the first time that a question mark has been put over the content of the take-out dishes eaten by millions of Britons every day. Just last year, a survey of 20 lamb curries in the West Midlands found all had been bulked up with cheaper beef, pork and chicken. Amazingly, four contained no lamb at all, rather the outlets used either beef or chicken which was hidden beneath a powerful and spicy sauce. At the same time, a meat cutting plant in Wales has been accused of supplying horsemeat from an abattoir in Yorkshire to companies making kebabs and burgers for hundreds of independent take-aways. The discovery of horsemeat in big brand products sold by supermarkets like Tesco and Asda, together with chains like Burger King and big brands from Birds Eye to Findus, has changed the nation’s shopping habits. The implication of take-out curries in food fraud could also hit the industry hard.

"Out of a job? Amy Pascal is the co-chairman of Sony Pictures Entertainment, and may lose her job over emails leaked online in the recent company hack. Pictured above at the Los Angeles premiere of film The Interview . For calling Leonardo DiCaprio 'despicable' and being involved in an email exchange describing Angelina Jolie as a 'spoiled brat', Amy Pascal may lose her job. Hollywood has been an awkward place for the 56-year-old Sony executive ever since hackers released hundreds of company documents online - including her candid show-business emails. The hack is thought to be a response to the release of Sony film The Interview, which makes fun of North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un. The group believed to be behind the attack has ties to the North Korean regime. And it seems the hack is doing the destruction the group envisioned, as sources told the New York Daily News that Pascal could be getting sacked for comments made in the private emails. 'Amy will be getting fired to set an example,' the source told the Daily News on Saturday. 'Everyone is really upset because Amy is beloved and a good person.' The anonymous source went on to say that Pascal's previously stellar reputation made the emails all the more surprising, and have damaged the company as a whole. One of the most offensive comments made by Pascal in the emails, was in reference to President Obama's film preferences. In an email exchange about what she should talk to the president about at an event, she asked 'Should I ask him if he liked DJANGO?' before going on to list other movies about slavery. For that racially-insensitive comment, Pascal issued a public apology to the White House and had to humble herself in a phone call with the Reverend Al Sharpton - who has become the president's private adviser on civil rights issues. 'She kept saying over and over again that’s not who she is,' Sharpton told the Daily News about his chat with Pascal. 'She apologized over and over. But I told her that when I listen to the words, if they were said by somebody of another race about somebody of another race, they would not be tolerated.' And the president isn't the only one offended in her emails. Pascal also takes shots at Leonardo DiCpario and Angelina Jolie. DiCaprio was one of the main A-list actors trying out for a role in the studio's planned biopic of Steve Jobs. Payback: The hack was believed to be carried out as retribution for Sony releasing The Interview, a movie mocking the North Korean regime and starring James Franco (left) and Seth Rogen (right) It seems DiCpario was offered the role first but turned it down, with producer Mark Gordon emailing Pascal about the actor's 'horrible behavior'. Pascal agrees, calling DiCaprio 'actually despicable'. She was also involved in a nasty exchange of words concerning actress Angelina Jolie. The actress was insulted in an email exchange between Pascal and producer Scott Rudin, as the two got into an argument over whether director David Fincher should work on the Jobs biopic or a Cleopatra movie starring Jolie. Rudin, who bought the script to the studios, wrote: 'YOU BETTER SHUT ANGIE DOWN BEFORE SHE MAKES IT VERY HARD FOR DAVID TO DO JOBS.' Popular producer: Before the hack, Pascal had a good reputation in Hollywood, which made the candid emails all the more surprising. Pictured above with Ashton Kutcher (left) and Drew Barrymore (right) Pascal then hit back: 'Do not f**king threaten me. I have been asking you to engage with me on this for weeks.' To which Rudin responded: 'What the hell are you talking about? Who's threatening you? Let me remind you I brought this material to you and I can off her from it in a phone call. Don't for one second even think about trying this s**t with me.' 'There is no movie of Cleopatra to be made (and how that is a bad thing given the insanity and rampaging spoiled ego of this woman and the cost of the movie is beyond me) and if you won't tell her that you do not like the script - which, let me remind you, SHE DOESN'T EITHER - this will just spin even further out into Crazyland but let me tell you I have zero appetite for the indulgence of spoiled brats and I will tell her this myself if you don't.' Pascal awkwardly had to face Jolie last week when the two attended the annual women in entertainment breakfast. If looks could kill: Pascal has an awkward embrace at a recent breakfast after emails sent to her called Jolie a 'spoiled brat' However, Jolie has since pulled out of promoting her new Sony-produced movie Unbroken, about an American Olympian taken  by the Japanese as a prisoner of war during World War II, citing a chicken pox infection. Jolie even released a picture of herself, sores and all, but Sony executives say the illness is made up to spite Pascal. Other Sony secrets revealed in the hack, was the company's plans for a Ghostbusters remake, the entire script for the new James Bond movie and the salaries for actors like James Franco and Seth Rogen.","Source told the New York Daily News that the Sony co-chairman will be fired to 'set an example'

"A British film maker who 'married' a tribal warrior says she agreed to it to highlight the oil giants destroying his Amazon home. Sarah Begum underwent the symbolic ritual aged just 21 after she left London to spend two weeks with the Huaroani tribe, which has 3,000 members in the mineral-rich Ecuadorian rainforest. Despite historically tense relations with outsiders dating to the 1950s, when five U.S. missionaries who tried to infiltrate the tribe were killed, she claimed she was welcomed with open arms. Scroll down for video . Marriage: Londoner Sarah Begum (right), just 21 at the time, was surprised to be married off to a tribal warrior named Ginkto who was 30 years her senior (left) - as a symbolic gesture to spread their plea against oil firms . Ceremony: Ms Begum was given a crown made from macaw feathers in the naked ceremony. She said: 'I thought, ""I can't get naked, this is being filmed"", and for a split second I thought about running away' She learned how to weave with grasses and hunt with a blowpipe, and by the end of the period she had 'married' a warrior in his 50s named Ginkto - who spoke only the villagers' own Huaroani dialect and a few words of Spanish. It was a symbolic gesture to spread the tribe's plea for help against oil firms, not a legally binding marriage - but the language barrier meant things were not obvious at the start. 'I was chosen by the elders and I had no idea what was going to happen to me,' she said. 'I was called into a hut and everyone inside was naked. I was told they were making me their traditional clothes, which is a piece of string made of plant fibres worn around the waist – not even a thong. 'I thought, ""I can't get naked, this is being filmed"", and for a split second I thought about running away, but I wanted to fully embrace and understand their traditions. 'One of the women pulled off my underwear, and I gave in from there. The elder leader was chanting and the women were making chicha, their home-brewed beverage. Learning: Although the tribe faces threats from the outside world, Ms Begum said she was surprised at the open welcome she received, and she was taught how to do traditional weaving by the women in the tribe . Explorer: Ms Begum made her experiences into a documentary film which was screened at Cannes last year . 'They were happy that I was totally naked and started to make a crown for me out of macaw feathers. 'I was told, ""they are going to make you Queen"". I was surrounded by the women and warriors chanting and dancing in the hut - I thought I was being initiated. 'They gave me the chicha drink and the name Imaca, which means The Last Name, before marrying me to my husband-to-be, the tribe's most popular warrior, Ginkto.' 'I had no idea what was going on. At first I thought it was just an initiation ceremony but then there was this guy next to me who had his arms around me. It was so surreal.' She said she was shocked at first, but it was explained that she was not expected to have a sexual relationship with Ginkto. Instead the marriage was an honorary one to build trust with the tribe. 'They knew why I was there and wanted to show me how they lived', she said. 'Ginkto is a lovely guy and a strong hunter, which makes him very popular with the women. He was also very funny and curious about my life in London. 'We communicated through one of the other warriors who spoke Spanish to my cameraman. He asked all about my parents, my family and friends.' Ms Begum was one of many 'eco-tourists' and documentary makers hosted by the tribe over the years, but insisted the wedding ceremony was a rare occurrence. However, she was not the only Briton who Ginkto  'married'. Two years earlier the same tribal warrior 'wed' Karen Morris-Lanz, a single mother from Milton Keynes who went to live briefly in the village. In that case, however, it was for a BBC documentary specifically about marriage. 'We're now friends', said Ms Bergum. 'It's led to quite a lot of jokes'. Adventure: The young explorer said she had wanted to visit the tribes of the Amazon since the age of nine . Boat: The journey to the Huaroani people's village took two days by boat from the nearest town . Now 26, Ms Begum made her experiences into a half-hour documentary, Amazon Souls, which was shown at the Cannes Film Festival last year. Since then it has been accepted at the Sheffield Doc/Fest and Adventure Travel Film Festival, and this year Ms Begum was made a Fellow of the Royal Geographical Society. She was finishing a film degree at Kingston University in Surrey when she set off on her self-funded trip in 2010 to Ecuador's Yasuni National Park, fulfilling a dream which began when she was nine. 'By the time I was in film school I felt I wasn't really being prepared for the real world,' she said. 'I wanted to do something with my life and for my future so I decided to literally follow my dream. 'I quit my job, used all my savings, hired a cinematographer from New York and a sound guy from Portsmouth. I did some research about this tribe in the Amazon and just went there.' She won the 5,800-mile air fare as one of ten finalists in the national Enterprising Student Awards - the only woman that year. Other funds came from private investors before the trip. Once in Ecuador she met her colleagues, British sound engineer Stephen Bull and American cinematographer Frank Angelcyk, and taught English to children in the Amazon region before venturing deeper into the jungle. Hitches: She was taught how to hunt, and nature fought back - her sound engineer was airlifted to hospital . Clip: A still from the documentary. Communication was difficult at times, as the tribe speaks its own dialect . Despite not being able to swim, she travelled by boat for two days from the town of Coca through piranha and alligator infested waters, stopping overnight at a beach to fish for dinner. During the journey she and her companions met representatives from the tribe, who had been contacted by outsiders before and have their own reserve near the national park agreed with Ecuador's authorities. Once in the village of Bameno it was not plain sailing - Mr Bull had to be airlifted to hospital when a cut to his arm became infected, and she was bitten by parasites and developed a stomach infection - but she said the villagers were keen to tell her about their plight at the hand of oil companies. The Huaroani people live on top of some of South America's richest oil reserves, and campaigners say the invasion of outsiders has increased tension in their ancestral land. Hostility began in 1956, when five evangelical missionaries from the U.S. were killed after trying to convert Huaroani villagers to Christianity in a widely-publicised case. It is said to have been the first documented time the tribe was contacted by the outside world. Nowadays contact with outsiders is more common - some tribe members have taken to wearing western clothing - but is still not always for the right reasons. Friends abroad: Ms Begum with tribe members including her 'husband' Ginkto. Contact with outsiders was more common in recent decades. Some wear Western clothes - though others remain utterly uncontacted . Friends at home: Ms Begum, second from left, with friends at a film meet-up in London after her return . As well as oil there are mineral reserves beneath the rainforest and it is a target for illegal loggers. Several roads have been built into Huaroani territory. Tribe members told a BBC documentary in 2011 that they could no longer grow food on river banks because they feared contamination would wash downstream. And last year the charity Survival International, which campaigns for indigenous people's rights, said two Huaroani members were killed by fellow tribespeople as competition for land increased. Tribal leader Cawetipe Yeti said at the time: 'This is not a tourist zone. This is an area in a state of red alert. 'We’re asking the authorities to act immediately on our request to provide logistical support to protect our uncontacted Taromenane brothers.' Ms Begum said she still keeps occasional contact with the tribe members over e-mail and even on Facebook, when they make the rare trip to the nearest town. 'I would love to go back to see them all again,' she said.","Sarah Begum quit her job in London aged 21 to study Huaroani tribe .

"As former Vice President Dick Cheney argued on Sunday that the CIA's aggressive interrogation of terrorism suspects did not amount to torture, the man who provided the legal rationale for the program said that in some cases it had perhaps gone too far. Former Justice Department lawyer John Yoo said the sleep deprivation, rectal feeding and other harsh treatment outlined in a U.S. Senate report last week could violate anti-torture laws. Yoo said on CNN's 'Fareed Zakaria GPS' 'If these things happened as they’re described in the report, as you describe them, those were not authorized by the Justice Department. They were not supposed to be done and those people who did those are at risk legally because they were acting outside their orders.' Scroll down for video . Speaking out: Former Justice Department lawyer John Yoo said the sleep deprivation, rectal feeding and other harsh treatment outlined in a U.S. Senate report last week could violate anti-torture laws . As Deputy Assistant U.S. Attorney General in the Office of Legal Counsel in 2002, Yoo co-wrote a memo that was used as the legal sanction for what the CIA called its program of enhanced interrogation techniques after the Sept. 11 attacks. The memo said only prolonged mental harm or serious physical injury, such as organ failure, violated the Geneva Convention's ban on torture. Aggressive interrogation methods like waterboarding fell short of that mark. Yoo's comments on Sunday contrasted with those of Cheney and former national security officials who invoke his memo to argue that the harsh treatment of detainees was legal. 'They specifically authorized and okayed what we did,' Cheney said on NBC's 'Meet the Press.' 'No one tortured anybody else,' former CIA counter terrorism head Jose Rodriguez said during his interview with Chris Wallace of 'Fox News Sunday.' The Senate Intelligence Committee's review of 6.3 million pages of CIA documents, released on Tuesday, found that some captives were deprived of sleep for more than a week, at times with their hands shackled above their heads, while others were abused sexually. 'Looking at it now, I think of course you can do these things cumulatively or too much that it would cross the line of the anti-torture statute,' Yoo said on the C-SPAN television network. Former CIA counter terrorism head Jose Rodriguez (seen in this file photo) said Sunday ''No one tortured anybody else' He questioned whether the report's findings were reliable, given it was produced only by Democrats who had a political incentive to cherry-pick the worst examples. The report concluded the CIA misled the White House and the public about the program and failed to disrupt a single plot. Those findings have been disputed by former CIA officials. Cheney said he was not concerned that the torture program ensnared victims of mistaken identity, and said he had no regrets. He said on NBC's 'Meet the Press,' 'I have no problem, as long as we achieve our objective. And our objective is to get the guys who did 9/11, and it is to avoid another attack against the United States. I was prepared, and we did, we got the authorization from the president and the authorization from the Justice Department to go forward to the program. It worked. It worked now for 13 years. He continued 'We've avoided another mass casualty attack against the United States, we did capture Bin Laden, we did capture an awful lot of the senior guys of al-Qaeda who were responsible for that attack on 9/11. I'd do it again in a minute.'","Former Justice Department lawyer John Yoo said the sleep deprivation, rectal feeding and other harsh treatment outlined in a U.S. Senate report last week could violate anti-torture laws .

"Ordeal: Samir Naji, from Yemen, wrote a graphic account of his time in Guantanamo . Scroll down for video . A Guantanamo inmate who has been held in Bay for more than 13 years has given a graphic and harrowing account of his time imprisoned by U.S. authorities. Samir Naji, a Yemeni who was suspected of being a security guard to Osama bin Laden but never charged with a crime, wrote how he was drugged, sexually abused, beaten and trampled in the notorious prison. Naji, who was cleared for release five years ago but has yet to be let go, said guards would work in shifts to subject him to brutal, continuous interrogations lasting three months at a time. In a first-person account published by CNN, Naji told how he would be abused beyond the point of collapse, and prison guards would watch over him in hospital, waiting for the moment he was cleared for release so the process could start again. The inmate - who insists on his innocence - says his prolonged torture 'achieved nothing', but brought 'shame' on the United States. In the account, he wrote: 'I think my first period of interrogation lasted three full months. Two teams of interrogators running shifts, day and night. 'Each session begins with shouting, to wake me up. Then they hit me on the face and the back. I am so desperate for sleep, my head is swimming. 'There are photographs of faces stuck all around the walls of this room. They demand that I identify the individuals, but I can barely focus to see if I might know them.' He  describes being injected and knocked out when it is obvious he will be of no use identifying the men. Imprisoned: Naji said his interrogation sessions - which yielded no results - would last for months on end (file photo) Incarcerated: Naji spent more than a decade in Guantanamo - and despite being cleared for release in 2009 is still there . Naji also says that he tried to go on hunger strike, but was laughed at, had food poured on him and was then force-fed intravenously. When he eventually gave in, he said: 'I tell the interrogators that I can't face not eating any more. They throw food on the floor of the room and tell me to eat like a pig. 'They won't let me go to the restroom. They watch as it gets more painful, and laugh as they get the translator to describe how they will rape me if I pee in my pants.' Naji also describes psychologically damaging routines that Guantanamo guards would act out - including showing him images of bestiality - a man having sex with a donkey - and videos of other prisoners being abused. He added that guards shaved off his beard in what he terms 'a gratuitous insult to my religion.' Bundled out: Naji (who is not pictured in the file photo above) also spoke of psychologically damaging acts - such as forcing him to watch films of bestiality, and forcibly shaving off his beard . The account was prompted by the release of a lengthy CIA report on torture, which has caused outrage among lawmakers, the public and other nations. However, Naji points out that the torture report does not cover the situation . The Obama administration has a long-held ambition to shut down Guantanamo Bay, but the process has taken longer than hoped - partly because it is difficult to find somewhere to send prisoners once they are released. This week six former inmates were rehomed in Uruguay after being held for more than a dozen years. The six men - four Syrians, a Tunisian and a Palestinian - were accepted by the South American country as refugees and were seen walking around the capital city of Montevideo, seemingly enjoying their freedom.

"George W Bush doesn't readily offer political opinions. But when it comes to portraits, he has some broad-brush advice. 'Never paint your wife or your mother.' Bush's new book about his father includes a portrait he painted of his dad, the 41st president. A word of warning: George W Bush said his wife did not like his painting of her so it won't see the light of day . Strong critics: The former president's mother (pictured) is also critical of his work, Bush revealed . Bush tells CNN's 'State of the Union' that 'I think it's nice,' but his tough-to-please mother 'kind of wasn't' happy with it. The 43rd president also painted his wife, Laura. The verdict? She didn't like it and neither did one of their daughters, 'so I just scrapped it.' Well, maybe not. 'I may have saved it although they probably think I destroyed it.' Tender rendition: This is Bush's depiction of his father and predecessor-but-one, George H W Bush . Broad brush strokes: All of the paintings, like this self portrait, are created using thick lines and bold colors . Bush has said that an essay by Winston Churchill on painting inspired him to take lessons after leaving office. Speaking about his artistic process, he told the Today Show: 'I was very proud to be standing next to a man I admire greatly. 'First thing I wanted to make sure is I got the noses right. I've tried to paint a gentle soul, and I did it. As for me, I kind of bumbled through.' Last year, a hacker leaked his images of animals, landscapes and self portraits, such as him in the bath. 'I was annoyed,' Bush said. 'It's an invasion of one's privacy... nor do I want my paintings to get out. Encounters: Bush draws on his experiences as the leader of the U.S. to find inspiration, such as this of Putin . A painted portrait of Afghanistan President Hamid Karzai by former President George W. Bush in 'The Art of Leadership: A President's Personal Diplomacy' exhibition in Dallas earlier this year . Clockwise from bottom left: Portraits of former  President Nicolas Sarkozy of France, Prime Minister Stephen Harper of Canada,  Abu Dhabi's Mohammed bin Zayed, and former president of South Korea, Lee Myung-bak . 'The truth of the matter is my paintings are not ready to be released. I mean, I'm still learning, and I don't know if they ever will be or not.' He also reflected on what others think of his work. 'People are surprised,' Bush said. 'Of course, some people are surprised I can even read.' In March last year, an artist who taught Bush how to paint both animals and landscapes in a recent month-long course spoke out his skills as a late-in-life painter. He had spent four weeks in private lessons alongside his sister-in-law in a home in Boca Grande, Florida where they improved their technique and expanded their artistic horizons. 'He has such a passion for painting, it's amazing,' said instructor Bonnie Flood.","George W Bush's new book about his father includes his portrait .

"A terrorist act in Martin Place was allegedly the plan of accused Sydney man, Omarjan Azari, who is due to make a bail application this week in Central Local Court, just  blocks away from the Lindt cafe. It was alleged that 22-year-old Azari,who was arrested on terrorism charges in September, was planning a public beheading in Martin Place. The alleged terror plot, mentioned in a conversation between Australian terrorism recruiter in Syria, Mohammad Ali Baryalei and Azari, involved selecting a member of the public at random, beheading them and then covering their body in an Islamic flag.

"With Christmas approaching, Suzie Oulton was determined to treat her four closest friends to a top-notch gift. So the 38-year-old was delighted when she spotted scented candles from luxury fragrance brand Jo Malone being sold on eBay for £18 — £4 less than their usual retail price. 'I'm a great fan of Jo Malone products but I have a tight budget,' says Suzie, who runs her own company and lives with husband Chris, 40 and 15-month-old Harry in Lydham, Shropshire. Spot the difference: A real Jo Malone candle, left, and a fake, right . 'I checked they were being sold by an established seller and scanned the reviews. Previous customers seemed satisfied so I thought I had found a bargain.' But a week later, Suzie was to discover that the candles she'd bought were anything but a good deal. In fact, they were a potential death trap. She had unwittingly fallen for what experts have dubbed the new wave of 'middle-class fakes'. These are copycat goods — often priced almost as high as the original, so as not to arouse suspicion — and replicas of everyday brands popular with middle England, rather than copies of designer goods. Other mid-market labels now on the counterfeiters' hit list include Cath Kidston, Hunter wellies, Links Of London, ghd hair products and top make-up brands. A Which? survey concludes that one in ten shoppers have unwittingly bought a fake, with 7 per cent of goods sold in the UK are said to be counterfeit. Conned: Suzie, from Lyndham, with her son Harry, 15 months. She bought counterfeit Jo Malone candles that were a potential deathtrap . Shopping online is a particular minefield. In April, a specialist police unit shut down more than 2,500 websites selling counterfeit goods to British customers that were believed to be worth tens of millions of pounds. But with an estimated 72 million web links to infringing material this year alone, this is a drop in the ocean. With Christmas fast approaching, shoppers are trawling the internet for last-minute bargains — and you can be sure criminals are on the prowl to get some of this money. 'Behind many of these websites lies an organised crime gang funnelling off the money spent by unsuspecting customers on what they think are quality products,' says Detective Chief Inspector Andy Fyfe, head of the Police Intellectual Property Crime Unit. 'Consumers also need to be aware that by accessing websites like this they are running the risk of their personal details being compromised and being used for other fraudulent scams, as well as exposing their computer to viruses.' A trip to one of Kent Trading Standards' warehouses to the south of Maidstone in Kent provides ample evidence of the problem. Here, the team is working its way through two recent shipments of dodgy goods intercepted at Dover, targeted at Christmas shoppers. Counterfeit designer goods are worth £3 billion a year in the UK — sometimes even experts struggle to spot the fakes . Among the 5,470 seized items were 1,960 toys, including 426 copies of dolls from the Disney film Frozen. In the second consignment seized, there were more than 4,000 counterfeit ghd hair straighteners, intended to be passed off as the real thing. Meanwhile, in a separate locked container are bags of other counterfeit goods that have been confiscated over the past 18 months. It's a roll call of all the most popular High Street brands. There are piles of Superdry sweatshirts, fake Hunter wellies, which usually sell for around £90, sacks full of UGG Australia rip-offs and shelves bursting with fake make-up from covetable brands such as Bobbi Brown and Mac. Seventy per cent of these fakes will have hailed from China but they also come from India, Turkey, Indonesia and Thailand. As quickly as officers clamp down on one lot of fake goods, another market springs up as High Street fashions and trends change. Trading Standards regularly seize suspect items. Out of 5,470 recently seized items 1,960 were toys, including 426 copies of dolls from the Disney film Frozen . This year's incredible boom in Frozen merchandise is a case in point. The Disney film has proved to be the most lucrative ever thanks to the appetite for the spin-off goods. But with genuine Frozen toys in short supply in the run up to Christmas, sellers peddling counterfeit versions are moving in. The new iPhone 6 is also on the scammers' hit list. Copies of a new gadget can be manufactured within two weeks of the genuine product hitting the High Street, so counterfeit versions have been flooding in and some are on sale for as little as £18 (the genuine Apple version costs more than £500). Luxury perfumed candles are another boom — the UK market alone is worth £90 million. As one of the most popular brands, Jo Malone finds itself at the forefront of this battle against fakes. With the imitations costing a maximum of £3.50 to produce, there's some serious money to be made — at someone's expense. Regrets: Suzie realised she had been duped the moment she opened her parcel . Suzie Oulton realised she had been duped the moment she opened her parcel. She says: 'The first giveaway was that the jars were not right. The glass was quite thick but one of the candles was broken and the rims weren't at all smooth. 'When I lit one of the candles, it smelt of furniture polish, then spat and crackled like a firework. It was a fire risk.' Angry that she had been tricked, Suzie contacted the seller, who was selling the fake candles on eBay, only to be stonewalled. 'I think it is despicable that someone was willing to sell fake candles to unsuspecting customers. They might be only thinking of making a quick profit but they could have burnt our house down,' she says. Suzie had a lucky escape. Candles from another batch of copied Jo Malone candles exploded when tested by Trading Standards. Counterfeit make-up, meanwhile, can contain banned ingredients such as lead, copper, mercury, arsenic or cadmium, which can lead to swelling, rashes and poisoning. Test on fake perfumes, meanwhile, have found horse urine and harmful ingredients that can cause allergic and skin-burning reactions. Leon Livermore, of the Trading Standards Institute, stresses: 'There are significant risks to buying counterfeit goods, especially electrical products, which could cause fires or shocks — or children's toys, which could be untested and unsafe.' Real deal: Jo Malone finds itself at the forefront of this battle against fakes . But a new breed of ruthless 'entrepreneurs' purposefully targeting middle-class customers is ignoring these dangers . Last week, the BBC programme Fake Britain reported on a case in the Home Counties where two women, Debra Buckingham, 53, and Mary O'Sullivan, 44, were running what amounted to a small cottage industry producing rip-off Jo Malone candles. They were buying in cheap, wax-filled glass jars and then adding fake Jo Malone branding, using stickers printed to look like the original labels. They finished off the job with imported copies of the signature engraved lid. They were then selling these copycat candles at craft fairs, fetes and markets across the South-East at a considerable mark-up. When the South-East Regional Organised Crime Unit visited Buckingham's sixth-floor flat in Hanger Lane, West London, they found a mini production line. There were more than 200 of the inferior candles in jars, at least 10,000 of the fake labels and 4,000 silver lids. 'This pair were really making some quite significant profit,' says Graham Miles, the unit's financial investigator, who estimated the pair had made £210,000 from this illegal operation. The two women have since been successfully prosecuted at Lewes Crown Court, with Buckingham receiving a 12-month custodial sentence and O'Sullivan, who played a lesser role, given 240 hours of community service. Another ploy used by sellers to target middle-class customers is to sell their fake goods at 'hand bag' parties — the successors to Tupperware parties — or on Facebook in order to give themselves a veneer of respectability. Fiona Taylor, 44, of Newton on Ouse in North Yorkshire, sold fake bags for hundreds of pounds by doing this, using her ill-gotten gains to fund a luxury lifestyle that included private school fees, holidays and a new car. Beware when Christmas shopping: If a deal looks too good to be true, it probably is . In August this year, Teeside Crown Court was told that Taylor sold fake Mulberry bags she'd bought from counterfeit suppliers in China and sold them at parties as the real thing. She told her middle-class customers that she got hold of them through a contact at Mulberry's factory. But disgruntled customers contacted Trading Standards when the bags fell to bits. When Taylor's home was searched, a large number of fake Mulberry, Gucci, Louis Vuitton, Prada and Chanel bags were seized. Another of these 'entrepreneurs' rumbled this year is 27-year-old accountant Maddison Hawk from Oxfordshire. Her company Perfect Strand Limited was doing a roaring trade in fake ghd straighteners and hairdryers imported from China — which burst into flames just seconds after being switched on. Oxfordshire Trading Standards team leader Anu Prashar, who helped the prosecution, said a customer could have been seriously injured. 'It was extremely lucky that this happened during a test, rather than when somebody was using the product, as it could have resulted in serious injury.' It seems that as long as our appetite for branded goods continues to grow, so will counterfeiting. And that means there are plenty of greedy, shady sellers hoping to swindle consumers who will be left with shoddy or dangerous products. It's not really in the spirit of Christmas, is it?","More people are falling victim to  the new wave of 'middle-class fakes'

"Martin Hedley, 27, is having his odd-shaped teeth fixed to cure his crippling back pain . A man is having his wonky teeth fixed - to cure crippling back pain he has endured since childhood. Martin Hedley, 27, of Upholland, near Skelmersdale, Lancashire, has suffered bouts of sickening pain when he has been unable to get out of bed because of the agony in his back. Now, he is having his odd-shaped teeth straightened by an expert who says they are to blame for an uneven chewing motion that results in painful neck and back distortion. Mr Hedley has been in constant pain since he was 12 years old and was forced to withdraw from school as the torment became unbearable. His pain has become even more acute in the last six years. Despite numerous appointments with a range of medical experts, nobody could identify the cause of his problem. Determined to end his misery, Mr Hedley conducted his own research and found that badly uneven teeth and a jarring chewing motion can cause severe tension on the skull, leading to pain in the neck and back. It then dawned on him that his shooting pains got worse every time he had a meal. He said: 'Hard foods would be more painful than soft foods. 'It doesn't matter if it's a piece of concrete or a grape, it's the actual motion of bringing your teeth together. If you've got a distortion when they come together, it will affect the rest of your body.' Despite numerous appointments with a range of medical experts, nobody could identify the root of the problem . After conventional medics ran out of ideas, he tried alternative therapies and found people with similar pain to him had been cured by getting their bad teeth mended through 'whole body dentistry'. The treatment involves adding overlays on to teeth to level them off, as well as using orthodontics to straighten teeth and ease pressure on the skull. The pioneer of the treatment is Dr Gerald Smith, based in Philadelphia, and two weeks ago Mr Hedley flew to America for the first of numerous treatments with him to level out his teeth. It has already cost him thousands of pounds but he hopes it will allow him to get his life back on track. He said: 'I would basically get my life back which feels like it's been on hold for six years. Just to get out of bed and not have the first thing in my mind: My back's really painful. 'I've become used to it because it's all I know.' After conventional medics ran out of ideas, he tried alternative therapies and found people with similar pain to him had been cured by getting their bad teeth mended through 'whole body dentistry' Mr Hedley will return to America in early 2015 but is already feeling the benefit of his first session. He said: 'It's not instantaneous but I can feel my bite is a lot better. 'But my body has been in this position so long, it doesn't just instantaneously change - it'll slowly unwind.' Dr Smith said he was confident Mr Hedley's life of pain will soon be resolved. He said: 'This innovative non-invasive technology has been successfully used to resolve many lower back pain problems like Martin's and in many cases helped patients avoid surgery.' Last night, UK-based dentistry expert Malcolm Meneaud, president of the Yorkshire branch of the British Dental Association, said: 'There is a school of thought that poor jaw posture - because the teeth don't meet properly - can have a knock-on effect, causing migranes, neck ache and back ache.'

"The flag displayed by hostages held inside a Sydney cafe by an armed terrorist bears the words 'There is no god but Allah, Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah' written in white Arabic on a black background. Called the Shahada flag, it differs from the black and white flag used by the terror group ISIS, which has carried out beheadings at other atrocities in Syria and Iraq. The flag is used by the extremist group, Jabhat al Nusra, which is fighting the Assad government in Syria. But it has meaning for all Muslims, in that the Shahada is the Islamic Creed, one of the Five Pillars of Islam, which is recited by Muslims when they pray. In reciting the Shahada, a Muslim bears witness that Allah is the only true god, and that Muhammad is Allah’s prophet. Also known as the Al-Nusra Front or Victory Front, Jabhat al-Nusra is a Syrian-based Sunni extremist group that adheres to the global jihadist ideology of Al Qaeda, the group behind the 9/11 attacks in 2001 . Scroll down for video . The Shahada flag displayed in the window of the Lindt cafe (pictured) is used by Jabhat al-Nusra, a Syrian based extremist group but its words in Arabic mean that 'there is not true God but Allah' which is the basic Islamic creed to which all followers bear witness . Symbol of fear: The flag of the extremist group ISIS (pictured) is associated with beheadings of Westerners in Syria and is not the flag used in the Martin Place siege . According to Australian National Security guidelines issued by the Federal Government, Al-Qaeda in Iraq (AQI) sent operatives to Syria in late 2011 for the purpose of establishing Jabhat al-Nusra to fight the regime of President Bashar al-Assad. The group publicly announced its presence in Syria in a January 2012 video statement. In early April 2013, Jabhat al-Nusra pledged allegiance to Al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri and confirmed the group has received funding and operatives from AQI. The stated aims of Jabhat al-Nusra, or JN, are to remove the regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and once this is achieved, to replace it with a Sunni Islamic state. Although the group is affiliated with Al Qaeda, JN has previously not emphasised an attack Western targets or global jihad, focusing instead on the ‘near enemy’ of the Syrian state. The Australian Government says the group has received direct endorsement from online extremist forums aligned with Al Qaeda and leading jihadist figures, but that previously JN had attempted to play down its extremist ideology and conceal its links to AQI to avoid alienating the Syrian population. The flag is held aloft by hostages (pictured) inside the Lindt cafe in Martin Place on Monday . Evacuated: Martin Place (pictured) was evacuated after hostages were taken inside the Lindt cafe and a flag used by the extremist group Jabhat al-Nusra was held up in the cafe window . Jabhat al-Nusra releases videos of its attacks and operations through its media network al-Manara al-Bayda (the White Minaret). Jabhat al-Nusra also intends to establish an Islamist caliphate across the Levantine region (the Middle East). It believes the fight against the Syrian regime is supported by religious texts, and its fighters hope to fulfill 'God's wish' for an 'Islamic caliphate'. Through the experiences of its members who have fought in Iraq and the group's close links to AQI's leadership, Jabhat al-Nusra has reportedly been careful to avoid the most brutal practices of other extremist groups such as al-Qa'ida and ISIS - beheadings, sectarian violence and indiscriminate civilian casualties. Abu-Muhammad al-Jawlani (an alias) is the leader of JN and has links to AQI. He was injured in Syria in April last year. Despite efforts by AQI leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi al-Husseini al-Qurashi to merge with JN, al-Jawlanihas resisted.","The flag displayed in the Martin Place siege is emblem of Jabhat al-Nusra .

"Living a healthy lifestyle could cut your risk of dementia by a third, claim leading health specialists. Analysis by Age UK suggests there are five steps people can take to maintain brain health and reduce their risk of developing diseases such as Alzheimer’s. The review of academic studies and data reveals that lifestyle contributes to about three-quarters of cognitive decline, the type of changes in thinking skills which increase with age including memory loss and speed of thinking. Scroll down for video . Analysis by Age UK suggests there are five steps people can take to maintain brain health (file image) A major study included in the review found men who followed five tips for healthy living had a 36 per cent lower risk of developing cognitive decline and a 36 per cent lower risk of developing dementia than those who did not. The key factors were taking regular exercise, not smoking, a healthy bodyweight, eating a Mediterranean diet and a low alcohol intake. The advice has become increasingly familiar from other research that shows staying slim, eating lots of fruit and vegetables, exercising regularly, never smoking, and drinking in moderation is the recipe for dementia-free longevity. The new findings come from The Disconnected Mind, an Age UK funded research project into how thinking skills alter with age, which suggests that changing lifestyle can result in health benefits. The review, which included the latest international dementia studies, also found that preventing and treating diabetes, high blood pressure and obesity could reduce the risk of dementia. The review highlighted the importance of physical exercise – aerobic, resistance or balance - as the most effective way to ward off cognitive decline in healthy older people and reduce the risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease. Studies suggest that exercise three to five times a week for between 30 minutes and an hour is beneficial. In the UK, adults are urged to do 150 minutes of activity a week to promote health but barely a third manage it. It found that there are significantly more new cases of Alzheimer’s among current smokers compared with those who have never smoked. The review also backed up claims that very heavy drinking is also linked to dementia, resulting in the loss of brain tissue particularly in the parts of the brain responsible for memory and processing and interpreting visual information. A healthy weight is a ‘healthy’ body mass index (BMI) score. BMI is assessed by comparing height to weight, in a calculation which divides weight in kilos by height in metres squared. A healthy score is between 18.5 and 24.99 – above is overweight and obese. Never smoking is recommended, but smokers who give up by the age of 40 can gain 10 years of extra life, claim scientists. The Mediterranean diet is high in fish, nuts, whole grains and ‘healthy’ fats such as those in olive oil, while low in red meat and dairy products. Studies suggest three to five or more portions of fruit and vegetables with fat making up less than 30 per cent of calories. Doing exercise three to five times a week for between 30 minutes and an hour is recommended. In the UK, adults are urged to do 150 minutes of activity a week to promote health but barely a third manage it. Low or moderate alcohol consumption is classified as three or fewer units per day for men, two or fewer for women, with abstinence not treated as a healthy behaviour. A small 125ml glass of wine contains 1.3 units, while a pint of beer contains at least two units. But moderate levels of alcohol protect brain tissue by increasing good cholesterol and lowering bad cholesterol. According to the latest estimates, there are 850,000 people in the UK living with dementia. Caroline Abrahams, Charity Director of Age UK said ‘While there’s still no cure or way to reverse dementia, this evidence shows that there are simple and effective ways to reduce our risk of developing it to begin with. ‘What’s more, the changes that we need to make to keep our brains healthy are already proven to be good for the heart and overall health, so it’s common sense for us all to try to build them into our lives. The sooner we start, the better our chance of having a healthy later life.’ Dr Matthew Norton, head of policy at Alzheimer’s Research UK, said ‘This review of existing research highlights a growing body of evidence suggesting that lifestyle factors play an important role in our risk of dementia and cognitive decline. ‘It’s now recognised across public health authorities that lifestyle changes could contribute to reducing dementia risk. It’s now time for these messages to start reaching the public to help empower people protect their cognitive health as they grow older. ‘A number of studies have suggested that what’s good for the heart is good for the brain, and we know that regular exercise, eating a healthy diet, not smoking and not drinking too much can help to reduce the risk of dementia. ‘Evidence also suggests that controlling blood pressure and keeping weight in check may help to lower the risk of the condition. ‘It’s important to remember that diseases like Alzheimer’s are complex and are likely to be caused by a mixture of genetic and environmental factors, which are still not fully understood’ he added.","Research by Age UK found five lifestyle factors which may cut risk .

"Forget a few baubles and a wreath, for middle-America’s most fanatically festive families, Christmas decorations include 100 trees, six foot Santas and lights so bright, pilots at the local airport use them as a beacon. The ostentatious families are the stars of a new U.S. TV show that's made it's way to the UK this month. The Great Christmas Light Fight, which airs on truTV, follows America’s most fanatically festive families. Feeling festive: A new TV show sees Christmas-obsessed families across America competing for a £30,000 prize fund . Each episode takes decking the halls to the absolute extreme, as households compete to create the most over-the-top Christmas light displays to win a £31,000 ($50,000) cash prize. Hosted by judges Michael Moloney and Sabrina Soto, each family has just three weeks to transform their home for the holidays, working around the clock as they pit their wits against each other to create the most ridiculously elaborate illuminations. Judged on rigorous and strict criteria that ranges from use of lights, overall design and Christmas spirit, their displays feature six foot Santas, luminous snowmen, glowing reindeer and metres and metres of coloured lights  in the most astonishing display of festive cheer. Competition: Each family has just three weeks to transform their home for the holidays, working around the clock as they pit their wits against each other to create the most ridiculously elaborate illuminations . Battle: Each episode takes decking the halls to the absolute extreme, as households compete to create the most over-the-top Christmas light displays to win a £31,000 cash prize . One of the families featured, the Baughmans from Dallas, adorn their house with 100,000 lights, 100 Christmas trees and 16 Christmas-themed arches. They take the whole process so seriously that they spend all year prepping and programming the lights, spend two months setting up and are known as local celebrities thanks to their display. Giving them a run for their money is the Downs family from Oklahoma. The Downs family Christmas display is one of the largest musically synchronized displays in the country. The display has become such a spectacle that an average of 20,000 cars attend each year and on Christmas Eve last year, they had close to 5,000 cars driving by. Winter wonderland: This home features a Ferris wheel, 80 ft ski lift and 180,000 lights and pilots at the local airport even use their home as a beacon during the holiday season . Shine bright: Each house is judged on rigorous and strict criteria that ranges from use of lights, overall design and Christmas spirit . Mark and Kathy from Miama have been doing their display since 1990 when they tied the knot. The family spends a total of five hours, three days a week for three months to get their display ready in time for the holidays. They believe their Ferris wheel, 80 ft ski lift and 180,000 lights are what set their display apart from others. Pilots at the local airport even use their home as a beacon during the holiday season. New Yorker Kevin Lynch, 54, has been doing his display for 16 years and it normally takes seven weeks and over 300 hours to put it up. He has over 300,000 lights and 350 figures and has received awards from US Senator Patavan and City Councilman Tony Avella. Classic: This home is all about the fairy lights but for others,  Christmas decorations include 100 trees and six foot Santas . Les Mize, 68, has been decorating his  home in San Francisco for 43 years. What started as a mere Mickey Mouse and Disney memorabilia collection has become a full-blown obsession. Patty, his wife, tries to keep Les in check and the decorations under control but finds it difficult to squash Les’s Christmas spirit. The house takes 294 hours to decorate, uses 200,000 lights just on the exterior, has over 400 Mickeys in the garage display alone, has 10,000 visitors over a three week period and has become known as the Mickey Mouse Christmas House. The Blount family from Los Angeles, meanwhile, turn their display into a charitable affair. Father Andrew, a CEO of a software company, likes to give back to the community and last year they displayed 120,000 lights and served tonnes of warm apple cider to faithful visitors. The Blounts even have a tree shipped in from Siberia each year. Over-the-top: Some of the families get so carried away that they spend days decorating their homes and have hundreds of people visiting . Spectacle: Some displays have an average of 20,000 cars attending each year .

"Model Debbie Baigrie was walking to her car in down town Tampa Bay when a 13-year-old Ian Manuel approached her. The youngster and a friend demanded change for a $20 bill, but seconds later the boy drew his gun and shot her in the mouth. Baigrie, who was 28 at the time and had just had her second child, required years of facial reconstructive surgery while Manuel was charged with attempted murder and sentenced to three consecutive life sentences in an adult prison. But more than 25 years after the attack the pair have struck up an unlikely friendship, and now she is campaigning for his release. Pictured during a court appearance in 2011, Ian Manuel (left) looks back at Debbie Baigrie (right) who he shot in Tampa Bay, Florida, in 1990. She is now campaigning for his release . She feels sympathy for the shooter, because he was so young at the time, and is troubled by the racial discrimination in the case. 'If he was a cute white boy at 13, with little dimples and blue eyes, there's no way this would have happened,' she told the New York Times. 'When you're 13, you do stupid stuff,' she adds before saying 'Walk a mile in his shoes.' Their correspondence began the second Christmas of Manuel's sentence when he decided to call her. She asked him bluntly why he killed her, he said it was a 'mistake'. He then sent her a card with a picture of a hand reaching through prison bars to offer a red rose. Baigrie said: 'I was in such pain. I couldn't eat. I was angry. But I'd go back and forth. He was just a kid.' The pair have sent letters back and forth for almost two decades. In one Manuel wrote: 'You are about one in a million who would write to a person that’s tried to take their life.' The mother required years of painful  reconstructive surgeries to her face but now feels sympathy for Manuel, saying that 'When you're 13, you do stupid stuff' Baigrie maintains that she is the only family Manuel has left - as his mother, father and brother are all dead. Manuel was initially given three life sentences, but a Supreme Court decision stating that juveniles could not be given life without parole for charges other than murder means his term was reduced. He is now scheduled to be released in 2031. His time in prison has been torrid. He was placed in solitary confinement at age 15 and would stay there until the age of 33. At points he would cut himself, repeatedly attempted suicide and is a diagnosed sociopath. For 18 years Baigrie has been running Natural Muscle Magazine.","Debbie Baigrie was shot in the face by Ian Manuel in Tampa Bay in 1990 .

"On parade: Prince George, resplendent in his marching guardsman tank top, strikes a relaxed pose . His father says he is ‘a little bit of a rascal’ — and these adorable new portraits of Prince George, now 17 months old, show plenty of mischief in his huge brown eyes. Here, Alison Boshoff reveals what the photos tell us about his development. THE COURAGEOUS CAMERAMAN . When the first informal picture of George was taken by Kate’s father, Michael Middleton, it was clear the Prince would not soon be sitting through any formal photoshoots with strange (if highly skilled) photographers. This time the pictures were taken by a member of the couple’s staff, rather than an outside professional, reflecting the deep trust the couple have for their inner circle of advisers. The chosen cameraman was Edward Lane Fox, Prince Harry’s private secretary, who has previously worked as a freelance photographer. He joined the household office of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry at Kensington Palace in 2013. He previously served in Bosnia and Iraq in the Army, with the Blues and Royals, and was a captain. After leaving the military, he took a Masters degree at the London College of Printing in Documentary Photography and Photojournalism. He joined the Palace after getting to know Harry through a mutual involvement in the Sentebale charity. The choice of photographer appears to have paid off — the photos are relaxed and full of character, reflecting the fact they were taken by someone George already knows. BRAVING THE COLD . The pictures were taken in a courtyard at Kensington Palace, which is the London base of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, where they live in the apartments previously used by Princess Margaret. That this location was chosen reflects the way in which Kate and William cherish their home life, and the great fun and freedom Prince George is afforded in the private grounds. Though the pictures were taken at the end of November, George is in shorts with bare legs — indicating not just the unseasonal warm temperatures this year but his love of the outdoors. He might be a prince, but he is hardy, too. PARTING BREAKS WITH TRADITION . Not only are his lovely golden locks catching attention here — so, too, is the strong comb-over, and its distinct direction. For while George’s hair is parted on the right, traditionally men part theirs on the left and women on the right. Although the distinction is now largely considered outmoded, there is a body of thought that holds that right-hand partings on men do not look good — particularly on would-be leaders. The chosen cameraman was Edward Lane Fox, Prince Harry’s private secretary, who has previously worked as a freelance photographer (left) and George breaks tradition with the direction of his parting (right) Some believe this was even a factor in the U.S. presidential election in 2000 — George W. Bush parted his hair on the left, making him appear stronger and more suited to be President than his opponent Al Gore, who parted his hair on the right. The change is perhaps most obvious in the original Superman films, where Christopher Reeve parted his hair on the right when he was Clark Kent and on the left when he was Superman. And the left-sided parting certainly seems to have worked out for two other advocates — Prince William and Prince Harry, when they were children. Some have suspected the influence here of George’s Spanish nanny Maria Teresa Turrion Borrallo, hired earlier this year. In fact, the parting decision is due to George’s natural hair pattern, says leading hairdresser Mathew Alexander. ‘This is an adorable haircut and complements his look, which is very retro, Forties and a bit Christopher Robin. It is also very on trend with the sweep over,’ says Alexander. George is cuddled by his mother, the Duchess of Cambridge (left) and his father Prince William, right . ‘I can see a little cowlick — a swirling section at odds with the rest of the hair — and that is dictating where the hair is parted. ‘Any good hairdresser goes by looking at your crown and any cowlicks to see where you hair parts naturally.’ But his current style and colour is not an indicator of what it will be in adulthood, says hairdresser Beverly Cobella — in fact, he may end up dark like his mother. ‘You can expect his hair to change completely in colour and texture between the ages of five and seven, and then again in his teens,’ she says. ‘We all wonder whether there will be baldness, as there is plenty on the Windsor side, but trichologists advise looking at the mother’s father to see what will happen, and Michael Middleton has a full head of hair.’ LOOK WHO’S TEETHING . Cheeks as pink as a blushing milkmaid and even a visibly swollen cheek on one side — it certainly looks as if poor Prince George is teething at the moment. We have already seen his front teeth make an appearance, and now it looks as if his molars are coming through, too, hence the swelling. He is entirely on schedule here — experts say the first teeth appear around the six-month mark with a full set of milk teeth in place after about two years. THE PRO’S VERDICT . ‘This is a successful set of pictures which are technically accomplished,’ says professional photographer Andrew Parsons. ‘The lighting is flat, the background is neutral, the exposure is correct. You can tell they have been done by someone with professional experience but what is nice is that you can also see they have been taken by someone the boy is comfortable with. There is a naturalness about them.’ For while George might appear naturally photogenic, it is a huge challenge to take good, candid portraits of children. ‘They have a short attention span and it shows if they are not happy,’ says Parsons, co-founder of the i-Images picture agency, which photographed George on the Down Under tour. ‘It can be very hard to get children to smile, and some hate having their pictures taken so cry.’ George’s happy demeanour suggests his parents or nanny were present, says Parsons. ‘He is probably looking at them,’ he says. ‘But it would be nice if he was looking at the camera in more than just the one shot. ‘Yet the fact his parents have chosen this set of pictures, with quirky images, says a lot about them and their love of his character.’","Adorable new portraits of Prince George were taken by Edward Lane Fox .

"David Moyes drew his first Basque derby 1-1 in a hard-fought game at Anoeta. He saw his Real Sociedad take a third minute lead through top scorer Carlos Vela but they were pegged back in the second half and despite facing 10 men for the last 10 minutes had to settle for a point. The start could not have been better for Moyes . He has been urging his full-backs to overlap even giving them the example of Leighton Baines to follow and when the goal came on three minutes it was a run from right-back Carlos Martinez that started the move. He overlapped down the right and crossed for Alfred Finnbogason. The Icelandic striker made poor contact with his header but when the ball ran to the other flank Chory Castro jinked to the byline and crossed for Carlos Vela to head past Gorka Iraizoz. Team-mates rush to congratulate Carlos Vela after the Mexican forward put Real Sociedad in the lead . Oscar de Marcos equalised for Athletic Bilbao in the second-half on Sunday night . David Moyes issues instructions to Alfred Finnbogason during the game at Anoeta . REAL SOCIEDAD: Zubikarai, Carlos, Ansotegi, Iñigo, De la Bella, Markel, Granero (Zurutuza 64), Castro (Canales 64) Chory, Vela, Finnbogason . Subs not used: Rulli, Ruben Pardo, Izeta, Gaztanaga, Hervias . Scorer: Vela 3 . ATHLETIC BILBAO: Iraizoz, De Marcos, Balenziaga, San José, Laporte, Iturraspe, M.Rico, Unai (Viguera 60), Susaeta (Gurpegi 81), Aduriz, Muniain (Gomez 78) Subs not used: Urkiaga, Martinez, Buisan, Hierro . Booked: San Jose . Sent off: Laporte . Scorer: De Marcos 61 . Athletic could have doubled their lead on 11 mintues when Iñigo Martinez headed Xabi Prieto corner just wide. Athletic were struggling to contend with Carlos Vela and former Liverpool defender Mikel San Jose was booked for clattering the Mexican striker. Vela was thrown up in the air again from a challenge with Mikel Balenziaga. He was a constant threat and had he, and not his strike partner Finnbogason, been on the end of Xabi Prieto’s cross moments later it would have been 2-0. The Icelandic is completely lacking in confidence and headed woefully wide. Real Sociedad were not having it all their own way and Aritz Aduriz twice tested Eñaut Zubikarai. He also got down well to his right to save Susaeta free-kick but Athletic remained in the ascendancy until half time. Chory Castro shot was saved by Iraizoz and Vela had the whole of the Anoteta on their feet with a mazy run and shot that deserved a goal. Athletic took the game to the home side in the second half but Real Sociedad were able to break quickly with the pass of Castro. He was fed by Xabi Prieto but when the cross came in again Finnbogason was unable to finish. There was always a good chance that they were going to pay for such sloppy finishing and on the hour the equalizer came. Markel Susaeta sent a curling cross to the back post and right back Oscar de Marcos arrived with perfect timing and conviction to volley past Zubikarai. Esteban Granero fights for the ball with opposing striker Aritz Aduriz at Anoeta . Markel Bergara attempts to tackle Athletic Bilbao youngster Iker Muniain on Sunday night . La Real had not been the same side in the second side. Susaeta had time to measure his cross and De Marcos’ energy to meet the centre from his full-back position ahead of Real Sociedad full back Alberto de la Bella was also telling. Moyes must have feared total capitulation just a week after his team conceded four in the second half against Villarreal but they were up against ten men from 79 minutes onwards when Athletic Bilbao centre-back Aymeric Laporte was sent off for a second yellow card. He elbowed Xabi Prieto as the both jumped for a header and deserved to go. Real Sociedad almost took immediate advantage when a run from Castro forced a free-kick on the edge of the area and substitute Sergio Canales thundered it on to the bar. There was still time for Canales to squander another chance with a shot well saved by Iraizoz. Derby games were never kind to Moyes in England. He lost his first one as Manchester United manager 4-1. This was an improvement on that – and against Champions League opponents – but he he will know with better finishing it could have been even better.

"Southampton full back Nathaniel Clyne believe's he has 'definitely' got the quality to play for England. The 23-year-old has been ever-present in Saints' charge to second place in the Barclays Premier League, making the right back shirt his own following Calum Chambers' move to Arsenal. He was rewarded with a first international call-up for last month's Euro 2016 double header against San Marino and Estonia but was an unused substitute in both games. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Sportsmail's  Big Match Stats: Hull  vs Southampton . Nathaniel Clyne beats Mohamed Diame for pace before whipping in a cross against Hull on Saturday . 'It's always good to play for your country. If you play well then you get picked up,' he said. 'I think I've got the ability to play for my country, definitely. I'm playing with lots of confidence. 'Hopefully I can get called up again and receive my first cap.' Southampton needed a mis-hit clearance from Hull's third-choice goalkeeper Eldin Jakupovic and wonderful 40-yard strike from Victor Wanyama to see off Hull on Saturday, but their winning habit is becoming unshakeable. When previous boss Mauricio Pochettino left for Tottenham in the summer and the likes of Luke Shaw, Adam Lallana, Rickie Lambert and Dejan Lovren followed him out of the door, a season of struggle was widely predicted. England manager Roy Hodgson was in attendance to see Southampton duo Fraser Forster and Clyne . Yet they have now won 10 of their last 11 matches in all competitions, with the meanest defence in the top flight and only Chelsea above them. Unsurprisingly, spirits are high. 'We keep winning and getting clean sheets, hopefully we can keep up our run of form and see where we go with it,' said Clyne. 'A few of the lads are talking about the Europa League, Europe and stuff. But we've just got to keep pushing and hopefully the results will take care of themselves.' Hull, meanwhile, were unable to build on battling draws at Arsenal and Liverpool in their previous two matches. The young full-back has been one of Southampton's most impressive performers this season . Despite the slender scoreline, Southampton were clearly the better side and could have added as many as three to their tally with better finishing. Nevertheless, they would be forgiven for wondering what might have been had Jakupovic, starting in the Premier League for only the third time with Allan McGregor and Steve Harper injured, not erred. He sent the ball straight to Wanyama when attempting to clear, leaving himself badly out of position as the ball sailed back into his net. But midfielder Stephen Quinn insists the Swiss must put the incident behind him as soon as possible. Clyne was called up to train with the national squad but didn't make an actual appearance . 'It's been difficult for Eldin, he's been a long time out as second or third choice keeper and he came in and did ever so well at Liverpool last week,' said Quinn. 'He's a good keeper, but he made a simple mistake and a lot of the time you can get away with those. 'I'm sure he will be dejected but he's got to be a man about it and get his head up because it looks like he'll be starting again next week. 'You can't dwell on it. He has to look to the next game and try to improve.'","Southampton beat Hull 1-0 to keep pace with Chelsea in Premier League .

"Reduced rates: Terrorism Risk Insurance Act allows Federal Government to split the cost of insurance with the organizers of large events . There's a chance the Super Bowl won't be played this year because insurance used to cover the game is about to expire. It all depends on whether or not Congress renews the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act, however without any insurance, the game will almost certainly have to be cancelled. Terrorism insurance used to be widely available to U.S. businesses including the organizers of sporting events. TRIA was signed into law in 2002 in the aftermath of the 9/11 terrorist attacks, establishing a risk-sharing partnership between the federal government and the insurance industry. Without federal support, most insurers had been unwilling to offer coverage. The act helps insure against terror attacks, and in recent weeks has been named a major concern for the organizers. The simplest way to understand the act is to know that it helps backstop private insurers who insure against damages from terrorism, making the rates lower for those who buy the insurance. Although TRIA was renewed in 2005 and in 2007, it is set to expire on December 31 unless Congress renews it. With just two weeks to go before the deadline, the clock is ticking. Without insurance, a high-risk event like the Super Bowl cannot go on. Scroll down for video . The play or not to play? The Terrorism Risk Insurance Act is due to expire at the end of 2014 meaning the game may have to called off because the game will not be insured against acts of terrorism . The NFL has joined other professional sports leagues and 80 business groups to form the Coalition to Insurance Against Terrorism (CIAT) to urge Congress to fund the reauthorization of TRIA. If TRIA is not renewed, insurers will have the right to cancel terrorism insurance policies after January 1. Insurers are sometimes likely to cancel policies out of fear of insolvency, should another massive terrorist attack occur without government assistance. Prior to 9/11, insurers included terrorism coverage in all commercial policies without charging for it. The risk from terrorism was low and below their threshold level of concern. However, after shelling out $44 billion in claims for 9/1, insurers began to exclude terrorism from commercial policies. The TRIA act has to be reauthorized during the next two weeks otherwise insurers will have the right to cancel terrorism insurance policies after January 1st, putting the February 1st game in jeopardy.","Before 9/11 coverage for terror attacks was included for free on insurance policies .

"Police in New York are monitoring a terrorist attack in Syndey, Australia, in which as many as 20 people have been taken hostage. An armed siege is developing after either one of two gunmen marched into a Lindt cafe in the center of the city and forced sobbing hostages against the window. Australian police have sealed off the surrounding streets amid fears the attacker or attackers have a shotgun and explosives. In light of the attack, the NYPD said they are 'aware of what's happening in Australia', and later added: 'We are monitoring the situation in Sydney.' The U.S. government has also evacuated its consulate in Sydney, which is very close to the scene of the confrontation. Scroll down for video . Terrorists were today holding hostages in an armed siege in a cafe in Sydney where an extremist flag was held up in the window . Terrified customers and employees were among those standing with their hands against the window at the Lindt cafe in Sydney . A spokesman confirmed the evacuation. The consulate also issued an emergency warning to U.S. citizens in Sydney, urging them to 'maintain a high level of vigilance and take appropriate steps to enhance your personal security'. President Obama has also been briefed on the situation by a homeland security and counter-terrorism adviser. ISIS, the terror organization to which the hostage-takers are believed to be linked, routinely encourage their supporters to make small-scale 'lone wolf' attacks to be made against the West, particularly in the United States. The FBI recently warned military personnel to disguise their presence on social media and suppress identifying information in case they become targets in a surprise attack. The Sydney incident began just hours after a 25-year-old suspect was arrested in a terror raid in Sydney. Officials have also evacuated the Sydney Opera House after reports of a suspicious device. Martin Place has been shut down and scores of police are surrounding the building after the alarm was raised about 9.45am. Hostages: People could be seen with their hands pressed against the window of the Lindt cafe in Sydney . Martin Place has been shut down and scores of police are surrounding the building after the alarm was raised about 9.45am . Journalist Chris Kenny, who was in the shop about 20 minutes before the siege began, said he understood the automatic glass sliding doors had been disabled. 'I did speak to a couple of people who saw a bit more of this unfold than I did,' he said. 'One woman said she tried to go into the shop just after I came out with my takeaway coffee but the doors wouldn't open. 'So obviously whoever is doing this has disabled the automatic glass sliding doors to stop anyone else going in and she said immediately she could see there was a weapon. 'The woman was quite frantic but very clear what she was telling (the police). 'I know the faces of the people who are sitting there enjoying a morning coffee.' It is unclear how many people are involved in the siege in a Lindt cafe in Martin Place but people could be seen with their hands pressed against the windows . 'Aware': New York police said they are monitoring the hostage situation to see whether any action needs to be taken in the city . Patrols: ISIS extremists often urge their supporters in the West to make 'lone wolf' attacks . The Seven Network newsroom, which is in a building opposite the cafe, has been evacuated. Other buildings in Martin Place, including the nearby Westpac building, have been cleared. 'We're just recommending no one go near Martin Place at the moment,' a New South Wales Police spokeswoman said. Martin Place train station has been closed and public buses are being turned away. A staff member at the Reserve Bank told Daily Mail Australia they were unable to be evacuated because Martin Place had been closed. Staff have been told to move away from the windows. Another woman who works in the government building opposite the cafe tried to call her her office to say she couldn't get past cordons and all the phone lines were down. It was alleged that Omarjan Azari, the 22-year-old Sydney man arrested on terrorism charges in September, was planning a public beheading in Martin Place. NSW Police are telling people to stay away from the area as the train station in Martin place has been closed . Armed NSW police officers surrounded the busy cafe following reports of armed gunmen inside . The alleged terror plot, mentioned in a conversation between Australian terrorism recruiter in Syria, Mohammad Ali Barylei and Azari, involved selecting a member of the public at random, beheading them and then covering their body in a flag. The whole incident was going to be filmed, and then used as propaganda for the ISIS cause. Federal prosecutors said the alleged terror plot was 'clearly designed to shock, horror and terrify the community' Police Prosecutor Michael Allnutt said that Azari had made a threat which involved a 'random selection of persons to execute' during a telephone conversation with Baryalei. Azari was arrested on September 18 and charged with preparing for an act of terrorism. He is due in court this week for a bail application. The flag being held up in the window of the cafe is believed to be a Shahada flag, which is used by the group Jabhat al Nusra. At least two gunmen are involved in the siege but dozens of armed police have sealed off the streets surrounding the site . Jabhat al Nusra was formed in January 2012, in the Syrian civil war to fight the Syrian government forces. Jabhat al Nusra, or JN, aims to overthrow the Assad regime and replace it with a Sunni Islamic state. Although the group is affiliated with al-Qaeda, Jabhat al-Nusra does not emphasize Western targets or global jihad, focusing instead on the 'near enemy' of the Syrian state. Martin Place is one of Sydney's busiest streets and is at the center of the CBD. The Lindt cafe where the hostages are being held specializes in chocolate and has a number of branches across the city.

"Southampton’s extraordinary start to the season, maintained with a brilliant opportunist’s goal from Victor Wanyama at the KC Stadium, has been built on the best defensive record in the country. The Saints have kept six clean sheets in 10 Premier League matches and conceded just five goals, two of them at Liverpool in the first match Ronald Koeman’s side played together. Nathaniel Clyne is a key component of the division’s best back line and the 23-year-old right-back sees no reason why this dream season cannot continue — for club and country. Nathaniel Clyne has been in impressive form for high-flying Southampton so far this season . Victor Wanyama's first-time effort from 40 yards out gave Southampton an early lead at the KC Stadium . ‘I think I’ve got the ability to play for my country. Hopefully I can get the call-up next time,’ he said. England manager Roy Hodgson was in the stands as Clyne gave another fine attacking full-back display at the KC Stadium. Southampton's five goals conceded is half the next lowest number in the Premier League, and the lowest per game in all of English football.
