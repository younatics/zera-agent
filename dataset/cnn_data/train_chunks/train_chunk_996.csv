"A mother has condemned her son's school's 'over the top' rules on hairstyles after her 12-year-old was put in isolation because he had a wrestling logo shaved into his head. Aidan Fradley was barred from conventional lessons after he had the letters 'TNA' shaved into his hair ahead of a trip to London to watch Total Nonstop Action Wrestling at Wembley Arena. His mother Sophie Turkentine, 33, had initially vowed to keep Aidan out of Ramsey Academy, in Halstead, Essex, until after half term. Anger: Sophie Turkentine, 33, has labelled her son's school 'over the top' after 12-year-old Aidan Fradley was put in isolation because he had a wrestling logo shaved into his head . Fan: Aidan was barred from conventional lessons after he had the letters 'TNA' shaved into his hair ahead of a trip to London to watch Total Nonstop Action Wrestling at Wembley Arena . However, she has since reluctantly had the sides of her son's head shaved, and he has now returned to class. 'He went into school on Monday to literally get put straight into isolation,' she said. 'I’m absolutely fuming, which is why I went to pick him up. I don’t see how it affects anything he’s doing in school. 'It’s not like it’s outrageously blue or pink. It’s just three letters. I think it’s nice to be original.' The mother-of-five also claimed there was no consistency and she regularly sees girls with short skirts, wearing lots of jewellery and make-up.

She added: 'I knew the school would have something to say, but I didn’t think they’d be anything like they have. I think it’s really over the top.' Deputy headteacher Calum Leys said: 'At the Ramsey Academy it is our aim for students to develop a sense of pride in their work, behaviour and dress. As part of this we consider uniform to be important and students are expected to be correctly dressed at all times . 'We are incredibly proud of our achievements in this regard over the last 18 months and we regularly receive praise from the community in relation to the improved conduct and appearance of our students. 'While we do not believe it is appropriate to comment upon individual students, the academy does have clear expectations regarding dress. One of these is extreme hairstyles, which will not be permitted. 'Our approach in this situation are, we believe, consistent with other secondary schools.'

"When Mario Testino compared Cara Delevingne to Kate Moss, it is unlikely he was thinking of the picture on this picture. Nonetheless, the 20-year-old catwalk sensation showed she can match the supermodel in more ways than one. On a mammoth night of 12 hours of partying she managed to take in four top venues and hook up with a string of stars. Long night: Cara Delevingne pictured at 5am on Tuesday after 12 hours or partying . It was the kind of effort Miss Moss would have been proud of and ended in true style – with Miss Delevingne on her bottom after stumbling out of a house party at 5am yesterday. The young model’s marathon began shortly after her second appearance of the day at London Fashion Week – at the Burberry show at 4pm. By 6.30pm, casually dressed in a hoody and skinny trousers, she and friend Georgia May Jagger, daughter of Sir Mick, had turned up at East London pub The Cockpit, where they stayed for an hour and a half. Miss Delevingne then moved on to the War Child Brit Awards concert with Muse at the O2 Shepherd’s Bush Empire where she bumped into One Direction star Harry Styles, whom she is rumoured to have once dated, singer Rita Ora and pop star Will.I.Am. From there, she popped in to the Dazed and Confused party at the Café Royal at around 11.30pm, where she chatted with Kate Moss’s husband Jamie Hince before heading to a bash at the West London home of football agent Dave Gardner. At 4pm on Monday Delevingne had looked her model best on the catwalk for Burberry before heading out with friend Georgia May Jagger . It was as she left there, alone, that . she lost her footing. By the time she eventually made it home, she is . thought to have been up for the best part of 24 hours. It was a night out even Miss Moss . would have been proud of. Memorably, her wilder outings have included . planning four parties spanning 34 hours to mark her 34th birthday - . although she called it a day after 18 hours. But while Miss Delevingne and Miss Moss, now 39, both enjoy a good night out, in other ways they could not be more different. The former was raised in a Belgravia . mansion, is granddaughter of Sir Jocelyn Stevens, the former boss of . English Heritage, and the Delevingne family are well-established members . of London’s society scene. Her grandmother was a lady-in-waiting to . Princess Margaret, her mother Pandora was a society beauty during the . 1980s who counts the Duchess of York as one of her close friends, and . her godmother is Joan Collins. It is all rather a far cry from the humbler origins of Croydon-born Miss Moss, who has been Britain’s top model since the 1990s. At 9pm she was pictured at the War Child Brit Awards concert with singer Rita Ora . At 12.30am Cara and friends chat to Harry Styles and Jamie Hince . Aside from their waif like frames, it . was a similarity in the two’s energy, attitude and personality which . prompted celebrated photographer Mario Testino to label Miss Delevingne . ‘the new Kate Moss’. Testino labelled Miss Delevingne ‘the new Kate Moss’ after recognising a similarity in the energy and attitude of the pair. In response, the younger model has said: ‘It’s crazy to even be considered in the same calibre as Kate, it’s a huge compliment but scary even to be mentioned in the same breath.’ Either way, Testino was clearly on to something. But no one can say 2012 was not a brilliant year for her. In addition to earning Testino’s praise, she won the Model of the Year award at the British Fashion Awards and starred in the famous Burberry advertising campaign alongside Romeo Beckham for which she earned £570,000. She has also appeared on the cover of fashion magazine Vogue. She takes a stumbble on the stairs as she leaves David Gardner's house party . The model tries to style it out as she trips on the staircase . Miss Delevingne, who is now said to be moving into a north London flat recently bought by her best friend Miss Jagger, has struck up a relationship with 18-year-old singing sensation Jake Bugg, who grew up on a tough Nottingham council estate. The singer-songwriter, who has been compared to Bob Dylan, attended the Burberry catwalk show on Monday afternoon. The pair have already been on a string of dates since meeting at the beginning of last month when the singer-songwriter performed at an event hosted by Burberry. Still feeling sleepy? Cara carries an array of pillows  as she returns home . Speaking about Miss Delevingne’s relationship with the musician, her mother said: ‘I don’t think it’s anything serious at the moment. But she has told me about Jake and she says she thinks “he’s cute”. ‘I think they have been on a couple of dates together. I haven’t met him yet although I’m looking forward to meeting him. I think it is very early days.’","Cara Delevingne packed in four top venues on Monday night .

"Dead: Itzcoatl Ocampo, 25, pictured, was found in his single-man cell at Central Jail in Santa Ana Wednesday and died in hospital Thursday . A former Marine charged with murder . in the deaths of four homeless men and two others died Thursday at a . California hospital, a day after falling ill in his jail cell, . authorities said. Itzcoatl . Ocampo, 25, was found in his single-man cell at Central Jail in Santa . Ana Wednesday and taken to a hospital, said Orange County sheriff's Lt. Jeff Hallock. He was pronounced dead at about 1:30 p.m. Thursday. No . cause of death was immediately given, and officials said an autopsy . will be performed in the coming days. The Orange County district . attorney's office will investigate the death. Prosecutors were seeking the death penalty against Ocampo. His trial was set for May 2014. They . alleged that the native of Mexico stabbed four homeless men in what . they called a serial thrill-kill spree in late 2011 and early 2012. Ocampo . targeted his homeless victims because they were vulnerable and because . he felt they were a blight to the community, authorities said. Ocampo, . who was discharged from the Marines in 2010, was also facing murder . charges in the deaths of a school friend's mother and brother in October . 2011. He . told investigators he planned to kill 16 people to follow in the . footsteps of University of Texas tower killer Charles Whitman, another . former Marine. Ocampo said . he had no history of psychological problems and felt the need to kill . after he was confined to driving a water truck and a dirt truck on a . military base in Iraq. The 25-year-old served an eight-month deployment in Iraq in 2008. Service: A relative holds a photograph of Itzcoatl posing proudly in his Marines uniform. He was said to have become paranoid and delusional after his deployment . Mystery: No cause of death was immediately given, and officials said an autopsy will be performed on the 25-year-old, pictured, in the coming days . According to secret grand jury testimony, Ocampo reportedly joined the Marine Corps because 'he needed to kill.' The homeless murders took place over a three-week period starting in December 2011. Ocampo was arrested following the fourth attack, which occurred outside a Carl's Jr. restaurant in Anaheim on January 13, 2012. The . mother and son he was accused of slaying in Yorba Linda in October 2011 . were identified as his friend's mother 53-year-old Raquel Estrada and . brother 34-year-old son Juan Herrera. When he was arrested he told investigators he targeted homeless people in part because they were vulnerable, and that he believed he has a 'killer gene'. The victims: (L-R) James . McGillivray was stabbed outside a shopping centre on December 20; Lloyd . Middaugh was found stabbed on a riverbed on December 28; and Paulus . Cornelius Smit was found stabbed outside a library on December 30 . Sad: The fourth victim, John Berry, 64, was killed on January 13, 2012 in Anaheim, California . Authorities said the killings were . carried out with a roughly seven-inch military-style blade and that he . terrorized Orange County's homeless community. Ocampo had pleaded not . guilty to the charges. Ocampo told investigators he started to . kill homeless men because they were 'available and vulnerable' and . continued stabbing his victims even after believing they were dead, . according to the transcript. Ocampo said he looked at Penthouse magazine before the attacks 'to pump himself up,' Wyatt said. 'He . seemed to get excited when he was talking about the actual kill,' Wyatt . testified. 'So, I asked him if he was aroused by the act of killing.' Ocampo at first questioned the word arousal, according to the transcript, but then added, 'my balls felt like they were going to explode, and I knew that I had the killer gene.' Murder weapon: Orange County District Attorney Tony Rackauckas holds up picture of a knife similar to the one he accused of being used by Itzcoatl Ocampo in the killings . Normal young man: Itzcoatl Ocampo's family released these images of the young man, showing him in happier times . Ocampo was arrested in January 2012 . after a witness helped chase down a suspect following the stabbing of a . fourth homeless victim outside a fast-foot restaurant in Anaheim, about . 26 miles southeast of Los Angeles. Ocampo was initially charged with the . four murders and prosecutors later added charges for the Yorba Linda . killings. Detectives said at the time they saw similarities in the cases of the Yorba Linda deaths and the stabbings of four homeless men. Detectives . focused on the severity of the attacks, the number and the type of . wounds, and the proximity of Ocampo's home to the Yorba Linda killings, . the Orange County Register reported. Locations: Police in Orange County, California say Ocampo was responsible for four killings since December 2011 . Worried: Refugio Ocampo, the father of the 23-year-old who is the prime suspect in the killings, is himself homeless and said the Iraq war killed the man his son used to be . The homeless men were identified as: . James Patrick McGillivray, 53, who was stabbed December 20 near a . shopping center in Placentia; Lloyd Middaugh, 42, who was found December . 28 near a riverbed trail in Anaheim; Paulus Smit, 57, who was stabbed . to death outside a Yorba Linda library on December 30; and John Berry, . 64, who was stabbed to death on the day Ocampo was arrested. Each of the four men was stabbed more . than 40 times with a weapon believed to be a 7-inch fixed-blade . military-type knife, authorities said. Before Ocampo's arrest, police had fanned out across the county better known as the home to Disneyland and multi-million dollar beachfront homes to urge the homeless to be careful and seek shelter indoors. Veterans Affairs officials said the high-profile violence painted an inaccurate picture of returning veterans. His father, Refugio Ocampo, said his son came back from his deployment a changed man. He said his son expressed disillusionment and became ever darker as he struggled to find his way.","Itzcoatl Ocampo, 25, was found in his single-man cell at Central Jail in Santa Ana, California, Wednesday .

"'Shell of a man': Former Deputy Chief Constable David Ainsworth was haunted by the accusations . A police chief committed suicide while being investigated over allegations he sexually harrased female colleagues, a coroner has ruled. Deputy Chief Constable David Ainsworth, 49, hanged himself in his garage fearing he would 'lose everything' because of the misconduct inquiry. A total of 13 staff - mainly women -  from Wiltshire Police made 27 allegations about his alleged untoward behaviour. The £110,000-a-year officer - who . dreamed of leading his force and becoming ‘Sir David’ - allegedly told a . woman ‘nice buttons’ while looking at her shirt, in one of the claims. Shortly before his death he told told a psychologist that it had dawned on him how his behaviour had upset people. However, recording a verdict of suicide, Wiltshire Coroner David Ridley accepted that there was nothing to indicate police and health professionals should have known that . there was an immediate risk to his life. Father-of-four Mr Ainsworth - known as . 'The Brain' because of his strong intellect - did not face any criminal . charges but there was a possibility he may have faced a police . disciplinary panel. After the verdict, Chris Hoare, . Wiltshire Police Authority Chairman, confirmed there were up to 13 . potential victims of DCC Ainsworth and the claims were still being . looked into. He said: 'Further to the coroner’s . verdict today, our sincere and heartfelt thoughts and sympathies are . with David’s family, partner Joanna and friends in these tragic . circumstances. 'This has been an exceptionally . difficult period for all concerned, not only for David’s family, partner . and friends, but also for many within our organisation. 'We note that the coroner recognised . that we had put in place comprehensive welfare arrangements which . focussed on David’s needs. Tragic: David Ainsworth was found at his home in Potterne, Wilts., by girlfriend Jo Howes . 'A good employer has a duty of care to . all its employees. They need to feel able to raise concerns - and know . they will be dealt with. 'Thirteen members of staff raised a . total of 26 individual allegations which were being investigated by an . outside force at the time of David Ainsworth’s tragic death. 'The staff and managers who came forward did so bravely, rightly and properly. They will continue to receive our full support.' Among the claims were allegations that . Deputy Chief Con. Ainsworth looked at a woman work colleague wearing a . tailored blouse and remarked 'nice buttons'. The inquest earlier heard from his estranged . wife, Emma Ainsworth, who said the man she knew had 'become a shell of . his former self?' after the allegations had emerged. She said: 'David was just a shell,' she told the coroner after recalling seeing Mr Ainsworth in the weeks leading to his death. 'The children were visibly shocked. They didn’t know what to say to him. 'He looked physically ill. He looked like he should be in hospital. The children said he couldn’t even work his mobile phone.' She told the inquest in Trowbridge, . Wilts., that the effect the allegations had on him was a far cry from . the man who dreamed of having one of the top jobs in the police force. 'His ultimate goal was to be Chief Constable,” said Mrs Ainsworth, who lives in Coxheath, Kent. 'His dream was to become ""Sir David"". He was extremely intelligent and would often leave people unable to keep up with him.' He had joined the Wiltshire force in . 2008 and had previously worked for 22 years with Kent Police. He was the . Association of Chief Police Officers’ spokesman on vehicle crime. He became depressed and sought treatment in January 2011. Miss Howes sobbed as she told how she found his body on March 22 last year. ‘He felt abandoned by a police service he devoted his life to,’ she added. Verdict: suicide.","Deputy Chief Constable David Ainsworth was found at his home by girlfriend Joanna Howes .

"Chinese authorities have built a 'baby abandonment' building where parents can anonymously leave their unwanted children. The building, located in Nanjing, eastern China, will provide a safe place for parents to leave their children - who will then be cared for at a nearby welfare home, according to reports. The space - coined a 'baby box' by local media - will be electronically monitored so that when a baby is left an alarm will go off. 'Baby box': The Chinese Authorities have built a baby abandonment centre in the hope it will stop parents leaving unwanted children to die . Staff the nearby Nanjing Welfare Home - located five minutes away - will then come to collect the child. The building is air-conditioned and has humidity monitors. It includes an incubator, a bed and a thermometer. There will be no CCTV - so the parents will be totally anonymous, a report on Shanghaiist has claimed. Staff at the Nanjing Welfare Home hope the building will stop parents from leaving their children in parks or on the streets - where they often freeze to death. 'For the sake of their lives': Zhu Hong from the Nanjing Welfare Home said the box is air-conditioned with a bed and a incubator . Many feel forced to leave their children due to the government's population control one child policy - introduced in 1979. The news come as the city of Shenzhen has reportedly applied to the Guangdong provincial authorities to pilot such a facility next year. Critics of the scheme have said it will encourage irresponsible parents to abandon their offspring. Zhu Hong, the centre's spokesman said: 'We do this for the sake of the babies lives. 'The parents might have to abandon them for unthinkable reasons. But the children are innocent and need to be protected.' So far this year the home has received 160 babies. In August, a horrific image of a newborn baby drowned in a river caused outrage in China after it emerged on local social networking sites. The picture - taken from a river bank in south east China - apparently shows a dead infant wearing a romper suit and a nappy several days after the newborn had been abandoned in the water. The photo has appalled Chinese internet users who have set up an online search for clues to the baby's identity. Video source iFeng .

China has a one-baby policy, introduced in 1979 to keep the country's population under control, which restricts urban couples to having just one child. Despite egalitarian policies in China, many families hope to have a son to provide for them in their old age. As a result the country has a higher rate of female infanticide and lower ration of female to male births.","Nanjing Welfare Home built box for parents to leave unwanted children .

"Unemployed benefit claimants will be forced to carry out unpaid work if they refuse to turn up for two interviews or drop out of work programmes. Under the ‘two strikes and you are out’ policy, the jobless will be told to work unpaid for up to 30 hours a week or they will be stripped of their benefits. Sources say the results of a trial scheme are so striking that ministers are rolling it out nationwide this month in a programme hitting up to 50,000 unemployed. People queue outside a Job Centre in Bristol. If a benefit claimant fail to turn up to two interviews they will be forced to take part in the programme to get them used to working nine to five . Job Centre staff have been given the power to force anyone claiming out-of-work benefits to take part in ‘mandatory work activity’ - unpaid posts designed to get them used to working from nine to five. Those who appear unwilling to look for work can be referred to the scheme at any stage, even on the first day of their claim. The placements are typically with charities or involve some kind of community service, such as helping to maintain parks, working in a local sports club or doing maintenance work for housing residents. Those who refuse to take part, or agree but then fail to turn up, have their £67.50-a-week unemployment benefit stopped for a minimum of three months. Pilots have found that half of those claiming unemployment benefits would prefer to lose their handouts than do a stint of unpaid work. Figures show that 20 per cent of those ordered to take part in four-week community projects stop claiming immediately and another 30 per cent are stripped of their benefits when they fail to turn up. Officials suspect many of those who stop claiming benefits are working in the black economy and would rather lose their welfare than give up their undeclared earnings. Chris Grayling, Minister for Employment, will be taking the policy nationwide later this month . The scheme, which is delivered by a range of organisations from the private, voluntary and third sector, is already underway in London, the East and Yorkshire & the Humber. In a major expansion of the scheme, it will now be rolled out throughout the country. It will cost around £5million because officials have to arrange work placements and monitor claimants’ attendance. However, ministers believe it will produce big savings to Britain’s £100billion benefits bill in the long term. The mandatory work activity scheme is separate to the unpaid work experience for private firms, which critics have attacked as ‘slave labour’. About 18,000 people a year are believed to be part-taking in the 'mandatory work activity'-scheme. Employment minister Chris Grayling, who will be unveiling the policy later this week, wants to double this figure. Grayling said: ‘If Jobcentre Plus advisers believe a jobseeker would benefit from getting some experience of the work environment they can now refer them onto a work activity placement. 'These placements are all about getting people into a working routine if they need an additional push to get into employment. ‘This is beneficial to some jobseekers as it will allow them to develop more of a ""work orientated mindset"" but it also makes them a much more appealing prospect for an employer looking to fill a vacancy, and more confident when they enter the workplace. 'We are determined to break the habit of worklessness and get those who can work into jobs.’","Unpaid posts have been designed to get unemployed used to nine-to-five work .

"Speaking ahead of her AW13 collection show at London Fashion Week today, Vivienne Westwood called on the Duchess of . Cambridge to stop buying so many clothes and make more . of an effort to be green. The style icon, who showed a 'quality over quantity' collection of structured, wearable pieces, knows a thing or two about the subject - and she's not shy of sharing her opinions. Before her London Fashion Week . showcase at the Saatchi Gallery today, Dame Vivienne said that because Kate . goes to so much effort to get an outfit that looks good, she should . wear it more often. Scroll down for video . Eco warrior: 'You don't have to have a red outfit one day and something the same in blue the next' The designer, who is an ardent environmental campaigner, has now voiced her disapproval of Kate's burgeoning wardrobe, arguing that repeatedly wearing the same pieces is better for the planet and would send a positive message. She said: 'I don't have any advice for her, [although] I think it would be great if she wore the same clothes over . and again, because that's very good for the environment and it would . send out a very nice message. 'If you're going to all that trouble to get an outfit that suits you, then you should keep on wearing it. 'I mean you don't have to have a red outfit one day and then something almost the same in blue the next.' This isn't the first time Dame Vivienne has complained about the Duchess of Cambridge's sartorial choices. In 2011, she complained about the Duchess' use of eyeliner in the Sunday Times . Magazine. 'I think she's got a problem with eye make-up,' the designer griped. 'The . sharp line around her eyes make her look hard. Either she should be . smudgy or wear none.' Never . one to shy away from controversy, Westwood was dressed in her usual wacky . style with an image of Julian Assange on her t-shirt. She said today's Red Label collection also carried the theme of quality over quantity, although that doesn't mean any less glamour. 'It's for anybody that wants to dress up [and be] wonderfully glamorous,' she revealed. Dame Vivienne Westwood's show featured lots of striped wool blanket coats, mulberry and wine and lame, trademark draping on dresses and skirts, a mullet dress and an asymmetric cardi - and a wrap that looked like a bath towel. The models' make up looked like it had been drawn on by a child but all in all the show, with Tyson Beckford and Meg Matthews in the front row, was pretty sane for Dame Westwood. As she is clearly here to sell bags and perfume, in a show at the Saatchi gallery on the King's Road, the home of punk itself, clearly much has changed.

She . said: 'I thought it was brilliant and I just loved the combination of . the colours, the tights, the clothes, the shoes, the bags, the . tailoring. 'I just wanted . absolutely every single piece, which is very rarefor me. I just loved . this collection. I thought it was fabulous.' The . statuesque blonde said while it may have been less dramatic than the . Westwood designs of previous years, the flair was still there and that . it was important to remember the evolving nature of fashion. Mix every shade of green with every type of pattern and voila . Unstructure: Sporty collar makes this Moretesque dress edgy . Teal tights: This combo is only for the very mad or very brave . Odd tailoring and fabric layering can only mean Westwood . Giant leather trousers: You thought they were a fleeting trend . A pop of purple/orange tartan punk this ladylike look right up . She added: 'There were bits in there - you know like the sequinned pants. 'But, you know, when I used to do Vivienne it used to be boobs and great big dresses and things like that. 'But, you know, fashion moves, it evolves. Designers have to go with it and I think she's really nailed it.' Before the show, Geldof said she was expecting it to be 'slightly mental', but said that is 'the charm of Westwood'. She . said of Westwood's style: 'It's really haphazard and sort of all over . the place, which I think is what Vivienne's mindset is like, and I . really like that the clothes are such a reflection of her and her . personality, and it's really playful and fun.'

"David Cameron has boldly declared that Britain’s mission will be ‘accomplished’ in Afghanistan by the time troops pull out next year – and that it should never again become a haven for terrorists. Appearing to dismiss fears that Taliban militants will return to wreak havoc, the Prime Minister, making what is set to be his last Christmas visit to British bases in the country, gave a startling upbeat assessment of the troubled country’s prospects 13 years into the conflict. Asked by reporters if the troops come home with ‘mission accomplished’, Mr Cameron said: ‘Yes, I think they do. I think they can come home with their heads held high.’ Scroll down for video . Support: Mr Cameron said when troops leave Afghanistan at the end of next year they will return to Britain with their 'heads held high' Mission: Prime Minister David Cameron, met British soldiers at Camp Bastion, outside Lashkar Gah during his traditional Christmas visit to troops . The Prime Minister insisted that the . main aim of the mission, which has claimed 446 British lives, was to . give the country ‘a basic level of security’ against terrorism, and he . said he was confident this had been achieved. His . remarks risked comparisons with the notorious ‘Mission Accomplished’ speech given by former US president George W Bush about Iraq in May . 2003  after Saddam Hussein’s regime had been overthrown, only for an . insurgency to take hold which claimed thousands of lives. Standing . on the flight deck of the USS Abraham Lincoln, Mr Bush declared that . ;in the battle of Iraq, the United States and our allies have . prevailed.’ While the . president did not utter the infamous phrase ‘mission accomplished’, he . made the speech against the backdrop of a huge banner bearing the . slogan. Echo: Mr Cameron's remarks drew comparisons with US President George W. Bush's speech aboard the nuclear aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln in 2003, declaring that it was 'mission accomplished' in Iraq . The incident came to . represent the failure of the United States and Britain to adequately . prepare for the initial invasion and toppling of Saddam Hussein's . regime. Mr Cameron, by contrast, did concede that allied forces will ‘not leave behind a perfect country or a perfect democracy’. ‘Afghanistan . is an extremely poor country with a very, very troubled history, but . the purpose of our mission is to build Afghan security forces that were . capable of maintaining a basic level of security so this country never . again became a haven for terrorist training camps, and I think the . Afghan security forces are capable,’ he said. 'That . has been the most important part of the mission. Now it's also good . that there are six million children in school, including two million . girls. It's good that Afghanistan now has far better health services . than it ever did ten years ago, it's good that here we are in Helmand . with elected district governors and basic levels of governance and . services that didn't exist before. 'All . these are important but to me, but - and the National Security council . said this very clearly - to me the absolute driving part of the mission . is a basic level of security so that it doesn’t become a haven for . terror. That is the mission. That was the mission and I think we will . have accomplished our mission so our troops can be very proud of what . they have done.' All combat . troops will be pulled out of Afghanistan by the end of 2014 – with . numbers serving in the country already reduced from the peak of 9,500 to . round 5,200 by Christmas. Mr . Cameron said the timetable for withdrawal would not change depending on . the security situation, saying ‘we are sticking to that track.’ In June . this year the Afghan National Army and security forces took over . responsibility for security across the country  with British forces in a . supporting and training role. Festive: Mr Cameron joined soldiers for breakfast at Camp Bastion, where the mess was decked out for Christmas . Fry-up: The PM helped himself to bacon and eggs alongside serving soldiers . Michael . Owen let the Prime Minister pull rank when it came to choosing which . bunk bed to sleep in as they flew out to Afghanistan together, the . footballer has revealed. The . pair shared a small cabin on a C-17 military transport plane during the . eight- hour journey from Brize Norton in Oxfordshire to Camp Bastion. Owen told reporters: 'I obviously let the PM choose first. He chose top. I was quite surprised myself. 'I . couldn't hear anything. I was wondering if he was going to snore but I . couldn't hear anything with the noise up there and obviously you can . hear the pilots all the time. 'So, let's say it wasn't the best of sleeps, but who's to complain? We were in the best place.'Mr Cameron later praised his flight companion: 'Well, he's charming. He's a very nice guy.' He . added that since he took office in 2010, ‘what we've done in that time . is train up a hugely capable Afghan National Army and police force now . numbering almost 350,000 and I think more than capable of providing the . basic level of security that this country needs.’ Military . personnel are concerned that violence may erupt in the weeks running up . to the Afghan elections on April 5 when current president Hamid Karzai . will hand over to a successor for the first time since 2001. Most of the . troops coming home next year will only be pulled out in the summer . after the elections are over. British . military figures admitted that while the Afghan security forces were . performing well and the insurgency had been far weaker this year than in . previous years, militants may still target candidate and election . officials. One military . source said: ‘The campaign here is on track and the Afghans are in a . good place in the short, medium and long term. 'The insurgency will have a . go, they will still be having goes next year at electoral officials but . against the very credible and capable Afghan National Security Force. At the moment the insurgency are just trying to regenerate and . reorganise for the next phase.’ Mr . Cameron also had lunch with troops on the frontline and sent a ‘Bluey’ – . a letter from the Armed Forces postal service -- telling the forces: . ‘You should be proud of what you have achieved here in Afghanistan. ‘It . has been a long road and we have suffered losses but your work is . building an Afghan army and police force that can keep this country safe . and keep our country safe too.’ Flight: Mr Cameron made his visit after travelling on a C-17 military transport plane from Brize Norton in Oxfordshire to Camp Bastion . Strategy: Mr Cameron was briefed by British army officers at the forward operating base Sterga II at Helmand province in southern Afghanistan . Meeting: Mr Cameron was joined by former England footballer Michael Owen during the trip., where they discussed a match at Wembley between England and Afghanistan . Asked . whether Mr Cameron was seeking to echo former President Bush’s . announcement of the end of major combat  operations in Iraq in front of a . banner reading ‘mission accomplished’, the Prime Minister's official . spokesman pointed out that the words were initially introduced by a . journalist to whose question he was responding. ‘I think it's understandable. He was asked a question, he answered in the way he did,’ said the spokesman. The . spokesman added: ‘The Prime Minister was explaining what the armed . forces have achieved.  Is the situation in Afghanistan a perfect one? As . the Prime Minister himself has said, No. ‘But . has the situation improved significantly in terms of the threat that . the terrorists posed? - because that's the reason we intervened. Yes, it . has and that is as a result of the  achievements of our armed forces.’ David Cameron, left, poses for pictures with former England footballer Michael Owen, 2nd right, and unidentified Afghan Football Association officials and players . The Prime Minister backed a plan for the England football team to play the Afghan national side in a landmark 'peace match' at Wembley Stadium to mark the end of the conflict. He was in Camp Bastion with England legend Michael Owen, who had a kickaround with troops to launch a major new partnership between the FA and the Afghan Premier League. David Cameron said a symbolic football match when troops return home next year was an 'excellent idea'. He said: 'I’m sure that there will be many very dignified national events that should take place...but the idea of one part of it being a football match I think is a very nice idea.' The match is reminiscent of the truce match played between England and Germany during the First World War. They played in No Man's Land at Christmas 1914 and the match between British and Afghan troops is likely to take place around the centenary. Mr Owen said it would be a 'fantastic occasion'. The footballer who retired last season after 14 years in the game, said: 'In the association the Afghan FA have with ours, I think there's the opportunity for them to come over and train at our national centre St Georges Park and  there could be a fully fledged game at Wembley one day - that would be fantastic to mark the occasion. 'They are big into their football and big into the Premier League so I think they would be welcomed. It would a fantastic occasion. I don't know what the politics would be, but it would be great to mark the end of the conflict with a game certainly at Wembley.' He is one of the Football Association's 150 ambassadors. Robert Sullivan, head of corporate affairs at the FA said the match was a 'long term ambition'. Mr Cameron, who watched troops play a team from the Afghan National Army, said: 'I think football has an immense ability to bring people together, bring countries together and as we leave Afghanistan we are not leaving it alone in the world. 'We are going to go on funding its Armed Services, we are going to go on supporting its development. We are going to be helping it have a football league.'","Prime Minister echoes George W Bush during visit to Camp Bastion .

"The child at the centre of the Toddlers & Tiaras 'Go Go Juice' scandal is to appear in her own TLC reality series. Alana, six, whose mother was accused of 'doping' her with caffeinated drinks and high sugar snacks after appearing on an episode in January, is to star in Here Comes Honey Boo Boo. The six-part series, due to premiere in August, will follow the youngster and her 'coupon queen' mother, June, as they go about their lives in rural McIntyre, Georgia. Reality star: Toddlers & Tiaras' most controversial subject, Alana, six, is to appear in her own six-part series . According to the network, it will see the family 'doing what [they] do best: four-wheeling through mud pits and picking up road kill for the family cookout.' The show will also introduce her chalk-miner father, Sugar Bear, and three sisters: Lauryn, aka 'Pumpkin', . 12, Jessica, or 'Chubbs', 15, and pregnant 17-year-old Anna, known to the family as 'Chickadee'. A press release reads that the show 'takes us off the pageant stage and into the unapologetically outrageous family life of the Honey Boo Boo clan.' Alana and her mother were at the centre of a storm of controversy after their appearance on Toddlers & Tiaras at the start of this year. The episode saw June tell how . she created her 'Go-Go Juice' mixture of Mountain Dew and Red Bull after 15 bags of Pixy Stix  - tubes of powdered sugar often known as 'pageant . crack' - failed . to boost her daughter's energy. Controversy: Alana joined her mother, June, on Good Morning America in January as she defended her decision to use the Mountain Dew and Red Bull mixture as a pre-pageant energy booster . Insiders speculate that some mothers' 'special juice' blends may even contain alcohol. June was filmed instructing Alana to take 'two big gulps' from an . unlabelled bottle. Within seconds the change was apparent and the . pageant hopeful was seen rapidly swinging her arms over her head and . spinning around on the floor, exclaiming: 'My go-go juice is kicking in . right now!' Describing how . the drink made her feel, she said: 'Go-go juice makes me laughy, and . play-ey, and makes me feel like I want to pull my mommy's hair.' It seems Alana is already a spirited child though. She has a bizarre speaking manner that is at once precocious and incoherent. Energy boost: June was accused of 'doping' her daughter with the high-caffeine mixture . Hyper: Moments after having her 'special drink' Alana was filmed spinning on her stomach . She tells cameras that she wants to win pageants to make money because 'a dollar makes me holler, honey boo boo!' But she is not entirely enthusiastic about the experience. She continues: 'Beauty is so boring, I don't want to do it.' June's enthusiasm is more than evident though. As her daughter takes . to the stage, she is filmed yelling encouragement, and instructing . dance moves. When she is not . accompanying her daughter on the pageant circuit, June says she spends . her time collecting money-saving coupons and stockpiling hundreds of . household products - a pursuit her daughter claims she wants to follow.

"Stonehenge attracts around one million visitors each year and now archaeologists have revealed that it was ‘the London of the Mesolithic’ – and even had an ancient ‘visitor’s centre’. Ancient Britons from far and wide were drawn to Stonehenge to see the area’s pink flint and the River Avon acted as an ‘A-Road’ carrying people to a nearby settlement at Blick Mead where feasts and tour guides were available even before the monument was built, one archaeologist has claimed. It is now thought that there was an established community in the area before the monument was built and that people travelled to the settlement in log boats. An ancient tourist attraction: Ancient Britons from far and wide were drawn to Stonehenge to see the area¿s pink flint and the River Avon acted as an 'A-Road' carrying people to the location where feasts and tour guides were available, one archaeologist has claimed . It had long been thought Thatcham in Buckinghamshire was the oldest continuous settlement in the UK, but researchers have now bestowed the title on Amesbury in Wiltshire. The location is home to Stonehenge and now holds the claim of being the birthplace of history in Britain - an honour confirmed by the Guinness Book of Records. It is thought the settlement dates back more than 10 millennia to 8,820BC. David Jacques of the University of Buckingham said:'The area was clearly a hub point for people to come to from many miles away, and in many ways was a forerunner for what later went on at Stonehenge itself. The first monuments at Stonehenge were built by these people' Carbon dating of bones from giant bulls and boars discarded at Vespsian’s Camp, Blick Mead - a settlement around a mile from the monument - prove that Amesbury is the oldest settlement in Britain and has been continually occupied since 8,820BC. Archaeologists think that the communities that built the monument lived and worked in the area for around 3,000 years and that Stonehenge was built as part of an established settlement, rather than a monument in an empty landscape. They have also ruled out the possibility of the monument being built by European immigrants and think the giant stones were placed by indigenous hunters and homemakers. The team found that Mesolithic cultures cleared land around Blick Mead between 7,500 and 4,600BC, which they had thought was an activity previously thought to be a part of the ‘farming package’ brought in by Neolithic immigrants from the continent in the 5th millennium BC. Main attraction: Before Stonehenge was built there was a settlement on Blick Mead and people used the River Avon to access the community from the east and west (pictured), which is thought to have erected the famous stone monument . Archaeologists also recovered the largest haul of Mesolithic worked flints (some pictured) across the Mesolithic period ever found.  A total of 31,000 were discovered in an area measuring  52ft (16 square metres) 2,000 of which were concentrated in just a metre squared . The persistent use of the site for nearly 3,000 years and the fact that many of the tools found were for domestic purposes rather than hunting ones also points to the fact that people were settling there .Previously it was thought that there weren’t any settlers until Neolithic times. David Jacques, research fellow in archaeology at the University of Buckingham, who led the dig, said that the site ‘provides evidence for people staying put, clearing land, building, and presumably worshipping, monuments. ‘The area was clearly a hub point for people to come to from many miles away, and in many ways was a forerunner for what later went on at Stonehenge itself. The first monuments at Stonehenge were built by these people. Carbon dating from an archaeological dig has found the parish of Amesbury in Wiltshire has been continually occupied for every millennia since 8,820BC - making it the oldest settlement in the UK. These pieces of flint were found at the site on Vespasian's Camp, Blick Mead - a mile-and-a-half from Stonehenge . Historic: The dig in Amesbury, which took place in October and was funded by the University of Buckingham, also unearthed the largest haul of worked flints from the Mesolithic period . Experts from the University of Buckingham claim the new findings dismiss previous theories that Amesbury, marked at A, was conceived by European immigrants. 'In effect, Blick Mead (near the settlement) was the very first Stonehenge Visitor Centre, up and running in the 8th millennium BC,' one archaeologist said . ‘In effect, Blick Mead was the very . first Stonehenge Visitor Centre, up and running in the 8th millennium . BC. The River Avon would have been the A-Road – people would have come . down on their log boats. ‘They would have had the equivalent of tour guides and there would have been feasting.’ The settlement was confirmed using carbon dating on bones that belonged to aurochs - animals once twice the size of bulls, illustration pictured . The team of archaeologists found remains . of big game animals and a large amount of burnt flint from their . feasting fires as well as tools that suggest people travelled to the . site from the east and west. ‘Another possible reason why people were attracted to the area was the striking bright pink colouring of the flint, which isn’t that colour anywhere else in the country,’ he said. The pink colour of the flint was caused by Hildenbrandia rivularis algae and is due to a combination of dappled light and the unusually warm spring water in the area. Dr Jacques said: ‘It’s unique to have people of that time come from so many different faraway places. The site and the Stonehenge areas were very well known places to visit for a very long time – the London of the Mesolithic.’ Archaeologists also recovered the largest haul of Mesolithic worked flints across the Mesolithic period ever found. A total of 31,000 were discovered in an area measuring  52ft (16 square metres) 2,000 of which were concentrated in just a metre squared.","Ancient Britons travelled from far and wide to see pink flint, have feasts and tours of the area surrounding Stonehenge, one archaeologist claims .

"Sol Campbell has branded the Football Association institutionally racist and claimed that he would have been England captain for 10 years if he had been white. The former Tottenham, Arsenal and Portsmouth defender, who won 73 caps with England, makes the claim in his biography, which is published later this month. In it, he says he was overlooked for the captaincy, which was awarded to Michael Owen, because of the colour of his skin. Rare: Campbell was captain for three friendly games in 1998 and 2005 but never received it long term . Campbell said: 'I believe that if I was white I would have been England captain for 10 years. 'I don't think it [the situation] will change because they don't want it. It's all right to have a black or mixed race captain of the Under 18s or Under 21s but not for the full national side. 'There is a ceiling and, although no one has ever said it, I believe it's made of glass. 'Michael Owen was made captain ahead of me and I thought, ""What's going on here?"" I think the FA didn't want me to have a voice. 'Owen was a fantastic forward but nowhere near being a captain. I've asked myself many times why I wasn't [named captain].

Paul Ince and Rio Ferdinand have also captained the side in short spells and Ferdinand was captain going into the last World Cup finals under Fabio Capello - before injury ruled him out. But England have never had an established black captain. The FA are unlikely to respond directly to Campbell's claim though they believe it to be untrue. However, it will raise the issue of race once again for English football's governing body, following a week in which the FA disciplinary panel were criticised for accepting that Nicolas Anelka had not intended to be anti-semitic when performing the now infamous 'quenelle' salute after scoring for West Brom against West Ham last December. The FA have also been criticised for the length of time it took to charge Anelka and for the leniency of a four-game ban incurred by John Terry after an FA disciplinary panel found that he had racially abused Anton Ferdinand.

"The sleepy Dorset village of Highcliffe is a million miles away from the hustle and bustle of London's Oxford Street, but here lies one of its most famous traders. The simple grave of Harry Gordon Selfridge at St Mark's Churchyard contains no clues about the lavish lifestyle the man who revolutionised shopping once led. Selfridge was the  American entrepreneur behind Selfridge's, . London’s famous department store, a self-made millionaire who . turned retail on its head because he understood what women wanted and . gave it to them in style. Retail pioneer Harry Selfridge's grave at St Mark's Churchyard at Highcliffe, Dorset. It is an unassuming legacy for so important a man . Selfridge's grave, right, is separated from that of his wife by two other gravestones . The grave is covered in leaves and lies at the base of an ivy hedgerow, inscribed with only the few simple words 'IN LOVING MEMORY HARRY GORDON SELFRIDGE 1857 - 1947'. Selfridge is laid to rest, separated by two unmarked graves, next to his wife Rosalie 'Rose' Buckingham. During the years of the Great Depression, Selfridge watched his fortune rapidly decline and then disappear - a situation not helped by his continuing free-spending ways. In 1941, he left Selfridges and moved from his lavish home. In 1947 he died, aged 91, in straitened circumstances at Putney, in south-west London. At the height of his fortune, Selfridge leased as his family home Highcliffe Castle in Hampshire (now Dorset). The grave of Selfridge's wife, Rosalie 'Rose' Buckingham.

Born in 1856, his father deserted the family when he was just five, and his two older brothers later died, leaving Harry and his mother alone. After getting a job as a lowly sock boy in a Chicago department store, Harry swiftly rose to the top and eventually opened his own store. At first leaving his wife, Rose, and their four children in the U.S., he bought the now famous site on Oxford Street and set about creating a palatial, five-storey store. It opened in 1909 and was a sensation. Selfridge was an inspired retailer. He invented the phrase ‘the customer . is always right’, understood that shopping was about sex appeal and made Selfridge’s a London landmark.

"Fears were rising last night that Russia could seek to grab more territory in eastern Europe as Moscow's noose tightened in Crimea with Ukraine troops forced into abject surrender. U.S. Vice President Joe Biden sought to reassure the three ex-Soviet Baltic republics of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia that America will defend any NATO member against aggression. 'We're in this with you, together,' he said in Vilnius, amid jitters in three countries overrun by Stalin during the Second World War which only won their freedom with the collapse of the Soviet Union. He said: 'Russia cannot escape the fact that the world is changing and rejecting outright their behaviour.' Scroll down for video . 'We're in this with you': U.S. Vice President Joe Biden vowed America will defend any NATO member from aggression as ex-Soviet states expressed concerns over the developments in Crimea . Talks: U.S. Vice President Joe Biden met with Lithuania's President Dalia Grybauskaite (centre) and Latvia's President Andris Berzins (left) on Wednesday . Under threat: Lithuania's President Dalia Grybauskaite told Biden that Putin's annexing of Crimea was a direct threat to regional security . Pressing forward: President Vladimir Putin, pictured on Wednesday, has signed a treaty to annex Crimea . But Lithuanian president Dalia Grybauskaite warned him Vladimir Putin's annexing of Crimea showed 'the use of brute force to redraw the map of Europe', adding: 'This situation is a direct threat to our regional security.' The sombre mood was reflected by Bulgarian president, Rosen Plevneliev, who said in London: 'What about Lithuania? What about Estonia? We do have Russian communities and minorities there. 'Is it possible in the 21st Century that they can call Moscow - and Moscow will send troops and occupy and annex some part of their territory?' This came amid reports of FSB secret services agents flooding into Transdniestria, a breakaway pro-Moscow region of ex-Soviet state Moldova which shares a border with Ukraine. In recent days the leadership of the region - where Russian troops are believed to be on the ground - has signaled their wish to be integrated into Russia, like Crimea. The Crimean leader Sergey Aksyonov, meanwhile, openly urged the Kremlin to go deeper into Ukraine to 'protect' ethnic Russians. 'The surge in patriotism we are witnessing in Crimea and Russia, which has united everyone irrespective of political views, convictions and political parties, shall spread farther, into southeastern Ukraine,' he said.

Russians in these areas 'have fixed their eyes on us, they are hopeful and they expect our support and assistance. People truly need this,' he insisted. NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said he was 'deeply concerned'  over the spiraling crisis and urged all sides to 'take all possible steps to avoid further escalation', while Nikolai Petrov, professor at the Higher Economic School in Moscow, forecast 'a new Cold War'. Concern was also rising last night over Russia's bid to steamroller 20,000 Ukrainian troops in Crimea to defect to Moscow, or surrender and be sent back to Kiev. While many gave up without a fight to prevent bloodshed, the peninsula remained a tinderbox after Ukraine - which refuses to accept the Russian annexation of the Black Sea peninsula - gave permission for its forces to shoot in self-defence. The Ukrainian naval base in Sevastopol fell without a shot, but 100 loyal servicemen were barricaded inside tonight refusing to bow to the Kremlin's orders.

'We're throwing grenades from time to time so that they can't approach us. We have also put up armed guards,' said a commander. Russian Black Sea fleet commander Aleksandr Vitko warned: 'Hotheads in the current Ukrainian leadership spoke of permission to resort to arms. 'I would like to warn everyone, and above all Ukrainian Navy personnel: God forbid anyone should shoot even a catapult. Don't play with fire. I ask to be taken literally.' Some Ukrainian naval forces dejectedly filed out of the naval base saying they had nowhere to go after 20 years service. One was in tears as he left. Putin's spokesman said 'they will have to take a decision' whether to join the Russian armed forces or be sent to Ukraine. It coincided with Ukraine announcing plans to withdraw troops from Crimea to the mainland on Wednesday night.

'They are not welcome in Crimea,' said local pro-Moscow leader Sergey Aksyonov. Russia was tonight poised to seize 20 Ukrainian warships. Ukrainian military inspectors yesterday began an official reconnaissance of two Russian regions for evidence of a massive military build-up indicating a threat of imminent invasion. The inspection - amid high tension between the two countries - is under an international agreement and gives four Ukrainian military specialists the right to examine Russian operations in Belgorod and Kursk regions. The team will monitor around 13,000 square kilometres by helicopter to check for 'undeclared military activity'.

'During the inspection the Ukrainian experts will have an opportunity to monitor the specified area - including with the use of road transport and a helicopter flight - to make sure that no military activity, threatening Ukraine, is conducted there,' said Russian official Sergei Ryzhkov. It follows claims that Russian forces pushed to the frontiers of Ukraine in these and other regions, notably Rostov, which is close to the Ukrainian city of Rostov, scene of a number of pro-Moscow protests. The inspection over several days is under the Vienna Document of 2011, an agreement between members of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe.

"A bullying paramedic who let down one of the tyres on her ambulance to dodge an emergency call-out has been struck off. Victoria Parker admitted she had been a ‘stupid a**e’ for sticking a pen into the tyre to let out air so she could finish her shift on time. She was guilty of misconduct and dishonesty by avoiding the call to help an elderly lady who had suffered a fall, a Health Professions Council panel ruled. Accusation: Victoria Parker let out air from an ambulance tyre to avoid attending an emergency call-out, a hearing was told . Parker, who was a paramedic with the East of England Ambulance NHS Trust, was adjudged to have put patients at risk by deliberately putting the ambulance out of service. Parker, who has since quit the service and moved to Australia, was also found to have bullied and intimidated junior colleagues. She was banned from practising for at least five years. Panel chairman Clare Reggiori said: ‘The registrant’s actions on more than one occasion of causing an otherwise sound ambulance to be taken off the road for entirely selfish reasons had the potential to put patients at risk. ‘There was very little evidence that the registrant had shown insight into the possible impact of her conduct on patients who might have suffered as a consequence of the ambulances being off the road.’ Parker, who did not attend the hearing at Whitefield House in London, admitted letting a tyre down 30 minutes before the end of her shift on May 19, 2009, to avoid treating the elderly woman in South Woodham Ferrers, Essex. Allegation: Parker used a pen to deflate the nearside front tyre of the ambulance, the Health Professions Council heard . During the trust’s internal investigation, she admitted: ‘I untwiddled the valve cap and with my pen I let a little air out of the tyre. ‘I told control we had a slow flat. I didn’t tell anyone about this. ‘I am a stupid a**e.’ Parker had also confessed to repeating the trick on March 10, 2010, during an internal assessment day, but the panel said it could not be sure this was true after hearing ‘vague’ witness evidence. Parker was responsible for supervising student paramedics at Rayleigh Ambulance Station. Parker claimed to have got on with paramedics Clair Flynn, Gail Newman, and Samantha Watson, but they gave evidence contradicting this.

Ms Reggiori said: ‘The registrant’s actions were serious, deliberate, wilful and reckless. As found by the panel, they were also dishonest. ‘They also involved student paramedics for whom the registrant was responsible while they were in her charge. No-show: Parker, who has moved to Australia, did not attend the hearing at Whitefield House in London . ‘She was a person to whom they should be able to look to for guidance on proper professional standards and behaviour. ‘Her conduct in bullying her colleagues demonstrated, in the panel’s view, a deep-seated attitudinal problem about which the registrant appeared to have virtually no insight. ‘We saw at first hand the very profound effect which her conduct still has on those of her colleagues who gave evidence at this hearing.’ Parker has shown little remorse for her actions, the panel ruled. It also raised concerns about the training of student paramedics at the trust, and ordered for a copy of the ruling to be sent to the chief executive. An allegation that Parker instructed a student paramedic to falsify paperwork following the tyre incident was not proven, the panel found.","Victoria Parker avoided helping an elderly lady who had suffered a fall in Essex .

"Dozens of Conservative MPs are urging David Cameron to give Parliament a veto over all EU laws, in an attempt to take back control of Britain’s borders. Up to 80 backbenchers are expected to sign a letter to the Prime Minister calling for Parliament to be given the right to throw out existing laws from Brussels and block new ones. The MPs say the move would allow Britain to ‘recover control over our borders, lift EU burdens on business, (and) regain control over energy policy...in popular and sensible ways.’ Up to 80 backbenchers are expected to sign the letter calling for the right to throw out existing laws from Brussels so Britain can 'recover control over our borders' (file picture) The letter will pile pressure on Mr Cameron to go further in addressing public concern about EU immigration and interference by Brussels. The intervention comes as Home Secretary Theresa May prepares to release a report floating the idea of capping immigration from the EU at 75,000 a year. The Home Office document, part of a Government-wide review of EU laws, suggests a cap could cut net migration from EU countries by 30,000 from the current 106,000 a year. But critics said the move would be illegal, unless Britain quits the European Union – and questioned whether Mrs May was trying to burnish her reputation for taking a tough line on immigration. Former shadow home secretary David Davis said any action would almost certainly be too late to prevent an influx of migrants from Romania and Bulgaria when transitional controls are lifted next month. Home Secretary Theresa May is preparing to release a report floating the idea of capping immigration from the EU at 75,000 a year . Mr Davis told the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show: ‘The Government is caught because it doesn’t want to have a fight with the EU courts and the Commission over it, but that’s where it’s going. ‘Theresa May, the Home Office, are looking at a variety of policies to try to bring it under control. I have to say straight away it’s a bit like closing the stable door after the horse has bolted.’ The Home Office Paper also suggests . blocking EU immigrants from claiming benefits or tax credits for their . first five years in the UK. Other plans include giving British citizens a ‘national preference’ by explicitly reserving jobs for them and limiting labour movement from poorer countries. UKIP leader Nigel Farage accused ministers of ‘desperate spin’ adding that the only way to achieve the measures ‘would be to leave the European Union’. A senior Liberal Democrat source described the proposals as ‘ridiculous’, adding: ‘Even the Tories don’t think they can renegotiate to that extreme. The amount of British people it would impact would far outweigh the people they’re trying to stop, and British business would be crippled.’ The Prime Minister has responded to mounting public concern about EU immigration with a series of policy proposals in recent weeks, including curbing access to benefits and requiring migrants to speak English. But the European Commission has warned it will take the UK to court if measures breach the EU’s freedom of movement principle.","Up to 80 backbenchers expected to sign letter to the Prime Minister .

"Criticism: Lin Homer went from the Border Agency to a £180k HMRC role . The country’s top woman civil servant is clinging to her £180,000-a-year job after being accused by MPs of a 'catastrophic failure of leadership' on securing Britain's borders. Lin Homer's disastrous tenure in charge of the UK Border Agency lead to a huge backlog of hundreds of thousands of immigration cases. But astonishingly she emerged unscathed and was rewarded with promotion through the civil service and is now in charge of HM Revenue and Customs. The powerful home affairs committee today said they were ‘astounded’ she was considered suitable for the job of collecting the nation’s taxes. Chairman Keith Vaz hit out at 'incompetent' Mrs Homer receiving £20,000 in bonuses despite leaving the UKBA in a 'worst position' than when she started. There were also signs ministers were finally losing faith with the mandarin. A senior Whitehall source said: ‘There are increasing concerns from ministers as to why there are no penalties for poor performance in the civil service. Instead what we have is a “promotions-all-round” culture. ‘There needs to be penalties for the worst performers and better career paths for those who are doing well. If someone has a terrible track record of delivery, should they really be being promoted? ‘The civil service does not do talent management properly.’ The select committee accused Mrs Homer of repeatedly misleading MPs and called for Parliament to be given greater say over appointing of top civil servants. The MPs said: ‘It is shocking that after five years under Lin Homer’s leadership an organisation that was described at the beginning of the period as being not fit for purpose should have improved its performance so little. ‘Given this background, we are astounded Mrs Homer has been promoted to become chief executive and permanent secretary at Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs.’ UK Border Agency has been heavily criticised after it emerged backlog would take 24 years to clear . Born in Norfolk, Ms Homer studied law at University College London, before working at Reading Council for two years then Hertfordshire Council, where over a period of 15 years, she rose to the position of Director of Corporate Services. This proved the springboard for her first major town hall job, in 1998, as chief executive of Suffolk Council. Just four years later, the married mother of three daughters was parachuted into the same post at Birmingham City Council, on a jaw-dropping £174,000-year. In 2005 she was accused of throwing ‘the rule book out of the window’ in a major postal votes scandal in Birmingham that ended up before the courts. Election judge Richard Mawrey said fraud in the city ‘would have disgraced a banana republic’. He described Mrs Homer’s decision to allow postal ballot papers to be transported to the count in shopping bags as ‘the direst folly’. But later that year she was chosen by the Home Office to run what was then called the Immigration and Nationality Directorate – this time on £200,000, plus bonuses. Already in chaos, it was on her watch in 2006 that we learned of the mistaken release of 1,000 foreign criminals. It later emerged some 450,000 asylum cases had not been dealt with but left in boxes at the Home Office. The new UKBA was meant to clear up the mess, and Mrs Homer became its first chief executive, on an astonishing £208,000 a year. But among a fresh run of scandals was the revelation that nearly 400 of the 1,000 foreign prisoners were told they could stay in Britain and dozens remained untraced. Promotion came again in 2011 when she was handed the the post of Permanent Secretary at the Transport Department where she stayed for barely a year before winning her biggest job to date – running HMRC. Since then she has been criticised for failing to tackle tax avoidance, admitting in November last year that over half of Britain’s biggest 770 firms funnel profits overseas. In a damning indictment of her abilities, the MPs say they can 'have little confidence in her ability to lead HMRC at what is a challenging time for that organisation'. It points out that the woman oversaw a huge backlog in immigration cases at UKBA has since admitted that her new department at HMRC left 1million letters  unanswered throughout 2012. Today Mr Vaz insisted senior civil servants involved in the chaos should not be rewarded with new plum jobs. 'People . just can’t go on to be promoted to other jobs unless they answer for . what’s happened. She has apologised, but we felt that more should have . been done,' he told BBC Radio 4. Ministers were repeatedly not given . accurate data on immigration levels. 'Most of this happened under the . leadership of Lin Homer when she headed the UKBA for five years, despite . getting bonuses of £20,000,' Mr Vaz added. 'When she left the organisation, I’m . afraid, it was left it something of a worst position than she arrived. We now have a third of a million cases in backlog. We should actually . rename this agency: United Kingdom Backlog Agency because of the number . of things not dealt with.' He added that letters sent by Mrs . Homer to the committee were 'frankly incompetent' and he had to . 'introduce her to pie charts and graphs' to ensure the information was . accurate. Matthew Sinclair of the TaxPayers’ Alliance said: ‘Taxpayers are sick to death of senior civil servants . presiding over failure only to move on without being held to account for . their past actions. ‘At worst Whitehall rewards the incompetent with payoffs or promotions, at best it just shuffles them sideways.’ But . Mrs Homer has written to MPs saying: ‘It is wholly inaccurate and . unfair to seek to ascribe responsibility to me for matters of concern . that occurred long after I left the agency.’ This is despite MPs today warning that border officials require 24 years to clear their backlog of 320,000 immigration cases. Incompetence and foot-dragging is blamed for the sheer number of claims – the equivalent of the population of Iceland. In . a blistering report, the Commons home affairs committee also said the . army of foreign criminals on the streets was growing, with the total now . almost 4,000. The audit into the work of the UK Border Agency, which was dubbed not fit for purpose six years ago, found 321,726 outstanding cases involving immigrants. These include 28,500 current asylum cases, 4,000 immigration cases and 181,541 people placed in a so-called Migration Refusal Pool. The pool comprises migrants who arrived legally but cannot now be found after their work or study visas expired. Officials say many of the migrants will have gone home – a view disputed by the MPs, who say the lack of proper border checks may mean ‘tens of thousands’ are still here. They are highly critical of the slow pace at which officials are clearing the backlog. Between July and September last year, it was reduced by only 3,430 – or 1 per cent. This is despite officials writing off 74,000 cases held in the separate ‘asylum controlled archive’ over that period. Keith Vaz, right, said hardly any progress is being made in clearing the backlog, while Immigration Minister Mark Harper, left, said the UK Border Agency is a 'troubled organisation' The controlled archive was created to . hold what remains of Labour’s asylum backlog. It was intended to hold . cases that had not been concluded, so they could be reopened if the . person was traced. UKBA officials had been tracking them down – but decided to abandon those they couldn’t find. Critics say it amounts to have an effective ‘amnesty’. Keith Vaz, the Labour MP who chairs the home affairs committee, said hardly any progress was being made in clearing the backlog. He holds former UKBA chief executive Lin Homer – Britain’s most senior female mandarin – responsible for much of the debacle. She is clinging to her job in charge of HM Revenue & Customs after MPs concluded she was guilty of a ‘catastrophic’ failure of leadership during her time at UKBA. Mr Vaz said: ‘No sooner is one backlog closed, than four more are discovered. ‘At this rate it will take 24 years to clear the backlog which still stands at the size of the population of Iceland.’ Also within the backlog are 3,980 foreign criminals who cannot be deported and have been released on bail by the courts. This has increased by 26 in only three . months, despite repeated government promises to kick the offenders out. Six years ago the asylum backlog scandal prompted then home secretary . John Reid to brand the immigration system ‘not fit for purpose’. The committee recommends senior UKBA staff are not paid bonuses until there is evidence the backlog is being ‘substantially’ reduced and new backlogs are not emerging. Yvette Cooper, Labour’s home affairs spokesman, said: ‘This highly critical report shows that practical failings in the immigration system are getting worse.’ Immigration minister Mark Harper said: ‘We have always been clear the UK Border Agency was a troubled organisation with a poor record of delivery. ‘Turning it around will take time but I am determined to provide the public with an immigration system they can have confidence in.’ The Border Agency has awarded a £30million contract to outsourcing firm Capita to help track illegals. It began work in October.","Damning report demands to know why Lin Homer went from overseeing immigration chaos to running the tax office .

"Ed Miliband has admitted that public mistrust of politicians will be Labour's biggest challenge at the next general election. He insisted public anger with David Cameron and the coalition was growing in the wake of a no-change Budget, asking: 'Can you imagine another five years of this?' However, he also conceded that his party still has work to do to convince voters there is an alternative to grim austerity. Scroll down for video . Ed Miliband believes that the biggest problem for the Labour party just now is public mistrust of politicians . The comments came in an address to a 'people's policy forum' in Birmingham this afternoon. Mr Miliband reeled off a list of policies that he claims would kick-start growth and make the economy fairer, including bank reform, infrastructure investment and a 10p tax rate. He contrasted the platform he is fleshing out with George Osborne's financial package this week. 'All they offer is more of the same and that's not enough. Can you imagine another five years of this? 'Low growth. Living standards squeezed further. You paying the price. Ed Miliband asks if the public really want another five years of David Cameron's government . 'They are resigned to a lost decade. A lost decade Britain cannot afford. A lost decade of national decline. 'Not a decade where we make sacrifices now to build a better future, but where things get worse not better.' Mr Miliband told the audience - billed as representing political opinion from across the West Midlands - that he had tried to understand the Labour government's mistakes on issues such as banking regulation, immigration and Iraq. But he said there was now 'an increasing disappointment and disillusionment with this Government' among the public. 'They don't believe David Cameron can turn Britain around,' he added. 'But let me be clear with you. I know that however discredited, divided and damaging this Government becomes, it doesn't necessarily translate into support for us. 'We have to earn your trust. Indeed, many people will believe that the failure of this Government means they should give up on politics altogether. 'That nobody can turn round the problems of the country and nobody deserves their vote. That is a terrible thing for our democracy. 'I understand that some people think the problems are so great that no no one can fix them. 'But I passionately believe that Labour can. That we can turn round the problems of the country.'

"Click here to read Martin Samuel's match report from the Etihad Stadium. Manchester City boss Manuel Pellegrini was left unimpressed by the performance of referee Michael Oliver after his side's 1-0 win against rivals Manchester United. The Chilean felt City should have been awarded three penalties at the Etihad but they had to rely on Sergio Aguero's 63rd minute strike after Oliver waved away a trio of appeals. Aguero twice went down inside United's area, while Yaya Toure appeared to be caught by Marcos Rojo when clear through on goal late in the first half.

Click here to read former Premier League referee Graham Poll explaining why Manuel Pellegrini is wrong about Marcos Rojo's challenge on Yaya Toure. Speaking after the game, Pellegrini said: 'I think that first of all the most important thing is to win the derby. 'During match I think we played very, very well. We scored and in that moment we dropped back a little bit more. We lost the high possession of the ball we had before. It's normal in the derby. 'Before that we played really well, we had clear chances to score and should have had penalties. Unbelievable. We can survey all those things and finally we won. 'One of the important things is to win instead of those things (the penalties), to not let it disturb your mind.' City's biggest appeal arrived on the brink of half-time when Toure went down in the box after a lunge from summer signing Rojo, a challenge Pellegrini believes was worthy of a red card. Referee Michael Oliver did not award Manchester City a penalty but did send of United defender Chris Smalling . Toure is left on the turf after Rojo's risky tackle late on in the first half at the Etihad Stadium . Ivory Coast midfielder Toure throws his hands up in frustration after not being given a spot-kick . He added: 'The penalty against Yaya was not only a penalty but also a sending off. There were two others against Sergio. But I am not talking about that, the referees make the decisions. 'I don't want to talk about referees because I did it just once after the game against Arsenal. It's not the way to do it. It is a very difficult profession being a referee.'

"Concerns: Theresa May fears a Grexit could mean migrants flooding into Britain to look for work . The government is drawing emergency plans over fears Britain will be flooded with migrants from Greece and other European nations should the eurozone crisis deepen, Home Secretary Theresa May has revealed. Should Greece leave the euro and go bankrupt, as many predict will happen at the start of next year, millions could lose their jobs and be forced to search for work abroad. There are fears too that contagion could spread to other weak eurozone countries and because Britain is outside the single currency it is widely regarded as an economic safe haven. The Home Secretary told The Daily Telegraph that  'work is ongoing' to deal with large movements of people in the event of the break-up of the single currency. Mrs May did not indicate the sort of response that was under consideration. In normal circumstances the Government's hands are tied because EU nationals are largely entitled to live and work anywhere in the single market. Restrictions: Mrs May suggested emergency border controls are being drawn up . But she said the Government was 'looking at the trends' on immigration from struggling European economies. She said there was no evidence of increased migration at present, she added that it was 'difficult to say how it is going to develop in coming weeks'. Asked whether emergency immigration controls are under consideration, Mrs May said: 'It is right that we do some contingency planning on this (and) that is work that is ongoing.' Prime Minister David Cameron cast doubt on the future of the euro last week when he warned the eurozone that it 'either has to make up or it is looking at a potential break-up'. 'That's the choice they have to make and it is a choice they can't long put off,' he told the Commons. Deepening crisis: Greece has been hit by bouts of civil disorder in recent months with many predicting they will leave the euro at the start of next year . Christine Lagarde, the head of the International Monetary Fund today took an uncompromising hard line with Greece, saying it was time for it to pay its debts. In an interview with the Guardian the managing director of the IMF said she had more sympathy with children in Africa than those in Greece, where people were 'trying to escape tax all the time'. Asked whether she worried about the economic and social impact of austerity in the Mediterranean country, she told the paper: 'No, I think more of the little kids from a school in a little village in Niger who get teaching two hours a day, sharing one chair for three of them, and who are very keen to get an education. 'I have them in my mind all the time. Because I think they need even more help than the people in Athens.' She added: 'Do you know what? As far as Athens is concerned, I also think about all those people who are trying to escape tax all the time. 'All these people in Greece who are trying to escape tax.'","Fears millions of Greeks will lose their jobs and be forced to search for work abroad .

"The Manchester United defence that finished the derby against Manchester City on Sunday was ‘the worst you’ll ever see’ according to Jamie Redknapp. Redknapp, speaking on Sky Sports after the game, said Louis van Gaal’s side should take confidence from the way they finished the game, despite losing 1-0 to their city rivals. But Sportsmail's columnist also criticised the defensive players on show, with United finishing with two midfielders and two teengers in their back-line. Manchester United players look dejected after Sergio Aguero struck City's winner in the second-half . Jamie Redknapp, speaking on Sky Sports, labelled United's defence at the end 'the worst you'll ever see' After Chris Smalling's red card, Michael Carrick had to return from injury at centre back for United . Redknapp and the rest of the Sky Sports panel were impressed in the way the United side finished the game . ‘Look at the back four they ended up with,’ said Redknapp. ‘Valencia, McNair,Carrick and Shaw. That's the back four for Manchester United. That's the worst back four you'll ever see!’ McNair, 19, came on when Marcos Rojo dislocated his shoulder, and allowed Sergio Aguero to escape him for City’s winning goal. And the teenager is likely to have to continue in the United first team, after it was confirmed that Rojo will be out for some time, leaving Untied without a fit centre half. Paddy McNair, up against Fernandinho at a set-piece, replaced the injured Marcos Rojo in defence . City meanwhile will take confidence from the win, after a 10 days which saw them draw with CSKA Moscow before losing to West Ham and Newcastle. Sky pundit Graeme Souness said the result was huge in City’s title defence, but questioned their star players’ temperaments over the past couple of weeks. ‘Forget the derby, that was such a big game in terms of them winning the league again, winning that today,’ he said. ‘And that will give them another bit of confidence that they badly need.’ Manchester United defender Luke Shaw can't hide his frustration as his side fall to a derby defeat on Sunday . ‘Getting beat is part of football, but you bounce back immediately. When you lose you want to be back the next day playing. Well City had a bad result in Russia, against West Ham, against Newcastle. ‘BIg players don't react like that. They should be better than that.

Wenger believes the way his team continued to stay positive despite the frustrations of seeing Burnley goalkeeper Tom Heaton pull off a string of saves and the defenders make last-gasp blocks has them moving in the right direction again. The summer signing's battling qualities have seen him compared to former Liverpool man Luis Suarez . 'In the recent games at home we were not patient and we have learned. We look a bit more balanced between offence and defence,' said manager Wenger, whose side are now fourth, above West Ham on goal difference, but still nine points off leaders Chelsea. 'We were less in trouble when we lost the ball, we were serious and that is very important in the efficiency.' With the return of England international Theo Walcott, who made a late cameo after 10 months out with a serious knee injury, Wenger will soon have plenty of more attacking options. France forward Olivier Giroud is also set to be in contention following the next international break after recovering earlier than expected from a broken foot. The Chilean forward tucks away his second goal of the afternoon to cap a great performance against Burnley . 'For Theo it must be great as well to see that everybody wants him to come on,' said Wenger, who could give Walcott another run out on Tuesday night in the Champions League against Anderlecht when midfielder Jack Wilshere is expected to be available again after a minor knee problem. 'Lukas Podolski also played very well after he came on, he could have scored two. 'When you think that we have not got a number of offensive players like Ozil, Wilshere and Giroud, there is a lot of competition in the forward positions.' While Wenger may feel his squad is now moving in the right direction, there remain more questions than answers for Burnley boss Sean Dyche. Sanchez has now scored 10 goals since moving to Arsenal from Barcelona in the summer . However, with home matches coming up against the likes of Hull, Aston Villa and Newcastle, spirits within the Clarets camp remain high that illusive first top-flight win will come sooner rather than later to lift them off the foot of the table. 'There has to be a future on what you do. You can't rely on a lucky win, or another one because you are never going to improve and build a team,' said Dyche. 'You have to build it by method and ours is reasonably sound, but we are coming up against teams who are of a higher level, and there is no negative in that.'","Alexis Sanchez scored twice as Arsenal beat Burnley 3-0 .

"Alan Pardew is the toast of Tyneside after Newcastle’s resurgence extended to four straight wins – and the manager was even planning a rare night on the town. The 53-year-old was left clinging to his job after a run of seven games without victory from the start of the season. One website – SackPardew.com – even attempted to mobilise fans to protest against his employment. But the 1-0 triumph over Liverpool marked a third win on the spin in the Premier League and came on the back of the midweek success at Manchester City in the League Cup. VIDEOS Scroll down to watch . Newcastle manager Alan Pardew celebrates as his side beat Liverpool 1-0 at St James' Park . Ayoze Perez scored the only goal for the Magpies in a result which takes them to four straight wins . Perez is a player that has excited Newcastle fans, and Pardew praised his player after the match . Fans even held a ‘BackPardew.com’ banner in support of their boss, and Pardew, who celebrates four years at the club next month, reflected: ‘If you are Newcastle manager it is not all gin and tonics and aperitifs. There will be rough days. ‘We have had a long four years. We have had some success and some of that has got forgotten, but I have always enjoyed it here. ‘I love the city and I enjoy the job. I would like to think I am coming out of this a better manager. It has been interesting and educational. It tests you, this football club, on a number of levels. ‘But our fans are brilliant. It will be fantastic in the town tonight. I might even go in myself – for the first time for a while. Pardew (left) pumps his fists as Newcastle take the lead, while Brendan Rodgers looks on in dismay .

When it does not go well they let you know and when it is going well, they let you know - you take the good with the bad.’ And Pardew praised goalscorer Ayoze Perez, the £1.5million summer signing from Tenerife who was also last weekend’s match-winner at Spurs and collected two individual awards in Spain earlier this week. ‘He has a knack,’ he said. ‘He has a lot to learn about the English Premier League but you know that if something falls for him he will score. ‘You sometimes get a player who can do it in training but not on a matchday, but he has had a fabulous week. Two awards in Spanish football and a great week here.’","Newcastle beat Liverpool 1-0 at St James' Park on Saturday .

"Manchester City held on to win the bragging rights in their local derby as Sergio Aguero's 10th league goal of the season proved to be the difference at the Etihad Stadium. Chris Smalling was sent off for Manchester United in the first-half but Louis van Gaal's side applied themselves during a fiercely competitive game. Here, Sportsmail's Laurie Whitwell gives his verdict on how the players performed at the Etihad Stadium on Sunday afternoon. MANCHESTER CITY (4-4-2) Joe Hart - 7 . Fortunate to avoid reprimand when he touched heads with referee Michael Oliver in arguing an appeal. Saved well with his foot from Van Persie and superbly from Di Maria to ensure win. Manchester City stopper Joe Hart's clearance is blocked by Chris Smalling during the clash on Sunday . Pablo Zabaleta - 6 . Should have been carded for lunge on Van Persie and blazed over chance in second half. Did receive a yellow for diving in on Rooney in the second period. Vincent Kompany - 6.5 . Vocal as ever in organising the City defence and couple of tackles to catch the eye but lost Fellaini twice at set piece to allow the Belgian headers in the closing stages. Martin Demichelis - 7 . Excellent distribution, with one ball to Milner particularly good, and rarely appeared ruffled. The only exception being his mistimed slide on Di Maria to earn him a yellow. Gael Clichy - 6.5 . In the main coped admirably against Di Maria and offered plenty going forwards, providing the killer cross for Aguero’s deciding goal. Jesus Navas - 7.5 . An electric presence on the right wing for City and repeatedly troubled Shaw with darts round the outside. Hit the post with a good chance in the second half. Midfielder Yaya Toure gestures to the officials during the Manchester derby on Sunday afternoon . Yaya Toure - 7.5 . Delivered the pass that unlocked United’s makeshift defence, slipping a ball of perfect weight and direction to Clichy. Still not his barnstorming best but getting there. Fernando - 6.5 . Brought in to add stability but also showed his class with a cross for Aguero early on. But got a little swamped by United’s resurgence in the second period and got a booking. James Milner - 7.5 . Offered strong protection defensively down the left but also a creative spark. Drew foul from Smalling that saw him sent off. Star striker Sergio Aguero fired in his 10th league goal of the season so far to put Manchester City ahead . Sergio Aguero - 8 . A buzzing presence as usual from the first whistle and finished his goal superbly, gaining space with smart movement. Not happy when hooked by Pellegrini late on. Stevan Jovetic - 6.5 . Offered a good foil for his strike partner on his first start since August. Tired towards the end and was replaced. Stevan Jovetic challenges Chris Smalling in the air during the first-half at the Etihad Stadium on Sunday . SUBSTITUTES: . Samir Nasri (On for Milner 70') - 5 . Added verve but little defensive assistance. Edin Dzeko (On for Jovetic 71') - 5 . Should have done better with a chance. Fernandinho (On for Aguero 83')- 5 . Manchester United keeper David de Gea made a number of key saves against their local rivals on Sunday . MANCHESTER UNITED (4-1-4-1) David de Gea - 7.5 . Once again United’s best player. Razor reflexes to keep out Navas’s early shot that was heading high into the net and brave to leap at the feet of Aguero as he bore down on goal. Antonio Valencia - 4.5 . Performed like a right-winger operating at right-back. Uncertain of his positioning so consistenly left holes for City to exploit. No surprise City’s opener came from that flank. Chris Smalling - 2     Dereliction of duty to get sent off in the manner he did in a game of this importance. His two yellow cards were dumb and dumber. Utter stupidity from the grammar school graduate. Manchester United right back Antonio Valencia attempts to keep up with City striker Aguero . Chris Smalling looks devastated after being shown the red card after a rash challenge on James Milner . Marcos Rojo - 4 . Extremely lucky to escape the red card that would have followed if referee Oliver had spotted his foul as last man on Toure. Looked suspect until he did eventually depart early with a nasty shoulder injury. Luke Shaw - 6.5 . Racing Navas down the wing will get even the fittest player puffing his cheeks but coped well by and large. Growing into the left-back United paid all that money for. Marouane Fellaini - 7 . Begun the match with a Zidane turn, should have conceded a penalty with a clip on Aguero, added grit to attacks, but missed a glorious chance for an equaliser with his header. Belgium international Marouane Fellaini distributes the ball at the Etihad, trying to start another United attack . Daley Blind - 5.5 . Guilty of giving away possession too often and lack of pace was exploited by City’s speed on the break. Booked for a foul on Toure. Wayne Rooney - 7.5 . Performance for the team, playing first in midfield then out wide and a constant source of motivation. Set up Di Maria chance with superb run from deep. Manchester United captain Wayne Rooney, tackling Stevan Jovetic, played in midfield at the Etihad Stadium . Adnan Januzaj - 6 . Sparkled on occasion in the early stages but failed to impose himself greatly and understandably the man sacrificed when United went down to 10 men. Angel di Maria - 7 . Drew lunging fouls from Demichelis and Fernando that earned both bookings and his energy was major factor in United ending the match in the ascendancy. Record signing Angel di Maria leaps over a heavy challenge from Manchester City captain Vincent Kompany . Robin van Persie - 6 . Did excellently to craft his only chance by dribbling past Clichy to shoot from a tight angle but does not possess enough mobility to function as focal point for counter-attacks. SUBSTITUTES: . Michael Carrick (On for Januzaj 43’) - 6.5 . Coped well as emergency centre-back playing for the first time in six months. Paddy McNair (On for Rojo 55') - 5 Allowed Aguero to escape for the winner. James Wilson (On for Van Persie 82') - 5 .","Incident packed first-half ended 0-0 as Chris Smalling was sent off .

"The League Cup semi-final draw was met with roars of delight from both the Celtic and Rangers squads after the first Old Firm derby in three seasons was confirmed. Celtic striker Anthony Stokes admitted his team-mates had made their feelings clear when news filtered through to their dressing room after the 1-0 Premiership win over Inverness at Parkhead. The cries of celebration were audible from outside as the numbers of Dundee United and Aberdeen appeared first out of the hat. Gary Hooper completed the scoring during Celtic's 3-0 win over Rangers in the last Old Firm derby in 2012 . Celtic players celebrate during their 3-0 win over rivals Rangers back in April 2012 in the Scottish Premiership . There was an identical reaction to the last-four match-up from the Rangers players in the aftermath of their 1-0 victory at Dumbarton in the Scottish Cup. Stokes’ joy at landing an ‘epic’ League Cup semi-final was clear. The Glasgow rivals will now meet at Hampden in three months’ time, with the game scheduled for either Saturday January 31 or Sunday February 1 — the latter date looking more likely. The news overshadowed John Guidetti’s latest winning goal for Celtic and the build-up will begin now for a fixture not played since April 2012. ‘We just watched it downstairs and there were a few cheers,’ said Stokes of the draw. ‘Being realistic, it was the draw everyone wanted — fans, ourselves. It will be a tough game. I think everyone misses the rivalry. Ally McCoist's Rangers, in action against Hearts, are currently playing in the Scottish Championship . Celtic players celebrate their impressive 6-0 win over Partick Thistle in the League Cup on Wednesday . ‘I think it will be different to any other Old Firm game because we have gone so long without it.’ Stokes’ excitement at the return of the old fixture was matched by his manager Ronny Deila, who has never experienced an Old Firm match before. With Rangers operating a division below in the Championship, the Norwegian admits his team will go into the tie bearing the weight of expectation. ‘Right now, we are favourites,’ said Deila. ‘We have that in every game in Scotland and we will be favourites against Rangers, unless something special happens in January.’ Deila’s counterpart Ally McCoist agreed with that assessment, adding: ‘I’m delighted with the draw and, judging by the reaction from the boys in the dressing room, they are happier than me.’","Old firm rivals Rangers and Celtic haven't played each other since 2012 .

"Sachin Tendulkar has revealed his ‘shock’ and ‘humiliation’ at being accused of ball tampering on the 2001 tour to South Africa and that he was so upset that he considered leaving the tour. ‘I had a very difficult time when referee Mike Denness alleged that I had been involved in ball tampering. I was shocked because I had always played cricket with integrity and honesty and would never do such a thing,’ he says in his autobiography, Playing It My Way, out on November 6. The celebrated Indian batsman, who scored almost 16,000 Test runs in an international career which ran from 1989 until he retired at the end of last year, says that all he did was to use his thumb to clean off the grass that was stuck on the seam. He insists that he never tampered with the ball. Sachin Tendulkar is carried on his team-mates shoulders after India won the 2011 Cricket World Cup . Tendulkar has always had cricket in his blood, and scored nearly 16,000 runs in his career . Tendulkar (second left) celebrates after India beat Pakistan by 29 runs in March 2011 . ‘None of the umpires had lodged a formal complaint against me and it was humiliating to be labelled a cheat,’ he adds. ‘I wasn’t prepared to let it pass. I informed Mike Denness that I would complain about the allegation and would not keep quiet about it. ‘I was prepared to abandon the tour if need be but wasn’t ready to be labelled a cheat. It was about honour and there was no way I would allow a match referee to cast aspersions on my credibility. ‘Mike Denness’s decisions had led to a crisis that had ended up dividing the cricket world down the middle. It was an avoidable incident and one that left everyone bitter in the end.’ Mumbai-born Tendulkar, 41, also reveals that it was his great love of tennis, particularly watching John McEnroe, which got him started in sport, before a cricket bat replaced his racket and an incredible international career was born. He says he had even considered life as a tennis player. Batsman Tendulkar looks to the sky after scoring a double century against Australia in October 2010 . Tendulkar poses for a photographer during his younger years . Always able to draw a large crowd, the Indian legend is flanked by security guards at Lords . He also claims that there may have been divine intervention in the 1986–87 season, when he scored his first hundred. He was on 94 runs at the close of play and nervous about reaching his first ton the following day. ‘Sensing my anxiety, my father took me to a Ganapati temple in Bandra to seek the blessings of Lord Ganesha and only then did I leave for Shivaji Park. ‘On my way I visited another Ganapati temple, the one I regularly visited before games. There was a water tap inside the temple premises and I regularly used to drink from it before I went to the ground. ‘I did the same that day and in the very first over hit two boundaries to reach my hundred. ‘It was a deeply satisfying moment.’ Extracts with permission of Hodder & Stoughton from Playing It My Way, by Sachin Tendulkar.

"Arsenal midfielder Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain is relishing playing alongside new recruit Alexis Sanchez, and says he is learning a lot from the Chile international. Sanchez, a £30million summer signing from Barcelona, is Arsenal’s top scorer in the Premier League this season with seven goals including two in yesterday’s 3-0 win over Burnley.

And his defensive duties as an attacker, the work he does up front, is something I can learn from as well.’ Arsenal will be hoping the Chilean keeps up his good form as they welcome Belgian side Anderlecht in the Champions League on Tuesday, before travelling to face Swansea in their next Premier League game next Sunday.

"Diego Maradona has been labelled a psychopath after a video emerged appearing to show him assaulting his on-off girlfriend. In the video, Maradona, who captained Argentina to World Cup glory in 1986 before managing the side with less success, can be seen getting up from his sofa and approaching his girlfriend Rocio Oliva to have a go at her for using her mobile. Oliva filmed the 53-year-old walking towards her spluttering: 'You still looking at your phone?' In the video, Maradona can be seen getting up from the sofa and approaching his girlfriend . He is then alleged to have hit her, although he later claimed he had only knocked the phone from her hand . Maradona pictured with 24-year-old Rocio Oliva in June last year. It's believed she secretly recorded the video at his Buenos Aires apartment earlier this month . Maradona captained Argentina to World Cup glory, and is regarded as the country's greatest ever player . She retorted: 'Can't I look at it?' before begging him: 'Stop Diego, calm down, stop hitting.' as he allegedly tried to strike her twice with his right hand. On Monday night Maradona, whose infamous Hand of God goal helped Argentina knock England out of the 1986 World Cup, tried to ride out the storm by insisting he had only knocked the phone out of her hands. He told a journalist: 'I sent the phone flying but I swear I've never hit a woman. The story starts and finishes there. 'I admit I knocked the phone out of Rocio's hands but there's nothing more to it. The situation didn't continue.' Maradona is perhaps best known in England for his notorious 'Hand of God' goal past Peter Shilton . The former Napoli star, widely regarded as one of the greatest players of all time, was put on the defensive after the 30-second video, secretly recorded by his former fiancee, was broadcast on a lunchtime TV programme. It is thought to have been recorded at the star's apartment near Buenos Aires when he returned to Argentina earlier this month after his father was rushed to hospital. He is now back at his home in Dubai without either Oliva or former girlfriend Veronica Ojeda, with whom he has also been romantically linked in recent months despite dumping her when she was four months pregnant with their child Diego Fernando. On Monday night Oliva's aunt branded him a 'psychopath and woman beater'. Maradona led Argentina at the 2010 World Cup but with considerably less success than he had as a player . It is not the first time Maradona has been accused of falling out with the 24-year-old, who he started dating at the beginning of last year after breaking up with Ojeda, 34. In May last year he allegedly had a row with her on a plane. Passengers on board told how the pair exchanged insults and business class travellers, including a politician's wife, and air stewardesses allegedly had to step in to try to get him to calm down. The incident happened as he went to meet his baby son by Veronica Ojeda for the first time. This summer he was also filmed slapping a male journalist he accused of winking at his former girlfriend.","Diego Maradona allegedly hit girlfriend because she was using her phone .

"Former Sheffield Wednesday and Sweden midfielder Klas Ingesson, who played a major role in his country's third-place finish at the 1994 World Cup, has died of cancer at the age of 46. As a player Ingesson represented a string of clubs including Gothenburg in Sweden and the Italian trio of Bolgona, Bari and Lecce before going on to manage Elfsborg in his homeland. Former club Wednesday said in an announcement on their website: 'Sheffield Wednesday are saddened to learn of the passing of Klas Ingesson. Our thoughts are with Klas' family and friends at this very sad time. Former Sheffield Wednesday and Sweden midfielder Klas Ingesson (centre) has died of cancer, aged 46 .

Following treatment he was able to take over Elfsborg's Under 21 side in October 2010, eventually being appointed manager of the senior team in September 2013. But Ingesson's managerial career was interrupted by the return of the cancer and he spent a period coaching from the dugout in a wheelchair before announcing his decision to step down from the role at the end of the season. 'If I'm going to be involved, I have to play a full part,' Ingesson said after stepping down. 'This year I have been there on and off and others have had to bear the burden.

Elfsborg and I have an agreement that I am manager for the first team. 'Physically and mentally I don't have a problem to do my job. I should be judged as anyone else to determine whether I am good enough for the job but then I should be judged on my competence, not my physical status. 'It is every person's right to be judged by who you are and what you do, not because you have an illness or a handicap.'

"Paul Lambert cleared up accusations that Matthew Lowton had a run in with Aston Villa fans at the end of the clash by claiming he was speaking to his wife. Lowton was shown exchanging words after Villa’s 2-0 defeat, but the manager claimed he was speaking with his spouse. The Villa chief said: ‘I have just heard that (about the accusation) but believe it or not his wife was in the crowd and he was telling her to go outside.’ Matthew Lowton gestures to his wife at the final whistle, according to Aston Villa manager Paul Lambert .

From another angle it's evident the lack of communication between Cole and Benteke as Villa waste a chance . Cole and Benteke's attempts to head on target go horribly wrong as they hinder each other's efforts . Lambert was furious with his team for their defending and admitted it could take Christian Benteke up to seven games before he is fully up to speed after six months out through injury. The Villa boss added: ‘The two goals were really poor, but I’m never one for stats because the most important ones are the number of times it is in the back of the net. ‘To come here was always going to be tough. We need to be more clinical,' said Lambert after his side fell to a fifth consecutive defeat and have now failed to score in over 531 minutes of play.

It is a long time out and he might take six or seven games to get up to speed. There are signs that he is getting there. Lambert's team had a 65 per cent majority of the possession but failed to make that count which angered the Villa boss: . ‘It is a physical game, we have to try to win a game of football. We didn’t defend well for their goals. 'We can't have as much of the ball as we did tonight and not win the match. Whatever is said in the dressing room stays there.

"Andy Carroll's footballing career has been hampered by a succession of injuries, but his modelling career is off to a flyer as campaign photos hit New York's Times Square on Monday. The 25-year-old West Ham striker has not scored a Premier League goal for over seven months, and is yet to play a match this season, but is having more luck when it comes to his off-field activities. Carroll was chosen to front a H&M modelling campaign earlier this month after beating off competition from 200 other candidates, and has shown off a whole new set of skills since signing up with agency 'Select Models'. Andy Carroll's Instagram photo shows him on a billboard in New York's Times Square . Carroll returned to first-team training with West Ham last Thursday after an ankle injury . In a photograph posted on his Instagram account from Times Square, Carroll is seen wearing a simple black jumper, while spinning a football on his finger. But football isn't something he has seen a lot of in the past few months, not featuring for the Hammers at all this season after suffering ankle ligament damage on the club's pre-season tour of New Zealand in July. Early reports stated that the England striker could be out until 2015, but he is now expected to make a return as early as November 8 at home to Aston Villa, following an injury to Diafra Sakho. The Senegal-born striker has been a revelation for the east-Londoners this season, scoring seven goals in his first seven starts, but he may have to pass the baton temporarily to Carroll following a shoulder injury picked up on Saturday. West Ham and England striker Carroll fronted a campaign for Alexander Wang for H&M . Carroll has yet to play this season and is currently recovering from knee ligament damage . Carroll, seen here scoring against Sweden at Euro 2012, is hoping to return sooner rather than later . Carroll returned to West Ham training last week, and manager Sam Allardyce spoke of his return shortly after. 'We'll try to get him through three or four behind-closed-doors games and if that goes alright, then we would hope to have him back... hopefully when he gets back he'll have a major impact.' And an impact is exactly what Carroll will need to have, if West Ham are to maintain their extraordinary start to the Premier League season. They have won five of their first nine matches, and are unlikely occupants of a top-four position in the Premier League. Allardyce spoke of his want to involve Carroll in practice matches before promoting him back to the first team, but given Sakho's injury, the West Ham manager's hand may be forced to include him sooner than expected.","Andy Carroll has not played a Premier League match this season .

"Newcastle United have given an insight into what goes on in a Premier League dressing room prior to a match. The Magpies travelled to White Hart Lane to play Tottenham on Sunday afternoon, and in a Vine posted on the club's official Twitter account, fans were shown around the away dressing room before the players arrived to begin their preparations. The video showed a table piled high with players' drinks and snacks, as well as a strangely high volume of toilet roll.

The isotonic gels, made by Science in Sport, provide a quick supply of energy to the player's muscles and is designed to help the team work harder, for longer, during the match. And it seems to have worked, given that the Magpies came away from White Hart Lane with a 1-2 victory. There was just one carton of Brake's '100% Juice', apple flavour, and twenty packs of spearmint chewing gum for the players to enjoy. As with the majority of professional football clubs, the players were free to take Lucozade Sport drinks - orange flavour - as well as a supermarket own brand blue isotonic drink, which will have been picked up for 40p a piece.

The 66-year-old, known as Vernon, said he heard a 'crack' and was hit in the head when he accidentally got caught up in the disturbance in the main square. Scroll down for video . John Vernon Thomas was hit in the head by a suspected rubber bullet during the clashes in Lille, France . Police with shields dispersed Everton fans from Lille square using tear gas canisters as flares were released . He said: 'It hit me right on the temple. I went down in a bit of a shock. Another two inches it would have gone to my eyes. I am lucky to be here. It was a nasty attack. It took the wind out of me.' Mr Thomas was taken to hospital and kept in overnight after being told his injuries were life threatening. He added: 'There was blood pouring out. I don't know if it was a rubber bullet or what. It was like being punched by Mike Tyson. People have said that I was in the wrong place at the wrong time.' Mr Thomas, a season ticket holder, was forced to miss the match the next day. Mr Thomas said had the suspected rubber bullet hit him nearer to his eye he could have been killed or blinded . Clashes broke out in the main square in Lille last Thursday ahead of the game and led to Everton fans being dispersed with tear gas. Flares were set off and riot police moved through a group of fans, with shields covering their bodies, and released tear gas bombs. Rubber bullets are also thought to have been used. Fans were left rubbing their eyes and sneezing, and they attempted to flee the scene as bottles flew across the square. Around 7,000 fans had travelled from the UK to Lille for the match. French riot police stand in formation at the Grand Palace in main square in Lille last week . Mr Thomas, a grandfather, had to spend a night in hospital after he was hit in the temple by the bullet . Police have insisted the 44m rubber bullets, as well as tear gas canisters, had been used by riot police in 'self-defence' after bottles were thrown at them. The incident was apparently triggered after plain-clothes police tried to arrest a suspected football hooligan. The man had been previously spotted by a Merseyside Police officer travelling with Blues (Everton) fans. He was later released by French police and allowed to return home without charge. At the same time a French football hooligan who was among thugs who stormed a bar where Everton fans were drinking was jailed. Blues fans came under attack from up to 100 people the night before the match took place. The incident came the day after several Everton fans were injured after an ambush by a group of 50 people, wearing masks and wielding metal chairs outside a pub on Wednesday evening. Two fans suffered minor injuries. A suspected Lille 'ultra' - known only as Tomasz S - was arrested on Thursday after being recognised by police. The 30-year-old appeared in court on Friday and was jailed for eight months.","John Vernon Thomas was on first trip abroad to see Everton play in Lille .

"West Ham are famous for their 'I'm Forever Blowing Bubbles' chant at Upton Park, but the lyrics needed changing on Saturday afternoon after the bubble machine started blowing smoke instead. Prior to kick-off in West Ham's Premier League clash with Manchester City, a member of stadium staff was seen desperately attempting to fix the broken machine, after it started emitting smoke. His attempt at rescuing the machine appears to have worked though, as normal service was resumed when the players walked onto the pitch - bubbles and all.

All of a sudden Leicester find themselves in a spot of bother and luck hasn’t been given a squad number. That much was obvious two minutes into the second half when, having dominated the first 45 minutes, it all went calamitously wrong.

City’s demolition of Manchester United seems a long time ago now, with their subsequent five games yielding four defeats and a draw. The drama is not quite a crisis but the poor run is enough to worry manager Nigel Pearson. ‘You could argue we were slightly unlucky,’ he said. ‘We are in a difficult run at the moment. I have belief in the group we have but we need consistent performances that allow us to compete in games.’ That is proving easier said than done, though for inspiration Pearson might have stolen a glance at West Brom’s bench. Alan Irvine was subjected to quite absurd abuse from elements of the club’s support when he was appointed in the summer, but a run of one defeat in six Premier League games serves as a vindication. ‘I am absolutely delighted with the result,’ said Irvine, whose much-changed side were dumped out of the Capital One Cup by Bournemouth on Tuesday. ‘I will take goals like that. It was fortunate the way it went in.’ He added: ‘I am not satisfied with what happened on Tuesday — I am still hurting about that. But the fact is that had we played the same team on Tuesday as last weekend, we would have risked problems at the end of this game. ‘We needed players who were physically and mentally ready to cope and they did really well.’ For Pearson, at the very least it was a vast improvement on their offering, or more specifically their application, in last weekend’s defeat at Swansea. At the Liberty Stadium, they lacked intensity and any kind of sharp edge. Here, with four changes to the side that lost 2-0 in Wales, including the injury-demotion of Leonardo Ulloa to the bench, only one of those factors was an issue.

Leicester manager Nigel Pearson and West Brom counterpart Alan Irvine observe the minutes silence for Remembrance Day . Leicester City captain Morgan battles for the ball with West Brom's in-form striker Berahino at the King Power Stadium . MINS PLD    KM    MILES .

Craig Gardner                90          11.6      7.2 . Chris Brunt                     90          11.5      7.1 . But how many games will you win when only five of 14 shots hit the target — and too few of those troubling the keeper? Within three minutes, Andy King had a free header inside the six-yard box. It travelled weakly into Ben Foster’s arms. Danny Drinkwater then ballooned over the bar. West Brom almost capitalised moments later but Berahino followed a moment of quick thinking with slow feet. Having beaten Marcin Wasilewski’s offside trap, he dallied and let the defender get a block in. Leicester’s Jamie Vardy was then brought down by Joleon Lescott but Stuart Attwell, refereeing his first Premier League fixture since 2012, refused to point to the spot. More blatant was Sebastien Pocognoli’s hold on Vardy at a corner soon after, which also went unpunished, as did Wasilewski’s second-half elbow on Berahino. That latter incident looked bad, even if Irvine said he had no problems with it, having not seen a replay. The real sucker punch came in the 47th minute when Chris Brunt threaded a pass to Berahino. The 21-year-old hit a low cross from the left and Morgan headed against Cambiasso, who nudged the ball past Kasper Schmeichel. Ulloa, who had been struggling with a groin problem, came on with 22 minutes remaining and nearly saved his side with a cross from the right that King headed straight at Foster.

"Manchester United welcome Chelsea to Old Trafford on Sunday in what is Louis van Gaal’s first test against one of last season’s top four. United have invested heavily over the summer in a bid to bridge that gap but the early signs are that there is still some way to go. Here, Sportsmail looks at the two squads and brings you our composite XI in a 4-2-3-1 formation… . Louis van Gaal (left) will face his first test against one of last season's top four in the Premier League as his Manchester United side go head-to-head with Chelsea and Jose Mourinho at Old Trafford on Sunday . GOALKEEPER – Thibaut Courtois . The Belgian is already widely considered the division’s best stopper, and this after just eight matches back at Stamford Bridge. David de Gea, of course, rivals Courtois for that mantle, but it is the Chelsea custodian who gets the nod. Thibaut Courtois has claimed the Chelsea No 1 jersey from Petr Cech this year and deserves his place . David de Gea is unlucky not to make the side after some wonderful displays for Manchester United . RIGHT BACK – Branislav Ivanovic . The Serb is everything you want in a full back - he is powerful, pacey, combative and classy. It isn’t really a contest as to whether he or Rafael gets the vote. Branislav Ivanovic (left) easily gets the nod ahead of Manchester United's Rafael for the right-back slot . CENTRE BACK – John Terry . The Chelsea captain continues to deliver week in, week out. He may have lost half a yard of pace, but he more than makes allowance with his cunning, leadership and will to win. Terry is exactly what United need. John Terry leads from the front for the Blues and he is exactly what United are missing at the back right now . CENTRE BACK – Gary Cahill . He is England’s No 1 centre back and sets the standard to which the likes of Phil Jones and Chris Smalling must strive. Again, how United could do with him at the back right now. Gary Cahill (left) is England's first-choice centre back and he is picked ahead of Phil Jones and Chris Smalling . Phil Jones (left) and Chris Smalling are yet to grow into the players they were expected to become in defence . LEFT BACK – Cesar Azpilicueta . He is simply a very good defender, and had to be to keep Ashley Cole out of the side last season. Luke Shaw remains unconvincing in United’s colours, while Marcos Rojo has been deployed at centre back. Cesar Azpilicueta kept Ashley Cole out of the Chelsea team last season and is an excellent defender . CENTRAL MIDFIELD – Nemanja Matic . The big Serb is the best at his trade in the Premier League, protecting his back four but also boasting the creativity to spring offensives at the other end. Daley Blind has some way to go before he is considered in Matic’s class. Nemanja Matic (right) is the best defensive midfielder in the league and gets picked ahead of Daley Blind . CENTRAL MIDFIELD – Cesc Fabregas . Why didn’t United try to sign him? They were crying out for an experienced midfielder of Fabregas’ proven quality. He is already making a difference at Chelsea. Cesc Fabregas (right) is already making the difference at Chelsea and United should have signed him up . ATTACKING MIDFIELD – Angel di Maria . At last, a United entry. In fact, it would be difficult to keep Di Maria out of any side in the world right now. He has hit the ground sprinting at Old Trafford and, without him, they would be residing a lot lower than sixth in the table. Angel di Maria is the only United player in the composite XI - but he would get into any side in the world . ATTACKING MIDFIELD – Eden Hazard . The Belgian is fast maturing into the player we all hoped he would be, consistently delivering rather than showing us the odd flash of genius. He is a joy to watch and makes it all look so effortless. Hazard makes the side ahead of former team-mate Juan Mata. Eden Hazard is maturing into a class act and he is regularly putting in top-class performances now . Wayne Rooney (left) and Juan Mata have not shown the form of Chelsea's attacking-midfield trio this season . ATTACKING MIDFIELD – Oscar . Now this final attacking-midfield berth was the hardest call on the pitch, but it is the much-improved Brazilian who wins his place ahead of Wayne Rooney and Mata. Oscar is marrying graft to his craft and has won the trust of Jose Mourinho. Oscar (right) just gets the nod in attacking midfield ahead of Wayne Rooney and former team-mate Juan Mata . STRIKER – Diego Costa . The brutal brilliance of the Spain international has taken Chelsea to another level this season and, should he stay fit, they will win the league. At United, Robin van Persie is horribly out of form, while Falcao has not adapted in the manner of Costa to the Premier League. Diego Costa (right) has taken to the Premier League extremely quickly and is banging in the goals .

"Click here for Sportsmail's brilliant Match Zone from Everton's draw with Swansea . Swansea manager Garry Monk allowed himself a wry smile just 24 hours after clear-the-air talks with refereeing bosses Mike Riley and Howard Webb. His influential midfielder, Jonjo Shelvey, had just been sent off and his side were also denied a clear penalty. Monk, 35, is the Premier League’s youngest manager but he certainly is not backward in coming forwards. He met Riley and Webb on Friday two weeks after a ‘cheat’ outburst against Stoke City’s Victor Moses and then professed himself satisfied with the chat. Swansea midfielder Jonjo Shelvey trudges disconsolately off of the Goodison Park pitch after being dismissed in the second half . The former Liverpool midfielder was booed off the pitch by the Everton fans after he was sent off for a second yellow card . Everton: (4-2-3-1): Howard 6; Coleman 6.5, Alcaraz 5 (Besic 32' 6), Jagielka 6, Baines 6; Barry 6.5, McCarthy 7.5; McGeady 7 (Lukaku 68' 6), Naismith 6 (Pienaar 68' 5.5), Barkley 6; Eto'o 5.5 . Subs (not used): Robles, Hibbert,  Atsu, Osman. Booked: Barry, Besic .

Booked: Bony, Williams, Sigurdsson . Sent off: Shelvey . Referee: Kevin Friend 6 . Attendance: 39,149 . ‘I had a good meeting with Mike and Howard and got a bit of clarification,’ he said. ‘We were having a lot of wrong decisions in a short period that was hurting us.’ On Saturday's two major talking points, Monk did not offer any defence on behalf of Shelvey, who received a yellow card for foolishly kicking the ball away and then a second for grappling with James McCarthy as the Everton midfielder burst towards the penalty area. But he was incredulous that Antolin Alcaraz’s handball to block Shelvey’s shot in the first half had not been spotted by referee Kevin Friend. ‘I didn’t know you could play with two goalkeepers,’ he smiled. ‘He [Alcaraz] actually saved the ball. It was a good strong wrist. I’ll be showing my goalkeepers that’s how you do it. It was a clear penalty. ‘I’m not particularly complaining about the sending off. You can’t kick the ball away for the first yellow, it is something he [Shelvey] needs to learn from. But the way things are going for us at the moment, any time we make contact on a yellow card, it then becomes a red. ‘But we have to help ourselves get over the periods where the odd 50-50 goes against us. And we did that today — defensively we were brilliant.’ Roberto Martinez cut his managerial teeth at Swansea and set down the template for slick passing and good attacking movement. But after managerial stints by Brendan Rodgers and Michael Laudrup, Monk, a former centre-half, has improved Swansea’s defensive qualities . He was proud of the way his players threw their bodies in the path of the ball on countless occasions to block out an Everton side trying to make their extra man count in the final 18 minutes. ‘I’ve played in many Swansea teams that played attractive football but sometimes we didn’t do enough work defensively. It is something I brought in. There are times where we can’t play free-flowing football and if we hadn’t done that work on our shape, we would have lost games like this.’ Martinez was not flattering about what he saw from his former club.

It was strange to see them play like that.’ It smacked of our sour grapes and perhaps Martinez is concerned his own side have just one Premier League win at Goodison Park this season. True, Swansea did not have a shot on target but they deserved a penalty and had the game’s clearest chance when Wilfried Bony shot wide after being put clean through by Gylfi Sigurdsson.

They did press more right at the end but Romelu Lukaku, on the bench until the final quarter, inadvertently blocked Baines’s shot in added time and then failed to get a touch on a Samuel Eto’o cross. ‘The way we moved the ball wasn’t quick enough,’ admitted the Everton manager. ‘Swansea defended well, you have to give them credit. But we had bad fortune, too. Leighton had a good angle at the end but his shot hit Romelu’s legs.’ Martinez was also disappointed to see Alcaraz leave the action clutching his shoulder. He faces another prolonged spell on the sidelines after falling badly as he challenged Bony in the air. ‘He has damaged his joint in the shoulder and he is going to be out for a long spell. It is a real negative for us,’ said Martinez. Shelvey, 22, might have feared he had cost his side the game when he was ordered off 18 minutes from the end. He has already picked up 22 bookings and two red cards in his short career and, as an ex-Liverpool player, he was booed all the way to the dressing-room by Everton fans. But his team-mates did him proud as they kept Everton at bay. Martinez said: ‘I’m disappointed as I thought it was going to be more of a spectacle but it didn’t turn out to be. I thought we were a little frustrated.’ Thanks to his players’ resilience, Monk could afford to let the officials off this time. ‘I have just told my players they will never win a harder-earned point,’ he said.

"Chelsea star Eden Hazard and Andre Schurrle appear in relaxed form ahead of Sunday's massive game at Old Trafford. German midfielder Schurrle posted a selfie of the duo on the team plane en route to Manchester on Saturday evening as Jose Mourinho's side look to continue their unbeaten start to the Premier League season. Both players are set to play key roles against Louis van Gaal's men with Schurrle tipped to play centre forward in the absence of injured strikers Diego Costa and Loic Remy. Andrew Schurrle and Eden Hazard appear in relaxed form on the Chelsea team's flight to Manchester . Belgian star Hazard scored a brace in Chelsea's midweek Champions League rout of Maribor and has been in excellent form for the Blues. Mourinho takes his Chelsea side to Old Trafford on Sunday shunning the conservative approach to instead chase a victory over Manchester United. Mourinho will play against one-time mentor Van Gaal for the second time in competitive matches, bidding to build on the Blues' seven wins in eight Premier League matches so far this season. Hazard scored twice for Chelsea in their 6-0 rout of Maribor in the Champions League on Monday night . Last season, just three games into his second spell as Chelsea boss, Mourinho opted against fielding a recognised striker at Old Trafford. This time Chelsea travel with a win on their minds. 'Try (for) the best result as always,' Mourinho said. German forward Schurlle could be deployed at centre forward against Manchester United at Old Trafford . 'Try to play as good as we are playing and we are always trying to play, respecting an opponent that is one of the best and most difficult in the Premier League. 'We are confident, we are in a good moment, in a good situation and there is no reason for us to change our feeling. 'We play against a big team, yes, we know that, but we feel ourselves in a very good moment.' Diego Costa is still unavailable for Chelsea as the Spain striker recovers from hamstring problems . Mourinho is prepared to risk the fitness of striker Diego Costa, who has scored nine goals in seven Premier League games and is recovering from a hamstring problem and viral infection. Loic Remy (groin) is out, while midfielders John Obi Mikel (foot) and Ramires (groin) could return alongside forward Andre Schurrle (illness). Thibaut Courtois is to return in goal after Petr Cech started Tuesday night's match against Maribor and Filipe Luis is likely to play at left-back with Cesar Azpilicueta suspended. Cesc Fabregas, who was linked with United in recent seasons, has been key to Chelsea's form this term since signing from Barcelona. But Mourinho is confident his side can adapt if United try to shut down the Spain playmaker, just as Crystal Palace tried last weekend. The Blues boss added: 'If he doesn't run (the game), somebody runs it.

"Click here to see our brilliant Match Zone, including Victor Wanyama's wonder-strike for Southampton . An early blunder by third-choice Hull keeper Eldin Jakupovic and a moment of opportunism from Victor Wanyama were the decisive factors as Southampton maintained their extraordinary start to the season. Jakupovic failed to deal effectively with a back-pass, hitting it to Wanyama who, in turn, lobbed it back from distance, over the keeper’s head and into the net. So Southampton go marching on — with 10 wins in their last 11 games in all competitions and playing as solidly at the back as they are threateningly going forward. Victor Wanyama's first-time effort from 40 yards out gave Southampton an early lead at the KC Stadium .

Ronald Koeman’s side have not conceded a League goal in more than six hours, or 320 minutes to be exact, and have let in fewer top-flight goals (in total, five; and per game, half) than any other side in England, in any division. ‘And now you’re gonna believe us, we’re gonna win the League!’ sang the 1,479 jubilant Southampton fans in attendance. Indeed. Nobody is going to believe them but this has been a wonderful start to the season and this latest victory made the 254-mile journey home much more pleasant for the travelling support. Koeman was asked about the fans’ singing. ‘Maybe, maybe,’ he said when asked if his side could really win the title, but he did so with a big grin. ‘But no,’ he added. Then: ‘If we continue moving up the table, why not?’ This was Southampton’s third win in eight days following two victories over Stoke, at home in the League last week then away in the Capital One Cup, booking a quarter-final berth in that competition. ‘I’m proud of my players, a third win in a week is not easy,’ Koeman said. ‘I’m surprised a bit by how many points we have, but I’m not surprised by the quality of the team … we work hard on the composition of the team.’ Asked about European aspirations, he added: ‘You never know … but everyone knows we have to work hard every day. The spirit is incredible and we have to keep it.’ His counterpart, Steve Bruce, said: ‘That was a very difficult game for us. Southampton are a very, very good side and it’s no fluke they’re at the top of the division. ‘We weren’t quite there today … it was a great finish from Wanyama, but you make a mistake like that and you’re on your heels.’ Wanyama's 40-yard effort as illustrated by our brilliant Match Zone.

Wanyama was one of two changes Koeman made to the side that started against Stoke last Saturday. Wanyama starting in place of Jack Cork in midfield and Shane Long started in place of Sadio Mane. Wanyama’s all-round play was excellent, as good as it has been since his £12.5 million move from Celtic in summer 2013. The crowd — including England manager Roy Hodgson — were barely in their seats when the visitors went ahead inside three minutes. If we want to be generous, the goal was not all Jakupovic’s fault. The Yugoslavia-born Swiss international would not have been playing without injuries to Allan McGregor and Steve Harper. Jakupovic was then put under some pressure by a backpass from Robbie Brady. The weight of the ball was not good and Jakupovic was forced to move out of his goal to make sure that he got to it before Graziano Pelle, running the channel to try and pick it up. Jakupovic did get there first, but instead of kicking the ball hard and out of play — as would probably have been best — he hoofed it not very hard out of his area — to Wanyama. The Kenyan had a look up to see Jakupovic well out of position and smashed the ball it first time from about 40 yards into the net. So the goal was a product of Brady’s poor play, and Wanyama’s skill. But yes, it was still a howler. And yes, .

"Erik Lamela’s 20-yard rabona against Asteras Tripolis on Thursday night was an ostentatious display of genius that took the breath away and had manager Mauricio Pochettino proclaiming it the best goal ever scored by one of his players. It was, said Pochettino, a goal that could only have been scored by a player of Lamela’s skill. Long time supporters of the Argentine recognised the technique. There is grainy footage on YouTube of him scoring from a rabona as a young teenager, playing in a junior game for River Plate in his homeland. Erik Lamela's astonishing rabona strike put Tottenham Hotspur in control against Asteras Tripolis . Spurs boss Mauricio Pochettino gives Lamela a pat on the back after his goalscoring exploits . Lamela's incredible strike doubled Tottenham's lead against the visitors as they went on to win 5-1 . But what is the wider history of the rabona? It is defined as striking the ball when the kicking leg is wrapped around the back of the standing leg - effectively with one's legs crossed. Particularly popular among players of South American origin, the first rabona was scored in 1948 by striker Ricardo Infante in a game between Argentinian teams Estudiantes de la Plata and Rosario Central. But it was Italian winger Giovanni Roccotelli who made the showboating act his own and later became revered as 'il padre della rabona,’ or ‘the father of the rabona’. An even younger Lamela for River Plate's youth team runs through with just the goalkeeper to beat . The now-Tottenham Hotspur midfielder goes for the 'rabona' strike over the on-rushing goalkeeper . When interviewed in the 1990s Roccotelli said: ‘In every game the fans begged me to do it, they expected it. For me it was a natural thing. 'I began crossing like this when I was very little. At least I did one thing before all the others. 'Now they call this move ""rabona"" because Ronaldo did it, but Pele himself said in an interview that he remembered an Italian doing it before him: that was me.’ Angel di Maria performs his trademark trick during the World Cup in Brazil for Argentina in June . Marcos Rojo performs the rabona during the World Cup group stage match against Bosnia-Herzegovina . Ronaldo and Pele perfected the technique but we could be seeing plenty more rabona in the Premier League this season. Manchester United new boys Marcos Rojo and particularly Angel di Maria are renowned for their sublime rabona kicks. Di Maria performs rabona kicks to pass and score, while Rojo even employed a rabona to clear his own penalty area in a World Cup match for Argentina against Bosnia-Herzegovina this summer. England legend Paul Gascoigne performs the rabona in 1991 as he dons the Three Lions jersey . Luis Suarez ademonstrated against West Brom that his skill matches the best when he performed a rabona . PS. Don’t try this trick if you’ve not already nailed it on the training ground. Yes, we’re looking at you David Dunn. The Birmingham midfielder attempted a rabona pass in a match against Aston Villa. He embarrassingly got the ball caught between his legs and ended up in an messy pile in the middle of the pitch, in a move replayed millions of times on the internet and one which Dunn is surely reminded of at regular intervals.","Erik Lamela scored a rabona goal from 20 yards for Tottenham Hotspur .

"Sergio Aguero did not turn up to a charity event on Friday where he was scheduled to meet young fans alongside Manchester derby participants Angel Di Maria, Pablo Zabaleta and Marcos Rojo, his compatriots from Argentina. Aguero said he could not make it because he needed to pick up family members from the airport - even though his agent pencilled in the event several weeks ago. But Rojo, the Manchester United hard-man who will be marking Aguero at the Etihad, had another theory. ‘I thought he was going to be here, just like you did. Maybe he’s scared!’ Manchester City striker Sergio Aguero takes part in training on Saturday . Rojo was not being entirely serious. But the pair do have history and Aguero’s decision to swerve the Premier League Kicks community event does heighten anticipation for their duel on Sunday — the ultimate grudge match in a derby full of blood and thunder. The pair were Argentina team-mates at the World Cup and it was well-known they exchanged angry words after Rojo invited his best friend, pop star El Polaco, into the dressing-room after a game. El Polaco happens to be the former boyfriend of Aguero’s partner Karina ‘La Princesita’ Tejeda, who is also a singer, and Aguero was furious by what he regarded as his team-mate’s treachery. Even putting aside their personal relationship, Rojo promises no quarter will be given professionally. Angel di Maria, Marcos Rojo and Pablo Zabaleta take part in a charity event on Friday . Aguero scored four goals in City’s last Premier League home game against Tottenham and he has taken over the mantle from Luis Suarez as the hottest striker in England. If Rojo stops Aguero, United will believe they can win. ‘He’s one of the top strikers in the world and you have to stick close to him, that’s for sure. Be very attentive and get into him with a degree of firmness,’ asserts 24-year-old Rojo. ‘It will be a hard game and you have to play in a hard way. I don’t mean go crunching in, but to go in tough, the way he does. You have to play with close marking and strong tackles. ‘Certainly in the penalty area he is a very quick mover and gets into position very quickly. He can be controlled but it is up to us to keep an eye on where he is at all times. ‘I’ve never played against him before. We might exchange the odd word during the game but generally with opponents you tend to forget [who they are]. He’s City. We’re United. And that’s it. You put all that behind you, you go out there for the team and winning is everything.’ James Milner may be given a central role in the Manchester derby after David Silva was ruled out . Rojo played as a left-back during the World Cup when Argentina reached the final. The fact he has been centre-back for United so far this season sums up the chronic injury crisis that has beset United boss Louis van Gaal. He cannot call on centre-halves Phil Jones, Jonny Evans and Paddy McNair as well as striker Falcao. Michael Carrick is just coming back from long-term injury and would be a risk to start. On the plus side, skipper Wayne Rooney is back from suspension and he will be looking to add to his record tally of 11 goals in the Manchester derby. Rojo, whose £16 million summer move from Sporting Lisbon was initially delayed because of work permits caused by an ongoing dispute in Argentina involving his family and neighbours, is happy to take on the responsibility in the middle. ‘The coach knows I’m very happy to play left or central,’ he stresses. Unusually, United and City go into the derby having failed to win their last couple of games. Angel di Maria shows off his skills during a joint Premier League Kicks charity event on Friday . As champions, expectations are particularly high at City, who will be without playmaker David Silva who was injured in the disappointing midweek Capital One Cup defeat by Newcastle. This will also be City’s fourth game in 13 days whereas United have played only once in the corresponding period. It is a situation City manager Manuel Pellegrini accepts is not ideal, particularly with morale low after a midweek Capital One Cup exit, but he does not want his players to use it as an excuse. ‘Of course when you have the whole week to work for a game, maybe you can do it better,’ he accepts. ‘When you play every three days, you are just trying to recover as you can. ‘But last year we played a lot more games than Liverpool and we had an obligation to win. This year might be the same. We must play the amount of games we have to play and win the games. I never use excuses.’ Manchester City midfielder Yaya Toure wears a snood to keep warm during training . City have been the dominant side in derbies for the past few seasons, their most notable victory being a 6-1 romp at Old Trafford in 2011. But their most recent successes were also 3-0 and 4-1. ‘I don’t think those scorelines are normal. Even half-nil would do this time,’ smiled the Chilean. Perhaps the outcome will depend on the private battle between Aguero and Rojo. They both grew up more than seven thousand miles away in Argentina, but on Sunday it is all about the pride of Manchester. First-team players from both Manchester clubs were on hand to take part in a Premier League Kicks session between City in the Community and the Manchester United Foundation.","Man United defender Marcos Rojo will be marking Sergio Aguero in derby .

"Eleven straight wins for Real Madrid and 17 league goals for Cristiano Ronaldo – the numbers are frightening and even more so when put alongside those of Liverpool who have only scored 13 league goals as a team so far this season. Real Madrid ran out 4-0 winners over Granada and even by recent standards this was spectacular stuff with Ronaldo scoring the first goal after just 99 seconds. The goal owed much to the tenacity of full-back Dani Carvajal and the precision of the pass from Karim Benzema, but also to Ronaldo’s own ruthless efficiency. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Carlo Ancelotti: Every game different, Liverpool will be tough .

James Rodriguez doubled Real's advantage in the first half firing home on after 30 minutes . The Colombian playmaker (left) is congratulated by his team-mates after scoring Real's second against Granada . After Carvajal had dispossessed Jeison Murillo close to the byline and fed Benzema the Frenchman played in Ronaldo and, while lesser mortals might have struggled for accuracy so early in the match, the Portuguese thundered the ball first time past Roberto. The shot was practically Ronaldo’s first touch. Roberto’s first touch was to pick the ball out of his own net. Ronaldo almost paid Carvajal back for his part in the goal with a back-heeled assist from the same byline from where the defender had played his part in the opening goal but Carvajal’s shot went high over Roberto’s bar. Madrid were again playing with their midfield quartet of pass-masters Toni Kroos, Luka Modric, James Rodriguez and Isco and again they had rivals Granada dizzy as they dominated possession. It is little wonder that some Real Madrid fans are wondering just who drops out when Gareth Bale returns. The Welshman was left out of the squad but could be fit for Tuesday as Liverpool bring their dismal recent record to the Santiago Bernabeu. One player who is unlikely to be left out is  Rodriguez who scored the second goal on the half hour with a wonder volley from just inside the area. Carvajal took a throw-in that Benzema flicked up to the 23-year-old. The French striker expected the Colombian midfielder to play the ball back to him but instead Madrid’s £60 million  summer signing just lashed it first time into Roberto’s top corner. It summed up Real’s current sky-high confidence and the whole Madrid bench were on their feet to applaud the flash of brilliance. Ronaldo (centre) was a constant menace to the Granada defence as his sensational season continues . Alvaro Arbeloa (left) came on before half-time due to an injury to first-choice right back Dani Carvajal . Karim Benzema (right) made it 3-0 to Real shortly after half-time with a neatly-taken finish . Benzema (centre) is congratulated by Alvaro Arbeloa (left) and Isco as they cruise to an easy victory . The only threat to Real was coming from themselves with Sergio Ramos and Pepe flying studs-first into each other as they tried to block a rare Granada attack. Carvajal then pulled up with an ankle problem and had to be replaced by Alvaro Arbeloa before the break. The change did little to affect the game but will be one fewer problem for Liverpool if he is out on Tuesday. Arbeloa does not carry quite the same threat going forward. Madrid made it three on 54 minutes and there was more Ronaldo brilliance although for once in the assist and not the finish – his back-heeled pass into space played Benzema through perfectly and he dispatched with ease past Roberto. Granada came into the game more in the second half and Ramos had to block a Ruben Rochina shot. The ball came out to the same player but he fired over. Iker Casillas was busier too and got down well to block a shot from Javi Marquez as Granada looked for a consolation goal. Rodriguez (front) made it 4-0 late on, tapping home from close range as Real celebrated an 11th straight win . The 23-year-old (left) is all smiles with Sergio Ramos as the Bernabeu outfit move top of La Liga . Ronaldo (centre) was hugged by a young fan as he left the pitch at full-time following Real's emphatic triumph . But there were also chances at the other end with Marcelo hitting the bar and Benzema missing from close range and when the next goal did come it was Madrid’s. Benzema played Arbeloa down the right and his cross was turned goalwards by Ronaldo. The ball may have trickled in anyway but Rodriguez made sure sliding it over the line for his second goal of the game. Granada coach Joaquin Caparros had been furious before the game because he felt he had been misquoted saying ‘all I ask is that they don’t walk all over us’. He tore the offending Marca front page up in his pre-match press conference. If it had been designed to inspire his players it failed. Madrid had walked all over Granada and torn them to pieces. Liverpool face a team in terrifying form.

Just when it seemed West Ham’s bubble was about to burst and Mark Hughes would be handed three points on his birthday, Stewart Downing delivered two moments of quality to rescue a draw at Stoke. Hughes saw his team produce their best football this season and take a deserved two-goal lead. Victor Moses opened his account for Stoke in a fine display and Diouf score his fourth goal of the season. But they failed to hold on as Sam Allardyce made the changes that extend his side’s unbeaten run to four. While Stoke’s finishing ultimately cost them victory, their manager was furious at the decision by referee Chris Foy not to send off Alex Song as Enner Valencia scored to put West Ham back in the game.

Song dived in two-footed on Mame Biram Diouf and could have been dismissed but Downing broke with purpose and crossed brilliantly for the Ecuadorian to head home 22 seconds later. Hughes said: ‘I’m really disappointed with their first goal. Song dived in two-footed. Thankfully Mame Biram jumped out of the way but the referee should have stopped the game. It was a dangerous challenge. ‘It was potentially a red card because Song was out of control. He (Foy) is one of our senior referees so he’s got to be better than that.’ Asked whether the decision might have been different were the offending player from Stoke, Hughes replied: ‘I can’t say that. I can think it, maybe.’ Downing scored the equaliser himself 17 minutes from time with a driven right-foot shot to prove it is now more than simply a leg to stand on. Allardyce knew his side were fortunate to escape from the Britannia Stadium with a point. ‘I was glad it was only 1-0 at half-time,’ said Allardyce, whose team improved when Downing moved to the centre of midfield and Carlton Cole arrived from the bench to support Valencia up front. ‘That extra quality we’ve got this year paid dividends when it looked like we might not get a point. It was not necessarily well-deserved but shows the character of our team.’ West Ham slipped to fifth but maintain pace with the Champions League hunters in their best start since the 1999-2000 campaign. They were shorn of their most potent weapon in Diafra Sakho, who scored in each of his last seven games but failed to recover from a shoulder injury. Allardyce brought in Cheikhou Kouyate and left Valencia as his lone forward in a departure from the team that beat Manchester City last weekend. More cautious, it should have meant added stability in midfield but Stoke never allowed the visitors to settle. Early in the game, Bojan whipped a low centre from the right that Diouf, two yards out, would have scored from had he made the merest touch and in the 33rd minute Stoke went ahead.

Geoff Cameron was granted too much time and his cross was cleared only as far as Diouf, who laid it to Bojan in the box. James Collins failed to fully block his shot, allowing Moses to dive ahead of Carl Jenkinson and scramble the ball over the line. To add to West Ham’s woes, Winston Reid was forced off with a thigh injury. Stoke could have been two-up in injury time. Cameron flicked a cross that Diouf judged better than Collins, turning to bear down on West Ham keeper Adrian, who reacted brilliantly to divert the finish behind. Stoke did extend their lead 11 minutes after half time. Aaron Cresswell allowed Jon Walters to reach Marc Wilson’s cross-field ball, and was then beaten again by the Stoke winger as he delivered a perfect cross to Diouf, who applied the finishing header. Stoke were rampant but the match turned shortly afterwards. Song went unpunished for his lunge and Downing beat Eric Pieters to race down the right. His deep cross was superb and Valencia headed in. As the home crowd bristled, the match swung one way then another, before West Ham mounted the attack which brought them a point. Valencia picked up the ball on the left and delivered a low cross that travelled all the way to Downing, who struck a solid shot to beat Asmir Begovic. Stoke could have restored their lead when Cameron stretched to reach Walters’ cross but Adrian stuck out a palm to save. Foy failed to award a corner. Not the only thing he missed, Hughes would argue, frustrated his 51st birthday failed to end with a bang. ‘I’m getting old and we didn’t win so it’s not a good combination.’ ‘That’s one of our most creative and dynamic performances this season. I’m delighted but we need to convert more of our chances.’ Downing (No 11) took the ball from his own half before setting up Valencia (No 31) for West Ham's first goal .

Hughes was incensed when Song went unpunished for a reckless lunge on Diouf that eventually allowed Downing to beat Eric Pieters and race down the right. His deep cross was superb, bypassing Stoke’s centre-backs, to provide Valencia with a straight-forward header back across and beyond the dive of Begovic. As Hughes told the assistant referee nearby of his grievances, West Ham celebrated. The Stoke manager had a point, Song was lucky to stay on the pitch. As the home crowd bristled the match swung one way then another, before West Ham mounted the attack which brought them a point. Valencia picked up the ball on the left and managed to deliver a low cross that travelled all the way to Downing, who struck a solid shot that Begovic failed to keep out. Stoke could have restored their lead in the closing stages when Cameron stretched to reach Walters’s cross but as the ball trickled goalwards Adrian stuck out a palm to save.

"HANDS OFF IN THE BOX is our new campaign to rid football of the dark arts of the penalty box. Whether it is wrestling, grappling, shirt pulling - or the outrageous headlocks witnessed in the Manchester United vs Chelsea match - the area has become a free-for-all for cheating. And that means fewer goals in the Barclays Premier League. For too long, referees have failed to punish players for blatantly stopping opponents from scoring. It's time to end that. So join us in our campaign to say Hands Off In The Box to players and referees. We’ll be naming and shaming the cheats and the officials who let them get away with it. Sportsmail has launched a campaign to stop exponents of the penalty box dark arts getting away with blatant cheating. Hands Off In The Box aims to put an end to the increasing amount of wrestling, grappling and shirt pulling that goes on  throughout the Premier League. Those who commit these offences are quite simply denying the football-watching public more goals. And although this has been going on for years in the Premier League, the sight of Manchester United's Chris Smalling and Marcos Rojo manhandling Chelsea's John Terry and Branislav Ivanovic on Sunday was a new low. It was more reminiscent of a wrestling match than a top-flight football game as the Chelsea duo were grappled to the ground with a combination of headlocks and pull downs. More astonishing was the fact that referee Phil Dowd did nothing to stop them, waving away claims to what seemed to everyone else to be an obvious penalty. Now, the key point here is that Manchester United are no worse than any other team for committing these offences, it's just that Sunday's grappling was so high profile. Sportsmail has decided that enough is enough. You can back our campaign by printing out our downloadable Hands Off In The Box logo  and proudly displaying it at matches.

So whatever they decide is grappling, or holding, it’s in their hands really. Did I do it as player? No, I was a winger and didn’t have to mark anyone.’ ian wright Ex-Arsenal striker . ‘There should be an official specifically looking for holding in the box from set-pieces. It was like UFC in the United area.’ Graham Poll, Former top referee . ‘Hold or grapple and you can expect to be cautioned. Once fans, managers and — crucially — players accept it as normal, this campaign will have achieved its aims.’ Martin Keown, Ex-Arsenal defender . ‘Defenders are checking, blocking, holding, grappling, using force to foul opponents — and too often referees are allowing it to take place.’ Micky Mellon, Shrewsbury Town manager . ‘In a congested area how can you judge if someone’s been blocked? It’s part of the game and some people are good at it. It’s football. A local Football League referee came in and he was asking me about it. “Can you show me some blocking techniques?” That was great, he was trying to find ways of detecting it. The confusing thing for managers is that fouls outside the area are given as free-kicks, but the same won’t be given as penalties. There has to be consistency.’ And the readers of MailOnline... ‘It’s more infuriating because we never hear from the refs themselves. It’s about time the refs were made to answer the media just like players.’ Willdajack, Neath . ‘To those saying if there was a clampdown every game would be littered with penalties, that would be true for a couple of weeks then it would stop.

"Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers has held up Cristiano Ronaldo as a role model for Raheem Sterling and other young English players striving to reach the top. Rodgers has the unenviable task of formulating a plan to stop Ronaldo when Liverpool play Real Madrid in the Bernabeu on Tuesday night, having been beaten 3-0 by the Champions League holders at Anfield. He was full of admiration for the way 29-year-old Ronaldo handled the difficult weather conditions on Merseyside and his overall ‘persistence’ in winning back the World Player of the Year crown from Lionel Messi, having spent a long time in the Argentine’s shadow. VIDEOS Scroll down to watch . Cristiano Ronaldo (centre) was hugged by a young fan as he left the pitch after Real's 4-0 win in Granada . Raheem Sterling is challenge by Hull City's Alex Bruce during Liverpool's 0-0 draw at Anfield . Ronaldo (centre) was a constant menace to the Granada defence as his sensational season continues . Rodgers believes it is a lesson players like his own emerging teenage star Sterling can learn from if they want longevity in their careers. ‘I do hold up Ronaldo as an example,’ he said. ‘I saw pictures of him training at Anfield the night before our first game with Real Madrid; it was hammering it down and freezing cold. And he was smiling, he was happy. ‘Before the start of the game, he was stood there, just taking all of it in, drinking his water and probably loving being back in England again. 'And when he was ready to go to work, he threw the bottle away and he went to work. This is an incredible player and a great, great professional. As a manager, it’s great to see people like that.’ Sterling is one of five English players nominated for the 2014 European Golden Boy award . Sterling has been at the centre of some unwanted headlines this season. His form has, at times, been extremely good but there was also a link with Real, denied by their coach Carlo Ancelotti, which was regarded in some quarters as a ploy by his agent to help contract talks with Liverpool. Even more damagingly was ‘Tiredgate’, which was caused by some remarks by England manager Roy Hodgson, who left him out of the starting line-up for a Euro 2016 qualifier against Estonia. Rodgers says his young player must keep going — just as Ronaldo has done. ‘You could argue that, at 19, Raheem has had a similar impact as Ronaldo had when he came to the country; that game (Manchester United v Bolton in August 2003) when he first came on as sub and made an impact. Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers issues instructions to Sterling on the Anfield touchline . CRISTIANO RONALDO . Age 29 . Club Career 538 games, 366 goals . International Career 116 caps, 51 goals (Portugal) Honours Two Champions Leagues, Premier League and La Liga titlesm twice world player of the year . RAHEEM STERLING . Age 19 . Club Career 90 games, 15 goals . International Career 11 caps, 0 goals (England) Honours Liverpool young player of the year . ‘Certainly in these past couple of years, Raheem has made a similar impact at the beginning of his career. It’s now about going to those next levels with the second part of his curve. ‘The first part is coming in and establishing yourself as a young player — it’s not easy earning that respect. Now, hopefully, he’ll move on. He won’t have a better role model than Ronaldo. 'He’s super-efficient. What I’ve loved about Ronaldo is that you talk about persistence and professionalism in life — this is a guy who turned up for the Ballon D’or four years on the trot, probably thinking on a couple of occasions that he’s going to be close to winning it. ‘The little guy (Messi) is a genius and I’m a massive admirer of his talent, but Ronaldo kept going, kept fighting and then deservedly won it last year. And if you’re talking about the last year, you have to say Ronaldo has been the best player in terms of club and, arguably, international football.’ At 19, Sterling is becoming a superstar... while  Ronaldo was starring for Portugal at the same age . This week’s return clash against Real Madrid is also a big test for Rodgers, who was disappointed again on Saturday as his team lost 1-0 at a revitalised Newcastle United. They were comprehensively beaten at home by Real, with Ronaldo among the scorers. West Ham manager Sam Allardyce recently gave an interview in which he grouped Rodgers with Arsene Wenger and Manuel Pellegrini as managers who ‘won’t adjust’ to the opposition. The implication was that the Liverpool manager was naïve — a charge that Rodgers refutes strongly. ‘I think it’s totally wrong,’ he said. ‘Throughout my time here, I’ve tweaked elements of our game. I like the team to dominate with the ball and control the ball. But there were games last year where we dominated on the counter-attack. Ronaldo celebrates after scoring in the 2004 FA Cup final against Millwall in Cardiff . Sterling has 11 caps for England and 90 appearances for Liverpool, but still has a lot to learn as a teenager . ‘When you say ‘‘not change’’, I’m not sure there’s a coach that has played more systems than I have played in the last couple of years. The principles stay the same, but the systems change. We played a different system the other night (in the Capital One Cup against Swansea) and it brought us a win. ‘People will look at me and think I have an identity. I’m happy with that. But as a coach you have to be able to adapt and change. I’m not dogmatic, I’m pragmatic.’ Rodgers is trying to steady the ship after the sale of Luis Suarez to Barcelona, and an influx of summer signings. Ronaldo was the ultimate professional when he returned to England with Real Madrid in the Champions League . Suarez was conspicuous by his absence among the nominees for this year’s World Player of the Year crown, with Ronaldo odds-on to win it again. The Uruguayan had an outstanding first half of the year until his infamous World Cup bite on Italy’s Giorgio Chiellini led to a ban. Rodgers felt Suarez should have been included on football criteria. ‘I couldn’t think of a reason why he wouldn’t be in it football-wise,’ he said. ‘I don’t believe it is fair. It’s the Golden Ball, not the Golden Ball and Mouth. If anyone in the world names the five best players at the moment they would probably say Ronaldo, Messi, Neymar, Suarez and Bale. How can four be in it and one who is not? Well it’s not football then.’","Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers believes Cristiano Ronaldo is the perfect role model for Raheem Sterling .

"Steven Fletcher says he is all too accustomed to life in the Premier League relegation zone – but Sunderland boss Gus Poyet wants his players to snap from that mindset.

We know we have got the ability to stay in this league, the players we have got, you see it in training every day, some of the performances from the lads. ‘But we just need to do it as a team and do it on a Saturday, or on a Monday.

Poyet, though, fears there is a lingering mentality of acceptance at the club. ‘It is a problem that we have been there for four years, fighting for that,’ he said. ‘It is my challenge to change that - to not have the feeling at this football club or the city that we are going to be always fighting down there.’ Fletcher, meanwhile, started the season out of the side but won over his manager to emerge as first-choice striker. And the 27-year-old insists he never lost faith in his own ability. ‘I wasn't really missing loads of chances – if I was starting to miss chances, then I would start questioning myself, but I wasn't,’ he said. ‘Maybe I wasn't getting into the positions that I was before, I don't know, but I wasn't missing chances, so that didn't affect me. ‘But I feel back to the way I did when I signed for Sunderland. I feel sharp again and able to move again, because there were points last season where I just felt I couldn't even get into second gear, so it was hard. But I feel good now.’ Fletcher and Poyet would feel a whole lot better were a win at Selhurst Park to lift them from the bottom three.","Steven Fletcher has been relegated with both  Burnley and Wolves .

The defender, who was previously banned for 45 matches for assaulting opposition players and abusing officials, did not expect to escape punishment following the incident but was shocked at the length of the ban. 'I had expected one or two years maximum. But 50 years? Football’s my life.' Ferreira said. The ban served is officially life-long but the governing body's computer required an end-date, which was set 50 years later.

"Swansea defender Neil Taylor is not getting carried away with top six thoughts despite another well-earned point for the impressive Welsh side. The Swans survived the second-half dismissal of Jonjo Shelvey to hang on for a goalless draw at Everton and further underline their presence at the top end of the Barclays Premier League. Overall, Garry Monk's side lacked their usual fluency in a drab affair at Goodison Park but they moderated their ambition after Shelvey's red card 18 minutes from time to ensure they avoided defeat. Swansea had to play with ten men after Jonjo Shelvey was shown a red card but held on to get a point . It said much for their defensive discipline under former centre-back Monk, who has attempted to add resilience to the free-flowing style that has become well established at the Liberty Stadium. But any idea that the Swans can maintain the momentum and push for a place in Europe is something left-back Taylor is not ready to consider. The Wales international said: 'We are not thinking about anything like that. It's week by week. 'We have got a couple of massive games now against Arsenal and Manchester City and they are games where if we can get clean sheets it would be brilliant. 'But we are not getting ahead of ourselves. There are games this season we should have gone on to win and games like Saturday where we have nicked points away from home at good places. Neil Taylor says Swansea are not thinking about European football, despite their place in the top six . Wilfried Bony fires wide as Swansea pushed for a win, but in the end they had to hold out for a draw . 'It is a crazy league and you have to take it week by week. I think teams are going to jump up a few places or drop down a few places every week. Top six? I don't know, but we will keep striving to do well.' There were few chances at Goodison but Swansea had reason to feel aggrieved when Everton defender Antolin Alcaraz - who later went off with a serious shoulder injury - appeared to stretch out a hand to stop a Shelvey shot in the first half. Shelvey protested but referee Kevin Friend gave nothing and the former Liverpool midfielder's frustration might have contributed to his needless first booking soon after. Shelvey kicked the ball away after conceding a foul and that was something that he would later regret when he was sent off after 72 minutes for impeding James McCarthy. Garry Monk's side have become defensively more resilient this season, while continuing their good football . Taylor, 25, said: 'First half we were under the cosh and had to defend really well. Second half we came out and for the first 20 minutes we were perhaps the better team. We could have got a goal in that spell and were starting to think we could maybe win the game, but then the sending-off changed the game and you look then to get the point. 'We did that and we have got to be happy with a point. They are a really offensive team and they commit men forward with a lot of attacking talent. If you keep a clean sheet at Goodison you have got to be happy.' The Toffees did apply late pressure but were unable to make it count. They might have snatched victory with what would have been the final touch of the game as Samuel Eto'o delivered a dangerous ball but Romelu Lukaku could not make contact in front of goal. Antolin Alcaraz, who suffered a serious injury, was lucky not to concede a penalty at Goodison Park . The main positive for Roberto Martinez's men was that the result at least extended their unbeaten Premier League run to four games. Goalkeeper Tim Howard said: 'I think we're all frustrated. It was a nothing game. There weren't many chances at either end. 'It was disappointing for us because we like to score lots of goals but we kept a clean sheet, which is a positive and a draw at home keeps us going. Tim Howard shows frustration as Everton failed to score against ten men, in what he called a 'nothing game' 'We are playing well. We are in the middle of a pretty good run. Of course we would have liked to have won but we have got two other big games this week and this keeps us ticking over, and keeps us unbeaten in a few games.'

"Saracens kicked off their LV=Cup campaign with a 25-20 win over London rivals Harlequins in an entertaining game at Allianz Park. The home side led 15-3 at the interval and appeared to be in complete control only for Quins to improve greatly in the second half and run them close. Quins were totally out of sorts in the first half as elementary errors presented their opponents with two tries and Saracens should have had the game firmly in the bag at the interval. Saracens kicked off their LV=Cup campaign with a 25-20 win over London rivals Harlequins . Duncan Taylor, Mike Ellery and Jack Wilson scored Saracens' tries with Ben Spencer kicking two penalties and two conversions. Louis Grimoldby kicked a first-half penalty for Quins and the second half saw their resurgence rewarded with tries from Mark Lambert and Charlie Walker, with replacement Tim Swiel converting both and kicking a penalty. Both sides selected strong line-ups. Saracens included Jim Hamilton and Mouritz Botha at lock with Jacques Burger and Ernst Joubert in the back row. Argentine international, Juan Figallo, signed from Montpellier made his debut at prop. Quins had George Lowe and Jordan Turner-Hall as a formidable centre partnership with Luke Wallace and Will Collier both starting in the pack. Ben Ransom of Saracens hands-off Olly Lindsay during their LV=Cup clash on Sunday . Spencer gave Saracens an early lead by kicking a third minute penalty and it was the home side who dominated the opening period. They looked to have scored the first try when following a line-out, Rhys Gill and Maro Itoje appeared to have driven over the Quins' line but the television match official ruled no try. Saracens continued to be the better side but failed to increase their advantage and it was Quins who came closest to scoring when Nils Mordt took too long with his clearance kick. Ollie Lindsay-Hague successfully charged it down, but Sarries managed to scramble clear the danger. However, it was another charge down which provided Saracens with their first try. Grimoldby's kick failed to clear Taylor, who collected the loose ball to score with Spencer converting. Charlie Walker scores a second-half try for the visitors but it isn't enough to save them from defeat . Minutes later, Saracens were over again capitalising on more errors from the visitors. Ross Chisholm missed a tackle on Ben Ransom to allow the fullback to feed Ellery before the wing brushed aside a poor attempt from Lowe to race over in the corner. A Grimoldby penalty put Quins on the scoreboard but Saracens nearly had their third try when Nick Tompkins was forced into touch, just short of the try-line. Trailing 15-3 at the interval, Quins had their best period of the match, immediately after the restart.

A minute later the lead was extended further as Williams broke through after a great offload from outside centre Ryan Crotty. It was a straight sprint to the line for the former rugby league star as the United States defence was too slow to react.

"Understudy goalkeeper Lee Robinson admits he would love to finally make his Old Firm debut - 11 years after first joining Rangers. The 28-year-old spent five years at Ibrox as a youngster but tasted just 15 minutes of first-team action. He was brought back to the club in the summer to provide back up to Cammy Bell and Steven Simonsen and was at last given his first start for the Light Blues in Saturday's 1-0 win against Dumbarton as Rangers booked a place in the William Hill Scottish Cup fourth round. Lee Robinson (above) wants to earn a starting spot for Rangers ahead of the cup semi-final against Celtic . Robinson deputised in place of the injured Steven Simonson and Cammy Bell in the 1-0 win over Dumbarton . But news of that victory was immediately overshadowed as Gers were paired with bitter Old Firm rivals Celtic in an explosive League Cup semi-final. Robinson may not even make the bench for that game - due to be played on either January 31 or February 1 next year - with Simonsen now recovered from the head knock which kept him out against the Sons and Bell due to be back in action early in the new year after shoulder surgery. But the Englishman insists he will be ready to face Ronny Deila's Hoops if called upon. Robinson said: ""I'm sure this is a draw that will excite the boys - I'm probably the wrong person to ask because I've only been here a few months. ""I was only on the bench for one Old Firm game during my first stint here. That was back in 2006 or something and we lost 2-0. ""But I would love to be part of something like that."" Simonson (above) has been unavailable after needing hospital treatment when he collided with the post . Cammy Bell (above) should return from shoulder surgery to be available for when Rangers face Celtic . Rangers saw off the Sons for the second time in a week thanks to Kris Boyd's third goal in five games. The former Scotland striker clipped the ball in off the post a minute before half-time after a great spot by Lewis Macleod set him up - leaving the goalscorer to praise the 20-year-old for another moment of brilliance. Boyd - who watched Macleod head home the winner against St Johnstone on Tuesday night to set up the Old Firm semi - said: ""We've seen the performances Lewis has put in in the past couple of months. Kris Boyd (left) and Kenny Miller (right) celebrate Boyd's goal as Rangers won 1-0 against Dumbarton . ""He's a fantastic talent and as long as he keeps working hard at his game and learning, developing and listening he can go far. ""He's a fantastic young kid with a bright future but the most important thing for him is to keep doing the right things. ""But when you see him on a field he's a joy to watch and you feel that every time he picks up the ball something is going to happen.""","Goalkeeper Lee Robinson started in Rangers' 1-0 win against Dumbarton .

"Kyle Eastmond and Brad Barritt are expected to be named as England’s centre pairing to face the All Blacks on Saturday as Stuart Lancaster tries yet another midfield combination. Without Manu Tuilagi (groin) and Luther Burrell (hand), Lancaster is understood to favour Bath rugby league convert Eastmond and Saracens stalwart Barritt in a bid to repeat the shock victory his side pulled off over the world champions two years ago. Eastmond, 25, has been the form No 12 in the Aviva Premiership this season while the trusted Barritt has impressed since returning from injury three weeks ago and is set to be named in the outside centre position. Brad Barritt passes the ball during the England training session held at Pennyhill Park . Kyle Eastmond of Engladn moves away from Aaron Smith during the International Test Match between the All Blacks and England at Eden Park on June 7, 2014 in Auckland . ‘Brad brings a huge amount defensively and physically and he is a very good reader of the defence and sets the defensive tone,’ said Lancaster this week. ‘He has improved his decision-making and his ability to get over the gain line. His performance against the Crusaders [on tour last summer] was his best in an England shirt for a while. He is a strong leader within the team. He wants to improve, he has great humility and he is definitely improving in all areas.’ Eastmond — who weighs just 80kg — was outstanding alongside Tuilagi in the first Test in the summer before being harshly dropped for the second and then struggling when recalled for the third. But his form has been so good for Bath at the start of this season it looks certain he will be picked ahead of Billy Twelvetrees and Jonathan Joseph — assuming he has recovered from the rib injury picked up on club duty a fortnight ago.

"Steven Gerrard says it is ‘nonsense’ that his old Liverpool team-mate Luis Suarez is not on the short list for world footballer of the year. Oh well, only one of the three occasions on which the Vampire In The Box has bitten an opponent actually took place during the World Cup finals, which are the ultimate showpiece of the global game. So what’s all the fuss about? Steven Gerrard 'can't believe' that former Liverpool striker Luis Suarez isn't on the Ballon d'Or shortlist . Suarez was on fire for Liverpool last term, but hit controversy again in the summer . Suarez's year took a significant turn for the worse when he opted to bite Giorgio Chiellini in July . Rio Ferdinand is bewildered at being banned and fined for tweeting the word ‘sket’ to imply that the mother of one of his critics on social media is a ‘promiscuous woman,’ by dictionary definition. Oh come on, he only told someone who questioned his abilities as a centre half to ‘get ya mum in, plays the field well.’ So since his QPR manager Harry Redknapp is at pains to assure us he’s ‘a top-class person,’ who’s to take offence? Queens Park Rangers defender Rio Ferdinand has been given a three-game suspension by the FA . Ferdinand has been charged for this tweet, made on September 1, for using the slang term 'sket' And to think I’ve always argued that the football authorities would be better advised electing their presidents, chairmen, chief executives and board members from among our leading players. Time for a rethink. Both these men have captained England. Both are being canvassed for high office when they come to the end of their playing careers, which is fairly imminent. Ferdinand is actually campaigning to become Britain’s representative at FIFA and is already a member of FA chairman Greg Dyke’s eccentric commission which is supposed to be researching ways of improving our national game. Heaven help us. Harry Redknapp criticised Ferdinand's ban and believes footballers would be better off without Twitter . Gerrard and Ferdinand have been outstanding players, for Liverpool and Manchester United respectively. Each has given sterling service to England. But one can’t see the obvious, that Suarez has forfeited his place on the Ballon d’Or list alongside the likes of Cristiano Ronaldo, Lionel Messi, Neymar, Gareth Bale and Javier Mascherano. The other doesn’t grasp that smearing the morals of a mother he has never met is as obscene as the racist slurs to which he himself has been so vilely subjected. Ferdinand comes across as a natural successor to UEFA president Michel Platini . So we are left with little or no option but to conclude that most of their brains are in their boots. Stevie G is said to be still considering his future. Judging by his latest interview… careful. Rio might switch his ambitions to UEFA. During his deconstructed ramblings on Jonathan Ross this week he came across as the natural successor to Michel Platini, who is forever busy proving that even all-time world class footballers do not make presidents. Seems there really is only one Franz Beckenbauer. Gerrard should know that Suarez forfeited his place in the Ballon d'Or shortlist because of the bite .","Steven Gerrard thinks it's nonsense Luis Suarez isn't up for the Ballon d'Or .

"Calm, relaxed and assured, it is hard to believe that less than three years ago Danny Care was in danger of squandering his career. A string of alcohol-related offences culminated in the gifted young Harlequin being banished from England’s squad by Stuart Lancaster, fined £10,000 by his club and banned from driving for 16 months. It was a grim time as English rugby’s World Cup hangover showed no sign of clearing. In many ways, Care’s actions made the situation worse and Lancaster’s no-nonsense decision to remove his former charge from the squad proved the first decisive step in instilling discipline and core values in a team who had lost their way. Danny Care runs with the ball during England training at Pennyhill Park this week . Just three years ago, Care's England future was in doubt, but now he is a pivotal part of the team . Reminiscing on a controversial past, Care reveals he wouldn't swap it as it's made him a better person now . This week, Care could barely contain his joy as he spoke about his son, Blake, at England’s Pennyhill Park base. Reintegrated, refreshed and bursting with paternal pride, Care epitomises the journey that has seen the England squad reinvent themselves under Lancaster. Next Saturday the 27-year-old will take on the world champion All Blacks at Twickenham — almost certainly as England’s starting No 9 — knowing just how close he came to blowing it. ‘Everyone’s got their own story and everyone goes through good and bad times,’ he said. ‘It’s part of life. It’s part of growing up. I wouldn’t change what happened to me now. I think it made me the player and person I am today. I’ve learnt from those experiences. I went back and worked on my game and took it a lot more seriously. Care on club duty for Harlequins last week, as they played Wasps in the European Champions Cup . Care was frustrated when he was dropped from the England squad - he clearly loves being a part of the team . ‘Any player who doesn’t get picked for a squad, through his own wrong-doing or others playing well, you always question “how am I going to get back in?” But the coaches, especially Stuart, made it very clear that if I got my rugby talking again and did my stuff on the pitch then the door wasn’t shut at all. ‘He just got frustrated saying “I know your potential and you’re not fulfilling it at the moment”. It was a bit of an eye-opener not getting picked. To not be picked for your country for your own wrong-doing is a horrible feeling. I’ll never let it happen again.’ Everything about his response to being dropped indicated the Leeds Academy graduate was ready to get serious. Lancaster’s decision to discipline Care, who he had coached since he was a schoolboy while becoming friends with his parents, sent a long overdue shot across the player’s bows. It marked the start of the rebuilding process. Slowly, England started to re-engage with a public who had utterly lost trust following the dwarf-tossing hedonism of New Zealand 2011. ‘I’ve known Stuart since I was 14 or 15 and I’m still as scared of him now as I was back then,’ Care said. ‘He still gives you that look when he’s not happy. He’s a coach who you want to play for. I learnt pretty quickly what was unacceptable and what was not. Care tackles Jonathan Davies of Wales during a match at Twickenham on March 9, 2014 . Care has impressed for Harlequins, and is almost certain to start as number nine for England next weekend . ‘Stuart believes in all these values, about what being an England rugby player means, the number of people we’re representing — people who have worn the shirt before, the people who will wear it in the future. We owe it to them to do it justice. ‘He strips you right back to the people we’re playing for. He mentioned a 17-year-old lad who came to see us last year and unfortunately lost his life through cancer. He came to train, met all the players, we sent him off a shirt. And apparently to his last couple of days, it was one of the best experiences he’d ever had. ‘If we can try and help people like that and inspire people like that, we’re doing all right. We want to play for the whole country, we want to give them a smile, and give them a team to really follow and feel a part of.’ Next week Care and his team-mates face the ultimate challenge. Beaten three times by Steve Hansen’s men last summer — at the end of another abysmally scheduled season which saw the Aviva Premiership final played three weeks before the first Test in Auckland — Lancaster’s men have much to do to convince the public they are serious World Cup contenders. But convince them they can, and a performance anywhere near the one which saw them dispatch the same opposition 38-21 at Twickenham two years ago will send expectation levels soaring ahead of next year’s tournament. Care (left) celebrates with Jack Nowell after scoring a try against Wales in February . Care has become a pivotal part of Stuart Lancaster's England set-up . ‘When you look at international sport in general, whether it is football, cricket, rugby or whatever, the All Blacks are right up there as one of the best,’ Lancaster said. ‘I was looking at the German football team since the World Cup. What has been most impressive about the All Blacks is that, after winning the World Cup, sometimes you can subconsciously get a little bit, not complacent, but take your eye off the ball — the Germans have lost a couple of games recently — but the All Blacks kept on winning.’ He added: ‘It is a phenomenal record and it is not like the competition they are playing against is all Tier One nations and they win home and away. Having said that, while we respect them, we have to make sure we create our own belief that we can do that and we know we can do it. We have beaten them and pushed them close as well.’ Lancaster will name his team on Tuesday (TBC), with Care expected to partner Owen Farrell at half-back with Brad Barritt and Kyle Eastmond in the midfield. With Mike Brown set to start at full-back and the pack almost picking itself, the wing positions are hardest to call. Care has enjoyed a long career for England, now in his sixth year of international duty . The scrum-half has a one-month old son, and can hardly contain his delight when he speaks about him . Marland Yarde has been in poor form for his new club, Harlequins, in recent weeks, while Jack Nowell is short of match fitness, Jonny May is yet to convince on the highest stage, and Semesa Rokoduguni is uncapped and untested. Selecting Bath’s Fijian-born winger would be the bravest pick of all. But whatever the outcome next week, Care will go home as a happy man to his partner Josie and month-old son. After plumbing the depths of despair when a toe injury kept him out of the 2011 World Cup —which proved a blessing in disguise in retrospect — the reformed lad from Leeds has learned the meaning of perspective. ‘Missing the last World Cup was brutal,’ he said. ‘Picking up an innocuous injury a couple of weeks before was incredibly hard to take. ‘All you dream about as a kid is to represent your country in the World Cup and to miss it that close was hard to swallow, but it made me even more hungry to try to play in a home World Cup. ‘But being a dad puts a lot of things into perspective and makes you suddenly grow up. For the first in my life I’ve properly got responsibility. I’ve got someone else to look after rather than myself. It’s an unbelievable. I’ve learnt not to worry about the little things in life.’","Danny Care was banished from England's squad less than three years ago .

"Trainer Dan Skelton has received a major boost after Value At Risk, one of the most promising horses in Ireland, was transferred to his care from the stable of troubled trainer Philip Fenton. The five-year-old has won two of his five races and was one of three Fenton-trained horses tested and cleared by the BHA to run at the Cheltenham Festival in March as charges of possessing illegal medicines, including Anabolic Steroids, hung over Fenton. Those charges have subsequently led to a guilty verdict on Fenton, who now faces a Irish Turf Club enquiry with his career in tatters. Trainer Dan Skelton needs only one more win to match last term's tally of 27 successes . Fenton has already lost horses owned by the powerful Gigginstown Stud operation. Value At Risk, owned and bred by England-based Marc Huglin, finished 13th to Super Concorde in the Champion Bumper when enduring a nightmare run. Subsequently he was third to Shaneshill in the Grade One Champion Bumper at the Punchestown Festival. Skelton said: 'Value At Risk is very high calibre. We will be going novice hurdling with him and he has come in fit. Philip Fenton leaves Carrick-On-Suir District Court in Ireland after facing charges of possession of steroids . 'We would like to get him out pretty soon so that if we want to go for a good novice hurdle later in the winter we can. 'The guy who owns and bred him is a bit nervous that the quicker spring ground is not really his cup of tea. 'So, although we have big novice hurdle aspirations in the spring, they would not be the be all and end all. We have one eye on chasing the following season.' Skelton, in his second year with a trainer's licence, needs only one more win to match last term's tally of 27 successes after What A Warrior, ridden by brother Harry, landed the United House Gold Cup at Ascot on Saturday. The success came seven days after the Skelton brothers combined to win the Silver Trophy Handicap Hurdle at Chepstow. What A Warrior is now likely to run in the Hennessy Gold Cup at Newbury where he could face Oliver Sherwood's Many Clouds, an taking winner at Carlisle yesterday. Also Hennessy-bound is Rocky Creek, second to Road To Riches in the Champion Chase at Down Royal and trained by Skelton's old boss Paul Nicholls. The champion trainer remains unperturbed by the disappointing fifth place of Silviniaco Conti behind Menorah in the Charlie Hall Chase at Wetherby. Nicholls said: 'He needs a test of stamina nowadays. He needed it a bit and was flat-out all the way.' Silviniaco Conti and Jonjo O'Neill's Holywell, third to Many Clouds, went into the weekend joint favourites for the Cheltenham Gold Cup. They now share that honour on 10-1 with both 2013 winner Bobs Worth and Champagne Fever. Title holder Lord Windermere is 12-1. The prices reflect the open nature of the staying chase landscape. Can Cadeaux go one better? Ed Dunlop’s Red Cadeaux, twice a runner-up in the Melbourne Cup, will make his fourth attempt to win Australia’s greatest race in the early hours of Tuesday morning. Gerald Mosse’s mount is one of 10 Europeans in a line-up which also includes Johnny Murtagh’s Ebor winner Mutual Regard and 2012 Irish Leger winner Royal Diamond.

"One of rugby's greatest larrkins, Nick Cummins, has made headlines again - not just for his football skills but also his entertaining lingo that has gained him an army of adoring fans. Nicknamed Honey Badger, the former Wallabies cult hero, was interviewed after the Barbarians’ 40-36 loss to Australia at Twickenham Oval in London and delivered his well-loved fair dinkum Aussie style. His impressive performance with the Barbarians, that brings together players from all over the world in the annual entertainment match, has put the spotlight on attempting to bring the winger back home from his recent move to the Coca Cola West Red Sparks in Japan's top league. Nick Cummins gives entertaining interview after playing against his old team - the Wallabies - with the Barbarians team - which brings together players from all over the world . The Honey Badger talks through his try as it is replayed on the screen after the match . Cummins' stellar performance has prompted calls for the winger to be coerced back to Australia . The Badger did not disappoint when being interviewed by a British reporter, Fox Rugby reported. 'It was back and forth it was up and down it was bloody everywhere and mate it was just ah bloody enjoyable rugby mate,' he started off saying to describe the match. 'I was on Animal Planet one night and this thing has come up. It's an absolute machine, it has no natural predators and is the size of a house cat. I just thought: ""This is me. I need to be a badger"",' he told News Corp. 'I sat there and looked at him on the TV running around doing his thing, and I just went, ""I want what he has"".' 'One of the stories which inspired me is that it is documented that a honey badger killed a male lion in a one-on-one battle,' he told Fairfax Media. 'What happened was that he clawed the canastas off the big fella, going the old one-two. The big fella walked around the corner and fell over. The honey badger got up, shook himself, and just trotted off. For me, that was outstanding."" The reporter then asked the Badger to talk through his try during the mach while it was replayed on the screen. 'Basically it was Oi!  Look - no give it here!' he said with great enthusiasm. And as he watched himself fly over the line and score the try on the screen- he got even more excited. 'Oh you beauty! She’s opened up and he’s over! Bit of meat under the posts!' The Badger was asked if he was going to join his former Aussie team mates after the match. 'We'll go to some sort of function we’ll have a few schoots and who knows what can happen from there mate' the character quipped causing the reporter to start laughing. It was pointed out that Cummin's father was in the crowd to watch the game. 'Thank god he just got here in time – we went out last night and saw him and he’s over the moon mate,' he said. 'He come down here today and he almost had a little tear in his eye which bloody means a lot to me, so mate tonight I’ll enjoy it with him.' The in-form 26 year old decided to move to Japan in August after his father was diagnosed with prostate cancer -  he is a single dad with has eight children - two of whom suffer from cystic fibrosis . The in-form 26 year old decided to make the big move to Japan in August after his father, Mark Cummins, was diagnosed with prostate cancer, as the Japanese league is known for offering massive cash incentives usually taken up by players nearing the end of their careers. Named The Queensland Father of the Year in 2012, Mark, who became a single dad five years ago, has eight children - two of whom suffer from cystic fibrosis. Cummin's latest stellar performance has prompted Barbarians coach John Kirwan to call on Australia to do everything they can to get the valuable player back  in time for next year’s World Cup, Fox Rugby reported. Kriwan said if he was Michael Cheika (Wallabies caoch) he would be trying to get Cummins 'home as quick as I could' who he described as a 'special athlete'. 'He just knows how to sniff out a try and I thought what he did defensively today was incredible,' Kirwan said. However, Cheika said the decision was up to Cummins, who had signed a two year contract with the West Red Sparks, whether he moved back Down Under in order to be eligible to represent Australia in the World Cup next year.

"Bernie Ecclestone has urged Formula One's teams to start making sacrifices in a bid to save the sport from completely imploding. Ecclestone's words of warning come at the end of a miserable period for F1, notably with Caterham and Marussia entering administration. With costs spiralling out of control, and with the FIA powerless to act, three other cash-strapped teams in Lotus, Force India and Sauber have threatened to boycott the United States Grand Prix as a protest at what they perceive as a lack of action to stop the folly. Formula 1 boss Bernie Ecclestone says he is to blame for problems afflicting some of the smaller teams . Ecclestone, however, has dismissed that prospect out of hand. 'Forget all that c**p,' the F1 chief said. 'I promise they will be racing. 'They will be racing, I give you a guarantee - but I worry if they will be racing next year.' Therein lies Ecclestone's major problem - one which has surprisingly led him to concede that 'I know what's wrong, but don't know how to fix it'. Ecclestone added: 'No-one is prepared to do anything about it because they can't. The regulations have tied us up. 'If we were in a position where we could help these teams in trouble, we would do it. But we are not allowed to. Lotus are one of three teams who have threatened to boycott the United States Grand Prix . 'If one team is given 10,000 (US dollars), everyone has to have 10,000. The trouble with lots of regulations and lots of contracts is we don't think long term.' Part of the problem is the contracts Ecclestone has negotiated over the years with the teams, which includes the distribution of revenues. The smaller marques are dismayed at how the likes of Ferrari, Red Bull, McLaren and Mercedes overwhelmingly receive the lion's share of the £900 million handed out. Ecclestone added: 'It makes no difference to me how the money is shared out. 'If they sat down here with me now and said they want to share out all of the money they get in a different way, I would say, 'Good, give me the bit of paper'. 'The problem is there is too much money being distributed badly - probably my fault - but, like lots of agreements people make, they seemed a good idea at the time.' Another issue Ecclestone faces is the teams now have too much say in the regulations, and, given so many vested interests, there is a lack of agreement. British-based Sauber are fuming at not having a say in the running of the sport . Ecclestone has a solution, but knows what the outcome would be. 'I would say to people getting a chunk of money that I would like to take a percentage of their performance-related payment,' Ecclestone said. 'I would put that money together to divide among the three or four we know are in trouble, and then I would put in the same amount of money. 'But there would not be one team that would think it was a bloody good idea. 'In the old days, the people sitting around a table would be the guys who could say yes or no. They would ask me to sort it out and it would be sorted. 'But none of the modern guys can agree anything, even if they wanted to. They all have to report back to somebody.' Although Ecclestone is effectively known as the commercial rights holder, it is private equity firm CVC Capital Partners which runs the sport - much to the apparent dismay of the teams. With Ecclestone no longer the man in overall charge, he said: 'If the company belonged to me, I would have done things in a different way. Smaller teams like Force India are struggling to make ends meet . 'That's because it would have been my money I was dealing with, but I work for people who are in the business to make money.' Another option for Ecclestone is to 'tear up all the contracts'. He added: 'I'd take all the money, pay all the teams' debts that should be paid so people haven't suffered because of Formula One, and people haven't got credit for Formula One. 'I'd then say this is what you are going to get next year, this is the amount of money we've got, and this is what is going to happen from now on in. It's percentages.' The bottom line for Ecclestone is the big teams have to yield. 'It's not the biggest crisis I've dealt with, but I'm not happy,' he said. 'It's just you are talking about larger amounts of money, so therefore it is more difficult to solve. 'We'll have to do something about it because we can't all sit back nicely, relaxed and think the problem will go away. 'It's not like having the flu and taking a few tablets and it will disappear. 'The situation is such that if enough people want it resolved, we can resolve it. 'It's a case that the people involved in the sport will have to want to look after the sport and be prepared to make some sacrifices.'","Ferrari, Red Bull, McLaren and Mercedes receive lion's share of the £900million handed out .

"Boeing's proposal to develop a so-called space taxi for NASA astronauts includes a seat for paying tourists to fly to the International Space Station, it has been revealed. The $4.2 billion, five-year contract allows Boeing to sell rides to tourists, Boeing Commercial Crew Program Manager John Mulholland told Reuters, although a price has not yet been set, . Although the exact price has not been set, Boeing said that the price would be competitive with what the Russian space agency now charges to fly tourists to the orbital outpost - around $50m. Scroll down for video . Would you pay $50m for a seat? Boeing's proposal to develop a so-called space taxi for NASA astronauts includes a seat for paying tourists to fly to the International Space Station, it has been revealed. Space Adventures is scheduled in January to begin training British singer Sarah Brightman for a 10-day visit to the station, a trip costing $52 million, according to Tom Shelley, president of Space Adventures. Brightman is slated to become the eighth paying passenger to travel to the station, a $100 billion research complex that flies about 260 miles (418 km) above Earth. 'Part of our proposal into NASA would be flying a Space Adventures spaceflight participant up to the ISS,' Mulholland said, referring to a Virginia-based space tourism company that brokers travel aboard Russian Soyuz capsules. Now that Boeing has won a share of NASA's space taxi contract, 'we hope ... to start working with the ISS program to make it happen,' he said. 'We think it would be important to help spur this industry.'

Boeing's first test launch of the taxi is not expected until 2017. But Boeing faces competition from rival Space Exploration Technologies, or SpaceX, which also won a NASA contract and says it can develop the taxi for nearly 40 percent less than Boeing. SpaceX already plans to offer trips to tourists, but did not immediately respond to questions about whether it would fly tourists on its NASA missions. An artist's rendition of the Crew Space Transportation (CST)-100 next to the International Space Station(ISS). The NASA contracts awarded on Tuesday to Boeing and SpaceX cover design, building, testing their spaceship and up to six missions to fly astronauts to the station, a pace of roughly two per year. California-based SpaceX, owned and operated by technology entrepreneur Elon Musk, says it can create and fly the taxi for $2.6 billion, compared to Boeing's $4.2 billion bid. 'I think it's a vital next step in SpaceX's progress,' Musk said in an interview on FOX Business Network. The taxi project appears to be well within Boeing's core space capabilities, which suggests it will not have trouble meeting its cost and schedule targets, analysts said. Elon Musk, CEO and CTO of SpaceX, introduces the SpaceX Dragon V2 spaceship at the SpaceX headquarters in Hawthorne. It is also expected to take tourists into orbit. Separately, Boeing and Lockheed announced on Wednesday that United Launch Alliance would invest heavily in a new rocket engine being developed by Amazon.com founder Jeff Bezos and his private company space company Blue Origin. The agreement is aimed at freeing the United States from its dependency on Russian-made engines for rockets for launches and is expected to have little effect on the space taxi. Meanwhile, SpaceX has been aggressively exploiting the price advantage of its American-made rocket to try to break ULA's monopoly on launching the U.S. military's satellites. A lawsuit contesting the Air Force's last contract with ULA is pending in a U.S. court. The company also has been successfully wooing commercial satellite launches, a business estimated to be worth $2.4 billion a year, a 2014 Satellite Industry Association study shows. So far, the company's Falcon 9 rockets have flown 12 times, all successfully.

"As Luis Suarez celebrated the goals that vanquished England on Thursday evening, the eagle-eyed among you may have noticed that the Uruguay crest on his shirt has four gold stars above it. Surely that can’t be right? We all know that Uruguay have only won the World Cup on two occasions, so surely they’ve stitched on a couple more on without really being entitled to them? After all, in FIFA’s equipment regulations, section 18.2 states: ‘Those Member Associations that have won the FIFA World Cup may put a symbol on the playing shirt representing this accomplishment and the number of times won.’ Too many stars? The crest on Luis Suarez's shirt is adorned by four stars despite Uruguay only winning the World Cup twice . And all the other nations have the correct amount - Brazil, of course, have their five stars; Italy have four; Germany three; Argentina two and England, France and Spain one apiece. It turns out that Uruguay’s badge is a bit of an anomaly, but not an unjustified one. Yes, they did win the World Cup in 1930 and 1950, as we all know, but they were twice world champions before that competition had even got off the ground. That’s because the Olympic Games - won by Uruguay in 1924 and 1928 - were officially recognised as the FIFA world championships before the World Cup as we now know it was founded in 1930. Back in 1914, Jules Rimet, the third President of the governing body and the man after whom the first World Cup trophy was named, declared: ‘Under the condition that the Olympic Football tournament be organized in agreement with FIFA rules, this competition will be recognised as a FIFA World Championship.’ History lesson: Uruguay are allowed an extra two stars because they won they won the Olympic Games in 1924 and 1928 . Their first effort to organise this in 1920 ended in farce when Czechoslovakia walked off the field in protest in the final against Belgium, but they had greater luck four years later in Paris. With more and more amateur players starting to turn professional, FIFA exploited a loophole in the rules of the strictly-amateur Olympic Movement so the best teams in the world could compete. The players would take part and technically be considered ‘amateurs’ by the International Olympic Committee as long as their own country’s Football Association compensated them for missing work. The Official History of FIFA states that the winners of these tournaments in 1924 and 1928 were therefore considered the official world champions. Uruguay were the best on the planet at the time and racked up 17 goals in four matches on their way to the gold medal match, where Switzerland were rolled over 3-0. Big difference: Uruguay's crest (left) includes four stars, while England (right) can only boast one from 1966 . Four years later, in Amsterdam, they defeated neighbours Argentina in a replay to make it back-to-back wins and secure a second gold star. The Olympic tournaments proved that a world football championship could be successfully staged and Jules Rimet soon moved to a grander vision - the World Cup. Uruguay proved quite good at that too, beating Argentina 4-2 in the 1930 final, and then stunning Brazil in the Maracana in 1950. So when FIFA revised its constitution in 1950, they formally recognised that Uruguay were four-time world champions. The badge, they will definitely feel, has been stuck with four stars for far too long. Dozens of clubs around the world incorporate stars into their crests to represent achievements. Proud: Nottingham Forest (left) and Aston Villa (right) are among the clubs to include stars on their shirts . Egypt, for example, can wear seven stars for each of their Africa Cup of Nations victories; Cameroon and Ghana wear four, while Zambia proudly marked their maiden win in 2012 with the symbol. Japan have a commemorative shirt with four stars for their Asian Cup triumphs. In England, Nottingham Forest wear two stars above their crest to mark back-to-back European Cup wins in 1979 and 1980. Aston Villa worked in a silver star to their badge to symbolise their success in 1982. The other Football League sides with stars are Bury (two for their titles in 1900 and 1903), Huddersfield (first team to win three league titles in a row between 1924 and 1926) and Ipswich (their three major trophies - league title in 1962, FA Cup in 1978 and UEFA Cup in 1981). Other clubs take it to another level - Rangers wear five, each star representing 10 Scottish titles. Juventus, meanwhile, gained their third star with a 30th Scudetto last season.","FIFA allow countries to add a star to their crest if they win the World Cup .

"Enjoyed the summer? You’re not alone: Experts have warned that homes may be set for an invasion of larger than normal spiders who have feasted on an abundance of prey in the last few months. That’s because this year the warm summer has allowed certain spiders to eat more than usual and grow to their upper limits. And it could mean we’ll see more and more large spiders in our homes in the coming months. Scroll down for video . Your new lodger: Experts say larger-than-usual house spiders (stock image shown) will head into UK homes soon. Professor Hart of the University of Gloucestershire said that the mild summer meant that more prey was available than usual. This means more spiders could grow to a larger size . The mild summer has meant the eight-legged creatures have had plenty to eat and very few have perished. With temperatures set to fall, experts from Sydney University have said the larger-than-usual house spiders will be heading indoors in the coming weeks to find a mate. Professor Adam Hart of the University of Gloucestershire agreed with their predication and said: ‘This year has been seemingly a good one for the invertebrates which spiders feed on, and it’s quite mild out there.’ Spiders are growing far larger in the city than in rural environments, researchers have said. They found that rather than thriving in areas with lots of vegetation, golden orb weaver spiders living in urban areas of Sydney, Australia, were larger and had more babies. The say city an abundance of food and city lights could be to blame. 'City-dwelling orb-weaving spiders grow larger and could produce more offspring than their country cousins our research shows,' said Elizabeth Lowe of the University of Sydney, who led the research. This study shows invertebrates are sensitive to urbanisation but that not all species are negatively affected by living in cities. Both sexes stay in their webs until the autumn when the males become nomadic and search for females. Mr Lawrence Bee of the British Arachnological Society tells MailOnline that people often notice larger spiders this year as the cold weather drives them inside, with males hunting for females. But he agrees that the particularly mild summer we’ve had, not too hot and not too cold, will have given spiders access to more prey. ‘So they are appearing a little bigger than average perhaps,’ he says. He explains that there is a maximum size that most spiders reach, and its unlikely spiders in the UK will surpass this. However it may be that there are a larger quantity of large spiders, rather than a select few spiders being abnormally large. ‘I think it’s more a situation where they are active this time of year,’ he continues. A mild summer has given spiders more prey than usual (pictured is an Araneae spider spinning a web). Spiders often head inside at this time of year as males hunt for females. But Professor Hart says there is nothing to fear because they are a 'free pest control service' ‘People are seeing them when they are obvious, and there might be more of them because last winter was quite mild. ‘The conditions have been better so there may be more around, and it’s just the fact people are seeing them more and being aware of them more. This is particularly the case for house spiders. ‘ . He adds, though, that this growth is unlikely to continue year on year, and even more large spiders will not necessarily invade homes next year. But Professor Hart said people have nothing to fear from big creepy crawlies because spiders are the a free pest control service. ‘They often feed on the most common species, preventing a few species from becoming dominant,’ he said. ‘We want to encourage people to respect and learn more about their little house guests.'","Experts say larger-than-usual house spiders will head into UK homes soon .

The same shape as a piece of paper, the memobottle is a slimline, reusable water bottle which slides into your bag to lie next to books and laptops . Creative duo Jesse Leeworthy and Jonathan Byrt, both 28, designed the bottle to be practical and environmentally friendly. It is made from a durable, dishwasher-friendly ‘green’ plastic. All three Memobottles are 1.2 inches (30mm) thick and are designed to be as durable and robust as possible. Leeworthy and Byrt from the Monington Peninsula near Melbourne, Australia say more then 600 billion single-use bottles were sold globally last year. In America alone, studies show that around 1,500 single-use water bottles are consumed every second - and only 20 per cent of these are recycled. And the cost of buying more and more plastic bottles adds up - the pair say that bottled water costs approximately 1,400 times more than tap water.

Called Ooho, the spheres can be produced in different sizes, hygienically protect the liquid inside, and cost just 2 cents (less than a penny) each. The design was crowned one of 12 winners of the second annual Lexus Design Award and is due to go on sale in Boston later this year. 'The Memobottle was designed to overcome two problems that we see in our society. 'Firstly our attachment to the outdoors and environment - we have always been disgusted with the overuse of singly use plastic bottles. 'We developed a passionate desire to reduce their usage and their disastrous effect on the environment. 'Secondly, throughout our schooling and university years, and to a larger extent our professional work life, we have been frustrated with the inability to fit water bottles in carry/laptop bags. 'Somewhere along the line, there has been a general consensus to design circular shaped bottles.

"Chatting on your phone drains its battery, but in the future, all this talk time could actually be used to boost its power. Researchers from Canada have created a chin strap that harvests energy from jaw movements, including chewing and talking. It is hoped the device could soon be used to power electronic devices, such as hearing aids, cochlear implants, and even phones.

PFC is a type of piezoelectric material made up of integrated electrodes, and an adhesive polymer matrix. The material is able to produce an electric charge when it stretches and is subjected to mechanical stress. To ensure maximum performance, the chin strap was fitted snugly to the user, so when the user’s jaw moved it caused the strap to stretch. To test the performance of the device, the subject was asked to chew gum for 60 seconds while wearing the head-mounted device. The maximum amount of power that could be harvested from the jaw movements was around 18 microwatts, but researchers claim that a realistic output is closer to 10 microwatts. This is still just a fraction of the energy used in a typical phone charger, which uses between 10 and 16 watts per day - but the strap is still in an experimental phase. In their study, researchers from Sonomax-ÉTS Industrial Research Chair in In-ear Technologies (CRITIAS) in Montreal, Canada, created an energy harvesting strap made from a single layer of PFC and attached it to a pair of ear muffs using a pair of elastic side straps. To ensure maximum performance, the chin strap was fitted snugly to the user, so when the user’s jaw moved it caused the strap to stretch. To test the performance of the device, the subject was asked to chew gum for 60 seconds while wearing the head-mounted device.

This is still just a fraction of the energy used in a typical phone charger, which uses between 10 and 16 watts per day - but the strap is still in an experimental phase. The first results of the device’s performance have been published in IOP Publishing’s journal Smart Materials and Structures. Jaw movements proved to be one of the most promising candidates for generating electricity from human body movements, with researchers estimating that an average of around seven microwatts of power could be generated from chewing during meals alone. Co-author of the study Aidin Delnavaz said: ‘Given that the average power available from chewing is around seven microwatts, we still have a long way to go before we perfect the performance of the device. To ensure maximum performance, the chin strap was fitted snugly to the user, so when the user’s jaw moved it caused the strap to stretch. The maximum amount of power harvested from the chin strap (pictured) was 18 microwatts, but researchers are working on increasing this output significantly . ‘The power level we achieved is hardly sufficient for powering electrical devices at the moment; however, we can multiply the power output by adding more PFC layers to the chin strap. 'For example, 20 PFC layers, with a total thickness of 6mm, would be able to power a 200 microwatts intelligent hearing protector. 'The only expensive part of the energy harvesting device is the single PFC layer, which costs around $20 (£12). ‘Considering the price and short lifetime of batteries, we estimate that a self-powered hearing protector based on the proposed chin strap energy harvesting device will start to pay back the investment after three years of use,’ continued Delnavaz. ‘Additionally, the device could substantially decrease the environmental impact of batteries and bring more comfort to users. ‘We will now look at ways to increase the number of piezoelectric elements in the chin strap to supply the power that small electronic devices demand, and also develop an appropriate power management circuit so that a tiny, rechargeable battery can be integrated into the device.’","The chin strap is made from a smart piezoelectric material known as PFC .

"At the current rate of deforestation, the world's rainforests could completely disappear in 100 years. Most scientists suggests fewer forests means larger amounts of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere and an increase in global warming. But a new study argues that relationship isn't as straightforward and that deforestation could in fact be cooling the planet. At the current rate of deforestation, rainforests could completely disappear in a hundred years. A new study argues  that deforestation could in fact be cooling the planet rather than contributing to global warming . Researchers at Yale University claim the process is being driven by the transformation of forests into cropland causing a net cooling effect on global temperatures. Deforestation over the last 150 years has reduced global emissions of biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs). BVOCs increase the atmospheric distribution of short-lived climate pollutants, such as methane, which have a warming influence on climate. 'Land cover changes caused by humans since the industrial and agricultural revolutions have removed natural forests and grasslands and replaced them with croplands,' said Nadine Unger, one of the researchers. Researchers at Yale University claim the process is being driven by the transformation of forests into cropland causing a net cooling effect on global temperatures . 'And croplands are not strong emitters of these BVOCs-often they don't emit any BVOCs.' The researchers used computer modelling to calculate BVOC declines and found that there has been a 30 per cent decline between 1850 and 2000, largely through the conversion of forests to cropland. Greenhouse gas levels in the atmosphere reached a record high in 2013 driven by a surge in the level of carbon dioxide, a study claims. Experts say carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations grew at the fastest rate since reliable global records began and have called for international action to combat climate change. The rise in CO2 levels is outpacing fossil fuel use, suggesting that the planet's natural ability to soak up emissions of the gas may be slowing down. ‘We know without any doubt that our climate is changing and our weather is becoming more extreme due to human activities such as the burning of fossil fuels,’ said Michel Jarraud, the Secretary General of the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) in Geneva, Switzerland. ‘It may be due to the reduced uptake of CO2 by the biosphere,' Mr Jarraud told a news conference, but said more research is needed. ‘If that is confirmed, it is of significant concern.’ This same conversion produced an overall global cooling of about 0.1°C. However, the overall global climate still warmed by about 0.6°C, mostly due to increases in fossil fuel carbon dioxide emissions. Professor Unger said the findings do not suggest that increased forest loss provides climate change benefits. Instead she claims it underscores the complexity of climate change and the importance of better assessing which parts of the world would benefit from greater forest conservation. Since the mid-19th century, the percentage of the planet covered by cropland has more than doubled, from 14 per cent to 37 per cent. Since forests are far greater contributors of BVOC emissions than crops and grasslands, this shift in land use has removed about 30 per cent of Earth's BVOC sources. Not all of these compounds affect atmospheric chemistry in the same way. Aerosols, for instance, contribute to global 'cooling' since they generally reflect solar radiation back into space. That means a 50 per cent reduction in forest aerosols has actually spurred greater warming since the pre-industrial era. However, reductions in the potent greenhouse gases methane and ozone — which contribute to global warming - have helped deliver a net cooling effect. These emissions are often ignored in climate modelling because they are perceived as a 'natural' part of the earth system, explained Professor Unger. 'So they don't get as much attention as human-generated emissions, such as fossil fuel VOCs,' she said. 'But if we change how much forest cover exists, then there is a human influence on these emissions.' This same conversion produced an overall global cooling of about 0.1°C. However, the overall global climate still warmed by about 0.6°C, mostly due to increases in fossil fuel carbon dioxide emissions .","Deforestation has reduced biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOC)

"A new species of dinosaur discovered in China might have been named after a harmless puppet, but it was a fearsome ancient predators. The remains of the long-snouted tyrannosaur nicknamed Pinocchio rex, which belonged to the same family as Tyrannosaurus rex, has been discovered by scientists. Researchers believe the animal, which stalked the Earth more than 66 million years ago, was a terrifying carnivore that lived in Asia during the late Cretaceous period. A discovery not to be sniffed at: The remains of the long-snouted tyrannosaur Qianzhousaurus sinensis - nicknamed Pinocchio rex (pictured) - which belonged to the same family as Tyrannosaurus rex, has been discovered by scientists in China . The bones were discovered by workmen on a construction site in the city of Ganzhou in southern China. They took them to a local museum, after which experts from the Chinese Academy of Geological Sciences and the University of Edinburgh became involved in examining the bones. Palaeontologists had been uncertain about the existence of long-snouted tyrannosaurs until the remains of the dinosaur - whose proper name is Qianzhousaurus sinensis - were unearthed.. With an elongated skull and long, narrow teeth, the newly-found predator would have looked very different from a T.rex, which had thick teeth and more powerful jaws. It is thought that Qianzhousaurus . sinensis lived alongside other tyrannosaurs but would not have been in . direct competition with them, since they probably hunted different prey. new species is not a lie: Palaeontologists had been uncertain about the existence of long-snouted tyrannosaurs until the remains of the dinosaur were unearthed in southern China. Just two other skeletons of juveniles have been found before but it was unclear at to whether they were a 'new' species . One of the authors of the study, Dr Steve Brusatte of Edinburgh University's School of GeoSciences, said: ‘This is a different breed of tyrannosaur. It has the familiar toothy grin of T.rex, but its snout was much longer and it had a row of horns on its nose. Junchang Lu (left) and Steve Brusatte (right), confirmed the existence of Qianzhousaurus sinensis, which belonged to the same family as T.rex . ‘It might have looked a little comical, but it would have been as deadly as any other tyrannosaur, and maybe even a little faster and stealthier.’ ‘It is an awesome specimen, almost a complete skeleton. It is a really one in a million find that those workers made.’ The newly discovered specimen is of an animal nearing adulthood. It was found largely intact and ‘remarkably well preserved, the experts said. Before this find just two fossilised tyrannosaurs with elongated heads had been pulled from the Earth, but since they were juveniles it was unclear whether they were from a new class of dinosaur or if they were simply at an early growth stage. Researchers have now created a new branch of the tyrannosaur family for specimens with very long snouts and they expect more dinosaurs to be added to the group as excavations in Asia continue to identify new species. Professor Junchang Lu, of the Institute of Geology, Chinese Academy of Geological Sciences, said: ‘The new discovery is very important. Along with Alioramus from Mongolia, it shows that the long-snouted tyrannosaurids were widely distributed in Asia. ‘Although we are only starting to learn about them, the long-snouted tyrannosaurs were apparently one of the main groups of predatory dinosaurs in Asia.’ Details of the study are published in the journal Nature Communications. Discovery: The bones were discovered by workmen on a construction site in the city of Ganzhou in southern China. They took them to a local museum, after which experts from the Chinese Academy of Geological Sciences and the University of Edinburgh became involved in examining the bones .

"An obese takeaway addict whose ankles were buckling under his 20 stone bulk has shed six stone - by eating Chinese food. Builder Matt Riggs, 35, piled on the pounds when his business was hit by the recession and he started binge eating for comfort. But he realised he had to change when he went to his GP with a suspected broken ankle but was told there was no break - he was just too heavy. Matt Riggs lost six stone in four months by cooking himself healthy versions of his favourite Chinese meals. He says at one point he was losing a pound a day. He is pictured (left) before his weight loss and (right) now . The dad-of-one had just started working in a Chinese takeaway restaurant and realised that if he took out fat he would be left with delicious, healthy food. He has now only eaten noodles and rice for four months and has lost an impressive six stone. Mr Riggs said: ‘I knew I had to sort my life out. I was eating far too many takeaways. ‘I noticed that many of the customers were overweight and was confused why the chefs at the Chinese were slim. ‘I watched the way they cooked the food they ate themselves. ‘It was basically the same but without the fat. Mr Riggs (pictured with his daughter, Cherry) weighed 20 stone before he changed his diet and he was so heavy that his ankles were being damaged. He now weighs 14 stone . ‘I had hardly ever cooked before, I would just get a takeaway or chuck something in the microwave. ‘But now I love cooking and have really enjoyed inventing my own recipes. ‘I was losing a pound every day when I first started. ‘People give up on other diets because they can't face lettuce or the other things you have to eat. ‘But with my diet you get to eat the food you like - just cooked healthily.’ At his heaviest Mr Riggs, from Bournemouth, Dorset, tipped the scales at a hefty 20st 5lbs. Mr Riggs shed the weight by cooking healthy, low-fat, versions of his favourite Chinese meals . But thanks to his new eating regime - which allows him cereal for breakfast and Rivita for lunch - he has now slimmed down to 14 stone. By swapping Chinese takeaways for home cooked versions, Mr Riggs has more than halved his fat intake. Each day he has one of his favourite Chinese dishes such as chicken chow mein, chilli chicken, Kung Po chicken or chicken chow. Mr Riggs said: 'I had hardly ever cooked before, I would just get a takeaway or chuck something in the microwave. But now I love cooking and have really enjoyed inventing my own recipes' Mr Riggs (pictured before his weight loss) believes that he has now halved his daily fat intake . An average takeaway chicken chow mein has 860 calories and 30g fat, but a home-cooked version can have just 458 calories with 15.8g fat. Mr Riggs says he has a second dieting secret - he always eats his main meal of the day before 5pm so his body has time to burn off the calories before he goes to bed. He says his wife Mel, 33, and daughter Cherry, one, have both been delighted with his new trim look. Before he went on a diet, Mr Riggs would have toast or a cooked breakfast in the morning then grab a supermarket sandwich or fast food for lunch. In the evening he would occasionally put a steak in the oven, but most of the time he stuck to microwave meals or takeaways. He would also down up to ten cans of lager a night. Nutrition scientist Dr Aine O'Connor, from the British Nutrition Foundation, said: 'When you're eating out or buying food that has been prepared for you, it's often easy to have more fat, salt and calories than you realise.' BEFORE: . Breakfast: Toast or a fry up . Lunch: A supermarket sandwich or fast food . Dinner: Microwave meals or takeaways . Drinks: Up to ten cans of lager a night . AFTER: . Breakfast: Fruit and fibre cereal . Lunch: Rivita and tuna . Dinner: Chinese meal such as salt and chilli chicken, Kung Po chicken, chicken chow mein, noodles or egg fried rice . Snacks: Fruit .","Matt Riggs weighed 20st and his weight was damaging his ankles .

"Kris Boyd has warned Celtic’s John Guidetti that, as a newcomer to the Glasgow goldfish bowl, he has no idea how hard it will be to win a high-pressure Old Firm semi final. Speaking before Saturday’s League Cup draw teed up the first Rangers and Celtic clash in almost three years, the confident Swedish striker had claimed the Parkhead side’s last-four opponents were ‘going down’. Describing the last-four draw as a shot in the arm for the Scottish game, however, Boyd cautioned his Celtic counterpart that an Old Firm cup tie is unlike anything he will ever have experienced in football before. Celtic striker John Guidetti will play in his first Old Firm clash with Rangers in the League Cup sem-final . Rangers' Kris Boyd (right), pictured playing against Dumbarton, says Guidetti will not know what to expect . ‘Good for John Guidetti,’ said the Ibrox striker after news of the city rivals’ first meeting since April 2012 filtered through, ‘but that’s someone speaking who has never played in an Old Firm game before and who doesn’t know what he’s in for. ‘I don’t think it makes sense for anyone to stand up and say they’re going to steamroller teams, or do this or that, or such-and-such is going down. ‘Until you’ve played in that Old Firm fixture you don’t know what it takes and anyone can win those games on the day.’ Boyd reckons that a Rangers old guard featuring himself Kenny Miller, Lee McCulloch and Lee Wallace could give his side the edge in the semi-final. Boyd (right) has played in Old Firm matches before, including scoring in May 2007, and says they are unique . Perhaps there was a failure on his part to acknowledge the fact that Celtic also have a group of Old Firm veterans featuring the likes of skipper Scott Brown, Kris Commons, Adam Matthews, Emilio Izaguirre and Beram Kayal. But Boyd, clearly of the belief that the Ibrox side have performers who have been more steeped in the fixture over time, insisted: ‘We’ve got five or six players who have played in Old Firm games before. I’m not so sure about Celtic. It can be an advantage because you know exactly what you’re going into. ‘Celtic will be confident but if anyone was jumping around their dressing room at news of the draw then I’d bet it was none of those who have played in it - it will be those who don’t really know what it takes. We’ll see what happens when it comes around.’ Ally McCoist's Rangers, in action against Hearts, are currently playing in the Scottish Championship . A level of campaign weariness is likely before the tie finally comes around in three months’ time - with the Hampden showdown taking place on either January 31 or February 1 - but Boyd believes the resumption of old hostilities after so long on the backburner is good news for a Scottish game which has been divided and scarred following the Ibrox club’s financial demise in 2012. ‘It’s great,’ said the 31-year-old striker. ‘The whole of Scottish football needs this fixture. It’s a great opportunity for the two biggest clubs in the country to go head to head again. ‘We know that we’re still a division below Celtic, but we look forward to the game. It’s something for people to look forward to. ‘There’s not been a lot to talk about in Scottish football in the last couple of years in terms of Rangers and Celtic. ‘There has been a lot of negativity because they haven’t been playing each other - and it gives us an opportunity to build up what should hopefully be a tremendous game. ‘It’s a chance for us to show that Scottish football isn’t dead. Celtic players celebrate during their 3-0 win over rivals Rangers back in April 2012 in the Scottish Premiership . ‘We’re still massive clubs worldwide and we want to go and put on a performance - but we know that we need to be at our best if we’re to have any chance of beating them. ‘People will write us off but we’re confident going into any game with the players we’ve got here. ‘I think everyone in the dressing room will be looking forward to the Celtic game. For us, it’s a difficult game and Celtic will go in as favourites. ‘But we know that if we play at our best then we can give anyone in Scotland a game. But, for us, the main focus is showing our league form of the last couple of months.’ Reacting to a school of thought that the pressure is all on Ronny Deila’s men - given their continued prominence in the Scottish game - Boyd was dismissive of any such suggestion and insisted that no Rangers player ever goes into a game without the weight of expectation on his shoulder. Celtic players celebrate their impressive 6-0 win over Partick Thistle in the League Cup on Wednesday . Speaking after scoring his eighth goal of the season in a 1-0 Scottish Cup win at Dumbarton on Saturday, the frontman added: ‘As soon as you pull on that blue jersey you never accept defeat so the pressure is also on us despite being underdogs. ‘The responsibility of being a Rangers player is that you need to win. It will be a massive game but I can’t emphasise enough how much our focus needs to be getting back into the top flight. ‘We want four, five, six Old Firm games a season and that will only happen once Rangers get back to the top and if you draw each other in the Cups. ‘The most important thing right now is to focus on the league and to get back to the Premiership. ‘We’ve got a massive game coming up against Hearts at the end of the month and before that we’ve got Cowdenbeath on Tuesday night and Alloa and Falkirk at home where we’ll be looking to keep the pressure on Hearts.’ Gary Hooper completed the scoring during Celtic's 3-0 win over Rangers in the last Old Firm derby in 2012 .","Rangers face Celtic in Old Firm clash at the end of January .

"LOCKED IN by Richard Marsh and Jeff Hudson (Piatkus, £12.99) ‘Don't do it! I’m begging you. Please, don’t kill me!’ Inside his head, Richard Marsh screamed the words. But no sound came from his mouth. After a major stroke, the 60-year-old former policeman-turned-teacher was in intensive care, paralysed, unable to move a single part of his body. To the outside world, he appeared dead, hence the conversation going on between his wife, Lili, and the doctor. ‘Rich has been here for two days, and shown no sign of improvement,’ said the doctor. ‘He has less than a 2 per cent chance of surviving two days.’ He explained how Richard’s body had shut down — his internal organs operational only with the aid of machines, his brain all but switched off, as it had been starved of oxygen. Richard Marsh is lucky to be alive after a stroke left him paralysed and able to communicate only by blinking . As Richard lay there, he was cruelly aware of a discussion he and Lili had had some months earlier. If either was ever in the state the doctor had just described, the other would agree to life support being terminated. There was a tense few minutes while Lili considered. Finally, she said she’d like to consult Rich’s three grown-up daughters. She’d tell the doctor tomorrow. Through the longest night of his life, Rich imagined the arguments that would decide his fate batting back and forth at home. Earlier, he’d come as close as anyone can to being at his own funeral, as family members trooped in to say farewell. His best friend Steve had made a 750-mile journey, touching Rich gently and saying: ‘Goodbye, old friend.’ But the funeral never happened. Waking after the stroke, Rich was relieved to hear the rise and fall of his breath. He decided to test it by holding his breath, and found the rhythm of his breathing continued — a machine was doing it for him. He tried to turn his head, but his neck was unresponsive; likewise, his arms, his legs and eyelids. Yet he could hear everything that was going on around him. 90% of those with locked-in syndrome die within four months . Remarkably, the first improvement came during that night, as he lay with the TV on. Eventually, the bright lights on the screen began to hurt his eyes. So, he blinked. His eyelids had been opening and closing involuntarily. But this was the first time he had controlled the movement. He just needed to be able to do it when someone was watching, in order to save his life. Next day, Lili told the doctors the family wasn’t ready to pull the plug. Then, one of the doctors began staring at Rich. He’d seen him blink. A neurologist was summoned, who said: ‘Rich, if you can hear me, blink for “yes”.’ He obliged. Rich was told he had locked-in syndrome. If he stayed alive, his condition would be all but unbearable. But the blinking proved the first of many small steps towards recovery, and enabled him to communicate via blinking at letters on a white board. he was given intensive physiotherapy on his legs and arms to prevent his muscles atrophying, and restore muscle memory. When he moved his tongue, the staff started him on speech therapy. After three-and-a-half months, he was able to mumble: ‘Thanks.’ Seven months after his stroke, he had almost fully recovered. Three years later, he’s visiting the gym and cycling everywhere. Locked In is Rich’s story of what this terrifying condition is actually like, and how he survived.","After a major stroke, the 60-year-old former policeman-turned-teacher was in intensive care,  unable to move a single part of his body .

"JOE AND MARILYN: LEGENDS IN LOVE by C. David Heymann (Simon & Schuster, £17.99) The undulating Marilyn Monroe may or may not have been a daffy comic actress of offbeat genius — what C. David Heymann calls her ‘soft simplicity’ could equally have been the consequence of drugs, rather than talent. But what is beyond dispute is that she had terrible taste in men, illogically believing that, if a chap slapped her around, this ‘confirmed for her just how much he cared about her’. ‘I can’t remember the names of three-quarters of the men I slept with,’ Marilyn once said — though she never forgot Albert Einstein, because he managed to give her the slip. Voice coaches, wig makers, casting agents, Sinatra, Brando, and numerous Kennedys: it was a catholic list. Marilyn Monroe with second husband Joe DiMaggio, a controlling and uncaring brute who drove her to overdosing on powerful sedatives . The ill-fated pair arriving at a theatre together in 1955. Their marriage broke down after just two years. ‘Hollywood,’ Marilyn quickly learned, ‘wasn’t a place where an ambitious starlet could afford to be a prude.’ Maybe not, but a dip into the actress’s past suggests that what she hopelessly sought was a father figure — ‘paternalistic guidance’. Marilyn had needed considerable strength of character to survive an upbringing that involved suicide, illegitimacy, incest and schizophrenia. Her mother was in the State Asylum, where she remained until 1967, five years after her daughter’s death. Marilyn herself was sent to the Los Angeles Orphans Home. ‘Nobody ever treated Marilyn like a real daughter,’ says Heymann. ‘Nobody had ever held her. No one kissed her. Nobody.’ Not with genuine warmth and affection, anyway. Enter Joe DiMaggio, 12 years her senior. He had been star centre-fielder for the New York Yankees, baseball’s greatest living legend, who’d won nine World Series championships and was the holder of a 56-consecutive-game hitting streak. He seemed a solid sort, who’d ‘combat Marilyn’s shortcomings and frailties’. But he was also a colossal bore, as sports heroes tend to be. He once went to the Metropolitan Museum and came out saying, ‘art bores me to tears’. He now did nothing but drink, watch TV and chain-smoke. Joe and Marilyn pictured arriving in New York from Tampa, Florida in 1961. The former baseball player disliked Marilyn wearing what he deemed to be provocative clothing. Marilyn met him in 1952, and they were married two years later. She made the mistake of imagining his taciturnity masked fascinating depths. ‘If his remoteness somehow annoyed her, it also served to pique her interest,’ says Heymann, who is as unconvinced as I am about DiMaggio’s psychological enigma. After a fashion, the couple did have something in common — Marilyn was mobbed by fans and reasoned that ‘movie stars aren’t born, they’re created. Publicity is part of the manufacturing process’. DiMaggio, in his turn, had also known adulation. He almost grew wistful as he recalled the atmosphere in the stadium, ‘having millions of people look at you with love and excitement while you stand alone getting ready to do something’. Joe DiMaggio was the star centre-fielder for the New York Yankees and loved the attention that fame brought him . Here may be the place to mention another thing that drew Marilyn to him: ‘Joe’s biggest bat isn’t the one he used at the plate,’ she told Truman Capote. DiMaggio was the son of a crab fisherman from San Francisco. He dropped out of school in 1930 to play baseball, and was known as ‘the Walloping Wop’. He’d been married before, to a singer called Dorothy Olson. If only Marilyn had found out more about this episode. DiMaggio had grown to hate Dorothy for ‘playing the effervescent hostess to family and friends’, and begrudged her any personality of her own. A woman, to his Neanderthal way of thinking, had to cook, clean, run errands, ‘be his sex partner when he wasn’t in bed with someone else. It didn’t seem to occur to him that Dorothy might have her own needs’. They were divorced in 1944 on the ground of his ‘cruel indifference’. History repeated itself with Marilyn. Joe would scream at her if she wore a swimsuit — accusing her of looking like a whore. To him, women were always housewives or whores, nothing in between. He insisted Marilyn wore dresses with high necklines, and wanted to prevent her from appearing in films ‘that exploited her sexuality’. He expected clauses in her contracts to that effect, and demanded ‘an active voice in choosing her roles’. DiMaggio read and screened Marilyn’s fan mail and didn’t like it when she had to kiss the leading man. He tried to control her and, of all the people in the world, she was the one you couldn’t control — certainly not by force. The tragedy is that, just at the very moment Marilyn was emerging as ‘a shot in the arm for Hollywood’ and world cinema, her boorish husband was intent on compelling and browbeating her to ‘quit making movies to start a family, have babies’. DiMaggio had violent tantrums: ‘He made such a racket and screamed so loudly that guests in a nearby room called the front desk.’ Marilyn Monroe's coffin is brought out at her funeral. The iconic beauty died of a sedative overdose . Marilyn would appear in the morning with her face swollen and her eyes red. ‘Joe kept her up all night, every night, yelling and screaming at her. He’d become an erupting volcano, spewing out lava and ash.’ Enraged because ‘his bride had surpassed him in popularity and renown’, DiMaggio did his best to destroy Marilyn as an artist. She began showing up late, upsetting the director and producers. ‘She started taking sedatives. . . she became addicted and began drinking, and the combination of alcohol and pharmaceuticals screwed her up.’ She couldn’t remember lines ‘or if she did, she’d slur them’. She would collapse, develop bronchial ailments. Delays cost studios a small fortune. What DiMaggio saw as ‘the sanctity of a domestic partnership’ was thoroughly abusive, despite the romantic nonsense of telegrams, champagne and florists delivering a bouquet of roses twice a day when he was trying to patch things up. Marilyn Monroe in her prime (left) and Joe DiMaggio's first wife, actress Dorothy Wilson (right) His cycles of jealous paranoia and possessiveness didn’t stop when they got divorced after only 286 days, in October 1954. DiMaggio stalked and intimidated Marilyn, even breaking into her apartment — or what he thought was hers. A distraught Mrs Florence Kotz filed a suit against him for ‘attempted burglary’. Marilyn went on to marry Arthur Miller in 1956 — another disaster. Heymann calls the playwright ‘cold-hearted, dispassionate, intellectually pretentious, cheap and afraid to give of himself. He had no sense of humour’. Marilyn inadvertently killed herself in 1962 when she forgot how many pills she’d taken, so took some more for good measure. There were enough Nembutal sedatives in her cabinet ‘to have killed a herd of cattle’. DiMaggio, who’d driven her to drug-taking in the first place, died of lung cancer in 1999. In his later years, he kept company with a mannequin of Marilyn, complete with ‘an almost indecent authenticity to the breasts and other erogenous zones’, which he’d designed and had manufactured for $10,000. He finally had the wife he always wanted — a silent and obedient rubber doll.

"Virgil van Dijk insists that defeating Rangers would make a potential Treble taste even sweeter for Celtic this season. The Glasgow giants will lock horns for the first time in almost three years when they descend on Hampden on January 31 or February 1 for the League Cup semi-final. It’s the first time the teams will have met since Celtic won 3-0 at Parkhead on 29 April 2012 - with Rangers’ subsequent financial meltdown putting the fixture into cold storage for two-and-a-half seasons. Virgil van Dijk cannot wait to face Rangers in the League Cup semi-final at Hampden Park for Celtic . Celtic players celebrate their impressive 6-0 win over Partick Thistle in the League Cup on Wednesday . Ronny Deila’s side will undoubtedly start favourites for the hotly-anticipated clash, with Rangers still off the pace in the Championship race. And, having helped Celtic to a fifth successive win against Inverness on Saturday, Van Dijk believes defeating the Ibrox club en route to the first showpiece occasion of the season would lend ever greater kudos to the prospect of a domestic clean sweep. ‘Yeah, it would make it more special if we beat Rangers on the way to winning the League Cup,’ the Dutchman said. ‘We want to win the Treble this season. If we beat Rangers, we will be in the final of the first trophy we can win. That’s what we want. ‘The semi-final is going to be an amazing game. I wasn’t really expecting to play games against Rangers when I signed for Celtic. I knew we could always meet them in a cup, but I didn’t think about it a lot. ‘But of course you want to play in that fixture because it is unbelievable, with everything around it. Ally McCoist's Rangers, in action against Hearts, are currently playing in the Scottish Championship . Celtic players celebrate during their 3-0 win over rivals Rangers back in April 2012 in the Scottish Premiership . ‘Everyone wants to experience this game - and win it, of course, which is the most important thing. We have a lot of games before that one comes around, though, so we need to focus on them first.’ Despite having been in four knock-out competitions since 2012, the Glasgow giants had been kept apart until Saturday’s live TV draw paired them together, with holders Aberdeen and high-flying Dundee United fighting it out in the other half of the draw. Celtic boss Deila made no secret of his delight at being handed the prospect of experiencing an Old Firm game in his first season at Parkhead - with a loud cheer from the dressing room on Saturday leaving no one in any doubt as to the feelings of his players. John Guidetti, Saturday’s match-winner, has already stated that whoever Celtic landed in the draw would be ‘going down’ - a view subsequently endorsed by van Dijk. ‘It means a lot to everyone here,’ said the 23-year-old defender. ‘Winning it is the most important thing - it doesn’t matter how. We will be up for it. ‘We want to win the League Cup. What John said was true, it doesn’t matter who we play in the tournament, we need to win. But of course it makes it more special that we play Rangers.

"She's a glamorous mother-of-two, feted for her fashion nous and extensive charity work, but now Spain's Queen Letizia has had a tribute of a very different kind - a Simpsons style makeover. The Spanish monarch has been transformed into a cartoon character by Italian artist Alexsandro  Palombo, who says the royal has impressed him with her 'strength' and 'determination'. 'Queen Letizia perfectly represents the ideal modern woman,' he added. 'She's strong, determined and committed to supporting important social causes.' Admirer: Palombo says he admires Letizia's strength and determination, as well as her charity work . Her strength and determination certainly come across in Palombo's cartoons, which include one that shows her riding a bull while in full military uniform. Another shows her in one of her trademark glamorous gowns standing in front of the Zarzuela Palace with a mini bull on a lead. 'She has a fresh, cool look which is far from the usual royal aesthetic,' explains Palombo. 'I think it's very important that there are women like her in our society in order to support important ideals such as equal rights between men and women.' But Letizia isn't the first royal lady to feature in Palombo's work. His last project gave the Duchess of Cambridge a Simpsons-style makeover and the Queen has herself been featured in a Springfield-inspired cartoon. Hard at work: Despite it being her 42nd birthday, Queen Letizia spent the day at a journalism awards ceremony . Resemblance: Palombo's purple frock bears more than a slight resemblance to this 2009 look (left) His pen has also touched on famous beauties such as Kim Kardashian as well as iconic fashion designer Karl Lagerfeld and US Vogue editor, Anna Wintour. 'I captured the essence of her femininity and I've chosen outfits that represent her style,' added Palombo. 'She has an elegant personality but at the same time she is a bit irreverent, so she is perfect for an episode of The Simpsons.' Letizia, who celebrated her 42nd birthday yesterday, spent the day hard at work, attending the Luis Carandell Journalism Awards ceremony at the Senate Palace in Madrid and making a speech. Stylish: Palombo says he wanted to remain true to Letizia's chic, tailored style and immaculate looks . Non-stop: Letizia's appearance at the Luis Carandell Journalism Awards was the latest stop in a busy schedule . Resplendent in a rose print lilac and cream dress, the mother-of-two looked every inch the queen as she spoke to guests. Her latest appearance comes hot on the heels of a frenetic week, which included a visit from the president and first lady of Panama and several charity meetings. On Friday, she dressed down in a simple grey t-shirt and jeans as she and husband King Felipe, 46, took their daughters Leonor and Sofia to school as the new academic year began. The rest of the month is also set to be a busy one for Letizia and her husband courtesy of a busy schedule of appointments at home, before a visit to New York at the end of September where Felipe will address the UN General Assembly. Past princesses: Palombo has also turned the Queen and the Duchess of Cambridge into Simpsons in his work .

"The worst goal drought in Aston Villa’s history has wiped away the euphoria over the club’s best start to a Premier League campaign since 1998. Five consecutive goalless defeats have helped propel manager Paul Lambert to bookies’ favourite as the next Premier League sacking. Lambert might be expected to regard the new four-year contract in his back pocket as a guarantee of job security, given it was only signed in September. Aston Villa manager Paul Lambert says he has never felt comfortable as a manager and always lives in fear . Lambert remains defiant against the criticism he has received following a run  of five straight goalless defeats . Yet the Villa boss heads into Sunday's home fixture against Tottenham disputing the presence of a safety net. Instead Lambert insists he is living in fear. ‘I enjoy living on the edge,’ said Lambert. ‘There are two ways of going about it: you can come in fighting or run. And I’m never going to run. ‘I know what the game is like. I have never felt comfortable as a manager. I always live in fear. That’s what I like. ‘You have to come through it. It goes from one manager to the next. If you look at which manager is under pressure it is one guy one week, the next the next and another the following week. Everyone gets a hit at it. ‘It’s just the way football works – you just have to turn it around.’ Striker Gabriel Agbonlahor has chipped in with just two goals in eight Premier League appearances for Villa . Andreas Weimann joins Agbonlahor on the top scorers list at Villa but has not netted since the end of August . Christian Benteke continued his recovery from injury by starting a second consecutive league game at QPR . Owner Randy Lerner believed in Lambert six weeks ago but there is a fan base who increasingly need convincing. Losing tomorrow would begin to exert pressure on the chairman too. The argument from the manager is that Villa lost to Manchester City, Arsenal, Chelsea and Everton before Monday’s damaging fifth defeat at then-bottom club QPR. ‘We’ve played nine games and this will be our sixth game against last year’s top six,’ added Lambert. The striker came close scoring at Loftus Road but is still in search of his first Premier League goal this season . ‘I’ve been in this position loads of times, even as a player. But you can’t wilt under the pressure. If you are not being criticised people don’t talk about you. You take it. ‘I’m not one to sit on my backside doing nothing. It’s not about monetary things or anything like that, I just want to do my best for this football club. I want to drive it on. ‘I’m not one for sitting comfortably, never.’","Aston Villa have failed to score a single league goal in their last five games .

"When police raided celebrated artist Graham Ovenden’s home searching for child pornography in 1993, the art world rushed to his defence. His soft-focus, sexually suggestive paintings of naked young girls were found distasteful by many. But his illustrious supporters backed his insistence that ‘the pervert is the one who puts the fig leaf on, not the one who takes it off’. Leading artist David Hockney, . Ovenden’s former tutor Sir Peter Blake, writer Laurie Lee and the . photographer Lucinda Lambton were among those who proclaimed his . innocence. Guilty: Graham Ovenden, 70, was today convicted of four counts of indecency with a child by a jury at Truro Crown Court . Eventually the photographs seized by the police were returned and Ovenden escaped charge. Last night however the artist’s mask . of respectability was ripped off for good after he was convicted of a . string of sex offences against three young girls who posed for him as . models. As critics pointed out, his portrait painting had been a ruse to aid his abuse of children. Ovenden, 70, faces jail after being found guilty of six counts of indecency with a child and one count of indecently assaulting a child. The court heard his victims were aged between six and 14 when he abused them after blindfolding them and dressing them in Victorian nightgowns. Now adult women, the victims told how he abused them between 1972 and 1985 at his home studios in London and Cornwall. In some cases the girls were photographed indecently at the same time – and resulting portraits of at least one was then exhibited. At the peak of his popularity, Ovenden’s paintings sold for £25,000-a-time and were displayed at London’s Victoria and Albert Museum and the Tate, and the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. But his victims will be mystified as to why it took almost 20 years to finally bring him to justice. Guilty: Ovenden pictured in his Bodmin studio . During . his three-week trial at Truro Crown Court, Ovenden accepted he had . taken photographs of scantily clad and naked children, but denied they . were indecent and insisted he had not interfered with any of his . underage models. However, prosecutor Ramsay Quaife said his victims gave strikingly similar accounts of abuse. The jury was told he would dress them in Victorian-style nightgowns, then blindfold them and strip them naked. He would abuse them when their eyes were taped shut. Another . complainant said she was aged just six and was in a bath with another . girl when the artist got in with them and forced her to touch him. Arrogant . Ovenden, who graduated from the Royal College of Art in 1968, appeared . to revel in the opportunity to defend himself and his art when giving . evidence. He boasted he was ‘one of the world’s greatest printers’ and in his defence quoted references from the Bible and his own books. Ovenden . claimed he was the victim of a ‘witch hunt’ against artists brave . enough to capture naked children in ‘the state of grace’ and told police . he had created ‘some of the best portraits of children in the last 200 . years’. When Mr Quaife said . ‘utterly vile’ images found on the artist’s computer showed his talk of . high art was just a ‘convenient cover story’ for paedophilia, Ovenden . said the only problem was the barrister’s ‘visual illiteracy’. Mr Quaife said: ‘The truth is you’re sexually besotted with young girls. The proof of your obsessions are your images.’ Ovenden, who lives near Bodmin Moor in Cornwall, was not in court to hear the verdicts after being taken ill at the weekend. Judge Graham Cottle adjourned sentence. The artist was found not guilty of abusing a fourth girl. In 1995 the Daily Mail revealed detectives had been incensed by the decision to drop child porn ring charges against Ovenden. Three years ago he was cleared of 34 child porn charges. Accused: Ovenden, 70, still faces five further charges but the jury are still deciding their verdicts . In the courtroom, Graham Ovenden painted a picture of 'one of the world’s greatest printers', an artist held in such high esteem his works were hung in the finest galleries across the world. Under the early tutelage of the 'godfather of Pop Art' Sir Peter Blake, Ovenden embarked on a career which catalogued life on the streets of London, offered acclaimed landscapes of the countryside, and portraiture of children. He had been tutored by Lord David Cecil and Sir John Betjeman, attended the Southampton School of Art, and graduated from the Royal College of Art in 1968. His work was displayed across the world, including exhibitions at London’s Victoria and Albert Museum, The Tate and the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. In 1975 he founded the artistic movement the Brotherhood of Ruralists - artists who had left the city to live in the countryside. At Barley Splatt, his sprawling estate in the shadow of Bodmin Moor in north Cornwall, greats of the art world would mingle and share ideas with each other, while parents - often single mothers and their children - were also welcome visitors to the property. But by 2013, and long after the height of Ovenden’s popularity had faded against a backdrop of police investigations for indecency, the artist’s stories of working alongside some of the country’s most celebrated visionaries seems like a distant memory. He remains at Barley Splatt, but in a converted outbuilding next to the turreted main home, known as The Garage. His son is estranged, while friends say Ovenden has not sold a painting for some time. Ill health has dogged the 70-year-old, though his acerbic wit has not deserted him. Appearing to revel under the spotlight of giving evidence in his own trial, the bespectacled Ovenden would summon references to the Bible, and to the great authors of times past, in an effort to support his point - that his work, which sometimes featured nude children, was something to behold with admiration as so many had done before, rather than something on which the case against him could be partly based. He also described the 'witch-hunt' against artists brave enough to capture children in 'the state of grace'. During one chapter of the three-week trial, Ovenden even quoted from one of his own books, taking time to read a poem to the jury. Frequently, calmly, he denied repeated prosecution claims that he is a paedophile - that his work demonstrated a sexual interest in children, and that he acted under the veneer of respectability. Ovenden would describe prosecutor Ramsay Quaife’s 'visual illiteracy', and would also cite a 'day of reckoning' for the police, including barbed allegations about members of the Metropolitan Police Force who brought the claims against him. Outside the court, during the days of evidence, Ovenden and his supporters said a dossier of evidence would be uploaded to the internet once the trial was over to support his veiled accusations against the police. In convicting him of sexual offences against children, the jury decided the world had heard enough lies.","Ovenden, 70, not in court for verdict because he had been taken ill .

Earlier, Sportsmail revealed that Arsenal initiated first contact with the Colombia star's advisers on Friday, informing them of their desire to take the striker on loan, not a permanent deal. The Gunners have been quoted a £8.5million loan fee and a further £10.4m in wages. City's bid to land  Falcao, meanwhile, was handed a timely boost after Alvaro Negredo agreed to join Valencia on Sunday night. The Premier League champions have been offered the Monaco forward as have their neighbours United have also been handed the opportunity to sign the 28-year-old and the Old Trafford club are monitoring the situation. Falcao had looked set to join Real Madrid after posting - and then deleting - a tweet saying as much on Saturday night. But Real boss Carlo Ancelotti instead moved to sign  United's Javier Hernandez on loan on a fast-paced day before the deadline in which Falcao appeared to be offered to a plethora of clubs across Europe.

"Neil Redfearn continues to wait to sign a contract to be the third permanent Leeds boss of the season but says he is 'very close' to doing so. The 49-year-old has been the man-in-waiting to replace the sacked Darko Milanic since the Slovenian was dispensed with on Saturday, but talks with controversial president Massimo Cellino have yet to yield a contract. Stepping up from his secure role with the club's academy is seen as a dangerous move for the club's perennial caretaker, owing to Cellino's propensity to fire coaches. He sacked 36 in 22 years with Cagliari and has seen off three in five months at Leeds. Neil Redfearn is expected to take permanent charge of Leeds United in the coming days . Redfearn is currently preparing his team for the weekend, but has not yet signed a contract . Redfearn was asked to return to the dugout when Milanic bit the dust after only 32 days and is preparing the side for Saturday's game at Cardiff but, as things stand, he does not know if that will be in a caretaker or full-time capacity. 'It's very close,' the former Barnsley midfielder said on Thursday. 'I had a good chat with Massimo yesterday and we went through one or two things. It's not that far away. 'I wanted some assurances from the conversations I had, where he saw me at the club and the club going forward. He said I was the future and I wanted to know if that was still the case. He said ""you are"". I wanted the contract to reflect certain things.' One of those granted assurances is that Redfearn will return to his role at the head of the academy if Cellino's impatient streak resurfaces, but the former is not considering the negative option. Redfearn is waiting for assurances that he can resume his job in the academy if the role does not work out . Leeds owner Massimo Cellino appointed Darko Milanic last month, but sacked him after just 32 days . Slovenian Milanic was appointed on a two-year deal but did not even last two months at Elland . 'It seems to be shorter here (a coach's life) but you can spend the rest of your life wondering. You have to go on and make things happen and be positive. There's no let up now. 'This is a massive honour. It's a massive football club with a great tradition and the owner has a desire to make it great (again). I can see that, that's a genuine opinion from me and if I can be part of that down the line it's a fantastic honour. I'm capable of doing it now it's a case of knuckling down and concentrating on the footy.' A lifelong Leeds fan, Redfearn's ascent to the top job at Elland Road has been a slow one, having joined the club's academy staff in 2009. He has had four caretaker spells since then and resisted interest from other clubs in order to remain with Leeds. But, even if things do not work out with the first team, he is sure he will continue to enjoy working at his boyhood club. Cellino reacts while watching a recent game alongside Redfearn, who he is expected to appoint permanently . 'I would be happy taking the Under-11s,' he added. 'Massimo sees me here for the long haul but there are no guarantees in football. If it was as easy as guaranteeing wins we would all be managers. It's got to be worked at and earned and I know that as well. 'The bigger picture is whatever happens needs to be for the good of Leeds United. If it takes me on, great, if it doesn't I will be back with the academy.' Redfearn said it would be a 'massive honour' to manage the club, but admits he is just happy to be involved . Cellino is a notoriously fiery character and a story emerged in Italy this week of former Cagliari coach Nedo Sonneti claiming he was shown the door for eating a seabass. Redfearn acknowledges his boss has a passionate side, but is ready to give as good as he gets along the way. 'He tells me what he thinks!,' Redfearn said. 'But I give it back to him and he wants to know. He's strong, but we get on well. He knows I am strong and we have to make it work together.'","Neil Redfearn in temporary charge after Darko Milanic sacked after 32 days .

"Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger has criticised changes being made to Champions League seedings for next season. UEFA is to implement a radical overhaul that will see the holders, alongside the league champions from the seven top-ranked nations, placed in pot one. Teams are currently seeded according to performances in the Champions League and Europa League rather than domestic competitions. Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger does not agree with the changes being implemented by UEFA . The change has been agreed on the basis on 'sporting merit' and could mean some of the biggest and historically most successful clubs in Europe clashing as early as the group stages. It will also eliminate the possibility of teams from a small number of countries dominating the top seedings. Wenger, speaking ahead of Tuesday night's Group D showdown against Anderlecht at the Emirates Stadium, believes the new method is misguided. 'It's not needed because it's a competition that works best in the world and is most admired. Everyone wants to watch it,' Wenger said. Michel Platini and UEFA are making changes to the way the Champions League seedings work . 'I was quite surprised that they've done that. We'll see how it works. I believe it will just make the seedings useless. 'Logic is not being respected. Logic for me when you play in Europe is results in Europe. 'I'm not really fighting it because it will just make the seeding less interesting. Group one will now have less significance.' Arsenal are three points behind Group D leaders Borussia Dortmund in second place and need to beat Anderlecht for the second time in two weeks to keep snapping at the German club's heals. This year's champions will go into pot one next season with league champions from Europe's best leagues . The Gunners have spluttered through the opening stage of the season despite the £35million arrival of Alexis Sanchez, and Wenger knows there is room for improvement. 'Our attitude and dedication have been fantastic, but on the efficiency front we can do better,' Wenger said. 'We have created many chances and our finishing has not always been at the expected level. 'We give very few chances away but those that we have given away are of quality, and that is what we want to do better.'","UEFA are changing the rules for Champions League seeding .

"An aspiring model says the overwhelming support she received from her Facebook friends is the secret behind her cancer recovery. Caris Hedd-Bowen, who has 2,127 friends on the social networking website, was told she had Hodgkin’s lymphoma in January after doctors spotted a lump on her chest. Within days of being diagnosed, she began a gruelling chemotherapy regime in an attempt to tackle the cancer. Caris Hedd-Bowen, 22, was diagnosed with Hodgkin's lymphoma in January when she was just 21. She turned to her 2,127 Facebook friends for support . Ms Hedd-Bowen said: ‘I couldn’t believe it. I was only 21 and my head filled with a thousand thoughts, including the faces of my two sons Travis and Finley, when I was diagnosed. ‘It was heart-breaking to think I may not be around to watch my boys grow up. I knew I had to get on with it and beat it.’ As a way of dealing with the stress, Ms Hedd-Bowen, now 22, shared her fight with contacts on Facebook, and was amazed by the feedback she received. She said: ‘Within minutes, people - people I didn’t even know - were messaging me with supportive comments, saying I looked beautiful, and willing me to keep fighting. ‘It was amazing, and more than once the response of people on Facebook had me in tears. I couldn’t believe how kind everyone was, even complete strangers. ‘I have amazing family and friends, but there were times I felt terribly alone during my treatment. I had to spend time away from my sons and of course I felt ill a lot of the time during my chemotherapy. She was given the all-clear earlier this month after a CT scan showed she was cancer free. She shared the news with her Facebook friends by posting this picture of herself on a beach . Ms Hedd-Bowen says that when she was diagnosed her first thought was that she might not live to see her sons, Travis, seven, and Finley, five, grow up . ‘Facebook has helped me in ways I can’t describe. Whenever I felt low, I would post a picture of me wearing a variety of different wigs, or bald pictures to show how I was losing my hair. The response was incredible.’ Ms Hedd-Bowen, who hopes to model full-time, knew which kind of photographs her followers would find most interesting. She said: ‘Soon, Facebook became my crutch. I would post pictures of me in hospital, I would update people on my progress, and I made sure I was 100 per cent honest about how I was feeling and coping with it all. Ms Hedd-Bowen said: 'It was heart-breaking to think I may not be around to watch my boys grow up. I knew I had to get on with it and beat it' ‘Every chemotherapy day I would get dolled up and take a photo as I was plugged in to the machine, smiling and happy as ever because I was grateful to be alive. ‘People never let me down - lovely comforting comments were streaming in, as well as hundreds of likes on my posts and pictures. ‘It was such an amazing lift to read things like that while I was feeling ill and emotional. It gave me a daily boost and reminded me to keep fighting.’ In June Ms Hedd-Bowen, of Pembrey, South Wales, was told the news she was in remission. She announced this to her army of friends through a series of status updates. Ms Hedd-Bowen says that the responses and messages she received on Facebook were so overwhelmingly kind that they often left her in tears . She wrote: ‘Guess what? I have well and truly kicked cancer’s ass! I am cancer free!’ She also posted a photograph of her lying on the beach with the words ‘I beat cancer’. This month she told her friends: ‘Just received a letter from the hospital saying my CT scan that I had two weeks ago has come back totally clear. It’s definitely 100 per cent gone! Yay!’ Responses included messages of congratulations and a torrent of smiley faces. She said: ‘Grateful doesn’t begin to cover how I felt. I took a few minutes to phone my family and a few of my friends, and then I declared my fight was over on Facebook. Ms Hedd-Bowen says that Facebook became her 'crutch' as it gave her the daily boost she needed to keep fighting. She says she is extremely grateful for all of the support she received . ‘My status got more than 600 likes, which was amazing. ‘I had a final CT scan and two more chemotherapy sessions, and then I was free to get on with my life. ‘One thing I have learnt from battling cancer so publicly is how incredibly caring people are. I have also met so many people suffering cancer and all other types of illnesses through Facebook, I have been there for them and they have been there for me.’ She now is busy planning her future with her sons Travis, 7, and Finley, 5. Ms Hedd-Bowen says that she got dressed up every day, even when she was having chemotherapy, and posted a picture of herself in hospital . ‘I have a million plans,’ she said. ‘I am going to raise as much as I can for cancer charities and I plan to start back at college to complete an interior design course. ‘I want to fall in love, I want to travel - everything which life brings. ‘I am so grateful to still be here with my two boys and if anything ever happens to me again, I know I have an army of supporters on Facebook.’ Hodgkin's lymphoma is cancer of the B lymphocytes - a type of white blood cell found in the lymphatic system. Clear fluid called lymph flows through the lymphatic vessels and contains infection-fighting white blood cells known as lymphocytes. In lymphoma, these lymphocytes start to multiply abnormally and begin to collect in certain parts of the lymphatic system, such as the lymph nodes. The most common symptom is a painless swelling in a gland, most commonly in the neck, armpit or groin. The cancer is most common in 15 to 35-year-olds and the over 50s. More men than women are affected. Nearly 1,500 people in the UK are diagnosed with Hodgkin's lymphoma every year. It is one of the most easily treatable forms of cancer - almost all young people with Hodgkin's lymphoma will be cured. For older people, the cure rate is about 80 per cent.

"Saracens are targeting a clean sweep of trophies this season after beginning their LV= Cup campaign with a 25-20 win over Harlequins at Allianz Park, according to assistant boss Joe Shaw. The home side led 15-3 at the interval and appeared to be in complete control only for Quins to improve greatly in the second half and run them close. Quins were totally out of sorts in the first half as elementary errors presented their opponents with two tries and Saracens should have had the game firmly in the bag at the interval. Saracens back Ben Ransom breaks the tackle of Harlequins' Olly Lindsay-Hague as the north London giants beat their west London rivals 25-20 in the LV= Cup . Quins' Jordan Turner-Hall runs hard at Sarries' Maro Itoje and Ernst Joubert in Sunday's spirited loss . Duncan Taylor, Mike Ellery and Jack Wilson scored Saracens' tries with Ben Spencer kicking two penalties and two conversions.

Shaw said: 'Each competition is important to us from the A League up. Obviously you have to put youth in at certain stages but we want to win every game. 'We were in control but had two tries ruled out by the TMO. We tried to force things too much in the final quarter and let them grow into the game. However, Quins had a bit of experience in their line-up and a lot of talent so we are more than happy with the result.' Duncan Taylor crosses for one of Saracens' three tries in the match .

"John Guidetti's ninth goal in seven games proved enough to seal Celtic's fifth consecutive win - but Inverness were left raging that the strike stood. The Swede scored on a 49th-minute counter-attack but Caley Thistle claimed Scott Brown had unfairly won the ball to spark the move. Guidetti soon had a penalty claim rejected before Celtic survived a late onslaught to hang on for a 1-0 win. Celtic's John Guidetti celebrates his goal during the Scottish Premiership match at Celtic Park . Celtic: Zaluska, Lustig (Matthews 63'), Denayer, van Dijk, Izaguirre, Brown, Mulgrew, Wakaso (McGregor 71'), Johansen, Stokes, Guidetti (Griffiths 80'). Subs: Ambrose, Scepovic, Kayal, Fasan. Booked: Wakaso, Mulgrew . Goals: Guidetti 49' Inverness: Brill, Warren, Meekings, Tremarco, Raven, Tansey, Vincent (McKay 70'), Draper (Doran 83'), Shinnie, Watkins, Williams (Christie 70'). Subs (not used): Esson, Ross, Devine, Polworth. Booked: Draper, Tremarco . Referee: Craig Thomson . Caley Thistle created four clear chances in the final eight minutes but some poor finishing cost them and allowed Ronny Deila's men to move up to third spot in the Scottish Premiership. With Craig Gordon rested, Lukasz Zaluska came into the Celtic team for the first time since being injured in an alleged assault in Glasgow last month. The Pole was tested within 90 seconds when midfielder Graeme Shinnie made space to shoot from 25 yards and the goalkeeper held at the second attempt. Inverness manager John Hughes dropped striker Billy McKay to the bench and brought in defender Carl Tremarco, who took Shinnie's normal role at left-back. Marley Watkins played up front for Caley Thistle but he was largely isolated in the opening half as a five-man midfield played close to a back four. Celtic got behind the mass of blue shirts early on when Stefan Johansen cut the ball back for Guidetti but the Swede sent a first-time effort over the bar. Mubarak Wakaso had a shot deflected wide after Shinnie had given the ball away in a dangerous area but Inverness were looking comfortable. Anthony Stokes failed to make the most of two half chances from crosses and Celtic were restricted to long-range efforts in the latter stages of the half. Dean Brill beat away Virgil van Dijk's powerful effort before Stokes and Brown drove not far wide. Shinnie fired over from 22 yards after good play from Danny Wiliams just before the break.

Celtic's Scott Brown (right) goes down trying to get to the ball during the first half . Celtic's Anthony Stokes and Inverness Caledonian Thistle's Garry Warren (right) vie for the ball . The game exploded into life when Brown won the ball midway inside the Inverness half before giving the ball to send Stokes on the charge. Caley Thistle were suddenly exposed and, although Stokes under-hit his pass to Guidetti, the Swede managed to work enough space to fire past two defenders and beat Brill with the power of his strike. However, the visitors were furious with referee Craig Thomson for missing what they claimed was a pull on the shirt of Danny Williams by Brown when he won possession. Watkins was booked for protesting and the controversy continued moments later when Guidetti had two penalty appeals rejected in quick succession. The on-loan Manchester City forward claimed handball when his shot was blocked as several visiting players dived at his feet and then appeared to be bundled over by Tremarco, but a free-kick was given against him after he fell on the ball. Ross Draper was booked for confronting Guidetti after a number of players got involved in the recriminations. Guidetti scores the opener for Celtic in the early stages of the second half . And the forward celebrates his goal in somewhat emphatic fashion on the Celtic Park turf . The visitors had a good chance to level when Shinnie fed Williams but the left-winger fired over from 15 yards. Wakaso and Tremarco received yellow cards for late tackles as the game remained tetchy. It was also far more open with Inverness bringing on Ryan Christie, Aaron Doran and McKay in the hunt for an equaliser and consequently leaving more gaps at the back. Shinnie shot wide with the aid of a deflection from a decent position before van Dijk missed a good chance at the other end. And Inverness put Celtic under intense late pressure. Greg Tansey blazed over from 16 yards after Doran's shot was blocked and Tremarco nodded over after Gary Warren had headed a corner into the six-yard box. Warren set up another opportunity in injury-time but McKay could not get enough on the ball from six yards and Zaluska pounced to smother, before the Pole saved Tremarco's downward header and scrambled the bouncing ball over the bar.","John Guidetti's ninth goal in seven games was enough for Celtic .

"Kris Boyd's third goal in five games handed Rangers a 1-0 win over Dumbarton and a place in the William Hill Scottish Cup fourth round. The Ibrox frontman endured a frustrating start to the season as he failed to score in any of his team's first eight league games. But since breaking his Scottish Championship duck against Raith Rovers a fortnight ago, the former Scotland striker has gradually resdicovered his scoring touch. Rangers striker Kris Boyd scores his third in five games in their Scottish Cup win over Dumbarton . The 31-year-old fired Rangers ahead seconds before the half-time whistle and just moments after another strike had been ruled out for offside. The Premiership record scorer's confidence is still not at maximum levels, however - a fact highlighted by an easy miss right at the start of the second half which would have made life a lot easier for Ally McCoist's side as they had to dig deep to see out the win. Boyd's goal sets up a meeting with Celtic . Having gone 22 years without visiting the town of Dumbarton, Rangers were back beside the Rock for the second time in a week. McCoist's men were comfortable 3-0 victors over the Sons last Saturday as the sides met in the league. But it was the hosts who created the first opening of the third-round tie as Mitch Megginson forced Gers' stand-in keeper Lee Robinson - replacing Steve Simonsen following his midweek collision with a post - into an early finger-tip save. Dumbarton had been happy to have a go at their guests last week but having learned their lesson, boss Ian Murray set up a five-man defensive guard at the back to protect against both the threat from out wide and through the middle. That left Rangers to toil through their usual disjointed motions, with their only attempt in the first half an hour a wild swing from Ian Black which flew both high and wide. Ricky Foster came closer as he drove inside from his right-back slot to shoot but even then it was nowhere near to troubling Dumbarton keeper Jamie Ewings. Rangers lacked tempo, inventiveness and composure. They were just lucky the same could be said of their opponents. But eventually their quality began to shine through. Boyd had the ball in the net four minutes before the break as he re-directed Foster's errant shot but saw it chalked off after wandering offside. Rangers players celebrate what turned out to be the winner from Boyd . Thankfully for the Glasgow giants, the striker's next effort did count. Lewis Macleod's through ball found Boyd 15 yards out and after sorting his feet out, he clipped the ball off the base of the post and into the net. His scoring touch remains fragile, though, and he made a complete mess of his next opening five minutes into the second period. There was nothing spectacular about Nicky Law's long punt but it caught out the Dumbarton defence as Boyd darted through on Ewings. He only had the keeper to beat but put his finish straight at the keeper's legs. Rangers' Stevie Smith (left) and Dumbarton's Colin Nish (right) compete for a head in their tight Cup clash . Macleod then fired into the side netting before seeing another effort saved easily by the keeper. Rangers remained in control but the longer they went without adding to their lead, the more Dumbarton believed they could grab something from the match. The Sons thought their moment had come as Andy Graham got his head onto Scott Linton's long free-kick but Robinson proved again he was an able deputy in goal with another solid save. Garry Fleming went close with a 20-yard strike 10 minutes before time as the away support held its breath. Substitute Jon Daly could have eased their fraying nerves but fired over from 10 yards out as Rangers eventually clung on for victory.","Kris Boyd has three goals in his past five games after scoring on Saturday .

In reference to his omission from the Wales squad last week, the veteran Lions prop tweeted: ‘If I can’t get picked at 3 any more, I think I’ll try to get the number 10 spot!’ While his shot at the posts was off target, Jones was a force in the scrum as the Blues turned the screw on their Irish visitors, only for Paddy Butler’s late try to leave Mark Hammett’s men languishing in ninth place in the table, with just one league win from seven games.

The invitational side were ahead going into the final quarter but a raft of replacements turned the tide for the Wallabies. Tries by Rob Horne and Bernard Foley gave Michael Cheika’s team the edge, despite a late rally by the Barbarians which featured a try and an assist by their Australian wing Nick Cummins.

"Midfielder Adam Lallana insists he never forced an exit from Southampton before moving to Liverpool in the summer. After a hugely impressive season with the Saints in the Premier League last term, Lallana secured a £25million move to Anfield, and joined Rickie Lambert and Dejan Lovren in moving from the south coast to Merseyside. Adam Lallana scored his first goal for Liverpool since his £25million move against West Brom on Saturday . Lallana is now a full England international, seen here in training ahead of the Euro 2016 qualifiers . But the 26-year-old left on bad terms, with suggestions he had threatened not to play for Southampton if they didn't allow him to move. This, Lallana says, is not true. 'I didn't say I'd never play for the club again. That's completely false,' Lallana said. 'Once I knew of Liverpool's interest, I asked the club if they could come to an agreement and that it would be my wish to leave and join Liverpool. I'll make no secret of that.

"Hate preacher Abu Hamza's most trusted lieutenant will be kicked out of Britain to face terror charges in America, it was revealed today. Following a High Court hearing in London judges have given Home Secretary Theresa May the go ahead to extradite mentally-ill Broadmoor patient Haroon Aswat. European judges had ruled last year that the 34-year-old terror suspect, from Dewsbury, West Yorkshire, could not be deported because it would be bad for his mental health. Ruling: Haroon Aswat (right), pictured with radical cleric Abu Hamza al Masri, has been told today he will be extradited from Britain to the United States . Aswat, who claims to be a schizophrenic, is wanted by the U.S. authorities for plotting to set up a jihadi training camp in Bly, Oregon. He said if extradited and convicted he would be at risk of ill-treatment inside the so-called supermax prison ADX Florence, in Colorado. The  prison, which is surrounded by desert, and known as the 'Alcatraz of the Rockies' and is home to 400 of America's most dangerous convicts, where they live in a cramped cell measuring 12ft by 7ft. Hamza and four other terror suspects were extradited two years ago after the European Court of Human Rights rejected their appeal against the move. Hamza, Babar Ahmad, Seyla Talha Ahsan, Adel Abdul Bary and Khaled Al-Fawwaz were all then removed from the country. But Aswat's case was adjourned to allow judges more time to consider his mental health. Mr Justice Mitting, sitting at the High Court with The Lord Chief Justice, Lord Thomas, found there was 'no risk at all' of inhuman treatment in the U.S. Claim: Aswat had claimed up to 50 years without parole in the Supermax jail in Florence, Colorado - the Alcatraz of the Rockies - would breach his human rights . Today, Mr Justice Mitting, sitting at the High Court with The Lord Chief Justice, Lord Thomas, found there was 'no risk at all' of inhuman treatment in the U.S. The pair dismissed Aswat's bid to delay extradition. Aswat, who was born in Batley, West Yorkshire, now faces imminent removal to the USA and a three week trial for terror offences. He was transferred from prison to Broadmoor in 2008 suffering with paranoid schizophrenia. Hamza, who was serving a seven-year sentence in Britain for soliciting to murder and inciting racial hatred when he was extradited, has denied 11 counts of criminal conduct related to the taking of 16 hostages in Yemen in 1998 and advocating violent jihad in Afghanistan in 2001. He is also accused of conspiring to establish the Oregon-based jihad training camp between June 2000 and December 2001. Home Office officials said later that the case could yet be heard by the Supreme Court. They said pending any Supreme Court application by Aswat's lawyers, extradition arrangements would be made. 'We are pleased the court has upheld the Home Secretary's decision to extradite Haroon Aswat to the United States,' said a Home Office spokesman. 'The court agreed that the American authorities had provided sufficient assurances over the conditions in which Aswat would be held in the U.S. 'Aswat's legal team has been given an opportunity to seek leave to appeal to the Supreme Court. Subject to any application, arrangements will now be made for his extradition.'","Home Secretary Theresa May given go ahead to extradite Haroon Aswat .

But the Polish striker insists Dortmund, who are currently in the relegation zone after losing five of their previous six Bundesliga games, will catch up with their rivals. Robert Lewandowski shakes hands with his former manager Jurgen Klopp after Bayern Munich's win . Lewandowski points to the sky after scoring against his old club, but says it wasn't a celebration . Dortmund are struggling in the Bundesliga this season, but Lewandowski has backed them to turn it around . 'I know BVB are still a great team,' said Lewandowski after the game. 'They're struggling at the moment. 'But I expect them to come catch up again and I know they will play in the Champions League again next season.' Lewandowski's goal, which cancelled out Marco Reus' first-half header, was his first against Dortmund since joining German champions Bayern this summer. Despite the tough start, Lewandowski thinks his former club will make next season's Champions League . Arjen Robben's penalty inflicted a fifth defeat in six league games on Klopp's relegation-threatened side . Marco Reus had given the visitors the lead in the first half with this excellent header . And while the striker pointed to the sky after finding the net he insisted it was not a celebration against his former employers. 'It was not an easy game - for me, either,' he said. 'I did not celebrate  but it was an important goal and it was a goal for my dad. 'We were not perfect during the first half but the only important thing is that we got the three points.'","Borussia Dortmund have lost five of their last six league games .

"Sunderland striker Connor Wickham is considering a move abroad to try and recapture the 'Golden Boy tag' that saw him tipped at one time to become the best English striker since Wayne Rooney. Wickham, still only 21, was watched by every big club in the Premier League including Manchester United and Chelsea as a teenager at Ipswich before joining Sunderland at 18 in a deal that could have reached £8million. But the England Under-21 striker has scored only 10 goals in 60 games in three seasons for the BlackCats and spent time on loan to Sheffield Wednesday. Sunderland striker Connor Wickham is contemplating a move broad when his contract expires . The 21-year-old has scored just 10 goals, including this one against Manchester City, in 60 appearances . With his contract due to expire in the summer, the strapping 6ft4ins centre-forward is able to negotiate with foreign clubs in the New Year and it's an opportunity he plans to take. Despite his youth, Wickham does not feel it is too early to sample life overseas and follow the example of Ashley Cole and Gareth Bale who are enjoying their time in Europe. Sunderland manager Gus Poyet would like to persuade the striker to stay after he played a key role in helping them avoid relegation last season. He said earlier this season: 'Connor is a player he wants to keep, a massive part of our miracle Great Escape last season and he is a very important part to our plans.' Wickham was part of the Sunderland team humiliated 8-0 in their last away game at Southampton a fortnight ago and a repeat performance at Crystal Palace on Monday night could lead to Poyet's departure. Wickham was considered one of the hottest properties in England but has struggled to assert himself . The England Under-21 striker can talk to foreign clubs in January and could sign a pre-contract .","Sunderland signed Connor Wickham from Ipswich in a deal worth up to £8m .

"AC Milan missed the chance to go third in the Serie A table after suffering a 2-0 home defeat to Palermo on Sunday evening. The Rossoneri would have dislodged Sampdoria from the final Champions League place with three points at San Siro, but an early own goal from Christian Zapata set the tone for an under-par display. Paulo Dybala scored the Sicilians' second goal, one that both assured promoted Palermo of a first away win of the season and lifted them six points clear of the relegation zone and into 13th place. Cristian Zapata heads the ball into his own net as AC Milan go 1-0 down after 23  minutes . AC Milan goalkeeper Diego Lopez makes a fantastic save during the game at the San Siro . Sampdoria had earlier returned to the title race by edging out Fiorentina 3-1 in a frenetic clash at the Stadio Luigi Ferraris. The opening 45 minutes witnessed three goals and a saved penalty as Samp battled to wrestle third place from Napoli, while Fiorentina appeared determined to escape from mid-table obscurity. Angelo Palombo notched first for the hosts, from the spot, minutes before Fiorentina midfielder Gonzalo Rodriguez saw his penalty snaffled by Sergio Romero. Milan striker Fernando Torres (left) battles for possession with Palermo's Sinisa Andelkovic . Paulo Dybala celebrates with the Palermo bench after firing his side 2-0 in front in the first half . Luca Rizzo and Stefan Savic then exchanged goals just before the break, with Eder rubber-stamping the Blucerchiati's first league win in four attempts with a 78th-minute strike. Genoa won a third straight game on Sunday with a 4-2 triumph at Udinese. Each team scored twice in the opening half, but Alessandro Matri put the visitors in front for good in the 54th minute. Udinese wasted several chances to equalise before substitute Juraj Kucka killed the game off three minutes from time with Genoa's fourth goal. Torino fans will have to wait longer for their team to win two league games in a row as they were held to a goalless draw by Atalanta. The Granata could have sealed all three points deep in stoppage time, but substitute midfielder Alexander Farnerud saw Atalanta goalkeeper Marco Sportiello deflect his shot over the crossbar. Chievo halted a four-match losing streak with a stalemate at home to Sassuolo. The visitors were the better side, but could not find a way past Chievo goalkeeper Albano Bizarri, who made three saves to earn his team a valuable point.","Cristian Zapata own-goal and Paulo Dybala strike secure win .

"Gus Poyet will need to crack the curse of Sunderland’s Monday malaise if they are to emerge from the relegation zone at Crystal Palace. The Black Cats have not won in 20 attempts on a Monday in the Premier League, a wretched run stretching back to April Fools’ Day, 2002. Poyet is the ninth permanent boss who has failed to reverse the trend. He lost at home to West Ham and at Spurs last season and now takes on another London opponent in desperate need of victory.

SUNDERLAND XI (4-1-4-1): Pantilimon; Reveillere, Vergini, O’Shea, Van Aanholt; Cattermole; Buckley, Rodwell, Larsson; Johnson; Fletcher. ‘It’s not a nice record. It’s difficult to accept,’ said the Uruguayan. ‘It’s not normal because probably in those 20 games we’ve played home and away, and against top teams and small teams. ‘Maybe the players don’t like to play on a Monday night. Maybe we should ask the FA to let us play at another time. Maybe Friday! ‘But it’s a terrible stat and it doesn’t lie. I suppose it’s a great chance to finish it. Let’s see if we can do it.’ Poyet's side have failed to win a Monday night game since April 2002 - a run spanning nine permanent bosses . Poyet and his team face trial by television at Selhurst Park as they look to recover from back-to-back defeats which have plunged them in to the bottom three. The boss, though, insists he is not concerned by a national audience. ‘I like the telly, that’s where everybody can see you. You need to perform,’ he said. ‘I prefer to take a risk and show everybody what we can do on TV. That way everybody can see how we respond after the 8-0 hammering against Southampton.’ Steven Fletcher in action during Sunderland's previous match - a 0-2 loss against Arsenal . Poyet was in charge of Brighton when they met Palace in the Championship play-off semi-finals in 2013. The Eagles eventually won promotion to the Premier League but Poyet left Brighton that summer amid the lingering row over excrement smeared in Palace’s dressing-room at the AMEX Stadium. And Poyet, who was furious about the incident, said: ‘I can’t explain it, no. It would be nice if one day someone could explain it to all of us because we still don’t know what happened. Seriously. Nothing.’ He added: ‘I’ll probably get a hostile reception. I like that as well. When nobody cares about you, that’s when you feel rubbish.’ Poyet, meanwhile, will include Steven Fletcher after the striker trained over the weekend. There had been fears the two-goal top scorer had broken a metatarsal during the 2-0 defeat to Arsenal but he is fit and will lead the line.

"Everton made almost twice as many passes as Swansea City during the 0-0 draw at Goodison Park - 605 to 304. Jonjo Shelvey should spend the next three weeks thinking about how he can improve his discipline, according to Swansea manager Garry Monk. Shelvey, signed by Liverpool at 18, was sent off in Swansea’s goalless draw at Everton and already has 22 yellow cards and two reds at the age of 22. The midfielder will not be able to play for Swansea until their game at Manchester City on November 22 because the club’s next match against Arsenal, for which he is suspended, is followed by an international break. Swansea City's Jonjo Shelvey trudges disconsolately off of the Goodison Park pitch after being sent off . Shelvey's 'commitment is not in question but his judgement is ' according to Swansea boss Garry Monk (right) The former Liverpool midfielder was booed off the pitch by Everton fans after he was shown a second yellow . Everton (4-2-3-1): Howard 6; Coleman 6.5, Alcaraz 5 (Besic 32min, 6), Jagielka 6, Baines 6; Barry 6.5, McCarthy 7.5; McGeady 7 (Lukaku 68, 6), Naismith 6 (Pienaar 68, 5.5), Barkley 6; Eto’o 5.5. Subs not used: Robles, Hibbert, Atsu, Osman. Booked: Barry, Besic.

Subs not used: Tremmel, Gomis, Bartley, Shephard. Booked: Bony, Williams, Sigurdsson. Sent off: Shelvey. Man of the match: James McCarthy. Referee: Kevin Friend 6. His first caution was for kicking the ball away to waste time, his second was for wrestling James McCarthy as the Everton player surged towards the penalty area. ‘His commitment isn’t in question but sometimes his judgment is,’ said Monk. ‘You have to be clever - you play with intensity but a cool head. It’s the first one, the sloppy ones, we can cut out.’ Monk had substituted the booked Wilfried Bony to prevent him being sent off and was thinking about doing the same for Shelvey when his 72nd-minute indiscretion saw him ordered off. ‘He has to learn very quickly,’ added the manager. ‘He’s got a few weeks to think about it.’ When Antolin Alcaraz went off with a shoulder injury after half an hour, Gareth Barry, 33, moved to centre half for the first time since he was a youngster at Aston Villa. ‘He represents everything we are at Everton,’ said boss Roberto Martinez. Early signs suggest Alcaraz may be out for months, which could mean a return for Sylvain Distin, 36, who was not even on the bench.

"Ally McCoist has taken a cheeky swipe back at John Guidetti after the Celtic striker voiced confidence of sinking Rangers in a potential League Cup showdown. Anticipation over a first Old Firm meeting since 2012 has been heightened after both clubs made it through to the semi-final draw, which will take place this evening. Speaking after netting a hat-trick in a 6-0 rout of 10-man Partick Thistle on Wednesday night, Guidetti insisted he would relish facing Rangers and warned that Celtic’s last four opponents were ‘going down’. Ally McCoist has taken  a cheeky swipe at Celtic's John Guidetti after he voiced confidence of sinking Rangers . That exuberant assessment by the Manchester City loanee drew a smiling response from McCoist. ‘With the greatest of respect to John, I remember getting excited about my first hat-trick - but against 11 men,’ said the Ibrox boss. ‘Listen, he’s entitled to his opinion and that’s the way it is. ‘But maybe, just maybe, he’s got caught up in the excitement of scoring his first hat-trick for Celtic - which, of course, we congratulate him on.’ Swedish striker John Guidetti is on a season-loan at Celtic from Premier League champions Manchester City . The 22-year-old scored a hat-trick against Partick Thistle in the League Cup, taking his tally to eight for the club . Parkhead manager Ronny Deila has also stated that the ‘best teams are in the top division’, implying that he sees Aberdeen and Dundee United as greater semi-final dangers than Rangers. ‘In normal circumstances he would be right,’ said McCoist. ‘But in the last few years nothing has been what it seems in Scottish football. We’ve had anything but normal circumstances. ‘You have three of the five biggest clubs in the country playing in the Championship. ‘That would tell us it’s not normal circumstances. If it were normal then, yes, the three teams in the top-flight would be stronger than the team from the division below. ‘I understand Ronny but I don’t necessarily agree with him.’ McCoist admitted after Tuesday night’s win over St Johnstone that he would rather steer clear of Celtic but is adamant that does not mean he would fear a derby meeting. Ronny Deila is confident Guidetti can be persuaded to stay at the club, even if they can't offer huge wages . ‘I need to explain myself because there have been one or two things written and said,’ he continued. ‘I am certainly not running scared or hiding behind the couch. ‘I thought it was common sense what I was trying to say and I stand by that. As everyone can see from the bookies, Celtic are 4/5 favourites, everybody else is 9/2. ‘Because the bookies are very rarely wrong I thought it was common sense that you’d like a shot at one of the teams at 9/2 in terms of enhancing your chances of making the final. ‘There is no “I want to avoid Celtic at all costs”. That couldn’t be further from the truth.’ Rangers are set to be without Steve Simonsen and Fraser Aird for today’s Scottish Cup third-round tie at Dumbarton. Simonsen suffered a head injury in midweek, while Aird is sidelined by a strained abductor muscle.","Ally McCoist's Rangers could face Celtic in the League Cup .

"James Milner is ready to shoulder extra responsibility at Manchester City with David Silva ruled out of the Manchester derby. Milner, arguably City’s best player this season, may be asked by manager Manuel Pellegrini to play in a more central role with City missing Silva’s creativity against United at the Etihad Stadium. The 28-year-old has played in nearly every outfield position during his career and would not be daunted by switching from wide to the centre if Pellegrini opts for one up front. James Milner may be given a central role in the Manchester derby after David Silva was ruled out . Milner said: ‘It doesn’t bother me where I play — I just want to be in the team. But I think my best position is in the middle and if the manager thinks I can do a job there against United then I’ll be ready. ‘I don’t know what his thoughts are but I was bought as a central midfielder and I’ve had a bit more time in there this season, though mainly I have been used wide. ‘I’d rather be in a team with David Silva than without him. He will be a massive loss for us because he is such a great player, . ‘But we have got a strong squad. When one top player drops out, another one comes straight in.’ David Silva will miss the Manchester derby after suffering knee injury in cup defeat by Newcastle . Milner would have left in the summer had Pellegrini let him but he’s been a regular for club and country this season and is now open to the idea of signing a new contract before his current one expires in the summer. ‘I’d love to stay at City. That’s the bottom line,’ he revealed. ‘This is a club that is winning things, we have great players and the fans have always been great. ‘It’s a no-brainer for me, I would love to sign a new contract. We are talking, but there hasn’t been an actual contract offer yet. ‘Obviously I’d like things to be sorted sooner rather than later, but I’m not putting a timescale on it. At the moment, all I am thinking about is keeping my place in the team. ‘You don’t expect to play every game when you’re at a club like this, but I wanted more opportunities and the manager has given them to me. As one of the senior voices in the dressing-room, Milner doesn’t hide that this has been an inconsistent start to the season for City. Manchester City striker Sergio Aguero takes part in training on Saturday . They have already lost four times in all competitions and trail Chelsea in the League. ‘We know we’ve let our standards slip in the last couple of weeks but it hasn’t been because of a lack of effort,’ he said. ‘We have spoken about it as a group. We’re quite harsh in the way we criticise ourselves. We don’t hide behind excuses. ‘There is such a long way to go and we certainly don’t feel that anything has been won or lost yet in terms of the Premier League. ‘This is a big game for us — but it’s a big game for United as well — and it’s true what they say that sometimes form counts for nothing. If you can’t get yourself up for a Manchester derby then you’re in trouble.’ Manchester City midfielder Yaya Toure wears a snood to keep warm during training on Saturday .","James Milner may be asked to play in a more central role in derby .

"He will be at home when the awards are handed out rather than standing on stage, holding a memento that recognises his supreme efforts. Cast a glance at the Ballon d’Or nominees and, in a flash, you will see that one big name is notable by its absence. While Paul Pogba, the Juventus and France midfielder, and the mercurial Zlatan Ibrahimovic make the 23-man list ahead, Luis Suarez misses the cut. No matter that Suarez scored 31 goals in the Barclays Premier League, was crowned both the PFA and Football Writers’ Player of the Year, and came within a whisker of leading Liverpool to the title, when the prizes are distributed next January, Suarez will be nowhere to be seen. Luis Suarez beams as he poses with the 2014 PFA player of the year award back in April . We all know why. The World Cup, Uruguay versus Italy in Natal; as his dream is slipping away, the fuses in his mind short-circuit and he bites Giorgio Chiellini. The incident becomes front page news around the globe and a four-month ban follows. Forget that bite on Branislav Ivanovic - after which he was still named in the shortlist for 2013 award. This was on a much bigger stage. From that point of view, Suarez must take his medicine. When you bring the game into disrepute in such extraordinary circumstances, you have to expect the backlash and punishments that follow. Suarez, in this respect, is his own worst enemy. Suarez's year took a significant turn for the worse when he opted to bite Giorgio Chiellini in July . But, for all that, you cannot help feel the 23-man list to be crowned the best footballer on the planet lacks sheen without his presence. It is sad, in some respects, because Suarez’s talents are so magnificent that he easily rubs shoulders with those who are in the running. This is not to say he would have won the Ballon d’Or. Bookmakers rightly have Cristiano Ronaldo as the long odds-on favourite, having helped Real Madrid win the Champions League and Copa del Rey with more goals than you could imagine possible. He is a phenomenon. If he had not bitten Chiellini, though, Suarez should have made the podium. He was glorious to watch last season, a force of nature with dynamite in boots, someone who could not have done any more to lift Liverpool over a line they had not crossed for 24 years. Suarez's form for Liverpool last season earned him a £75million move to Barcelona . ‘Rehabilitation is something we respect in this country,’ Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers said on the night the FWA honoured Suarez. ‘He had a difficult time but once the power of Liverpool convinced him to stay and he concentrated on his football, he was incredible.’ That last word was not used lightly nor was it hyperbole. A ticket to Anfield last season guaranteed entertainment and supporters went with the giddy anticipation of wondering what Suarez was going to produce for his next trick. How about four goals, including a 35-yard volley, against Norwich? What about the strike against Cardiff before Christmas that had the trajectory of a boomerang? Or the dispossessing of Phil Jagielka and subsequent 60-yard sprint that ended with Liverpool’s final goal in the 4-0 win over Everton? Suarez celebrates one of his four goals scored against Norwich at Anfield in December 2013 . The Uruguayan celebrates wildly after scoring against Everton in January as Liverpool won 4-0 . There were hat-tricks at home, hat-tricks on the road and, in some ways, one of his most spectacular moments was one that failed to end up with a goal – think of the volley from Steven Gerrard’s corner against Arsenal that smashed against the crossbar from 30 yards. ‘From day one he was a phenomenal in training every day and in the games,’ Gerrard reflected. ‘He would have been deadly for us in the Champions League. There’s no getting away from that. Everyone knows what I think of him. He’ll cause mayhem in the Champions League with Barcelona.’ Suarez had some highlights reel. Cast your eye over the Ballon d’Or list again and, though there is no arguing about the quality of those selected, a number of players did not reach the levels the man from Salto scaled during Liverpool’s bid for glory. A tearful Cristiano Ronaldo picks up last year's award in Zurich - he is odds-on favourite to win it again . Without that bite, he would, quite probably, have been standing shoulder-to-shoulder with Ronaldo and, in all likelihood, Lionel Messi or Diego Costa, the totem at the head of Atletico Madrid’s charge to La Liga and the Champions League final. Instead, when football’s gliteratti assemble in Zurich next January, he will be in the shadows. He will know it should have so been different.","Luis Suarez named PFA and FWA player of the year last season in England .

"Andy Murray's surge of form has seen him reach London's season-end finale – but it also means that mum Judy may have to survive several more weeks in Strictly Come Dancing for her son to watch her in person. Family loyalties aside, there was no doubt that he would trade the former for the latter, after he elegantly swept aside Grigor Dimitrov on Thursday to confirm his place in next month's eight-man field in the Barclays ATP World Finals. His commitments at the O2 Arena, plus the minimum of a late quarter final on Saturday at the Paris Masters, mean that he will almost certainly miss out on the filial duty of watching Britain's Fed Cup captain on the dancefloor for at least the next two Saturdays. Andy Murray celebrates having finally booked his place in London for the ATP World Tour Finals . It is a price he is more than willing to pay for the deep satisfaction of having convincingly hauled himself into the elite London event from a position of twelfth two months ago.

'There's a possibility I could go if I'm back but if it's on a Saturday I could be playing the next day. 'It's been a long six weeks so I'm quite looking forward to getting back and being in my own bed and my home for quite a few days, rather than watching some very average dancing.' Before speaking fondly of his mother's efforts to master things like the Charleston, Murray reflected on the jolt that he received after losing in the US Open quarter finals and finding himself out of the top 10 for the first time since 2008, and how it fired him. The Scot beat world No 11 Grigor Dimitrov 6-3, 6-3 in the third-round of the Paris Masters . Andy Murray's mum Judy and dancer Anton Du Beke perform in Strictly Come Dancing . After so impressively dismissing Dimitrov he wrote 'Bad Year' under his signature on the lens of the courtside camera, a riposte to those who have underestimated him in 2014. It would be hard to find any sensible observer who has described him as having had a 'bad' year (just as it would be difficult to unearth anyone sensible who 'wrote off' Roger Federer after 2012) but until late September it was assuredly a difficult season by Murray's high standards. He has responded admirably, and matters could improve further if he were to beat either Novak Djokovic in Friday's match. 'When I dropped out of the top ten that kind of hit me a little bit,' he said. 'I thought I needed to get back to winning tournaments, I shouldn't be having a top four player in the world schedule right now if I want to get back up to the top. It was time to start winning again, get my head down and start to win the less glamorous events. Murray's impressive run continues in Paris, he'll either face Novak Djokovic on Friday . Dimitrov, who beat Murray at Wimbledon, ended his challenge for the World Tour Finals after losing to Murray . 'There's been a lot of 'are the top four being broken up?' 'am I still part of that conversation?'. Next year I hope I can go a bit further in the Slams, I was consistent in the Slams (he reached the quarters or better) but didn't do as well as I would have liked there, but those guys above me are great players. 'Writing 'bad year' wasn't a jibe, it was a bit of fun. It's been a hard year, a tough year, but not a bad year. I've had to dig deep at the end of it to salvage it, if you like. Coming back from surgery (on his back twelve months ago) in an individual sport is not easy. I would have signed up to be in this position twelve months ago.' It was his 58th win of 2014, with some of the most fluent tennis he can produce in making Dimitrov, the man who upset him at Wimbledon, look very ordinary. The world No 8 signed the courtside camera 'Bad Year!' after the match, sarcastically mocking his critics . The two-time Grand Slam champion answered critics of his form by writing this message on the camera . His ease of movement –always an indicator of his form - was slightly superior to that which has been seen from his mother on the dancefloor, although it is easy to see where he gets his powers of application from, judging by her improvement. 'She's loved doing it,' he said of Judy. ' I think what she's found quite hard is the performing. I think she's concentrating so hard on doing the dance correctly and moving her feet in the right way and not forgetting stuff that she maybe doesn't show that she's enjoying it that much. 'But from what she's said to me it's been the best fun she's had in such a long time, learning something new. Her partner (Anton Du Beke) has been loads of fun. But for her it's tough on the body. She's doing six hours of dancing three days a week to get ready and then they do the show. 'Being in heels and stuff, she doesn't normally wear them, she's normally in trainers. So for her it's quite tough physically which I don't think she was really expecting. I've only seen two of the dances but she's having a good time, that's the most important thing. Maybe if I was playing on the Monday at the O2 there's a possibility I could go.'

"Novak Djokovic landed a major blow in the battle with Roger Federer to end the year at the top of the world rankings as the Serbian claimed his 20th Masters title in Paris on Sunday. Djokovic ended his week in the French capital without losing a set as he cruised to a 6-2, 6-3 victory against big-serving Canadian Milos Raonic, with the 27-year-old notching up his 600th career win in the process. It was a telling sign 12 days ago of how desperate Djokovic is to retain his position as world No 1 that he took to the practice court less than 24 hours after the birth of his first child, Stefan.

Runner up Milos Raonic (left) and Djokovic pose with former Chelsea man Luiz at the presentation . Djokovic's victory now gives him a commanding lead of 1,310 ranking points over Federer and three wins at the ATP World Tour Finals in London, which begin this Sunday, will be enough to guarantee that he finishes the season in top spot. Raonic served an early reminder of his raw power in Sunday’s final with a 138mph ace from his first serve of the match but Djokovic, the best returner in the sport, still managed to break before holding off a fightback from the Canadian to wrap up the first set. Djokovic quickly moved a break up in the second set as Raonic served a double fault on break point down and Djokovic took full advantage as he eased to victory in one hour and 23 minutes before being presented with the trophy by PSG and former Chelsea star David Luiz. Djokovic's tournament victory gives him a commanding lead of 1,310 ranking points over Federer . Just three wins at the ATP World Tour Finals in London will assure Djokovic of the No 1 place at the end of 2014 . Roger Federer is the closest threat to Djokovic in the race for the top ranking at Christmas . Federer fell to Raonic in the semi-final of the Paris Masters but has a chance to regain the No 1 spot in London . All eyes now turn to London ahead of the season-ending showpiece at the O2 Arena, where the rest of the field will no doubt hope to avoid landing in the same group as Djokovic, who is unbeaten in 27 indoor matches, when the draw is made on Monday afternoon. Andy Murray will be seeded fifth and could potentially be drawn in a group alongside Wimbledon champion Djokovic, Australian Open champion Stan Wawrinka and US Open champion Marin Cilic. After a run of 23 matches in 37 days across Asia and Europe, Murray will be glad of the week of rest in between Paris and London, which has been reintroduced this year after the two events were held back-to-back in 2012 and 2013. On the same day that the names for the eight-man field are pulled out of the hat in London, notable absentee Rafael Nadal will go under the knife in Spain as he undergoes appendix surgery. As well as forcing him out of the ATP World Tour Finals, Nadal has understandably also pulled out of a sponsor's poker match with Brazilian football legend Ronaldo which was due to be held in London on Thursday.","Novak Djokovic beat Milos Raonic 6-2, 6-3 in the Paris Masters final .

"Amelie Mauresmo watched as Andy Murray edged himself towards a place in London's season-end finale, her face almost as inscrutable as that of her predecessor Ivan Lendl. Mauresmo takes a much more consensual approach than Lendl, and is delighted with the recent results which now see her client just one match away from ending any arguments about making the Barclays ATP World Tour finals next month. After a comfortable 6-3 6-4 win over her compatriot Julien Benneteau in the Paris Masters his entry can be confirmed if he beats Grigor Dimitrov. Andy Murray acknowledges spectators after beating Julien Benneteau in the Paris Masters . Murray's coach Amelie Mauresmo (front right) watched on as Murray defeated her compatriot . Mauresmo will regard qualification as a satisfactory conclusion to the first five months of their groundbreaking coaching arrangement, although she acknowledges it will up the ante for next season. As she made clear, she is certainly different to the my-way-or-the-highway style of Lendl when it comes to coaching, suggesting that Murray is more in the driving seat than he was under Lendl. 'It's a manager's role without being a dictator, you are just there to be a guide,' she told L'Equipe newspaper. 'The driving force is the player. It's the player who drives the whole team with their obsession, their concern for each detail and their strong goals. 'The champions always question things. The demand is constant so you look around trying to find solutions and ways to adapt. It's the challenge that is interesting to me. If you have a beautiful adventure together it's great. If for any reason he wants to change or stop it's not a problem. 'Maybe when we arrive in Australia there will be more pressure. In the 2015 Grand Slams there will be more expectation. At present he is in a rising phase, at these moments you don't feel the pressure so much. What counts is not what people or the media says, the most important thing for me is the project. I'm not thinking ""If he doesn't win I will be questioned"".' VIDEO Hard work paying off for Murray . Mauresmo, pictured watching Murray in a practice session, is hoping the Scotsman can really kick on in 2015 . Murray and Ivan Lendl (right) went their separate ways in March 2014 when they ended their partnership . The sometimes seen erratic on-court behaviour of Murray since the authoritative Lendl departed was absent as he dismissed Benneteau in 72 minutes, making light of the draining schedule which is now seeing him play six consecutive weeks. Mark Petchey (2005–2006) Brad Gilbert (2006–2007) Miles MacLagan (2007–2010) Alex Corretja (2010–2011) Ivan Lendl (2011–2014) In 35 days there have been 19 victories, and the Scot has actually won more matches this year – 57 – than any other player bar Roger Federer. No wonder morale is high around the camp, but the real test for the Murray-Mauresmo partnership is likely to come next season. It is the kind of dominant form that was proving so elusive for the British No 1 around the time that Dimitrov provided the most crushing disappointment of the season, the Wimbledon quarter-final defeat when he appeared to be tormented. Amid SW19 mania there was much speculation about some he was supposed to have shouted at his box about something happening 'five minutes' before the match, although more reliable sources said it was '45 minutes'. It was an unusual episode for Murray on the Centre Court – where he is usually so controlled, and hence the brouhaha – but more common at other less visible events. 'The stuff that I say on the court, anyone that knows anything about how my brain works would know it doesn't really actually mean much,' he said. 'It was complete nonsense. It had no bearing on the outcome of the match at all. It was turned into something that was supposedly that I was having big problems with my team or with Amelie or with Danny (Vallverdu) or whatever. But it was completely not the case.'","Amelie Mauresmo is delighted with Andy Murray's recent results .

"Andy Murray recorded yet another victory on Wednesday afternoon – but it was still not enough to guarantee him a place at the season-ending finale at the O2 Arena next month. The former Wimbledon champion overcame world No 25 Julien Benneteau 6-3, 6-4 in convincing fashion to advance to the last 16 of the Paris Masters. But with Canada’s Milos Raonic squeezing through a third-set tie-break to stay alive earlier in the day, and Spaniard David Ferrer also notching an early win, he was still having to wait for confirmation that he will make the eight-man field for the Barclays ATP World Tour Finals. Andy Murray booked his place in the third round of the Paris Masters with a comfortable victory on Wednesday . Murray plays a backhand on his way to a straight-sets victory in the second round of the Paris Masters . He can, however, put an end to all the infernal mathematics if he progresses further on Thursday against Grigor Dimitrov. It remains possible that he could technically book his place in London by the end of Wednesday were Kei Nishikori to lose to Tommy Robredo. In Wednesday's 72-minute advance there were no signs of any physical hangover from his epic win in the Valencia Open on Sunday night, despite this being a sixth consecutive week of tournament play. In the completely dilapidated Bercy stadium – currently undergoing a major facelift and not before time - Murray wasted no time in getting ahead, with plenty of assistance from his opponent.

A general view of the Palais Omnisports de Bercy as Murray (right) takes on Benneteau on Wednesday . Benneteau, who has been playing some of the best tennis of his career at 33, double faulted three consecutive times to hand the 27-year-old Scot a 2-0 lead. Murray’s serve, always an indicator of his confidence levels, was in fine working order and he easily protected that to win the first set. Playing for the first time in front of coach Amelie Mauresmo in her own country, in the second he also went quickly up and then consolidated it without problems. The only glitch came when he was broken back at 4-1 up, but the cushion of two breaks by then was enough for him to withstand the late improvement of the French veteran.

"A remarkable six weeks in the life of Andy Murray started with a controversial tweet, has contained a sustained surge in form and is set to end with qualification for London's season-end finale next month. His opening match in the Paris Masters, versus Frenchman Julien Benneteau on Wednesday, will come 41 days after he more than hinted at his support for Scottish independence - and in the intervening time he has won eighteen matches and three ATP titles. The inevitable reaction to his last gasp, ultimately futile intervention in the referendum debate is clearly not something he wants to dwell on. While he doubts the whole episode sparked something inside of him – winning is always the best way to regain whatever lost popularity - he admits that is one conclusion to draw. Andy Murray sprays celebratory champagne after his victory in the Valencia Open final . The win in Spain was the third tournament victory for Murray in less than six weeks . 'I don't know, I personally haven't looked at it like that, but results could suggest that,' said Murray on Tuesday, contemplating his swift rise to become the year's fifth best player to date. He admitted that the first tournament of this run, at Shenzen in China, was particularly difficult as he successfully strove to win a first title since Wimbledon 2013 after leaving a storm behind at home. Yet the main reasons for his late season improvement lie more prosaically in increased faith in his body and confidence from winning. 'It (Shenzen) was a tough week for a number of reasons,' he said. 'But I knew that after the US Open I needed to start winning again and that's why I said I wanted to start playing tournaments, whether smaller or not. 'If I wasn't beating guys that were inside the top 20 in the world I didn't care, I just wanted to win. Then I started beating top-level opposition, which I wasn't early in the year. Murray speaks to the media on Tuesday ahead of his first appearance at the BNP Paribas Masters . He says the wins in Shenzhen, Vienna and Valencia have been tough but built confidence . Murray says confidence has come from 'winning a lot of tough, long, close matches, especially the finals' 'It's been a long six weeks, but it's been very beneficial for me. I gained a lot of confidence in my body again from playing this much, and then also from winning a lot of tough, long, close matches, especially the three finals.' He explained his comments at Flushing Meadows, where he had sounded indifferent about qualifying for the Barclays ATP World Tour Finals at the O2 Arena. 'I wasn't thinking much at the Open, I was just more interested in trying to get myself back into the top eight players in the world, because for the seedings at the major events at the beginning of next year it makes a big difference.' The price has been paid in physical pain and the accumulation of miles around China and Europe. The most severe reaction followed his epic win in Sunday's Valencia Open final against Tommy Robredo. Murray and Tommy Robredo embrace after an epic final at the ATP 500 World Tour Valencia Open final . Robredo give Murray the double bird in jest after blowing five match points in the final in Valencia, just like he did when the Scot got the better of him in the Shenzhen tournament decider . 'My whole body was sore, my back, my hips just aching, and I was cramping too in the final so the muscles hurt. Ice baths make a huge difference, my body feels different once I've been in one, after the ceremony on Sunday night we got in the ice bath back at the hotel before flying here, and the aches and pains sort of calmed down. 'I've been feeling really bad in the evenings but waking up in the mornings feeling pretty good. My body is clearly getting used to playing matches and recovering well, which at the beginning of the year wasn't the case. In my first event in January I was in bits after playing for an hour.' How his system reacts against Benneteau is hard to predict, but the points on offer would be useful for achieving the feasible goal of finishing this year ranked No 4. As far as London qualification is concerned, all the mathematics this week are on his side.","Andy Murray has won 18 matches and three tournaments in six weeks .

"Fatherhood appears to have done little to slow world number one Novak Djokovic as he got off to a winning start at the BNP Paribas Masters in Paris on Tuesday.

It's different, obviously,' Djokovic told Sky Sports. 'I'm trying to take as much positive energy as I can from what's happened in the past few weeks.

The British No 1 only needs to win two matches in Paris and reach the quarter-finals to mathematically guarantee qualification.

Roger Federer can return to the top of the world rankings for the first time in two years if he wins the title and Novak Djokovic fails to reach the final.

"Kyle Edmund, Britain’s most highly rated young tennis talent, has dispensed with Greg Rusedski as his head coach after less than six months following a recent slump in form. The 19 year-old from Yorkshire, who is currently in Australia, has ended the high profile arrangement and is said to have opted for now to concentrate on working with his other coach, James Trotman. Edmund has lost five consecutive first rounds and is believed to have concluded that Rusedski’s other commitments will prevent him from putting in the necessary time at this key stage of his development. Promising teenager Kyle Edmund has split from coach Greg Rusedski (L) after a slump in form . Edmund has slumped to five consecutive first round defeats in a row this year . The split is something of an embarrassment to Lawn Tennis Association Chief Executive Michael Downey and an early blow to recently appointed Player Development Director Bob Brett, both of who were enthusiastic promoters of Rusedski’s role with the former outstanding junior. More profoundly, it is yet another example of how the centralised LTA system, with its inevitable political complications and vested interests, so often seems to hinder rather than help the production of elite players in Britain. Edmund has looked the brightest prospect of a highly promising cluster of British juniors who a few years ago looked to have a good future, only to hit problems when trying to make the senior ranks with a depressing predictability. Former U.S Open junior champion Oliver Golding, who got through a bewildering number of coaches from the LTA and elsewhere, is currently on an indefinite career break and may not return, while ex Orange Bowl winner George Morgan largely restricts himself to doubles. Former British No 1 Rusedski is believed to have too many other commitments on his plate . Edmund is the latest in a line of British juniors struggling to make the step up to the seniors . Liam Broady, one time junior Wimbledon finalist, endured a major struggle for two years, although he has bounced back impressively this summer is now doing the best of them, currently ranked 235 in the world and the British No 4. He is seven places above Edmund, whose past form had him projected to have advanced to around 150 at this point but has slipped behind the best of his international contemporaries. In April, Downey enthusiastically declared that Rusedski had asked to be ‘given the keys’ to take Edmund on, after the player split from his long standing coach Colin Beecher, under who he had been making solid enough upward progress. British youngster Liam Broady has started to find his form again after struggling for two years . Both Downey and Brett wanted the ex-British No 1 to have a more focussed role in his part-time contract with the governing body, despite being warned that prized youngsters require full-time dedicated coaches. Andy Murray is known to have been among those deeply sceptical about the move. From the outset there were issues about the restraints on Rusedski’s time and, in fairness, the former world No 4 never claimed he would be able to devote himself full-time to the youngster from Beverley, due to such things as his broadcasting and corporate commitments. Beecher has now left the LTA, ironically one of the few coaches to depart amid a general wave of redundancies that has been taking place there. British No 1 Andy Murray (L) was sceptical about the move to bring in Rusedski on a part time basis . Edmund’s stalled progress again suggests that, after its serial failures of recent decades, the governing body should distance itself as much as possible from the whole area of performance and outsource the process as much as possible to independent programmes at home and abroad. As a talented player with an impressively mature outlook and work ethic, Edmund is comfortably young enough to kick on again and resume his climb up the rankings to fulfil the exciting promise he has shown before. But, unlike nations with far lesser riches, the LTA still show no sign of knowing how to get prized youngsters through the toughest transition of all, turning from them from talented juniors into successful professionals.","Kyle Edmund has parted company with his coach Greg Rusedski .

"Former England wicketkeeper Geraint Jones has joined Gloucestershire on a two-year deal. Jones enjoyed a successful loan spell at Gloucestershire last season, playing in three LV= County Championship and two NatWest T20 Blast matches, scoring 186 runs. The highlight of his brief spell at the County Ground in Bristol was a knock of 93 in the nine-wicket County Championship Division Two victory against Leicestershire in June. Jones, who left Kent in the summer after 14 seasons with the county, will skipper Gloucestershire in first-class matches as they attempt to gain promotion to Division One next year. Geraint Jones thanked Kent County Cricket Club for the 'fantastic 15 seasons' he spent with them . Gloucestershire director of cricket John Bracewell said: 'With Michael Klinger not re-joining us until June next year, Geraint will captain the team in four-day cricket for the 2015 season. We have spoken to Michael about that and he is comfortable with it. 'We intend using Geraint as a batsman and his presence on the field will be invaluable in offering advice and assistance to our young bowling attack.' Jones added: 'Firstly, I'd like to thank Kent County Cricket Club for the fantastic 15 seasons I spent with them. I learnt a huge amount there and without the opportunities they gave me I never would have had the career that I have. 'Following an enjoyable month on loan with Gloucestershire during 2014, I am excited to be joining the Club on a full-time basis and for the challenges that lie ahead.

'They have a great set up here and I am looking forward to taking on the role as four-day captain and to working in tandem with Michael Klinger. This is a young and talented squad and I relish the opportunity of working with them and to playing a part in their future development. 'I also look forward to working with John Bracewell and his coaching team. They impressed me greatly during my loan period so the chance to work full time with them I know will have big benefits.' Jones made his Test debut against the West Indies in 2004 and was part of the England side that reclaimed the Ashes in thrilling fashion a year later. His 34 Tests yielded 1,172 runs, including one century and six fifties, 128 catches and five stumpings. The 38-year-old has also played 49 one-day internationals for England and has represented Papua New Guinea, the country of his birth, in recent years. Jones has scored 8,615 runs in 193 first-class cricket matches at an average of 32.5, with 15 centuries and 46 fifties. He has also taken 586 catches and made 36 stumpings.

"There can be no relaxing into paternity leave for Novak Djokovic, not when trying to fend off the remarkable charge of Roger Federer back towards the world No 1 ranking. Djokovic has left wife Jelena and new-born son Stefan behind to defend the Paris Masters this week, knowing that Federer is close to striking a blow for the supposed tennis geriatrics by joining fellow 33-year-old Serena Williams at the summit of the season-end rankings. If the Swiss wins this last significant ATP Tour event of the year and Djokovic fails to make the final then the Serb will effectively hand over the position next Monday.

Whether he reaches the top spot will depend partly on how much energy he has, and on whether Djokovic manages to finish the season strongly. Despite his new arrival he insists he is well prepared ahead of tonight’s match with Philipp Kohlschreiber. Djokovic, who was gloriously outplayed in the Shanghai semi-final by Federer earlier this month, is not close to his rival but praised his evergreen qualities: ‘I have a lot of respect for what he does, he’s playing some of his best ever tennis this season,’ said the 27-year-old. ‘Last year was his worst in 10 years but I never signed him out. He’s coming close behind in the rankings and I’m sure he’s going to be very motivated, it’s pretty much open.’ Novak Djokovic and wife Jelena Ristic become parents for the first time last week, calling their son Stefan .

"Jonathan Trott will take his first tentative steps back towards playing Test cricket by being named in an England Lions squad to tour South Africa in January. The 33-year-old batsman who came home from last winter's Ashes tour after suffering a stress related illness has not played international cricket since. But his success with Warwickshire, where he scored three centuries in the last month of the season, has encouraged him and the ECB to believe he is capable of touring again. Jonathan Trott is expected to be named in an England Lions squad to tour South Africa in January . Since returning to action with Warwickshire, Trott has fired 1,156 runs and earned a new three-year deal .

"Pakistan took a stranglehold on the second Test against Australia as they opened up a lead of 370 runs at the end of the third day's play on Saturday. They dismissed Australia for 261 runs to take a first-innings lead of 309. Captain Misbah-ul Haq could have enforced a follow-on, but opted to bat again and set an even bigger target for the opposition. In the second innings, Pakistan reached 61-2, losing the two openers in the 21 overs possible before stumps. Pakistan batsman Mohammed Hafeez (centre) plays a shot during the second Test against Australia . More frustratingly for Australia, Younis Khan, who has now made centuries in each of the three innings of the series, was still out there on 16, with Azhar Ali giving him company on 21 after fast bowler Mitchell Johnson removed the opening batsmen quickly. Pakistan batting coach Grant Flower defended Misbah's decision not to enforce the follow-on. 'I wasn't surprised by the decision, some of our bowlers were tired,' Flower said. 'I think Misbah wanted to make sure there was only one winner in the match by batting again. We will bat till lunch and then try to bowl them out.' Australia's fate was more or less sealed by their inept batting display. The pitch at Sheikh Zayed Stadium still played fair but the Australians showed a distinct lack of application as wickets kept falling at regular intervals. Mitchell Marsh, playing in only his second match for Australia, looked the most comfortable on the crease and was rewarded with his first half century. The 23-year-old son of former Australian star Geoff Marsh was finally dismissed for 87 when he pushed Imran Khan's full toss to Rahat Ali at mid-wicket. Australia fast bowler Mitchell Johnson (left) celebrates dismissing Pakistan batsman Ahmed Shehzad . 'I was really disappointed that I got out that way,' Marsh said. 'I just tried to play my natural game. I wasn't thinking much. I was just trying to put it out of mind that wickets were falling around me.' Imran was the most successful Pakistan bowler with 3-60, including a great delivery to remove Australian captain Clarke, who was looking dangerous on 47. After putting together 64 runs for the sixth wicket with Marsh - the best partnership of the innings - Clarke was completely foxed by Khan's delivery that pitched way outside the off stump and swung back to take his middle stump. David Warner (19) was the first batsman to go Saturday morning, smashing a wide delivery from Ali straight into the hands of Yasir Shah at point. The opener could add only three runs to his overnight score of 16. Glenn Maxwell, who came into the side at the expense of Alex Doolan, was deceived by Zulfiqar Babar when he stepped out once too often and was clean bowled for 37 which came in just 28 balls. Nightwatchman Nathan Lyon vigil's came to an end on 15 when Rahat found a way through his forward defensive shot while Steve Smith did not have the time to settle down before he was trapped leg before wicket by Babar. A draw or a win would give Pakistan a rare series win over Australia. Pakistan have beaten Australia five times before at home, but their last series victory came 20 years ago in 1994.

"Middlesex have called time on their limited-overs name 'Panthers' with immediate effect. The county, who previously played one-day cricket under the controversial 'Crusaders' moniker, have decided to abandon nicknames altogether and will be known simply as Middlesex CCC across all three formats of the game. Chief executive, Vinny Codrington explained: 'When we launched our one-day Panthers brand back in 2009, there was a strong desire for each of the counties to have a vibrant and dynamic one-day name and image, resulting in names such as the 'Dragons', 'Sabres', 'Gladiators' and 'Lions' to name but a few, and we ourselves subsequently became the Middlesex 'Panthers'. Middlesex have called time on their limited-overs name 'Panthers' with immediate effect . 'A lot has changed in Middlesex cricket over the last five years and. We felt that one clear, consistent and immediately recognisable brand would offer greater clarity and assist us in terms of our awareness and recognition within and around the county and further afield as this work continues at pace. 'We are looking forward to being known now simply as 'Middlesex CCC', which to anyone in the game of cricket is a name that immediately evokes feelings of heritage, success and respect - values which we, as a club, pride ourselves on.'

"Senior Pakistan batsman Younus Khan, who capped a memorable test against Australia in Dubai with hundreds in both innings, said he had thought of skipping the two-match series after being dropped from the 50-over squad. The former captain, who will turn 37 next month, had criticised the selectors and the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) after being dropped for the ODI series against Australia. And on Sunday he refused to give credit to the board or the selectors and only thanked Zimbabwean Grant Flower, the team's batting coach, and trainer Grant Ludan for his stellar performance. Younus Khan (above) fired two centuries against Australia in Dubai but nearly decided not to play . Khan (right) said he was not in the right frame of mind after feeling aggrieved at not being selected for ODI side . ""Yes I thought about skipping the test series because I was not in proper frame of mind and struggling. And we are playing against a top side like Australia,"" Younus said after Pakistan's 221-run win. ""But my friends, supporters and the media... I thank them for convincing me to play. ""I am just happy that my performance helped the team win because we needed this win for a while now."" Sunday's win was Pakistan's first over Australia in tests since 2010 and they have not won a test series against Australia since 1994. Younus, who became Pakistan's leading test century maker with 26 hundreds, last month slammed the selectors and board for not showing senior players enough respect. Batsman Khan, 37, led Pakistan to a 221-run victory over Australia in the first of two test matches in Dubai . He had also offered to step down from the test side but the PCB avoided taking any disciplinary action against him despite confirming that Younus had violated code of conduct for players. On Sunday, Younus avoided mentioning the names of team manager Moin Khan, also the chief selector, and head coach Waqar Younis or the PCB at the post-match presentation ceremony. Host Ramiz Raja, a former Pakistan captain, urged him to give credit to the board for selecting him but Younus was in no mood to be generous. ""I give lot of credit to Grant Ludon and Grant Flower who worked hard with me before this test to get me ready for the match psychologically and mentally,"" Younus said. ""Grant Flower spent a lot of time with me in the nets and mentally he prepared me for a bruising time against a top class Australian attack. ""Even though I was hit a couple of times on the body I was expecting this and managed to stay firm."" Pakistan captain Misbah-ul-Haq (right) made an encouraging 69 in the first innings as he looks to return to form . Pakistan captain Misbah-ul-Haq was also under pressure because of his poor form but came good in the test with a 69 in the first innings. The 40-year-old had opted to sit out of the third ODI against Australia because of his lack of runs and there were calls to sack him before next year's World Cup. ""I think such a performance was just round the corner. Now we have a very good chance of becoming the first Pakistani side to win a test series against Australia in a long time and we will not let up in the second test in Abu Dhabi,"" said Misbah.","Younus Khan scored hundreds in both innings as Pakistan beat Australia .

"Pakistan emphatically ended Australia's hopes of regaining the number one Test ranking with a 221-run win in the first Test in Dubai. Australia entered the two-match series needing to win both games to displace South Africa at the top, but will instead head to Abu Dhabi later this week hoping to avoid a first series loss to Pakistan since 1994. Pakistan had won just two Tests against Australia in the intervening period - at one point losing 13 in a row - and while they were without mystery spinner Saeed Ajmal following his ban for an illegal bowling action, their slow men led the way to a memorable success. Zulfiqar Babar took his first five-wicket haul at the age of 35 as Pakistan won the first test against Australia . Mitchell Johnson made a defiant 61 before he was removed by Yasir Shah, stumped by Sarfraz Ahmed . Johnson's stumping paved the way for Pakistan to clean up Australia's tailend and win the first of two test . Left-armer spinner Zulfiqar Babar fittingly completed the job, and his first five-wicket Test haul at the age of 35, when Peter Siddle squeezed a bat-pad catch to Azhar Ali. Zulfiqar and debutant leg-spinner Yasir Shah claimed 14 wickets between them in the match to leave Australia in a spin ahead of the second Test. The tourists lurched to 105 for seven in the morning session before Steve Smith and Mitchell Johnson half-centuries offered the merest hope they might fight out a draw. Smith's wicket was the only to fall during the afternoon session, after he dug in for 55 from 175 balls, before he fell victim to Yasir, who returned four for 50. Smith had expertly used his feet to the slow men but after skipping down to the leg-spinner he popped a catch to short-leg with the umpire review confirming he had to make a slow walk off. Johnson was dejected at losing his wicket in a test Australia needed to win as the seek to top the world ranking . Peter Siddle (right) and Steve O'Keefe (left) leave the field after Australia were bowled out on the fifth day . Johnson then teamed with Siddle in a 43-run stand that took Australia into the final session of the match until he overstretched attempting to smother Yasir's spin. It was a close call that went Pakistan's way as TV umpire Nigel Llong ruled Johnson's back foot was still on the crease as wicketkeeper Sarfraz Ahmed removed the bails. Siddle then survived a reviewed lbw call by the barest of margins before Zulfiqar had him caught pressing further forward to finish with figures of five for 74 and seven wickets for the match.","Pakistan secured a 221-run win over Australia on day five of the first test .

"Lewis Hamilton, who joined Simon Fuller’s management stable to fulfil his dream of fame and riches in America, has decided to take control of his own management affairs. Hamilton turned to Fuller’s XIX Entertainment group after splitting from his father Anthony after the 2009 season, but Sportsmail has learned that his contract with the company recently expired. Although neither side would comment on the development, an industry insider said: ‘Lewis is concentrating on the world championship for now and will assess how to progress with his management around New Year. Championship leader Lewis Hamilton maintained his focus despite a hydraulic problem on Friday . ‘He has been muttering for a year or so about changing his relationship with Fuller. He wants to stand on his own two feet — and cut down on commission fees.’ Paddock sources say Hamilton, who is ranked among the world’s most marketable sportsmen with a £68million fortune, is unlikely to seek a professional reunion with his father, despite Anthony’s recent attendance at races in Italy and Singapore. The pair appear to have mended their sometimes fractious relationship, but Lewis is known to prefer their current father-son bond to a management-client association. Members of Fuller’s staff are continuing to help Hamilton with his public relations for now. But Fuller, the media mogul who managed the Spice Girls and David Beckham, will not be involved in negotiating the driver’s next contract. Fuller’s greatest coup was sealing Hamilton’s current Mercedes contract. It brought his man about £30m-a-year and a winning car. Hamilton was just three thousandths faster than Nico Rosberg in Friday's two practice sessions . However, that deal was struck with Ross Brawn and Nick Fry — both of whom have left the team — as well as Niki Lauda, the non-executive chairman. Relations between Hamilton’s side and Mercedes are not as harmonious since Toto Wolff took over from Brawn. With Hamilton’s contract due to expire next year, a hard and potentially messy negotiation awaits him and his new advisers. A number of paddock veterans, including the late Ayrton Senna’s manager Julian Jakobi, would be keen to enlist Hamilton, but he is likely to eschew Formula One specialists to seek advisers who are more used to the celebrity side. Hamilton, 29, has a love for Hollywood and especially the music industry. His girlfriend is American pop star Nicole Scherzinger, he is friendly with several rap stars and has talked about starting his own record label. Hamilton drives out of his garage during the second practice session at the Circuit of the Americas . He spends much of his time in Los Angeles with Scherzinger, and once told Sportsmail: ‘It’s really cool over here. I love LA and I can see myself maybe living there one day.’ Fuller was mostly notable by his absence from Formula One, allowing Tom Shine, the former Reebok executive, to act as Hamilton’s regular aide and travelling companion, but he has not been at Hamilton’s side for some time. Hamilton came to Austin this weekend via New York, where he appeared — albeit for less than a minute — on NBC’s high-rating Today show. Having got to the Circuit of the Americas, he opened with the fastest time in morning practice, a small step towards recording his fifth consecutive win and extending his 17-point lead over Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg. Can Hamilton keep his momentum through the final three races of the season? Hamilton opened with the fastest time in morning practice on Friday . ‘I don’t see why not,’ he said. ‘But Nico’s going to be strong this weekend. He’s going to be pushing. The tables could always turn. Nico has shown this year that every race he bounces back. He’s strong. And I would do the same. 'We should have a great car this weekend. I’ve been strong here in the past. The last few races I’ve really felt great. When I was trailing to Nico, it was almost like there was a wall and I was trying to climb it but couldn’t quite get over it. But I’ve got over it now.’ Victory here would make Hamilton the most successful British driver in terms of races won (Sir Jackie Stewart won three championships and 27 races at a higher average). He stands on 31 wins, level with Nigel Mansell. Of that piece of beckoning history, Hamilton said: ‘It’s an incredible feeling. I never thought that I would be put on a record board with the greats. To be among the great drivers in the UK is a really proud feeling. Hamilton may have to handle difficult negotiations with Mercedes over a new contract  next year . Agent Simon Fuller (right) has worked with David Beckham, Andy Murray and the Spice Girls . ‘But I don’t really think about it as much, because I just want to win the championship. Perhaps at the end of the year I will be able to look back and really think about it. But I want to win the world championship. That’s the most important thing.’ Hamilton’s hope is that the double points on offer at the last race in Abu Dhabi will not tilt the title away from him. But Rosberg, asked if he would be uneasy winning in this way, said: ‘Not really, no. It is just the way it is in sport unfortunately. ‘It doesn’t really matter, although of course it is a bit artificial.’ He added with a smile: ‘Being behind, I love the double points. It has been the best idea of the season!’ The non-appearance of Marussia and Caterham, who are in administration, means today’s qualifying session will be revamped. Four cars will be eliminated in the first two sessions to leave the usual 10 in the shoot-out for pole, the prime position for which Hamilton is favourite.","Mercedes driver Lewis Hamilton has parted with agent Simon Fuller .

"Daniel Ricciardo is ready for the role of team leader at Red Bull, after a superb season that has seen him outperform reigning World Champion Sebastian Vettel. Vettel is set to leave the team at the end of this season, but Ricciardo feels he is experienced enough to lead Red Bull to glory. The 25-year-old Australian has only been with the team for a year since his promotion from Torro Rosso, but says he can shoulder the extra responsibility. Daniel Ricciardo believes he is ready to be the No 1 driver at Red Bull after an excellent first season . The Australian has out-performed his team-mate, World Champion Sebastian Vettel . 'It's time now for me to take that role,' Ricciardo told Bleacher Report. 'I'm not as experienced as Seb, but I feel I've definitely learned enough now that I can keep the team up at the front where they belong and help them out with developing [the car]. 'I want to be racing at the front, so I'll do what I can to keep it there.'

But he does look likely to finish above Vettel, despite not really being put ahead of his team-mate by Red Bull. However, Ricciardo seems unperturbed by the lack of help from team orders, and is determined to prove himself on the track, without any outside help.

"Sebastian Vettel has indicated hopes of being released early from his Red Bull contract were blocked by the team. It was announced by Red Bull at the start of the month the four-time Formula One champion would be leaving the Milton Keynes-based marque. Red Bull team principal Christian Horner then let the cat out of the bag by stating Vettel would be joining Ferrari. Sebastian Vettel is leaving Red Bull to join up with Ferrari . Neither Vettel nor Ferrari have yet to confirm the news, with Fernando Alonso the man everyone expects to be replaced by the German. It then emerged Vettel would not be released by Red Bull until five days after the closing Grand Prix of the season in Abu Dhabi on November 23. Vettel talks to members of the media ahead of the Hungarian Grand Prix in July . That covers the final three-day test scheduled for the Yas Marina circuit from November 25-27. Vettel has now suggested it was Red Bull who put the brakes on plans to hook up with Ferrari at that test. Asked about joining Ferrari, Vettel initially diverted attention to this weekend's race in the United States. 'First of all I'm looking forward to the race here and to enjoy the last races I will have with the team,' he said. Fernando Alonso is leaving Ferrari at the end of the season to link up with McLaren . 'Obviously, we've experienced a lot in the last couple of years so I think it will be a very special moment coming up in Abu Dhabi for our last race. 'But yes, obviously I'm not allowed to do the test for any team after the race in Abu Dhabi, although right now it's not really my focus. 'I think there are reasons for that and you can understand what they are.' Asked whether he had expected anything different from Red Bull, the 27-year-old replied: 'Not really.' As to why there has been no official announcement of his switch to Ferrari, Vettel added: 'There is not really a specific reason.

"The FIA has again questioned the financial 'failings' of Formula One following the downfall over the past week of Marussia and Caterham. Earlier this season FIA president Jean Todt's plan to introduce a budget cap for 2015 was torpedoed by the major marques. Despite an indication the teams were willing to finally accept a cost cap - after a 2009 proposal under former FIA president Max Mosley was also rejected - it was ultimately thrown out to Todt's fury. The Marussia F1 team have followed Caterham into administration this season . A security officer takes down the British flag as the Caterham  factory in Oxfordshire is closed . Now, in the words of Mosley earlier this week 'the chickens have come to roost', with the financial unsustainability of running a Formula One team leading to Caterham and Marussia entering administration. Offering a clear indication the situation has to change, the FIA has vowed to pursue a situation where the gap between the haves and have nots closes. A statement from the FIA read: 'Looking beyond the end of the 2014 season, these failings again acutely raise the question of the economic balance of the FIA Formula One Championship and justify the position, expressed many times by the FIA, in favour of any initiative that will help reduce costs in order to ensure the survival of the existing grid or attract potential new entrants. FIA president Jen Todt, speaking with F1 supremo Bernie Ecclestone, saw his calls for a budget cap rejected . 'As such, the FIA, in close co-operation with FOM (Bernie Ecclestone's Formula One Management) and the different stakeholders in F1, will continue to work towards maintaining the attraction of the championship and the equitable participation of the teams in it in the years to come.' Many will view the FIA's response as simply hot air as it has so far failed to turn meaningful actions in the past into reality. For now, it would appear the FIA is to treat Marussia and Caterham with leniency in light of their circumstances. Former FIA president Max Mosley has warned that Marussia ‘may not be the last’ to struggle . The sport's regulations dictate a team that fails to fulfil its contractual obligations to the championship would face penalties. For now, Ecclestone has given the two teams dispensation to miss this weekend's race in the United States and the next in Brazil just over a week away. As for the season-ending grand prix in Abu Dhabi, that remains to be seen as administrators are currently trying to find buyers for both organisations. Both Caterham and Marussia have been given special dispensation not to race at the US Grand Prix . The statement added: 'The FIA has been informed of the financial difficulties of the Caterham F1 and Marussia F1 Teams and of the considerable uncertainty surrounding their participation in the final races of the 2014 championship. 'It is the responsibility of the FIA stewards to determine whether or not a team has failed to fulfil its regulatory obligation to take part in all events on the calendar and to take whatever action they deem appropriate. 'However, we have every confidence the stewards are fully aware of the financial situation of the teams concerned and these matters are always assessed with extreme care and due regard for the circumstances involved.'","Formula One teams Caterham and Marussia have gone into administration .

'Fresh from a very turbulent week, I was suddenly given my best early Christmas present ever,' Ericsson said on the team's website. 'The Sauber F1 Team has put its trust in me for 2015, and it makes me proud, as Sauber is known to be one of the best teams in developing young drivers. It will be a great challenge. 'I will give my very best to develop both as a driver, and to be part of the challenge to put the Sauber F1 Team back closer to the front where it belongs.' The move leaves the futures of both Sauber's current drivers Esteban Gutierrez and Adrian Sutil in doubt, with a team statement saying the second driver would be named 'at a later date'. Team principal Monisha Kaltenborn believes the sport is yet to see the best of Ericsson. 'We are pleased to announce this cooperation,' Kaltenborn said. 'We have got to know Marcus as a highly motivated driver. He did not have an easy rookie season this year in Formula One, however, he kept calm and improved continuously, mainly in the last races.

"Martin Murray earned himself a shot at world champion Gennady Golovkin after his fight with Domenico Spada was stopped on a cut in the seventh round. The St Helens middleweight battled his way past the dogged Italian in front of a sizeable travelling support in Monte Carlo. And he will return to the principality on February 21 to face the hard-hitting and unbeaten Kazakh. It will be Murray's third world title shot and the reward for three victories this year under his promoter Golden Gloves. The South Africa-based outfit have played a vital role in re-energising the 32-year-old's career after a period of stagnation. Martin Murray (left) earned his shot at world champion Gennady Golovkin after beating Domenico Spada . Murray holds up his WBC Middleweight Silver Belt after defeating Spada in Monaco . Murray's previous tilts at a world title saw him draw with Felix Sturm in 2011 before losing narrowly to Sergio Martinez in Argentina last year. His third challenge will be even more formidable as Golovkin, who holds the IBO and WBA 'Super' belts looks for his 19th consecutive stoppage. The 32-year-old, who now lives in California, was taken seven rounds by Osumanu Adama on his last visit to Monaco earlier this year. And he was ringside at the Salles des etoiles to see his next challenge survive an early scare before the fight was stopped. All three judges had Murray ahead at the time by scores of 67-66, 68-63 and 69-67. Spada made a bright start, landing several clean shots to the body in his opening round. The Italian took Murray's fellow Brit Darren Barker the distance in a European title fight three years ago and his rugged and awkward style reared it's head again from the second round. But it was Murray who was deducted a point in the third after a clash of heads left Spada cut above his right eye. It was that cut which would later curtail the fight prematurely. Murray battled his way past Spada in Monte Carlo with a stoppage coming in the seventh round . Murray holds up his arm in victory while Spada (right) of Italy reacts following their bout . By the end of the fourth session, however, all three judges had Murray one round up, as revealed by the WBC's open scoring. And certainly, the Brit was beginning to time his shots and avoid being dragged into a dog fight. Golovkin, meanwhile, looked on unperturbed, his boyish grin suggesting he wouldn't lose sleep over his next assignment. By the halfway stage, Murray was finding a home for his hooks which stopped the marauding Spada in his tracks. In the seventh, the referee called on the ringside doctor to examine the challenger's cut for a second time before he waved the fight off. Spada was visibly upset at the decision while Murray must now focus on the toughest challenge of his career. Murray will return to the principality on February 21 to face the hard-hitting and unbeaten Golovkin (pictured)","Martin Murray battles his way past Domenico Spada in Monte Carlo .

"Academy flanker Max Northcote-Green scored two tries on his debut as Bath brushed aside an experimental London Welsh side to get their LV=Cup campaign off to a flying start. Gavin Henson converted three of his side’s seven tries and kicked two penalties in a 47-7 success. It was very much back to ‘bread and butter’ rugby after the visit from the aristocrats of Toulouse and the circus surrounding Sam Burgess’s arrival in midweek - but more than 13,000 again crammed into the Recreation Ground in perfect autumn weather.

Tries from Will Rowlands and Will Helu (two) gave Dai Young’s team a 19-17 advantage at the interval, with Sale responding through touchdowns from Alberto de Marchi and Josh Beaumont, as well as Joe Ford’s penalty. The Sharks went ahead in the second period through Viliami Fihaki and Charlie Ingall scores before the visitors levelled matters courtesy of an Ed Jackson try and Alex Lozowski’s three-pointer, but Macleod was on target in the 77th minute to give the hosts the victory. Robert Barbieri of Leicester Tigers breaks away to score a try against London Irish . Leicester grabbed a hard-fought 17-16 victory over London Irish at the Madejski Stadium. The Tigers were second best in terms of territory and possession for much of the match, but they took their chances to secure the win. Miles Benjamin and Robert Barbieri scored their two tries, with Tommy Bell converting both and kicking a penalty. Irish will wonder how they lost, such was their superiority, but they lacked the control to break down a stubborn Leicester defence. It was not until the 75th minute that they scored their only try through Guy Armitage, and had to rely on three penalties and a conversion from Myles Dorrian for the rest of their points.

"A little over two years ago, Lee Selby could barely fill a Welsh leisure centre but the featherweight from Barry now stands on the verge of winning a world title. A stoppage victory over Australian Joel Brunker at London's O2 Arena earned the 27-year-old the right to challenge IBF belt holder Evgeny Gradovich. Selby, nicknamed the ‘Welsh Mayweather’ due to his slick, evasive style, and formerly the British, European and Commonwealth champion, dominated from he first bell until 11 seconds before the end of the ninth round when a left hook to the body left Brunker on the canvas. Lee Selby (left) dominated Joel Brunker (right) before winning in the ninth round at the O2 Arena in London . Selby's hands are raised as the lad from Barry is officially proclaimed the winner in London . Selby's stock has risen since joining Eddie Hearn at Matchroom last year. Indeed, on Selby's unveiling, his promoter offered to stake his house on his new charge winning a world title. That bet looks more and more like a safe investment as Selby ground his opponent down until the clinical and decisive finish. Brunker, who was unbeaten in 27 fights, had broken up his 10,000 mile journey from New South Wales with a stopover in New York. Selby, known as the Welsh Mayweather, earns the right to challenge IBF belt holder Evgeny Gradovich . But he looked a long way from home as Selby established his distance, measured his shots and found his target. Brunker was content to play the role of the aggressor but left himself open to the Welshman's fast hands. A right hand on the bell for the end of the second was an exclamation mark on another successful session and, save for the odd flash of defiance, Brunker continued to ship punishment in the third round with Selby's right uppercut hitting its target as if laser-guided. After a quieter fourth stanza, Brunker again looked short of ideas as Selby let his hands go before slipping off and out of reach, like a shadow in the night. Selby goes to work from range with his left hand on his way to a convincing win over the Australia . Between them, 25 of their combined 47 fights had gone the distance and by the halfway stage here, that trend looked set to continue. The penny appeared to drop for Brunker at the start of the seventh round, however, as the Australian doubled his work rate in a bid to reduce his deficit. But normal service was resumed in what would prove to be the final session. After twice having Brunker at his mercy against the ropes, Selby finished the job at the third attempt, leaving his opponent winded on the canvas with no chance of recovery. Gradovich, the champion for 18 months, will defend his title against Jayson Velez in Nebraska next month. Selby will be watching with interest.","Lee Selby beat Joel Brunker in their IBF world middleweight title eliminator .

"Australia launched the Michael Cheika era with a victory, but failed to convince in edging past the Barbarians 40-36 at Twickenham. The Barbarians cut Australia's 18-point lead down to just four points late in the second half, but were unable to snatch victory at the death. New coach Cheika kept his autumn Test series cards close to his chest by making 10 changes from the Wallabies side that pushed New Zealand to the brink in 29-28 Bledisloe Cup defeat last month. Barbarian Adam Thomson crosses for a try in the corner in their narrow loss to Australia in the Killik Cup . Former Australia winger Nick Cummins, for the Barbarians, runs at the Wallabies fly-half Quade Cooper . The former Leinster coach's first Australia challenge still ended in victory however, as the Wallabies won out six tries to five in their bid to move past Ewen McKenzie's acrimonious resignation. Sam Carter, Benn Robinson, Tevita Kuridrani, Rob Horne, Bernard Foley and Sean McMahon crossed for the Australians, who struggled for rhythm throughout. The Wallabies had Will Genia and Quade Cooper back in half-back tandem for the first time in a year, but still failed for fluency. Frank Halai, Adam Thomson, Francis Saili, Nick Cummins and Marnitz Boshoff claimed the scores for the Barbarians, John Kirwan's side unlucky not to prevail in the event. Wallabies winger Rob Horne runs in one of Australia's six tries of the match at Twickenham on Saturday . The Barbarians threw out all their trademark trick plays in the first 10 minutes - but were unable to make any count. Luatua's American Football lineout throw rocketed to Cummins in the outside centre channel, catching the Wallabies unawares. The Japan-based flyer knocked on though, killing cheeky move number one. When Colin Slade punted a penalty to the corner rather than for goal, in the ultimate touring-side spirit, the BaaBaas then pumped 11 men into the five-metre lineout. Australia conceded a penalty rather than a try from the drive, teeing up the Barbarians for another sneaky ploy. New Zealander Francis Saili does a celebratory dance after he scores the flair-filled Baa-Baas third try . Tomas Cubelli tapped the five-metre penalty then chipped the ball back over his head, again catching the Australians napping. Slade rose highest in the in-goal area, only to knock the ball on off his shoulder. Just when Australia looked to wrestle the initiative though, Slade kick-started a fine scoring move with an inch-perfect jink and offload out of the tackle to Cummins. The industrious Stephens clawed a pass off his toes in midfield to keep the move alive, before the ball was whipped wide to Halai. The Auckland Blues wing scythed in at the perfect moment to open the scoring. Francis Saili's defence-turning grubber sent Halai racing through again, only for the wing to fly-hack on when he should have scooped up. Cooper sustained Australia's curiously indifferent start by botching a four-man overlap with a needless miss-pass, only for lock Carter to punch over for a try on the next phase. Now based in Japan, Cummins was among the Barbarians' five different try scorers . Wallaby Tevita Kuridrani makes a bust on his way to a try in Australia's narrow win in London . Not even a Television Match Official (TMO) spotted Saia Fainga'a's clear midfield knock-on, leaving the BaaBaas flummoxed. The stubborn Barbarians refused to give in, Saili twice involved in sending Thomson home for the hosts' second score. Slade's conversion handed the BaaBaas the 12-7 advantage, only for Robinson to plough home on a tight drive. Cooper's conversion scrambled Australia a 14-12 lead that Cheika's side retained until the break. The Barbarians gifted Australia the second half's opening score, non-existent midfield defence allowing Kuridrani a cakewalk across the whitewash. Australia's new head coach Michael Cheika (centre) issues his instructions before his first game in charge . All Black Colin Slade got the chance to torment the Aussies again after New Zealand's recent win . The hosts hit back immediately though, Saili chipping the Wallabies defence before beating Sean McMahon to the loose ball to dot down. Slade then slotted a 45-metre penalty to edge the BaaBaas into a 22-21 lead. Wallabies boss Cheika made a raft of changes on 55 minutes, both Cooper and Genia hauled off. And the immediate dividend was Horne's try, the wing profiting as the Barbarians ran out of blindside defenders. Israel Folau blasted clear following a Barbarians break, only for Halai to haul him down and steal the ball. Scrum half Will Genia (centre) was reunited with No 10 Cooper in Cheika's new-look line-up . The Blues wing was hustled into touch though, and the Wallabies' replacement fly-half Foley nipped in from the quick lineout. Foley converted his own try to hand Australia an 11-point lead, before McMahon ghosted home cheaply too. Australia wing Cummins then picked a smart line to race onto Tim Nanai-Williams' blind pass to bag a Barbarians try against his international team-mates. Replacement Boshoff powered away for a score to cut the Wallabies' lead to just four points with a minute to play, but Kirwan's men were unable to turn the tide at the death.","Michael Cheika presided over first game as Australia coach at Twickenham .

"England coach Steve McNamara has named an unchanged side for Sunday's Four Nations match against Australia but has not yet ruled out injured captain Sean O'Loughlin. The Wigan loose forward was forced to sit out England's opening 32-26 win over Samoa in Brisbane on Saturday after failing to recover from a quad muscle injury sustained in his club's Super League Grand Final defeat by St Helens earlier this month. McNamara says O'Loughlin is continuing to make progress in his recovery and could yet be drafted in for the match at Melburne's AAMI Park. England keep the same line-up team that beat Samoa last weekend, but can still make changes . Captain Sean O'Loughlin is 'definitely improving' according to Steve Mcamara, and could make a return . England train at their Gold Coast base on Tuesday, and could still change things before playing Australia . England, who are also thought to be monitoring scrum-half Matty Smith and hooker Daryl Clark after they picked up knocks against the Samoans, have followed protocol by naming their team early in the week but have the right to change it. 'We have named the same 17 as last week,' said McNamara. 'A few of our blokes haven't been able to train fully during the early part of the week. 'Even though we have named the same side, there could be a change or two at the back end of the week. 'Those that were unable to train are making decent progress. Sean O'Loughlin is definitely improving and we will continue to monitor him throughout this week. England beat Samoa 32-26 in Brisbane on the weekend but McNamara admits 'there is room for improvement' Tim Simona fends off England's Matty Smith during a hard-fought win for McNamara's side in their first game . 'It is really difficult to name a team earlier in the week. A firmer decision will be made towards the weekend, when we arrive in Melbourne.' England have stayed at their base on Queensland's Gold Coast following their opening match and will travel to Melbourne on Thursday to complete their preparations for a victory bid which, if successful, would take them through to a first Tri or Four Nations final in the southern hemisphere. England's last victory against Australia was the 1995 World Cup opener at Wembley Stadium, when the hosts won 20-16, although Brian Noble's Great Britain beat the Kangaroos 23-12 in the Tri-Nations Series in 2006 in Sydney. The last time England beat Australia was in 1995, when they won their opening game of the World Cup . Samoa made England work hard for their win on Saturday, and are just one win away from making the final . O'Loughlin is the only member of the 24-man squad to have ever tasted success against Australia, having played in both the 2004 and 2006 Tri-Nations tournaments. If he fails to make the line-up, James Graham will lead the side, as he did against the Pacific Islanders, who twice held the lead and pushed England all the way at Suncorp Stadium. 'It was a hard-fought win for us against Samoa,' McNamara said. 'There is room for improvement within our game. We had to overcome a very talented and tenacious team with limited preparation in extreme heat. Samoa twice took the lead, but England came back to win against 'a very talented and tenacious team' 'I was pleased with the way we dug in and found a way to win in extreme circumstances. We will have to show that same resolve this week.' The organisers have decided not to go with neutral referees, appointing Australian Gerard Sutton for Sunday's game while New Zealander Henry Perenara will be in charge of the Kiwis' clash with Samoa in Wharangei on Sunday.","Captain Sean O'Loughlin not in side but could be drafted in late on .

"Leinster made it four straight wins in all competitions with a bonus point success against injury-hit Edinburgh at the RDS. Two tries from back rowers Dominic Ryan and Jack Conan had Leinster 12-0 up in as many minutes, with Tom Heathcote replying with a lone penalty before half-time. Heathcote had a disappointing night with the boot, though, and man-of-the-match Ryan's 52nd-minute try coupled with a Ben Marshall score put Leinster clear before Tomas Leonardi and Mick McGrath swapped late tries. Mick McGrath (centre) is congratulated by his Leinster team-mates for his try in the 33-8 win over Edinburgh . The only sour point for the hosts was that centre Ben Te'o's debut only lasted 19 minutes as he picked up a hand injury, while Wallaby lock Kane Douglas was also forced off in the first half. Edinburgh made the trip without 20 players, 18 of whom are out injured at present, and were given little hope of claiming their first victory in Dublin in nine years. Flanker Ryan sneaked over for the opening try from close range, catching the Edinburgh defence off guard after they had initially done well to halt a third-minute maul. Jimmy Gopperth missed the conversion but was heavily involved, running hard and kicking intelligently to create early attacking opportunities for Luke Fitzgerald and Zane Kirchner. The Leinster out-half opened his account with a much better conversion of Conan's effort on the right, as the young number eight shrugged off Leonardi's tackle to coast over. Heathcote pulled his first shot at the posts - a 16th minute penalty attempt - wide, and three minutes later rugby league convert Te'o had to make way. The injuries kept coming for Edinburgh with prop Allan Dell limping off, but they deservedly got off the mark thanks to Heathcote's 23rd-minute penalty. Ben Toolis of Edinburgh (left) and Kevin McLaughlin of Leinster compete for the ball during the game at RDS . The Scots began to get Tim Visser involved as they built through the phases, a snappy break from Sam Hidalgo-Clyne giving them further momentum before Heathcote blundered with a second poor penalty miss. Leinster pressed for a try just before the interval but prop Tadhg Furlong was stopped short from Luke McGrath's brilliant blind pass. Fitzgerald ignited the Leinster attack on the resumption by jinking past three Edinburgh players, however both sides were guilty of some aimless play during a turgid third quarter. Leinster lifted the intensity to create a second try for Ryan, a close-in penalty and line-out resulting in the Ireland hopeful crossing for a seven-pointer from a well-executed drive. The visitors hammered away during a prolonged spell near the Leinster line, but Ryan came up with the turnover after Darragh Fanning had thwarted Edinburgh captain Andries Strauss. The bonus point arrived for Leinster in the 63rd minute when a quickly-taken line-out saw replacements Isaac Boss and Peter Dooley pile through, and Tom Denton's pass off the deck put his second row partner Marshall over for a converted try. Edinburgh deserved their 75th minute try as replacements Greig Tonks and George Turner made headway up the right touchline before the latter's pass out of a tackle sent Leonardi clear for the corner. Leinster made sure they had the final say though, Gopperth and Fitzgerald combining to good effect as they sent replacement McGrath over for his second PRO12 try of the season.","Leinster secured their fourth win a row in all competitions at RDS on Friday .

"England will have history behind them and the prospect of making their own when they face Australia on Saturday. Steve McNamara's men know a victory over the Kangaroos would knock their oldest rivals out of the Four Nations, but if they do win they will be getting the better of Australia for the first time since 2006. That in itself was a rare victory over the world champions and a repeat in Melbourne would put the current crop of players in esteemed company. Sam Tomkins (centre) is gunning for an England win against Australia in Melbourne on Saturday . And, for added inspiration, the 17 players selected will wear a specially designed heritage shirt commemorating the jersey worn by the Northern Union side which beat Australia in the 'Rorke's Drift Test' of 1914. 'I think all the lads the are aware of the history rugby league has got. Every time we have the badge on our chest we are playing for a lot of people back at home and people before us,' full-back Sam Tomkins said. 'It's a great way to remember.' A British side led by Harold Wagstaff won the 1914 clash 14-6, with the game being reduced to 11-a-side owing to a shocking list of injuries. The British players were hailed for their bravery and the game was subsequently named in honour of the British troops that had prevailed at Rorke's Drift in Natal. But for all the looking back, Tomkins has his eyes fixed forward. 'Australia are a wounded animal (after losing to New Zealand while England beat Samoa) but they have a lot of fight,' the New Zealand Warriors man added. Steve McNamara knows a victory over the Kangaroos would knock their oldest rivals out of the Four Nations . 'They are coming off the back of a loss that will inspire them even more to do their best to beat us. We'll be prepared and it is exciting - it is a chance for a lot of lads to beat Australia on their first tour. 'We want to knock them out - straight out (of the tournament). We're going to Melbourne to win - we're not going to compete for 60 minutes like we have done. We're going and taking the win.' If they are to do that, then they need to iron out some of the inconsistencies from their 32-26 win over Samoa. 'I'd say we were good in patches, average in patches,' Tomkins said. 'At times we lacked focus in defence, which meant they scored 26 points. It's too many, but we have already reviewed it and we need to improve. 'We fully expected Samoa to come at us for 80 minutes and they did. It's a side littered with good, NRL players. We made it hard.'","England face Australia in the Four Nations on Saturday .

"Mose Masoe says Samoa are out to 'shock the world' when they make their Four Nations debut against England in Brisbane. The St Helens prop forward missed the Samoans' Pacific Cup win over Fiji in May as he concentrated on his first season in Super League but he has been recalled, along with Wakefield half-back or hooker Pita Godinet, for their heavyweight clashes down under. 'I was quite surprised to get in,' said Masoe, fresh from his club's Grand Final triumph. 'They had a good performance against Fiji but the coach kept faith in some of the players who came over here. St Helens prop forward Mose Masoe will be hoping to shock England with Samoa in the Four Nations . 'I'm really stoked to be selected again. It's going to be a great tournament. We've got quite a strong squad too so we can shock the world I guess. 'Our outside backs are handy - a couple played in the Grand Final for the Bulldogs, and we have a forward pack that can match it with the best. 'In the World Cup we showed we can do something and this is another step for us.' Masoe, of course, will be familiar with the opposition while head coach Matt Parish has also been able to call on former St Helens and Great Britain scrum-half Sean Long, the Salford assistant who was his right-hand man during the World Cup and has flown out to Brisbane for the start of the Four Nations Series. Samoa are without former St Helens forward Sia Soliola, who captained them in the World Cup, and their preparations have been overshadowed by the suspension of three of their players amid allegations that they were involved in a nightclub brawl. Parish was forced to leave out Canterbury Bulldogs forward Reni Maitua - a team-mate of England's acting captain James Graham - North Queensland Cowboys centre Tautau Moga and Wests Tigers back-rower Sauaso Sue while Canterbury centre Tim Lafai is unavailable due to his wedding.","Samoa set for Four Nations debut against England in Brisbane .

"Sam Burgess has spoken of his sadness at missing the 2014 Four Nations Series but still hopes to have an influence on the England team as they prepare to take on Samoa. The newly-crowned Rugby League International Federation (RLIF) player of the year presented the England shirts to new caps Joe Westerman, Matty Smith, Josh Hodgson and Daryl Clark on their arrival in Brisbane to prepare for Saturday's opening fixture at the Suncorp Stadium. Burgess is nursing a fractured eye socket and cheekbone, sustained in the opening moments of his man-of-the-match performance for South Sydney in this month's NRL Grand Final, but was already ruled out of England's Four Nations campaign after signing a three-year contract with Bath. Sam Burgess speaks to the media with his Rugby League International Federation player of the year award . He will be unveiled by the Aviva Premiership club next week but was described as 'emotional' when he addressed the England squad on Thursday, shortly after becoming the first English winner of the RLIF award. 'He presented me with my shirt, which was a big honour for me,' said Hull loose forward Westerman via a conference call from Brisbane. 'Growing up, I played against him. 'He has always been an awesome player but to do what he did in the Grand Final and pretty much all his career, it was amazing, it was a real proud moment for me. Burgess (left) played for 80 minutes in the NRL Grand Final with a fractured eye socket and cheekbone . 'He gave a lot of advice to the group and everybody took it on board. It was a bit emotional for him, he wishes he was out there playing with us.' Westerman, who at 24 is a year younger than the former Bradford forward, will make his England debut in place of injured skipper Sean O'Loughlin, his room-mate during England's week-long camp at the Sanctuary Cove Golf and Country Club on Queensland's Gold Coast. He was chosen by head coach Steve McNamara as a straight replacement for the newly-appointed skipper, who is expected to be fit for England's next match against Australia in Melbourne on Sunday week, but Westerman is determined not to give up the shirt without a fight. Burgess scores a try for England against New Zealand in the 2013 Rugby League World Cup semi-final . 'It's been really good rooming with Lockers,' said the former Castleford forward. 'He's a real professional and a great player, someone I've always looked up to. 'I play a lot similar to how he plays. I've got my opportunity this week and I'll do what I can. Hopefully I will do well enough to get a place next week. 'Lockers is captain of the squad and one of the best loose forwards in the world but, if I play well and do all I can, then it's down to Steve depending on the squad he wants to pick.' Westerman, who played the best rugby of his career in 2014, is the only representative from Hull FC in the England squad but he will be reunited on Saturday with former team-mates Michael Shenton, Daryl Clark and Brett Ferres. 'I played with Shenny and Daryl at Cas and Brett as well,' he said. 'It will be good to pull a shirt on with them again. 'I was over the moon when I got picked in the initial squad and the next step was actually getting a game. To get picked to start is a dream come true and I've got to go out there and make the most of it. 'I'm looking forward to how it will feel in the stadium. I can see it being emotional but it will be a good day, especially for my family. It will be a very proud day.'","Newly-crowned rugby league player of the year Sam Burgess presented jerseys to new caps Joe Westerman, Matty Smith, Josh Hodgson and Daryl Clark on their arrival in Australia .

Connacht tighthead Nathan White had been lined up for his Test debut against South Africa, but suffered biceps tendon damage in a training clash on Thursday. Tighthead prop Mike Ross hasn't featured in a month but will be required against South Africa in November . Connacht tighthead Nathan White had been lined up for his Test debut but injured his bicep in training . Stephen Archer and Rodney Ah You are standing by to cover Ross from the bench, but the duo boast just three caps and no Test starts between them. Schmidt lamented the 'catch-22' of sending undercooked Archer, Ah You and further tightheads Declan Fitzpatrick and Tadhg Furlong into provincial action this weekend just a week away from facing the Springboks. 'Nathan White sustained some tendon damage in his biceps in an incredibly innocuous event, but a frustrating one for both him and us,' said Schmidt of the Connacht prop now sidelined for 16 weeks. Ireland coach Joe Schmidt addresses his squad in training on Friday ahead of the Autumn internationals . 'He just caught a player running past him, and it was just the angle, just the way it happened; it's just one of those things. 'Mike Ross is progressing pretty well, so we are quietly confident. He's taken part in some of the more static aspects of training. And he involves himself in some of the more static aspects of the game, so hopefully he comes through and can be involved in some of those. 'Absolutely it's a concern (that Ross has not played for a month). But Mike has been working really hard, in his defence. 'There's nothing like game conditions though, to bring game awareness. You want guys to have had that; you want it to be second nature, what they are doing. Jamie Heaslip (centre) and the rest of the Ireland squad are put through their paces at the Aviva Stadium . 'If it was a perfect world things might different but you work in the world that's available to you, and I'd still say it's an incredibly exciting challenge to play one of the form teams in the world, and certainly one of the top-ranked.' Ireland will launch their three-Test Guinness series against South Africa at the Aviva Stadium on Saturday, November 8, without at least 15 regulars missing through injury. James Cronin will miss the entire series with ankle trouble, compounding loosehead prop resources and adding to Jack McGrath's workload with Cian Healy a long-term absentee. Schmidt admitted he had to resist the temptation to pull the likes of Ah You and Archer out of club action this weekend, believing they must sharpen up ahead of potential Test action. The Ireland squad held an open training session to the public on Friday in Dublin at the Aviva Stadium . 'Obviously Rodney Ah You is playing for Connacht against the Ospreys, and Stephen Archer will have some time at Munster,' he said. 'Tadhg Furlong will play for Leinster and Declan Fitzpatrick for Ulster, those are our other options. 'It's a catch-22, because Nathan White was the starting prop at Connacht and has really dominated the starting time (and) Rodney needs the game time. 'Tadhg Furlong certainly needs to play; he's been sat behind Michael Bent. Munster winger Simon Zebo poses for pictures with fans at the Aviva Stadium in Dublin on Friday . 'Declan Fitzpatrick has been massively underplayed because he's had a succession of injuries and Stephen Archer the same. 'So it's not a lot of rugby for those guys in the last two weeks to then have a week off and go into a Test match, it would be pretty difficult. 'So we're just going to hold our breath and hope that those guys come through okay and that we'll have some options live from that group.'","Ireland host South Africa, Georgia and Australia in the Autumn series .

"Former England captain Martin Corry doubts Sam Burgess has enough time to prove himself worthy of a place in Stuart Lancaster's World Cup squad. Burgess was officially unveiled by Aviva Premiership club Bath on Thursday after completing his high-profile move from rugby league. The 25-year-old Yorkshireman will have to wait until December for his debut as he recovers from a fractured cheekbone and eye socket and Corry fears England 2015 may come to soon. Sam Burgess poses for the cameras at The Rec at his Bath unveiling on Thursday . Burgess chats to his new Bath team-mate George Ford at The Rec on Friday . Burgess played for England 13 times in the 13-man code, scoring seven tries . 'I don't want to get caught up in all this hype,' Corry told BBC Radio 5 Live. 'Sam has to come out and prove himself. The timeframe does scare me - can someone be fast-tracked so quickly?' Doubt hangs over Burgess' best position in union with Bath viewing him as a back row, while England have identified him as a possible solution to their long-term problems at inside centre. Corry, who won 64 caps in a distinguished Test career that ended in 2007, believes Burgess' power game and offloading skills are best suited to the midfield. 'Bath want him in the back row and England want him in the centre,' Corry said. Corry (centre) was part of the England squad that finished runners-up at the 2007 World Cup . 'The danger is Bath may have the problems Andy Farrell had with his integration, whereby Saracens started using him in the back row before realising he should be playing in the centres. 'I'd like to see him play at 12 because that's where England could use him and the position where he could be a game changer in exactly the same way Sonny Bill Williams is used by New Zealand. 'The problem is that Bath's two centres are playing some phenomenal rugby. 'Do they leave out Kyle Eastmond for someone who is as yet unproven?' Burgess' fellow league convert Kyle Eastmond has been in sensational form for Bath playing at inside centre . England coach Lancaster is keen to let Burgess settle at the Recreation Ground. 'Obviously I've spoken to him during the period when we knew he was going to arrive here, but I'll leave him pretty much to bed in at Bath,' Lancaster said earlier this week. 'I'm sure he'll have one eye on our games, but I think he'll need to get bedded in at Bath.'","Sam Burgess joined Bath this week after switching from rugby league .

"France's Alexander Levy was surprised by his own brilliant form after claiming a commanding lead in the BMW Masters in pursuit of a third win of the season. Levy, who shot rounds of 63 and 61 to win the rain-shortened Portugal Masters three weeks ago, fired a third round of 63 at Lake Malaren to reach 22 under par, four strokes ahead of Ryder Cup hero Jamie Donaldson, who compiled a brilliant 62. The 24-year-old tournament leader failed to win any of his three group matches in the Volvo World Match Play Championship but is now a combined 40 under par for his last five stroke play rounds and has made 23 birdies and just one bogey in 54 holes in Shanghai. Alexander Levy acknowledges the applause of the crowd after making a putt on the third day in Shanghai . Levy overtook his playing partner Nicolas Colsaerts to assume the lead at the BMW Shanghai Masters . 'I played amazing golf,' said Levy, who won his first European Tour title in the Volvo China Open in April. 'I'm very surprised by myself. I started well and made some early birdies and hit some amazing shots. I am very happy with the way I played golf today.' Levy began the day a shot behind halfway leader Nicolas Colsaerts, but birdied the first three holes and picked up further shots on the sixth and seventh to reach the turn in 31, before almost holing his approach to the 10th to set up another birdie. The tee on the par-four 11th had been moved forward to encourage players to attempt to drive the green and although Levy was one of the few players not to take it on, his decision was vindicated when he played another brilliant wedge shot to two feet. Donaldson was matching Levy's scoring exploits, the Welshman covering the front nine in 32 and picking up further shots on the 10th, 11th, 13th and 14th before holing his second to the 16th for an eagle two. Levy almost replied with an eagle of his own, narrowly missing from eight feet on the par-five 15th, but the birdie extended his lead to four shots over Donaldson, with Germany's Marcel Siem another stroke back after a 65. Levy (left) smiles as he takes over at the top of the leaderboard from Belgian Colsaerts (right) Colsaerts carded two birdies and one bogey  to lose ground having started round three with a one-shot lead . 'It's nice to be in this position,' Levy added. 'It was pretty much the same when I won in China so I am going to enjoy the game tomorrow, do my best and see what happens.' Donaldson's scored matched his course record from 2012, although it will not count for record purposes due to the preferred lies in operation. 'Obviously the course suits my game,' said the 39-year-old, who won the Czech Masters in August to secure his Ryder Cup debut and then clinched the winning point at Gleneagles by beating Keegan Bradley in the singles. 'I've shot 10 under before and I've done it today which is great. I got the ball rolling better on the greens which made a big difference and obviously that shot on 16 is a big bonus. 'I had 142 (yards) to the flag, slightly uphill into the wind which was a soft nine iron and it came off spot on. Pitched just past the hole and spun back and went in. It's quite a narrow entrance into that green from where I was but it pitched perfect and obviously is a bonus to see it go in. 'I've been playing well for a few years now so things have been getting better each year. I've been improving and winning was just a matter of time. Now it's obviously to a point where I'm trying to win more than once in a year. Everything is a progression and I'm just working towards getting better and moving the goal posts.' Justin Rose and Ryan Palmer have a chat on the seventh hole during the third round of the BMW Masters . Ryder Cup star Jamie Donaldson found himself five shots behind Levy . Donaldson's Ryder Cup team-mate Justin Rose was four over par after four holes on Thursday and although he recovered to shoot 72 and then add rounds of 65 and 64, still found himself seven shots off the lead. 'I think I've done my part but I didn't bank on everyone else going as low as they are,' Rose said. 'Obviously Mr Levy is going ridiculous out there right now. I would have thought I'd be in a bit better shape going into Sunday than I am, but every credit to the lads that are keeping it going out there. 'If everything went my way today, five better is what I could have been. I missed probably five putts inside eight feet today and still shot eight under par. I had three eagle putts out there, so plenty of opportunities to go low. 'Quite clearly there's lots of birdies to be had out there and I don't know if things are going to change tomorrow, I hear there's a bit of wind coming in so that might spice things up.' Overnight leader Colsaerts is nine shots off the pace after a 73 which included a double-bogey six on the 18th.","France's Alexander Levy leads after the third round of Shanghai Masters .

"Robert Streb earned his first PGA Tour win on Sunday by closing with a seven-under 63 and making a four-foot birdie putt on the second play-off hole in the McGladrey Classic. The victory sends Streb to the Masters in April. The 27-year-old from Oklahoma has never played in a major. He won a three-man playoff over Brendon de Jonge of Zimbabwe and Will MacKenzie.

"Will MacKenzie hit a hole-in-one and four birdies on Saturday as he took a share of the lead at the McGladrey Classic in Georgia. The 30-year-old American aced the three-par sixth hole on his way to carding a five under 65, which puts him level with Andrew Svoboda at the top of the leaderboard. MacKenzie joins Svoboda - who will be left lamenting a double bogey on the 11th as he notched his third successive 66 - on 12 under overall and they share a one-shot lead over the rest of the field going into the final day. Will MacKenzie drives his ball off the 10th tee during the third round of the McGladrey Classic . Despite hitting the hole-in-one on the front nine, MacKenzie explained how the experience was 'boring' after there was confusion over whether he had actually managed the feat or not. 'Most anti-climactic hole-in-one I ever had,' he said on the PGA Tour website. 'Finally, there was this random guy over there, like one of the four guys clapping earlier. They were like, ""Yeah, it went in. Didn't you hear us clap?"" I was like, ""Thanks, man. You guys are low-key here"". 'They're used to seeing great shots. They're used to your Matt Kuchars and the guys, studs. I made a hole-in-one. It means nothing other than it was a 1 on the scorecard. It was just the most boring hole-in-one ever.' Andrew Svoboda shares the lead with MacKenzie on 12 under par after a third-round 66 . Overnight leader Russell Henley dropped a shot on the five-par 15th and could only manage three birdies as he carded 68 to sit in third on 11 under. Stewart Cink leads a five-strong group two shots further back after he carded eight birdies to get the best score of the day on 63. Andrew Putman and Chris Kirk both carded rounds of 66 to join Cink on nine under, alongside Fabian Gomez and Brendon de Jonge. Swede Carl Pettersson is highest-placed European in Georgia on six under after he hit two bogeys and the same number of birdies to finish on 69.

"Thorbjorn Olesen sealed his second career European Tour title on Sunday with a final-round 71 to see off the challenge of Victor Dubuisson at the Perth International. The 24-year-old Dane took a three-shot lead into the final day at Lake Karrinyup Country Club, and eventually held on to win by as many strokes from Dubuisson. The Frenchman signed for a closing 66 to finish in outright second after a bogey-free round that featured six birdies. Thorbjorn Olesen poses with the trophy after winning the Perth International with a final score of 17 under par . Olesen, pictured teeing off on the 17th green, went on to win the tournament at Lake Karrinyup by three shots . Olesen was one over through 12 holes, but birdied the 13th and 15th to regain a commanding lead and eventually finish at 17 under. The win marked Olesen's second title on the European circuit after his maiden breakthrough at the Sicilian Open in April 2012. 'It was tough - they were not easy conditions today,' the world number 130 said on www.europeantour.com. 'I missed a few short putts today in the middle of the round and I think that the lead got down to one shot, but I was just thinking about getting my round back to under par, keeping focused, and seeing if I could make a few birdies coming in. Runner-up Victor Dubuisson of France marks his card on the 18th fairway during the final round . Dubuisson's final round of 66 was not enough to catch winner Olesen as he settled for second place . 'It was a tough day but it was worth it - that walk down 18 was beautiful. 'My driving and a couple of three woods were off line, which made it tricky, but I made some great putts coming in. 'It's been a couple of years since I won last time, so this gives me a lot of confidence and belief for the last bit of the season.' Mark Foster claimed third place on 12 under after a 69, one shot ahead of a group of five tied for fourth - fellow Englishman James Morrison (73), Scot David Drysdale (71), Dane Lucas Bjerregaard (70), American Steve Dartnall (70) and Australian Matthew Griffin (67).

'It's great, really exciting,' he said. 'I'm looking forward to standing on that first tee tomorrow and to get the last round going and see if I can play some good golf.

"Nicolas Colsaerts revealed how he was inspired by Europe's Ryder Cup victory at Gleneagles after taking the halfway lead in the BMW Masters in Shanghai. Colsaerts was part of the winning team at Medinah in 2012 but failed to make the team this year and had to settle for commentating on the event instead on radio. The 31-year-old responded by coming agonisingly close to recording the first 59 in European Tour history in his next competitive round in the Portugal Masters, where he finished second to France's Alexander Levy in an event reduced to 36 holes by bad weather. Nicolas Colsaerts hits his tee-shot on the ninth hole during the second round of the BMW Masters . One fan jokes with Colsaerts in Shanghai, but the Belgian didn't appear to get the joke . Former Ryder Cup star Colsaerts, who shot a brilliant 64 on Friday, hits an approach at Lake Malaren Golf Club . A superb 64 at Lake Malaren on Friday ensured those positions were reversed, with Colsaerts on 14 under and overnight leader Levy 13 under after adding a 66 to his opening 65. 'I felt like I've been in the zone a couple of times lately and it doesn't really happen in such a short period of time like this,' said Colsaerts, who won the 2012 Volvo World Match Play Championship but struggled to reproduce that form when he tried his luck on the PGA Tour last season. 'So it's pretty nice when you can get it going like this and I've been playing quite well for the last couple of months. 'I'm comfortable being back here now. I'm quite happy being here and playing the way I am capable of.' Speaking about being reduced to the role of spectator at Gleneagles, the world No 142 added: 'Even though I was far out of making that team, I still felt that I was that type of calibre player. 'When you get to see it like that from the outside, I certainly was missing it. I wish I could have been playing in it and it's almost like you go back the week after and you just keep that intensity that you've seen at the Ryder Cup and bring that out in the next tournament. 'You realise how golf should be played on some of the courses and not be afraid of taking command. When you see match play for a week like that, it's actually quite interesting to see how low you can go and maybe in stroke play sometimes we're a little bit more playing on the safe side of things.'

England's former US Open champion plays his second shot on the fifth hole as his caddie 'Fooch' looks on . Marcel Siem of Germany and his caddie walk towards the green on the fifth hole during the second round . Levy, who won the Volvo China Open in April and shot rounds of 63 and 61 to win in Portugal three weeks ago, looked set to increase his one-shot overnight lead when he birdied four of his first seven holes and picked up another shot on the 11th. However, he failed to get up and down from right of the 12th green to drop his first shot of the week and although he birdied the 14th and 15th, the 24-year-old was unable to catch Colsaerts. Fellow Frenchman and hotel room-mate Romain Wattel was two shots further back on 11 under, with Marcel Siem, Branden Grace and Emiliano Grillo all 10 under and Thomas Bjorn alone in seventh another shot adrift. Bjorn got off to a nightmare start with a bogey on the first and triple-bogey eight on the third, but then carded nine birdies in the last 15 holes to record a 67 in his first tournament since the Ryder Cup. 'I've had a really bad neck leading all the way into the Ryder Cup really, but kind of kept that quiet and kept going,' said the 43-year-old, who was subsequently a late withdrawal for the World Match Play Championship. 'And then the body after that week just couldn't keep up with it any more. 'The Match Play wasn't to be. I literally could not get out of bed for three days. It's just one of those things, I'm getting a bit older now.' Justin Rose was two shots behind Bjorn as his own comeback continued, the world No 6 recovering from being four over after four holes to card an opening 72 and adding a superb 65 on Friday. 'It was much needed,' said Rose, who was unbeaten in five matches and the top points scorer in Europe's Ryder Cup triumph at Gleneagles. 'The leaderboard lit up today. 'The guys took advantage of the scoring conditions and basically my seven under was needed to just somewhat keep pace. I played well and had the opportunity to go quite a few lower, too.'","Nicolas Colsaerts leads the BMW Masters on 14 under par after two rounds .

"A spectacular hole-in-one helped Lee Westwood surge into contention for the CIMB Classic at Kuala Lumpur Golf and Country Club on Friday. Westwood needed a hybrid club on the 226-yard 11th hole, but saw his perfectly-struck tee shot land 10 feet from the pin and roll inexorably into the hole. 'Well that was a pretty special day,' he posted on Twitter. 'It's not often you see them go in from 226 yds!' VIDEO Watch Lee Westwood's brilliant hole-in-one during the CIMB Classic . Lee Westwood's shot landed 10 feet away from the pin before rolling into the hole at the Country Club . Westwood could not remember how many times he had hit a hole-in-one after his round .

T3. Jeff Overton -7 . T3. Kevin Chappell -7 . T3. Ryan Moore -7 . T3. Sergio Garcia -7 . T3. Lee Westwood -7 . T3. Kevin Na -7 . 'I actually don't know exactly,' Westwood said. 'Someone asked me walking to the green how many I thought I'd had. I think somewhere around 14. I'm not sure. 'You remember the ones that you won something for. I had a hole-in-one in Germany once and won a bar of gold, and that's the only time I've ever won anything. Occasionally there's been a bottle of champagne for a hole-in-one. I remember pretty much where all of them are, but I'm sure I've forgotten one or two. 'You need a bit of luck, but at the same time you gotta hit it well and straight, so it happens now and again. I was aiming towards 20 feet left of the hole and trying to hit a bit of a high cut because it was just too much club. It just came out perfect. 'And I went back out after the rain delay and birdied two of the last three and had a really good chance at 17 as well, so I'm pleased with the way I finished and 65 has got me right into the tournament.' English golfer Westwood said it 'was a pretty special day' after the impressive hole-in-one shot . The 41-year-old, who won the Maybank Malaysian Open on the same course on the European Tour in April, had already picked up three birdies on the front nine and added more on the 16th and 18th to complete a flawless 65. That took the former world No 1 to seven under par and three shots behind halfway leader Billy Hurley, who recorded his second consecutive 67. Fellow American Kevin Streelman was two shots back after two rounds of 68, with Westwood sharing third place with playing partner and Ryder Cup team-mate Sergio Garcia, Korea's Noh Seung-yul and American quartet Jeff Overton, Ryan Moore, Kevin Na and Kevin Chappell.

"England's Lee Westwood will look to complete a unique double at Kuala Lumpur golf and country club this week. Westwood is part of a 78-strong field for the CIMB Classic, which is co-sanctioned by the PGA Tour and Asian Tour and is being held on the same course where he won the Maybank Malaysian Open on the European Tour in April. And the former world number one could then make it an impressive three wins on the same course in 10 months, with the Malaysian Open switching to February on the 2015 European Tour schedule. Lee Westwood is going for a second win at the Kuala Lumpur golf and country club in the CIMB Classic . 'I'm playing nicely at the moment,' Westwood told a pre-tournament press conference. 'I played well in Napa (finishing 12th at the Frys.com Open) a couple of weeks ago and it's nice for me that it's a nice setting here.' Westwood won his 13th tournament in Asia the week after finishing seventh in the Masters and added: 'I played it at 18-under-par and won by seven so you'd have to say it suits my game. That was a great week and it's strange I'm going to be playing three tournaments in 10 months on this golf course. 'It doesn't often happen and there's obviously the reason for that...it's obviously a good golf course because they keep putting tournaments around it and people enjoy playing it. Westwood, pictured during round one of the Frys.com Open, finished 12th at the tournament in Napa . 'I'm the most recent winner around this golf course so I'm pretty confident as far as this week's tournament is concerned.' Westwood has won in Korea, Indonesia, Thailand, Japan, Macau and Malaysia and knows exactly what is needed to succeed in the testing conditions which can usually be relied upon to spark afternoon thunderstorms. 'You're not going to function if you get dehydrated out there and lose energy,' the 41-year-old added. 'Your brain is going to stop working and then you need to use your common sense and have good course-management skills. The Englishman will play alongside Sergio Garcia and Patrick Reed in the first two rounds of the CIMB Classic . 'I think there are a lot of opportunities to take holes on out there, but at the same time there are a lot of opportunities to play conservatively and take par on certain holes. You don't want to be coming out of the rough, because the greens seem to stay firm.' Westwood will play alongside Ryder Cup team-mate Sergio Garcia and Gleneagles opponent Patrick Reed in the first two rounds. The winner will claim $1.2million from the overall prize fund of $7million, as well as a place in next year's Masters at Augusta.","Lee Westwood won the Maybank Malaysian Open in April .

McIlroy holds a commanding lead of more than three million points over Sergio Garcia as he looks to win the Race to Dubai and PGA Tour money list titles for the second time in three years. However, the world number one is missing both the BMW Masters and WGC-HSBC Champions events in Shanghai in order to prepare for a court case with his former management company, increasing the admittedly slim possibility of being overhauled by the likes of Garcia and current European number one Henrik Stenson. Rory McIlroy, pictured at the Ryder Cup, will sit out the BMW Masters and the WGC-HSBC Champions event . McIlroy has a commanding lead in the Race to Dubai and is unlikely to be overtaken . Garcia and Stenson will not be at Lake Malaren either this week, with the Spaniard opting to compete in the CIMB Classic in Malaysia on the PGA Tour instead, while Stenson withdrew following the birth of his third child on Sunday. Each event in the Final Series has a prize pool of 10 million points with 1,666,600 going to the winner, while McIlroy is guaranteed to earn at least the 27,170 points on offer for last place in the season-ending DP World Tour Championship. That will take the 25-year-old's total to just over 5.4million, meaning his rivals will need to have reached at least 3.8million before Dubai to have a chance of overhauling the four-time major winner. For Garcia, who has committed to play in the HSBC Champions and the Turkish Airlines Open, that equates to a runner-up and top-five finish, while Stenson will need even better results to keep his hopes alive. Sergio Garcia, pictured in action at the Ryder Cup, has a slim chance of winning the Race to Dubai . McIlroy poses with his Player of the Year trophy at the Port Royal golf course in Bermuda . With so many points on offer, all of the top 20 players have a chance of being within striking distance of McIlroy with a first and second place finish over the next three weeks, but eighth-placed Justin Rose has other goals in mind. The top 15 players after Dubai will share a bonus pool of 5million US dollars and Rose is also looking to move up from his current position of sixth in the world rankings. 'I'm not sure I can catch Rory but the bonus pool runs deep down to 15th and I want to strengthen my world ranking as much as possible,' the 2013 US Open champion told a pre-tournament press conference. 'If I can play well and maybe win a couple of tournaments between now and the end of the season, I could probably get up to second in the world, which would be a personal best. So there's always something to play for.' Rose warmed up for the BMW Masters by beating Ryder Cup team-mate Ian Poulter in a match to mark the opening of a course they designed in Hainan, continuing his excellent match play form after being Europe's top points scorer at Gleneagles last month. Justin Rose takes part in the Pro Am at Lake Malaren ahead of the first day of the BMW Masters . Rose plays out of the sand on Wednesday, a day before attempting to improve his world ranking in Shanghai . Poulter is a lowly 64th on the money list after just one top-five finish on the European Tour this season, but is looking to continue his impressive record in the Far East. The 38-year-old was 15th at Lake Malaren last year and fourth in 2012, as well as having won in Shenzhen, Singapore and Hong Kong. 'I've got a decent record here in Asia,' Poulter said. 'I played very strong the back end of last year. I've played well on this golf course in the past, so I'm looking forward to getting going. 'I've been close here. I like the layout, I like the way it looks, and if the weather holds off for us and is kind then it's going to be a great week. 'The success over here obviously means that I've got a good following, and hopefully that may long continue.'","Rory McIlroy holds a commanding lead in the Race to Dubai .

"Ian Poulter has received a grovelling apology from sacked PGA of America president Ted Bishop, who had branded the Ryder Cup star a ‘lil girl’. Bishop was given the boot after firing off a series of abusive tweets and Facebook comments aimed at Poulter. He was reacting to the English Ryder Cup hero’s critical comments about Tom Watson and Nick Faldo in his recently published autobiography. Comparing Faldo’s superior major and Ryder Cup record with Poulter’s, Bishop had tweeted: ‘Yours v His? Lil Girl.’ Poulter hit back at the 38th PGA president, labelling the comments ‘pretty shocking and disappointing’, and on Friday the PGA of America announced it had voted to relieve Bishop of his duties. Ted Bishop aimed an assault at Ian Poulter, who had criticised Nick Faldo's captaincy at the 2008 Ryder Cup . Poulter said the comments made by Bishop were 'disappointing for the leader of the PGA of America' Bishop has since apologised, saying: ‘This is a classic example of poor use of social media on my part and if I had the chance to hit the delete button on the things that I sent out yesterday, I would without hesitation.’ The row was sparked by comments in Poulter’s book No Limits, in which he branded Watson’s captaincy at Gleneagles last month as ‘utterly bizarre’ and also reopened an old feud with Faldo. European captain at the 2008 Ryder Cup, Faldo said while commentating on this year’s match that Sergio Garcia was ‘useless’ during the loss to the United States at Valhalla six years ago. Poulter said Sir Nick Faldo has lost a lot of respect from players because of his comments about Sergio Garcia . The Englishman also hit out at Tom Watson for dropping Phil Mickelson and Keegan Bradley at the Ryder Cup . Noting it was Europe’s only loss in the past 15 years and that Faldo was captain, Poulter wrote: ‘So who’s useless? I think Faldo might need to have a little look in the mirror.’ In Bishop’s tweet, which has since been deleted, he retorted: ‘Faldo’s record stands by itself. Six majors and all-time RC points. Yours vs. His? Lil Girl.’ Poulter, who has yet to triumph in a major, said: ‘Is being called a “lil girl” meant to be derogatory or a put down? That’s pretty shocking and disappointing, especially coming from the leader of the PGA of America.’ Poulter and Garcia (right) celebrate with the trophy after Europe's Ryder Cup victory earlier this year .","Ted Bishop called Ian Poulter 'a little girl' for his criticism of Sir Nick Faldo and Tom Watson .

"Main Sequence, who failed to land a race in nine British starts after finishing second to Camelot in the 2012 Derby, narrowly denied Europe a first win at the Breeders’ Cup at Santa Anita on Saturday as he held off France’s Flintshire in the $3million Turf. It was a fourth grade one win since crossing the Atlantic for the Niarchos family-owned chestnut, whose lack of success in Britain led to him being gelded before leaving Lambourn trainer David Lanigan to join English-based US trainer Graham Motion. Motion said: ‘The race set up beautifully. This horse is a machine. He’s really suited to American racing and he just gets better and better. He’s a very impressive horse. Main Sequence wins $3million Turf for the USA ahead of France's Flintshire at the Breeders' Cup . Andre Fabre’s Arc runner-up Flintshire briefly looked like he had made a winning move until cut down in the final strides and lose out by half a length. Fourth, beaten just over two lengths, was Sir Michael Stoute’s Telescope, the colt part-owned by Sir Alex Ferguson. He was a place in front of Aidan O’Brien’s Chicquita while Michael Owen-owned, Tom Dascombe-trained Brown Panther faded after racing prominently to finish 11th of the 12 starters. Stoute said of Telescope, who will stay in training next year, said: ‘He’s run a good race, but the race wasn’t really run to suit him. He needs to be able to do it one long progression. He’s a long striding horse for a track like this.’ With only two races remaining, the best Europe had managed at the 31st Breeders’ Cup was the third of Richard Hannon’s Osaila in Friday’s Juvenile Filly Turf and the third of Charlie Hills-trained Just The Judge in yesterday’s Filly & Mare Turf behind all-the-way Chad Brown-trained winner Daysatthespa.

He said: ‘They didn’t go fast enough in the middle part of the race for her.’ Aidan O’Brien’s The Great War was unplaced behind wide-margin winner Texas Red in the Juvenile while David Simcock’s Caspar Netscher failed to land a blow on Bobby’s Kitten in the Turf Sprint. The second Brown-trained winner of day two of the meeting, who narrowly denied Frankie Dettori’s mount No Nay Never, could be heading to Royal Ascot next year.

"Ian Poulter was embroiled in a bitter social media row with the president of the PGA of America on Friday after being branded ‘a little girl’ for his criticisms of Sir Nick Faldo and Tom Watson. PGA chief Ted Bishop aimed a puerile assault at the Englishman after Poulter, in his recent book No Limits, lashed out at Faldo’s captaincy of the defeated European team at the 2008 Ryder Cup. Writing on his Twitter account, Bishop wrote: ‘Faldo’s record stands by itself. Six majors and all-time RC points. Yours vs. His? Lil Girl.’ Ted Bishop aimed an assault at Ian Poulter, who had criticised Nick Faldo's captaincy at the 2008 Ryder Cup . Poulter said the comments made by Bishop were 'disappointing for the leader of the PGA of America' In a separate post on his Facebook page, Bishop cited Poulter’s criticisms of Watson’s decisions as US captain in this year’s Ryder Cup, writing: ‘Used to be athletes who had lesser records or accomplishments in a sport never criticised the icons. ‘Tom Watson (8 majors and a 10-3-1 Ryder Cup record) and Nick Faldo (6 majors and all-time Ryder Cup points leader) get bashed by Ian James Poulter. Really? Sounds like a little school girl squealing during recess. C’MON MAN!’ Bishop later deleted the messages, with Poulter hitting back in a statement: ‘Is being called a “lil girl” meant to be derogatory or a put down? Poulter said Sir Nick Faldo has lost a lot of respect from players because of his comments about Sergio Garcia . The Englishman also hit out at Tom Watson for dropping Phil Mickelson and Keegan Bradley at the Ryder Cup . ‘That’s pretty shocking and disappointing, especially coming from the leader of the PGA of America. No further comment.’ The PGA of America said Bishop, whose two-year term in the post ends next month, ‘realised that his post was inappropriate and promptly removed it’. The 60-year-old later said: ‘Obviously I could have selected some different ways to express my thoughts on Poulter’s remarks. ‘Golf had always been a sport where respect was shown to its icons. That seems to have gone by the wayside.’ Faldo is the only losing European Ryder cup captain this century, and during commentary for this year’s tournament he riled Paul McGinley’s team when he said Sergio Garcia was ‘useless’ during the loss in 2008. Poulter and Garcia (right) celebrate with the trophy after Europe's Ryder Cup victory earlier this year . ‘Faldo has lost a lot of respect from players because of what he said,’ Poulter wrote. ‘2008 is the only Ryder Cup we’ve lost in the last 15 years. And he was captain. So who’s useless? I think Faldo might need to have a little look in the mirror.’ Poulter was also critical of eight-time Major winner Watson’s call to drop Phil Mickelson and Keegan Bradley for both sessions on Saturday at this year’s Ryder Cup, which Europe won 16½-11½. Poulter said Watson’s decision-making ‘completely baffles me’ and called it ‘utterly bizarre’. Bishop, a controversial figure in American golf, made 65-year-old Watson the oldest captain in Ryder Cup history. He recently announced that a task force had been appointed to help solve America’s recent losing streak in the Ryder Cup.","Ted Bishop called Ian Poulter ‘a little girl’ for his criticisms of Sir Nick Faldo and Tom Watson .

"Richard Hannon believes the light campaign Toronado has had in Europe will be key in Saturday's Breeders’ Cup Mile as he bids to end a dream debut season as a trainer in style. Hannon had a hard act to follow taking over from his five-time champion father, Richard Snr. Being handed control of one of the most powerful yards in the land has obvious advantages but his son has taken it to new heights. He is champion trainer with prize-money of almost £4.7million, a total his father never reached. Toronado goes into the Breeders' Cup Mile on the back of a relatively light campaign . Trainer Richarde Hannon and jockey Richard Hughes (R) are looking to cap off an exceptional season . There has been a first Classic from Night Of Thunder in the 2,000 Guineas, plus four other Group One victories including Toronado in the Queen Anne Stakes at Royal Ascot. With Richard Hughes on board a Breeders’ Cup success, worth more than £650,000, would also outstrip his father, who does not have fond memories of America’s biggest meeting. Paco Boy’s fourth in the 2010 Mile was the best he achieved from nine starters, a record which also included the fatal fall of Mr Brooks in the 1992 Sprint and a nightmare run which deprived Sky Lantern probable victory in the 2011 Juvenile Fillies’ Turf. Hannon Jnr said: ‘You still need a fresh horse to beat the Americans in their own back yard and in Toronado we have just that. This has been the plan since Royal Ascot. Provided Hughesie can get him into a good early rhythm from what is a decent draw (in stall five), he ought to go very close.’ Toronado races to victory in the Queen Anne Stakes at Ascot earlier this year . Toast of New York is aiming to become the second European horse ever to win the Classic when it's run on dirt . In the absence of injured dual Mile winner Wise Dan and Toronado’s Sussex Stakes conqueror Kingman, Hannon’s hope, who is racing for only the fourth time this year, is 2-1 favourite with Coral. The field also includes David Simcock’s Woodbine Mile winner Trade Storm and Dermot Weld’s Jersey Stakes winner Mustajeeb plus Veda, Karakontie and Anodin from France. Jamie Osborne’s Toast Of New York attempts to become only the second European horse to win the $5m Classic when it has been run on dirt. But he is up against unbeaten Shared Belief, who comprehensively beat him in the Pacific Classic at Del Mar, and Kentucky Derby hero California Chrome.","Toronado goes to the Breeders' Cup Mile feeling fresh after a light campaign .

"Newmarket trainer Phil McEntee flies out to California this morning hoping filly Living The Life can make sure he lives the American dream. Europe, buoyed by last year’s success, launches one of its strongest ever numerical challenges for the Breeders’ Cup which gets under way at Santa Anita racecourse tonight. If Living The Life can land Saturday's $1million Filly & Mare Sprint, her success will be credited to US trainer Gary Mandella. But the four-year-old’s success will have its foundations firmly rooted in British All-Weather racing. Living The Life exercises in preparation for the Breeders' Cup Filly & Mare Sprint, which has $1m prize money . The filly was acquired by Phil McEntee for Hank Nothhaft and is trained by Gary Mandella . She looked a decent but relatively modest performer when acquired for US owner Hank Nothhaft by McEntee to inject some European blood into his North America operation. But before she shipped out to the States she emphatically lifted the £91,000 first prize in the Fillies’ & Mares’ Championships Conditions Stakes at the inaugural All-Weather Finals Day staged on Good Friday at Lingfield. McEntee, whose brother Carl is Nothhaft’s racing manager, said: ‘After we got her she started improving and after her second start for me I told Hank we should qualify her for this race.’ Since being sent across the Atlantic, Living The Life has won both her races, including a Group Two race at Presque Isle Downs. Both of those races were on synthetic surfaces similar to those she raced on in Britain. Tomorrow’s race will be her first on traditional US Dirt but McEntee is hopeful she can overcome that obstacle. McEntee added: ‘She has been at Santa Anita for the last seven weeks. Gary is very pleased with her. She has done a lot of work on the Dirt with her jockey Rafael Bejarano riding her and the vibes are positive. ‘The Filly & Mare Sprint is a funny race. It is over seven furlongs and all Living The Life’s wins in Britain have been over that distance. There are others in it who are six-furlong horses stepping up or milers dropping back.’ Living The Life’s is 10-1 shot and McEntee is hoping the galloping advert will bring him fresh US clients. McEntee revealed they are very positive about Living The Life's condition, saying she has been training well . Europe will be hoping for a bright start to the Breeders’ Cup on Friday night. The challenge for the Juvenile Turf is headed by Charlie Hills-trained Autumn Stakes winner Commemorative but Hugo Palmer has had to withdraw his Solario Stakes winner Aktabantay because the colt has a sore foot. Palmer said: ‘He worked and moved really well this morning and I was growing in confidence about his chances. Unfortunately, that confidence did not last long as he was found to have a sore foot when he returned back to the barn and I had to make the decision to scratch him.’ Aktabantay’s absence has created a slot in the line-up for Brian Meehan-trained Faithful Creek, who had been on stand-by as first reserve. He will be ridden by Kieren Fallon. Aidan O’Brien’s Qualify has the form to go close in the Juvenile Fillies’ Turf but from wide stall will need an inspired Ryan Moore ride to succeed. Richard Hannon’s Osaila (Frankie Dettori) is better placed in stall two. The organisers of the All Weather Championships could not wish for a better advert than Living the Life. It was day one of the second year of the programme at Lingfield yesterday when Charlie Appleby’s Tearless (Adam Kirby) landed the Listed Fleur De Lys Fillies’ Stakes, a Fast Track Qualifier to Good Friday Finals day. Innovations this year are qualifying races in Dubai, France and Ireland and a new three-year-old sprint category. Trainer Roger Varian landed his fifth Group One race of the season when Vert De Grece landed the Criterium International at Saint-Cloud under jockey Umberto Rispoli.","Breeders' Cup gets under way on Friday at Santa Anita .

The most valuable race is the finale $5m (£3.12m) Classic run on Dirt to be contested by Jamie Osborne’s Toast Of New York. 5 wins by European runners last year.

"Graham Bradley, one of the most controversial figures in British racing, has issued a plea to be allowed to pursue his aim of becoming a trainer after he and Brendan Powell were both cleared of a serious breach of the rules by a BHA disciplinary panel. The panel dismissed charges that Bradley, a registered employee of Lambourn trainer Powell, had been training horses and running them under Powell’s name. The pair, also accused of acting in a manner prejudicial to the integrity, proper conduct or good reputation of the sport, faced bans of up to three years. Graham Bradley wants his training application to be pushed through now he's been cleared by the BHA . Bradley’s application to become a trainer, lodged in May 2013, has been on hold pending the outcome of the case. The prospect of him returning to the sport in a frontline role will fill the BHA with alarm but they will now have to grasp the issue. Bradley, 54, remains a figure who sharply divides opinion. A jockey who could turn race-riding into an art form, his biggest wins included the 1983 Cheltenham Gold Cup on Bregawn and the 1996 Champion Hurdle on Collier Bay. Bradley’s application to become a trainer has been on hold pending the outcome of the case in which it was claimed he trained horses and ran them under the name of his employer Brendan Powell (pictured right) But the stain on the reputation of a man, who also has operated as a successful bloodstock agent, is the five-year ban slapped on him by the Jockey Club in 2002 for receiving money for tips from Brian Wright, a man subsequently sent to jail for 30 years after being exposed as one of Britain’s biggest drug dealers. Bradley at the latter end of his often decorated career as a jockey that included wins in the 1983 Cheltenham Gold Cup and 1996 Champion Hurdle . Bradley said: ‘Things happened a long, long time ago. I am a lot older and wiser now. I regret things I have done in the past but I have committed the crime and paid the penalty. ‘It is time to move on and let me re-build my life for my family. ‘I applied for a licence on May 28, 2013. I submitted a business plan and had a little yard. That yard has definitely gone but now this is out of the way I want to move on and look for another one. ‘I have been in racing a long time, it is my life. I was a very successful jockey and bloodstock agent. Now hopefully they will let me get on with trying to be a successful trainer.’ The case against Bradley and Powell was the first of its type ever pursued. Asked if he thought the BHA’s desire to keep him out of the sport had motivated the case, Bradley added: ‘They have a job to do and were acting on intelligence. ‘But myself and Brendan told them what we were doing which was just working very hard to secure both our futures. Thankfully, the panel has come to the right decision.’ The BHA said it was ‘disappointed’ by the Disciplinary Panel’s verdict, adding a decision on Bradley’s trainer’s licence application would not be made until it had had a chance to study the reasons for the decision. The BHA said it was ‘disappointed’ by the Disciplinary Panel’s verdict and will study the reasons for the verdict before they make a call on Bradley’s trainer’s licence application . Spokesman Robin Mounsey said: ‘It is too early to comment on how this process will now pan out but we will be in contact with Graham Bradley to discuss the status of his application in due course. The Disciplinary Panel’s reasons will be integral to the way in which this matter is taken forward.’ In August, the BHA lifted a 10-year ban on jockey Fergal Lynch riding in Britain which had been imposed after he admitted stopping Bond City from winning a race in August 2004.","BHA disciplinary panel dismissed charge that Graham Bradley had been training horses and running them under employer Brendan Powell’s name .

"Frankie Dettori landed his 11th Breeders’ Cup victory on Friday when winning the Juvenile Turf on Wesley Ward’s Hootenanny. The 6-1 shot was adding to his victory in the Windsor Castle Stakes at Royal Ascot in June. European hopes of a victory in the first race of the two-day Breeders’ Cup programme had been high with four runners, including well-backed Aidan O’ Brien-trained War Envoy, who faded into 12th of the 14 runners. Frankie Dettori holds his arms aloft in celebration after riding Hootenanny to victory on Friday . Dettori (right) claimed his 11th Breeders's Cup with victory in Friday's Juvenile Turf . Charlie Hills-trained Commemorative was seventh, Charlie Fellowes-trained Wet Sail last and the best they could muster was fifth from Brian Meehan’s fast-finishing Faithful Creek under Kieren Fallon. Dettori always had Coolmore Stud-owned Hootenanny well placed just behind front-running eventual second Luck Of the Kitten and he hauled that rival back with a strong run in the home stretch. It was a fourth Group One win of the year for Dettori, whose future looked bleak when he split with Sheik Mohammed’s Godolphin operation. He has, however, flourished under new boss Sheik Joaan and also formed an occasional and lucrative trans-atlantic link with Ward. The jockey said: ‘It’s the greatest comeback since Frank Sinatra.’ On his victory Dettori added: ‘There was a strong pace and I got him to switch off. He didn’t corner well and lost momentum on the bends but when he got to the stretch he flew.’ Hootenanny and Dettori ride clear of the field during the 2014 Breeders' Cup at Santa Anita Park on Friday . Trainer Ward was not at Santa Anita in California to witness his first Breeders’ Cup win having stayed in Florida to watch his son compete in a cross-country event. Hootenanny has made two trips to Europe this year having also finished second to the Dettori-ridden The Wow Signal in the Group One Prix Morny at Deauville. Asked if the colt could return to Europe to contest a Classic, Coolmore partner Michael Tabor said: ‘Why not, we are optimists.’ Dettori later finished third on Richard Hannon’s Osaila in the Juvenile Fillies Turf won by Lady Eli.

"The New Orleans Saints cracked open a scrappy game late in the first half to forge to a 28-10 win over the Carolina Panthers on Thursday, wrestling top spot in the NFC South from their opponents in the process. Running back Mark Ingram claimed two touchdowns and 100 yards in the win for New Orleans while quarterback Drew Brees added 297 yards passing and a touchdown. He also ran for a score. With both sides failing to fire offensively for the opening 26 minutes, two Saints touchdowns in the last three minutes of the first half produced the gap needed to secure the win over their divisional opponents. New Orleans Saints running back Mark Ingram celebrates after scoring a touchdown against the Panthers . New Orleans improved to 4-4 on the season, snapping a seven-game road losing streak, to push ahead of the 3-5-1 Panthers. After the Panthers had failed to get points out of two forced turnovers and the Saints had also squandered a chance after a Cam Newton interception the stalemate was broken after Junior Galette sacked Newton near his own endzone that allowed the Saints to set up Ingram for a three-yard touchdown run. Carolina Panthers cheerleaders perform in the second half as their team lost to the New Orleans Saints . With time running out in the first half Brees marched the Saints 85 yards, capped off by a Jimmy Graham one-yard reception touchdown with three seconds left in the first half for a 14-0 lead.

"Detroit Lions head coach Jim Caldwell paid tribute to a ‘special unit’ after his team came from 21-0 down to beat the Atlanta Falcons at Wembley on Sunday. Matt Prater kicked a game-winning field goal as time expired to send the Lions to 6-2 with victory in London, and Caldwell was delighted with the comeback. ‘They don’t quit,’ Caldwell said about his team at his post-game press conference.

Matt Prater (centre) kicks the winning field goal in the game's final moments as Detroit secured their win . Prater celebrates with his team-mates as his superb 48-yard conversion won the game at Wembley . ‘They are not deterred and they play with poise down the stretch. The pressure doesn’t bother them and they find a way to make plays. But they hang together so well and are always talking to each other on the sidelines. It’s a pretty special unit. ‘In the first half we didn’t play well and get the type of start we were looking for. In the second half, it was a bit more like the way we are capable of playing and in the end it worked out for us. ‘It was one of the games where I felt that if we could stop them, we had a chance to come back. To get from the six-yard line down to field-goal range at the end was a heck of a drive.’ The Lions head home from London into their bye week still sitting atop the NFC North. Caldwell thinks his team will be even better after their bye once the likes of Calvin Johnson and Reggie Bush return from injury. ‘It is a great time for the bye week,’ the Lions head coach said. ‘We have a chance to get some guys healthy for the second half of the season. Wembley was taken over by the NFL once again for Atalanta Falcons against Detriot Lions . Garrett Reynolds (left) and Dan Orlovsky (right) celebrate the Lions' win at the end of the match . ‘This week was great for us in terms of our preparation I don’t think it could have been any better. The hospitality has been superb and tremendous and it was a great experience. I think our guys enjoyed it.’ Lions quarterback Matt Stafford added: ‘It was a crazy way to end the game and I’m proud of our guys to fight tooth and nail and get the win. We pulled it together and had a fantastic final drive to get into field goal range. ‘In the first half we didn’t play as good as we can and we know that. The second half was more like the defense I have seen all year. They have a lot of pride and to shut out the Falcons in the second half was really impressive.’ Stafford’s 59-yard touchdown pass to Golden Tate sparked the Lions into life in the third quarter. That throw was Stafford’s 119th touchdown pass, surpassing Bobby Layne’s previous Lions franchise record of 118. He said: ‘Hopefully it is not my last touchdown pass for the Lions and there will be more to come, but it is something pretty special.’ Matt Stafford (right) sparked the comeback from the Lions with a 59-yard touchdown pass .

Tate also praised the character of the Lions. ‘This team has a lot of heart and it’s incredible to see and be a part of,’ the former Seattle wide receiver said. ‘It’s exciting to be a part of something like this and we are excited for the second half of the season.’ On the 59-yard touchdown reception, Tate added: ‘It was a great play by Matt (Stafford) getting out of the pocket, extending the play and making something happen. ‘They had a great coverage, but I guess the safety got caught flat-footed when he saw Matt about the throw the ball and I jogged past him. Having the arm that he has, Matt can make any throw. I was worried about dropping it because the ball came on to me so quickly.’","Matt Prater kicked game-winning field goal to hand Lions victory 22-21 .

"Detroit Lions defensive end Ziggy Ansah took a cab journey from the team’s Bagshot base all the way to north London on Tuesday to reunite with his older sister after six years apart. The Ghanaian-born defensive star turned up unannounced at his older sibling’s doorstep and overwhelmed his sister, Elizabeth Giddings. Ansah had planned to meet up with his sister later in the week, but instead spent five or six hours with her on Tuesday — the day the Lions landed in the UK for their game against Atlanta Falcons at Wembley on Sunday. Ziggy Ansah hopped in a taxi to north London to meet his sister for the first time in six years . Ansah stops New Orleans Saints quarterback Drew Brees, and will hope for similar against Falcons' Matt Ryan . ‘I didn’t tell her I was coming actually,’ Ansah said at Detroit’s Pennyhill Park headquarters on Thursday. ‘I know her address, took a cab, went to her house and knocked on the door. She just fell on the floor and was overwhelmed.’ ‘We do talk, but we haven’t seen each other for a while. We just talked, she cooked some African food for me which was great.’ Giddings is one of Ansah’s four siblings (the other three live in Ghana), and is seven years older than the defensive end. She also has two children, making Ansah an uncle. He said: ‘Her little boy is just in love with me. He told me to get him a Halloween costume, so I got him a Spiderman costume and he wore it the whole time.’","Ansah took a cab from Bagshot to north London to make the reunion .

"Atlanta Falcons head coach Mike Smith feels his team have prepared well for Sunday’s International Series game against the Detroit Lions, but one man is still playing on his mind. Lions wide receiver Calvin Johnson is still an injury doubt for the game, and coach Smith knows the importance of being prepared if ‘Megatron’ plays at Wembley. Johnson trained for Detroit for the third straight day on Friday at their Bagshot base, and Smith is ready to change his game plan at the last minute if need be. The Atlanta Falcons trained at Arsenal's London Colney complex on Friday ahead of Sunday's clash . The Falcons face the Detroit Lions at Wembley and were put through their paces at Arsenal's training ground . Calvin Johnson is recovering from an ankle injury but has trained twice since arriving in England . ‘If Calvin plays then you have to know where he is and you have to have a different game plan,’ Smith said after Atlanta’s practice on Friday. ‘You have to know where Calvin is going to line up and put more resources to stop him because he is one of the most dangerous wide receivers in football.’ The Falcons have practiced at Arsenal’s London Colney training base all week, and Smith is pleased with how things went for his team. ‘The facilities here are fantastic,’ the Falcons coach said. ‘It was a really good week of preparation. Arsenal have been very accommodating to let us use their facilities and been great hosts. Ryan Schraeder goes in goal for the Falcons as they temporarily swapped football for soccer on Friday .

We will then head into town and spend some time with the fans at the Fan Rally in Trafalgar Square. ‘We are looking forward to seeing the crowds, and then we’ll check into our hotel across the road from Wembley Stadium and have meetings on Saturday night.’ The Falcons head into Sunday’s game with a 2-5 record and occupying third place in the NFC South behind the Carolina Panthers (3-3-1) and New Orleans Saints (2-4). Smith said Johnson, the Detroit Lions wide receiver, was one of the most dangerous in football . ‘It’s our most important game because it’s our next one,’ Smith said. ‘We are right in the thick of a tough divisional race and it is going to be very important for us to go out and play efficiently. Wide receiver Roddy White added: ‘Every game is a must win. We are one game away from first place in our division. If we can go out on Sunday and get something going to get us a win, then it will be a positive and we can roll into the bye week and go from there. ‘Practice has been really good and we’ve been really focused the last few days. It has been really smooth for us and we’ve made a good transition. We expect to play well on Sunday.’ Falcons head coach Smith revealed that if Johnson plays they will have to change their game plan .","Atlanta Falcons will face Detroit Lions at Wembley on Sunday .

"Detroit Lions' star wide receiver Calvin Johnson is slowly returning to full fitness ahead of Sunday’s game against Atlanta Falcons, but still has a long way to go before being passed fit for the Wembley showpiece. Johnson has been watching from the sidelines since injuring his ankle during Detroit’s week-five defeat by Buffalo Bills, but travelled with the team to England on Tuesday with a view to making a comeback against the Falcons. Detroit wide receiver Calvin Johnson runs with a ball during a training session on Thursday . ‘He was limited (in practice on Wednesday),’ head coach Jim Caldwell said at the team’s Pennyhill Park base on Thursday. ‘He did what the doctors allowed him to do. Typically, when they ramp up their activity that way, the most important thing is how they feel the next day. ‘Today he came back feeling good and that’s encouraging.’ Johnson did not suffer any adverse reaction after being put through his paces in two practice sessions . Johnson practised again on Thursday at Lions HQ in Bagshot, and looked to be moving more freely. Before practice, Johnson said: ‘We are moving in a positive direction. Right now it is getting better on a daily basis. ‘We are doing everything from straightforward running to moving laterally as well and things are going good.’ Johnson still hopes to step out in front of 84,000 fans at Wembley Stadium on Sunday . The 29-year-old is prepared to wait until Sunday before being given the all clear to play in front of 84,000 fans at Wembley in the latest International Series fixture. ‘It might go all the way to Sunday,’ he said. ‘I want to push it, but we’re trying to be smart about it and taking good advice from our training staff.’","Calvin Johnson injured his ankle during Detroit's defeat by Buffalo Bills .

"Jarryd Hayne will successfully realise his dream of playing in the National Football League – at least that’s what Super Bowl-winner Reggie Bush believes. The Detroit Lions running back, who is preparing for Sunday's game at Wembley against the Atlanta Falcons, was asked about the prospect of his club signing the 26-year-old Australian. Bush, 29, met Hayne while he was visiting Australia and watched him play in the State of Origin. He describes the fullback as a ‘good athlete’. Reggie Bush, who landed in England with the Lions on Tuesday, spoke highly of Jarryd Hayne . 'I have not had a chance to speak to him recently, but when I did when I was in Australia. I spoke with him quite a bit about playing in the NFL and he seemed very excited about the opportunity.' The former University of Southern California Trojan, who previously dated Kim Kardashian, said he spoke to Hayne about switching sports: . 'I just told him: ""If you really want to do this than you should definitely go for it"". I just talked about, I’ll give an example of when I was in New Orleans, there was an opportunity for me to either stay in New Orleans or get traded to Miami and I took that opportunity, that leap of faith to go to a different team and prove that I could be an every down back. I told him the same thing for him, ‘If you feel like you’ll never forgive yourself for not taking this opportunity than you should definitely go.' Asked if he talked to any team-mate about Hayne, Bush continued: 'I spoke to Joique (Bell) about him and some of the running backs about him. We actually watched some of his highlight films and he’s a really good player. I got a chance to watch him play in Australia against the State of Origin. It was really exciting. Like I said, he’s a great player, he’s fast, he’s big, he’s strong and has everything it takes to play in this league.' Jaryd Hayne hopes to swap the NRL for the NFL . Hayne, who announced he was leaving the NRL during a tearful press conference and flew to Los Angeles on Sunday night, already is rumoured to have at least six teams interested in his services. The Lions, who have previously employed Norwegian placekicker Havard ‘Kickalicious’ Rugland, are believed to be one of the teams considering making a bid for Hayne. Team president Tom Lewand was non-commital about the Australian, saying: 'We look at a lot of players and I’ll let Martin (Mayhew) comment on more specifics, but we’ll look at a lot of different guys in a lot of different areas. We’re always looking to make the team better.' When he was asked earlier this week about the prospect of his team signing the former Parramatta Eel, Detroit head coach Jim Caldwell said: ‘I can’t tell you much about that. I mean, I know who he is, obviously, but I don’t know what I’m supposed to tell you. I have no knowledge of it in that regard.’ The Lions (5-2) have had issues at running back this year as Bush and backups Joique Bell and Theo Riddick have all missed time with injuries, so Caldwell said it was possible Detroit’s front office was looking at Hayne. ‘It could be a personnel issue, but I’m not aware of it. Besides that, our focus is pretty narrow this time of the year, so getting out of that realm, it’s hard to do. But it could happen. Obviously, there are a lot of good athletes around this country, and there are a bunch of them playing other sports, you know, basketball, baseball, rugby, which is similar to our sport, and there is a lot of carryover. So, we’ll see’ The reigning Super Bowl champion Seattle Seahawks have been linked to Hayne, as have the Los Angeles Kiss of the Arena Football League. Rockers Gene Simmons and Paul Stanley of the legendary group of the same name are owners of the Kiss. If Hayne avoids Kiss and the AFL and is able to make it in Detroit Rock City, it won’t be because Bush has spoken to team management on his behalf - at least not yet. ‘I didn't say anything directly to them about him, but I spoke to some of my team-mates about him and just showed them some of his highlights,’ Bush said. ‘He's a great athlete and I told him I definitely think he has a future in the NFL if he's serious about it.’ Just because Bush has kept mum about Hayne doesn’t mean the Lions potential interest in the Aussie import has gone unnoticed. A Michigan construction company posted a Facebook poll on Wednesday morning asking if Lions fans would want the team to sign Hayne, suspended running back Ray Rice or simply stand pat. It drew a number of responses, although many of them were bashing former Baltimore Raven and admitted domestic abuser Rice. The story of Hayne making it in the NFL would be a much more positive one, especially because other rugby players have been somewhat unsuccessful in the past. Australian Hayden Smith, now of a member of Saracens FC caught a single pass in five games with the New York Jets as a tight end in 2012. American Carlin Isles, formerly of the Glasgow Warriors, previously attempted to make the Lions but was cut earlier this year.","Detroit Lions running back says ex-National Rugby League star possesses 'all the skill sets'

"Jim Caldwell, the genial quinquagenarian who quotes George S Patton in press conferences, has a calm demeanour which is rubbing off on the Detroit Lions. Previously an ill-disciplined bunch seemingly capable of spectacular implosions, the Lions lead the NFC North and ooze confidence on and off the field. Turnovers and penalties are down, and while they previously relied upon their offense to win games, it is when they do not have the ball that they are the most dangerous. Teryl Austin has a fully functioning defense at his disposal. It features a fearsome front four, a linebacker capable of dominating the run in DeAndre Levy, while Glover Quin, Rashean Mathis and Darius Slay have made a mockery of pre-season fears about the secondary. Jim Caldwell's reign has started in favourable fashion with the perennial underachievers looking to reach the playoffs for the first time since 2011 . In the past, the Lions have struggled to overcome injuries. And there have been some bizarre ones this season. Linebacker Stephen Tulloch is out for the season after tearing his ACL celebrating a sack on Aaron Rodgers. He played the previous 131 games. Meanwhile, tight end Joseph Fauria is still sidelined after injuring his ankle while trying to stop his dog urinating in his house. And that's without mention of Calvin Johnson. The Lions have recorded back-to-back wins as the All-Pro receiver struggles with an ankle injury. Calvin Johnson returned to practice on Wednesday . But Caldwell's next man up policy seems to be creating a different breed of Lions. Sunday saw a remarkable 13-point comeback in the final four minutes to win against the Saints. The gutsy win was exactly the sort of perfomance which would have eluded combustible former coach Jim Schwartz. And while Schwartz, now Buffalo's defensive co-ordinator, temporarily got one over his old team with his bizarre post-game celebration  in week five, the Lions are a Wembley win away from going 6-2 into the bye. The team have sung Caldwell's praises all season. From president Tom Lewand to media personnel, no-one has a bad word to say about him. They say his calm nature and logical methods have spread through the organisation. 'He’s exactly what I hoped and expected he would be during the interview process, if not better,' Lewand said ahead of the Lions' first practice session on English soil. Asked to summarise success this season, defensive end Jason Jones added: 'Maybe it was just the change with the coaching staff. Coach Caldwell has brought in a different message over to us. He treats us like men and professionals. That’s how we’ll carry our business.' Caldwell  commands and emits respect. When he talks, people listen. And when he divulged the secrets to his leadership, the answer was typically straightforward. 'I simply treat them as men, hold them accountable for what they do and try to take care of them. 'I know at one point in time I was reading an old military magazine or one of the military manuals that Patton had put together and in it, one of the things he said was: ""Take care of your men"". And that stuck out to me. Golden Tate, a free agency acquisition, has shown the Lions that they can cope without Calvin Johnson . 'Even as a young coach, I was probably in my twenties at that time and I wrote it down and I felt that was something that was extremely important because I could sense it and see why it was important in the profession in the profession of which I was in. 'And I’ve always felt that to be the case, that you have to try to  give them the best opportunity to be the absolute best they can. So, it’s our duty to have empathy along with expertise and I think that’s really what coaching is all about. And I think that’s probably what they’re responding to, but it’s really more about them than me.' A typically modest response from the man who may just be turning the tide in Detroit.","The Lions are historically a tortured franchise with an uncanny ability to shoot themselves in the foot .

"Atlanta quarterback Matt Ryan knows the losing must stop for the Falcons, and it must stop this weekend at Wembley against Detroit. The Falcons travelled to London for their International Series game against the Lions on the back of four straight defeats and carrying a 2-5 record. Standing in their way of a first victory for over a month on Sunday afternoon at Wembley will be the Detroit Lions, who sit pretty atop the NFC North with a 5-2 record and boast the best defense in the league. Matt Ryan ponders a question as the Falcons look to buck a four-game losing streak against the Lions . The Falcons are the 'home' team, but have won just once away from the Gerogia Dome in the past two seasons . ‘Detroit is very good defensively and statistically near the top of the league in all categories,’ Ryan said at the team’s Grove Hotel base on Wednesday. ‘They have even had some injuries at the linebacker position but replaced some of their starters with good players. They have also got some of the premier defensive linemen in the league. ‘We are going to have to be solid up front and have good plans to account for where those guys are at and that's what we're working on. We are at a point on the season where we are going to have to win. I feel like we are going to have to start winning this week.’ Atlanta got down to business on Wednesday as they practiced for the first time this week at Arsenal’s Colney training headquarters ahead of their clash with the Lions. Ryan is grateful for the opportunity to make use of a Premier League team’s facilities, and intends on watching a game in England at some point. ‘I have never been to a football game over here,’ the Atlanta quarterback said. ‘It's on the bucket list to do at some point. I first started watching football when I was in college because I started playing the game FIFA on Xbox and AC Milan was my team. ‘I'm a fan and like watching any sport when it is at the highest level. I watched Manchester United play the other night (against West Brom) and it was a really exciting game. Arsenal are very nice to let us go over there (to Colney) and make use of their space.’ Ryan has 2,078 passing yards to his name, but the Falcons are struggling again after a 4-12 season last season . The Falcons face a must-win game at Wembley with their season at a critical point . The injury-hit Falcons made the 4,200-mile trip to London on Monday, leaving themselves six whole days to acclimate to the new surroundings, foreign country and time difference. ‘The most difficult part is probably the first two days and getting acclimated to the time difference,’ Ryan said. ‘We are now into our normal routine of what we do during the week. Guys have settled in and are really excited about the change of venue and to play in front of what we hear is a great crowd.’ Wide receiver Julio Jones, meanwhile, has taken a little longer than Ryan to settle into London life. ‘I haven't adjusted yet,’ Jones laughed. ‘I'm still hurting. ‘We went downtown the other day in a cab and walked around. It was expensive. It cost £70 or £80, but it helps when you're with a couple of guys who have money.’ Wide receiver Julio Jones ventured into London with team-mates and looked at the sights . Head coach Mike Smith says the Falcons are not out of contention in the NFC South . Head coach Mike Smith is happy with the way his team has adjusted to the foreign surroundings since touching down at Gatwick Airport at the beginning of the week. ‘The adjustment and the time change has been the biggest challenge,’ he said. ‘Once we arrived here our logistics people did a great job and we have been able to do everything like we would do it back home. It's been good so far.’ Despite Atlanta struggling at 2-5, they only trail NFC South leaders the Carolina Panthers by less than two wins. Smith said: ‘We are right in the thick of the divisional race. It is going to be critical for us to get a win this week and stay in the race. It is very bunched and going to go down to the wire. ‘We have got to play better football than we have in the last four weeks. We have unfortunately had some injuries on our offensive line, but this is part of the NFL and you have to deal with it.’ And that offensive line will have to find a way of dealing with the Detroit’s dominant defense on Sunday.","The Falcons are 2-5 after a disappointing, injury-hit start to the season .

"Things are going pretty good in Detroit right now. They have won five out of seven and sit top of the NFC North ahead of their showdown with Atlanta at Wembley on Sunday. And all that despite scoring just 20 points per game, which makes them the 25th best offense in the league. 'It's a work in progress,' quarterback Matt Stafford said at the team's base in Bagshot on Thursday. 'But we're trying to get better every week. Detroit quarterback Matt Stafford winds up a pass at the team's training base in Bagshot on Thursday . The Detroit Lions will be without star wide receiver Calvin Johnson for Sunday's game at Wembley . 'Every time you get a group of 53 together year after year it's different. We have a new coaching staff implementing some of their stuff as well. I would say that there's a different culture and I think we're better for it.' Detroit's strong start has been largely down to their dominant defense, led by their Ndamukong Suh up front. The Lions defense is giving up the fewest yards per game (290.3) and their 15 points conceded per game is bettered only by the Ravens (14.9). Detroit's strong start has been largely down to their dominant defense, led by Ndamukong Suh up front . 'It's been fantastic,' Stafford acknowledged. 'They've gone up against some pretty tough offenses and faired really well. You see it every day in practice and you see it every day in the meetings. Their preparation is fantastic, we've got smart players, guys who have bought into a system and are playing extremely hard. 'When you get that, you know you're going to be successful. It starts from the coaching staff on down, but every one of those guys on defense is playing fantastic.' The bottom line is the Lions are finding a way to win. That's despite having to deal with a number of injuries, most notably star wide receiver Calvin Johnson, and a new head coach and offensive coordinator. Atlanta Falcons head coach Mike Smith has developed one of the toughest defensive systems in the NFL . Atlanta Falcons quarterback Matt Ryan gets ready to fire out a pass during a training session in London . 'You're not going to play your best football every week,' Stafford said. 'You strive for it, you strive for perfection, but it just flat out doesn't happen. You have to find ways to win games and more often than not, we've been able to do that this year. 'It's testament to our team, our character, our coaching staff, everybody is all in on trying to find a way to win and get better as we do it. 'One of the beauties of this offense is you can kind of mould it around whoever is available. We found that out early in this season with multiple injuries and guys missing time in certain spots.' Up against Stafford and Co this week is an Atlanta Falcons defense currently conceding 28.4 points per game – only St Louis (29.3) and Tampa Bay (34) are giving up more. On the Falcons defense, Stafford said: 'They've had some key injuries in some spots so if you watch tape from earlier in the year it looks a little bit different from now. Their defensive coordinator (Mike Nolan) has been a really good defensive coordinator for a long time in this league. 'He's still got them playing some complicated schemes. It's tough to deal with, so mentality and physically we'll have our work cut out for us.' Stafford also shrugged off suggestions that he has been holding back from throwing the ball deep and becoming a 'game manager'. 'I don't feel like I'm holding back,' the Lions quarterback said. 'I think defenses are doing a good job of trying to take that kind of stuff away. We've seen like we do every year quite a bit of split safety and deep coverage so I'm just trying to take what's there. 'I'm just trying to play the best football I can play. I've never really got in too much with labels. As to what type of quarterback I am, I just try to play each individual game as well as I can, do what I'm asked to do, and win them.'","Detroit have won five out of seven games and sit top of the NFC North .

Taveras was a teenager when he signed with St. Louis as an international free agent in 2008. Before this season, he was ranked as the No. 3 overall prospect by MLB.com and Baseball America. He homered against the Giants' Yusmeiro Petit in his major league debut May 31 and had a big solo drive in the seventh inning of Game 2 in the NL Championship Series against San Francisco. 'This is a huge loss for us and the Dominican Republic,' Matheny said. 'He was our weapon off the bench and we had plans for him next year. Even though he was only 22, he wasn't afraid of anything. He had a great heart, and this is a tragedy for us.' Taveras of the St Louis Cardinals warms up during batting practice exactly two weeks before his death on Sunday .

"Charlotte Hornets forward Jeffery Taylor pleaded guilty on Wednesday to misdemeanor domestic assault in connection with his arrest in September at a Michigan hotel, a county prosecutor’s office said. Under a deal with prosecutors, Taylor, 25, also pleaded guilty in an East Lansing, Michigan, courtroom to misdemeanor malicious destruction of property. A charge of assault and battery was dropped, prosecutors said. Taylor was taken into custody at an East Lansing hotel early on September 25, police said at the time. They did not release details of the incident. Jeffery Taylor, pictured playing for the Charlotte Hornets, has pleaded guilty to misdemeanor domestic assault . Taylor, pictured with LeBron James, could be placed in a probation diversion programme . The misdemeanors carry up to 93 days in jail, but the Ingham County prosecutor said it would not object to Judge Andrea Larkin ordering Taylor placed in a probation diversion programme. The domestic assault charge could be stricken from Taylor’s record if he completes his probation. A representative of the Charlotte Hornets could not be reached immediately for comment. A flurry of cases, most notably those of National Football League running backs Adrian Peterson and Ray Rice, has put a spotlight on athletes accused of domestic abuse and how sports leagues respond to such allegations and incidents. Taylor’s second season in the National Basketball Association was cut short last year when he ruptured his Achilles tendon 26 games into the season.

"Calvin Johnson practised today in Bagshot . The sight of Calvin Johnson on the practice field is a welcome one to Detroit Lions fans hoping to see the wide receiver at Wembley. While the All-Pro  did not take part in the open session at Pennyhill Park, the team’s official injury report listed him as a limited participant. It is the first time in three weeks that Johnson has taken part in practice since spraining his right ankle in the defeat to Buffalo in week five. In his absense, the Lions clinched back-to-back wins with victories against the Vikings and the Saints. ‘Feeling good,’ Johnson said when asked about his fitness on Tuesday. ‘Had a good flight. Most of the guys were sleeping on the way over here, so we're just waking up. But I feel good right now.’ He is set to speak to the media tomorrow morning. Three tight ends were also absent from the Lions’ first training session in England, with Eric Ebron, Brandon Pettigrew and Joseph Fauria joining defensive end Ziggy Ansah and right tackle LaAdrian Waddle on the sidelines. ‘Obviously, it goes day-to-day with these guys, and both of them are rapidly improving,' Caldwell said of Ebron and Fauria. ‘And I have to sort of wait and see what happens, where the doctors say where they are before we can utilise them. So at this point in time, it's kind of a day-to-day thing, and we'll see how it goes.’ Jim Caldwell was in relaxed mood during his press conference and will hope to take the Lions to 6-2 . Meanwhile, running back William Powell was released by the Lions, just two days after landing in England. Rookie safety Jerome Couplin was signed to the practice squad in his place. ‘It’s a difficult thing to do, and you certainly don’t want to do it. A guy just gets here, and within 48 hours he’s heading back home, but that’s kind of the nature of our business. ‘The guys understand it, and I think if you’re up front and tell him exactly why, what the reasons are, it’s a bitter pill to swallow but they understand,’ Caldwell explained.","Johnson has been absent with after sustaining an injury to his right ankle in week five .

"Ricky Walden continued his love affair with China as he won the International Championship in Chengdu, beating Mark Allen 10-7 in the final. It was the Chester player's third ranking title, all in China after winning the 2008 Shanghai Masters and 2012 Wuxi Classic. It capped a fine week for Walden, who hammered Robert Milkins 9-2 in his semi-final after previous wins over Lyu Chenwei, David Morris, Zhou Yuelong and giant-killers Joe Swail and Jamie Burnett, who had beaten Neil Robertson and Judd Trump respectively. Ricky Walden claimed the International Championship in Chengdu after storming to the final . Breaks of 59 and 64 helped him into a 3-1 lead at the interval in the first session but Allen levelled after a 113 break in frame six. The next four were shared, Allen with a 52 in frame nine, and though Walden moved two clear with the help of an 85 break in frame 12 Allen responded with 68 and 74 to leave the match poised at 7-7. The Englishman found another gear, though, with an 85 in frame 15 followed by a 103 to move within one frame of victory. And he clinched the frame in two visits, a 54 putting him on top before a 62 saw him capture the £125,000 first prize. Runner-up Allen collected £65,000 towards his world ranking. Walden said: 'I couldn't be happier. It was a tough first session today, and then I got better in the second session. 'It's a dream come true to win this event. All three of my titles have come in China and I love playing here.' He told worldsnooker.com: 'I've not thought about the money. It was just so important for me to get my hands on the trophy. The money is just a bonus. My wife will find a good place for it.' For Allen, who overcame Mark Williams 9-8 in a thrilling semi-final, it was a third defeat in four ranking finals this season. He won the Paul Hunter Classic in Furth but was beaten at the Riga Open and Shanghai Masters. He said: 'I didn't come here to finish second. I'll probably look back in a few months' time and think I've had a great start to the season but I've lost three out of four finals and that's not good enough. It's something I have to work on. 'I need to go back to the practice table and keep working. I'm obviously doing the right things as I have got to four finals. I just need to turn them into victories.'","Ricky Walden claims title after defeating Mark Allen 10-7 in the final .

"Sean Dyche celebrates two years in charge of a Burnley side dented but not broken by their winless start to life back in the Barclays Premier League. The Clarets boss, who took over on October 30, 2012 with the side 13th in the Championship, needs no reminding that Burnley are the only club in the top four tiers of English football without a victory. Breaking that sequence does not get any easier, with a trip to the Emirates to face Arsenal to come on Saturday. Sean Dyche's said his side are using criticism as a motivation, Burnley are yet to win in the league this season . Burnley are already being talked about in the context of worst ever Premier League seasons. No team has ever failed to win a game during a campaign, although Derby only managed one in 2007-08, while QPR went 16 games without a victory at the start of the 2012-13 season. Not that Dyche is concerned by what has gone before, and he is not shying away from the reality of the situation. 'Whether it hurts or not is irrelevant,' he said. 'The fact is it's a fact. What it does is gives you the added motivation to get wins. 'The only thing I ever guaranteed when I came here was that I'd have a group of motivated people giving everything they can, and that's exactly what we've still got. Burnley have endured a torrid start to the season, and lost 3-1 to Everton in their last outing . 'Now we've got to give even more, because that's what you've got to do to win matches in the Premier League. 'I'm used to winning and this group's used to winning, so that's been something we have to get our head around and allow the players the freedom to play to move forward. 'I've been down this road before. I've had a spell here when we didn't win games, I've been at Watford when we didn't win games. 'It's very rare that managers have it comfortable for year after year. Even Arsene Wenger was questioned after the first game last season. 'I'm learning plenty from it, that's for sure. It affects me in that my instinct is to win, and it has been since I was a little kid. That's the bit that dents you, but it doesn't break you. Burnley will face Arsenal at the Emirates Stadium on Saturday,Theo Walcott could make his return from injury . 'It's not about proving anyone wrong, it's about proving ourselves right.' Just as Dyche does not subscribe to the doom-laden predictions for his club, he also does not read anything into those criticising Arsenal's start to the season. The Gunners have won only once at home in the league, on the opening day against Crystal Palace, and needed a late goal to draw with Hull two weeks ago. 'We really look at ourselves,' said Dyche, whose side held Manchester United to a draw at Turf Moor in August. 'It's another fantastic challenge, particularly away from home. Arsenal have changed massively over the years to what they are now from when I was playing, they're a completely different animal and recognised in a worldwide market. 'We've had some huge clubs already, mainly at home, and this is one of the super powers away from home.'","Burnley travel to the Emirates Stadium to face Arsenal on Saturday .

Marney has trained all week and could go straight back into the side but the game again comes too soon for Steven Reid, who has only just returned to training after a groin problem. Midfielder Matt Taylor's Achilles operation was a success but no date has yet been set for a possible return while striker Sam Vokes is still working his way back from a serious knee injury.

Dean Marney could return to Burnley's starting lineup against Arsenal following a hamstring problem . Key match stats (supplied by Opta) Arsenal have been behind at some point in each of their four Premier League home games this season. Burnley were the first lower league team ever to beat an Arsene Wenger Arsenal team in a cup competition when they won 2-0 in the 2008-09 League Cup. Arsenal have won their last three home matches in all competitions against the Clarets. Burnley have conceded 12 goals in their last four games in the  Premier League – this after previously keeping three clean sheets in a row. Arsene Wenger’s side are unbeaten in their last 22 home Premier League matches, winning 14 and drawing eight. Theo Walcott could make his first appearance of the season against Burnley, having scored against the Clarets when the teams last met in the Premier League  in a 3-1 home win for Arsenal in March 2010 . However, they have kept just two clean sheets in their last 10 PL games at the Emirates. Theo Walcott is the only player to score in the two 2009/10 Premier League meetings between these sides to still be at either club. Just 16.5 per cent of Burnley’s attempts on goal this season have been fashioned from set piece situations, a Premier League low. Burnley are the 12th side to fail to win any of their opening nine Premier League matches of a single season - seven of the previous 11 sides were relegated. Just nine teams have previously failed to win any of their opening 10 games in a Premier League season – the last occasions being Reading and QPR in 2012-13. Jason Shackell is the first Premier League player to make over 100 clearances this season (101).","Jack Wilshere likely to miss Burnley clash because of a knee injury .
