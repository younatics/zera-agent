"They are ranked No 1 and  in the world and the last two winners of the DP World Tour Championship. Now Henrik Stenson and Rory McIlroy are set to give the finest season in the history of European golf a fitting send-off with a heavyweight clash over the weekend. Day two honours at this year’s edition of the tour’s final event went to defending champion Stenson, who shot a 66 to lead by two shots from McIlroy, who carded a 70, with Scot Richie Ramsay (69) and in-form Danny Willett (67) from England on the same mark. ‘Henrik is very comfortable around this course, and I certainly cannot afford to let him get any further ahead,’ said McIlroy. Rory McIlroy struggled to replicate his first round form but still shot a two-under par round of 70 . Henrik Stenson shot a six-under par round of 66 to seize the lead by two shots after round two . As for his own round, the Northern Irishman commented:’It was certainly not as good as on Thursday (he shot 66) and that can happen when you haven’t played for a while. But I like my position going into the weekend.’ It’s not only Ramsay and Willett who will be hoping this doesn’t develop into a two-man race to rival the one going on an hour from here on the F1 circuit at Abu Dhabi. Irishman Shane Lowry, helped considerably by a hole in one at the 13th – he hit a seven iron - is only three behind after a 71 and then there’s Justin Rose. At four over par for his first ten holes on Thursday, the idea that he could be in a good position to win was fanciful. The Englishman, however, has shown the pride of a major champion in the 26 holes that have followed to play them in 11 under par and move from dead last to just three adrift. ‘It’s not the first time I’ve made a slow start to a tournament and maybe it’s something I need to look at,’ conceded Rose. ‘I was even four over par early on when I came back to win the US Open. Here there wasn’t a lot of positivity going on walking down the 11th hole after a long season, to be honest, but I probably relaxed and that’s when you often play your best golf.’ McIlroy walks alongside fellow overnight leader Shane Lowry (second right) during round two . Stenson (right) stands alongside his caddie on the 18th green during the second round of the tournament . Rose finished second here to McIlroy two years ago when he shot a wondrous 62 on the final day, only to come up short as the Northern Irishman concluded with five straight birdies. With a number of tees moved up, scoring was suitably low on day two. Spaniard Rafael Cabrera-Bello began with five straight birdies on his way to a 64 to join Rose on seven under. Luke Donald and Ian Poulter rebounded from poor first rounds with scores of 66 and 69 respectively. Rose came to the 18th with seven birdies on his card and an obvious opportunity to make it eight on this par five. The tee had been moved up 90 yards to bring it easily within range of two blows but Rose was caught out, and hit his drive flush into the creek that winds its way menacingly down the hole. Lowry (left) plays his third shot on the par five 18th and is tied fifth after round two in Dubai . ‘I played beautifully to that point and that’s the only shot I’d certainly want back,’ he said. ‘To be honest, when I hit it I thought it was going to be perfect and I was surprised to see it finish in the hazard.’ Asked how he would sum up a year in which he has won on both sides of the Atlantic, was a star at the Ryder Cup, but has fallen from fourth to seventh in the world, Rose replied:’I’d give it a B- or maybe a B because of the Ryder Cup. The thing that has been missing is that I played some good golf in the majors but was never able to do it for four rounds.’ Now he goes in search of the win that, given the calibre of the players ahead of him, might even cause the campaign to be upgraded to a B plus should he pull it off.","Rory McIlroy cards a second round of 70 to trail leader Henrik Stenson .

"Manny Pacquiao used to come to Macau often. Not to fight but to play the tables in the casinos which rake in more revenue than their namesakes in Las Vegas. That was before he found politics, basketball and, most importantly, God. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Manny Pacquiao trains in Macau ahead of Chris Algieri bout . Manny Pacquiao and Chris Algieri gear up for battle in Macau in front of the glare of the world's media . Pacquiao looked in relaxed mood ahead of his 63rd fight, while Algieri looks on . Pacquiao said he is fully focused on beating his American opponent on Saturday . The only boxer ever to win world titles in eight weight divisions recalls: ‘Back when I loved to gamble I was here a lot.’ This week the PacMan is here to fight Chris Algieri. The American matinee idol is five years younger, five inches taller, undefeated and a world light-welter champion in his own right. Not only is Pacquiao’s world welterweight title at stake in this catch-weight contest but the hope of tempting Floyd Mayweather into a potential billion dollar fight next year. The 35-year-old Filipino revealed he felt as fit as he did in the early stages of his career . So could this be a bigger gamble than any wager he laid in his partly miss-spent youth? Not really, it seems. Pacquiao never prepared for those 90 minute trips from Manilla. He just came to have fun. This time he has done the road work, the thousand sit-ups a day, the hundreds of rounds of sparring against up-and-coming title contenders and he says: ‘There is no pressure because of what could happen with Floyd. I am fully focussed on Algieri. I will be completely in the zone when we are in the ring. ‘I’m back to how I felt a few years ago. Fit, fast, strong. I’m not taking Chris lightly. I’m not looking past him. Only God predict what will happen but I am confident in myself.’ Born a Catholic, Pacquiao turned back to religion when his wild lifestyle jeopardised his family life with his wife and five children. Pacquiao throws a right-handed punch at Timothy Bradley during their fight earlier this year . He has never shied away from the topic and says: ‘I’m a friendly personality and always been very open about my life. I like to be among friends and to share the word of God with people.’ With his redemption secure, he feels the power returning to his fists, adding: ‘I have worked to bring back the early days, those when I was at my best and finished fights early.’ At 35, he says he feels 26 again. There was talk of distraction when, as a Philippines congressman, he announced his intention to run for his country’s senate. Then, as a 5ft 5in boxer, he took over a basketball team and became not only the shortest but the oldest rookie to take to the professional court. The light welterweight champion recently took time off from training to play in his first basketball game . But trainer Freddie Roach affirms: ‘We negotiated an agreement. I know Manny needs to be busy in many areas so we gave him a pass for one basketball game and then he commited to training for this fight the way he used to in what people regard as his prime. Now he’s as ready as he’s ever been.’ If they are right, this is bad news for Algieri. Not that he appears unnerved. He displays not an ounce of doubt that he can pull off one of the prize-ring’s major upsets. Nor, perhaps, should he after winning his title by climbing off the canvas twice in the first round against renowned puncher Ruslan Provodnikov to claim a hard-fought 12-round decision. Pacquiao is the only boxer in history to be a world champion in eight different weight divisions . Algieri is a likeable, persuasive talker who says: ‘Manny is one of the greats but I have the skills to defeat him.’ This will be only the 21st fight for a 30-year-old of Argentine-Italian extract who still lives in the basement of his parents’ house in Long Island, New York, and plans to continue qualifying to become a doctor when he finishes with the fisticuffs. At which, the PacMan smiles . In that unassuming way of his. Kindly, but convinced he holds all the chips. And utterly impervious to the temptations of the vast gaming floor at the Venetian Hotel. Place your bets. Pacquiao v Algieri will be televised live in Britain on BoxNation late Saturday night.","Manny Pacquiao will fight American Chris Algieri on Saturday in Macau .

"Spain's Rafael Cabrera-Bello managed something even Rory McIlroy was unable to do as he surged into contention for the season-ending DP World Tour Championship on Friday. McIlroy birdied four of the first five holes on the Earth Course at Jumeirah Golf Estates on his way to an opening 66 which gave him a share of the lead with Shane Lowry on six under par. The world No 1's only aberration in that brilliant return to action after a six-week lay-off was missing from six feet for birdie on the third, but Cabrera-Bello showed him how it was done on Friday. Spain's Rafael Cabrera-Bello had a difficult first round, but opened with five birdies at the start of his second . Rory McIlroy (left) is tied for the lead in Dubai after the first round after shooting a superb six-under par . McIlroy's shares the lead with Shane Lowry of Ireland, who also carded a round of six-under par . The 30-year-old had managed just two birdies in his opening 73 to lie seven shots off the pace, but picked up shots at each of the first five holes of his second round to improve to four under par. That took him to within two of the lead and into a share of fifth place, with McIlroy and Lowry still more than two hours away from beginning their rounds. Northern Ireland's Graeme McDowell was also moving in the right direction in ideal conditions, the Ryder Cup star collecting birdies at the first and second to move to two under.","Rafael Cabrera-Bello birdies the opening five holes in his second round .

"Rory McIlroy admitted he was glad to ‘get his head down and play golf again’ after a six-week break where court rather than course matters have taken priority. The 25-year-old’s brilliant season has unfolded despite being involved in an increasingly bitter legal battle with his former management company. McIlroy had to pull out of two tournaments in China last month to sift through documents with his lawyers ahead of a case that should finally reach a Dublin courtroom early next year. ‘At least over the past week I’ve been able to get my head down and focus on my golf again,’ he said.

'Team McIlroy' - Caddie JP Fitzgerald, coach Michael Bannon, McIlroy and sports scientist Stephen McGregor . McIlroy is back on the golf course after a distracting few weeks focusing on a court case . McIlroy was so far ahead of the rest his enforced absence still made no difference with regard to him winning the Race to Dubai. That was sewn up last Sunday, but he’s determined that this week’s season finale, the DP World Tour Championship, is something more than just a 72-hole lap of honour. ‘I’m proud obviously of the way I played this season and how many points I accumulated to win the Race to Dubai but there would be no point me just showing up here if I didn’t want to pick up two trophies on Sunday rather than one,’ he warned. ‘I’m not here just to have a good time, and I’m comfortable playing on this course. I’ve played well here basically every year and I won the event in 2012. ‘So it would be nice to finish the season off with another win, and it could be that I’m a lot fresher than most of the guys and can use that to my advantage. I think there’s a few jaded minds and bodies among the players who have played the last three events in China and Turkey.’ Legal matters aside, McIlroy was in fine fettle. He underlined his commitment to the European Tour with some good news about the Irish Open, which he will host at Royal County Down next May. McIlroy won both The Open and the USPGA Championship during a dream year for the Northern Irishman . ‘I’m going to use all the influence I have to persuade players to compete in it and I’m glad to announce that Rickie Fowler has agreed to come over and play,’ he said. ‘Rickie has become a good friend and hopefully he will be just the start of a few names coming on board and playing. We actually played each other in the Walker Cup at Royal County Down in 2007, so it will be nice to rekindle that contest in a way, and we’ve had a good few battles this year as well, in the majors and the Ryder Cup.’ McIlroy defeated Fowler down the stretch to win both The Open and the USPGA Championship, before wiping the floor with him in a singles match at the Ryder Cup at Gleneagles. McIlroy might be the star attraction but he’s far from the only one at this event that begins on Thursday. The top 60 players in Europe are here, including all 12 members of the victorious Ryder Cup team.","Rory McIlroy plays in DP World Tour Championship in Dubai this week .

"Ian Poulter was busy on the practice ground here at the DP World Tour Championship on Wednesday trying out a putting tip given to him by Australian legend Greg Norman. The pair spoke on Tuesday night after Norman spotted something while watching Poulter throw away a golden opportunity to win the Turkish Airlines Open last week. ‘I really appreciate someone with the stature of Greg taking the time to try and help me, it is very good of him,’ said Poulter. Ian Poulter says he has spoken to Australian golfing hero Greg Norman about his putting game . ‘Whether he’s right or not, I’ll let you know on Sunday night. The problem I’ve got is that I’ve been working very hard on my putting recently, and it is a fine line of whether you mess and try something else. But I’ve certainly taken on board what he said and I’ll review the footage myself and work on the putting green and see whether he was right or wrong.’ In some ways the conclusion to that tournament in Turkey summed up a disappointing year for Poulter. Six shots ahead at one stage, he had a 6ft putt on the home green to force a play-off with American Brooks Koepka but, wholly uncharacteristically, missed it. On the positive side, it was his second high finish in a row at the end of a season featuring precious few such highlights. He can also take encouragement from a late-season change of equipment manufacturer from Cobra to Titleist clubs that has clearly gone off without a hitch. Now, in his own words, he is ‘desperate to salvage something from 2014’ with a win in this big bucks season finale. ‘I’ve had some good finishes here and it is a course that I really like,’ said Poulter, who lost a play-off to Robert Karlsson here in 2010 and was pipped by another Swede, Henrik Stenson, last year. Norman gave Poulter advice on Tuesday night ahead of the season-ending DP World Tour Championship . Poulter has Stenson in his sights once more this year, albeit the stakes are much lower this time. Twelve months ago, the Race to Dubai was at stake and the close friends had a good-natured bet which involved the loser serving drinks to the winner. This time the Race to Dubai has already been wrapped by Rory McIlroy, leaving Poulter to try to pip Stenson for second place, and a tidy bonus of £512,000. ‘There’s still a lot of money at stake, so it would certainly be nice to catch him’ said Poulter. ‘But there’s no bet this year. We’re not going for the whole shooting match, are we? That said, given the year I’ve had, it would be nice to move up that board and finish second. Two weeks ago I was 64th, so there’s clearly the chance to salvage something from 2014.’ Poulter finished runner-up at the Turkish Airlines Open last week despite leading by six shots at one point .","Ian Poulter finished second at the Turkish Airlines Open last week .

"England say hooker Josh Hodgson will be disciplined after smashing through a door during a party in Dunedin at the end of their Four Nations tour. Footage of the incident below shows the former Hull KR forward taking a run-up and hurling himself through the closed door of a student flat then celebrating. The incident came in the wake of England's 16-14 defeat by New Zealand which cost them a place in next Saturday's final in Wellington. England's Josh Hodgson takes a running jump and smashes through a closed door in a Dunedin apartment . Hodgson climbs back through the hole he created and celebrates during a party in New Zealand . JoHodgson in action for England in the Four Nations match against Australia on November 2 . Hodgson, 25, who is to stay on in the southern hemisphere to take up a two-year contract with Canberra Raiders, was dropped for his country's final round-robin game after making his Test debut against Samoa in the opening game of the tournament in Brisbane. He also played in the defeat by Australia in Melbourne. The event rekindles memories of the acts of alcohol-fuelled incidents that marred England's 2013 World Cup campaign, in which Gareth Hock was thrown out of the squad, Zak Hardaker was punished for breaking the rules and other players faced disciplinary action on the eve of the opening game, although a spokesman for the tourists said the players were given permission to go out. England issued a statement apologising for the incident and pledging to arrange for the repairs to be made to the door. Hodgson, pictured right for Super League side Hull KR, is in hot water after allegedly smashing the door . The statement, issued on behalf of the squad by team manager Jon Roberts, said: 'We were made aware of an incident that occurred last night around lunchtime today. 'It is being dealt with internally with the person involved and they will be disciplined. 'The players were given permission to go out after last night's game. 'On behalf of England Rugby League, we apologise for the behaviour and have arranged for the repair of the small amount of damage. England lost 16-14 to New Zealand on Saturday, a result which means they will not play in the final next week . After the game in Dunedin, the England players went on a night out to celebrate the end of the tour . 'We have had a great time in Dunedin and the city has made us welcome. Last night's match was a great spectacle for International rugby league and we look forward to returning to the city in the future.'

"Big-race jockey issues for trainer Alan King have been allayed this weekend at least with news that Denis O’Regan will be on board Medermit should he take his chance in the Betfair Chase at Haydock on Saturday. King, still awaiting the return of long-time ally Robert Thornton, is now sweating over the immediate future of his other main rider Wayne Hutchinson, who will have a scan on a knee he injured at Doncaster on Tuesday. Hutchinson missed three rides at Warwick yesterday, including the King-trained winner Lady Persephone who landed the Bumper under in-form substitute Richard Johnson. Denis O’Regan will be on board Medermit should he take his chance in the Betfair Chase at Haydock . Hutchinson rode Medermit on his seasonal debut when fourth to Menorah in the Charlie Hall Chase at Wetherby. But King confirmed the 10-year-old’s owners, The Dunkley & Reilly Partnership, have struck a deal for O’Regan to ride the three horses in his stable – the other two being promising novice chaser Ned Stark and The Pirate’s Queen, who won at Doncaster on Tuesday. King said: ‘Denis will ride Medermit if he runs on Saturday. He has an agreement with the owners. Wayne is having a scan on his knee and we are waiting for the result.’ Trainer Alan King (left) chats with jockey Barry Geraghty after day three of the 2014 Open at Cheltenham . Should Hutchinson, who has a history of knee problems, also face a period on the sidelines King will have to line up new jockeys for his two Hennessy Gold Cup hopes – Smad Place and Midnight Prayer – at Newbury a week on Saturday. Smad Place, a 10-1 shot and runner-up in the RSA Chase in March, has never been ridden by anyone other than Hutchinson and Thornton since he arrived from France in 2010. Trainer Nigel Twiston-Davies, who runs Champion Hurdle hope The New One in Betfair Price Rush Hurdle at Haydock on Saturday, intends running Charlie Hall Chase third Double Ross in the Betfair Chase. Robert Thornton (right) clears the last on Medermit to win the Totepool Challengers Novices' Steeple Chase . Jockey son Sam will be back on board. He is available because Noel Fehily has an agreement to retain the ride on his Paul Nicholls-trained King George VI Chase winner Silviniaco Conti. Nicholls and Twiston-Davies combined for a bloodless 12-length success with Ptit Zig in the Highflyer/Million In Mind Novices’ Chase at Warwick. It was a second chase win for the grade-one winning hurdler, who was sixth in this year’s Champion Hurdle. He could now be stepped up in class with a target at Ascot’s pre-Christmas meeting. Nicholls said: ‘He hasn’t been the most natural jumper and we have had to do a lot of work schooling him.

"Before discussing Rory McIlroy’s latest wonder round at the DP World Tour Championship it’s worth stressing that the Earth Course measures almost 7,700 yards and more than a third of the field comprising the European Tour’s top 60 golfers failed to break par. McIlroy, who has never shot worse than the regulation mark in 21 rounds here dating back to 2009, shot a bogey-free 66 to be tied for the lead with Irishman Shane Lowry after the first day and lower his course average to 68.2 strokes. To put that utterly ludicrous figure into context, only six players managed to better that mark on Tuesday. This was the world No 1’s sixth score of 66, to place alongside five 67s, two 68s, two 69s, five 71s and that solitary 72. Again, for the purposes of perspective, Sergio Garcia shot 73, Ian Poulter 75, while recent tour winners Mikko Ilonen, Marcel Siem and Brooks Koepka shot 74, 76 and 78 respectively. Yes, on the Earth Course McIlroy really is otherworldly. Rory McIlroy tees off on the first hole during the first round of the DP World Tour Championship in Dubai . The Northern Irishman shot 66 to be tied for the lead with Irishman Shane Lowry after the first day . McIlroy had suggested in the build-up that six weeks away from the game would sharpen his appetite rather than dull his competitive edge and so it proved. Remember the start he made to his singles match at the Ryder Cup, where he blew Rickie Fowler away in the first few holes? Here we had more of the same, and five holes worth of shot-making to begin with that illustrated once more why he has moved several strides ahead of the competition during this stellar year. Standing on the sixth tee, he was already breathing down the necks of the leaders. He was four under par and would have been five but for a missed birdie putt from short length at the third. Sometimes, though, it’s the putts for par that are far more important. One came at the difficult 12th where, following a relatively humdrum run of six straight pars, he was actually in danger of dropping a stroke. But a beautifully played pitch left him a six-foot putt, which he holed. McIlroy was already four under par on the sixth hole after narrowly missing out on a birdie on the third . The 25-year-old lines up a putt on the first green to begin his wonder round at the Earth Course . McIlroy's supporters were out in full force to see him from whatever vantage points they could find . McIlroy returned to the birdie trail with 12-foot putts at the 15th and 16th. Now he is threatening to effectively wrap up the destination of this title before the 72nd hole on Sunday, having completed formalities already in the Race to Dubai. Why does this course suit him so? It’s a bomber’s paradise, pure and simple, and no-one pounds it longer and straighter than McIlroy. As his playing partner Henrik Stenson — no slouch himself — said: ‘With his length he was able to take on a couple of carries I couldn’t manage and, as he was in position A1 pretty much all day, it gave him a huge advantage.’ McIlroy could hardly contain his enthusiasm in the build-up to the first round. ‘Just under three hours until I hit my first competitive golf shot in six weeks. To say I’m excited is an understatement,’ he tweeted, complete with the daring hashtag: #imready. Well, daring until he’d played the first five holes anyway, and showed he was more than ready. The picturesque Jumeirah Golf Estates in Dubai saw some of McIlroy's finest golf on Thursday . Before teeing off McIlroy could harldy contain his excitement but gave a perfectly composed performance . Much of McIlroy’s time away was spent preparing legal documents for a forthcoming courtroom showdown with his former management company, Horizon Sports. How ironic, then, that the only man who should match him on this day was Horizon- managed Lowry. Lowry is 52nd in the world and needs a good finish here to break into the top 50 and secure a first invitation to the Masters. He’s squandered a couple of good opportunities already in recent weeks and admitted: ‘It has been on my mind for a while.’ It certainly did not show down the run-in here, as he picked up four shots in the final six holes. One man who will not be conceding the title to McIlroy at this stage is in-form defending champion Stenson, who shot 68. Comeback of the day came from Englishman Justin Rose, who played the first 10 holes in a horrible four over but the last eight in five under to salvage a 71.","Rory McIlroy hit an opening round 66 at the DP World Tour Championship .

While no hairline fractures were detected, trainer Gary Moore has been left unsure how long his gelding, who won four grade one chases last season, including the Tingle Creek and Queen Mother Champion Chase, will be sidelined. Moore said: ‘He's not fractured his pelvis or suffered a stress fracture or anything, but he does have a hot area in his hip.

"Philip Hobbs and stable jockey Richard Johnson walked away from Cheltenham after turning the Open Meeting into a virtual closed shop. Combined success with Garde La Victoire in the Greatwood Hurdle and the Arkle Trophy Chase Trial with Dunraven Storm took Hobbs’ tally to six in the 19 races run over the three days. Johnson took his haul to seven when winning the concluding Listed Bumper on Steve Gollings-trained Definitly Red. Stable jockey Richard Johnson (far right) and Philip Hobbs (far left) celebrate Garde Le Victorie's success at the The Open at Cheltenham Racecourse . Johnson’s feat – he was only eligible to ride in 17 of the races - matched that of AP McCoy, who won seven races at the meeting in 2001. Hobbs, who had sent out Balthazar King, Champagne West and Bold Henry to win on Friday plus Golden Doyen on Saturday, couldn’t quite match the achievement of Martin Pipe – he produced seven Open meeting winners in 2001, 2002 and 2004 – but his reward is to be sitting at the top of a trainers’ championship table most expected to be a three-cornered fight between Paul Nicholls, Nicky Henderson and Jonjo O’Neill. Hobbs said: ‘Before the meeting started I said I would settle for two winners and Richard said three. To have six is phenomenal. ‘I could not have imagined it in my wildest dreams. It was borderline whether we ran today’s two winners because we thought it might be too soft for them. We will enjoy it while we can.’ The Arkle Chase could prove the ultimate aim for 7-2 winner Dunraven Storm, who held off favourite Vibrato Valtat on whom jockey San Twiston-Davies seemed to overdo the waiting tactics. Johnson holds the trophy after winning the TheStanJames.com Greatwood Hurdle on Day three of The Open . After his heroics for new boss Paul Nicholls on Saturday when winning the Paddy Power Gold Cup on Caid Du Berlais, it will not be the last blip on a learning curve and Nicholls must equally acknowledge he has invested for the future in a young talent. Hobbs, whose understated demeanour often means his successes do not achieve the attention they deserve, brushed off any notion Garde La Victoire may be a Champion Hurdle outsider by saying the 10-1 winner was ‘about 20lbs’ below the standard required. Action more pertinent to that race took place at Punchestown where Hurricane Fly proved there is still life in his 10-year-old legs with third consecutive win in the Morgiana Hurdle when beating reigning champion Jezki two and a half lengths. Alan King’s Uxizandre, under an exquisite front-running Barry Geraghty ride, landed the Shloer Chase. Hills make him 16-1 for the Queen Mother Champion Chase. But attention in that division is of stars trying to overcome problems. We should find out after a bone scan on Tuesday if reigning champion Sire De Grugy has suffered a hairline pelvic fracture or less serious muscle pull while Nicky Henderson said 2013 title holder Sprinter Sacre, sidelined last term by a fibrillating heart, will have a racecourse gallop before being given the go ahead to run in the Tingle Creek Chase at Sandown on December 6. Henderson said: ‘He has had his MOT and heart-wise everything is fine.'","Garde La Victorie reigned victorious on the third day at Cheltenham .

Jockeys Richard Johnson (left) and Barry Geraghty take part in a memorial for Irish Trainer Dessie Hughes . Hughes, whose son Richard last week won his third champion jockeys’ title, was one of the few men in racing who could claim to have an equal success as a jockey as well as a trainer. His eight Cheltenham Festival winners as a jockey also included the 1977 Gold Cup on Davy Lad, part of a fruitful partnership with trainer Mick O’Toole. After he switched to training, Hughes managed six Festival winners, most notably Hardy Eustace, successful in the 2003 Neptune Investement Novices’ Hurdle before landing the 2004 and 2005 Champion Hurdle. Jockeys line up to observe a minutes silence after the death of Dessie Hughes at Cheltenham racecourse . As well as being a top trainer Hughes will be remembered for his talents as a jockey, winning eight races . Conor O’Dwyer, who rode Hardy Eustace, said: ‘I've ridden for many good people during my career, but Dessie really stood out as a proper gentleman. ‘No one ever had a bad word to say about Dessie, and Dessie never had a bad word to say about anyone.’","Former jockey Dessie Hughes died on November 16 at the age of 71 .

"Don't expect Barry Geraghty to turn into the green-eyed monster looking at colleague’s rides any time soon – there is no need. Lining up for the 35-year-old Irishman in the coming weeks should be his 2013 Cheltenham Gold Cup winner Bobs Worth, King George VI Chase favourite Simonsig and recuperating 2013 Champion Chase winner Sprinter Sacre. Geraghty also has an enthusiastic eye on future talent. Barry Geraghty wins the Doom Bar Sefton Novices Hurdle with Beat That . Geraghty is looking ahead to racing up and coming horses including Beat That and Vaniteux . That’s why missing riding Jezki, his Champion Hurdle winner in March, on his return to action against Hurricane Run in Saturday's Morgiana Hurdle at Punchestown and More Of That, his World Hurdle winner, in the Long Distance Hurdle at Newbury later this month, will not spark a hint of a tantrum. Geraghty said: ‘I can’t say I am overly envious of anyone. I got a great ride from More Of That and Jezki last season. They are two horses you’d like to ride but I hope to have two young horses to step up and snap at their heels in Beat That and Vaniteux. ‘Beat That was a frame of a horse last year and did well to win at Punchestown and Aintree. He should improve a lot physically. The hope is that he will be a World Hurdle Hurdle horse. More Of That sets the standard but he should have a shout.’ Geraghty celebrates after winning the Ladbrokes World Hurdle at Chelteham with More Of That . The Irish jockey races to victory on Jetzski at the Champion Hurdle at Cheltenham . Geraghty’s aspirations for Vaniteux, third in the Supreme Novices’ Hurdle in March, will be tested when he carries top weight of 11st 12lb in tomorrow’s Greatwood Hurdle. Geraghty said: ‘Even though he has top weight, his handicap mark is reasonable. He has pace but he doesn’t lack physique – he is very strong.’ Geraghty rides Oscar Whisky for his boss Nicky Henderson in Saturday afternoon’s Paddy Power Gold Cup, a race he won in 2002 on Cyfor Malta. Geraghty (C) leads eventual winner Parlour Games to victory at the Hyde Novices’ Hurdle . The three-time Grade One winner has not yet matched best hurdles form when chasing but Geraghty feels he knows the key. The rider said: ‘The big thing is to get him into a rhythm jumping. If he does, he has a big chance.’ Geraghty’s Open Meeting got off to a good start on Friday, easily landing the Grade Two Hyde Novices’ Hurdle on John Ferguson-trained 10-1 Parlour Games. The six-year-old, now the same odds to the Neptune Investment Novices’ Hurdle at the Festival in March, showed a classy turn of foot, hardly surprising given he won the 2011 Melrose Stakes at York and his dam is 2000 Irish Oaks winner Petrushka. BHA and Cheltenham will not change the start time of the Paddy Power Gold Cup, despite fears it could be disrupted by low sunlight. Only 10 of the 16 obstacles were jumped in Friday's novices’ chase won by Champagne West which started at 2.25pm. Today’s race is off at 2.30pm. Spokesman Robin Mounsey said the chance of a problem was ‘low risk’ but BHA will hope to avoid an embarrassing hat-trick. Two weeks ago the Charlie Hall Chase at Wetherby was run over the wrong distance. Last week’s Badger Beer Chase at Wincanton was ‘won’ by ineligible entry The Young Master, subsequently disqualified.","Barry Geraghty has no reason to envy any of his colleague's rides .

"Tony McCoy has targeted a race-riding comeback in the middle of next week as he strives to regain full fitness before More Of That’s seasonal reappearance in the Bet365 Long Distance Hurdle at Newbury a week on Saturday. The 19-time champion jockey was last in the saddle on November 5. He has been sidelined since while he recovers from an old rib injury he aggravated in a fall at Exeter. McCoy said of More Of That: ‘He looks a very smart horse and he is the reason I’ve ended up taking so long to come back. I’ll hopefully now be OK for the rest of the season.’ Tony McCoy will race to regain fitness before Bet365 Long Distance Hurdle at Newbury a week on Saturday . The 19-time champion jockey was sidelined after aggravating an old rib injury following a fall at Exeter . The Irishman rode at Chepstow the day after coming off at Exeter but, experiencing continued pain, decided to take a couple of weeks off to fully recover. He could make his comeback at Fontwell or Wetherby next Wednesday after an X-ray yesterday confirmed his recuperation is going to plan. McCoy’s extended absence has opened up an opportunity for Barry Geraghty, who has been booked to ride Taquin du Seuil in tomorrow’s Betfair Chase at Haydock. The Cheltenham Festival winner was one of nine horses to stand their ground for the chasing feature, which also includes last year’s winner Cue Card. Dynaste, who chased Cue Card home prior to winning the Ryanair Chase in March, is also in a strong field.

"The Milwaukee Bucks drew first blood against the New York Knicks ahead of their meeting in London in January with a 117-113 win on Tuesday. Guided by 20 points from forward Ersan Ilyasova, the Bucks clinched victory against a Knicks team they will face at a sold-out O2 Arena on January 15.

Milwaukee Bucks forward Ersan Ilyasova (right) is congratulated by centre Zaza Pachulia . Ilyasova scored 20 points as the Bucks beat the Knicks 117-113 . The Bucks will head to New York to take on the Knicks for a second time this season at Madison Square Garden on January 4 before their meeting in London 11 days later. Ilyasova was one of seven Bucks players in double figures while Carmelo Anthony led the way for the New York Knicks with 26 points. Tim Hardaway Jnr added 24 points for New York while Iman Shumpert chipped in with 21, but it was in a losing effort for the Knicks as they fell further behind Atlantic Division leaders Toronto. Knicks guard Iman Shumpert (right) drives past Milwaukee Bucks guard Giannis Antetokounmpo . After a 30-30 opening period, the Knicks will be rueing a poor second quarter in which they scored just 19 points and conceded 36. And despite their best efforts in the second half and down the stretch, the Knicks were unable to claw their way back. Another problem for the Knicks is that their scoring machine Anthony is playing with a sore left knee. Anthony returned to the locker room for a couple of minutes in the second quarter to get it re-taped. The 30-year-old said he aggravated his already sore knee after hitting the floor while scrambling for a loose ball. It was Milwaukee's sixth win in their opening 11 games, but it was the Knicks ninth defeat in 12 . 'I've had some tests. I really don't know exactly what's going on with it - I mean, I know what's going on with it,' Anthony said. 'But like I said, for me it's just a matter of just not kind of thinking about and playing through it. 'The tape job that I had kind of got wet a little bit. I started feeling it a little bit after that. We cut the tape off on the bench and I just started feeling a little bit more pain. It felt better once I got it re-taped.' Knicks head coach Derek Fisher added: 'We played a lot of games in a short time and you know Melo's obviously carrying a big load. I’m sure he'll be OK. We'll keep an eye on him and make sure he's good though.'

Doha beat off competition from Eugene and Barcelona to earn the vote of the IAAF council following presentations from all three cities in Monaco. But the decision has already been questioned by reigning world 400m champion Christine Ohuruogu, who said endurance athletes in particular could be at risk. An aerial view of the Qatari capital of Doha - where the 2019 World Championships will be held . Qatari officials have moved quickly to ease fears that heat could prove a health risk to the games . Ohuruogu told the Guardian: 'To have the extra pressure of your body having to work against that heat, I just wonder how many people will manage. 'It's a concern. Maybe the sprinters can get away with it because they are not out there for that long but for the guys who are running laps and laps, they are pushing their bodies to the limit anyway, to add the extra ingredient of extreme heat, I would be worried about what would happen to them and their health.' The bidding victory comes amid continued controversy over the award of the 2022 football World Cup to the gulf state, and issues over when the tournament can best be staged. But organisers say they will combat the heat at the World Athletics Championships by staging it between September 28 and October 6 - rather than in August when the championships are usually held.

One of the major sticking points over Qatar staging football's biggest showpiece have been the high temperatures in the region, but the Qatar Olympic Committee's senior advisor Aphrodite Moschoudi reassured the council during Doha's presentation that this will not be a problem for the World Championships.

"Trainer Colin Tizzard says Cue Card has been showing ‘electric’ form in his home work as he attempts to win the Haydock’s Betfair Chase for the second year running. Daryl Jacob’s mount was fourth to God’s Own in the two-mile Haldon Gold Cup at the start of the month, his first run since finishing second to Silviniaco Conti, one of his rivals on Saturday, in the King George VI Chase on Boxing Day. That effort from the 3-1 favourite, his first since recuperating from a pelvis injury, left some questioning his status going into the more suitable longer test. Trainer Colin Tizzard expects a strong run from Cue Card on Saturday after recovering from pelvic injury . But Tizzard, who combined with Jacob to win the Oaks Loans Graduation Chase with Third Intention, is in no doubt. ‘He hadn’t run for 10 and a half months,’ said the trainer. ‘We were giving away stacks of weight. Daryl is positive, he said, “Would any of the three-mile chasers we are taking on have done any better in that race?” I doubt it. ‘It has sharpened him up brilliantly. I said after his very first race that no-one could hold him and he is a bit like that now. He has gone from coming up the gallops just off the bridle to electric.’ Jacob, who also won the opener at Haydock on Emma Lavelle’s Closing Ceremony, added: ‘I have been buzzing about this horse since Exeter. ‘Some people questioned the form but I think it was a blinding run.

HEADLINE-MAKER . Chicago Bulls point guard Derrick Rose was named the 2008-09 Rookie of the Year and 2010-11 NBA MVP. However he has been hampered by injuries and has missed most of two years with serious knee injuries. After missing four of the first seven games this season, he courted controversy. He said: 'I know a lot of people get mad when they see me sit out or whatever, but ... when I sit out, it's not because of this year. I'm thinking about long term. I'm thinking about, after I'm done with basketball, having graduations to go to, having meetings to go to. I don't want to be in my meetings all sore or be at my son's graduation all sore just because of something I did in the past, so it's just learning and being smart.' Following his comments the Chicago Sun Times front page simply read 'Priority' with the sub-text 'Rose has odd reason for choosing to sit out so many games on Bulls' time.'

"A top jockey who claimed he was sleep-walking when he was found asleep at the wheel of his BMW twice over the alcohol limit has been banned from driving. Tom Queally claimed he had not been drinking, then 'rolled' out of a police car and lay down on the ground after being arrested, Crewe Magistrates' Court heard. But his lawyer Nick Freeman, known as 'Mr Loophole' claimed the 30-year-old, most famous for being the regular jockey of 'wonder horse' Frankel, was 'morally totally innocent' as he was 'sleep-driving' at the time and claimed the law needed to be changed. Jockey Tom Queally has been banned from driving after he was found to be twice over the legal alcohol limit . Celebrity lawyer Mr Freeman has previously represented Frank Lampard, David Beckham, Jeremy Clarkson and Jimmy Carr - all on driving-related charges. He claimed Queally was forced to admit the charge of drink driving because the law had not caught up with medical science in recognising sleep-walking as a legal defence for drink driving. The jockey, from Dungarvan, Ireland, but now living at Oak Lodge, Newmarket, admitted drink driving on March 16. Kate Marchup, prosecuting, told the court that around 5am on March 16 a man driving home from a night shift spotted Queally 'either asleep or looking down at his mobile phone' with his car parked in the carriageway of Knutsford Road in Knutsford, Cheshire. The 'concerned' driver went back and saw another vehicle parked behind Queally's BMW and a young man asking the jockey if he had been drinking. Queally then  drove off but his registration number was taken. The jockey is most famous for being the regular rider of 'wonder horse' Frankel . His BMW was then spotted parked up on the forecourt of a Shell garage in the village of Chelford, nearly five miles away. At 5.40am an officer arrived and found Queally asleep at the wheel with the car lights on and the engine running. He gave a positive breath test and was arrested. Queally gave a reading of 84 microgrammes of alcohol in 100 millilitres of breath. The legal limit is 35mg. Mr Freeman, mitigating, said a number of 'trigger events' prompted an episode of sleep-walking that led Queally, a man of no previous convictions and 'exemplary character' to get in the car. He said Queally used to ride for Sir Henry Cecil, who had recently died, an ex-girlfriend had committed suicide and he had suffered the break-up of a long term relationship. On the night of the incident he enjoyed an evening out in Hale, Cheshire with his friend and manager Nicholas Whittle and his 'last recollection' was reading Hare and Hounds on a bed at Mr Whittle's house around 2am. Queally initally claimed he had not been drinking, then 'rolled' out of a police car and lay down on the ground . Mr Freeman told the court: 'The thrust of my mitigation is he's completely unaware of what he's doing. He's sleep-driving. 'The defendant's next recollection is actually being in the back of a police vehicle.' Mr Freeman added that there was a history of sleep-walking in Queally's family - and the defendant had sleep-walked from the age of five. But he had never 'sleep-driven' before, which happened due to these 'trigger events'. Mr Freeman said the law did not allow him to argue 'special reasons' and the defendant pleaded not guilty on the basis of sleep-walking while drink driving. He added: 'I don't think the law has kept up with scientific developments, because it seems simply unfair for a man of this quality now to have a criminal conviction for something which in my view, he's morally totally innocent. It would seem to fly in the face of natural justice.' Queally leaves Cheshire Magistrates' Court accompanied by his celebrity solicitor Nick 'Loophole' Freeman . Dr Irshad Ebrahim, a consultant psychiatrist called by the defence to give evidence, told the court he had twice examined the defendant. Dr Ebrahim said it was possible Queally was unaware of his actions because of his sleep-walking. 'It is an automatic state, like a trance state, where there's no control of it,' he said. After listening to the defence mitigation, District Judge Bridget Knight said previous legal authorities had ruled sleep-walking was not a defence for drink driving. She added: 'The law is quite clear, you would be deemed to be driving in such circumstances even if affected by some sleep disorder.' Judge Knight disqualified Queally for 22 months, fined him £1,350, with a victim surcharge of £120 and ordered he pay the prosecution costs of £3,500. Queally told the court he will pay within seven days. Outside court Mr Freeman said: 'Because drink driving is a crime that doesn't require any specific intent, he can't argue this as a defence or a special reason. 'The law needs to be changed to reflect this unique set of circumstances.'

The former model added: 'It’s been a rollercoaster of emotions, not just over the last three days but for the entire campaign. I won’t lie, it’s a great shame we weren't able to be a little more competitive in our class but I've come to learn that in rallying nothing is predictable. We could run the rally again right now without all the problems we had or have even worse luck. 'All of the team have been amazing and we wouldn't have finished without the ProSpeed guys working through both nights so a massive thanks to them and everyone else involved. 'Personally I've been pushed to the very edge, but the admiration I now have for the rallying world is second to none. Thank you to all the fans that lined the stages. It’s an experience I will never forget.' Jardine paid tribute to his co-driver after a gruelling few days of competition in which they encountered a number of problems.

Her mental state is as good as any of the top co-drivers and, considering how far she has come in just eight weeks, she could really go on to be an even better co-driver if she wants to. 'I'm very sorry that I cost us a higher finish with the crash on Friday, as well as a couple of other mistakes, but she can be so proud of her performance to get us here. I'm so pleased to have crossed the line. It has been the toughest rally I think I've ever done.'

"Oscar Pistorius' lawyers have filed court papers opposing prosecutors move to appeal the verdict and sentence in his murder trial. Pistorius' defense lawyers say that Judge Thokozile Masipa should not refer the Olympic runner's case to South Africa's Supreme Court of Appeal because there has been no error in law. The defense's papers were filed Monday, according to a court stamp. Oscar Pistorius, pictured, was found guilty of the culpable homicide of Reeva Steenkamp at his home . Reva Steenkamp, pictured, was gunned down in the house she shared with Pistorius on Valentine's Day 2013 . Prosecutors want to overturn the culpable homicide verdict to retry the case for a stiffer jail sentence . Masipa found Pistorius not guilty of murder for shooting girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp through a toilet cubicle door. Instead, she convicted him on a lesser charge of manslaughter and sentenced him to five years in prison. Pistorius' lawyers say Masipa 'correctly applied' the law when she acquitted him of murder. Prosecutors must first ask for Masipa's permission to appeal against the verdict and the sentence she gave Pistorius.

"Aston Villa are monitoring 20-year-old Rangers starlet Lewis MacLeod. Club scouts saw him impress against Alloa Athletic on Saturday in the Scottish Championship match and he created Rangers’ goal in a 1-1 draw which keeps them in the hunt for a third successive automatic promotion. The midfielder gained his first call-up to the full Scotland squad for the qualifier against Ireland last week and tonight’s friendly clash with England but was released by Gordon Strachan to play for his club on Saturday. Lewis MacLeod has impressed for Rangers in the Scottish Championship and could move to Aston Villa . MacLeod earned his first Scotland call-up and could feature on the bench against England .

"Paul Lambert has blasted the Swiss FA over their 'mismanagement' of Philippe Senderos after the Aston Villa defender pulled his calf on international duty. Senderos will be out for four weeks at a crucial time for Lambert, and is expected to miss matches against Southampton, Crystal Palace, Burnley, Leicester and West Brom. The 29-year-old had only just returned for Villa, coming on as a late substitute against West Ham, after recovering from a thigh injury picked up playing in Switzerland’s Euro 2016 qualifier against Slovenia on October 9. Aston Villa will be without defender Philippe Senderos for up to a month due to a calf injury . But he was called up again by Switzerland manager Vladimir Petkovic and damaged his calf during a training exercise. Lambert fumed: 'That's the one I'm not happy about at all, Philippe. He is the one which has annoyed me the most. He went away with his national team and if you look at his record he has only played six minutes, against West Ham, for a month. 'He goes away with Switzerland and ends up pulling his calf in a training exercise.It's mismanagement from the FA in Switzerland. They should have been in dialogue and seen his record in the first place and that he didn't play for a month. Senderos (front) picked up the injury while on international duty during a training session with Switzerland . 'It's OK for them to go away and think ""We have only lost a centre-half"" but we have lost him for a month again when he has been a vital part of the team.’ Senderos was a vital player in Villa’s promising start to the season and his absence has been felt during a difficult run of one point in seven matches. His injury leaves Villa desperately short at centre-back for the visit of Southampton, with Ron Vlaar injuring his calf on Holland duty and Nathan Baker out with a knee problem. Aston Villa boss Paul Lambert has slammed Switzerland for 'mismanaging' Senderos . Danish international Jores Okore, 22, comes into contention for Monday night’s match against Southampton at Villa Park. 'We still have options but in Philippe's case it should have been avoided. He was totally fine when he came on in that little cameo role against West Ham,' Lambert added. 'Jores is just coming back from an injury but he's getting better. We have lost two experienced players who have been playing well.’ Ciaran Clark (right) is only one of two centre-backs fit for Villa's Monday night clash at home vs Southampton .","Aston Villas' Philippe Senderos is out for up to a month with a calf injury .

An error from Jari-Matti Latvala during tough conditions on Friday’s opening leg had put him into a ditch and lost three minutes as a result to push Ogier back in overall command of the rally. 'My rally changed when Jari-Matti made a mistake and I had control and could ease my pace,' added Ogier. 'It wasn’t the most fun way to drive, but in the slippery conditions I had to do it.

"Burnley boss Sean Dyche believes his side's victory over Hull can act as a calling card for their Barclays Premier League credentials. The Clarets' top-flight return went without a win for the first 10 games of the season but, just as questions were being asked about whether it might stay that way until May, they turned over the Tigers before the international break. Dyche is too pragmatic a coach to get carried away, especially with his side still propping up the rest of the division, but he is content that the 1-0 success shows Burnley are not out of their depth among the elite. Burnley boss Sean Dyche said the club set down a marker with their first Premier League win of the season . 'One win isn't like we've won the World Cup, one win is us laying a marker down and now we're looking to move it forward,' he said. 'You get that first win and everybody feels a bit better about life. 'That's all we were looking for, that first marker to say we're in the Premier League and we're in here for a reason. 'The players have had a lot of exposure for the wrong reasons this season, with this talk of ""could they win a game, when would they win a game?"" Burnley's Ashley Barnes celebrates after netting the only goal of the game against Hull City . 'It's all so heavily covered that players can get influenced by that over time. I don't think mine have but they could be.' Having had a fortnight to reflect on their winning effort at Turf Moor, Dyche takes his side to ninth-placed Stoke on Saturday. And he is clear about that fact that the first win of the campaign represents the start of the job, not an end in itself. 'It's only one win and we need a lot more,' he said. 'We're bottom of the pile, so we've got to achieve things beyond what we've done so far. Barnes gives the Hull keeper no chance with a towering header from Kieran Trippier's cross . 'We're not thinking we're going to roll into town and pick up three points every week but we feel we can be competitive and that win reinforces our beliefs.' Dyche hopes to have a strong squad to call on at the Britannia Stadium, though striker Sam Vokes is still working his way back from a knee injury that has kept him out since March. Vokes is back in first-team training but not yet match ready, but there is better news elsewhere. 'We're not defining when Sam will be back but he's going well,' said Dyche. 'Steven Reid is back to what you'd consider full fitness and Nathaniel Chalobah had a knock with the England Under 21s but we don't think that's too serious. 'Dean Marney is back too after a hamstring injury, so the squad is coming back to full health.'","Burnley got their first win of the season against Hull City, beating them 1-0 .

Matthew Upson (right) is back in training after a serious knee injury and will play for Leicester's U21s . Upson played for England at the 2010 World Cup, pictured scoring against Germany . Pearson said: 'Matthew has been training very well and he will play some part in a game next week.’ Fellow defender Liam Moore, who missed both England Under-21 matches during the international break, is fit to face Sunderland on Saturday. He was struck down by illness but has recovered after taking a course of medication. ‘It was an infection which, without going into details, needed medication,’ said Pearson. ‘He trained intermittently and is much better now.’ Liam Moore missed both England U21 matches this week, but is fit to face Sunderland on Saturday .","Matthew Upson is yet to feature for Leicester since his summer arrival .

"Crystal Palace boss Neil Warnock has tried to reassure fans that his players are not being distracted by talks of a potential sale of the club. American billionaire Josh Harris has had discussions in recent weeks with Palace, who were rescued from administration four-and-a-half years ago. When asked if the takeover talks had affected the team during the international break, Warnock said in a press conference: 'No, not at all. The lads never talk about it. Neil Warnock believes his Crystal Palace players are focused on trying to keep the club in the Premier League . The Eagles will be hoping to bounce back from their recent 1-0 defeat by Manchester United . Josh Harris has visited Selhurst Park at least three times as he looks into buying Crystal Palace . 'They get on with their own preparation. [The takeover] will only happen if it is for the good of the club.' The consortium which averted the prospect of administration guided Palace back into the Premier League. After finishing 11th last season under Tony Pulis, the team is 17th heading into Sunday's home match against Liverpool. Palace have lost four of their last five games, including a 1-0 defeat at Manchester United last time out. Defensive woes have plagued the club, with Palace possessing the second leakiest defence in the competition having conceded 20 goals in 11 games. Warnock says the players worked hard during the international break to improve. The American billionaire is locked in 'advanced stage' talks with Crystal Palace chairman Steve Parish . Warnock will be hoping his side can replicate last year's performance against Liverpool . 'We have concentrated on the defence,' the 65-year-old said. 'You have to get clean sheets to progress in this league and that is what we will try to do in the next few weeks.' Warnock is also hopeful that his team can be more clinical up front. 'We need to create a little bit more,' he said. 'The teams perhaps have found us a little bit predictable. 'We've had easy opportunities in the past games and we haven't been able to put them away. We have been unlucky but you cannot feel sorry for yourself. 'We have eight games until January and we are looking all around to see if we will improve our squad. But we have a good group. 'We just need more goals.' Warnock also believes the club's famously vocal supporters are another important factor ahead of the Liverpool game at Selhurst Park. 'The fans were instrumental last season,' Warnock said. 'They were unbelievable home and away. It's the group of the fans we have. 'They are a special bunch. Even when playing away from home, you can hear them. 'It's fantastic for the lads. I think on Sunday it promises to be a good atmosphere again. We expect a packed house.'","Neil Warnock has reassured fans that his players are not being distracted .

"A goal against England is the stuff of which childhood dreams are made. The image likely crossed Andy Robertson’s mind when he was kicking about the playground of St Joseph’s Primary. Robertson  returned to his old school in Clarkston on Wednesday for a promotional visit having just realised that very feat. Yet jubilation was the furthest thing from his mind. The Scotland left-back admitted a first strike for his nation meant little in the context of a 3-1 defeat from Roy Hodgson’s classy side at Celtic Park. Andrew Robertson scores for Scotland at Celtic Park during Tuesday's 3-1 defeat to England . Scotland international Robertson returned to his old school on Wednesday for a promotional visit . Sharply critical of his own defensive display, Robertson insisted he would gladly have traded his brief moment of glory for blanking out England at the other end of the field. That kind of clear-eyed self-analysis perhaps speaks volumes of why the 20-year-old has enjoyed such extraordinary progress over the past 18 months. While family and friends would have wanted to re-live the left-foot strike that zipped inside’s Fraser Forster’s near post, Robertson spent Tuesday night agonising over the other 89 minutes. ‘I didn’t get much sleep,’ he admitted. ‘I went straight home and straight to bed, but there was a lot of tossing and turning. I was more trying to think about my defensive performance, not the goal. ‘I’ll find out in time about being able to reflect on the goal but for now it’s at the back of my mind. I’m more disappointed about the overall performance and my own performance. ‘It’s tough one. A normal person would probably have been delighted to score against England to get their first goal for Scotland. But I’ve already forgotten about it. We got beat 3-1 and that’s the most annoying thing for me. Robertson worked his way up from the fourth tier of Scottish football to the Premier League . ‘I thought I could have done better personally in a defensive sense. And first and foremost I am a defender. So if I could have swapped the goal for a clean sheet I would have taken it. ‘I was obviously delighted to see it hit the back of the net. It was a proud moment for me and my family. Maybe for that minute or two I could just enjoy the feeling and hope that I’d helped us get back into the game. Sadly, though, England went up the park and scored again.’ Robertson’s goal came seven minutes from the end and was made at Tannadice. After feeding the ball to fellow former Dundee United player Johnny Russell, he gave the returned cutback the finish it deserved. By that point, England were already two in front. Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain struck first when he ghosted off Robertson’s flank and behind Grant Hanley to convert a sublime delivery from Jack Wilshere. Rooney then claimed the first of his brace by heading home a loose ball that had rebounded off Robertson. Both concessions gave the Hull City defender cause for regret. ‘Looking back at the first goal, I probably should have tucked in and tried to block him,’ reflected Robertson. ‘Even if I did, it was an absolutely world-class ball so I don’t know how much I would have been able to stop it. But I would have been much happier if I had followed him in and tried to stop it, rather than just letting him go. Robertson has worked his way up from playing amateur football with Queen's Park to the Premier League . ‘For the second goal, it could probably happen another 100 times and not fall on Wayne Rooney’s head. I didn’t have much time to react. I didn’t know if someone was behind me so I felt I had to get a leg on it. Unfortunately, it went to the head of a deadly finisher. I wasn’t so annoyed with that one but I felt I should still have done better. ‘We got ourselves back to 2-1 for a short time but England deserved to win overall. It was disappointing we couldn’t put pressure on them for the last 10 minutes. Instead, they went up the pitch and scored again so quickly. But, as I said, looking back on the game we can have no complaints about the result.’ It was a score-line that also prevented the old Scottish trait of getting ahead of ourselves from rearing its head. The national side’s development under Gordon Strachan has been substantial and rightly lauded. Friday night’s win over the Republic of Ireland was the most significant for years and left us firmly in contention for a place at Euro 2016. England’s visit was, however, a reminder of the distance still to be travelled, of how only a maximum collective effort can thwart teams of superior quality. ‘On Tuesday night, the English players were a better standard than us,’ Robertson recognised. ‘But we didn’t play to our best. Hopefully we can get a shot at them again and show what we can do. ‘The next time the squad meets up, we can analyse it and see what went wrong. That will help us for the future. Robertson impressed Gordon Strachan after being invited to join in a training session with the senior team . ‘There were a lot of fans and media saying we were a good team but we knew we still had work to do. We’ve got off to a good start in the Euro 2016 campaign, which is the main thing overall, and hopefully we can kick on from there. The priority for us is to get back to the top end of international football at a major tournament finals.’ It is four months until Scotland are back in action against Gibraltar. Barring the calamity to end all calamities, the next truly meaningful game is the trip to Dublin next June. Robertson will complete a first season in the Barclays Premier League in the interim, having been playing part-time football with Queen’s Park as recently as May 2013. ‘If you had said a year ago that I would have got five Scotland caps in 2014, I would have said you were a liar,’ he insisted. ‘Looking back on it, I’m delighted I can represent my country in such big games. Hopefully there are a lot more happy memories to come. ‘I don’t really set myself targets and challenges. I just try and take everything that comes to me. We will see what is coming in 2015. Hopefully we will still be talking about me playing for Scotland and doing well for Hull City.’ Andrew Robertson visited St Joseph’s in support of Tesco Bank’s Community Programme to promote the health benefits of the game. Run in partnership with the SFA, it has so far involved over 82,000 children from more than 2,000 schools.","Andrew Robertson scored for Scotland in 3-1 defeat to England .

"Xabi Alonso is a midfield maestro. In what has been a stellar career, his highlights include unforgettable Champions League wins with Liverpool and Real Madrid and helping Spain conquer the world. He is now aiming to make history with Bayern Munich and, in his first interview with an English newspaper since moving to Germany, he outlined his ambitions to Sportsmail’s Jamie Carragher. Here are the 10 best quotes from that brilliant interview. Xabi Alonso (left) opens up to former Liverpool team-mate and Sportsmail columnist Jamie Carragher . Alonso and Carragher enjoyed many jokes during a revealing and insightful interview . Alonso was in high spirits as he sat down to talk at Bayern Munich's training ground . CLICK HERE to read the brilliant full interview with Bayern star Xabi Alonso . On leaving Real Madrid: No. I only had this option. There were times I heard some English clubs said 'what would he think' but my idea was to stay in Madrid. Then when I heard of Munich’s interest I said: 'Xabi, think what you want and where you will be happy'. I needed a fresh start somewhere. This might be my last experience in football. I came from my hometown team, Real Sociedad, to the best team in England (smiles); to the best team in Spain to the best team in Germany. I would say it is a beautiful career. I wanted a nice football script. I cannot be a one club man like you! On seeing Liverpool draw Real Madrid in the Champions League: (puts hands over face) Oh my gosh! I was actually in the middle of doing my medical here. I came out from the scan and saw it… . On English teams struggling defensively in Europe: To be fighting at European level, you need players who know how to play in the big games. At this moment, Spanish and German teams have that. English teams have changed so much. Only now do Chelsea look solid. Liverpool did very well last year but this season they are struggling. It takes time. City have won the league twice in three years but they cannot find that mentality in Europe. That makes things difficult. Jerome Boateng celebrates scoring the winner against Manchester City when the teams met in September . Joe Hart was left helpless as Boateng (not pictured) scored the only goal in Bayern's 1-0 win over City . On importance of adaptability: Each team I see (that is successful) has to be comfortable playing three systems. They need to adapt to each game, depending on the circumstances. It is not about not being loyal to your identity. No, no, no. It is about knowing your strengths and showing your players what you need to do each game to prepare in the right way. In Liverpool, you know what it was like: we had a plan for each team. Every game is totally different. Let me give you an example. This season we have played with three defenders, sometimes four, sometimes five. You need to be able to manage at least three or four systems. It has nothing to do with betraying your principles of football. On Cristiano Ronaldo being the best player in world: For sure. I said recently if Manuel Neuer or another German player won the Ballon d’Or, it would be fair as they won the World Cup. But if Ronaldo wins it again, it would also be fair for the season he had, winning the Champions League. He is the best player I have played. After you, of course! Alonso moved to Madrid in the summer and says he is enjoying life under Pep Guardiola . Cristiano Ronaldo is the best player Alonso has played with during his stellar career . Alonso and Ronaldo (right) were once rivals playing for Liverpool and Manchester United . On a lack of understanding rather than technique letting English players down: Yes, for sure. When I was in Liverpool, I was reading the programme before a match one day. There was an interview with a 12-year-old from the Academy. He was asked what his main strengths were. His answer? Shooting and tackling. I said to myself 'OK but I don’t think the main quality of player should be tackling'. It must be something else. On what type of player can play holding midfield: You need someone who thinks 'what is best: Attack? Defence?' You have to know when to take two or three steps to make space, then you know you will be able to pass to someone between the lines. Players don’t have to move. Pep says this always to Mario Goetze (jumps up and starts pointing). 'You – don’t run! Stay there! The ball will come to you. Don’t move!' He shows clips to the team of Goetze standing still for 10 seconds. Pep works so much about the positional game. It is not about running everywhere. It is about you staying there and the others have to work to get it to you. On Carragher's view that Spain would win nothing: I know! I remember! What did you say? (puts on fake Liverpool accent) 'Spain? Spain! Can’t run! Can’t run!' You got the gold medal for the loudest player I played with. I remember at West Brom, in 2009. We are winning 2-0, the game is won and (Alvaro) Arbeloa tries to run the ball out of defence. He loses the ball. Next thing I hear: (jumps up) 'Eh! Eh! You! Arbeloa! You’re not Maradona!' Alonso enjoys scoring for Spain against France at Euro 2012 (left) and shielding the ball from Darren Fletcher . Carragher (left) and Alonso (second right) were part of Rafa Benitez's (centre) successful Liverpool team . Alonso and Carragher (left) team up to try to contain Didier Drogba in a Champions League game in 2005 . On Spain's success: When Sergio (Ramos)is on top of his game mentally, he’s the best. In midfield we had (David) Silva, Xavi, (Andres) Iniesta, myself. Playing with so many midfielders was our strength. We didn’t have great players in one-against-one situations. It took a lot of short passes to create the last chance. Then, when we did, we had David Villa and Fernando Torres, who were on top form. On his future after retiring (and the possibility of becoming a pundit): A pundit (more laughter)! Probably I will take my badges. I have lots of things in my mind. With the managers I have worked for, I have learned a lot. But there is another side. You cannot take that step too quickly. That part takes time. Would I walk away from football? Sometimes you think you need that break but you need something else.","Xabi Alonso talks to former Liverpool team-mate Jamie Carragher .

"Hull manager Steve Bruce believes Andy Robertson 'has the world at his feet' after his starring role against England. The 20-year-old left-back left Dundee United in the summer for a modest £2.85million and has rapidly become one of the rising stars of the Barclays Premier League. He has excelled in his early Tigers performances and earned a whole new level of exposure by starring for Scotland in the recent international break. Hull City's Andy Robertson celebrates after scoring Scotland's goal in 3-1 defeat to England . Tigers' boss Steve Bruce believes the 20-year-old can only get better after impressing for his country . Robertson celebrates with Charlie Mulgrew after victorious display against Ireland in Euro 2016 qualifier . Robertson was a stand-out performer in the 1-0 win over the Republic of Ireland and went on to score a fine goal in the friendly defeat by the old enemy on Tuesday. Admiring glances and lofty praise has followed in the wake of those performances, and Bruce was in no mood to downplay them ahead of Sunday's clash with Tottenham. 'He is a truly fantastic young talent who can only get better. He's a wonderfully gifted young lad who's got the world at his feet,' the Hull boss said. 'He's gone from playing second division football in Scotland to scoring a goal against England in a couple of years. A 20-year-old lad playing one-twos past England players and smashing it in the bottom corner - that will stay with him for a long time, being the proud Scot he is.' Having arrived at Hull with little immediate expectation, despite having a breakthrough season in the Scottish top flight behind him, Robertson's next challenge is living up to the added attention he has garnered in recent weeks. But, having been impressed by his character, Bruce has no fears on that front. 'It's our job to keep him working at it and improving and, if he does, we have one of the game's outstanding young players here at Hull,' he added. 'The next step is always difficult because of the expectation, but we're delighted with the way he's matured and developed. Bruce believes Hull have one of football's outstanding players in Robertson after . Robertson returned to his old school to support Tesco Bank's Community Programme . 'It's my job to make sure I keep his feet on the ground and we'll try and look after him as best as we can. 'He's sensible, he's dedicated and he has a wonderful future ahead of him - no question about it.' For his own part, Robertson is keen not to get carried away. It would be easy to do so, having been a part-timer with Queen's Park in as recently as 18 months ago and having spent just one season in the Scottish top division before Hull came calling. But, while others were quick to lavish him with praise, he was quick to point out areas he could still improve. 'It's been a massive rise for me, but you don't look back - you look forward,' he said. 'It meant a lot to score against England - it was called a friendly but it was far from it - but I could only enjoy it for a minute or two before (Wayne) Rooney made it 3-1 to seal the game. 'But really I was more disappointed with my defensive play. I would have swapped the goal for a clean sheet any day of the week. 'My game has definitely come on a lot, but there's plenty to improve on. 'I'm still working on the training ground, trying to get tips on the defensive side and practising crossing and picking people out. 'You're never the finished article - you've got to keep improving.'","Andy Robertson stood out in Scotland's ties against Ireland and England .

"Sunderland head coach Gus Poyet has ordered his troops not to be caught out at Leicester as they were after the last international break. A month ago, the Black Cats returned to Premier League action at Southampton having welcomed back players from their respective countries, and were trounced 8-0 in an horrific 90 minutes which cast a pall over what had been a relatively positive start to the season. This time around they head for the Walkers Stadium with the Uruguayan warning there is no room for a post-international hangover. Gus Poyet hopes Sunderland will avoid another post-international break trouncing against Leicester . Poyet will face off against Leicester manager Nigel Pearson for three points at the King Power Stadium . Poyet said: 'We have to make sure that we are much better than the previous game after the international break, if you know what I mean. 'There was a little bit of a reminder this morning to think about what we did last time we were internationals and to make sure we don't feel that way again, and that we forget as quickly as possible about the internationals and all the stories about the national teams and the travelling and think about Sunderland. 'That's the best way to come back. Close it, ""That's it, the internationals have finished until the next one in March, I'm not going to think about it now, I am fully focussed on Sunderland"".' The dark day on the south coast was followed by a 2-0 home defeat by Arsenal, but Sunderland have rather steadied the ship since, winning 3-1 at Crystal Palace before an eventful 1-1 draw with Everton last time out. The trip to Leicester is one they will view as an opportunity to extend that run against the promoted Foxes, who after a promising start to life in the top flight, have found the going a little tougher since. Southampton ran riot in an 8-0 victory over Sunderland after the last international break last month . Sunderland goalkeeper Vito Mannone had a nightmare that day at St Mary's Stadium . Nigel Pearson's men have taken just a single point from the last 18 on offer, although Poyet is convinced that return is not an accurate reflection of what they have to offer. He said: 'Normally when you finish the season in the Championship well, you normally start well because of the adrenaline and the craziness of having the chance to play there, and if one or two results go for you, you get a little bit longer. 'I think that's what happened to Leicester in the beginning. Everything was going well for them. But you can't maintain adrenaline for 25 games. You get one, two, three, four or whatever and then you just feel that you are a Premier League team. 'Then you need to maintain that, and that's when it's a little bit tougher. That's why it's maybe a little bit downhill at the moment. 'But I don't think there's a difference between Leicester and the rest of the bottom 10, there are ups and downs in there. Like any other manager, the sooner they get it up again, the better for them. 'Of course when they play against us, we will try not to let that happen, but I think that's what Nigel is going to be looking to, to use this game as a comeback to the feeling at the beginning of the season.' Sunderland forward Steven Fletcher should start the game after shaking off an ankle injury . Leonardo Ulloa will face Gus Poyet for the first time since they were together at Brighton . Poyet will be boosted by the return of midfielder Lee Cattermole from suspension, while striker Steven Fletcher has shaken off the ankle injury which promoted his early return from Scotland duty. But he will hope Pearson does not select his main frontman this weekend after seeing at close hand what Leonardo Ulloa is capable of during their time together at Brighton. Poyet signed the former Almeria striker January last and was not at all surprised when the Foxes took the £8million plunge 18 months later. He said: 'I am pleased he is doing well. I hope he doesn't play - if Nigel doesn't want him to play, I will be delighted. He's a special player.'","Gus Poyet orders Sunderland players not to be caught out at Leicester .

Coates also alleged defender Ryan Shawcross was receiving unfair treatment from officials, and criticised television pundit John Hartson for comments the former Wales international made regarding a perceived dive by Victor Moses in Stoke's 2-1 win over Swansea City in October. Coates has until November 24 to appeal the charges.","Peter Coates attracted controversy earlier this month when he backed Mark Hughes' criticism of referee Chris Foy .

"Mauricio Pochettino claims he has the full support of the Tottenham hierarchy despite their poor start to the season. The Argentine has held daily discussions with chairman Daniel Levy, with discomfort growing at Spurs over their situation in mid-table.

He said: ‘We need to be positive, but I understand the supporters at home are not happy. ‘The solution is just for us to play better on the pitch, to give our supporters the message we want to improve to get success. ‘I have a chat every day with (chairman) Daniel (Levy) on the training ground, that is normal.

"Southampton are preparing to offer England's man of the moment Nathaniel Clyne a new deal as part of a contract renewal drive. The Saints want to tie Clyne, as well as Morgan Schneiderlin and Jay Rodriguez, down to fresh contracts. Clyne and Rodriguez's deals expire at the end of next season and the south-coast club are understandably keen to secure the England duo's long-term futures. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Nathaniel Clyne on his England breakthrough . Southampton's Nathaniel Clyne has impressed for England and is set for a new Southampton contract . Clyne tackles Scotland's Johnny Russell during a stand-out performance at Celtic Park . Right back Clyne has been one of the club's star performers so far this season; his form culminating in his first two England caps against Slovenia and Scotland. The ex-Crystal Palace defender impressed in both matches, leading to calls for the 23-year-old to be installed as Roy Hodgson's first-choice right back. Southampton have long viewed Clyne as their long-term right back; their decision to sell Calum Chambers to Arsenal in the summer was testament to that. Clyne's first two England caps have come within a week against Slovenia and Scotland . The former Crystal Palace right back is now being touted as a possible first choice England player . Formal talks over a fresh terms are yet to begin, but the Saints intend to show their commitment to Clyne by initiating discussions in the coming weeks. Clyne is likely to attract interest from rival clubs next summer, with Liverpool understood to be monitoring his progress. But Southampton want to avoid any uncertainty over his future by signing the England international to an improved deal. Likewise, Southampton want Rodriguez to sign a new five-year contract as they seek to keep him from Tottenham's clutches in January. Mauricio Pochettino has made Rodriguez - who hasn't played since April due to a serious knee injury - a priority signing once the transfer window reopens. Morgan Schneiderlin is among high-flying Southampton stars the club is keen to make a fixture . Jay Rodriguez, who hasn't played since April, is top of Mauricio Pochettino's list at Tottenham . But the Saints want the striker to snub his former boss and commit to a new deal. Extending Schneiderlin's contract is not as urgent for Southampton given his current deal does not expire until the summer of 2017. Nevertheless, the France international will be offered an improved deal on his existing £30,000-per-week terms. Arsenal and Tottenham have both shown a firm interest in the 25-year-old, but Southampton hope they can persuade Schneiderlin to commit his future to the club he joined in 2008.","Nathaniel Clyne is set to receive a new contract off from Southampton .

"At the 11th attempt, Roy Hodgson appears to have stumbled upon a specialist right back to solve a nagging England problem. Not a massive problem, like a shortage of centre backs or total absence of defensive midfielders. There are plenty of Englishmen capable of operating at right back in the Barclays Premier League. But not all seem quite as comfortable in the job as Nathaniel Clyne did against Slovenia at Wembley. Southampton defender Nathaniel Clyne looked the part during his England debut at Wembley . UEFA officials forced Slovenia to take a bus to the stadium - even though they were staying at the Wembley Hilton 50 metres away. CLICK HERE to read the full story . It is not as if Clyne has been hidden from view. There was interest from Manchester United as he ran down his Crystal Palace contract and left Selhurst Park on a Bosman transfer in the summer of 2012. The United move did not materialise and he joined newly promoted Southampton. Hodgson has been a regular visitor to St Mary’s, selecting Rickie Lambert, Adam Lallana, Jay Rodriguez and Luke Shaw last season, but did not call up Clyne until every other option had been exhausted. Kyle Walker’s form suffered, even before his injury. Glen Johnson’s fitness became even less reliable than his defending and Hodgson has been searching for his successor. Centre backs Phil Jones and Chris Smalling have not appeared at ease in the role. John Stones and Calum Chambers are versatile but inexperienced and most likely to develop in other positions. Clyne, who impressed on his debut, claimed he just tried to play his 'normal game' against Slovenia . The English youngster has been in brilliant form for high-flying Southampton this season . Clyne is a natural right back. He is quick and mobile. He gets forward at the right times and recovers well. He is strong, likes to tackle and has positional awareness from learning the role over time. It was an impressive debut from a man who knew the job being asked of him. ‘I tried to play my normal game, as it’s my normal game that has got me this call-up,’ said Clyne. ‘I felt I did well. I enjoyed playing and I’m looking forward to playing more.’ Manchester United defender Chris Smalling (left) and Phil Jones have both had spells at right back . Hopefully he will. Hodgson considers himself a round-pegs-for-round-holes kind of guy, but it has taken him a long time to come round to Clyne. With Gary Neville, perhaps England’s last international-class right back, on his staff, you might think identifying the right man would be easy. You might think, after working at Fulham and West Brom, Hodgson would readily trust less fashionable clubs but he has rifled through Manchester United centre backs and Liverpool and Arsenal rookies before realising a 23-year-old from Southampton may be the answer. Glen Johnson has 54 England caps to his name, but failed to convince during the 2014 World Cup .","Roy Hodgson looks to have found his new England right back .

"West Brom boss Alan Irvine insists there is no point in Saido Berahino 'sulking' about his recent England snub. The in-form youngster was selected in Roy Hodgson's squad for the Euro 2016 qualifier against Slovenia and friendly against Scotland. However, he ended up kicking his heels on the bench for both games rather than getting his senior debut, with tried-and-tested veteran Rickie Lambert even preferred as a late substitute at Celtic Park. Saido Berahino and Ross Barkley watch England take on Slovenia from the substitutes bench at Wembley . Irvine believes Berahino will still benefit from the experience and hopes the forward reacts positively to the disappointment. 'There's certainly no benefit to sulking,' said the Baggies head coach. 'He has to look at the last two weeks as a great experience - one that helps him to become a better player. If that helps him to raise his game to another level, then fantastic. 'We will get the benefit of that and ultimately Saido will as well. 'It is vitally important he has learnt a lot in these last two weeks and that helps him make the progress he needs to continue to make. Berahino was called up to the national squad for the first time but didn't  make an appearance . Berahino's form for both England's U21 side and West Brom earned him the call-up . Alan Irvine said there was no point Berahino sulking . 'He knows he has a lot to do to continue to develop to become a regular at that level. I really hope this will give his season yet another boost.' Irvine has not had chance to gauge Berahino's mood since returning. 'I've not had time to have a chat with him yet,' said the Scot. 'He came back really pleased to have been away and looking hungry to continue his development. He may be disappointed that he did not get on but it will certainly benefit him. No question. 'It is vital he learns from the experience and that all helps him become even better and get even more of a taste of England in the future.' Asked whether Berahino's call-up will help convince the player his international ambitions can be achieved at a so-called smaller club and ultimately keep him at The Hawthorns, Irvine said: 'I am not sure if it strengthens it or not but it is certainly fantastic for the club and the lad. 'It is great for him to be recognised in this way, he needs to learn from the experience and become better. 'I cannot see any negatives at all about him going away and being a part of it - and that includes him not playing. 'He has had a couple of weeks of working with those players and living with those players and he would be missing an opportunity if he didn't take an awful lot from that.'","Saido Berahino was called up for the recent England squad for games against Slovenia and Scotland .

"West Ham beat PSV Eindhoven to keep their Premier League Under 21 International Cup ambitions alive as 15-year-old Reece Oxford captained his side to victory at Upton Park. It is something rarely seen in football that a schoolboy such as Oxford should lead a team made up of players in some cases four or five years older than him. But then it is increasingly apparent that Oxford, one of the best up-and-coming centre-halves in the youth game, is no ordinary teenager.

Referee: Alan Young . The Hammers are already fending off strong interest from the likes of Manchester United, Arsenal and Chelsea for the boy already being likened to another product of the east end club’s academy, Rio Ferdinand. Indeed, chairman David Sullivan went public a long time ago with his frustration that one of the Premier League’s big clubs could easily turn Oxford’s head and acquire him for a fee as paltry as £250,000. And so mature performances such as this one may have to be savoured by the West Ham faithful as they kept their chances of progressing to the knockout stage in this first edition of the International Cup. After Andjelo Rudovic had handed the Dutch visitors a third-minute lead, an unstoppable strike from Kieran Bywater and an assured finish from Kieran Sadlier turned the tables.

Sunderland . Celtic . Villarreal . This match failed to live up to the end-to-end excitement of West Ham’s first foray into this tournament last month, when Athletic Bilbao beat them 5-3 at the same venue, but it was a more favourable result. In the meantime, PSV had beaten Bilbao 1-0 and were therefore seeking to ensure their qualification as they arrived at the Boleyn on a crisp November night. And they enjoyed the perfect start when Andrija Lukovic controlled the ball in a dangerous area and teed up Rudovic to fire past West Ham keeper Raphael Spiegel. The Swiss stopper then showed great reflexes to thwart Rai Vloet at his near post while Oxford had to be alert to slide in and thwart Moussa Sanoh as PSV continued their positive start. Kieran Sadlier, scorer of the winning goal, vies for the ball (left), while Fanimo attempts a tackle (right) 15-year-old centre-back Oxford, pictured in August, captained West Ham's Under 21s on Wednesday night . Gradually, the hosts gained a foothold in the game and Ben Marlow connected well with a corner only to see his half-volley go wide of the post. And on 37 minutes, they gained an equaliser when Bywater found the top corner with a powerful shot from the edge of the area. Their parity was well deserved after a strong recovery from a shaky start. Indeed West Ham could have led before half-time but goalkeeper Jesse Bertrams saved first Sebastian Lletget’s shot on the turn and then Sadlier’s swerving effort from range. But they didn’t have to wait long after the break to gain their reward as Lletget split the PSV defence open and Sadlier ran through to finish well past Bertrams. PSV responded brightly to going behind and Lukovic rattled the post with Spiegel well beaten. West Ham retreated further and further back, taking every opportunity to break up the flow of the game. With 10 minutes left, Nasha’s wayward shot somehow found its way to Elvio van Overbeek, who was denied by a terrific Spiegel save. The Hammers managed to hold on through six minutes of added time to claim their first win in this competition and it will now all come down to their match with Fulham on December 8 to see if they can advance.","Reece Oxford captained West Ham Under 21s at the age of 15 .

"Scott Brown has closed the door on a possible move to England by pledging the next four years of his career to Celtic. With his present contract expiring in 2016, speculation was mounting that the 29-year-old may be tempted to explore avenues down south sooner rather than later. Crystal Palace were the latest side to be linked with the Fifer last week but Brown has now headed off any such moves at the pass by committing his future to Celtic until he turns 33. Celtic captain Scott Brown has signed a new deal keeping him at the club until the summer of 2018 . The 29-year-old has been at the club since 2007, when he joined the Scottish giants from Hibernian . Brown, who now looks set to end his playing days as a Celtic player, said: ‘It’s an absolute privilege to extend my contract with Celtic, a brilliant football club and with such incredible supporters. This is a place that I call home. ‘Being Celtic captain is a tremendous honour and it is a role which I cherish dearly. The team is in a great place just now and we’re all right behind the manager and the backroom team as they build for the future. ‘I will do all I can with the manager and all the players at the club to deliver the success which our supporters deserve.’ Celtic have previously been reluctant to offer bumper long-term deals to players approaching the age of 30 but they have made an exception in the case of the man who is also now skipper of Scotland. Brown is keen to pursue a coaching career and it’s understood the prospect of gaining such experience while still playing formed part of the contract negotiations. Brown talks to assistant manager and Scotland legend John Collins during a Celtic training session . National captains Brown and Wayne Rooney shake hands before the recent friendly at Celtic Park . The midfielder came through the ranks at Hibs and made his debut in 2002 before winning the League Cup with the Easter Road side in 2007. He moved to Celtic for £4.4million that summer and has gone on to make nearly 300 appearances for the club. After a sluggish start to life in green and white under Gordon Strachan, he has developed into an invaluable part of Ronny Deila’s side. The Norwegian feared Brown might miss much of his first season at Celtic when he was stretchered off in a pre-season friendly against Rapid Vienna, but the midfielder recovered from what proved to be a serious hamstring injury in just two months. In signing the new deal, he has given the clearest indication yet that he’s content with every aspect of life at Celtic. A winner of four Scottish Championships, two Scottish Cups and a League Cup in his time at Parkhead, Brown is now in line to complete 11 years’ service with the club – a rarity in the modern age. However, he will be watching from the stands when his team-mates host Dundee after being sent off against Aberdeen before the international break.","Celtic have tied down their captain Scott Brown until June 2018 .

"Stefan Johansen believes Celtic will continue to improve now they have worked out Ronny Deila's demands. The 23-year-old midfielder personifies the transformation in form at Parkhead from the start of the season when the Hoops struggled under his fellow Norwegian who, after taking over from Neil Lennon in the summer, came under intense scrutiny after two chances at qualifying for the Champions League were missed. Johansen, who played under Deila at Stromsgodset before moving to the Glasgow club in January, has arguably been Celtic's best player in recent months, playing in a more advanced role. Stefan Johansen believes the Hoops will continue to improve under Ronny Deila . His third goal in six games before the international break helped the champions to a 2-1 win at Aberdeen and meant the Hoops have lost only one of their last 15 matches. Ahead of the visit of Dundee on Saturday, the Norway international promised more improvement. 'I am enjoying my time, and starting to score goals in a kind of new role,' he said. 'There hasn't been anything wrong with my fitness or anything like that. Celtic have lost just once in their last 15 games under Deila at Parkhead . 'It took time with me and it takes time with the team. 'We are winning games and starting to create a lot of chances but I think we can be even better. 'At the start of the season we had a new gaffer who had new ideas. 'I think we are starting to see what he wants in the team. The players know what to do now so it is going to be easier and we are going to be better and better.' Johansen does not feel under any pressure to fill the boots of Kris Commons, out recently with a buttock injury, who scored 32 goals last season playing mostly in the same position behind the main striker. Johansen has been arguably Celtic's best performer so far this season . Speaking at the club's Lennoxtown training complex, where he was helping publicise the donation by Celtic FC Foundation of £50,000 to Unicef and War Child, he said: 'As an attacking midfielder you don't want to just score goals, you also want to create chances. 'But pressure? No. You have fun when you play football and the pressure I have, I put on myself. 'Obviously I am enjoying playing there but I think it is a good thing for me that I can play both positions. 'In the national team I play as a holding central midfielder but of course when you keep on scoring goals it is fun to play as an attacking midfielder.'","Hoops lost just once in their last 15 games before international break .

"Sam Allardyce has lamented the physical demands placed on his players as he faces up to being without two key players on Saturday. West Ham duo Diafra Sakho (back) and Stewart Downing (knee) are both doubts for the clash against Everton. The injuries were sustained whilst both players were on international duty, Downing with England and Sakho with Senegal. West Ham winger Stewart Downing had to substituted at half-time during England's win against Scotland . Striker Diafra Sakho was forced to missed Senegal's clash with Botswana because of a back injury . And Allardyce claims club managers are suffering because of the strains put on players. ‘The load of constant performance at the highest level takes it’s toll across the whole of the Premier League,’ said the Hammers boss. ‘The demand on the player is so great for so long, so often that eventually they are going to break down at some stage. ‘If you look at the load this year on players, it gets greater than ever before. Not only do they travel at international level across the world but the constant pressure of the Premier League is every getting faster and more demanding physically and mentally. ‘The time they have to rest is fewer and further between and that ultimately ends up with players never really recovering fully enough to go into the next game. Striker Andy Carroll is now fit to start for the Hammers after coming off the bench against Aston Villa . West Ham boss Sam Allardyce has bemoaned the injuries picked up by his players on international duty . ‘As hard as we try to prevent those injuries it is an impossibility by the demand on the players – and that demand comes because the player wants ever more money to play for you so it’s a vicious circle. ‘If the players’ demands came down then perhaps the demands to find more and more money wouldn’t be as great. Managing that situation is extremely difficult now.’ Meanwhile, Allardyce says there is still no resolution to central defender Winston Reid’s protracted contract talks. Reid is out of contract at the end of the season and could leave on a lucrative free contract in the summer. Allardyce said: ‘That’s an ongoing negotiation with the chairman to make a positive outcome for us. I think he [Reid] is comfortable here, but it’ll probably go down to money.

"As an acolyte of Ronny Deila’s at Stromsgodset, Stefan Johansen found himself the most sought-after man at Celtic Park when the name of Neil Lennon’s successor broke in the summer. A key member of the most unlikely team to win the Tippeligaen in 40 years 12 months ago, the midfielder was only too happy to lay it on thick when a string of inquisitors asked exactly what they could expect from the new man in charge. Tellingly though, whilst happy to eulogise about Deila’s strengths to anyone who cared to listen, Johansen stopped short of promising overnight miracles. No gain without pain might have been a neat summary of his view of the future. Stefan Johansen believes the Hoops will continue to improve under Ronny Deila . Accordingly, when Celtic fumbled their way through the first three months of the season, Johansen felt no need to correct himself. Provided his team-mates continued to buy into the new man’s methods, he remained convinced his long-term prediction would hold true. ‘It always takes time to adapt to a new culture but I think he’s starting to get there,’ said Johansen. ‘At the start of season we didn’t get the results we wanted. I said at the time, though, it was always going to take time with the new gaffer. He had new ideas he wanted to put into the team and you’re starting to see the team he wants. We are getting results and are still in every cup while being at the top of the league. We’re doing well in the Europa League as well and, hopefully, we can get through there. Celtic have lost just once in their last 15 games under Deila at Parkhead . ‘Things are starting to look good now but it’s still early in the season and we need to keep it going. ‘Things were tough at the start but I don’t think anyone had a problem sticking with him. He was talking to us all during that time. It’s going to be good in the end. Like I say, just give him time. Celtic is going to be a success with him as manager.’ That statement is much easier to swallow now than at any stage in Deila’s tenure to date. Few would have dared to have muttered it aloud after the debacles that were Legia, Maribor and Hamilton but, with each passing week, matters have improved incrementally. However, looking back on some of those grim affairs, it’s instinctive to ask Johansen if his fellow Norwegian told him to do a little dressing-room politicking on his behalf. ‘He didn’t ask me to do that,’ he stonewalled. ‘He did well in Norway and doesn’t have any problem explaining what he wants here. He’s very clear on that — he doesn’t need me to do that. He’s fully capable of doing that by himself.’ Only 39, Deila is distinct from the battle-hardened figures like Martin O’Neill and Gordon Strachan who have occupied the dugout in recent times. Like Lennon, he is having to learn much on the job. The burden at times must feel overwhelming and yet Johansen can testify that time spent with him is not devoid of moments of levity. ‘He’s a serious guy when he needs to be but he’ll also make some jokes,’ he said. ‘The important thing is he’s got a good mix — in training today we needed a hard session after coming back from the international break. But of course, sometimes he will make a joke or something. That’s good. Sometimes you need to have a laugh. You can’t be serious all the time. ‘Maybe sometimes people forget he’s so young. But that’s the kind of pressure we have at the club. ‘It doesn’t matter if you are a player of 18 or 27, the expectation is the same.’ Johansen has been arguably Celtic's best performer so far this season . While victory at Pittodrie last time out was the most impressive domestic result of Deila’s reign to date, his reaction eclipsed anything that’s happened on the field of play. Previously sedate to the point where his passion was being questioned, Deila’s fist-pumping and roars of approval to the visiting throng went down every bit as well as Virgil van Dijk’s late winner. Not quite the striptease he famously performed in front of the Godset fans after saving them from relegation — but scenes of unity and joy so far conspicuous by their absence since he came to Glasgow. ‘You can see the game meant a lot to him,’ Johansen added. ‘Like everyone else at Celtic, he wants to be at the top of the table. The Aberdeen game was the last game before the international break and our chance to get on top. ‘With the way we won the game, with one man down (after Scott Brown’s dismissal), it was great. ‘We kept on going and, when Virgil scored the winner near the end, it was a fantastic feeling. The game wasn’t so good, we didn’t play to our best but winning was a good feeling for everybody.’ Rest assured, that the unbridled emotion of that day was quickly replaced by a steely resolve for improvement. Johansen can testify to the fact that, irrespective of a scoreline, Deila’s desire for individual and collective improvement is bordering on the obsessive. ‘He is always saying things to me because he always looks for improvement,’ he said. ‘He does that with all the players — especially when you are doing well. He wants you to do even better every day. That’s how it should be. You can never be satisfied or good enough in football. That’s what he’s aiming for in everyone and himself. Ronny Deila is having to learn much on the job like predecessor Neil Lennon . ‘For example, when I played in Stromsgodset, I created chances but he told me I needed to work on my defence and be smarter in where I ran. It was always a couple of small things — small details. That’s what makes you a better player.’ Those who are determined to become the best they can be will thrive under him. Those who stand still will be discarded. Evidently not a man who plays favourites, previous relationships count for nothing in the here and now. ‘I speak with him in English when all the players are around,’ said Johansen. ‘They wouldn’t understand what we were saying otherwise. If I talk with him alone, I can talk in Norwegian, but, if there’s anyone else there, I will talk in English. It’s out of respect for the other players and the rest of the staff. If they want to be part of the conversation, that’s the way it should be.’ Increasingly, in more ways than one, Deila and his players are speaking the same language. Talk of a Treble has never been far from the manager’s lips, a view heartily endorsed by Johansen. ‘Yes he mentions it to us,’ the midfielder said ahead of tomorrow’s visit of Dundee. ‘We all know the expectation that comes with being a player at Celtic. ‘The fans want us to win trophies and that’s what we want as well. That’s why we are Celtic players — to want to win every trophy. We still have the chance of success as we are in every cup. ‘If we keep winning we will win those trophies. I know how hard it is — but it’s still possible.’ The Celtic Foundation have presented both UNICEF and War Child with cheques for £25,000 as a result of money raised during September’s Maestro Charity Weekend.","Hoops lost just once in their last 15 games before international break .

"Pace on the pitch and patience among the paying public. Will that be enough to see off the proven winners in hot pursuit? A nation awaits the answer. The lunchtime clash between the top two in Scotland’s second tier is of interest far beyond the core supports of either Hearts or Rangers; events in Gorgie will provide a focal point, taking point and – almost certainly – starting point for arguments and opinions the length and breadth of the country. Heck, the debate surrounding the respective merits of the Championship challengers has already started. And it does rather feel as if the weight of opinion is veering strongly towards the home side at Tynecastle. Hearts, who are  currently six points clear at the top of the Scottish Championship, face Rangers on Saturday . Shortly after seeing both protagonists up close, Jimmy Nicholl made a snap judgment to declare Hearts the more dominant and potent force. He qualifies that a little now, pointing out that his Cowdenbeath team had faced the Jambos in Edinburgh while Rangers had toughed it out in the dreich surroundings of Central Park. For all his talk of the quality available to Rangers, though, Nicholl still seems to be leaning towards a home win – for reasons beyond touch, technique and tactics. The former Rangers and Manchester United player, who likens the fixture to the winner-takes-all Old Firm ‘title deciders’ of old, told Sportsmail: ‘The pace of Hearts is really something. ‘But I’ll tell you another factor. Something more important. Do you know, we were drawing one each with Hearts at half-time, Cowdenbeath against a team flying high, a team expected to batter us – and they weren’t booed off the pitch at half-time. ‘Out of all the games that we’ve played, that’s the one that stuck with me. The Hearts fans wouldn’t even think of booing their team at 1-1 at half-time against Cowdenbeath, bottom of the league with one point. ‘Hibs were booed when we went 2-1 up with half an hour to go. People were walking out. So I think it’s a massive thing that the Hearts supporters are sticking with them, irrespective of how the game is going. ‘It’s because they’re young bucks, they’re playing with enthusiasm. The fans are just saying: “Away you go, give it everything – we’re right behind you”. Ally McCoist's side drew their last game but won eight consecutive matches before that . ‘Supporters are entitled to boo. Hearts fans would have every right to boo their team off at 1-1 against us. But they didn’t do it. ‘I think that’ll be a major plus for the Hearts players because, as the season goes on, there will be nervous and anxious times, fighting to be top of the league. The fact that those fans seem willing to stick with them is a great thing for the players.’ All the understanding in the world, of course, isn’t worth more than a goal-scoring striker or a solid defence. In pure football terms, it would be utterly daft to write off a Rangers team who had put together an eight-game winning run before last weekend’s slip-up at home to Alloa. ‘Out on the park, Hearts have the pace to hurt you - they do have more pace than Rangers,’ said Nicholl. ‘But you know it takes different ways to win a football match. People say: “Oh, Rangers don’t have the pace of Hearts”. Yeah but they still went on that long winning run and they could still be only three points behind after this weekend. ‘It doesn’t matter, we’ve all got different styles, different players and different types. Do Hearts give you more problems than Rangers do? Yes. But they’re different problems.’ Hearts boss Robbie Nielson's (left) side have only lost one Championship game all season . Two men previously prolific in a Rangers shirt were recruited in the summer to help provide the goals required to win promotion. While Kenny Miller (four) and Kris Boyd (two) have yet to set the Championship alight following their returns to Ibrox, Nicholl insists the duo are still playing their part for Ally McCoist’s men. ‘Rangers have Boyd and Miller, and a good way of using them,’ he continued. ‘Hearts have good players with pace – it’s two different styles. ‘For me, I know Boyd and Miller aren’t the way they used to be. I know that. But the threat is always there. ‘Can you deal with that? You try – but you can’t take away from their quality. Give them half a yard and they’ll finish. ‘It’s OK to say they’re maybe not the players they were. You can’t avoid the fact that they’ll punish any lapse in concentration. It’s also hard to score goals against Rangers. ‘Rangers were on an unbeaten run of eight games before they drew at home to Alloa, which was a surprise to everybody. ‘Do Hearts look like they’re going to drop points at home to the likes of us or some of the other boys? You would say no. ‘But then you would have expected Rangers to beat Alloa, having been in great form.’ Kris Boyd (left) and Kenny Miller have both returned to Rangers but are not the players they once were . With six points between the clubs currently, a victory for either on Saturday would be significant. Hearts have the momentum after last weekend but Nicholl is aware that such things can be fleeting. ‘Rangers could win on Saturday and that changes everything,’ he said. ‘The boys asked me after Rangers beat us 3-0 at our place, what did I think (about who the better was). I had to say Hearts, because they were the most convincing winners against us. ‘We were still in the game with Rangers at half-time, we scored an own goal in the second half and then they made it three. But we were in it. ‘Hearts beat us 5-1 and really dominated us. From the three of them, including Hibs, Hearts have been the most convincing. ‘But what I have said, and will say again, is that Hearts haven’t been to Cowdenbeath yet! Seriously, it’s OK them beating us 5-1 at their place. I can make a better assessment after both teams have been to us. ‘I would like to assess the two of them properly after they’ve been to Cowdenbeath, because we know it’s a difficult place for away teams. Sam Nicholson celebrates one of his side's goals during their 5-1 win against Dumbarton . ‘If they are as convincing as they were in the second half at Tynecastle, then I would say Hearts are definitely the top team. ‘The wee boy Dale Carrick came off the bench for Hearts in the second half against us. Off the bench! And he scored two against us.’ Arguments over who is the better side at least have the potential to be settled – if only temporarily – at a stroke tomorrow. As for what the result means to the title race, well, there is a strong argument to say that Rangers, having lost at home to Hearts early in the season, can’t afford to surrender more ground to their rivals. ‘I look at this Championship and say it’s like when Rangers and Celtic were in the SPL,’ said Nicholl. ‘If the two of them were there, one of them was always going to win it. ‘That’s why the big emphasis was on the results between them. OK, they would drop points during the season to the like of Aberdeen and Dundee United, both teams did that, but the title would be settled on the results between each other. ‘Now, Hearts have already beaten Rangers. And they’ve beaten them at Ibrox. Does that mean they’ll go on to win the league? ‘I think it’s going to be between the two of them, which means the results between the sides will be vital. ‘That makes this weekend really important, especially if Rangers go nine points behind. That’s a lot to catch up. ‘It’s definitely Scotland’s game of the day, no doubt. That was going to happen this season, wasn’t it? It’ll be great.’","Hearts and Rangers face each other in the on Saturday .

"It once seemed as though the stories at Rangers and Hearts were twinned. Under the respective regimes of Craig Whyte and Vladimir Romanov, both clubs endured high-profile turmoil. Both amassed substantial debts and both plunged into administration. It was then, however, that the tales diverged. Regardless of the on-field outcome on Saturday, you have to think Rangers fans are looking eastwards with a sense of envy. Rangers remain in turmoil, despite Charles Green's consortium's asset purchase at Ibrox . Two years and five months after Charles Green’s consortium completed an asset purchase at Ibrox, this institution of Scottish sport remains mired in discord. Trust between the fanbase and those in charge is somewhere between scant and non-existent. League attendances have dipped below 30,000. Redundancies have taken place within administrative staff. The financial situation is perilous. Mike Ashley has provided a loan to assume effective control, but Rangers have admitted more money will be needed before the end of the year. No one has yet spelled out a longer-term vision for the future. Added to that, the team is currently six points adrift of a Hearts side assembled on a significantly smaller budget. That view from the summit of the Championship is not the only thing for Tynecastle season-ticket holders to enjoy right now. Newcastle owner Mike Ashley has provided a loan to Rangers . Thanks to the financial backing of businesswoman Ann Budge, the club emerged from administration with a credible strategy for fan ownership. Budge’s intentions are clear. To fund a CVA for the Foundation of Hearts, she stumped up £2.5million which will be paid back through the on-going contributions of rank-and-file supporters. Budge intends to fill the role of chairperson for between three and five years, by which point it is hoped £6m will have been raised and the club will be in full fan ownership. That precious commodity of trust seems in fulsome supply around Gorgie. Supporters have reacted positively to further moves from the new regime, such as introducing a living wage for all staff. A museum within Tynecastle has also been mooted. There has been a re-connection between those in the stands, those in the boardroom and those in the changing room. The contrast with Rangers is profound. Clearly, the very different ways in which the clubs handled administration set their future patterns. Paul Goodwin, formerly of Supporters Direct Scotland, was a community ownership middle man between the previous Lithuanian owners at Tynecastle and Foundation of Hearts. Like many, he sees a great opportunity lost where Rangers are concerned. The financial situation at Ibrox is perilous and the team are six points adrift of Championship leaders Hearts . ‘From the start of the process at Rangers and the start of the process at Hearts, the similarities were there,’ he said. ‘The biggest difference was the appointment of the administrators. ‘Hearts brought in Bryan Jackson, who knows and understands community ownership and was involved with Dunfermline, Hearts and Portsmouth. He believes it is more than the numbers that matter at a club. ‘It’s also about the heart and soul of the club, which rests in the community. ‘The sad thing for Rangers was that they had a far bigger community than Hearts and didn’t tap into it. That came down to the administrator. ‘Part of the administrator’s duty is to make sure that when he leaves that business it has a long-term strategy to survive. Robbie Neilson has got off to a storming start after taking over at Tynecastle . ‘Did that happen at Rangers after Duff & Phelps left? The answer is no. There was not a succinct, rock-solid business plan that would make the future secure. ‘Had the Rangers fans galvanised and got together at that time then, with an administrator like Bryan Jackson, that could have happened. ‘Bryan took a more holistic approach to the welfare of Hearts. He had other bids that were higher, but didn’t want to take the risk. The Foundation of Hearts demonstrated, via their 8,500 supporters, that there was an ongoing willingness to work with business people hand in hand. That is the perfect marrying of models.’ The clear-eyed planning has extended beyond finance. On her first day of control, Budge authorised a ruthless series of cuts to the playing and coaching staff. It was brutal and unquestionably painful for some of those involved. But it made for a clean break. Appointing Craig Levein as director of football and Robbie Neilson as head coach has delivered swift dividends. The partnership between director of football Craig Levein and head coach Neilson has worked well . It’s still too early in the season for definite predictions of success, but the signings made have improved and galvanised an existing core of talented youngsters. Neilson has taken a first senior coaching role in his stride, often delivering vibrant football. Levein is on hand to provide shrewd counsel. ‘Your driving model has to be the sustainability of the club,’ added Goodwin. ‘What Rangers has never had since 2012 is a sustainable business model. ‘They were signing players on £7,000 a week and it was insanity. There was no need to spend what they did coming up through the leagues. They have frittered away vast sums of fans’ money. ‘Then there is the money used by the various owners for their own ends to the detriment of the club. ‘This is where Hearts have got it absolutely spot-on. They will not be spending more money than they bring in. ‘It’s basic, but the added investment in the club is coming purely from contributions from the 8,500 fans who see where their money goes. ‘They know what it is providing when their direct debit goes in on the 20th of the month.’","Rangers are in turmoil, despite takeover by Charles Green's consortium .

"John Greig, the man officially recognised as the greatest living Ranger, fell victim to a harsh, brutal truth when the curtain fell on his managerial career. Greig was — is — a Rangers icon. He captained club and country. He led the Ibrox club to a European trophy *and* holds the record for league appearances, playing 496 games and scoring 120 goals while playing primarily in defence. He captured three domestic trebles, was Scotland’s Player of the Year twice and received an MBE for services to football in 1977. John Greig (left) was Scotland captain in 1967 for their famous victory over England at Wembley Stadium . Greig was sacked by Rangers, so Ally McCoist (left) knows that no-one is safe from the chop . Yet, in the end, none of this could protect him from the unsentimental realities of managing Rangers. Greig won two Scottish Cups and two League Cups. But in October 1983, with Dundee United champions and Aberdeen having triumphed in Europe, he was unceremoniously sacked. Ally McCoist knows this period of Ibrox history well. A Greig signing, he lived and breathed it. At times his own survival, in the early days at least, was seat-of-the-pants stuff. McCoist knows more than most that no one – not even the greatest living Ranger – is safe from the sack. He admitted as much after a 3-1 home defeat to Hibernian last month. That result left Hearts six points clear at the top of the Championship. A gap which has remained stubbornly hard to bridge in the weeks since. McCoist applauds the Rangers fans at the end of a match earlier this season . Greig is such an Ibrox legend that he has a statue in his honour outside the stadium . ‘I don’t think anyone is bombproof,’ said McCoist then. ‘I wouldn’t sit here for a minute and say I’m bombproof. I’m still wearing the flak jacket but nobody is bombproof.’ For that reason Saturday’s league meeting with Hearts already has the look of a defining day for the current manager. McCoist would be as close as anyone to Greig in the affections of the fans. But Mike Ashley, the new power on the throne, is no Rangers supporter. The Ibrox manager already agreed to slash his salary in half but must still subscribe to the Sports Direct ethos. Value for money. Or else. A Rangers victory would reduce the lead of the Tynecastle club to three points and rank as one of the most important, critical victories of a managerial career which, so far, has been patchy and open to scrutiny. Former Rangers and Hearts striker Kevin Kyle expressed a commonly-held view when he tipped a doggedly consistent Hearts side, free of off-field strife, to take all three points. ‘The pressure is all on Rangers but I have to fancy Hearts,’ said Kyle. ‘They have shown consistency since the season started. They’re the team full of confidence.’ McCoist (left) jokes with his assistant manager Kenny McDowall during training at Murray Park . McCoist looks on as his Rangers side played a pre-season friendly agaisnt Derby County in August . If he’s right, the margin at the top of the table becomes an awkward nine points. Their finances precarious and predicated on returning to the Premiership as soon as possible, the chances of Rangers doing so at the first time of asking would diminish. McCoist’s position, bluntly, would come under intense scrutiny. Amidst widespread assumptions Rangers can’t afford to pay off the one-year rolling contract of their manager if they were to dispense with him, a new question would arise. Could they possibly afford to keep him? McCoist, an eternal optimist, believes he is the man for the job and has been here before. He knows the score. ‘You are only as good as your last pass here,’ he told the club website. ‘I probably know the club better than most and it goes with the territory. ‘The one thing about being a Rangers player and being involved with Rangers is that there is always the next game to make amends for a disappointment.’ The evidence they can do so is patchy. An eight-game run of steady, improving results suggested this was a team turning a corner at the right time. Greig scored the winning goal for Scotland against Italy in a World Cup 1966 Qualifying encounter . McCoist (left) shakes the hand of Kris Boyd as he is substituted . Yet last weekend’s 1-1 draw with Alloa, a dismal affair, prompted fury in a crowd of almost 30,000. Amidst an ongoing off-field circus, a never-ending procession of furious, arcane statements issued by a cast list of unreliable, largely discredited characters, the level of support has remained a modern marvel. The people continue to turn up despite a fresh call this week from former director Dave King for supporters to starve out the current board. Amongst those who do stay away, the football being played is often cited as a factor. The status of McCoist the player with supporters will never be damaged. In 15 spectacular years, he was top scorer in nine of them. The club’s all-time highest scorer with 355 goals in 581 games, he played through the nine-in-a-row era. But as manager the jury remains out. His wit and personality makes McCoist a popular figure. Turning on the man does not come easy to supporters. Taking pot shots at Santa would be preferable to some. ‘Ally has a lot of credit in the bank left over from his playing days,’ confirmed Drew Roberton of the Rangers Supporters Association. ‘He left us with an awful lot of great memories and those won’t be erased. But it’s sad that a dream job for him has come along in these circumstances.’ Such circumstances are clear enough. The off-field travails of Rangers are an ongoing soap opera. McCoist has risked criticism for publicly backing the chief executives who have come and gone, lining their pockets en route, but retains a level of gratitude for his actions when the club lurched into administration in 2012. ‘I think, during very difficult times, he has kept the club afloat and he deserves enormous credit for the way he has done that,’ added Roberton. ‘I believe that the vast majority of fans are grateful for the way Ally conducted himself during that period. ‘He steered the club through some difficult years. He was the finger in the dyke at that time. ‘He was left with a club which, for a spell, was a rudderless ship for a few months.’ Reporters who flocked to Murray Park that February week still recall the McCoist’s car shuttling in and out of the training ground’s wrought iron gates for meetings with administrators. Most football managers, mercifully, will be spared the nonsense he has had to involved himself with. His job description has often gone far beyond standard terms and conditions. A transfer embargo and dismal finances made free transfers a must. Even so, wages of £7,000 for some top team players in the lower reaches of the SPFL struck many as a poor use of resources. McCoist justified the cost by setting his sights on taking Rangers back to the top as quickly as possible. Player expense has not been the biggest problem. But there would still be irony in Hearts — another club mired in financial turmoil — beating the Glasgow giants back to the top with a team of kids. ‘With Hearts being six points in front, I think it’s fair to say the game is perhaps more significant to Rangers than it is to them,’ observed Roberton. For Ally McCoist, a man defined by his Rangers achievements, its significance can hardly be overstated.","John Greig is a Rangers icon, but was sacked in October 1983 .
For that reason, Ally McCoist knows no-one is safe from the chop .
Greig holds the record for league appearances with 496 Rangers games .
McCoist's side are currently unable to oust Hearts from the top of the Scottish Championship - the team they face on Saturday ."
"From one of the world’s greatest fighters who is on a missionary visit to the Far East to a very local lad bearing a grudge in Liverpool, this is the first hectic weekend of boxing’s new winter season. Manny Pacquiao will try to put a potential billion dollar fight with Floyd Mayweather out of his mind so as to concentrate on beating American challenger Chris Algieri in Macau. Defeat for the PacMan in a catch-weight defence of his world welterweight title against a little-known light-welter champion would be a disaster commercially as well as for his legacy. With talks reportedly on-going with Mayweather for the mega event the world has been waiting so long to see, this is a fight Pacquiao cannot afford to lose. Manny Pacquiao (left) prepares for bout with Chris Algieri of the USA in Macau this weekend . Not with his promoter Bob Arum striving to open up the huge Chinese boxing market to its first pay-per-view fight. Not that he is likely to be beaten. Arum will be anxious that China’s own boxing idol, three-time world amateur champion and double Olympic gold medallist Zou Shiming, wins as well. Shiming’s success is the key to persuading the Beijing government to permit subscription television for his fights. Expect him to prevail, also. Amusingly, against a Thai flyweight who looks so much like Pacquiao that they call him Mini-Manny. Another, even greater, ex-amateur finds himself on this bill in the remarkable position of defending a world title in only his third professional fight. Ukraine’s Vasyl Lomachenko takes on a Thai who, with 52 wins from his 53 fights, comes from the opposite end of the boxing spectrum. Earlier on Merseyside, Tony Bellew angrily seeks home-town revenge for his previous defeat by former light-heavyweight world champion Nathan Cleverly. Nathan Cleverly and Tony Bellew continued their hostilities at the weigh-in on Friday afternoon . The hostile build-up, brilliantly stage-managed by promoter Eddie Hearn, has elevated a fight between two men who were each knocked out in recent world title fights into a pay-per-view Battle of Britain on Sky Sports television. Some selling job, this. However, this is a competitive match-up in its own right. It is also a good mix of styles between Bellew the slugger from the streets and Cleverly the stylist with a university degree in mathematics. Bellew’s hunger for redemption should make him more dangerous this time around and Cleverly will need to have recovered his appetite for boxing if he is to repeat his victory and be the one moving on towards a world cruiser-weight title bid. George Groves may be given a sharp work-out by Denis Douglin in his latest come-back fight from that devastating Wembley Stadium KO by Carl Froch. The rest of the starry cast-list on Hearn’s packed promotion – including Scott Quigg and Jamie McDonnell in WBA title defences - should improve their records with victories ranging from comfortable to one-sided.

"QPR boss Harry Redknapp believes Mike Ashley has been a 'fantastic' chairman for Newcastle and claims Alan Pardew would have been sacked by now under a foreign owner. Ashley has endured a turbulent relationship with Newcastle supporters, who have criticised the billionaire's off-field appointments, the renaming of St James' Park and a lack of investment in new players since he bought the club in 2007. The Sports Direct owner also remained loyal to Pardew during a difficult start to the season and the manager has repaid his chairman's faith, leading the Magpies to five consecutive victories. Mike Ashley has been a 'fantastic' chairman for Newcastle, claims QPR boss Harry Redknapp . Redknapp is set to take his side to face Newcastle at St James's Park on Saturday . 'The chairman has been fantastic,' said Redknapp, whose QPR side play Newcastle on Saturday. 'He gets a lot of stick, Mike Ashley, but he's always at the games in the crowd. 'He follows the team, loves it, and has stuck by Alan because he knows he's got a good manager. 'It's easy to make a knee-jerk reaction and bomb him out. 'They finished fifth the other year and were very unlucky not to finish in the Champions League places - he's done a good job.' Many Newcastle supporters called for Pardew to be sacked after a miserable start to the campaign but wins over Tottenham, Manchester City and Liverpool have transformed the mood in the north-east. Pardew was handed an eight-year contract in December 2012 but Redknapp insists the long-term deal will not be the reason behind Ashley's loyalty. 'It doesn't really matter if you've got a contract - there will be a clause in it and 99 times out of 100, if they sack you that will probably pay you a year's money,' Redknapp said. Alan Pardew would have been sacked by now by a foreign owner, according to Redknapp . 'The difference is probably because he's a British owner. 'Lots of the foreign owners would look at bringing a foreign manager in because maybe he's been a better player than Alan Pardew was and they played in Italy or Spain. 'But Ashley has stuck by him and no matter what abuse he gets he doesn't care, does he? 'That's why he's such a clever man - you don't become that wealthy if you're not a clever man.' Redknapp turned down the chance to become Newcastle manager in 2008, opting instead to remain at Portsmouth, where he won the FA Cup later that year. 'I was offered the job but I just couldn't get my Geordie accent right,' Redknapp joked. 'No I don't regret anything, I don't look back, I look forward and move on. 'I went to Spurs and had four fantastic years and I don't regret staying at Pompey where I had a great time. 'And I don't regret being here, I have loved it here. I'm very lucky to keep going.'","Harry Redknapp believes Mike Ashley has been 'fantastic' for Newcastle .

"Champions Paris St Germain went top of Ligue 1 for the first time this season when Ezequiel Lavezzi's late goal earned a 3-2 win at Metz on Friday, the club's first victory there in 11 years. The Argentine forward struck seven minutes from time to give PSG 30 points from 14 games, two ahead of Marseille who take on Bordeaux on Sunday.

Scorers: Pastore 9', Bussmann 16′ (og), Lavezzi 83' PSG were 2-0 up after 16 minutes following Javier Pastore's opener and Gaetan Bussmann's own goal but they conceded two penalties in four minutes early in the second half, both converted by Modibo Maiga, who is on loan from West Ham. Argentine midfielder Pastore flicked the ball past Cedric Carrasso at the end of a sharp counter attack to put PSG ahead after nine minutes. Seven minutes later Bussmann deflected Lavezzi's free kick into his own net with his knee. PSG coach Laurent Blanc had to make an early substitution when Yohan Cabaye limped off and he was replaced by Clement Chantome. Maiga reduced the arrears four minutes into the second half after Siargai Krivets was brought down by Adrien Rabiot. Metz then benefited from another successful Maiga penalty after Gregory van der Wiel handled before Lavezzi rounded off his man-of-the-match performance with his late goal to give unbeaten PSG their fifth league win in a row. 'We played well in the first half and followed the coach's instructions,' PSG midfielder Rabiot told BeIn Sports television. 'It was more complicated in the second half because of the substitutions.' PSG midfielder Yohan Cabaye picked up a calf injury in the 20th and was replaced by Blaise Matuidi. At halftime, Italy international Thiago Motta was also substituted.

"Newcastle boss Alan Pardew has urged people not to label striking sensation Ayoze Perez after a stunning start to his career in England. The 21-year-old Spaniard has scored three times in as many Barclays Premier League games, including winners against both Tottenham and Liverpool, to draw comparisons with Geordie heroes such as Alan Shearer and Andy Cole. However, while he has been delighted with the youngster's contribution to date, he is determined not to pile the pressure on him as he prepares to unleash him on QPR this Saturday. Ayoze Perez scores with an exquisite back-heel against West Brom in Newcastle's last Premier League game . Perez celebrates his goal against West Brom as Newcastle go on to record a fifth straight win . Pardew said: 'At the moment, he's fearless. He's got the wind in his sails and is going along very nicely. He's been very sharp in training. He's a threat. 'If you take your eye off him, he's a predator. I'm sure QPR will be having conversations of how to look after him. He's difficult to pin down, his movement is very clever. 'But he is a young player. Some of the headlines have been way off the mark - the new Alan Shearer, the new Andy Cole. 'This is a boy who has played three games. Those players are legends and have done it all. Ayoze is just setting foot in the Premier League. Perez scored the only goal of the game as Newcastle beat Liverpool at St James' Park in November . The 21-year-old is congratulated by Rolando Aarons after scoring the winning goal against Liverpool . 'But I have to say, he's done really well so far. I'm pleased with him.' Perez, a £1.5million summer signing from Tenerife, has got his chance because of an injury to Papiss Cisse with the Magpies having decided not to sign a big-name frontman during the close-season. He was seen as a player for the future, but the impact he has made to date has been remarkable after settling in with a little help from skipper Fabricio Coloccini. Pardew said: 'He's a nice, bright boy. Because of the language, Colo has taken him under his wing. That's helped him settle quickly. 'He's a smashing player and is low-maintenance. We're enjoying him on the training ground.' Perez is mobbed by his team-mates as they celebrate in front of the Newcastle fans during the Liverpool win . The Spaniard also scored the winner as Newcastle beat Tottenham 2-1 at White Hart Lane in October . If Pardew has found a solution at one end of the pitch, he is having to be inventive at the other end too with Coloccini definitely sidelined by a calf problem this weekend and Steven Taylor also struggling. As a result, left-back Paul Dummett will line up the in the middle once again alongside the fit-again Mike Williamson, and his manager will have no qualms about him doing so. He said: 'He's been a player that the fans were slow to respond to. For us, we've always felt he had a massive chance because of his defensive abilities. They've really come to the fore in this run, either at left-back or centre-back. Fabricio Coloccini, pictured challenging Erik Lamela, is out of Saturday's clash against QPR with a calf injury . 'He's got a tough job on Saturday. He will play centre-back and will be up against two strikers really on their game. This will be a big test for him. 'But I'm not going to lose any sleep over it, I'm confident he can deal with it, and I couldn't pay him a higher tribute than that.' Pardew also moved to address claims from South America that midfielder Jonas Gutierrez had been told to find another club after being diagnosed with testicular cancer. Paul Dummett is likely to partner Mike Williamson in the centre of defence against QPR . The 31-year-old is due back on Tyneside within the next few weeks after winning his battle, and the manager insists he will be welcomed with open arms. He said: 'It's difficult, when you've said to a player to get a new club and unfortunately the illness has come. 'You try to be supportive, but of course, the player wants to find a bit more assurance than that. 'But that decision was a 100 per cent football decision. I want to invite Jonas back and give him the best possible chance when he returns.'","Ayoze Perez joined Newcastle from Tenerife in the summer for £1.5m .

"Craig Whyte is facing jail after a second warrant for the arrest of the former Rangers owner was issued by a High Court judge. The businessman, already wanted by Police Scotland for questioning concerning his 2011 takeover of the club, was due to appear at the Royal Courts of Justice in London where Ticketus are pursuing a separate action over his role in the Ibrox meltdown. Mr Justice Newey charged Whyte with contempt of court after he failed to appear for the hearing – with a custodial order of 28 days attached to the warrant. Craig Whyte (centre) is facing jail after a High Court judge issued an arrest warrant for him . Earlier this week the Motherwell-born financier vowed to surrender to police and assist officers investigating the Rangers takeover, saying: ‘I will return to Britain at the beginning of December and hand myself in for questioning.’ If he does come back, Whyte will now be arrested and faces a potential four-week custodial sentence. Following the hearing a spokeswoman for Ticketus said: ‘Today’s court hearing is part of Ticketus’ continued activity to enforce its judgement of April 2013 for damages of £17.7million plus interest and costs against Craig Whyte as it looks to recover funds for its investors. ‘This reflects the total amount Ticketus invested through the ticket purchase agreement it entered into with Rangers Football Club under Craig Whyte’s ownership. Whyte watching Rangers play at Ibrox in 2011 and (right) meeting fans before a game . Whyte was due in court as part of Ticketus' damages case against the former Rangers owner . ‘Ticketus confirms that the court today issued a warrant for Craig Whyte’s arrest, having previously issued a suspended committal order on 29 September returnable today after finding Craig Whyte to be guilty of contempt of court.’ The warrant is separate to that issued last week in relation to Whyte’s takeover of Rangers. Four other men – three of whom worked for the club’s administrators Duff and Phelps - appeared in court this week over the allegedly fraudulent takeover. All four were granted bail ahead of a future hearing. Meanwhile, the war of words between Rangers Football Board chairman Sandy Easdale and former director Dave King continued on Thursday. King claims Easdale sought assurances he wouldn’t be forced out of Ibrox if the South African-based businessman’s consortium gained power last month. ‘The truth is, when I spoke to Sandy on my recent trip to Scotland his main concern was whether, after investment by our consortium, he would still be able to stay involved with the club,’ claimed King. Controversial billionaire Mike Ashley has shown a strong interest in taking over the Ibrox club . ‘He indicated that Mike Ashley would look after him if he assisted Ashley in protecting his commercial rights. ‘The new investment proposed by Paul (Murray), George (Letham) and I was seen as a threat to Sports Direct’s desire to extend its influence over the Rangers brand in all its forms. ‘After discussions with Paul and George I confirmed by email to Sandy that we had no immediate intention to remove him or his brother from board involvement at Rangers. ‘This concession was clearly not enough to gain his support and the board approved the inferior offer presented by Ashley. ‘Furthermore, in my meeting with the Rangers board, I confirmed that I could give proof of funds within 24 hours of the board accepting our proposal in principle. I was never asked to do this.’ Whyte has said that he will return to Britain in early December and hand himself over to the authorities . Easdale, who claimed on Wednesday he was ‘tired of Mr King’s antics’, refuted that claim through a statement from spokesman Jack Irvine which read: ‘There has been no discussion between Mr Easdale with Mr King on the matters mentioned in his latest statement. ‘If Mr King has any proof of such a conversation and when and where they took place he should produce it. ‘If he is suggesting any improper conduct or motive he should make his position clear. ‘Anybody who knows Mr Easdale would find it risible that he would have adopted such a subservient tone with Mr King.’ Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Craig Whyte was due to appear in Royal Courts of Justice in London .

"George Groves is determined to keep himself on course to become the 'complete fighter' with a demolition of Denis Douglin in Liverpool on Saturday. The 26-year-old super-middleweight - who holds the WBC mandatory challenger position with Anthony Dirrell before the end of March 2015 - has elected to take on the southpaw American, who was trained by his mother Saphya, as part of the undercard to the Tony Bellew and Nathan Cleverly rematch at the Echo Arena, which also includes Anthony Joshua and rival James DeGale. European champion Groves intends to consign disappointment of defeat against Carl Froch in their own multi-million re-match showdown at a packed Wembley Stadium earlier this year firmly to the history books as the Londoner aims to write a new chapter in his career.

George Groves (R) is putting his WBC mandatory challenger position on the line against Denis Doughlin (L) The 26-year-old insists he is taking a risk against the American boxer, who is trained by his mother . 'It is obviously a risky fight, because if I lose, I lose my mandatory position, but at the same time, it is the right decision,' said Groves, who hopes to one day get a third crack at WBA and IBF champion Froch, as well as a showdown with DeGale. 'I want to keep busy, I had a big fight against Carl Froch, it did not go my way, and with all of the build up and effort which went into that fight, I did not get enough out of it to justify the prep. 'I then had 12 hard rounds against (Christopher) Rebrasse and wanted to be out again before Christmas, so this is the perfect time.' Groves believes he has not stood still since his Wembley disappointment in May, when he was knocked out in the eighth round, and holds big ambitions on both sides of the Atlantic.

"Nathan Cleverly pauses, stutters and makes several false starts before deciding he can’t bring himself to do it. ‘I’m not going to give him the satisfaction of paying him a compliment,’ he says. ‘I could easily give him one but I don’t want to.

Twenty four hours later, on the undercard of Joe Calzaghe’s career-defining unification victory over Mikkel Kessler, they each continued their ring education with routine wins. They did not meet again until May 2011 when tempers flared at a press conference to promote their first fight. Bellew, who had accepted the challenge at 48 hours’ notice, failed to make the weight and had to stew for another five months before he could attempt to wrest Cleverly’s light-heavyweight world title. He lost by majority decision in front of his home crowd in Liverpool but the itch remained unscratched and the bitterness allowed to fester. Until now. A devastating knockout defeat to Sergey Kovalev last year saw Cleverly move up to cruiserweight where he was soon joined by Bellew, ensuring a rematch was inevitable. Each has had two warm-up bouts to prepare for their return to a sold-out Echo Arena on Saturday.

Bellew (right)  in action as he puts the finishing touches to his preparations ahead of the fight with Cleverly . Cleverly is looking to repeat his victory over Bellew back in 2011 . ‘There’s a lot of hate involved,’ admits Cleverly. ‘We can market the fight as good v bad because I’m going about it the right way and he’s shouting his mouth off. ‘But for boxing as a whole, and for sportsmanship, it’s bad. There’s no place for it in the game. It doesn’t need that level of hostility. He goes past the point of professionalism and takes it one step too far. ‘He wants to hurt me and he wants to end my boxing career. He wants me gone from the sport because I’m in his way and stopping him moving ahead. He wants to inflict as much damage as he possibly can, there’s no doubt about it. But I’m going to deny him that because I’m a better fighter.’ Cleverly, 27, might be more subtle about his dislike for his opponent but is equally determined to settle the matter. ‘I need to silence this guy once and for all,’ he says. ‘He’s just there in the background, annoying me. He keeps opening his mouth, whinging and moaning and being disrespectful. He’s a nuisance. ‘It’s like being back at school. I used to like challenging myself and I got into a lot of fights and I would always aim for the guy who was bigger; the bully boy. Frank Warren (centre) splits up Cleverly (left) and Bellew (right) before their previous fight in 2011 . Cleverly (left) emerged victorious on that occasion and is confident of winning again . ‘I’d set myself a challenge to take down the one who was loud, who was aggressive; the one who had that boldness. Tony is the same, he’s a bully boy. He’s a big guy, he’s got a big mouth and he tries to bully people. ‘But I’ve always said that in any walk of life, the way you beat a bully is to stand up to him and I stood up to Tony. I’ve taken him down once and I’ll take him down again. He’ll be silenced. ‘He doesn’t like me because I’m his big rival and I’m in his way. I’m the reflection of what he wants. ‘I was British, European, Commonwealth and world champion and he wanted those belts. We were both promoted by Frank Warren, we were both at light heavyweight and he wanted my position and he couldn’t have it. He hates me for that because I was denying him his opportunity. ‘I’ve already beaten him once and he’s still bitter.’ On the top floor of a quiet commercial gym in the Welsh valleys, Cleverly has just finished his day’s training. Later he will pound the pitch-black streets, alone and in his element. Even the sound of a solitary gym goer’s skipping rope brushing the floor is beginning to irk. ‘I do enjoy my own company; in the gym and in life in general,’ he reveals. ‘It’s important to do that, it’s where I get most of my constructive work done. It’s where I learn the most. Cleverly does pad work as he prepares for Saturday's grudge match with Bellew . Cleverly is confident of beating Bellew (above) and described him as 'bitter' after his last defeat . ‘I have a lot of thoughts going through my head, I evaluate life and I evaluate my fights. I picture my next fight, what shots I’m going to throw and how I’m going to win. ‘I was brought up with one of my brothers but generally I liked my own company. That’s why I entered a solitude sport like boxing.’ After his crushing defeat to Kovalev, Cleverly split with his dad Vince who had trained him since 2008 when his son left Enzo Calzaghe’s gym. After a brief spell with David Haye’s former coach Adam Booth in London, Cleverly returned to Wales and is now trained by his former strength and conditioning coach Darren Wilson who operates as a one-man band. Cleverly says he likes his own company which is one of the reasons he got into boxing . Cleverly broke away from being trained by his dad following his defeat by Sergey Kovalev . Cleverly is now trained by Darren Wilson at his gym in Bargoed in South Wales . ‘It’s difficult changing trainer in any circumstance, father or no father,’ reasons Cleverly. ‘You build up a great bond with a trainer and there’s a lot of trust involved but eventually good things have to come to an end. It was just time; it’s not the first case and it won’t be the last case of trainers and boxers going their separate ways. ‘I needed a fresh start and a fresh voice and deep down my dad understood that. We achieved an awful lot together and I’ve got to pinch myself sometimes. We went on an amazing unbeaten run with a lot of knockouts. ‘I was living the dream but things change and we move on. We still talk; we obviously don’t see each other as much now but we still talk. ‘He hasn’t been to my last couple of fights and we’re going to stick to that for this one. He was involved in a training capacity before and obviously not being involved now, it’s been difficult for him so I think it’s best we keep the boxing separate. Cleverly poses as he is weighed at St George's Hall before taking on Bellew on Saturday . Cleverly is hoping to silence Bellew 'once and for all' when they step into the ring on Saturday night . ‘It’s hard being selfish but trying to please everyone gets you stuck sometimes. As I’ve matured, I’ve had to do what’s best for me. ‘I learned a lot from Adam but I was away from home and away from my comfort zone. The training was excellent but it was the location which didn’t work for me. ‘As a fighter I’ve got to be true to myself and if something is not working, I’ve got to change it. ‘I trust myself to do what’s best for me. ‘Darren has been part of the team for a long time. He’s honest, and I trust him. There are no frills. ‘He has a good work ethic and he’s in the sport because he enjoys it, not because he has to be. He wants success; the trust issue is a big factor. He’s a good friend as well.’ Bellew holds up some inflatable sheep thrown by the crowd at the weigh-in on Friday . Cleverly is hoping to silence Bellew 'once and for all' when they step into the ring on Saturday night . Cleverly, too, remains in the sport by choice. Given the nature of his first career defeat in which he was knocked down twice before the referee spared him any further punishment in the fourth round, and his degree in maths, he could be forgiven for choosing a different path. ‘I’ve got such a good academic brain and I could have a comfortable life outside boxing,’ he says. ‘I could turn my hand to many other things but it’s boxing I’ve decided to do and to stick to because I’ve worked too hard to just throw in the towel; I’ve come too far. ‘I’m on the verge of big things again so to throw it away at this stage would be a real shame and something I could never forgive so for me it’s about giving it another crack and going to get another world title. That’s my goal and that’s what I’ve set out to do.’ These days, when Cleverly bumps into those playground bullies, there is a knowing smile and a shake of hands. Will he afford the same respect to Bellew? ‘No, I don’t think so. I think too much has been said now.’","Nathan Cleverly will take on Tony Bellew in Liverpool on Saturday .

"Hull manager Steve Bruce has defended under-fire Wigan chairman Dave Whelan, insisting he is not a racist. Whelan has been accused of making anti-Semitic comments as well as claiming there was 'nothing bad' in calling a Chinese person a 'chink' during an interview with the Guardian. That comes on the back of his controversial appointment of Malky Mackay as Latics manager at a time when the former Cardiff boss is under investigation by the Football Association for allegedly exchanging discriminatory texts with then colleague Iain Moody. Malky Mackay was appointed Wigan boss this week, despite the text and email scandal . Whelan has come under fire and has faced accusations of being racist in some quarters . Whelan, 77, has since apologised for causing offence and Bruce, who managed Wigan on two occasions under Whelan's watch, is willing to stand as a character witness. 'Maybe sitting on the fence might be the easiest thing to do but I've worked under Dave Whelan twice - I know him very, very well,' said Bruce. 'There's no racism in him at all. Sometimes words can be said which can be misplaced, they can be out there in the public domain, but certainly when I've worked with him there's been no sign of racism. But Hull boss Steve Bruce has defended Whelan and insisted that he is not a racist . 'He is without question one of the best chairmen I've worked for. What you see is what you get.' Bruce also described appointing Mackay as Uwe Rosler's replacement prior to the FA verdict as a 'brave' call. 'It's a big brave decision by him,' added Bruce. 'But he thinks that's the best thing for his football club. Being Dave he'll be single-minded enough to see that through.'","Steve Bruce defends under-fire Wigan chairman Dave Whelan .

"Arsenal’s chances of landing Sami Khedira have all but disappeared with the player now needed to replace the injured Luka Modric until the end of the season, when he will leave Real Madrid on a free transfer. The Gunners failed to bring the World Cup winner to the Emirates in the summer but looked like getting a second opportunity in the summer with Real still willing to let Khedira leave for around £5million in January rather than lose him for free in the summer. But Modric is out for three months having torn a tendon in his thigh and Carlo Ancelotti said on Wednesday: 'We will solve the problem because we have Kroos and Khedira as a World Cup-winning pairing and Isco can also play there.' Sami Khedira should be available on a free transfer in the summer, with Bayern and Chelsea leading the way . Khedira (right) could still sign a new contract, but it is likely he will depart when his contract runs out at Real . Khedira’s form between now and the end of January in Modric’s place could yet force Madrid to improve the rejected offer they made the player last season. But it seems more likely the player will sign a pre-contract agreement in January with Bayern Munich favourites over Chelsea for his signature. Jose Mourinho is a massive fan and has already signed Khedira once when he was at Madrid.  Bayern are slight favourites because they favour players returning to Germany. Khedira is now needed by Real Madrid because of the injury to midfielder Luka Modric . If the Bundesliga champions do capture the 27-year-old, who captained Germany in their 1-0 win over Spain in Vigo on Tuesday, it will be a victory for chairman Karl-Heinze Rummenigge over coach Pep Guardiola. The former Barcelona manager is not Khedira’s biggest fan and is still unhappy that the club allowed Toni Kroos to leave for Real at the start of the season. Rummenigge, however, sees signing Khedira on a free having sold Kroos to Madrid for £30m after the World Cup as good business. Manager Pep Guardiola is not Khedira’s biggest fan, but Karl-Heinze Rummenigge wants the German .

"The World Cup last summer should have been a period of down time for the Premier League boss, and in some ways it was — but it was also an opportunity for reflection. Richard Scudamore had been in charge of the top flight for 15 years as English football’s most enduring senior administrator. But now there was a possibility his time was up. First, there was the sexist emails affair, in which he forwarded messages he acknowledges were inappropriate, containing jokes derogatory to women. He apologised at the time for the nature of those emails and will not discuss the issue in depth now. England's defeat by Croatia at Wembley in 2007 prompted the Elite Player Performance Plan . The scandal prompted his first period of reflection and he was able to carry on in his job because there was never any desire among his paymasters, the Premier League clubs, for his removal. ‘Of course I was extremely encouraged by the support I received through what was a challenging summer,’ said Scudamore. ‘That was from, firstly, colleagues and clubs. Ultimately there was a wider group of interested people. ‘What matters is the 20 clubs and the 100 people who work at the Premier League.’ But, as he indicates, there was another reason to question his future. Shortly after the email furore sprung up, he was at the Royal Brompton Hospital for heart surgery. This was routine and planned but still carried significant risks. Richard Scudamore and Patrick Mayes of Leicester U12s at the Tyne Cot War Memorial in Ypres, Belgium . ‘I wasn’t scared because the Royal Brompton has fantastic people,’ said Scudamore. ‘But does it give you time to reflect? Yeah. You don’t know whether you are going to come out of it and you don’t know whether you’ll have that energy you had before. I took stock. ‘In fairness to the clubs, I said, “I’ll go away, I’ll take stock and let’s see how I feel when I get back”. I was back doing bits within a couple of weeks. ‘Probably after two months, by the time I did the season launch, I pretty much knew I was going to be OK.’ Manchester United have stuttered in the Premier League under Louis van Gaal . Scudamore shows no sign of slowing down. The day we meet, he is on his way to Ypres in Belgium, where the Premier League Under 12 teams are on an extended weekend, which includes an inter-club qualifying tournament as well as an educational trip to the First World War battlefields and memorials. The Premier League’s Christmas Truce tournament has become so established that the league has funded an artificial pitch in nearby Poperinge, where the games are played. The facility was opened by Scudamore last week. Problems keep arising, too. Last year he appeared to be at loggerheads with FA chairman Greg Dyke, declining to serve on his FA Commission to improve the England team. Now the mood seems more conciliatory. Rangers and Celtic joining the Premier League 'is definitely not on the agenda', says Scudamore . ‘When you step back, what does Greg want to achieve?’ said Scudamore. ‘He wants to achieve more and better homegrown players. Well, the reality is, if you look at the Elite Player Performance Plan (EPPP, the Premier League youth strategy established in 2011), that’s the opening line, the opening objective: more and better homegrown players, who are able to hold their own in Premier League first teams and qualify to play for England. ‘The only thing that really got tetchy was the tactics . . . of a big, grand opening statement. Our view was that he (Dyke) hadn’t gone and looked under the lid to see what was there already. ‘You can’t argue with what he’s trying to achieve and that’s why it feels different a year on.’ However, the Premier League is still seen by many as the principal stumbling block for the England team. The accusation is that while Scudamore is busy banking ever more extraordinary TV deals, England can rot. Scudamore takes on the point with passion. ‘You can plot the traces of the EPPP. I can date it: November 21, 2007, England v Croatia, 2-3, in the rain. I was there with a number of people. We went ballistic. That’s when we went away and recruited Ged Roddy (who oversees the EPPP and youth academies) and said, “We’ve got to do something to get the thing back up”. Scudamore defends foreign owners like Roman Abramovich at Chelsea . ‘We care as passionately as anybody about England winning. You sit and watch these tournaments and wish we could do better but there is a limit to what we can realistically do. ‘Players have to be developed at clubs — they are the hub of development. In the early days it’s schools, which is why we’re heavily investing in school sport. We want to build that because we do want a better England team.’ Scudamore is English and knows how to tiptoe through the topic. What do owners such as Roman Abramovich, John W Henry, Stan Kroenke, Bryan Glazer and Sheik Mansour think about the issue? Liverpool fans protest with banners about the rising cost of tickets for Premier League matches . ‘You said “foreign owners” but it’s nothing to do with foreign owners this issue. It’s irrelevant. Clubs’ owners first and foremost want their clubs to win. But there are an awful lot of owners who understand that a successful England team would make the glow in which the Premier League is seen a more positive one.’ Ticket prices is the issue almost every English football fan would want to raise with Scudamore. He expresses his frustration that most surveys quote top-end prices when the League deliberately encourages clubs to charge expensive executive prices so they can make more, cheaper tickets available. ‘It’s like going on to the British Airways website and just asking for the first-class single airfare,’ he said. The rise of West Ham and Southampton this season helps sell the Premier League around the world . ‘It is undoubtedly true and I cannot deny that since the Premier League was formed, the overall dynamic for the attending fan has altered. What is absolutely true is that season on season we have lost what some might describe as some of our core, traditional fans. ‘But what is also undeniably true is that we’ve picked up far more. Is it a real topic? Yes, it is. Are the clubs listening? Yes, they are. Are they doing everything that the fans would want them to do? Of course, they’re not.’ Celtic and Rangers joining the Premier League is definitely not on the agenda — ‘I can see what’s in it for them; I can’t see what’s in it for us’ — and nor, he says, is the 39th Game or an international round of Premier League games. ‘There’s no economic imperative to play games abroad but there is a marketing (argument),’ he said. ‘I’m not here saying the person who’s had a season ticket for the last 30 years isn’t more important than our fan base in Asia or America. But you can’t ignore them.’ Intriguingly, Scudamore bangs the drum for globalisation by invoking Communism. He links the rise of Southampton, Swansea and West Ham this season to growing international revenues, which are distributed equally, as opposed to the domestic TV deal, which is weighted towards the big clubs. Southampton qualfying for the Champions League would help boost the Premier League . Though he remains doggedly impartial, he gives the impression he would view as it as a success for the Premier League model should Southampton qualify for the Champions League. ‘When the season ends, whoever has won it, and people say what do you want to happen next year, I just say, “I want somebody else to win it”. And that goes for Champions League places as well. I’d like to see a different four teams in the Champions League. ‘You have to be a little bit careful as you also want your best teams, your strongest teams, in the Champions League, because you want us to do well. ‘But generally we want to change it up. We don’t care who wins as long as it isn’t the same clubs every time. ‘I’ve sat here for 10 years saying the more we develop internationally, the more revenues are distributed evenly. It is a far more communist/taxed system, where the big clubs are being taxed internationally to pay for the smaller clubs. The advantage is the gap narrows. Therefore, you do get more chance for a small club, a middle club, to beat the top clubs.’ Scudamore appears to be ready for a new phase. In time, the ‘challenging summer’ may prove a footnote .

"Marco Reus' future at Borussia Dortmund is becoming increasingly unclear but Franz Beckenbauer believes the German club would be able to survive without the 'extraordinary' forward. Chelsea, Real Madrid and Manchester City are just some of the clubs touted as possible destinations for Reus, who has scored 47 goals in 99 games for Dortmund. But Beckenbauer, a legend of Dortmund's great rivals Bayern Munich, is adamant the club would be able to cope without Reus - although he does believe the forward makes them stronger.

'They still have plenty of other great players, although Reus is obviously an important player for Dortmund. 'When there's so much talk about a player, it means that he is an extraordinary player and that's most certainly the case with Reus.' Reus has been courted by a number of Premier League sides and looks certain to leave Dortmund next summer. The 25-year-old has been capped 23 times by Germany, scoring on seven occasions.

"The Professional Footballers' Association is still hopeful that convicted rapist Ched Evans will be given an opportunity to return to the game after Sheffield United withdrew their offer to let him use their training facilities. The League One club announced on Thursday night that they had severed their ties with Evans after the decision to allow him to train with the club was met with widespread opposition and led to the resignation of four club patrons. Olympic heptathlon gold medal winner Jessica Ennis-Hill also asked that the club remove her name from one of the stands at Bramall Lane if  Evans re-signed. Ched Evans playing for Sheffield United in 2012 before his conviction and imprisonment . Ched Evans, pictured in Wilmslow, Cheshire on Wednesday, will not be allowed to train at his old club . Evans, pictured at his home on Monday, was originally given the opportunity to train at Sheffield United . The PFA had initially asked the Blades to allow Evans to train with them, and said in a statement on Friday: 'We note Sheffield United's decision to retract the offer they made to Ched Evans for him to return to training with the club. 'It is not surprising given the subsequent delay in his return as the matter was debated and understandably strong opinions were aired. 'We fully understand and respect the opposing views to Ched's return to Sheffield United and clearly part of the issue related to him returning to the club he was previously with at the time of his imprisonment. 'With that in mind, it may ultimately be of benefit to both parties to move on and for Ched to look for a fresh start at a different club. 'We maintain our general position that the courts determine punishments and a return to society and a contribution to the community through employment is a key element of rehabilitation. 'We do not agree that society should impose different rules for footballers which go beyond the position of the law. In that regard, it is hoped that Ched will be given an opportunity at another club to return to the job he is trained to do.' Sheffield United admitted they had underestimated the criticism they would receive for letting Evans train with the club. The decision provoked considerable public outcry, with television presenter Charlie Webster, sixties pop star Dave Berry, musician Paul Heaton and Sheffield businesswoman Lindsay Graham all quitting their roles as club patrons. A petition against Evans rejoining attracted over 165,000 signatures. Charlie Webster, left , and Jessica Ennis-Hill both voiced opposition to Evans returning to the club . Ennis-Hill said she wanted her name removed from the stand at Bramall Lane if Evans was re-signed . VIDEO Sheffield United make u-turn on Evans training decision . The Blades statement issued on Thursday read: 'The club initially accepted a request from the PFA for Ched Evans to be able to train. The reaction to this has been at an intensity that could not have been anticipated when first announced. 'Members of the board have consulted dispassionately with the club's supporters, vice presidents, community foundation members, executives, staff, sponsors and other relevant stakeholders in order to help it reach this decision."" Webster welcomed the decision, writing on Twitter: 'Sheffield United have done the right thing by not letting Ched Evans train with them. It's the right thing for the club, its fans, its community and the victim. @SUFC-tweets is a great club with a fantastic history and now its future can be fantastic too.' Evans served half of a five-year prison sentence having been found guilty of rape in April 2012. Evans has always denied raping the woman, saying the sex was consensual, but he was found guilty by a jury at Caernarfon Crown Court. An appeal against his conviction was rejected by three judges at the Court of Appeal in 2012, while following his release from prison, he uploaded a video on his website protesting his innocence and vowed to clear his name.

"Steve Harmison knew who to call when he first clapped eyes on a young, raw but gifted Ben Stokes at Durham eight years ago. ‘I’d never compare him to people who have gone before, including someone I was close to, but I remember speaking to that certain all-rounder when Ben was about 15 and the cheeky little sod had come into our dressing room,’ said one of England’s best modern fast bowlers. ‘I rang him and said, “I’ve just seen you”.’ The call was made, of course, to Andrew Flintoff, inseparable from Harmison during their England days, and the comparison has proved to be a valid one, with Stokes conjuring up echoes of the Lancastrian both on and off the pitch. Steve Harmison believes that Ben Stokes (pictured) can be as good as Freddie Flintoff for England . Stokes possesses a rare ability with bat and ball, but also a propensity to self-destruct - much like Flintoff . ‘Fred asked me what I meant,’ said Harmison, ‘and I said, “Well, he goes out to bowl with no socks on and just picks up a bat and goes out to bat”. Everything is an event with Ben and he has gone on to be a phenomenal cricketer.’ Of all the promising young players who have emerged for England in the past year, none has the potential to excite — and perhaps frustrate — as much as Stokes, who joined the team in leaving for their one-day series in Sri Lanka on Sunday. He has already shown, at 23, that he possesses rare ability with both bat and ball but also the propensity to flirt with the self-destruct button a la Flintoff, as most spectacularly shown when he thumped a locker in frustration in Barbados in March and badly broke his right wrist. Harmison (left) and Flintoff were inseparable at times during their England careers . Stokes kicks the ground in frustration during a test match against India in July . ‘Ben can be as good as he wants to be,’ said Harmison, speaking to promote Royal London’s sponsorship of the Professional Cricketers’ Association Benevolent Fund. ‘But he needs to be used in the right manner and England mustn’t stop him being the explosive, charismatic character he wants to be. Personally, I would take a bit of pressure off his bowling and put more onus on his batting. ‘I think the frustrations of playing on a big stage and then going to a smaller one can get to him. He went last winter from Australia, with everything going well for him on fast wickets, to the Caribbean on slow ones being watched by one man and his dog. That’s when frustrations come out. He’s had to learn. Because of his own doing in punching that locker he’s let in two players in Chris Jordan and Chris Woakes who are now competition for places. But Ben is one of the best young players I’ve ever seen. It’s hard to put that on one man’s shoulders but if he is batting at six and bowling well, England have a very good team.’ Stokes can be 'as good as he wants to be,' according to former England fast bowler Harmison . Stokes has also impressed for his county side Durham, pictured celebrating in September at Lord's . Harmison believes England are approaching the most intensive 18 months of cricket in their history with a bowling attack that stands comparison with the fabled quintet of Harmison, Matthew Hoggard, Simon Jones, Flintoff and Ashley Giles from the 2005 Ashes. ‘Steven Finn is the key to how England do in Sri Lanka and the World Cup,’ added Harmison. ‘I believe that, if they are all fit and firing, (Jimmy) Anderson, (Stuart) Broad, Finn, Stokes and (Moeen) Ali is as good a line-up as we had in 2005, I really do. And Finn is the key to that. ‘If he can get back to his best it makes life easier for others. And they could be better than we were because, other than Jimmy, they have youth on their side too.’","Ben Stokes possesses a rare ability with both bat and ball .

"Richie McCaw has squeezed in a lot between his two trips to Caerphilly Castle, which stands seven miles north of Cardiff. His first visit was in 1999, while he was on tour with New Zealand Under 19s, and his second was earlier this week when he took time out ahead of his 100th Test as captain of the All Blacks. One World Cup, three International Player of the Year awards and a legacy as one of the greatest rugby players of all time sit at the top of his CV. Yet the iconic No 7 still strives to better himself, pointing out on Friday that there is room for improvement in the game against Wales on Saturday. VIDEO Scroll down to see Wales' forwards coach Robin McBryde talk about the NZ clash . New Zealand's Richie McCaw will play his 100th Test as All Blacks captain against Wales on Saturday .

McCaw makes a pass in training in Cardiff before Saturday's tie at the Millennium Stadium . New Zealand have won three from three so far on their northern tour but that is not enough for McCaw, who wants to finish on a high in front of his parents after they made the 23-hour trip to witness his milestone at the Millennium Stadium. The 32-year-old has spent more than two years of his life on tour with the All Blacks, but 1999 still holds vivid memories. ‘It was my first real trip outside New Zealand,’ he said. ‘To go on tour with a New Zealand team was something I never dreamed of and to get the chance straight out of school was pretty cool. Tony Woodcock was in that team; it makes you feel a bit old! ‘A few of us had a look around Caerphilly Castle the other day, which we did back in ’99. That brought back a few memories of walking around with wide eyes. I never thought I’d be coming back 15 years later with all the things that happened in between.’ Wales was where McCaw first captained the All Blacks in 2004, but also the scene of his worst defeat, a controversial 20-18 loss to France in the 2007 World Cup quarter-final. The ghosts of that upset, which sparked national uproar back home, were laid to rest in 2011, when New Zealand were crowned world champions in their own back yard, and head coach Steve Hansen puts that down to a change in mindset under their skipper. ‘In 2007 we had a team which should have won the World Cup but we stuffed it up because we expected to win it,’ said Hansen. ‘We had the players to do that but we didn’t have the mindset. You have got to go and earn the right to win it. I don’t think we were hungry enough. ‘When you expect something to happen you sit back and wait for it to happen, but when you are really hungry for something you go and take it. Mentally we have got stronger.’ They have created an unbreakable aura and that is what Wales must overcome on Saturday. Warren Gatland’s side have not beaten any of the Southern Hemisphere powerhouses since 2008 and their record against the Kiwis stands at 25 consecutive defeats — by an average margin of 24 points — since their last victory in 1953, more than 25 years before any of the current team were even born. McCaw and his team-mates have won three from three on their northern tour in the Autumn internationals . New Zealand perform their famous Haka in 2011 with McCaw at the centre after winning the World Cup . All Blacks coach Steve Hansen (left) claims McCaw is New Zealand's 'greatest ever rugby player' McCaw made his first performance as captain for his country against Wales in November 2004 . So when asked if a shock result on Saturday would top winning the Six Nations, it is little surprise that Dan Biggar’s answer was ‘absolutely’. ‘For us to win would be the best days in our rugby careers,’ said the Wales No 10. ‘It’s been a long time since we beat the All Blacks and we have it in us to do it. Hopefully we can create something special. ‘They may be the best rugby side ever. We will all have to come up with nine-out-of-10 or 10-out-of-10 performances to get a result. Anything below that from each of us is probably not going to be good enough. We have to turn up and push ourselves to demand excellence.’ That level of excellence is what McCaw demands in training every day. If Wales are going to deny the Kiwi a happy 100th, then they will have to defend the Millennium Stadium like Caerphilly Castle.","Richie McCaw will make his 100th Test for New Zealand on Saturday .

"Sheffield United have bowed to the wishes of their fans and severed their relationship with convicted rapist Ched Evans. Club officials sparked a public outcry when they accepted a request from the Professional Footballers' Association to let their former striker train with the club following his release after serving half of a five-year prison sentence. Evans maintains he is innocent of raping a woman in a hotel room in April 2012 and has made an application to the criminal cases review commission for an appeal. Ched Evans, pictured in Wilmslow, Cheshire on Wednesday, will not be allowed to train at his old club . Evans, pictured at his home on Monday, was originally given the opportunity to train at Sheffield United . But the announcement last week to let Evans train with the club led to several high profile supporters standing down as patrons of the club, while Olympic champions Jessica Ennis-Hill said she would want the stand named after her at Bramall Lane to be renamed if Evans was re-signed. Television presenter Charlie Webster, musicians Paul Heaton and Dave Berry and Sheffield businesswoman Lindsay Graham have all resigned from their roles with the club, while a petition against Evans rejoining the club attracted more than 150,000 signatures. The club board came under further pressure when Ennis-Hill's statement led to her being subjected to sickening abuse on Twitter. Evans was released from prison in October after serving two-and-a-half years of a five-year rape sentence . Charlie Webster, left , and Jessica Ennis-Hill both voiced opposition to Evans returning to the club . In a statement, Sheffield United said: 'Following the statement dated 11th November and after ongoing and extensive deliberation, Sheffield United Football Club has decided to retract the opportunity for its former player, Ched Evans, to use the club's facilities for training purposes, as was previously intended. 'Members of the Board have consulted dispassionately with the club's supporters, vice presidents, Community Foundation members, executives, staff, sponsors and other relevant stakeholders in order to help it reach this decision. 'Also, the club has been diligent in communicating with The Football Association, The Football League, The Professional Footballers' Association (The PFA), The Football Association of Wales and The National Probation Service to take further soundings. Ennis-Hill said she wanted her name removed from the stand at Bramall Lane if Evans was re-signed . Paul Heaton (left), pictured with Norman Cook, also resigned as patron for the Blade's Community Foundation . 'We recognise that a number of our supporters will be disappointed with this decision, but would ask that they remember the responsibilities we have not only to a fine and proud club, whose history stretches back over 125 years, but also to the communities in which Sheffield United is active and to the city we represent. 'The club initially accepted a request from The PFA for Ched Evans to be able to train. The reaction to this has been at an intensity that could not have been anticipated when first announced. 'As noted in previous statements from the club, the legal system of this country provides for both the punishment and the rehabilitation of every person who has been found guilty of a crime. 'Sheffield United will not be used to promote the view that professional footballers should be treated differently, as has been the want of certain sections of the media and various commentators. In addition, we remain disappointed at some of the inaccurate reporting, misinformed views and commentary, as well as the actions of a minority of individuals on social media. Professional footballers must be treated as equals before the law. A small section of Welsh fans held a banner in Evans' favour at a recent international match . VIDEO Ched Evans training with Sheffield United . 'The club condemns rape and violence of any kind against women in the strongest possible terms. The club is aware that Ched Evans is pursuing legal recourse via the Criminal Cases Review Commission in the determination he has to clear his name. We trust that he will be afforded a fair hearing. 'During this whole period, we have been served a timely reminder of what we have been throughout our history: Sheffield United is a family and community club that, even in times of adversity, will remain strong and grow from its experiences. 'The club will not be making any further comment on this issue.' 2011 - May 30: Ched Evans arrested on suspicion of sexual assault at a Premier Inn near Rhyl, North Wales. July 26: Evans and fellow footballer Clayton McDonald are charged with rape. 2012 - April 20: Evans is jailed for five years for rape and McDonald is acquitted. Evans maintains his innocence with his lawyer saying: 'Mr Evans firmly maintains his innocence in this matter and is being advised regarding an appeal of the decision.' April 23: The Professional Footballers Association is forced to defend itself after Evans is named in the League One team of the year with chief executive Gordon Taylor stating: 'That was a football judgement by his fellow professionals, it was not a moral judgement and in no way does the PFA condone the offence for which he was convicted.' Evans is released by Sheffield United at the end of the season. April 24: Evans' lawyers announce he is to appeal against his conviction.

November 6: Evans loses his appeal after his case is rejected by three judges at the Court of Appeal in London. 2014 - April 18: An online petition is launched urging United not to re-sign Evans and gains over 165,000 signatures.

November 11: Sheffield United confirm Evans will return to train with the club with immediate effect following a request from the Professional Footballers' Association but state they are 'not prepared at this time' to make a decision on whether to re-sign the striker.

"Misfiring Liverpool striker Mario Balotelli insists criticism of his performances this season does not affect him and he is putting in more effort than ever before. The Italy international has yet to score in the Premier League since his £16million summer move from AC Milan with his two goals coming against Bulgarian minnows Ludogorets and Swansea in the Capital One Cup. There is added pressure on the 24-year-old in the continued absence of Daniel Sturridge, who has not played for his club since August 31 because of injury and was this week ruled out until 2015 by a new thigh problem. Mario Balotelli has insisted that critics do not concern him despite yet scoring in Premier League for Liverpool . Balotelli greets a group of young Reds fans with a smile at Liverpool Academy Day on Thursday . But Balotelli stressed his approval rating outside his inner circle is not something which concerns him. 'I don't need people to believe in me so long as I believe in myself,' he told Fox Sports Australia. 'The important people for me are my family and my few close friends.' Criticism of Balotelli has centred not only around his lack of goals but the apparent unwillingness to put in the effort on the pitch. However, the striker insists he is working harder than ever before and rated his overall performance as 7/10 - a half-point increase on the assessment of himself two years ago. 'I run more than before,' he added. 'I've never run like this...so I give a half point more. 'Goals, they will come. It is something that's just not coming at the moment.' The Italian forward has struggled since his switch back to the Premier League from AC Milan . Balotelli shown tussling with Hull City defender James Chester (right) during the 0-0 draw at Anfield last month . Sturridge's latest injury, which has prompted a full-scale medical investigation into his recurring problems given he has missed 30 of 82 matches since arriving from Chelsea in January 2013, has dealt a significant setback to Liverpool as they look to get their season back on track after slipping to 11th in the table. He was expected to return this weekend at Crystal Palace but manager Brendan Rodgers must now find a way of getting goals out of Balotelli, fellow summer signing Rickie Lambert and Fabio Borini - who between them have failed to score in 998 minutes in the Premier League this season. Vice-captain Jordan Henderson admits the players have to help maintain Sturridge's spirits during his lengthy spell out. Daniel Sturridge has suffered yet another injury setback and is set for another spell on the sidelines . Liverpool vice-captain Jordan Henderson has admitted that the absence of Sturridge is a major blow . 'It is a big blow, not only for the team but for him as well,' he told ESPN. 'He is devastated, at a really low point really because he was looking forward to getting back playing. 'He felt good so it is disappointing for us as a team and him personally. 'We have to make sure as team-mates we are strong for him because he is doing everything he can in the gym and on the training field to get back as quick as he can. 'Hopefully he has a quick recovery, a speedy recovery and he comes back firing on all cylinders.'","Mario Balotelli insists criticism of his performs don't affect him at all .

"Lucas Leiva has admitted he is open to a move away from Liverpool and could join Napoli in search of regular football. The Brazil international has only featured seven times for Brendan Rodgers' side this season with his current deal at the Merseyside club ending in 2017. The 27-year-old nearly joined Napoli in the summer, a move which would reunite him with former Liverpool boss Rafael Benitez in Serie A. Lucas Leiva (left), who has fallen down the pecking order at Liverpool, could join Napoli in Serie A . 'Is it possible that Lucas could leave Liverpool in January? Yes, naturally. Lucas likes Rafael Benitez a lot. After all, the two know each other well from when the Spaniard was coaching Liverpool,' Lucas' agent Henrique Coelho told Calciomercato.com. Having only made two Premier League starts this campaign Lucas has revealed he is open to a move away with limited playing time under Rodgers. 'I must think about leaving as there is no room for me at Liverpool,' Lucas told Radio Marca. 'I'm not speaking to anyone at the moment because I'm under contract, but I am looking around, given I am not playing. Lucas, being replaced by Steven Gerrard, is open to a move away from Anfield to gain regular football . 'There was contact with Napoli last summer, but the parties didn't reach a satisfactory agreement. The situation at Napoli was not advantageous for everyone but despite that, I know Rafa Benítez has always had a lot of faith in me. 'I want to play but at the same time, I need to be patient. I need to find a solution, be it at Liverpool or some other club. In the past there were rumours linking me to Atlético Madrid, but there was nothing concrete,' Lucas added. Lucas has fallen down the pecking order behind captain Steven Gerrard, Jordan Henderson and Joe Allen in the Liverpool midfield this season, despite their slow start.

"The last time somebody mistook Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain for another player, it saved him from being sent off, but against Scotland it robbed him of a goal.

"Rangers chairman David Somers was accused  of being 'disingenuous' after claiming Dave King's failure to provide proof of funds and identify members of his consortium made it impossible to accept the South African-based businessman's offer of investment in the troubled Ibrox club. A proposal from King's group was considered last month along with another from Sale Sharks owner Brian Kennedy before the Ibrox board finally accepted a £2million interest-free bailout from existing shareholder Mike Ashley. The Newcastle United owner subsequently increased that amount by a further £1m, with the total loan amount secured against the Glasgow club's Edmiston House and Albion car park properties. David Somers has been accused of being 'disingenuous' after saying he couldn't accept Dave King's money . Rangers in action against Alloa at Ibrox on Saturday - a match they drew 1-1 . In a rare interview on Tuesday, Somers spoke publicly for the first time on why the club had turned down former Ibrox director King, who was also looking for 51 per cent of Rangers shares in return for his consortium's £16m investment. But the Ibrox chairman – who claimed that he could not tell shareholders 'hand on heart that these guys have got the money' - provoked a furious response from King's consortium. They claimed proof of funds was available 'immediately' but that Sandy Easdale, chairman of the Rangers football board, had agreed that the information could be provided once the backing of shareholders was confirmed. 'We had three people offering us funds,' said Somers. 'And I felt it was very important we do proper due diligence on all three. Rangers midfielder David Templeton (centre) takes a shot on goal from long range . Dave King's (left) money was not accepted by Rangers' chairman David Somers, but Mike Ashley's (right) was . 'In the past, Rangers has perhaps done deals it wouldn't have if it had done proper due diligence. 'Where (the King offer) fell down was really at stage one. When I said to all three of these people: ""Would you show me proof of funds?"", two showed me proof of funds. The consortium did not. 'The second question for the consortium was: 'I know there are eight of you, I only know three of you. Can I please have the other five names?' And the message I was getting all the time was: 'If you agree to do deal, if you persuade 75 per cent of shareholders, then we'll show you funds and you can have the other names'. 'It wasn't meeting the due diligence requirements. The simple questions were: 'Show me the money' and 'Give me the names'. 'I cannot go to the shareholders with a deal where I don't know all of the names and I can't check (those) names out. I can't go to the shareholders and say with my hand on my heart that these guys have got the money. 'With the other two people I could. We went round the houses and in the end we moved on to stage two with two providers (Ashley and Kennedy).' David Somers pictured arriving at Ibrox for a Rangers match earlier this year . Sports Direct billionaire Ashley, who controls just under nine per cent of Rangers, also runs the club's retail arm. But when he gave the club a further £1m earlier this month he relinquished the rights to rename Ibrox Stadium that he had purchased for just £1 from former Rangers chief executive Charles Green. Somers insisted Ashley's security demands on the car park and Edmiston House were less onerous than what was on the table from Kennedy. He added that Ashley's loans being interest-free, coupled with the Newcastle United owner's commercial interest in seeing Rangers thrive, represented the best deal for the club. 'It was a simple question of which provider was offering the lowest interest rate and Mike Ashley was offering zero interest rate, which was difficult to beat,' said Somers. 'And (it was about) which provider wanted the least security. Again, Mike Ashley wanted Edmiston House and the car park, but it was a small amount of security relative to the other deal. Once we got to that stage, it was a no-brainer which one we were going with. 'Also I think Mike Ashley had the advantage because we have an important joint-venture with him, with the merchandising agreement, which is important to us. We make quite a lot of money from it. He and we are both keen that Rangers has financial stability because we will both benefit.' While Tuesday was the first time Somers had gone public to explain in detail why the King and Kennedy deals were turned down, his comments echoed an earlier statement Rangers issued to the stock exchange on November 12. On Tuesday night, however, King said Somers was 'being disingenuous with his comments'. In a statement, the businessman added: 'We had private discussions with both (former chief executive) Graham Wallace and Sandy Easdale in which we told them that we would immediately provide proof of funding and details of the full make-up of the consortium following confirmation from Sandy Easdale that the shareholders whom he represents were prepared to support the terms of our investment proposal in principle. 'Sandy Easdale agreed to proceed on this basis. Unfortunately, he was not then able to provide the confirmation we asked for. There was no possibility of proceeding any further without the support of Sandy Easdale's group who had the power to block our proposed investment.' Brian Kennedy was not available for comment on Tuesday night.","Dave King offered investment to Rangers when they were in dire need of it .

"Bayern Munich proved they can be as impressive off the field as they are on it by paying off their stadium debt 16 years ahead of schedule. Chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge revealed the Bundesliga champions have 'completely paid off' the money borrowed to build the Allianz Arena. Speaking to the club's magazine, Rummenigge said: 'In 2005 we borrowed exactly 346 million euros (£275m) in a 25-year plan, which was meant to last until 2030.

Arsenal borrowed a similar amount of money to build the Emirates Stadium, which opened in 2006. The Gunners' latest financial results indicated that, while they have cash reserves of £207m, they still have a significant debt to pay on their stadium, which they spend almost £35m servicing every year. Should Arsenal wish, they could use their cash reserves to pay off the majority of the money they owe for the Emirates, but the north Londoners prefer instead to save that money for player transfers and other costs . Bayern share their 71,137-seat stadium, which opened in 2005, with second-division 1860 Munich. 1860 sold their 50 percent stake to its larger city rival in 2006, while maintaining the right to play games there. The stadium, which is sponsored by a financial services company, is illuminated in red when Bayern plays, and blue when 1860 does.

"England's handling of Kyle Eastmond and Semesa Rokoduguni was under scrutiny yesterday as the backs were picked to start for Bath on Saturday, despite being deemed unavailable for Test selection. Rokoduguni played against New Zealand earlier this month, but the wing has been ruled out by the national coaches since, apparently due to a thigh injury. Centre Eastmond was again in the starting XV against South Africa last weekend, but was released to his club after suffering concussion. However, Bath have recalled both men to face London Irish at the Madejski Stadium. Head coach Mike Ford said: ‘Roko came back to us on Monday and he was good to train.

Nico Rosberg believes he can force Lewis Hamilton into making a crucial mistake in their Formula One title showdown on Sunday.

Rosberg claims that his Mercedes team-mate has been 'making some mistakes' recently . 1. Lewis Hamilton - 334 points . 2. Nico Rosberg - 317 points . Lewis Hamilton will be crowned world champion if he finishes second in the season-ending Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, even if Nico Rosberg wins the race. If the final race was a ‘normal’ race with 25 points for the winner, rather than the double points on offer, Hamilton would be able to claim his second drivers’ title with a sixth-place finish. The Brit must finish first or second at Yas Marina, where the final grand prix carries double points, to be certain of taking the title. Hamilton, who was slow to shake Rosberg’s hand at their press conference, insisted he would not use dirty games to win. He said: ‘We’re not children. We should know what is wrong and right.’ 'This is an extremely exciting moment for my career.

"The investigation into World Cup bidding has seen a number of individuals having ethics cases opened against them, it has been announced. The action has been taken by FIFA ethics investigator Michael Garcia, and was announced in a joint statement with ethics judge Hans-Joachim Eckert following a meeting of the pair at FIFA headquarters in Zurich. A FIFA executive committee member has been reported as asking for 'hard cash' for World Cup votes . Les Murray (right) reported the demand of the FIFA executive committee member to his superiors . It is not known how many people have had cases opened against them, or for what specific reasons. FIFA has also lodged a separate criminal complaint with the Swiss attorney general. The statement also said Garcia's full report into his investigation into bidding for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups would be passed to Domenico Scala, the chairman of FIFA's audit and compliance committee, who determine how much of the information should be made available to FIFA's executive committee. The statement read: 'The investigatory chamber has already opened a number of formal cases against individuals as a result of that inquiry. Investigator Michael Garcia is unhappy with FIFA after publication of his report into corruption . 'Neither the recent referral of the reports to the Swiss Federal Public Prosecutor's Office nor the request to the chairman of the FIFA Audit and Compliance Committee will interfere with those ongoing proceedings.' The statement was released a few hours after it was claimed a FIFA executive committee member had been reported to the ethics committee after asking for 'hard cash' in return for votes during bidding for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups - but no action was ever taken. Les Murray, an Australian who was on the FIFA ethics committee at the time, reported the demand after being informed of it by people working for the Australia 2022 bid. Sources with knowledge of the cash-for-votes demand said the FIFA Ex Co member asked for $5million (£3.19m) to build a sports centre. Former FA chairman David Bernstein has called on England  to boycott the 2018 World Cup in Russia . Murray has now questioned why his report of the incident was not mentioned in ethics judge Eckert's findings. Murray wrote on his blog on the website of Australia broadcaster SBS: 'Three years ago, when I was still on the FIFA ethics committee, I was informed by sources inside the Australian bid team that a member of the FIFA executive committee was asking the Australians for hard cash in return for votes. 'I reported this information up the chain of the ethics committee at the time, as was my duty, but I see no mention of it in Eckert's report.' Eckert last week cleared Russia and Qatar to host the 2018 and 2022 World Cups saying rule breaches by the bidding countries were 'of very limited scope' Garcia responded by notifying FIFA that he intends to lodge an appeal against the decision due to 'numerous materially incomplete and erroneous representations of the facts'. FIFA acknowledged the joint statement from the ethics committee chairmen. A FIFA statement said: 'We understand that the chairman of the Audit and Compliance Committee, who is also independent, will evaluate the matter and decide on any next steps.' Whistleblower Phaedra Almajid claimed she received threats against her and her children . Another whistleblower, Phaedra Almajid, who worked for the Qatar 2022 bid team before losing her job in 2010, claims she will live the rest of her life in fear after receiving threats against her and her children. She provided evidence of wrongdoing to Garcia's independent inquiry into the 2018 and 2022 World Cup bids. Her evidence was given on condition of anonymity - a condition she believes was deliberately breached in a summary of Garcia's report published by FIFA ethics committee judge  Eckert last week. 'Do I regret being the Qatar whistleblower? It has cost me personally, it has cost me emotionally - I know for a fact I will be looking over my shoulder for the rest of my life,' Almajid told Sky Sports News. 'It has cost me my credibility and most importantly it has cost me the security of both me and my children.

"Xabi Alonso has disrespected his former Real Madrid team-mates Cristiano Ronaldo and Iker Casillas after backing Manuel Neuer to win the Ballon d'Or, according to reports in Spain. That's the view of newspaper Marca, who claim that Alonso has shown bitterness after leaving the La Liga side for Bundesliga giants Bayern Munich last summer.

"A late Stevan Jovetic penalty gave Montenegro a 1-1 draw against Sweden in a lively Euro 2016 Group G qualifier after Zlatan Ibrahimovic fired the visitors ahead with an opportunist first-half strike on Saturday. The result left Sweden second on six points from four games, one ahead of Montenegro and Russia and four behind leaders Austria who beat the Russians 1-0 earlier on Saturday to stay firmly in the driving seat. The Swedes will feel hard done by after Scottish referee William Collum disallowed an added time goal by midfielder Albin Ekdal and awarded Montenegro a contentious free-kick for what looked like off-the-ball tugging between two players. VIDEO Scroll down to see trailer for upcoming Zlatan Ibrahimovic documentary . Zlatan Ibrahimovic is congratulated by his Sweden team-mates after scoring in the ninth minute . The Paris Saint-Germain ace was unable to help his side claim all three points against Montenegro . Manchester City striker Stevan Jovetic cancelled out Ibrahimovic's early goal from the penalty spot . Ibrahimovic, having recovered from a niggling heel injury which kept him out of Sweden's last two qualifiers silenced a raucous home crowd with a fortuitous ninth-minute effort. He headed a long ball towards the penalty box and, when a clearance by Zarko Tomasevic rebounded off Sweden midfielder Erkan Zengin back to him, Ibrahimovic side-footed a first-time shot past keeper Mladen Bozovic. It was his 51st goal in 101 internationals and the towering striker missed several chances to add to his tally, hitting the post with a ferocious free kick in the second half after blasting high an easy chance midway through the first. Manchester City striker Jovetic had a powerful header saved by Andreas Isaksson shortly after the Montenegrins fell behind but despatched the spot kick after Vladimir Jovovic was fouled by two defenders as he burst into the area from the right flank. Montenegro centre back Marko Basa skied a shot over a gaping net from two metres in a frantic finish before the home fans twice let out a huge sigh of relief when Ekdal first returned the favour and then saw his rasping volley ruled out by Collum.

Wenger will be able to call on the services of Welbeck and Giroud for the first time against Manchester United this weekend as the Frenchman has returned from a foot injury.

VIDEO Welbeck will always score goals - Dublin . Ahead of Arsenal's showdown with Manchester United, Wenger said on the duo: 'There’s always a fight because we have a lot of offensive options. 'Welbeck can play in different positions up front and there is room for both of them to start in some games. Of course it is a fight.' Wenger also revealed he has always respected Welbeck as a footballer and has responded to Louis van Gaal's claims that he was never going to be an Old Trafford regular. 'I always respected Danny and I always felt that he had a great future. 'What he has achieved in the last few months has certainly allowed him to gain more respect, especially for the English national team as well - he’s now one of the main players in the national team and he showed that again in Scotland. 'I believe that you have to understand Louis van Gaal had not had Welbeck under his command for a long time and it’s always very difficult to know the players well when you see them for three or four weeks.

"Tony Bellew and Nathan Cleverly exchanged final petty insults and jibes but stopped short of turning their weigh-in violent. Both men had been warned about their conduct as fears grew that a fight would breakout prematurely. But they kept their cool to ensure their bitter rematch goes ahead on Saturday night. VIDEO Scroll down to see footage of Bellew and Cleverly's heated weigh-in . Nathan Cleverly and Tony Bellew continued their hostilities at the weigh-in on Friday afternoon before their fight on Saturday evening . The pair managed to keep the weigh-in civil without any violence but made sure they got in their last psychological digs at one another . Both weighed in under the cruiserweight limit in front of a capacity crowd in the resplendent St George's Hall. Unsurprisingly, their cheers were reserved entirely for Bellew with Cleverly on the end of a rather more hostile reception. Perhaps mercifully, three long years of talking is now at an end as Bellew bids to avenge his defeat to then world champion Cleverly. The Liverpool crowd was orchestrated by Bellew who clearly relished the limelight in his hometown for the weigh-in . Bellew soaked up the atmosphere before he hit the scales with the local Liverpool crowd showing their support for their man . The resplendent St George's Hall was packed with boxing fans to witness the weigh-in between local favourite Bellew and Cleverly . Cleverly received a hostile reception in Liverpool but remained focused at the weigh-in on Friday, weighing in just below the limit . Bellew weighed-in a fraction under the 200lb limit for the cruiserweight division ahead of facing Cleverly . They will next set eyes on each other ahead of the first bell at a sold-out Liverpool Echo Arena. 'It’s been a long time coming but tomorrow the talking stops. It’s real now and I’m excited,' Bellew told Sky Sports News HQ. ‘I talk a great fight because that’s what I feel. I’m the cruiserweight here, a manufactured cruiserweight against a fat cruiserweight.’ Bellew added: ‘I’ve waited long and hard in a 12 week training camp away from family and loved ones whereas he stayed in a dingy house in Wales. He (Cleverly) should have stayed and trained in London with Adam Booth. ‘You need more vision and desire than that. I have more desire than anyone in this division. This could be the fight of the year if he can absorb what I’ve got for him. Both fighters insist the talking stops now but they had plenty to say to each other during the weigh-in and had to be separated . ‘I’ve prepared to go to the trenches, I’m prepared to go to war. If not then it’s going to be a very short, sharp fight for him. ‘This is the defining fight in both of our careers. We will be remembered for Saturday night, simple as that. It will be a painful, brutal fight for him. It will be the end of his career Saturday night.’ Meanwhile, Cleverly had his say at the weigh-in: 'I’m very happy, it’s a good weight for me. Making the weight isn’t a problem and I feel good. 'I’m ready, I’ve had a great training camp, mentally I feel sharp and I should perform well. It’s the biggest fight of my life. It’s such a grudge match, a massive rivalry and it’s got personal. When I win it will mean the world to me and then I can move on to bigger and better challenges. 'It’s going to be a tremendous atmosphere. I really hope and I really think it’s going to be a great fight. Cruiserweight is chapter two for me and this is the acid test.'

"Olivier Giroud is set to make his long-awaited come back from injury in the crunch clash against Manchester United. And manager Arsene Wenger has designs on pairing the Frenchman with £15million striker Danny Welbeck to form a potentially prolific strikeforce in the not too distant future. Giroud has missed three month after sustaining a freak ankle injury in the 2-2 draw against Everton at the end of September. Arsenal striker Olivier Giroud has regained fitness and is in contention to face Manchester United on Saturday . That 2-2 draw with Everton back in August was the last time the France striker appeared in an Arsenal shirt . But, as Sportsmail revealed last week, the striker is set to be named in Arsenal's squad to face Louis van Gaal's men at the Emirates Stadium. 'He (Giroud) is three or four weeks ahead of schedule. Originally we planned to have him back for competition at the beginning of next year, so he is one month ahead. 'We relied on Welbeck, and on Alexis Sanchez as well, but we have Giroud back, we have Theo Walcott back. 'Slowly they will integrate into the team again and give us different options.' Giroud's return poses a selection dilemma for Wenger given he plays with a lone striker, theoretically meaning he could be forced to choose between Welbeck and Giroud on match days. The pair have trained with each other just twice due to Giroud's long-term injury. And Wenger is keen to analyse how the pair gel as a conventional strike pairing in training, feeling it is a tactic that could be benefit his side this season. Giroud returned to training ahead of schedule having suffered a serious leg fracture back in August . However, Welbeck is expected to start as the lone striker against the club he left on transfer deadline day, with Giroud on the bench. Wenger has also revealed Mathieu Debuchy (ankle) and Laurent Koscielny (achilles) will make their returns next month. 'Koscielny and Debuchy are doing well, they are out on the field [working] again. We have to see now,' said the Arsenal boss. 'Usually field work is three weeks away from full group training, then there is fitness. It looks straightforward for Debuchy. It's not inflammation, it's just repairing surgery. Mathieu Debuchy and Gunners team-mate Giroud watched the ATP World Tour Finals in London last week . Alexis Sanchez has been a shining light for the Gunners but Arsenal are only sixth in the Premier League .

"Tony Bellew risked being hauled before the boxing authorities after alleging Nathan Cleverly has a problem with alcohol ahead of their highly-charged rematch. As the pair squared up during a heated head-to-head on Thursday, Bellew asked: ‘Been to any AA meetings lately?’ The jibe was taken to refer to Alcoholics Anonymous but Cleverly dismissed the accusation and predicated Bellew will have to answer to the British Boxing Board of Control (BBBC). Tony Bellew (right) asked Nathan Cleverly if he had been to any Alcoholics Anonymous meetings recently . ‘I honestly don’t know what he’s referring to,’ he said. ‘He tried personal insults before the first fight and this AA one is a new one. He’s desperate to rattle me but I’m too strong. He’s making these things up and waffling on. He needs a good slap and he’s going to get one. ‘There should be a line but that just sums him up as a person. There’s no boundary with him, he’s horrible. ‘Who doesn’t enjoy life around work? I do but to make an accusation like that is insulting to me. ‘It’s no major issue to me but on a wider horizon, in terms of the Boxing Board, they’ll probably do something about it. ‘You can’t have idiots like him making accusations.’ The BBBC’s General Secretary Robert Smith told Sportsmail: ‘Mr Cleverly has no history of alcohol abuse. He has passed every medical and blood test and has never caused us concern. The two fighters will meet on Saturday night in their second clash, but their first as cruiserweights . ‘We will look at the whole interview but I cannot comment until I’ve seen it.’ Bellew later played dumb when asked to explain the retort. He said: ‘What does AA mean? What’s that? I’m just saying what does AA stand for?’ When it was explained, he added mockingly: ‘Is it? Is that what he’s been up to? For an athlete like that to attend those classes, a strong-minded athlete! We’ve opened a can of worms haven’t we? I can’t believe it! ‘He said he hasn’t been for 18 months. I seem to know an awful lot more about him than he knows about me. ‘I’m just letting people know he is not this clean-cut guy that he likes to pretend he is, going on as if I’m some street thug. ‘This guy can’t even stay on the straight and narrow for himself. The 31-year-old Liverpool-born boxer trains ahead of his clash at the Liverpool Echo Arena . ‘I’ve had this guy call me everything under the sun for the last three years. I’ve had this guy try and pick apart my career for the last three years. I’ve had this guy make snipes at me for the last three years. I gave this guy all the respect when we fought but what does he do? ‘He basically p***** on my chips and tries to make a fool of me. Does that sound to you like a respectful kind of reply? So I’m just repaying back what’s been given to me.’ The rivalry that has bubbled under the surface since the pair’s first fight in 2011 will reach boiling point at this afternoon’s weigh-in, the final time the fighters will meet before the first bell at Liverpool’s Echo Arena on Saturday night. Bellew claims his hatred of Cleverly stems from comments he made in the aftermath of their world title fight when he said he had been in ‘second gear’. Cleverly believes Bellew is jealous of his three-year reign as champion. The two boxers are held apart during their head-to-head on Thursday ahead of their weekend fight . Both men suffered defeats last year in what proved to be their final outing at light heavyweight. Cleverly was beaten up and stopped over four torrid rounds by Sergey Kovalev while Bellew was knocked out by another world champion in Adonis Stevenson three months later. Having both moved up to cruiserweight, two routine victories apiece have set them up for this long-awaited rematch. ‘I took time out, freshened up, found my new weight and I feel great,’ Cleverly added. ‘This is the acid test. ‘If he lands and I see the red mist I might go after this guy — the last man standing will prevail and I think that’s me.’ Cleverly considered retiring after his devastating defeat to Kovalev, a sign, says Bellew, of weakness. ‘We’ll find out who is mentally strong,’ he said. ‘When he gets hit clean, lets see if he wants to come back and trade. ‘It’s getting real now and it’s getting close. I’m relaxed, I’m calm, I’m not an angry man.

"Luke Shaw has called on Manchester United’s fringe players to step forward and help Louis van Gaal find a way out of an injury crisis which has deepened during the international break. Daley Blind, David de Gea and Michael Carrick have all been injured since leaving for international duty two weeks ago. Blind has damaged knee ligaments, De Gea dislocated a finger and Carrick hurt his groin. Angel di Maria has had scans on his foot after clashing with United winger Nani - who is at Sporting Lisbon on loan for the season - during Argentina’s game against Portugal at Old Trafford. Luke Shaw says Manchester United's fringe players will have to lift the club from its injury crisis . Shaw had an injury scare of his own while impressing at left back for England in the win over Scotland . United boss Louis van Gaal in a buoyant mood as Argentina took on Portugal at Old Trafford on Tuesday . The Argentinian playmaker hopes to be fit to face Arsenal on Saturday, as does Shaw, who came off 66 minutes into England’s win in Scotland as a precaution after feeling the muscle tighten in his left hamstring. ‘We know we’ve picked up a lot of injuries, especially in defence, where it’s always changing each time,’ said Shaw. ‘We’ve obviously picked up another injury with Daley Blind but we’ve got to deal with that and try to get around this week and go firing into the game on Saturday. ‘I think it’s time for people to step up, those who are not getting game time and who are frustrated on the bench can come in for a massive game like Arsenal that everyone will want to play in. Everyone will be working hard and focusing on this weekend and come the game, we’ll be ready to go.’ Daley Blind suffered a knee injury as Holland took on Latvia in their Euro 2016 Group A qualifier . David de Gea hurt a finger during training with the Spain national team during the international break . Shaw impressed at left back, winning his fourth cap in the 3-1 win against the Scots before he was replaced by Kieran Gibbs. ‘I picked up a few knocks during the game and my left hamstring, which I hurt at the start of the season, I could feel a little bit,’ said Shaw. ‘We had a discussion at half time over whether to bring me off then but it was a game I didn’t want to come off in, so I played on and then Roy decided to sub me. We’ll have to see. I’m hoping to be fit.’ The 19-year-old defender will be anxious to play against Arsenal at the Emirates Stadium, and further cement his place in the United side, after his £31million summer transfer from Southampton. The hamstring problem disrupted his start to the campaign, but he has since forced his way into the team after responding well to Van Gaal’s fitness demands. Michael Carrick (right) is another United casualty of the past fortnight after picking up a groin complaint . Argentina's United winger Angel di Maria had scans on his foot after a clash with on-loan Portuguese Nani . ‘The fitness side was something me and him talked about,’ said Shaw. ‘But I feel really good at the moment, really fit. It was all about getting a run of games and that’s something I’ve had.

Now I’ve had a run of games and I’m feeling really good. Hopefully I can show people why United have bought me.’ United defenders Phil Jones, Marcos Rojo, Rafael and Jonny Evans have all been out but Chris Smalling will return to boost Van Gaal’s options after serving his suspension for the red card at Manchester City.

Hopefully, we’ll have a strong team for Saturday.’ It doesn’t help their defensive headaches, but Nani, who has more than four years left on his Old Trafford contract, claims his United career may not be over despite his loan move. ‘It’s a possibility that I might come back to Manchester United,’ said the Portuguese winger after completing 90 minutes in his country’s 1-0 win at Old Trafford. ‘Why not?

"Louis van Gaal hasn't had the ideal start to life as Manchester United manager, having watched his new side pick up just 16 points from 11 games while racking up a disastrous number of injuries. The Dutchman is now sweating on the fitness of a whopping 12 players ahead of Saturday's Premier League clash against Arsenal. Daley Blind is definitely out along with fellow summer signings Marcos Rojo (shoulder), while Radamel Falcao (calf) is struggling. Manchester United midfielder Daley Blind sustained a knee injury during Holland's win against Latvia . Blind goes down in agony after a collision with Eduards Visnakovs during the first half . United could be handed a boost with the news David de Gea might play against Arsenal . Daley Blind: Suspected knee injury . David de Gea: Finger injury . Michael Carrick: Groin/Pelvis injury . Angel di Maria: Ankle injury . Luke Shaw: Hamstring injury . Marcos Rojo: Dislocated shoulder . Rafael: Muscular injury . Ashley Young: Groin/Pelvis injury . Phil Jones: Calf/Shin injury . Radamel Falcao: Calf/Shin injury . Jonny Evans: Ankle/Foot injury . Jesse Lingard: Knee injury . Goalkeeper David de Gea, who dislocated a finger while on international duty with Spain, is a doubt but there is hope he could be fit. Van Gaal must have also feared his injury curse had struck again at Old Trafford after record signing Angel di Maria was asked to play on having been stamped on by Nani during a friendly between Argentina and Portugal. With the United manager watching anxiously from the stands, Argentina surprisingly asked Di Maria to continue after he had finally got to his feet after being stricken for a couple of minutes. Unbelievably, United have now had 39 injuries since Van Gaal took over the reins at the Premier League outfit in the summer. He has been particularly hard hit at the back. Costly injuries to centre halves Phil Jones and Jonny Evans, plus the recent suspension of Chris Smalling and the shoulder problem for stand-in Rojo have hampered United's hopes of challenging in the Premier League. Angel di Maria looked to be in pain following a Nani tackle during Portugal's 1-0 win against Argentina . Marcos Rojo, who joined  United in the summer, was carried off on a stretcher against Manchester City . The good news for United fans is that as many as four first team members are expected to return to action this weekend. Defensive duo Jones (shin splints) and Evans (ankle) could be in contention for a squad place while Falcao may also return after a two-week break during the international fortnight. Meanwhile,sources close to the Spain team toldSportsmail on Tuesday evening that De Gea has ‘an 80 per cent’ chance of making the starting line-up when his club return to Barclays Premier League action this weekend. Van Gaal will certainly be hoping he can patch his side together in time for Arsenal on Saturday. Louis van Gaal has several injuries worry ahead of the weekend's match against Arsenal .

"Multiple Olympic champion Michael Phelps finished seventh in a loaded 100 metres final at the United States National Championships in Irvine, California on Wednesday ending his hopes of swimming four individual events at this month's Pan Pacific championships. Phelps was last at the turn and could make up little ground in the final 50 in the glamour event on the first day of the championships. London Olympic champion Nathan Adrian dominated a race featuring seven Olympians to win in 48.31 seconds, while Ryan Lochte, swimming in lane eight, finished second as Phelps touched in 49.17. Back: Michael Phelps has continued his return to swimming at the U.S. nationals . Glum: But he was disappointed with a seventh placed finish during the 100m freestyle final . Cohorts: But he still found the time to congratulate fellow Olympic champion Nathan Adrian who won . It was the most significant race for Phelps since he came out of retirement in May, nearly two years after winning his record 18th Olympic gold medal. His seventh-placed finish ensured he did not qualify for the event at the Pan Pacific Championships to be held on the Gold Coast in Australia later this month, though he still has the 100 butterfly, 100 backstroke and 200 individual medley to swim in order to qualify for the U.S. team. Adrian described his swim as 'not great' but was nonetheless pleased to win. 'The third 25 I took off a little bit and then held on at the end,' he told USA Swimming's website 'It's an extraordinary field and it's an honour to be part of it.' Lochte, swimming in lane eight, was satisfied with the runner-up spot as he works his way back from a serious knee injury he suffered in November. Satisfied: Ryan Lochte was happy with second place as he continues his return from a knee injury . Winner: Another Olympic champion Missy Franklin won the 100m freestyle on the women's side . 'This year has been the biggest rollercoaster of my life,' the 30-year-old said. 'I couldn't see the rest of the field. I just had to put my head down and hope for the best.' In the women's 100 freestyle, 19-year-old Missy Franklin mowed down fellow teenager Simone Manuel with almost the final stroke to claim a narrow victory in 53.43, matching her own championships record. 'I knew I was going to have to come home so fast,' Franklin said. In the men's 200 butterfly, Californian Tom Shields swam a personal best as he built a big lead after 100 metres and held on for an emphatic victory by nearly a second in 1:55.09, the third fastest in the world this year.","Phelps comes in seventh during 100m freestyle final at U.S nationals .

"Brazil chalked up their sixth straight win, all in friendlies, since the World Cup when they beat Austria 2-1 on Tuesday in a joyless performance marred by tactical fouls and a negative approach. A stunning late strike by Roberto Firmino, his first for his country, won the match for Brazil, although Austria were the more enterprising team and could easily have gone in with a halftime lead. Austria, previously unbeaten this year, at least had the consolation of being the first team to score against Brazil since Dunga replaced Luiz Felipe Scolari as coach following their woeful World Cup performance in July. Brazil substitute Firmino celebrates after scoring the winner for his country late on in the game . Earlier in the match, PSG defender David Luiz had opened the scoring for the Selecao with a header . Luiz wheels away in celebration after opening the scoring for his country against Austria in Vienna .

Goals: Luiz 64, Firmino 83 . Referee: W Collum . Attendance: 48,500 . Aleksandar Dragovic converted a penalty in the 75th minute, ending Brazil's run of five successive clean sheets, to cancel out David Luiz's header just after the hour. Brazil were low on creativity, often struggling to play the ball out of their own half in the face of the home team's aggressive pressing, and repeatedly interrupted Austrian moves with rough and cynical fouls in midfield. Fernandinho escaped a booking when he left Veli Kavlak with blood streaming from a cut near his eye when he went in for one challenge with his elbows flying. ""I ask the referee if he left his yellow cards at home,"" Austria coach Marcel Koller told reporters. ""I was surprised that he allowed them to commit so many fouls without booking them."" Brazil had a lucky escape when Marko Arnautovic's low ball across the penalty area bounced off Filipe Luis's knee to safety, followed by another when Florian Klein's shot deflected off a defender's knee and flew over. Diego Alves also had to parry a corner out from under his crossbar as Austria pushed forward. Oscar fouled Andreas Weimann in the box to give Austria a penalty, and in turn a route back into the match . Aleksander Dragovic duly obliged and slotted home the penalty to level the scores . Dragovic (centre) sends Brazil goalkeeper Diego Alves the wrong way to make it 1-1 in Vienna . Dragovic (second left) celebrates with his team-mates after scoring a penalty for Austria against Brazil . Brazil had to wait for over half an hour for their first real shot when Oscar tested Robert Almer with a low effort from 25 metres and a David Luiz free kick flew over the crossbar shortly afterwards. Brazil broke through in the 64th minute when David Luiz headed in from a corner although he seemed to tug his marker's shirt as he got to the ball. Austria did not give up and Arnautovic had a shot deflected over the crossbar before Oscar tripped Andreas Weimann and Dragovic sent Diego Alves the wrong way.

"Raphael Varane fired France to a 1-0 win over Sweden in a friendly at Stade Velodrome on Tuesday. The France captain headed home a corner from Antoine Griezmann in the 83rd minute. His Real Madrid teammate Karim Benzema had an opportunity to double the lead from the spot three minutes later but fired his penalty over the bar. France coach Didier Deschamps made eight changes to the side that drew 1-1 with Albania last week, while an uninspired Sweden side played without striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic, who was rested.

Booked: Wendt 85 . France left-back Layvin Kurzawa was replaced in the 78th after pulling his left hamstring. France dominated possession from the outset to put pressure on Sweden, which almost turned the ball into his own net in the 33rd and the 38th. The hosts' most spectacular play came just after the half an hour mark when midfielder Mathieu Valbuena chested a cross from Dimitri Payet to hit a bicycle kick that sailed wide. France striker Andre-Pierre Gignac then split the Sweden defense with a through ball for Griezmann in the 36th but a heavy touch from the Atletico Madrid forward allowed goalkeeper Andreas Isaksson to collect the ball. Sweden, who beat France 2-0 in their previous meeting at Euro 2012, nearly scored against the run of play four minutes before half-time with a spinning shot from Isaac Kiese Thelin but he was denied by goalkeeper Steve Mandanda, who made a diving save.

Gignac and Griezmann were again France's most threatening players after the break. Gignac controlled a cut back from Payet in the 49th minute but had his close-range attempt saved by Isaksson with his right leg. Then, Griezmann pounced on a header across goal from Gignac in the 58th for an overhead kick that went wide. Two minutes later, Varane redirected a corner toward Griezmann, whose powerful strike was parried by Isaksson. The Sweden goalkeeper also stopped an angled shot from substitute Moussa Sissoko in the 79th but was helpless when Varane planted his header into the bottom corner.

"Daniel Sturridge has been ruled out of playing for Liverpool until 2015 after sustaining a thigh strain in training. It continues a nightmare season for the 25-year-old who was finally fulfilling his potential on the pitch, only for two serious injuries to intervene. In Liverpool and Brendan Rodgers, he seems to have found a club and manager best suited to nurturing his undoubted talent. Here, Sportsmail looks back at the striker’s career so far, a tale of promise and woe, which has seen him have spells at four different Premier League clubs. Daniel Sturridge scores for Liverpool during their 2-1 victory over Southampton on the first day of the season . But Sturridge has not played for Liverpool since and now could be out until next year . Manchester City . Sturridge joined the Manchester City Academy aged 13, having earlier played at youth level for Aston Villa and Coventry City. He made his debut at 17, becoming the first player to score in an FA Youth Cup, FA Cup and Premier League in the same season, but his progress was soon curtailed by a hip injury. The club’s transfer budget was dramatically increased first by the takeover by former Thailand Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra and later Sheikh Mansour. Jo, Robinho, Shaun Wright-Phillips and Craig Bellamy were all brought in and Sturridge was by then resolved to leaving. After he left, he was criticised by one club source as being ‘too interested in fame and money’ but Jim Cassell, City’s former Academy Director, recalled in the Daily Telegraph a player with a ferocious drive to be the best he could be, at odds with his growing reputation as being a footballing mercenary. Sturridge joined the City academy at 13, having earlier played at youth level for Aston Villa and Coventry City . Sturridge's progress with Manchester City was soon curtailed by a hip injury . Chelsea . Sturridge joined Chelsea in 2009 for an undisclosed fee and around £60,000 a week salary. He was characterised as a ‘nightmare behind the scenes,’ by one club insider and gained a reputation for being selfish on the pitch, although Sturridge has countered that this was never the case. His potential was never properly realised at Stamford Bridge. A succession of managers favoured established strikers, such as Didier Drogba, Nicolas Anelka, and later the eye-wateringly expensive Fernando Torres. A six-month loan spell at Bolton in 2011, where he scored eight in 11 games, suggested he was stifled at Chelsea. Sturridge was even tried out as a winger by Andre Villas-Boas. He watched from the bench as Chelsea beat Bayern Munich to win the Champions League in 2012. Sturridge was characterised as a ‘nightmare behind the scenes,’ by one club insider at Chelsea . A six-month loan spell at Bolton in 2011 saw him score eight in 11 games . Liverpool . Sturridge has flourished on Merseyside, scoring, 32 goals in 46 appearances since joining the club in 2013. His partnership with Luis Suarez saw the club almost clinch the Premier League title last season. But when he signed, many – notably including Sir Alex Ferguson – thought he was too big a risk. Even Brendan Rodgers admitted that ‘If he wants to stay at this level, this is probably his last chance,’ when he was introducing him to the press. After finally finding a club where he is both praised and constructively criticized, he has shaken off the label of being selfish and hungry for fame and money. Sturridge is as important to Liverpool as they are to him and both will want him fit and scoring again.

"Chelsea fans are finally getting to know a little bit about summer signing Filipe Luis after the Brazilian took part in a Q&A session at Stamford Bridge on Wednesday night. The Brazil international was joined on stage by club legend Didier Drogba and veteran goalkeeper Mark Schwarzer as fans quizzed the trio.

The left back - speaking good English - revealed his penchant for films and admitted to owning 2,000 movies at his home, even claiming watching films was how he learned to speak English. Luis also let fans in on his less than impressive culinary skills, admitting that he can't cook and then showed off his mischievous side by photobombing Didier Drogba's as the Ivorian tried to capture the Stamford Bridge pitch.

"Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink has pledged to cover hundreds of miles this winter to gen up on the opposition as he strives to deliver League Two glory to Burton Albion. The Dutchman achieved a winning start in his new job when the Brewers won 3-1 at Wycombe Wanderers in front of the Sky Sports cameras on Monday night. And Hasselbaink, who says he is influenced by compatriots Louis van Gaal and Guus Hiddink, has pledged to make his team ‘as exciting as possible.’ Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink emerges from the tunnel at Adams Park to begin his new career at Burton Albion . Phil Edwards gave Hasselbaink a great start to his tenure heading home from a corner against Wycombe . Hasselbaink applauds his new players during his first game in English management . Hasselbaink says he is influenced by compatriots Louis van Gaal (left) and Guus Hiddink . Burton’s appointment of the former Leeds United and Chelsea striker raised a few eyebrows, especially since Hasselbaink has only one season of managerial experience under his belt - at Royal Antwerp in the Belgian second division. But the 42-year-old is more than happy to work his way up from the bottom tier of the English Football League. He said: ‘For me, it’s not about starting in League Two, League One, the Championship or the Premier League. It’s about the job, it’s about the project and where the club wants to go. Former Chelsea striker Hasselbaink holds a Burton scarf aloft during his unveiling as their new manager . ‘You look at the history, the people who run the club, the potential - those were the important bits, not that Burton are in League Two. ‘This is a club going in the right direction and I want to be part of that. I feel we are a good fit.’ Hasselbaink added: ‘I’m not too proud to work at this level - it’s still the same game. OK, it might be a bit different, but we are still here to win football matches and it’s about passion. I love football because of the passion, whatever the level.’ There was plenty of excitement around the former Premier League star trying his hand in the lower leagues . The new Burton manager signs a shirt outside the ground for a fan with an old Chelsea jersey . That passion will see Hasselbaink cover the length and breadth of the country over the coming weeks and months to ensure Burton can maintain and perhaps improve on their current fourth position in the table. ‘If we are not playing and future opponents have a game, I will drive hundreds of miles to go and watch them if necessary,’ he said. ‘And I would do that if I was working in the Championship, or at the majority of Premier League clubs, as well. It’s just part of the job. Maybe the Premier League is a bit different because every game is on TV. Hasselbaink celebrates scoring a goal for Chelsea against Tottenham back in April 2004 . ‘I have been at clubs with two analysts instead of the one we have at Burton; and we have one scout for every three or four that other clubs might have. ‘It’s the detail where things are just a little different, but that doesn’t matter - it is what it is, and I’m ready for it.’ We saw a first glimpse of the type of football Hasselbaink’s Burton will be playing when they cruised to a 3-1 win over fellow promotion contenders Wycombe at Adams Park and it is clear a philosophy is taking shape. Hasselbaink (left) and assistant manager David Oldfield are all smiles at their unveiling earlier this month . Hasselbaink said: ‘Every manager you have played under or worked for, you learn from them all. There are always things you like and, sometimes, things you don’t like, but you use them to your benefit. ‘I’m very fond of Steve McClaren (they worked together at Nottingham Forest), I’m fond of Louis van Gaal, Guus Hiddink, the list goes on. I’m very fortunate, I’ve worked with some top managers. ‘We’re going to try to be as exciting as possible. I like my team to be positive, whatever that is, and there’s still a lot of work to be done. But I do have a good group to work with here, and they are willing to learn.’ Hasselbaink only had the luxury of three training sessions to prepare his team for the trip to Wycombe and the fixture list doesn’t get any easier. They welcome current league leaders Luton to the Pirelli Stadium on Saturday and then travel to second-placed Shrewsbury next weekend.","Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink won his first game in charge of Burton Albion against Wycombe Wanderers .

"Daniel Sturridge will not play for Liverpool again until 2015 following the latest setback in his nightmare season. The England striker is set for another six weeks on the sidelines after scan results confirmed he had suffered a grade two thigh strain during training at Melwood on Monday. It is the same thigh Sturridge damaged whilst on England duty in September but it is a completely different injury. The rehabilitation programme, however, is the same and that means he will miss a huge chunk of Liverpool's stuttering campaign. VIDEO Scroll down for Alan Brazil: Brendan Rodgers upset by Sturridge injury saga . Daniel Sturridge has not played for Liverpool since August and now could be out until next year . If Daniel Sturridge is out for the next twelve matches, he will miss the following fixtures for Liverpool: . Crystal Palace (A) - November 23 . Ludogorets (A) - November 26 . Stoke (H) - November 29 . Leicester (A) - December 2 . Sunderland (H) - December 6 . Basle (H) - December 9 . Manchester United (A) - December 14 . Bournemouth (A) - December 17 . Arsenal (H) - December 21 . Burnley (A) - December 26 . Swansea (H) - December 29 . Leicester (H) - January 1 . 'Sturridge has already missed Liverpool's last 14 games but he could potentially miss their next 12 fixtures, which include assignments against Ludogorets, in Sofia next Tuesday, and Basle (December 9) that will decide their fate in the Champions League. Aside from that, Sturridge will also be absent for huge clashes in the Barclays Premier League against Manchester United at Old Trafford (December 14) and Arsenal at Anfield (December 21), as well as a tricky Capital One Cup quarter-final away at Bournemouth. Liverpool said in a statement: 'LFC confirmed scans have revealed Daniel Sturridge has sustained a new thigh injury. The player will remain unavailable for selection but will be monitored and assessed during his recovery.' Given Sturridge's injury history, it is unlikely he will be back inside six weeks and he has still not kicked a ball for Liverpool since signing a new contract, which is has the potential to be worth £150,000 per week, on October 3. It is a massive blow for Brendan Rodgers, who had been hoping to relaunch Sturridge's campaign at Crystal Palace on Sunday, but his patience will now be being tested by how much the 25-year-old has been out.

Ankle ligaments - England v Republic of Ireland May 2013, returned for pre-season. Ankle ligaments - December 2013. Missed nine games. Thigh - during England training, September 2014. Missed six weeks. Calf - during Liverpool training, October 2014. Missed three weeks. Thigh - during Liverpool training, November 2014. Out for six weeks. After Liverpool drew 0-0 with Hull last month, Rodgers gave a glimpse of his feelings of being without Sturridge when he said: 'He won’t become a top European striker until he plays consistently. It doesn’t matter about potential. You have to play.' When Sturridge first damaged his thigh at St George's Park on September 5, his recovery was slower than expected and he ended up back at square one when he pulled a calf muscle in training. Sturridge resumed full training once again at Melwood last week but he now has to start the rehabilitation process all over again and, for Rodgers, it could not have come at a worse time. Fabio Borini, Rickie Lambert and Mario Balotelli have failed to score in 998 minutes of Premier League football for Liverpool and Rodgers would be entitled to feel worn out by the situation by his side's lack of goals. In an attempt to find a solution, they would be prepared to offer Lille more money to secure Divock Origi's release from a season-long in January. They signed the Belgium striker for £10million in the summer but agreed to loan him back to Lille immediately.

"Roy Hodgson has given England Under 21 chief Gareth Southgate the pick of his senior squad for next summer’s Euro 2015 tournament in the Czech Republic. Senior internationals, including Jack Wilshere, Raheem Sterling, Calum Chambers, John Stones, Phil Jones, Luke Shaw, Ross Barkley, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Saido Berahinho, are all eligible for the Under 21 tournament. England have a fixture against Republic of Ireland in Dublin on June 7 followed by a trip to Slovenia for a Euro 2016 qualifier seven days later. Jack Wilshere, was was superb in England's recent 3-1 win over Scotland, is eligible for Southgate's side . Liverpool and England star Raheem Sterling is another senior star who could play in the 2015 tournament . Manchester United centre back Phil Jones could be available for Southgate in the Czech Republic . Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, fresh from his goal scoring heroics against the Scots, could also feature . Southgate, who is torn between picking the best players from the senior squad and sticking with the players who qualified, now has the final say. Hodgson, who finished off the international year with a 3-1 victory over Scotland on Tuesday, said: ‘It is very simple. My policy is this: after Gareth Southgate has picked his squad I will pick my squad. I will take whatever is left. Can it be simpler than that? ‘I’ve just said, he can pick any Under 21s who are available and I will take the rest. ‘He will speak to me, tell me what he wants to do. I can’t be fairer then to say it is his choice. Roy Hodgson has given England Under 21 chief Gareth Southgate the pick of his senior squad . Southgate could bring a stellar cast of senior England internationals to next summer’s Euro 2015 tournament . Southgate, however, is torn between including more senior stars and staying loyal to the likes of Danny Ings . ‘Whether he will want to take all these players that is up to him, that’s another matter. You will have to speak to him.’ The Under 21 tournament begins on June 17 and is increasing in importance at the FA following the country’s disastrous showing at the 2014 World Cup in Brazil. A number of England Under 21 players have already expressed concern about the possibility of senior stars joining the squad and threatening the team spirit Southgate has engineered. Southgate could call upon a formidable central defence of John Stones (left) and Calum Chambers . Hosts Czech Republic, along with Denmark, Germany, Italy, Portugal, Serbia and Sweden have also qualified for the two-week tournament. Chambers, Shaw, Stones and Berahino, who have all experienced Under-21 football under Southgate, are expected to be named in Southgate’s squad next summer. Sterling, Jones, Wilshere and Oxlade-Chamberlain are all eligible, but are unlikely to be considered unless they make it known to Southgate that they wish to be involved. Luke Shaw, in action against the Scots in Glasgow,  has experienced Under 21 football under Southgate . Hodgson added: ‘If Gareth thinks the best way to win the tournament is to jettison a lot of the players he has been working with and take players from our team then that is fine by me, too. ‘He will be under no pressure from me whatsoever. We can deal with four or five absentees. ‘We have two senior games in June and it also would mean that any senior players playing in the tournament in the Czech Republic will be playing three tournaments in a row in the summer without a break. West Brom striker Saido Berahino has starred for the England Under-21 side this year . ‘The clubs’ co-operation when it comes to selecting players is always important. As far as I understand, the FIFA rules gives us the right to choose whatever players we want. ‘Whether the clubs will be happy with us choosing them, that’s another matter. But luckily it’s not my choice. ‘I will have a choice after Gareth’s selection of the players I want to take to play against Ireland and in Slovenia. I can assure that we will have 11 players on the field on both occasions.'","Calum Chambers, Luke Shaw, John Stones and Saido Berahino have all experienced Under 21 football under Gareth Southgate .

"Lukas Podolski's international future is in jeopardy if he doesn't quit Arsenal in January. The German international is on the peripheries of Arsene Wenger's plans, and has hardly featured for the Gunners this season. And Germany boss Joachim Low has warned Podolski his place in the international set-up will come under threat if he isn't playing regularly. Lukas Podolski has made just four appearances for Arsenal this season, all have come from the bench . Podolski has already admitted he is open to leaving the Emirates Stadium due to his lack of playing time. And Low's words of warning is likely to push the German closer to the Arsenal exit door. He said last week: 'Of course I am not happy with my situation right now. I can’ t be satisfied with that. Germany boss Joachim Low told Podolski he has to play for his club if he wants to play for the national side . 'We’ll see what happens in January. It is hard when you can’t do what you love. 'I don’t know why that is, you’d have to ask my coach in England . 'If you can't play then you can't say he's not playing well or he has a crisis if you're not given the chance.

"After England strolled to victory at Celtic Park on Tuesday night, it was fitting that Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain should take a leisurely stroll through the countryside on his down day. Oxlade-Chamberlain got England off to a great start in Glasgow when he nodded in Jack Wilshere’s superb long ball to put the visitors ahead in the 32nd minute.

"Football fans have always found cutting ways to mock the tastes and foibles of their rivals, usually through clever songs and chants. But how much do they actually know about those who stand on the other side of the fence? What do they buy? What do they watch and listen to? How do they vote? What makes them tick? Well, a detailed survey of over 200,000 people by pollsters YouGov could hold the answers. They have pulled together a searchable database that tells you the favourite food, hobbies, personality, fashion tastes, car preference, Twitter follow list and general favourite things of football fans. And, it's fair to say, some of the results are pretty illuminating. Here's a cross-section of just some of the clubs featured. The YouGov survey of over 200,000 people helped to build up a profile of football fans and their tastes . ARSENAL . ASTON VILLA . BURNLEY . CHELSEA . CRYSTAL PALACE . EVERTON . HULL CITY . LEICESTER CITY . LIVERPOOL . MANCHESTER CITY . MANCHESTER UNITED . NEWCASTLE UNITED . QUEENS PARK RANGERS . SOUTHAMPTON . STOKE CITY . SUNDERLAND . SWANSEA CITY . TOTTENHAM HOTSPUR . WEST BROMWICH ALBION . WEST HAM UNITED . ARSENAL FANS SHOP AT WAITROSE AND JOHN LEWIS... AND STILL LIKE ROBIN VAN PERSIE . Gunners fans like the finer things in life, the survey finds, and enjoy spending their £1,000+ monthly pocket money at upmarket stores like Waitrose and John Lewis. They're generally well cultured and informed, reading the Economist, playing chess, eating Coq au Vin and having an interest in world affairs, business and finance, and fashion and design. When on Twitter, they like to keep up to date with former striker Robin van Persie, now at Manchester United, and Gooner Piers Morgan. The survey revealed that Arsenal fans still follow former striker Robin van Persie on Twitter . MAN UNITED FANS LOVE WATCHING SOAPS... AND CAN BE FUSSY . YouGov found Manchester United fans to be celebrity-obsessed and TV addicts who enjoy watching Coronation Street, Emmerdale and Eastenders. Amusingly, the survey found that their favourite TV show is live coverage of the Champions League (even though their team isn't in it this season). Contrary to popular belief, most do come from the north-west. They're dedicated but can sometimes be fussy and demanding, presumably if the team isn't winning. Man United fans enjoy watching Coronation Street, Emmerdale and EastEnders on the box . LIVERPOOL FANS HAVE A SENSE OF HUMOUR... AND LIKE THEIR BEAUTY PRODUCTS . The personality section of the survey revealed Liverpool fans like to use beauty products to keep themselves looking good. They pride themselves on their wit, are likely to watch the X Factor, read celebrity magazines and love a pan of scouse. Former Anfield favourite Mark Lawrenson is rated as their favourite personality. Liverpool fans are funny... but like wearing lots of beauty products . CHELSEA FANS LIKE WATCHING JEREMY KYLE AND LOVE A BARGAIN . There's some pretty dubious TV  tastes in this survey but Chelsea fans surely top the list with the Jeremy Kyle Show and Peter Andre's 60 Minute Makeover. They also love their TV talent shows too, with Cheryl Cole, Gary Barlow, Simon Cowell and Tulisa making the celebrities list. Blues fans also enjoy dancing, own cats, drive Toyotas and hunt down the best deals when out shopping, the survey said. Chelsea fans like their TV talent shows and the personalities in them, according to the YouGov poll . NEWCASTLE FANS ARE GREAT COMPANY DOWN THE PUB AND ARE PROUD OF THEIR ROOTS . The Geordies come out pretty favourably in this survey and are good listeners and good company, especially over a few drinks. They love a pasty from Greggs followed by rice pudding, like a round of golf in their spare time and have dogs as pets. Newcastle fans like to keep up with the local news - with Look North among their favourite TV shows and the Chronicle bookmarked on their browsers. Newcastle fans are good company, especially over a pint, but can sometimes by grumpy . MILLWALL FANS ARE CONFRONTATIONAL, RIGHT-WING AND LIKE BOXING (AND BUTTER) Millwall supporters tend to be pre-judged more than most and the survey does seem to support many of the common preconceptions. They vote for right-wing parties in the election, like watching boxing, can be confrontational and intolerant, and think the country is going to the dogs. On the plus side, they have plenty of spare cash and dress in Ralph Lauren. Bizarrely, the favourite brands section features four types of butter. Millwall fans are profiled as having plenty of spare cash and are generally men under 40 . THRIFTY LEEDS UNITED FANS ARE BARMY ABOUT YORKSHIRE . The main thing that comes across from the Leeds United fans surveyed is their love for their county. They'll support Leeds Rhinos and Yorkshire CCC, keep up to date with local news and live up to their reputation for sticking to a strict budget. Amusingly, the chief traits from the Leeds fans is that they're 'barmy' and 'straight-forward.' Leeds United fans will also follow their local rugby league and cricket teams, the survey found . CELTIC FANS ARE POLITICALLY-CHARGED, BIG-HEARTED AND PARTIAL TO A BIT OF ROD STEWART . Some very interesting views emerged from the Celtic survey, including 'the world is controlled by a secretive elite,' 'the United States is the greatest single threat to world peace' and 'basically, Marx was right.' That aside, they consider themselves big-hearted, compassionate and constructive, if occasionally grumpy and fussy. There will probably be a bit of Rod Stewart, a Celtic fan, on their iPods and they spend plenty of time on Facebook. The Celtic fans questioned by YouGov threw up some interesting political statements . RANGERS FANS HAVE GIVEN UP ON EATING HEALTHILY AND ENJOY WATCHING 'HOMES UNDER THE HAMMER' One of the opinions most commonly expressed by Gers fans is that they don't bother with diets and exercise. This checks out with the selection of Scottish delicacies in the favourite food list. They'll spend in excess of 50 hours a week watching the TV, with 'Homes Under The Hammer' cropping up twice in the recently watched shows list. Video games seem to be the principal source of amusement and their favourite fashion label is Ben Sherman.

"He may be under pressure following an indifferent start to the season with Manchester City, but Yaya Toure heads up a five-man shortlist for 2014 BBC African Footballer of the Year. Toure, who won the Premier League this year with Manchester City, is joined by Ivory Coast team-mate and former Arsenal attacker Gervinho. Now at Roma, Gervinho has become an integral part of Rudi Garcia's team, regularly showing an assured touch in front of goal that deserted him in Arsenal colours. The duo will face strong competition from Gabon international Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, who enjoyed an exceptional first year at Borussia Dortmund.

"At the start of the season there were question marks over Jack Wilshere and when Roy Hodgson asked him to play slightly deeper in the England midfield people wondered whether he would be up to the mark. From what we've seen so far, he's making us re-evaluate him as player. Let's be clear that it's very early days and his real tests in what is a very demanding position are yet to come. But from what we've seen so far, he has every right to be encouraged by the way he has adapted to the role. Wilshere is showing skills and facets of his game which we haven't seen before. It's actually making him a better player. I've always thought that he needed to play the ball earlier and quicker than he sometimes has done with Arsenal; playing in this role, he is forced to do exactly that. England midfielder Jack Wilshere (right) slides in to make a tackle on Slovenia's Jasmin Kurtic . Arsene Wenger has him down as a box-to-box midfielder and we typically think of him bursting down the pitch. But he's looking for the early pass now. He has to look forward quicker, is releasing the ball earlier and is hitting passes over the back of people. He's now looking for Wayne Rooney and they are developing a bit of a relationship. Rooney now knows if he makes good movement, Jack will pick him out. I thought Wilshere was England's best player on Saturday, though the real test of whether he is up to playing in that position will be when we are up against better teams and he is playing against a top quality No 10. At the moment, in this Euro 2016 qualifying group, England will enjoy a lot of possession, which means Wilshere gets to see a lot of the ball. It's an ideal scenario to learn the role. We need to wait to see how he does when we're defending for long periods against top quality teams. Against Portugal, Germany, Spain or Italy we're not going to dominate possession. Then his defensive skills and movement will be tested and that will be a challenge. But for now, I've been very impressed. Wilshere (above) can spend too much time on the ball when playing for Arsenal . Wilshere doesn't back down during an argument with Slovenia's Bostjan Cesar at Wembley on Saturday . Obviously, as a whole, England's performance started slowly and ended well. There was a real lack of movement in the first half and no spark at all. It was all very methodical. England had plenty of ball possession but didn't create nearly enough. Clearly something would have been said at half-time to change that. Maybe not stern words, but Roy Hodgson and his team got the message across, even if Slovenia scored first through Jordan Henderson's own goal. There was more intensity to England's game throughout the second half. Rooney was good, if not brilliant, on the occasion of his 100th cap. You couldn't really have asked much more from a captain than the manner in which he took the game to Slovenia in the immediate aftermath of England conceding. Arsenal midfielder Wilshere tries to get away from from Slovenia players after being surrounded . His character was evident as he collected the ball and got into them and then his skill and movement was excellent to win the penalty. Scoring it capped a great day for him. Nathaniel Clyne did OK but needs to get closer to club form and though Raheem Sterling is not back to his form of last season, he was part of the reason why we got stronger in the game. He was bogged down in the first half but the move to put him out wide right in the second and to stretch the game a little gave us a lot more width and helped simplify his game. Overall, it's difficult to assess the future using these games as a barometer of England's form. Tournament football will be very different to the qualification phase and England won't be allowed nearly as much possession. They will have to use the friendlies much more as a test of how they're improving and perhaps the Scotland game — if we can call any game against Scotland a friendly — is useful in that regard. Nathaniel Clyne needs to get close to club form when playing for the England side . Wilshere, pictured applauding England's support at Wembley, is adapting to his defensive role in midfield . Maybe Hodgson will rest a few players, maybe Ross Barkley will get a run but, overall, the game comes at a good time. Scotland won't want to sit back at home against England as most of their opponents do. The game will have passion, intensity and the defence will be stretched a lot more. On Saturday evening ended up positively with England on the front foot. But Tuesday night will be a step into the unknown for some of these young players. Hodgson will learn a little bit more about his team at Celtic Park and perhaps that will begin to give us a real idea as to whether they have moved on from the World Cup. Everton midfielder Ross Barkley will be hoping to get a run out against Scotland on Tuesday .","England beat Slovenia 3-1 at Wembley in their Euro 2016 qualifier .

"Clearly, as an Englishman, I will be hoping we can put one over on the Scots on Tuesday night at Celtic Park in the world’s oldest international football fixture. But part of me will be supporting at least one Scottish player. When I first met Ikechi Anya he was a very raw 19-year-old, low on confidence but with loads of ability. He was playing for Halesowen Town in the Midland League and stacking shelves at Tesco during the day. But the last time I was in touch with him was a couple of months ago after he scored for Scotland against world champions Germany. His story is incredible and an inspiration to young players who think that being rejected by a club means the end of their dreams. ‘Kechi’ was in just that situation. He had been released by Wycombe as a 17-year-old and spent 18 months out of the professional game. VIDEO Scroll down to see Anya dazzle on Scottish training pitch . Ikechi Anya scored for Scotland against Germany in their opening Euro 2016 qualifier in September . Watford winger Anya has become a Scotland regular under manager Gordon Strachan . Wycombe Wanderers (2004-07) Oxford City (2007-08) Halesowen Town (2008) Northampton Town (2009) Sevilla Atletico (2009-10) Celta B (2010-11) Celta (2011) Granada (2011-13) Cadiz - loan (2011-12) Watford - loan (2012-13) Watford (2013-present) At the time, I was helping to set up an academy in Jerez where we would pick up the rejects from professional clubs and see if we could get them back into the game with some intensive coaching and education. My former assistant, John Gorman, had known him at Wycombe. So when we were holding trials for our academy, we tracked him down and asked him along. He thought that at 19 he was too old and his chance had gone. But he showed that he had blistering pace as a right winger. And all of the coaches there — Graham Rix, Nigel Spackman, Dave Beasant, myself and John — recognised there was some raw material with which we could work. We took him down to the academy in Jerez in southern Spain and he was with us for eight or nine months. There we developed him as a footballer and taught him about movement, positioning and how to use his pace. We also had to work on giving him some self-belief. He couldn’t see in himself what we could see — and many of the lads down there were like that, given that their confidence had taken a big knock from being rejected. I used to joke with him that he was banned from the treatment room as he would often worry about an injury that was holding him back. Of course, players need proper treatment for their injuries, but with Kechi it was a case of giving him a more positive outlook, so that every muscle tweak did not become an issue that resulted in him being out for a few weeks. Hopefully, we made him realise he had the talent — but he was the one who put the hard work in. He had the hunger and wanted to do it and just needed re-shaping a little mentally and tactically. He was always ready to listen and take advice on board. Anya had to play for sides such as Halesowen Town and Northampton before joining Watford . The 26-year-old starred in Scotland's recent 1-0 win against the Republic of Ireland at Celtic Park . One day we played against Sevilla’s B team and drew 1-1 and he absolutely tore them apart. They instantly wanted to have a look at him again. He went back for another game and again looked incredible — so they signed him on a two-year contract and he became the first player to leave the academy with a professional contract. He played for Sevilla’s B team and then made some appearances for the first team before moving on to Celta. His progress since then has been superb and he ended up with Granada, before being loaned to Watford, where he is now doing so well. We were all very proud when he made his Scotland debut last year although he actually qualifies for four different countries, having a Nigerian father, a Romanian mother, was born in Scotland and raised in England. That night he scored against Germany in September, everyone from the academy were texting each other — and Kechi was in touch with us as well after the game. Anya plied his trade at Football League outfit Northampton Town before his spell out in Spain . Glenn Hoddle and John Gorman coached Anya when they were running an academy out in Spain . I wouldn’t want to be too hard on the clubs which release these players — there can be a multitude of reasons why they are deemed not good enough at 16 or 17. In Kechi’s case, he had a bad injury and was playing catch-up at that age. You might not be physically mature enough at 17 but completely different physically at 21. Perhaps the player doesn’t fit the style the manager wants. It may well drag you down at that young age if you get the idea the club isn’t positive about you. In fact, so much can go against you. Clubs have to release players — they can’t take everyone on. But my point is that many of those we initially discard can go on to enjoy good professional careers with a little guidance and help. Unfortunately, the academy we were running in Spain could not get the long-term funding and eventually had to close. But I still wonder if it’s an idea that the Premier League, FA and Professional Footballers’ Association might revive over here. I’m sure it would be self-funding eventually if you were producing young players like Kechi. He is living proof that you can be cast on to football’s scrapheap far too soon. And that for those who are, with help, there is a way back — even a route to international football and the chance to score against the world champions.","Watford ace Ikechi Anya was released by Wycombe as a 17-year-old .

"Wayne Rooney does not rank alongside the world's 'greatest players' Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo and he has failed to fully 'maximise his potential', say Glenn Hoddle and Lee Dixon. The England captain won his 100th cap for the Three Lions during Saturday's 2016 European Championship qualifier against Slovenia at Wembley. Yet former England coach Hoddle and ex-Three Lions full back Dixon believe his 'great' career has not been quite as fantastic as many thought it would be when he broke on to the scene more than a decade ago.

Ex-England coach Glenn Hoddle (left) and former Three Lions full back Lee Dixon were not full of praise for England captain Rooney, saying he has failed to fulfil his full potential and is not one of the world's best . Speaking on ITV before the match, Dixon explained that Rooney's best position is still unclear despite receiving a century of caps - which is not something you associate with the world's greats. He said: '(There were) huge expectations on him (Rooney). He was a talent straight from day one and I think everyone put a lot of pressure on him, including himself. 'Has he maximised his potential compared to how good he was when he was young? I think you'd have to say he hasn't. 'He's now won 100 caps but we still don't know what his best position is which is not what you associate with the game's greats, although he has achieved great things throughout his career.' Hoddle, meanwhile, does not think Rooney ranks alongside the best players in the world and believes the Manchester United forward could even improve in the future. He explained: 'He's had a great, great career but whether he's one of the greatest in the world alongside Messi and Ronaldo, I think he's just behind that. 'I think he can actually improve on his performances (in the future).' England skipper Rooney receive the above cap for his 100th international appearance on Saturday . Rooney  in action during his England debut in 2003 against Australia, when he first broke on to the scene . Rooney's former team-mate Steven Gerrard and England coach Gary Neville were quick to praise the 29-year-old, however. Neville said: 'What's a great (player)? (Rooney's been in) three European Cup finals, won five or six Premier League titles, he's England captain - I wouldn't have wanted more than that as a kid. 'He's Bryan Robson up front for me. Sometimes our problem (as an England set-up) with Rooney is he works too hard - he needs to make these next few years the best of his career.' And Gerrard was also effusive in his praise for the striker: 'A few players operate on a different level and Wayne is one of them because he can do magical things. '(The pressure on him) is his own fault for being so good. I'm just hoping he's going to be that person who is going to make all the fans happy at a tournament.'

"England manager Roy Hodgson refused to be drawn on calls for a potential boycott of the World Cup. The calls come after former Football Association chairman David Bernstein urged European nations to boycott the next World Cup - due to be staged in Russia in 2018 - unless world governing body FIFA undergoes serious reform. The football governing body is firmly under the spotlight again following the release of a report on Thursday by the chairman of the adjudicatory chamber of their ethics committee which cleared Russia and Qatar to host the 2018 and 2022 tournaments, having found no serious breaches of bidding rules by either nation. Ex-FA chairman David Bernstein has called on European nations including England to skip the 2018 World Cup . Bernstein (pictured) believes boycotting the tournament could help force FIFA into much-needed reform . Michael Garcia, who conducted the investigation on which Thursday's report was based but whose full report has not been made public, has appealed against the version released by FIFA. Allegations of corruption - strenuously denied - continue to be levelled against the Qatar 2022 and Russia 2018 bid teams. Speaking on Monday ahead of the Three Lions' clash with Scotland at Celtic Park, Hodgson said: ' 'I'm afraid I'm not prepared to comment on that. I was briefed very quickly about it before I came here but what's important to me is the match tomorrow night so I'll allow the people at the FA to answer those questions. 'I'll just stick to the task of a football coach rather than a football administrator.' Michael Garcia has appealed against the version of his report into the bidding process released by FIFA .

"Jenson Button and Kevin Magnussen will have to wait until after the first of December for their futures to finally be resolved. McLaren have confirmed there will be no announcement prior to that date, leaving the duo in limbo for another fortnight. Group chief executive Ron Dennis stated over the course of the Italian Grand Prix weekend in early September he would deliver his decision before the season's end. VIDEO Scroll down to go behind the scenes at McLaren HQ with Jenson Button . Jenson Button (left) and Kevin Magnussen will have to wait until December to discover their McLaren future . At the time, Dennis said: 'As for a decision (on driver line-up), it certainly won't be in the next few days and it won't be at the end of the season, it will be something in between.' Dennis, however, has now reneged on such comments as, via their Twitter feed, McLaren said: 'Guys, we know you're awaiting news on our driver line-up. We'll announce after Dec 1 - you'll hear it here first. All eyes now on Abu Dhabi.' Fernando Alonso is expected to return to the Woking-based team from 2015 when Honda become power-unit partners, with this weekend's race in Abu Dhabi ending the marque's 20-season association with Mercedes-Benz. Button produced a fourth-placed finish at the Brazilian Grand Prix and has one podium this season . Magnussen is on 55 points in the drivers' standings, but his team-mate Button has 106 . The choice for the second seat comes down to a straight fight between veteran Button and young Dane Magnussen, now approaching the end of his first year in F1. Racing director Eric Boullier is understood to favour Button given his experience, which in tandem with Alonso would help drive on Honda, whilst Dennis prefers Magnussen. Via a statement, McLaren added: 'Selecting the optimal driver line-up for a Formula One team is clearly an important process, and it is therefore one that requires precise and prolonged analysis. 'That being the case, and in order to avoid distracting the race team from its primary objective during the final grand prix weekend of the season, which is to secure the best possible on-track results, we have decided to defer our final deliberations relating to our 2015 driver line-up until a date no earlier than Monday December 1st.'","McLaren will announce driver line-up for next season in December .

"Mercedes motorsport boss Toto Wolff is planning a quick resolution to Lewis Hamilton's future once this weekend's Formula One title decider is resolved. Wolff has long made it clear he wants Hamilton to remain at Mercedes by signing an extension to a contract that expires at the end of next year. Wolff, however, has previously further stated he would not allow any talks to impact on Hamilton's focus whilst he fights with team-mate Nico Rosberg for a championship that has gone down to the wire. VIDEO Scroll down to join Hamilton on a lap of Abu Dhabi's Yas Marina circuit . Lewis Hamilton's contract with Mercedes runs out at the end of 2015 Formula One season . Hamilton (far left) goes in to the final race of the season knowing that a second-place finish will clinch the title . Hamilton heads into Sunday's race at the Yas Marina circuit with a 17-point cushion over Rosberg and knows a top-two finish is all he requires to claim a second title. Come early next week, Wolff will then sit down with Hamilton and, he hopes, get him to put pen to paper on a new deal. 'We very much want him to stay for many more years,' said Wolff. 'He's great for the team, part of the family and the relationship we all enjoy is more than a professional racing relationship between driver and team. 'It is on a different level and so our wish would very much be for that to continue for many more years. 'Of course, we agreed with each other not to sit down at a table and negotiate terms of a contract and numbers when what Lewis needed was to concentrate on his driving. Toto Wolff (front far right) is keen for Hamilton to extend his contract after the championship finishes . Nico Rosberg (near) pipped Hamilton to victory at the Brazilian GP to set up a nail-biting season finale . 'We did that very consciously, even when the rumours accelerated around other drivers and our team. 'We sat down again and said 'should we maybe take those conversations forward?' We decided it was not the best thing to do. 'So on the Monday or Tuesday after Abu Dhabi we will sit down and discuss and hopefully find a solution quickly.' Wolff and non-executive chairman Niki Lauda will now be dealing with Hamilton directly rather than via management company XIX Entertainment after the 29-year-old recently opted to drop Simon Fuller's organisation. Wolff feels that will not pose a problem, adding: 'Lewis is a very intelligent and mature person now who knows more about Formula One than many other managers out there. 'I think he can represent himself in a good way, he has good support from consultants, be it legal, tax or whatever, so he has a good set-up around him and he's a very clever guy. Hamilton's team-mate Rosberg (right) is 17 points behind the Brit going into Sunday's race . Wolff said he hopes Hamilton stays at Mercedes for 'many more years' 'We have discussions around various topics very regularly. Last week, for example, we spent an hour discussing various commercial issues. 'He knows what he wants and is straight about it, so I think that is not at all detrimental to him. On the contrary it is more efficient for us.' As far as Wolff is concerned, that is all part of the development of Hamilton's character he has noticed since his arrival at the team. 'It is the way he has matured over the last two years, the way he has grown into the team,' assessed Wolff. 'He feels in a better place in his life, that he has sorted out some of his private issues. 'He also has a good relationship with the team, he feels at home and the personalities with whom he deals with have been open to him. 'Then there is the valuable contribution he brings to the team, not only as a racing driver, but as someone who motivates by embracing the team and giving us valuable inputs on the commercial side. I respect that a lot. 'The development of Lewis' personality has been quite astonishing.'","Lewis Hamilton's Mercedes contract expires at the end of next year .

"FIFA president Sepp Blatter has rejected FA chairman Greg Dyke's call to publish the Garcia report into allegations of corruption in World Cup bidding. Blatter has replied to a letter from Dyke, saying publishing the report would break FIFA's rules and Swiss law. Ethics investigator Michael Garcia has compiled a 430-page report into the bidding for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups, won by Russia and Qatar, but FIFA ethics judge Hans-Joachim Eckert has cleared the countries to host the tournaments. FIFA president Sepp Blatter announces Qatar as the hosts for the 2022 World Cup in December 2010 but insists he will not make public the Garcia report into possible corruption during the proces . FA chairman Greg Dyke has written to every FIFA executive committee member about the corruption report and he demanded that football's world governing body made the report public but that has been rejected . Football's world governing body has come under enormous scrutiny after its handling of the World Cup vote . Blatter's reply to Dyke states: 'FIFA would violate not only its own rules and regulations but also Swiss law by making public the report in question.' And Blatter says every person in the report would have to give consent to publication - something that would be practically impossible. The FIFA president adds: 'We have been advised that publication of the report might be permissible if the persons and entities included in the report consent to such publication and waive any legal action they might be entitled to bring.'

"Neymar has everything needed to eclipse the talents of Lionel Messi and be heralded as the greatest player on the planet, believes 1994 Brazil World Cup winner Romario. Neymar played an integral part in the tournament hosts' run to the World Cup semi-finals this summer, scoring four goals before suffering a back injury in their quarter-final win against Colombia. In the 22-year-old's absence, the five-time World Cup winners were thumped 7-1 against eventual winners Germany - who beat a Messi-led Argentina 1-0 in the final after extra-time. Neymar has everything needed to succeed Lionel Messi's and become a better player, says Romario . And Romario believes this summer's defeat at the Maracana, could have been Messi's best chance of winning the tournament while citing the fact Neymar still has time on his side to leave a lasting legacy on the world's biggest stage before he retires. 'He has everything to be bigger than Messi,' the legendary striker said of his compatriot in an interview with Revista Trip. 'Messi is already a part of history but Neymar can make an even bigger impact. 'Messi may not have another World Cup in which to compete and win, but Neymar has three or four more to contest.'

"MATT LAWTON: Malky Mackay and Iain Moody investigated by FA over 'sexist, racist and homophobic' text messages during time at Cardiff . Shamed manager Malky Mackay has walked into a new job with the threat of the sack already hanging over him if an ongoing FA investigation leads to charges over his sexist, racist and homophobic exchange of texts. Mackay, who was unveiled as manager of Championship strugglers Wigan Athletic, was dismissed by Cardiff City 11 months ago. A Sportsmail investigation subsequently uncovered evidence of racist and homophobic texts exchanged with his former director of football, Iain Moody.

Wigan chairman Dave Whelan revealed Mackay’s rolling contract includes a clause that protects the club in case the FA end up punishing their new manager. The FA investigation is still two or three weeks away from completion and while disciplinary officials have to decide whether to differentiate between public and private communication, the most senior officials at Wembley want to see action taken. At the same time, a Cardiff investigation into eight transfers completed during Mackay’s tenure is also ongoing. At the unveiling Whelan said: ‘We have spoken to the FA. I don’t think there is anything in the pipeline with the investigation but it’s in the contract (with Mackay), we are protecting the club. ‘I did ask Malky questions about the problems he’s had on the racist thing. He admits what he did and apologised for what he said. I accept that totally. ‘I think Malky has been so unlucky. He has done a little bit wrong and has apologised for it. It’s not like we are all saints.’ In one of the texts, Mackay, 42, described his former Cardiff owner Vincent Tan as ‘a chink’ and others referred to women, Jews and ethnic minorities in extremely derogatory terms. The Scottish boss was sacked as Cardiff manager last season and had yet to return to football . As Mackay was being unveiled in the North West, anti-racism organisation Kick It Out criticised Wigan’s appointment, saying: ‘Wigan have disregarded the ongoing investigation being undertaken by the FA, and any potential punishment Mackay may face, by taking the decision to appoint him. ‘We need to see leadership and a respect for the processes in place shown by football club owners to demonstrate how seriously they take tackling issues of exclusion, prejudice and discrimination.’ Coincidentally, Kick It Out staged an equality and diversity session for Wigan’s apprentices yesterday. Local MP Lisa Nandy had previously written to Whelan asking him not to consider Mackay as a replacement for Uwe Rosler, who was sacked a week ago. Whelan said he believes Mackay is 'the man to lead us back to the Premier League' Mackay acted in a contrite manner, saying he would continue to attend an educational programme to further improve his behaviour and attitude. And he insisted his door was open to any Wigan player who was uncomfortable with his appointment. ‘I have spoken to a lot of people in education, diversity and equality programmes. It will be ongoing with me for the rest of my life in terms of becoming a more rounded person and better manager,’ he said. ‘My style as a manager is hands-on in terms of developing relationships and enabling my players to knock on my door and talk to me.’ Mackay will meet the Wigan players for the first time on Thursday and his first match in charge will be at home to Middlesbrough on Saturday.

"Serena Williams won her third-successive WTA Finals title and fifth overall by beating Simona Halep 6-3, 6-0 on Sunday, avenging an embarrassing group-stage loss to the Romanian player. Halep easily beat Williams just four days earlier during the group stage of the tournament, but the American turned that around with an aggressive game plan. Williams won 11 of the last 12 games in the match to join Martina Navratilova and Steffi Graf as the only players to have won five titles in the season-ending championships. Serena Williams holds aloft the trophy after winning the WTA Finals in Singapore . The world No 1 has equalled Steffi Graf and Martina Navratilova by winning the event five times . Williams shakes hands with Simona Halep after winning the final for the loss of only three games . The 33-year-old pulled out of her previous two tournaments with illness and a knee injury, yet still claimed the £1.2million first prize, claimed the Billie-Jean King Trophy and also had a breed of orchid named after her in recognition. 'I just started training, because I had such a bad knee in Beijing I didn't know if I'd be able to play here, and now I have won the Billie-Jean King trophy - I am so excited,' Williams said. The match was the most one-sided championship match in the WTA Finals since Kim Clijsters beat Amelie Mauresmo 6-2, 6-0 in 2003. Williams changed her approach from the group-stage contest, attacking Halep's second serve with fierce ground strokes, and regularly rushing the net to cut the points short and prevent her opponent from playing her preferred style. 'I had to play more Serena-style tennis and just do what I do best,' Williams said. 'I was expecting a much better player than I was in the earlier round. Being ready for that really was able to help me out.' Williams returned to a more attacking style of play after losing to Halep in the group stages . Two young fans show a message of support to Williams during the final at the Singapore Sports Hub . Halep's run in this tournament capped a remarkable rise, having gone from No. 64 in the rankings to No.4 in the course of 17 months, with a French Open final appearance along the way. However, her relative lack of experience of big occasions compared to the 18-time Grand Slam champion proved telling. 'I was nervous before the match that I had to play this big final,' Halep said. 'I couldn't manage very well the situation. 'I knew that she would be more motivated during this match because we played a few days ago and I won.' Williams pumps her fist as she closes in on her third consecutive victory at the WTA Final . Halep has experienced a rapid rise up the rankings but admits nerves got the better of her . The irony of Sunday's match was that Halep had it within her power to deny Williams a place in the final. Halep went into her final group-stage game knowing that if she lost in straight sets, Ana Ivanovic would go into the semifinals at Williams' expense. Instead, Halep lost in three and Williams made it in. 'I have no regrets because I did my job on court against Ivanovic,' Halep said. 'That was the chance but she deserves to win the title. She's much better.' Williams said she would have done the same thing if in Halep's shoes, namely try to win the group game despite the temptation of knocking out her most dangerous rival. 'No one on the tour thinks like that,' Williams said. 'She definitely gives her all so I don't think that went through her mind at all.' Williams shares a joke with women's tennis legend Billie Jean King, who has the trophy named after her . The American embraces her coach Patrick Mouratoglou after securing the end of year No 1 ranking . Halep got the first break of the match in the third game and was up 40-0 on serve in the next and looked capable of repeating the surprise 6-0, 6-2 victory over Williams on Wednesday. However, Williams broke back in that fourth game and the course of the match was changed. Halep won only three points fewer than Williams in the opening set but clinched just seven points in the entire second set - including only two on return. The set was over in just 25 minutes. Halep's serve, so effective throughout the tournament, let her down on the big stage where she won fewer than half her first-serve points while Williams won 77 percent. Halep tried in vain to change the momentum, even trying a drop shot from well behind the baseline, but her spirit and body language quickly deteriorated in the face of Williams' relentless attack. Cara Black (L) and Sania Mirza won the doubles event in their last ever tournament together as a pair . Williams had 25 winners against just five by her opponent. Halep's victory in the group stage ended Williams' 16-game winning streak at the WTA Finals, but the American built her career win-loss record in the championships that feature the top eight players to 29 wins and five losses. Williams also retained the season-end top ranking, taking that honor for the fourth time. The doubles final was even more one-sided with Cara Black and Sania Mirza - in their last match together as a pairing - routing defending champions Peng Shuai and Hsieh Su-Wei 6-1, 6-0.","Serena Williams defeated Simona Halep 6-3, 6-0 to win WTA Finals .

"Their World Cups could not have been any more contrasting - Spain surrendered their crown by bombing out in the group stages while Germany went all the way, beating Argentina in the Maracana final. Four months on, ahead of their friendly in Vigo, we assess what's happened to both nations since the summer and whether they've progressed or gone backwards. Germany captain Philipp Lahm lifts the World Cup after their 1-0 win over Argentina in the Maracana final . Mario Gotze runs away in celebration after scoring his extra time winner against Argentina in the final . Spain, by contrast, were a shadow of their former selves and crashed out in the World Cup group stage . Andres Iniesta and Iker Casillas react gloomily after Spain lost 2-0 to Chile at the World Cup . THE RESULTS . SPAIN . Spain fell to their first qualification defeat in eight years when they lost to Slovakia last month and coming after a miserable 1-0 loss to France in a friendly straight after the World Cup the gloom has taken a time to lift. But beating Luxembourg 4-0 and Belarus 3-0 in their last two games have restored faith that while things will never be quite the same again, Spain can go into France 2016 as one of the favourites for the tournament. Much of the renewed excitement comes from the performance of Isco in that last game. Spain lost their first qualification match in eight years against Slovakia last month . Spain currently sit behind Slovakia in Euro qualifying Group C . GERMANY . After the euphoric high of winning the World Cup out in Brazil, a hangover was always to be expected and so it has proved. Argentina, who were beaten by Mario Gotze's extra time goal in the final, gained a small measure of revenge when they won 4-2 in a Dusseldorf friendly back in August. Germany trailed 4-0 at one stage, with Angel Di Maria in exceptional form. Qualifying for the European Championships started in a similarly unconvincing vein as they scraped past Scotland 2-1 thanks to a couple of Thomas Muller goals before a few shortcomings were exposed in a 2-0 loss to Poland. Low was left fuming after John O'Shea's stoppage time goal earned the Republic of Ireland a point in their third qualifier and there were still a few murmurings of discontent when Germany 'only' put four past minnows Gibraltar the other night. John O'Shea (left) celebrates his last-minute equaliser for the Republic of Ireland against Germany last month . Germany find themselves behind Poland four matches in to qualifying Group D . MANAGER . SPAIN . Vicente del Bosque kept his job after a World Cup campaign that he himself described as disastrous. Now he has to prove that he is the best man to help Spain to defend the European crown they won under his management in 2012. He is fiercely loyal by nature so there has been a tendency toward evolution over revolution but slowly but surely the new Spain is taking shape. In France 2016 he, along with the likes of Iker Casillas, Andres Iniesta and David Silva want a glorious swan-song that will erase memories of that Brazil nightmare. Vicente del Bosque kept his job as Spain coach despite the World Cup debacle and must now rebuild . GERMANY . Germany's triumph out in Brazil was a glorious vindication of Joachim Low's philosophy and methods, but the manager has been frustrated by the fall in standards since. Low, a perfectionist, has seen his team affected by somewhat inevitable lapses in concentration since their Maracana win and restoring professional focus is his No 1 priority. The expanded format for Euro 2016 hasn't helped his cause, with Germany pretty much assured of qualification whatever they do. It must be a massive comedown to play these routine qualifiers after the high-pressure games of the World Cup. The World Cup-winning squad have naturally assumed a huge celebrity profile - as shown by the red carpet premiere of 'Die Mannschaft', a film about their Brazil triumph, in Berlin this week - and Low's greatest challenge now is to ensure they keep their minds on the football. Joachim Low has been far from impressed by Germany's performances since their World Cup triumph . PLAYERS . SPAIN . It was Del Bosque who persuaded Diego Costa to switch allegiance; the Brazilian born striker has not made it easy for his manager since then. First he failed to score at the World Cup, then having taken a total of 515 minutes to get off the mark he pulls out of the next squad, despite being fit to play for Chelsea against Liverpool. For now Del Bosque is sticking with the idea of building the team around him with young talents such as Real Madrid’s Isco and Valencia’s Paco Alcacer in a supporting role. Atletico Madrid’s Koke also has a huge role having been handed the ‘Xavi baton’ in midfield. Striker Diego Costa took 515 minutes to score his first goal for Spain, in contrast to his Chelsea form . Real Madrid's Isco has impressed and offered optimism that Spain's golden era might not yet be over . GERMANY . There were always going to be some players wanting to end their international careers on a high and stalwarts Philipp Lahm, Per Mertesacker and Miroslav Klose all announced their retirements. Bastian Schweinsteiger, appointed Lahm's successor as captain, has been on the sidelines with a knee injury and has only just returned to training with Bayern Munich. But though these pillars of the side have been absent, Germany are not exactly short of world class talent and Low has started to bring a few new players through. With Mats Hummels injured at the start of the season, his Borussia Dortmund clubmate Matthias Ginter has been deployed and left-back Erik Durm, also of Dortmund, has been given his chance too. Christoph Kramer, who started the World Cup final after Sami Khedira's injury only to be himself taken off with a head injury, has added to his caps. Low has also used Hoffenheim midfielder Sebastian Rudy and has great faith in Bayer Leverkusen winger Karim Bellarabi, who has started the last three qualifiers. Other more established names have been ineffective, including the out-of-luck Lukas Podolski and Max Kruse, both of whom failed to get on the scoresheet against Gibraltar. Karim Bellarabi has become a regular starter for Germany since the World Cup . Out-of-sorts forward Lukas Podolski wasn't able to get on the scoresheet against minnows Gibraltar . THE FUTURE . SPAIN . Going into the next big tournament with David De Gea or Iker Casillas in goal; Real Madrid’s Dani Carvajal and Barcelona’s Jordi Alba at full-backs; and Gerard Pique alongside Sergio Ramos in the centre of defence should give the Spanish a solid base on which to build. Sergi Busquets and Koke look set to become the new midfield pairing with Diego Costa leading the line in attack. And in the line of three behind the striker Del Bosque still has enough players for two teams with with Isco, Paco Alcacer, Pedro, Andres Iniesta, David Silva and Cesc Fabregas all available to him. It’s still a squad to envy and if the right balance can be found between the old and the new France 2016 could yet belong to the Spanish.

Some changes for the match in Vigo have been forced, with Manuel Neuer, Jerome Boateng and Marco Reus all out. However, Low has been far from satisfied with some of the contributions of his fringe players and demanded they step it up in a blast after the Gibraltar match. The whole team still seems to be struggling with the return to the mundane day job after their World Cup glory and Low needs to inspire them again.

"Any Spanish players upset by a perceived lack of commitment from Diego Costa and Cesc Fabregas will get another chance to win without them on Tuesday night against an understrength Germany side in Vigo. Coach Vicente del Bosque told Spanish radio station Onda Cero: ‘It could be that when Costa and Fabregas come back another player has taken their place. That is not a threat, it’s just reality.’ Del Bosque’s comments were a reference to the storm that blew up ahead of Spain’s 3-0 Euro 2016 qualifying win over Belarus on Saturday when Sergio Ramos said: ‘I just wish players had the same level of commitment to the national team as they do with their clubs.’ Cesc Fabregas missed Spain's victory over Belarus on Saturday through injury .

He said players who did not want to run should not play and claimed Wales would crush his side if they were to repeat that performance during their Euro 2016 qualifier. As it was the match on Wednesday night ended 0-0 and Courtois, 22, said his words of warning were justified.

"Spain may well have found the leader of their brave new world in Huelva on Saturday night as they beat Belarus 3-0. Real Madrid midfielder Isco scored the first with a glorious shot from the edge of the area and ran the game for the European Champions before being given a standing ovation as he went off on 80 minutes. All the controversy in the build-up to the match over Sergio Ramos’ comments that he wished his team-mates ‘had the same commitment for their clubs as for their country’ was forgotten as Isco put on a show. Ramos' comments were interpreted as criticism of Cesc Fabregas and more particularly Diego Costa who had pulled out of this qualifier despite playing against Liverpool last weekend. The defender later said he had not been referring to any players in particular but Costa’s absence had not gone down well with several senior Spanish players. VIDEO Scroll down to see another of Isco's wonderful training goals . Spain's Isco (left) celebrates with Jordi Alba (right) and Koke after putting his side ahead against Belarus in Huelva .

Without the Chelsea pair however, and with only one Premier League player - a rare sight across the last seven years in which they have won three major tournaments - Spain made light work of beating Belarus. It was that sole Premier League representative, Arsenal’s Santi Cazorla, who crossed for Spain’s first chance of the game but Barcelona’s Pedro managed to put the effort wide on five minutes. On 18 minutes Isco showed his team-mates how to finish as Spain went ahead with a moment’s magic. He has been likened to Zinedine Zidane at Real Madrid where supporters are desperate to see the Malaga born midfielder succeed even if it means he sometimes plays instead of Gareth Bale. The Frenchman would have been proud of this first-half strike with Isco finding the top corner from just outside the area leaving visiting keeper Yuri Zhekov rooted to the spot. Within three minutes Spain had doubled their lead when Sergio Busquets scored from even further out, catching a defensive clearance perfectly and leaving Zhekov helpless again. At the other end Iker Casillas was having a quiet night back in the team for the injured David de Gea, who dislocated a finger in training in midweek, leaving the way clear for the captain to return to the side. Paco Alcacer, playing at centre-forward in place of Costa, headed Pedro’s cross just wide at the start of the second-half as Spain kept up their domination. And 10 minutes into the second period it was Pedro who scored his 16th goal for La Roja, sweeping in Juanfran’s cross from the right. Isco was ably aided in midfield by Atletico Madrid’s Koke and by a lively Cazorla who was given a standing ovation on 68 minutes when he finally made way for Napoli forward Jose Callejon. Cazorla played in Huelva for Recreativo before he moved to Villarreal, Malaga and then Arsenal.

The match, which will be played at Celta Vigo's stadium in north-west Spain, will see the current world champions taking on their predecessors. Neither, though, are in particularly good form.

While Spain's group-stage exit necessitated the reshuffle of a previously unbeatable formula, Germany's success led to the retirement of a number of influential players, including captain Philipp Lahm and Arsenal's Per Mertesacker. Meanwhile, Del Bosque even revealed he would be prepared to drop Chelsea duo Diego Costa and Cesc Fabregas as he continues to look for the right balance. He said: 'As I have said, when a player who comes to us plays well, others that want to get into the team will find it more difficult. 'If I say that Diego Costa and Cesc may find it hard to play I'm not threatening any sort of revenge or reprisal against anybody, it merely reflects a truth about football that we all know.

"Sergio Ramos has tried to diffuse a brewing club vs country battle between Chelsea and Spain by insisting he was not referring to Diego Costa and Cesc Fabregas when he questioned certain players' commitment to La Roja. Speaking to Radio Marcos on Wednesday, Ramos said: 'It depends on the player's make-up but I would have cleared up the matter so there were no repercussions and no room for any doubts. ‘Often with injuries there can be a world of difference between what we have and what is said in public.

Laying out rules is difficult. But above all I would have liked the players to show the same commitment to the national team as they do to their club. ‘You must show this commitment and spirit to all the new players. There are times I have played despite having some niggles. It all depends on the DNA of the player. ‘I wish players had same the level of commitment with the national team as with their clubs.' Ramos' comments were interpreted as a direct response to Diego Costa pulling out of the Spain squad before playing, and scoring, against Liverpool, and Fabregas returning to London after arriving in Madrid with a hamstring complaint. Jose Mourinho pictured at the O2 Arena for Andy Murray's defeat against Roger Federer on Thursday night . But Ramos has done his best to calm the waters saying: 'When I spoke about commitment I did not want to say that those two did not have it. The row between Chelsea and Spain has been simmering all season with Vicente del Bosque ignoring Jose Mourinho's desire for Costa not to play two games in a week during the last international break. The striker returned with a hamstring injury and missed the next two games with his club. Adding fuel to the flames is the shared history of Mourinho, Ramos and Spain captain Iker Casillas. Mourinho fell out with the goalkeeper when he was his manager at Real Madrid because Casillas felt that Mourinho's cranking up of tension between Barcelona and Real Madrid was affecting the national side.

"Sometimes, coming on as a late substitute in an international football match can be difficult. And that proved the case for England midfielder Ross Barkley, who got a telling off from Roy Hodgson just seconds after entering the field of play. 'Keep it tight' will have been the message from the England manager, as Barkley came on to tighten the midfield in the latter stages of the match. With the score at 3-1, Barkley received the ball but was unable to keep hold of it, losing possession in Scotland's favour.

"Seven years after Three Lions first decorated his white shirt, a young man from Surrey was entrusted with the task of briefly upsetting some of his kith and kin. Yet, when Chris Martin returns to Derby County on Wednesday morning, a fifth Scotland cap in his possession, he will surely do so with a heavy heart and consumed with feelings of deep regret. One of the more recent conscripts to Gordon Strachan’s squad, the 26-year-old was granted his first start in Dark Blue in Steven Fletcher’s injury-enforced absence. Scotland striker Chris Martin, pictured against Chris Smalling, failed to make an impression against England . Frankly, though, over the course of 45 minutes, the former England Under-19 player did little to suggest the Scotland manager would be able hang his hat on him in the future should the need arise. Truthfully, it was a chastening night for almost every member of the home side. It proved to be a crushing low after the elation of victory over Ireland on Friday, with the only crumb of consolation that it didn’t come in a competitive match. Martin was by no means the only player to fall way short of the standard required at this level but as the only change in the home side’s starting line-up over the two games, his shortcomings were all the more glaring. He lasted only until half-time before being replaced by Darren Fletcher – with Steven Naismith pushed forward - and his withdrawal was about as inevitable as day following night. Whether he is afforded another such gilt-edged opportunity is a matter of some conjecture. Martin expertly brings the ball down but only lasted until half-time before being replaced by Darren Fletcher . In mitigation, a chronic lack of service undoubtedly contributed to an underwhelming display but it was still distinctly cumbersome and uncertain. As England dominated the early exchanges, that settling first touch every striker craves proved elusive. When it finally came, the breath of Chris Smalling was on Martin’s neck and the ball was smuggled to safety by the men in white. It set a depressing tone for the striker. Those entrusted with the No 9 shirt in Strachan’s favoured 4-2-3-1 system, can find the position both a blessing and a curse. Martin puts his hands on his hips and waits to restart the game with Steven Naismith after England's opener . When the wind is in the sails, the opportunities created by the three supporting players seem boundless. When defensive diligence is called for – as was often the case last night – it must feel like the loneliest of roles. Even accounting for that, Martin generally struggled to hold the ball up and drag others into play. For a big lump of a man, his direct opponents were untroubled. To coin the old phrase, he seemed to leave much out there. Brief moments of promise were invariably followed by a clumsy touch. When Ikechi Anya or Shaun Maloney stole a yard on the flank, the Derby man always appeared yards shy of connecting with a cross. When he attempted a reverse ball or a cross-field pass, his appreciation of the wider game was not what it should have been. The harder he tried, the less things came off for him. Steven Fletcher may have failed to hit the net in what has been an interrupted five-and-a-half years at international level but Martin’s movement looked measurably inferior to the man for whom he deputised last night. At times, he couldn’t do right for doing wrong. One moment in particular summed up his contribution. Having dropped inside his own half to instigate an attack, he showed a deft first-touch and held Gary Cahill off. Yet, the subsequent pass to Andrew Robertson was a yard behind the full-back and the ball trundled straight out of play. Martin keeps his eyes on the ball and manages to hold off the challenge of England defender Gary Cahill . Strachan, as we well know, just doesn’t do hands-on-hips bystanders. It’s one thing holding the position to create an out-ball but defending set-pieces was as much a part of Martin’s detail as ruffling the feathers of Smalling and Gary Cahill. He did what he could in that regard, but in the real things that mattered – ball retention, playing others in, being an aerial threat – he rated poorly. And yet for all that, Strachan appears to be very much in his fan club. A yardstick of Martin’s standing in manager’s eyes isn’t so much the fact he’s now first deputy to Fletcher but the calibre of player he is presently keeping out of the squad. Fellow Championship strikers Jordan Rhodes and Ross McCormack come with £8million and £11m price tags, respectively, on their shirts these days, yet the man who joined Derby County under freedom of contract a year ago has elbowed them both out of the way. It will be interesting to see if he remains the blue-eyed boy for much longer. On this evidence, the aforementioned pair must wonder when – or indeed if – the door to international football will open again. Certainly, both Johnny Russell and Stevie May, who were both given late run-outs here, have little to fear in terms of the competition nipping at their heels .","Chris Martin failed to make an impression for Scotland on Tuesday .

"QPR boss Harry Redknapp has launched an attack on directors of football, insisting that he could never work alongside one at Loftus Road. The former Tottenham boss ripped into the system used by Spurs, who sit 12th in the Premier League following a huge but generally unsuccessful recruitment drive in the summer of 2013. Under the guidance of technical director Franco Baldini, the north London outfit spent the money earned from Gareth Bale's world record move to Real Madrid on seven players at a cost of £107million. QPR manager Harry Redknapp has criticised the role of director of football, claiming the job is 'nonsense' Tottenham striker Roberto Soldado has struggled since being bought by Franco Baldini in the summer of 2013 . Redknapp takes pride in signing his own players, such as striker Charlie Austin (right), at QPR . Andre Villas-Boas was sacked by chairman Daniel Levy just a few months later, with summer acquisitions including Paulinho, Roberto Soldado and Erik Lamela failing to live up to their hefty price-tags. Redknapp, who has complete control of purchases at QPR, cannot see the sense in managers being forced to work with players that they have not chosen themselves. In an interview with the Evening Standard, Redknapp said: 'It totally undermines your role as manager if you're not picking the players. It's a joke really that you are expected to work with someone else's players. It's all very well someone recommending players to you but when they don't work out, it's your head on the block.' The 67-year-old made his feelings about working under a director of football clear to Tottenham when he moved to White Hart Lane in 2008, resulting in Damien Comolli being sacked. Baldini, pictured watching Spurs face Manchester City, makes decisions on player signings at White Hart Lane . QPR sit 19th in the Premier League after an enthralling 2-2 draw with Manchester City last time out . Ex-Spurs boss Redknapp doesn't think managers should be accountable for players they haven't signed . And Redknapp insists that it is not fair that managers are judged - and possibly sacked - because of decisions not made by them. He added: 'I'm just not in favour of that. As a manager I have to select the players, train them every day and make decisions. To expect me to work with players someone else has decided I want is a nonsense. I want to make my own decisions and rightfully so. If things don't work out fine, I'm responsible for that. But why should I be accountable for someone else's mistakes? 'My head's on the block when it goes wrong so no I'm not going to support something that could cost me my job and I have no say in it.'","QPR boss Harry Redknapp would not work with a director of football .

"Ron-Robert Zieler enhanced his reputation as one of Europe's top young goalkeepers with a clean sheet on Tuesday night as Germany defeated Spain. Zieler, standing in for the injured Manuel Neuer, joined the likes of Toni Kroos and Thomas Muller in a star-studded line-up for the world champions. But his professional career had a far more humble beginning. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Ron-Robert Zieler's best saves for Hannover . Zieler celebrates Germany's victory over Spain alongside Real Madrid superstar Toni Kroos (No 18) In February 2009, Zieler made his senior debut at Northampton Town's Sixfields, of all places, in a team in which now-AFC Wimbledon striker Adebayo Akinfenwa was the star man. Zieler, now 25, could not keep out Walsall that day as he did the European champions in Vigo. Northampton lost 2-0 in front of a crowd of 4,528, with former Arsenal midfielder Stephen Hughes and now-Oldham striker Jabo Ibehre getting the better of the man on loan from Manchester United. Spain started with Juventus striker Alvaro Morata up front on Tuesday night, but five and a half years ago it was a strikeforce of an ageing Michael Ricketts and now-Watford captain Troy Deeney that proved too much for Northampton and Zieler. Zieler challenges Walsall's Manny Smith - now at Wrexham - on his debut for Northampton in February 2009 . The Germany goalkeeper prepares to clear the ball at Sixfields as the Cobblers slipped to a 2-0 defeat . That was one of only two senior appearances Zieler would make in a frustrating five-year spell in England, with the second coming just three days later in a 1-1 draw at Brighton and Hove Albion as now-Bournemouth captain Tommy Elphick headed past him for the home side's equaliser. Zieler moved to United as a 16-year-old from Cologne in July 2005 with a burgeoning reputation following some star performances for Germany's youth teams. He left five years later with that reputation seemingly in tatters, having spent most of his last season at Old Trafford warming the bench for United's reserve side. Zieler signs for Man United alongside Sir Alex Ferguson in 2005. He did not make an appearance for the club . Zieler was tipped for big things when he joined United as a 16-year-old from Cologne . Four years on though and Zieler now has a World Cup winners' medal - although he did not play in Brazil he was in Joachim Low's squad, as he was for Euro 2012 - and four caps for his country. Zieler joined Hannover on a free transfer in the summer of 2010, made his first-team debut in January 2011 and has not missed a Bundesliga game since, racking up 128 consecutive appearances and establishing himself as one of the best goalkeepers in Germany, if not Europe. The 6ft 1in stopper has been heavily linked with a move to Borussia Dortmund to replace their ageing No 1 Roman Weidenfeller, who Zieler has now usurped as Neuer's deputy. The goalkeeper celebrates Germany's World Cup triumph in Berlin back in July . Zieler barks orders at his defence as he keeps a clean sheet against Spain in Vigo on Tuesday night . At 28, Neuer - undisputedly world's best goalkeeper - has plenty of years left in him but Zieler too looks set to be a part of the German set-up for a long time to come. It is remarkable to think not only that he could not get a look-in at United, but that he played just twice for Stuart Gray's Northampton in a three-month loan spell with the League One club. Northampton would be relegated at the end of the 2008-09 season and the man who kept Zieler out of the side, Chris Dunn, is now plying his trade with Cambridge United in League Two. Cambridge are 10th in the bottom tier while Northampton are 17th. It looks like Zieler has had the last laugh.

"Mesut Ozil has complete trust Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger can help make him a better player. The Gunners' record signing is currently recovering from a knee injury suffered at the start of October, and is not expected to feature again until early 2015. Ozil has been criticised for perceived inconsistent displays, with questions raised over whether the former Real Madrid playmaker can cope under the physical demands of the Barclays Premier League. Mesut Ozil has been regularly criticised for his performances since joining Arsenal from Real Madrid . Wenger, however, retains complete faith in the £42.5million midfielder, who is in no doubt he is at the right club and under the right manager to move his game forwards. Speaking to Esquire magazine, Ozil said: 'He (Wenger) knows what he wants and I know he can bring me a step forward; he trusts me in that way and I trust him, completely. 'For a team, it (a trophy) is the biggest thing to get and we got it (last season with the FA Cup), but as a player, there are other things - being the best player in the world, other cups, the Champions League. The German World Cup winner is currently out with a knee injury and isn't expected back until January . 'For now, I am not making any plans for after my career. I am just really happy to be here.' Ozil will not let the constant debate over his consistency cloud his focus. The 26-year-old added: 'I have been in this business so long now, I have been a professional since I was 16, 17. 'I don't care what the press thinks about me as football changes from day to day. 'You can play well one day and badly the next. I'm used to it.' Arsenal will resume their Premier League campaign on Saturday at home to Manchester United. Ozil revealed he has complete faith in manager Arsene Wenger's ability to get the best out of him . The Gunners are down in sixth place and in need of a response having lost 2-1 at Swansea before the international break, which followed on from the draw against Anderlecht in the Champions League when they threw away a 3-0 advantage. England manager Roy Hodgson has allayed fears over the fitness of Danny Welbeck. The Arsenal forward, signed on deadline day from United, was substituted during the second half of the friendly against Scotland in Glasgow, but only as a precaution after a 'slight stiffness' in his hamstring.","Arsenal midfielder Mesut Ozil is out with a knee injury until 2015 .

"Tottenham's season continues to stumble from one disaster to the next, with the finger of blame pointed towards many sections within the club. The board, the manager, players, fans and even the pitch have come under fire this term but who is really to blame for the decline at White Hart Lane? Sportsmail looks at the key figures involved at the club and the part they have played in Spurs' rapidly dwindling fortunes. Erik Lamela and Harry Kane (right) react during Tottenham's calamitous 2-1 Premier League loss by Stoke at White Hart Lane on Sunday - their fourth home defeat of the campaign . Joe Lewis . Tottenham's owner may be a billionaire but he hasn't exactly dipped deep into his pockets to help the club elevate from the also-rans into Premier League title contenders. That may seem a crazy statement considering Spurs have had summer transfer windows reaching over £100m in expenditure, and they have consistently over the last five years been one of the biggest spenders in the top flight. Joe Lewis hold Daniel Levy's arm as he watches on during Tottenham's 3-0 defeat by Liverpool at White Hart Lane earlier this season in the Premier League . But they have also raised plenty of funds through player sales, and as a result are bottom of the table of Premier League net spenders over the last five years in comparison with every other top flight club. Lewis was also on board with the decision to part company with Harry Redknapp over two years ago. Blame rating 3/5 . Daniel Levy . An increasing number of fans are losing patience with Levy, who has come under criticism for a range of issues including manager choices, stadium development and club's managerial set-up. The Spurs chairman has successfully overseen a project to build one of the most impressive training grounds in Europe at Hotspur Way, but his track record elsewhere is questionable. Levy has come under fire regarding the handling of a new stadium and his managerial appointments . George Graham (1998-2001) Glenn Hoddle (2001-2003) David Pleat (2003-2004) Jacques Santini (2004) Martin Jol (2004-2007) Juande Ramos (2007-2008) Harry Redknapp (2008-2012) Andre Villas-Boas (2012-2013) Tim Sherwood (2013-2014) Mauricio Pochettino (2014- present) Having gone through 10 managers since taking over in 2001, no consistency is ever put down at the club and during that time Levy has favoured a continental approach of using a head coach and a director of football. It's a system that's never worked. Harry Redknapp's tenure that took Spurs to Champions League football was a desperate breakaway from the format, with the current QPR boss having been originally brought in to clear up the mess left behind by Juande Ramos and Damien Comolli in 2008. A lack of discussion with fans over a controversial move to Stratford's Olympic Stadium (which failed) and constant delays over the build of the new stadium has made the club look amateurish in planning its future home - especially regarding the temporary move to Milton Keynes. Meanwhile long suffering fans are paying the second highest ticket prices in the league, with a partnership with ticketing site Stubhub also alienating sections of supporters. With the club in regression, many see Levy is a constant presence in every false dawn making him accountable to many fans over Tottenham's current plight. Blame rating 5/5 . Franco Baldini . Recruited as director of football in 2013 to 'assist' Andre Villas-Boas with transfers after Redknapp's managerial replacement had guided the club to their biggest ever Premier League points haul the season before. His challenge was to reinvest the money collected from Gareth Bale's record £86million transfer to Real Madrid and bring in a raft of replacements to make Spurs an overall stronger squad. Seven high profile signings and a little over a year later, all Spurs have to show for the £100m-plus spend-up is a fairly positive season from Christian Eriksen (who has faded badly this term), and a rather decent rabona goal from Erik Lamela (who has done little else as the club's £30million record signing.) Before joining Tottenham, Franco Baldini (left) was an assistant to Fabio Capello in the England set-up . From left to right, Paulinho, Christian Eriksen, Roberto Soldado, Nacer Chadli, Etienne Capoue, Vlad Chiriches and Erik Lamela were the seven players signed to replace Gareth Bale - but none have consistently starred . Roberto Soldado at £26m has proven to be one of the Premier League's worst ever striker signings, while Paulinho and Vlad Chiriches at over £25million combined are fortunate to even reach a matchday squad such is their poor contribution. Etienne Capoue has made little impact while utility addition Nacer Chadli is slowly starting to become the team's key player. This year's summer signings included Federico Fazio, Benji Stambouli and Ben Davies, with the latter two struggling to get on the pitch while the former can barely stay on it having already picked up two red cards. You had one job, Franco... Blame rating 4/5 . Mauricio Pochettino . Arrived in the Premier League as an unknown manager on these shores at Southampton at the start of 2013 and in18 months forged a reputation as one of the brightest bosses in the top flight. Yet since taking over at Tottenham, that reputation is starting to take a hammering on a weekly basis. So what's gone wrong? The players appear to be struggling with Pochettino's pressing tactic and the Argentine is either too stubborn to change it or lacking a Plan B for his confidence-shot team. Mauricio Pochettino looks on during Tottenham's League Cup fourth round win over Brighton earlier this season, the cup competitions have been the Spurs boss's highlights in a slow start at White Hart Lane . The constant changing of starting line-ups suggest he still doesn't know his best XI and if he did have a say in summer transfers, he appears to already have lost faith in all three of his signings who have hardly featured. With a team very similar to last season's, Pochettino's side are already six points off Villas-Boas' Spurs outfit. More worryingly will be the level of performances. Tottenham have already been rolled over with ease by Stoke, Newcastle and West Brom, while relative big guns Liverpool and Manchester City have already stuck seven goals past Spurs this term. The Argentine deserves more time to lay his blueprint on the squad however - especially with the team progressing well in Europe and the League Cup. Blame rating 3/5 . The players . Every team loses, it's an inevitable of football. So when it does happen, fans can point blame towards tight refereeing calls, ways the team can learn from mistakes or just flat out settle that luck went against them. But on many occasions this season, Tottenham fans have been left with none of the above three to call upon. Tottenham have lost games showing very little (if any) danger in attack while throwing up a circus of a back four on many occasions. Even the league wins are unconvincing, with the 4-0 home win over QPR the only time Spurs have looked relatively comfortable playing in the top flight all season (draws at Sunderland and Arsenal aside). Kane and Nacer Chadli share a discussion on the pitch during the 2-1 loss by Stoke at White Hart Lane . Emmanuel Adebayor infuriated fans after being unprepared to come on as a substitute against Stoke on Sunday after being forced to change his footwear . Considering the money spent on much of the first-team, it's a rather poor return from the current squad. But with a team containing fingerprints from six previous Spurs managers, it's little wonder that the current crop have failed to settle into a cohesive unit. Another pressing issue is the departure of long term stalwarts and characters in recent years such as Ledley King and Michael Dawson, leaving Spurs with very few leaders on the pitch. Blame rating 3/5 . The fans . Emmanuel Adebayor may have whipped up a frenzy in speaking about the negative atmosphere inside White Hart Lane provided by the home support, but he isn't the first to point the finger of blame at the Spurs fans. Andre Villas-Boas made a similar remark in the last few months of his reign of how he felt the fans were hindering rather than supporting his players with booing at matches. It's a touchy subject, with supporters arguing that having paid for a ticket they have a right to voice their displeasure and that it's up to the players to give them something to cheer about. Tottenham fans have been criticised by Adebayor and Andre Villas-Boas before over their negative impact at White Hart Lane having often turned on their team with a chorus of boos when the home side are struggling . It makes the opposition's team-talk a lot easier though when you know a fast start at White Hart Lane will quickly lead to home fans getting on their side's backs. Adebayor and AVB seem to make valid points though, with booing hardly a strong motivational tool to help get behind a struggling team. But to blame a section of supporters for a team's plight is quite drastic. Tottenham's home fans need to show more patience and support for the benefit of their side but neither are they the cause of the problem. Blame rating 1/5 . Previous managers . A rot started under Harry Redknapp when his team went on a disastrous run at the end of the 2011-12 campaign to throw away a Champions League place, but the bounce back the following season under Andre Villas-Boas makes Redknapp unaccountable for current events. Blame rating 0/5 . Replacing Redknapp, was Andre Villas-Boas and while Spurs recorded their most ever points in a Premier League season under AVB - many point towards Gareth Bale as the key reason behind their challenge for a Champions League place in 2012/13. Harry Redknapp, Andre Villas-Boas and Tim Sherwood have had managerail spells since 2012 at Tottenham . After Bale's departure, Spurs struggled to score and started suffering humiliating defeats by Manchester City (6-0) and Liverpool (5-0) leading to the Portuguese' in December last year. The team's now fragile mentality hasn't recovered. Blame rating 2/5 . Tim Sherwood was brought in to replace Villas-Boas shortly before Christmas last year, but while Spurs often beat teams below them in the table, they were often heavily defeated by the division's best outfits. Sherwood promoted youngsters like Harry Kane and Nabil Bentaleb into the line-up but his honest attitude failed to install a team ethic in the squad and he was dismissed as manager in the summer. Blame rating 1/5 . White Hart Lane's 'small pitch' Not even the turf at White Hart Lane is avoiding the finger of blame, with Pochettino describing Tottenham's pitch as too small for the way his side like to play. Pochettino has  described White Hart Lane's pitch as being too small for his team's style of play . It's proving easy enough for the opposition to play on though while the same pitch has previously brought success for Redknapp's free-flowing Spurs.

"It is supposed to be as blockbuster as they come. Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi - with all of their individual records, global fame and last six Ballon d'Ors between them - do battle in Britain's most iconic venues. The trouble is, Old Trafford didn't feel as if it was the preface scene to one of the great modern day rivalries in world football. Those in front of the cameras on Monday trotted out the party lines that yes, it was their man who deserved to clinch this year's Ballon d'Or, and no, their opinions weren't for changing. Cristiano Ronaldo and his team-mates showed off their skills during a brief training session on Monday night . Ronaldo has won two Ballon D'ors, while Lionel Messi has been given the award on four occassions . On Tuesday the home of Manchester United holds a fixture which ought to capture the imagination but feels as if - for the two respective camps, anyway - that the playground debate as to who's more complete is undermining what is a showpiece in its own right. There have been various projections as to how many will flock to the North West, but the club are hopeful of as many as 50,000. They had sold around 30,000 at the close of play on Monday with tickets available on the gate. If those close to the story are bored to tears of talking, there remains a healthy appetite from the paying public to watch them pit their wits against each other internationally. Even if they represent an unwanted distraction to two teams who need performances, it is an evening you will not be able to take away from the thousands of schoolchildren who want to catch a glimpse of their heroes. Some waited patiently outside the Stretford End before Ronaldo trained in a bobble hat. Any chance they can get for a quick peak. The World Player of the Year has a kick about on the famous ground where he made his name . Argentina captain Messi will hope to show on Tuesday night that he is still on a level with Ronaldo . The 29-year-old is back for the first time since knocking United out of the Champions League in 2013 and this brings the relative merits of both superstars into sharp focus. Not wholly unsurprising then that when met with the words Ronaldo and Messi, Richardo Carvalho bore a look of acceptance with a wry smile. Gerardo Martino asserts the latter should claw back the game's glitziest individual prize. Portugal's Fernando Santos disagrees, with both managers voting for their men with all the predictability of a politician at his local polling station come election Thursday. 'They are both genius,' Santos said. It was the closest we came to any sort of hyperbole. Whether towing the party line or not, those within the Portuguese camp are vehement in proclaiming their galactico will get his hands on the golden trophy again in January. For Ronaldo, that'll mean two on the spin and a third overall. Ronaldo's record this season is exceptional, and he will want to continue his scoring on his former ground . Carvalho, now 36 and back in the international fold after missing out on the World Cup after being put out to pasture by ex-manager Paulo Bento, said: 'I think Ronaldo is the best [in the world]. 'It is normal to speak about Cristiano and Messi but it is Argentina versus Portugal. For us Portuguese, everyone is expecting that Cristiano can win the third Golden Ball.' There is no reason to suggest Carvalho is anything but spot on. Ronaldo broke the record for number of goals scored in a single Champions League season and dragged Carlo Ancelotti's Real to that title kicking and screaming. He has recently been recognised as the best in La Liga and - Carvalho believes - is 'almost perfect', whereas the decision to hand Messi the Player of the Tournament award in Brazil was one to raise more than a few eyebrows. Former Chelsea and Real Madrid defender Carvalho backed his international team-mate to retain the award . Cristiano Ronaldo was in fine form again this weekend, scoring the only goal in a win over Armenia . 'Cristiano always wants more, even in training,' Carvalho added. 'Maybe next he can break his own records.' While the former Chelsea defender offered some flesh on the bones, Martino was at his most pragmatic. 'I cannot separate sentiment from my objective decision,' he said, somewhat rehearsed. 'Whatever season Messi had on footballing grounds, I would still vote for him.' They want to get in and out with minimal fuss. If it's anything like Messi's trip to Upton Park last week, marked with the constant flash of cameras, they won't be allowed to slip away unnoticed.","Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi meet in friendly at Old Trafford .

"Barcelona star Neymar and the rest of the Brazil squad have completed their final training session ahead of their clash with Austria. Dunga's side were put through their paces at the Ernst Happel Stadium in Vienna, where they will take on the European side on Tuesday night in a friendly.

A humiliating 7-1 defeat at the hands of eventual winners Germany was followed by 3-0 loss to Louis van Gaal's Holland in the third-place play-off. But following former manager and captain Dunga's appointment as boss, Brazil have enjoyed a revival, winning all five of their games without conceding a goal. The victories included morale-boosting results against continental rivals Argentina and Colombia. Dunga will be hoping that trend continues on Tuesday against the Austrians, who themselves have not lost a game for over a year and are top of their Euro 2016 qualifying group.

Reports in Brazil suggested that thiago Silva was unhappy that the captaincy had been taken away from him . The only player who hasn't been happy with the recent circumstances surrounding the team is former captain Thiago Silva. The PSG defender told Brazilian media he was extremely unhappy that nobody had consulted him before Neymar was made captain of the side. Dunga, though, was predictably firm in his response to the central defender. 'I respect the history of each individual in the Brazil team but this is my way of working,' Dunga told reporters. 'Nobody loses out on anything when they are with the Brazilian team,' said the prickly coach. 'The Brazil team is the Brazil team, every day here has to be conquered; every single second, every single training session. 'We believe in hierarchy and in rules, so that everyone in the group gets on with everyone else,' he added. 'We believe in organising our work, we don't like improvisation.'

"Bill Kenwright has opened the door for Wayne Rooney to make a sensational return to Everton in the coming years. The Toffees chairman was bullish in his assessment that the England captain will wear the blue shirt again by saying: ‘He comes back to Goodison’. Rooney spent his early career dazzling on Merseyside and – even before playing a game for the first team in 2002 – claimed that ‘once a blue always a blue’. Bill Kenwright has opened the door for Wayne Rooney to make a sensational return to Everton . Rooney (celebrating scoring against Aston Villa in 2003) was held up as a local hero on Merseyside . The youngster took the Premier League by storm before a move to Manchester United in 2004 . While Everton supporters struggled to forgive the striker after a £26million move to Manchester United, Kenwright sees no problems if he wanted to see out his career back where it all started. The exit to Sir Alex Ferguson’s United in 2004 was acrimonious, although the depth of ill-feeling has subsided significantly. ‘He comes back to Goodison. He's an Evertonian and his family are. He is welcome to come back,’ he told BBC Radio 5Live. Rooney is one of English football's most decorated forwards after a decade playing at Old Trafford .

Kenwright (pictured with Everton manager Roberto Martinez) thinks a return could be on the cards . Rooney - who surpassed a century of caps for his country at the weekend - is tied down to another five years at Old Trafford. Crucially for Everton supporters, the 69-year-old didn’t bring up the issue of money. His wages are astronomical in relation to what Everton pay their players, but Kenwright sees no reason why they can’t lure the 29-year-old back before he retires. ‘In all honesty, all I ever do is advise,’ he added. ‘I am not sidestepping the question. It is always going to be Roberto Martinez's choice.’ VIDEO Rooney expecting fiery atmosphere in Scotland .","Everton chairman Bill Kenwright wants Wayne Rooney to return .

"Jimmy Bullard has sent a warning shot to his fellow I'm a Celebrity contestants, insisting if anyone 'p****s' him off in the jungle the former footballer will have no hesitation retaliating. The 36-year-old was announced as a surprise inclusion in the ITV reality show earlier this week and touched down in Australia on Monday. And former Wigan and Fulham midfielder Bullard was pulling no punches when he was interviewed by ITV ahead of the programme's launch on Sunday. Jimmy Bullard was announced as a surprise contestant in this year's I'm a Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here . Bullard touched down in Australia on Monday ahead of his appearance on the ITV reality show . Bullard was flooded as soon as he arrived in Australia at the beginning of this week .

"Jimmy Bullard's larger than life character made him a popular hit among football fans up and down the country during his playing career. Since retiring the 36-year-old has released a book titled Bend it like Bullard, as the former Fulham midfielder tries to expand his horizons beyond football. On Monday it was announced that Bullard will be entering this year's version of reality TV show I'm a Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here! where his sense of humour is bound to prove a hit in the Australian jungle. Ahead of his trip down under, Sportsmail reviews Bullard's top 10 most memorable quotes. Former Wigan, Fulham and Hull midfielder Jimmy Bullard will be on I'm a Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here! ‘Jimmy White was my massive idol. I never met him until six weeks ago, when I found out he was at my local golf club and dashed up there. I didn’t really know how to approach him, it’s difficult. “Hello Jimmy, I’ve got hundreds of old VHS tapes of you back home. Bit perverted, I know, but that’s what I think of you”.’ ‘The bloke was immaculate. His kit was tight and fitted him perfectly. Paolo di Canio became West Ham club captain and his skipper’s armband had claret and blue tassles hanging off it, making him look like a warrior. 'Socks rolled up perfectly over his permanently shaved, well-oiled legs, he oozed Italian class and style. He was a real man. And he was also an utterly terrifying nutcase.’ Bullard said his idol growing up was Jimmy White and he feared Paolo di Canio during his time at West Ham . ‘[David] Bentley was also my partner in crime when it came to taking the p*** out of Mr Capello. I remember looking at the gaffer on my first day and thinking, ‘I can’t believe how much he looks like Postman Pat; it’s him!’ Bentley obviously loved it - ‘Wa-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!’ - and when we were on the team coach, we sat at the back and started singing the Postman Pat theme tune. A few of the boys joined in - I think Rio, Ashley Cole and Jermaine Jenas might have had a quiet little sing-along -but most of the other dry lunches weren’t really up for it.’ David Bentey (centre) used to be Bullard's partner in crime when joking about ex-England boss Fabio Capello . ‘My first training session with England…A bus took us to Arsenal’s training ground at London Colney. As it parked, Wayne Rooney was itching to get off. The door opened and he flew out of it like a dog let off its leash. He legged it straight to one of the goals, picked a few balls out of the net and started shelling them at the crossbar, hitting it every time. ‘Wayne!’ screamed Fabio Capello. ‘You’ll pull a muscle!’ ‘Behave Fab, I’ve not pulled a muscle since I was 13,’ said Rooney. The pace of the training was at least twice as quick as I was used to at Fulham. We started with a five-vs-five keep-ball session in an area that seemed not much bigger than a tablecloth. The ball was still pinging about like a pinball as pass after pass was completed. After a drill like that, I couldn’t believe England get slagged off by pundits for not being able to pass the ball. Maybe our problem is we need to play internationals on pitches the size of tablecloths.’ Bullard (left) says he was impressed by England's level of ability during training sessions . ‘I never felt Fabio gave the boys a lot of direction. For starters, his English was poor and it was very difficult to understand what he was going on about most of the time. The only thing he said that stuck was: “Let’s all attack together, let’s all defend together.” Not terrible advice, but when I remembered that this was international football, the pinnacle of the game, I thought it was just a little bit basic. To be frank, I’d had better coaching when I was playing non-League.’ Bullard was critical of Capello's grasp of the English language during their time together . ‘The manager [Fabio Capello] didn’t make it easy, to be fair. We spent two weeks away with England and he said two sentences to me. He was terrible. It was really bad. I struggled with it. ‘You can’t have a laugh, you can’t have a drink; you eat when you’re told to. What’s all that about? Why can’t you eat when you’re hungry? I can’t stand it all. I’ve never understood it, but it’s professional and it’s the done thing. It’s boring.’ Bullard (left) also revealed that he wasn't a fan of  Capello strict management during his England reign . ‘I came in one Monday morning at Fulham after we’d lost 3-0 and I was stretching and laughing with Danny Murphy, Paul Konchesky and a couple of others. Roy Hodgson’s come in and gone, “Stop laughing, we lost on Saturday”. Then his next team talk on Thursday is, “C’mon, let’s look forward to the next game”. Well, I can’t really, Roy, because you’ve just murdered me on Monday for laughing. A lot of managers do that. They say something and don’t really mean it. On Thursday it’s all right to have a laugh, is it? Monday too fresh? So, when’s the rule come in? When can I laugh? Tuesday night? Let me know. Breakfast time Wednesday? Is it longer depending on the score? I don’t understand it.’ Bullard (right) and Danny Murphy were once told off by then-Fulham boss Roy Hodgson for laughing . ‘I took fitness as a given and thought it wasn’t a skill, but it is. Fitness is a key. If we went on a long run, Nathan Ellington would run like he had a caravan on his back, but you wouldn’t beat him in a sprint. It’s mental. Razor (Neil Ruddock) was the unfittest player I ever saw and the most outrageous person I ever met. ‘Doc, I’ve broke me arm in seven places… ‘Don’t go back to them seven places, then.’ A meeting [to discuss a new contract] was set up between me, my agent Andy Evans, Hodgson and the Fulham chief executive Alistair Mackintosh. Andy and I met up with the chief exec, but there was no sign of Roy. Alistair was a bit confused by that and called him, only to find out he was playing golf and wouldn’t be coming. That was the end of that meeting. I thought it was bang out of order. It doesn’t matter if you’re the chairman, owner or manager, you have to treat people with respect and that’s pretty much what I told Roy the next time I saw him. I asked him where he’d been when we were supposed to have had a meeting and I told him it showed me and my agent a lack of respect. Perhaps I shouldn’t have been so hostile, but his decision not to attend that meeting spoke volumes. Bullard played under Hodgson at Fulham between 2007 and 2009, helping the club avoid relegation in 2008 .

"Gerardo Martino has moved to quash fears over Angel di Maria's dip in form at Manchester United, claiming his explosive start to life in the Premier League was atypical for a foreign import. Ahead of Argentina's star-studded friendly against Portugal at Old Trafford, the head coach was at pains to point out that Di Maria's performances during this season's infancy were at odds with what was expected. The 26-year-old made a big-money move to United from Real Madrid over the summer and appears to have not been exempt to the suffering felt by Louis van Gaal's squad during a campaign to have started slower than David Moyes' ill-fated reign. Angel di Maria's look on during his team's training session at Manchester City's training complex . Gerardo Martino addressed the media before the clash and backed Di Maria to shine at Old Trafford . Cost: £60m from Real Madrid (August 2014) Debut: Burnley (a) 30 August . Games: 9 . Goals: 3 . Assists: 5 . United can point towards an ever-expanding injury list as reason enough for lagging behind Chelsea at the top of the Premier League. Questions are, however, beginning to circulate as to why their £60million signing has not dragged the Reds through games - notably in the defeat against Manchester City and draw at West Brom. Martino inferred that Di Maria has been a victim of his own early success. 'I have to say that Angel is one of the very top players in world football,' he said. 'His start was exceptional and the fact that generally when players go to a new club and have to get used to a new league, a new team, a different style of football and different team-mates, I think the form that he is showing now is possibly more typical of a player going to a new club than the very first few games when he burst onto the scene and did so well.' Arguments rage as to how best Van Gaal utilises Di Maria, but Martino opted to turn that round; the former Barcelona boss believes the midfielder is capable of plugging any gaps needed in the north-west. There is a sense that trial and error may be the way for United to grow long-term. Di Maria scored three times in his first five Manchester United games, but his form has tailed off slightly . Argentina manager Martino takes a training session at Manchester City's Carrington base on Monday . 'With regards to his position, I would say that Angel is the type of player who can play a number of different roles expertly,' he added. 'You only have to look a few seasons back when he played on the right side for Real Madrid and in the season just gone, he featured more on the inside-left in a slighter freer role. 'Obviously, in the World Cup, he did very well when he played wide left so really, in terms of positioning, he can adapt to anywhere where the manager asks him to play.' Martino was full of praise for his players before the North-West showdown and claims Lionel Messi should win the Ballon d'Or as well as insisting Argentina's clash against Portugal is one worth watching. The former Barcelona boss looks set to start Messi, despite playing a full 90 minutes at Upton Park last week, and characterises the friendly as important in gauging how far his side has to go ahead of next year's Copa America. 'You can't take out that I am Argentine. I'm not the best person to judge because I can't separate sentiment. I'm not the most objective I would still vote for him [Messi.] . Martino has backed Messi (right) to win the Ballon d'Or, with the Argentine shielding the Manchester cold from his hands along with team-mate Javier Mascherano during Monday's training session . Messi scored the winning goal in a 2-1 win against Croatia at Upton Park and is set to start vs Portugal . 'Games like this are a good test for us in trying to lessen the amount of space. We are famous for our attacking style but we've got to try and balance out how we defend on a team. 'It's always a good feeling when you're playing in a stadium like this and each game has importance. It's all about constantly improving the squad. I've picked my team already. 'The idea is to look at as many as we possibly can but we need a base of players who are a nucleus. We hope to give some fresh faces a run out. 'These games and tours abroad are similar for all managers. We try to get on together and build a spirit but at the same time everyone is trying to win their place. Our short-term objective is the Copa America. 'Coaches can dress friendlies up to be more relevant than they are but we have the World Cup runner-up and a huge team in Europe so you don't need to dress this up. 'We've both got greater aims - Copa America and the Euros - but it is an important game and we'll be approaching it with the seriousness you'd expect.'","Argentina and Portugal will clash in friendly at Old Trafford on Tuesday .

"Nos 50-41: Includes Albert Luque, David Ngog and Claudio Pizarro. The centre forward: The leader from the front, the No 9, the provider, the talisman, the goalscorer. Since 1992, the Premier League has been blessed with the best, from homegrown talents Alan Shearer and Andy Cole, to foreign imports Tony Yeboah and Thierry Henry, but unfortunately there have also been some major disappointments. Whether failing to justify their huge price tag, or just incapable of hitting a barn door, there have been some dreadful forwards in England's top flight. As we build-up to the return of the Premier League following the international break, Sportsmail runs you through Nos 40-31 of the worst strikers to have ever played in the division... do you agree? 40) Jon Dahl Tomasson (Newcastle United) Tomasson went on to win the Champions League and Serie A with AC Milan, the UEFA Cup and Eredivisie with Feyenoord and the Bundesliga with Stuttgart - yet the Dane was utterly hopeless during his season at Newcastle United. Arriving as a fresh-faced 21-year-old in 1997 for £2.2million from Heerenveen, Tomasson simply was not strong enough to cope with the Premier League and found himself bullied by opposition defenders. He was shifted forward to the striker position from his preferred attacking midfield role due to an injury to Alan Shearer and managed just three goals in 23 league appearances for the Magpies. Newcastle fans are still to this day bemused as to how Tomasson scored 52 goals in 112 games for Denmark - because his talent certainly went missing when he was on Tyneside. Jon Dahl Tomasson signed for Newcastle United in 1997 but struggled to adapt to the pace and power of the Premier League . The Danish striker, pictured against Dynamo Kiev in the Champions League in October 1997, lasted just one year on Tyneside . 39) Erik Meijer (Liverpool) Remembered fondly for singing and drinking with Liverpool fans in Dortmund before the 2001 UEFA Cup final, Meijer's actual footballing ability is not reminisced about in quite such a positive manner. The Dutchman moved to Liverpool in 1999 on a free transfer having torn Bundesliga defences to shreds in partnership with Ulf Kirsten at Bayer Leverkusen. Though Meijer himself physically upped sticks and moved to England, his form remained firmly in Germany. No goals arrived during in 24 Premier League games during his two-year stay on Merseyside and he was loaned out to Preston North End (where he also failed to score...) before leaving for Hamburg. Well, at least he knew how to enjoy a pint anyway... Erik Meijer (centre) signed for Liverpool from Bayer Leverkusen on a free transfer in 1999 but failed to score a single Premier League goal . The Dutchman, holding his arms aloft against Sunderland (left) and Hull City, did enjoy a drink with Liverpool fans in Dortmund though . Darko Kovacevic signed for Sheffield Wednesday from Red Star Belgrade in 1996 but scored just four goals in 16 Premier League games . 38) Darko Kovacevic (Sheffield Wednesday) When you sign a striker who has just scored an incredible 37 goals in 47 games for Red Star Belgrade in a £2m deal, you expect to be getting a bit of a bargain. But Serbian Kovacevic's spell in the Steel City in 1996 was not one he will want to remember in a hurry. Four goals did arrive in 16 Premier League appearances, including two on his debut against Bolton Wanderers, but he departed less than six months after his arrival to head to Spain with Real Sociedad. Kovacevic was criticised for his poor heading ability, his poor first touch and lack of movement - but apart from that, Owls fans thought he was incredible... 37) Jozy Altidore (Hull City and Sunderland) The American has 74 caps for his country - just let that sink in for a second. Incredibly, Altidore has scored everywhere he has been - except in England. He netted 15 league goals for New York Red Bulls and 39 for AZ Alkmaar - as well as bagging 24 international goals to date for the USA - but has managed just two strikes in the Premier League. A season-long loan move to Hull City in 2009 from Villarreal yielded just a solitary goal in 28 games during his first spell in England, but his second stint in the Premier League was supposed to be the making of him. Having recovered his form in Holland in blistering style, Altidore was signed by Sunderland in 2013 for £6.5m but has netted just once in 33 league games since. Sometimes Jozy, things just aren't meant to be... Jozy Altidore was signed by Sunderland for £6.5m from AZ Alkmaar in 2013 but has struggled in the Premier League . Despite being a prolific scorer for the USA national team, Altidore's record with Hull City and Sunderland is appalling . 36) Konstantinos Mitroglou (Fulham) Steve Marlet was considered a waste of money at Loftus Road, but Mitroglou arguably tops that. During their ill-fated relegation campaign last season, Fulham splashed £12m on the Greece international in January in a bid to stave off the drop - but their investment proved to be a disastrous one. Mitroglou had scored 41 league goals in 92 appearances for Olympiacos but injuries plagued him during his time in west London and he managed just three Premier League games for Fulham. Instead of being their saviour, he turned in to their benchwarmer instead. He returned to the Greek champions on loan in August but it is safe to say Fulham fans will not be worried if he doesn't return. Konstantinos Mitroglou signed for Fulham in January for £12m from Greek side Olympiacos but played just three league games . 35) Rolando Bianchi (Manchester City) Manchester City can spend £8.8m nowadays and not even bat an eyelid - but when they parted with that sum to sign Bianchi from Reggina in July 2007, they were counting on recruiting a top striker. The Italian was given the No 10 shirt at the Sky Blues and scored on his debut against West Ham United but things quickly went downhill from there. Bianchi lambasted English cuisine and was scathing in his views on the British alcohol culture - insisting he needed to return to Italy in order to progress as a player and earn international recognition. He scored four Premier League goals in 19 games before heading on loan to Lazio in January 2008 and then signing permanently for Torino that summer. He has enjoyed his pizza and pasta back home ever since. Rolando Bianchi signed for Manchester City for £8.8m from Reggina in July 2007 but hated English cuisine and the alcohol culture . Bianchi (left) is tackled by Derby County's Claude Davis during a Premier League match in August 2007 . 34) Andriy Voronin (Liverpool) The Ukrainian striker was slow - a snail caught in a trail of treacle could move around the pitch quicker - and this greatly affected his success in England. Having signed for Liverpool on a free transfer from Bayer Leverkusen in July 2007, he originally impressed on his debut - with Rafa Benitez even insisting that he was 'clever', had 'great game awareness' and gave Liverpool 'many more options in attack'. That opinion was to be short-lived, however... With just five league goals in his first season on Merseyside, Voronin was loaned to Hertha Berlin before returning to Anfield for another year. He was sold to Dynamo Moscow for £4m in 2010 having netted just five goals in 27 Premier League appearances. He has not been missed. Andriy Voronin scored just five Premier League goals in 27 appearances during his three years at Liverpool . Voronin winces after missing a chance for Liverpool against Birmingham City in April 2008 (left) and against Everton in October 2007 . 33) Helder Postiga (Tottenham Hotspur) Having just won the Portuguese title with Porto, 20-year-old Postiga was lauded as a brilliant signing for Tottenham Hotspur when they snapped him up for what seemed a very reasonable starting price of £6.25m in 2003. But the striker struggled to adapt to the Premier League - never coping with the pace, power and intensity of matches - and Spurs fans soon became disillusioned with his performances. His rating as one of the best strikers in Europe was quickly revised as he scored just once in 19 Premier League games. Incredibly, Postiga was supposedly wanted by Jose Mourinho while in charge at Real Madrid but the deal failed to materialise.

As soon as he arrived at White Hart Lane, however, it became clear he was not a Premier League footballer. Martin Jol had described his as a 'tall target man; a hard-working, honest player with a good goal-scoring record.' So, what happened to it at Spurs? Rasiak struggled to control a ball, he was slow and just did not look at home on the pitch in England's top flight, leading Spurs fans to view him as a laughing stock. He failed to score in any of his eight Premier League appearances and was loaned to Southampton. The Saints then signed him permanently before he spent time at Bolton Wanderers, again failing to score in seven Premier League games. He was just awful unfortunately.

Unfortunately for Rasiak (left), the majority of his time at White Hart Lane was spent warming the bench . 31) Massimo Maccarone (Middlesbrough) Maccarone signed for £8.15m from Empoli in 2002 after dazzling at the European Under 21 Championship and Middlesbrough had been forced to hold off strong competition from other clubs. The Italian started well on Teesside but scored just 18 Premier League goals in 81 games during five years at the Riverside Stadium. He was loaned to Parma and Siena before moving to the latter permanently in 2007 on a free transfer - having spent half a decade failing to light up the English game. Although Middlesbrough fans remember him fondly for his workrate, endeavour and attitude, his obvious lack of footballing ability ensured they were tearing their hair out when it came to watching the Italian in front of goal. His record at most other clubs is fairly solid, but on Teesside it was woeful.

"CLICK HERE to see which English duo the Barcelona playmaker would have loved to have played with during his career . Barcelona playmaker Xavi believes his superstar team-mate Lionel Messi would be an even bigger hit in the Premier League than he has been in La Liga. The 34-year-old, who has won an incredible seven La Liga titles and three Champions League crowns during his time at the club, believes the defensive philosophy in England would mean the 27-year-old would cause absolute havoc. He told BBC Sport: 'I think he'd be even better in the Premier League because it is not so defensive. Lionel Messi has established himself as one of, if not the best player in the world at Barcelona . Xavi, pictured in action for Barcelona last season, believes Messi would be even better in the Premier League . Messi runs away in celebration after scoring Barcelona's second goal against Ajax earlier this month . 'When defending against Barcelona, they [English clubs] play on a 1 v 1 basis, defending with passion, and a lot of energy. 'But Leo would find more spaces than in La Liga.'

"They have spent the last six years as rivals on the pitch and on the Ballon d’Or short-list yet we have never seen them sharing so much as a post-match conversation, much less swapping shirts. As Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo prepare to face each other when Argentina play Portugal at Old Trafford on Tuesday, Pete Jenson looks at the rivalry and asks: do they really despise each other or is there a begrudging mutual respect? Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo go head-to-head when Argentina play Portugal at Old Trafford . Unpleasant nicknames . In his book about Jose Mourinho’s three years at Real Madrid, Diego Torres wrote that some of the people around Ronaldo had taken to referring to Messi as ‘the dwarf’ whenever they discussed him. The term seems to have been applied to motivate Ronaldo and convince him that he was better than the four-times Ballon d’Or winner. What Torres never suggests is that the derogatory comment ever came from Ronaldo himself. In Guillem Ballague’s book Messi, Ronaldo is said to refer to the Barcelona player as ‘Cabronazo’ in the Real Madrid dressing room. The Spanish swearword is translated as a particularly colourful epithet in the English version of the book but could just as easily be rendered as ‘bastard’, which in the context of a psyched-up dressing room before a Clasico would be nothing out of the ordinary. Ronaldo denies ever disrespecting Messi, tweeting in midweek: ‘I have the utmost respect for all my professional colleagues, and Messi is obviously no exception.’ Messi trains with the Argentina squad at Manchester City's Carrington training centre . Brilliant for their clubs, Messi and Ronaldo have failed to deliver on the international stage . The wages war . Much of Ronaldo’s Messi-directed ire stems from his sense of injustice at not always being treated the same. At the 2012 European Footballer of the Year ceremony, Ronaldo was furious that then Barcelona president Sandro Rosell accompanied Messi and eventual winner Andres Iniesta to the presentation while Real Madrid president Florentino Perez stayed at home, sending low-ranking director Pedro Lopez in his place. Ronaldo at the time was also entering his fourth season at the club still with his original deal in place while it seemed Messi’s contract was being improved on an almost half-yearly basis. By September 2013 Perez had awarded Ronaldo a new five-year deal worth £17million a season putting him above Messi, whose deal was renewed at the end of the season to restore parity. Real Madrid forward Ronaldo and his girlfriend Irina Shayk . Barcelona forward Messi and his girlfriend Antonella Roccuzzo . The image . For years Messi came across as the shy, humble, boy wonder while Ronaldo was the brash poseur with the model girlfriend. But the image of both men has changed. Reporters at Portugal’s World Cup play-off win over Sweden in 2013 will never forget Ronaldo wandering through the press area with his then three-year-old son, Ronaldo Jnr, leading the way, telling the assembled media, ‘He never fails’ after his father’s goal had given Portugal a 1-0 lead. When Ronaldo stopped to answer questions there was a tug on the trouser leg from his son who had the media in stitches saying: ‘Let’s go, daddy, I am sleeping with you tonight?’ But while Ronaldo’s image has softened, Messi’s has hardened. A tax evasion case against him and his father is going through the courts. And he has been depicted as an at-times authoritarian figure in the Barca dressing room. It is claimed that after Real Madrid won 2-1 in Pep Guardiola’s last Clasico in 2012, the coach sought out Messi only to be dismissed by the player who told him: ‘What you should have done is pick a team to win, instead of what you did do.’ It is also said that Messi texted from the back of the team bus to Guardiola at the front criticising him for giving Zlatan Ibrahimovic Messi’s central-striking berth in one game in 2009. Ronaldo and Messi have not exactly swapped personas. It is still Ronaldo who steps out with Russian model Irina Shayk, and Messi is unlikely to become an underwear model anytime soon, but the pair are no longer quite at opposite ends of the personality spectrum they once were. Both are doting dads and both can be driven and dominating forces in the dressing room. Much of Ronaldo’s Messi-directed ire stems from his sense of injustice . Boy wonder while Ronaldo was the brash poseur with the model girlfriend . International let-downs . Another thing that unites them has been their failure to deliver on the international stage. Ronaldo went home after the group matches of this summer’s World Cup and was the subject of more headlines off the pitch than on it with constant concerns over his fitness and a bizarre topless model stalker, the Brazilian former Miss Bumbum, having to be banned from Portugal’s training sessions. Messi had a better tournament but was still unable to emulate Diego Maradona by winning the trophy as Argentina lost to Germany in the final. Both men will now probably finish their careers without a World Cup winners’ medal and both will understand the frustration of not being able to meet national expectations. Messi has been depicted as an at-times authoritarian figure in the Barca dressing room . An Old Trafford embrace? Will these shared sentiments help bring about a thaw in relations as they meet in relatively friendly circumstances on Tuesday? Or will club allegiances and their ongoing battle to stay ahead in the Ballon d’Or stakes, and in the all-time Champions League goals table, keep the cold war going until they both hang up their boots? The Messi-Ronaldo embrace will no doubt come one day. Tuesday might still be too soon.","Argentina's Lionel Messi and Portugal's Cristiano Ronaldo go head-to-head at Old Trafford on Tuesday .

"Wayne Rooney has revealed he tried to get Cristiano Ronaldo sent off during the famous World Cup match in which he ended up seeing red thanks to the mischievous antics of his former Manchester United team-mate. Rooney will enter an illustrious club on Saturday when he wins his 100th England cap against Slovenia at Wembley. The lowest moment of his 11-year international career came in the 2006 World Cup when he was sent off for a stamp on Ricardo Carvalho. Referee Horavio Elizondo shows a red card to Wayne Rooney during the 2006 World Cup quarter-final . England's Wayne Rooney stamps on Portugal's Ricardo Carvalho before being shown a red card . Ronaldo, then a team-mate of Rooney's, played a big part in the red card, rushing over to Argentinian referee Horacio Elizondo to plead for the striker's dismissal. Ronaldo, who famously winked towards the bench after the red card had been issued, scored the winning penalty as Portugal beat England in a shoot-out to reach the semi-finals. Eight years on, Rooney holds no grudge against the Portugal forward. In fact, Rooney says he would have acted in exactly the same way as the Real Madrid star. 'I understood why he did it. He was trying to win for Portugal,' the England captain said. 'And to be honest I would probably do the same if it was the other way round. I would want to win for England. 'I would have probably (tried to get him sent off), yes,' Rooney added, with a smile. The England skipper admitted he had earlier pestered the referee in the hope that he would book the Portuguese. Cristiano Ronaldo gives a sly wink to the Portugal bench after Rooney was sent off in Gelsenkirchen . 'In the first half I was saying to the referee that he was diving, trying to get him a yellow card,' Rooney said. 'That happens in football. Players speak to the referees which isn't always highlighted. But that does happen.' Many expected Ronaldo to leave United following the incident, but Rooney selflessly buried the hatchet with the forward for the sake of their club's success. 'I spoke to him straight after the game,' Rooney added. 'I knew what the media would say - the two of us had fallen out. Rooney (left) and Ronaldo were team-mates at Manchester United, pictured here in August 2006 . 'To be honest, we had to make sure that didn't happen for Manchester United's sake because the tournament for me and England was over. There was never an issue.' Rooney had much soul-searching to do following the sending-off, which came after a period of domination for Sven-Goran Eriksson's team in Gelsenkirchen. 'It was so difficult to watch knowing no matter what happened my tournament was over,' Rooney said. Rooney poses with a special shirt to celebrate what will be his 100th cap against Slovenia on Saturday . 'That was a really tough moment and unfortunately we didn't go through and it made it worse for me. 'You start thinking: 'Is it my fault that we didn't go through?'.

"Scotland came close to ending their interminable wait for a first victory over the mighty All Blacks with a stirring performance at BT Murrayfield. But, once again, the cold fact is they failed to exploit a New Zealand off-day and lost. The tourists were a pale shadow of the World Cup winners, unsurprisingly after coach Steve Hansen made 13 changes to the side who beat England last week. Combinations lacked rhythm, balls were frequently lost from hand and in contact, and twin legends Richie McCaw and Dan Carter coughed up a bizarre amount of possession between them in the first half.

However, crucially, for all the unstinting effort and ambition they showed, the Scots also lacked the cohesion to turn possession into the necessary points. After a towering display in the win over Argentina, captain Greig Laidlaw was left wondering ‘what if’ as he sent a penalty wide with just 10 minutes remaining that would have put Scotland 18-17 ahead. New Zealand were rattled but, minutes later, they responded quickly with a try from lock Jeremy Thrush to seal their victory. The game started at a furious pace. Ross Ford continued where he left off last week with accurate line-outs and Jonny Gray’s varying of the receiver perplexed the All Blacks. But, typical of the nature of the game, a big tackle by Russell and Harley on All Blacks debutant James Parsons lifted the crowd and led to a turnover and break by Richie Gray — but he was penalised in the ensuing ruck, only for Carter miss the target with his first penalty.

However, within three minutes of that try, Tommy Seymour intercepted a McCaw pass to Vito and sped away for Scotland’s first score. Laidlaw converted to put the Scots 7-5 ahead. Scotland then lost Mark Bennett to a hamstring injury and prop Euan Murray, in bristling form, followed. Seymour almost snatched another intercept before Carter goaled his first kick before making it two after the half-hour.

Laidlaw converted a penalty but Carter replied to send the All Blacks in at the interval 14-10 up. A backlash was expected from the tourists in the second half, but it was Scotland who started strongly with a fine attack from Hogg, Lamont and Seymour.

French referee Romain Poite then penalised a squint feed at the scrum by Laidlaw, infuriating the crowd as he had paid no attention to similar feeds from both sides in the first half, but still Scotland could not retain ball long enough to develop a consistency in attack. All Blacks coach Hansen began to off-load his experienced bench with four replacements in five minutes. They included Sonny Bill Williams for the subdued Malakai Fekitoa and Julian Savea for Carter, with Slade shifting to his accustomed stand-off berth. Their experience was obvious as blocking moves started to appear in their attack. Subtle, but illegal work in the maul and breakdown, raised the ire of Scots. But Scotland were not done. A fine tackle and turnover by Lamont set the attack on the front foot, Richie Gray steaming up the field and Johnnie Beattie showing stirring intent with a break minutes after replacing Ashe. However, New Zealand were intent on keeping Scotland penned deep in their own half and with ferocious defending — much of it from offside positions which Poite and his assistants seemed unable to see — the Scots could not escape. Scotland stand arm in  arms as the All Blacks deliver one of their intimidating hakas . The clock ticked past the hour mark with the score still 14-13 to New Zealand, and the pre-match optimism among Scotland fans was taking on a new tangible quality. Slade converted a penalty in the 65th minute to nudge the All Blacks into a four-point lead, but Laidlaw responded in kind from a ruck penalty won by Geoff Cross. And then Scotland had the chance to take the lead. After a superb line-out take by the impressive Harley and a fine run by Lamont, . Poite finally penalised New Zealand for offside. But Laidlaw struck his kick just wide of the upright from 15 metres in from the left touch. The game entered the final 10 minutes with the Murrayfield crowd roaring. But there seemed to be a hesitancy from the Scots, perhaps struggling to believe the chance to strike a historic first win over New Zealand was in their hands. The All Blacks then pounced. A slick pass from Sam Cane to Thrush sent the lock diving over, Slade converting to open up an eight-point, and winning lead.","New Zealand scored two tries to Scotland's one at Murrayfield in their Autumn International on Saturday .

"England slumped to their fifth successive defeat against the All Blacks and a fourth in five months. Amid a monsoon at Twickenham, this was a demoralising wash-out for Stuart Lancaster’s national team. Following a summer tour of near-misses in New Zealand, this was a step back. The result was entirely justified. While a late penalty-try ensured respectability on the scoreboard, this QBE series opener became a grim mis-match after half-time. England simply ceased to exist as an attacking force, until the horse had bolted. The world champions took an iron grip on proceedings and displayed all their experience and nous. Steve Hansen’s men played the conditions far more shrewdly as England floundered deep in their own half. There was all the usual white-shirted courage and endeavour, but when it came to clever decision-making and composure under pressure, they were exposed and out-classed. VIDEOS Scroll down to watch .

Referee: Nigel Owens (WAL) This was not the outcome or the performance Lancaster and his assistants would have wanted to ignite their autumn campaign and their long-range countdown to the World Cup. They will have to quickly lick their wounds and prepare for a daunting clash with the mighty Springboks next Saturday. The management will be desperate to avert the dreaded prospect of another defeat, meaning the wait to generate precious winning momentum goes on. In the build-up to this match, much had been made of the fact that the All Blacks had been together for months and would thus come to Twickenham armed with momentum and cohesion. Yet, it was England – in action for the first time in five months – who exploded into life at the start of this Test. Within four minutes, the hosts were ahead and their opening score was a wondrous try. The ball came to Brad Barritt in midfield and the Saracens centre’s superbly-judged pass released Jonny May at full throttle. He surged past Conrad Smith and then backed his pace to burst along the left wing, outside a diving Israel Dagg, to race over in the corner. It was a blistering strike which raised the roof. Although Owen Farrell missed the wide conversion, England were up and running – in every sense – and they so nearly extended their lead just three minutes later. A box-kick by Danny Care into the New Zealand 22 bounced up awkwardly and May won the leap to claim the ball, but he was just unable to off-load to Farrell who was alongside in support, with the line clear in front of him. Lancaster’s team kept coming, storming forwards in waves of bold intent. They should have had a second try in the 10th minute when Kyle Eastmond’s audacious, flat, cut-out pass picked out Mike Brown on the overlap on the right, but the full back fumbled. It was a costly error, as the All Blacks were soon on terms. Ben Smith brilliantly re-gathered Aaron Cruden’s high kick near halfway and the visitors pounded deep into enemy territory. Julian Savea broke through Care’s tackle then the ball was shipped across to the right and the imposing Jerome Kaino smashed his way past Courtney Lawes in the 22.

From the ruck, Aaron Smith’s short pass sent Cruden lunging for the line and referee Nigel Owens awarded the try, even though replays suggested there was some doubt about the legitimacy of the try. Cruden missed the conversion and the scores were level. The initial drama gave way to a relative lull, as England used their rolling maul to telling effect and two Farrell penalties re-established their advantage before Cruden struck back at the other end to make it 11-8. The kicking duel continued as Farrell missed a drop-goal shot six minutes before the break, but after Cruden briefly levelled the contest at 11-11, England’s No 10 struck his third penalty to send his side in 14-11 up at the break. Yet, home rule was short-lived after half-time. A 43rd-minute Cruden penalty attempt hit the post, but the Kiwis were cranking up the tempo and intensity, and they took the lead six minutes into the second half. They were building steadily on the left when England’s debutant lock, George Kruis – on for Lawes – raced out of the defensive line but failed to make his tackle and the space he left behind was clinically exploited. Owen Franks rumbled forward and quick ball to the left allowed Richie McCaw to score from Dagg’s pass, even though he had to take the ball behind him before scoring. Cruden couldn’t add the extras from an awkward angle, but the world champions were firmly in the ascendancy and England were reeling. Eastmond had a kick charged down and Semesa Rokoduguni had to scramble back to cover. At the ruck, Sam Whitelock tried to stretch through to ground the loose ball over the line, but he was judged to have knocked on. Seconds later, a scuffle in the corner led to New Zealand hooker Dane Coles being sin-binned for kicking out after having his shirt pulled.

The numerical advantage presented England with a prime opportunity to hit back, but they squandered the 10-minute window – striving to attack from deep in a haphazard fashion, in deteriorating conditions, while their rivals played a smart territorial game to keep their noses in front. Beauden Barrett missed a penalty shot in the 64th minute but the Kiwis just kept up the onslaught. Sonny Bill Williams stormed clear into the 22 but ignored team-mates in support and was tackled short. However, the All Blacks won another penalty and Barrett struck it to increase the lead to five points. As the rain became torrential, England were washed away. New Zealand struck again eight minutes from time as a patient assault through countless precise phases culminated in Charlie Faumuina burrowing over. The home side rallied in the closing moments to snatch a penalty try from a strong scrum – which George Ford converted with a drop kick – but it was too little, too late.

"Boy, that was close. Scotland looked like we might beat New Zealand for this first time in our history but, in the end, we were just not quite good enough. The All Blacks were there for the taking and we might never get a better chance to beat them. Over the last number of years, I’ve had to draw the positives out of defeat after defeat and sometimes it’s been tough to do. Not so from Saturday. There were so many positives, the main one being that Scotland are a credible team on the international stage again. Granted, this was not the New Zealand first team but has there ever been a poor All Black or a poor All Black side? These players might not be first choice in New Zealand but they would be in many other countries. So to match them in many parts of the game, to completely dominate them at line-out time and to be in touching distance right at the end was hugely encouraging. Scotland pushed New Zealand all the way before suffering a narrow defeat at Murrayfield on Saturday . I would have loved Greig Laidlaw to have kicked over that penalty which would have given us the lead with eight minutes to go. I would have loved to see how Scotland would have reacted to taking the lead and how New Zealand would have reacted to going behind. We probably know the answer to that one as they have been in that situation many times before and, more often than not, have found a way to win the game. What we don’t know is how Scotland would have coped with the pressure of trying to close out a game against a team they have never beaten before. But to be contemplating such a scenario proves how far this young team have come in these last two games. They put everything into the game and just came up short - but what a learning experience it was for so many players. Rob Harley was immense. He went toe-to-toe with the great Ritchie McCaw and more than matched him throughout the game. His effort and engine were phenomenal and he should take huge confidence from mixing it with that company and playing so well. Finn Russell was another who was up against one of the best stand-offs of all time in Dan Carter. This time last year Russell was playing for Ayr and there he was, one year on, smashing Carter back in the tackle and running the game for Scotland. He has, without a doubt, a big future and could be our stand-off for many years to come. Jeremy Thrush (centre) and Victor Vito both scored tries in a 24-16 win for New Zealand . I was really impressed with Scotland’s desire to play and to take the game to New Zealand. They were prepared to try things even when deep in their own 22 and asked huge questions of the visiting defence. When it stood firm, Scotland were still able to recycle the ball and try again which proves how good they were in contact. In the past, we would have conceded a penalty or a try from turnover ball. This team plays with real ambition but also has the accuracy and quality to back it up. It was a great experience being at BT Murrayfield on Saturday night. For years, the pre-match entertainment there has been the best of any venue I’ve been to but then the team’s performance hasn’t matched it. The light show was amazing and created a wonderful spectacle and arena for the game to follow and, at last, we now have a team who can live up to the hype. They have real quality and real character. I liked how they reacted to conceding an early try. It came from a bad missed tackle by Alex Dunbar but he shrugged it off and put in a huge performance. They did not stand off New Zealand and pressured them into making mistakes, like when Tommy Seymour intercepted McCaw’s pass for our try. It was a brilliant example of reading the situation and making the right decision and it brought us right back in the game. Considering the average margin of defeat in the last four games against the All Blacks has been 35 points, a defeat by only eight suggests real progress. Scotland are definitely moving in the right direction. Vern Cotter has made a big difference, and the future looks bright.","New Zealand beat Scotland 24-16 at Murrayfield in autumn international .

"The All Blacks rolled into Cardiff on Sunday night with a simple message for Wales: we’re coming at you fully loaded. Head coach Steve Hansen has promised to select his strongest side for the Test at the Millennium Stadium after a second-string New Zealand line-up scraped to victory over Scotland on Saturday. Wales have not beaten the Kiwis since 1953 and Hansen is plotting to extend the 25-match winning run against a side low on confidence after their uninspiring 17-13 win over Fiji. ‘We’ll look to pick the best team we can to counter what Wales will bring,’ said Hansen. New Zealand head coach Steve Hansen says he will pick a side to beat Wales on Saturday . All Blacks stars Richie McCaw and Dan Carter (below) are superstars in rugby mad Wales . Carter struggled on his return to the starting line-up against Scotland at the weekend . ‘We will try and pick the best players we’ve got to do that. Wales are a good side. I’m not sure why they’re ranked where they are; I think they should be ranked higher. ‘They finished fourth at the World Cup and all they’ve done since then is improve their team. They’ve got big wingers and a big back three. Their midfield is strong and there aren’t too many bigger than (Jamie) Roberts.’ The southern hemisphere giants received a far more high-profile welcome in Cardiff than Wales’ previous opponents, with television cameras and eager supporters waiting outside their city-centre hotel to catch a glimpse of Richie McCaw, Dan Carter and Sonny Bill Williams. It was a stark contrast to Fiji’s reception in the Welsh capital and an indication of the huge step up in performance required if Warren Gatland’s side are going to emerge from this weekend’s Test with their credibility in tact. Hansen noted the size and strength of a Welsh midfield featuring Jamie Roberts as reason to be worried . George North forms part of an imposing back three for the hosts who haven't beaten NZ since 1953 . Wales conceded a staggering 22 turnovers against the South Sea Islanders on Saturday and such poor ball retention against New Zealand will be punished. This weekend’s showdown has already been dubbed ‘Black Saturday’ and Wales have to make exponential improvements if they are going to avoid an embarrassing defeat in Cardiff. Luke Charteris says if Wales improve their accuracy they can force an unlikely victory over the visitors . Returning skipper Sam Warburton will need to be at his inspirational best but team-mate Luke Charteris believes an unlikely victory is not out of the question. ‘Against Fiji, they are always going to grab the ball and are capable of scoring some great tries,’ said Charteris. ‘A lot of boys who played last week said this game felt harder. It was just accuracy and, against New Zealand, we know if they turn the ball over they will score. One thing we will work on this week is retaining the ball. If we do that, then we are capable of beating New Zealand.’ Poor performances from Gatland’s fringe players have made some calls easier than others ahead of Monday’s team announcement. But the most difficult decisions rest on the selection of Liam Williams and Richard Hibbard at full back and hooker. Williams made 224 metres — three times more than any of his team-mates — on Saturday but now faces competition from Leigh Halfpenny, who is hoping to be back in contention after suffering concussion against Australia. In the pack, Gatland must decide whether to wield the axe over hooker Hibbard. The Gloucester forward is caught in the crossfire of a club-versus-country row, having shunned medical advice from the Wales team doctor to feature in Friday night’s defeat by Harlequins. His boots were filled on Saturday by Ospreys debutant Scott Baldwin, whose afternoon started well with a dominant performance at the line-out, but fell apart as Fiji launched a comeback in the second half. Liam Williams was man of the match against Fiji but his place is under threat by Leigh Halfpenny's return . Despite having Campese Ma’afu sent off in the 53rd minute, the tourists almost snatched victory with a showing inspired by 20st 2lb centre Nemani Nadolo. The Crusaders goliath will be hoping to continue his incredible scoring record — which now stands at 13 tries in 15 Tests — at next year’s World Cup. Fiji have become the forgotten team of the pool stages, but scrum-half Nikola Matawalu has warned the bigger nations to write-off the underdogs at their peril. ‘We are in the pool of death with England, Wales, Australia and Uruguay,’ said Matawalu. ‘It will be hard but it will be immense. We come over here and we play the next day. If we can have time, like a month, then we can make a difference in that pool. Any team can beat any team, so it is open.’","New Zealand arrived in Wales on Sunday night to a heroes' welcome .

"Wayne Rooney has paid a fascinating and insightful tribute to his family — wife Coleen and sons Kai and Klay — after helped him celebrate the milestone of winning his 100th England cap. Team Rooney were at Wembley to see Dad join the likes of Bobby Moore and David Beckham in the exclusive 100 club and he in turn has revealed for the first time the key role they play in his life and career. Rooney, who will turn 30 next year, is a vastly different person from the callow youth who first appeared on television screens chewing gum when he picked up the BBC’s Young Sports Personality of the Year award in 2002. Wayne Rooney was joined by his two sons Kai and Klay on the Wembley turf ahead of England's qualifier . Rooney, pictured holding younger son Klay, has revealed his family have played a major role in his career . The 29-year-old took to Instagram to state it was 'amazing to walk out' with his sons . He says daily games of football with his two boys in the back garden of their home in Cheshire is the one time he feels he can truly escape the pressures of being Wayne Rooney the superstar. And Coleen, the childhood sweetheart he married in a glittering £5million ceremony in Italy, remains an important counsel when making the major decisions in his career, including the desire to carry on playing for England as long as they want him, as Beckham did. Rooney says that it’s 18-month-old Klay — named in tribute to boxer Muhammad Ali, who was born Cassius Clay — who is presently showing more interest in football than five-year-old Kai. ‘I take them out into the garden most days and have a kickabout with the two of them. It’s my youngest lad who wants to stay there longer, he’s obsessed,’ says Rooney with a clear sense of pride. ‘They’re special moments for me because everywhere I go in the world there are photographers or fans coming up. ‘Once I go to my house – there’s very few people come to my house and I like that to stay private. That’s where I can be myself, a human being and a father rather than a footballer. ‘It would be nice if one of the boys wanted to be a footballer, but I have said before that it’s down to them and if they want to do it. ‘My eldest lad goes to football lessons but at the minute he’s not too interested in it. My youngest lad since the first day he could walk he’s been wanting a ball. He kicks a ball around everywhere he goes so they’re different characters. Klay has been practicing his football skills since the moment he could walk, according to the England captain . Coleen Rooney was also at Wembley to see her husband claim his 100th international cap . Rooney, pictured looking towards Kai, was awarded a golden cap by Sir Bobby Charlton . ‘I’ll be honest, I always thought you have to work at it being a footballer but I’ve now seen my youngest lad, without any teaching his technique is unbelievable. So I have started thinking you must be born with something. Then it’s obviously how you use it, how you work on it when you get older.’ While Klay may have inherited the football gene, Dad can already see Kai developing street-smarts. ‘He had his fifth birthday party and we had training and were going to stay at the hotel before the Man City game and I couldn’t go,’ says the Manchester United striker. ‘He’s in the same class as Robin van Persie’s daughter and I told my lad, “Sorry I can’t go, I’m playing football”. So he was testing me, saying, “Is Van Persie coming?” I said, “No, he’s at football with Daddy”. ‘He was testing me so he’s a lot cleverer than you think!’ Coleen, whom he met at school, is someone he confides in about big decisions. After the recent spate of international retirements by Steven Gerrard, Frank Lampard, Ashley Cole and Rio Ferdinand, Rooney was interested to see what she thought about prolonging his international career when he approaches his mid-thirties. England duty of course means reduced time with the family. ‘I spoke to my wife about it, I said it’s mad to see all the players are retiring. When you get to a certain age, you almost feel like you have to do it to extend your club career. Steven Gerrard and Frank Lampard decided to retire from international football after the 2014 World Cup . Rooney acknowledges the Wembley crowd before England's Euro 2016 qualifier against Slovenia . ‘She was actually very good. She was the one who said to me, “It’s a short career, you have got plenty of time to have your time off with us as a family when you finish playing and you will regret it if you do”. ‘I obviously thought, “Yes, I would”. Football is what I love doing. Playing for my country I love. I don’t think I would ever walk away.’ Rooney has already targeted the 2018 World Cup and hopes he will still be good enough to be around for Euro 2020 when the final will be held at Wembley. If he achieves that, his appearance and goalscoring records for his country might take decades to be bettered: 150 caps and 75 goals look realistic targets. Sir Alex Ferguson always maintained Rooney would have to work extra hard to stay at the top into his 30s because of his body shape. The player accepts he will never have a physique like Cristiano Ronaldo but says it’s alarmist to think his career will flatline past 30. Rooney celebrates after scoring in the 59th minute against Slovenia on his 100th appearance for his country . ‘I think when I first came into the professional game, a lot of people said my body shape won’t allow me to play for that long. But in some ways I feel it has helped me, because I am quite strong I haven’t picked up a lot of muscle injuries,’ he says. ‘They are the ones where you have seen players find it difficult to recover and be the same player, those who have hamstring injuries or thigh injuries. ‘I had a small injury in my groin last year but other than that all my injuries have been impact or a couple of cuts. I feel as fit as ever so I just have to keep working and make sure I am on top of that. ‘I don’t think I am a natural athlete when you look at some of the players’ physiques. But in terms of miles covered in training and on the pitch, I am always at the top so I think it doesn’t matter what you look like as a player physically. ‘Again, I think the next few years will be vital how I look after myself, how I do my training, that will determine how long I play on for.’ With Team Rooney — wife and boys — alongside him every step of the way.","England captain Wayne Rooney has lavished praise on his family .

"Liverpool are showing an interest in Uruguay and Benfica defender Maxi Pereira, according to Portuguese newspaper A Bola. After talks have stalled between agent and club over a contract extension with the Primeira Liga champions, the 30-year-old right back is said to be on the radar at Anfield following Glen Johnson's dip in form. With Jon Flanagan yet to make an appearance this season through injury and Javi Manquillo struggling to break into Brendan Rodgers' side, Pereira's 95 international caps will be a definite selling point for the Benfica man.

"Graeme Souness believes the time is right to take on an England side who routinely fail to make a positive impression on him and are bereft of the type of class the former Scotland midfielder was accustomed to going into Auld Enemy battles. Roy Hodgson’s ‘disappointing’ outfit have been unable to excite Souness this year — with their World Cup Finals exit in the summer confirmed just eight days into the tournament after defeats to Italy and Uruguay. The 3-1 win over Slovenia at Wembley may have continued England’s 100 per cent start to Euro 2016 qualifying but the fact they’ve been pitched in with less illustrious opposition in Group E means Souness is far from impressed. England's 100 per cent start continued with a 3-1 win over Slovenia, but Graeme Souness is not impressed . Scotland beat Ireland and Souness reckons they can trouble the English at Celtic Park . The former manager-turned-pundit would love to feel underwhelmed by their work once again on Tuesday night at Celtic Park. For that would mean resurgent Scotland stand a terrific chance of gaining revenge for a 3-2 friendly defeat at Wembley last August and confirm there is no great gulf in quality between the two national teams in this era. ‘They have been disappointing,’ said Souness of the current English crop. ‘This England team are more than beatable. It’s a great time to be playing them. I don’t see them as one of the strongest teams out there right now. ‘In the last World Cup, I know people got excited about the first game against Italy. I didn’t. At no time did I get on the edge of my seat thinking: “England are playing well here, they’re going to win a game”. They didn’t excite me. ‘I think England went to Brazil and tried to play like Spain. They didn’t play to their strengths. Their strengths are up and at ’em and playing at a certain tempo but I didn’t see that. And people like me, other professionals in the game, are not excited by it either. Souness holds some forthright views . ‘I think they will obviously qualify out of their group — and they’ve got to. They’re a nation of 55 million, so they’ve got to start making an impression at a tournament. I happen to think England has enough good players to do that, some very good players. Any great players? Not sure about that. ‘We’ll know how big the gulf is on Tuesday. We’re at home and I think it will be a close encounter. We’re organised right now, everyone knows what they’re doing. There’s always an element when we play England that we feel like underdogs. I personally never felt that but I think there’s an element of that with our players. ‘You want to run out at Hampden — or in this case Parkhead — with the crowd believing in you. That’s as much as you can ask. Right now, we’re at that stage — and we have a chance. I can see us giving a really good account of ourselves against England.’ Souness played in six Auld Enemy clashes during an international career which spanned 12 years and brought him 54 caps, tasting victory over England just once. That came in torrential rain at Hampden in 1985 when a second-half Richard Gough goal sealed a 1-0 win. That record leads Souness to claim ‘selective memory’ of the contests but he does recall slotting a penalty past Peter Shilton a year later in his final England clash as Scotland went down 2-1 in London. Glenn Hoddle, Bryan Robson and Ray Wilkins were among his midfield rivals from that period in a strong squad that went on to reach the 1986 World Cup quarter-finals then the last four at Italia ’90. There are precious few players available to Hodgson these days whom Souness could rank that highly in terms of stature. Indeed, when asked to nominate current England players with what he would regard as leadership qualities, Souness required pause for thought before he said: ‘Wayne Rooney is an obvious one. ‘He doesn’t like to lose. He’ll relish coming to Parkhead with the atmosphere and the abuse he’ll get. Who else is there? I think Gary Cahill is fast developing into a top centre-half. I was an enormous fan of Steven Gerrard but he’s no longer there. So I think they are the two obvious ones — Cahill and Rooney.’ Wayne Rooney is one player England can rely on, and will thrive in the cauldron of hate at Parkhead . James Milner remained on the bench for the duration of England’s win at Wembley 15 months ago but Souness argues that the Manchester City midfielder should be rewarded with more starts. That praise is a measure of Milner’s progress since being sidelined as a Newcastle United player under Souness nine years ago. The Scot famously commented then that his rebuilding plans for improving Newcastle did not include ‘buying a team of James Milners’. The wide man, then an England Under 21 player, has since revealed that those words motivated him and dealing with the upset helped keep him mentally strong for the career challenges which followed. Perhaps the most undervalued English player, Milner now impresses Souness. ‘I really like him,’ he said. ‘He’d be one of the first on the team sheet for me — both at Man City and with England. He’s improved greatly in his time at City. Apart from being a workaholic, he’s now added quality to his game.’ Souness won 54 Scotland caps and enjoyed victory over England once in six attempts in 1985 . Souness poses ahead of Scotland's fixture with Ireland, which they won 1-0 . Souness never harboured any doubts about the quality of Darren Fletcher from a young age and is desperate to see the 30-year-old, who missed 18 months of football battling a serious bowel condition, overcome the bumps in his comeback road for Scotland and Manchester United. Fletcher has faded from starting contention this season, playing only one minute for his club since a second-half substitute appearance for Scotland in Poland last month. ‘It would please me to see Darren playing on Tuesday,’ said Souness. ‘You go back three years and, under Sir Alex Ferguson, he would’ve been the first name on the team sheet — especially in the really big games. ‘He was a proper midfield player and had a bit of everything — great athleticism, aggression, chipped in with not a lot of goals but goals. No one knows how illness will affect you but the fact he’s back playing is encouraging. ‘It might take him another six months, it might take another year. A fit Darren Fletcher gets into any England team, certainly the player that we saw three years ago.’ Graeme Souness was speaking on behalf of 666BET.com ahead of the Scotland v England match at Celtic Park on Tuesday. Among the many bets on offer is the “Glorious ’67” – Money back on losing Scotland first goalscorer bets (up to £20) if Scotland score in the 67th minute.","Souness reckons England can be beaten and they do not excite him .

"Croatia coach Niko Kovac warned on Saturday that the qualifier against Italy will have to be called off if the pitch does not improve. The 2016 European Championship qualifying match is scheduled to kick off on Sunday at 8:45 p.m. (1945 GMT) but Milan has been hit by flash floods and torrential rain, forcing both teams to abandon their planned training sessions at the San Siro. 'If the pitch remains in these conditions, the game can't go ahead,' Kovac said. 'The ball doesn't bounce, it would be like a game of waterpolo.' Croatia boss Niko Kovac (above) has warned that the San Siro pitch must improve after heavy rain and floods . Both teams had to cancel their planned training sessions on the pitch as Milan has been hit by flash floods . Italy and Croatia are level at the top of their group, having won their opening three matches. 'Let's hope the weather improves. For a good match the pitch has to be at its best,' Italy coach Antonio Conte said. Conte has said the match will be a true test of how far Italy has progressed since he took over in July following a dismal World Cup, and Italy captain Gianluigi Buffon agreed. 'Tomorrow will not be a game like any other, because these groups are made up of prestigious teams and minnows,' the goalkeeper said. 'It's clear that this will be one of those matches which lights up interest. We are going into it with a certain curiosity to measure ourselves up against Croatia. 'We have a lot of humility but also a lot of ambition, because we are Italy and our football history speaks for us. We want to impress tomorrow, and convince ourselves as well as the public that the Italian team is still alive and kicking.' Despite Italy's group exit in Brazil, hope is growing that the Azzurri can be realistic title challengers in 2016. Antonio Conte (above) hopes the game is on so his side can show their improvement since the World Cup . Liverpool striker Mario Balotelli (left) is out of the game with strained muscles in his lower back and adductor . 'We have to proceed carefully in every sense, because we're coming off the back of a burning disappointment and we should never forget that disappointment because it will give us extra strength to move forward,' Conte said. 'We're moving forward in steps. We should never lack ambition and we need to show that we have our feet firmly on the ground. We'll qualify first and then in that month try and create a war machine.' Mario Balotelli withdrew from the Italy squad earlier in the day, along with Juventus defender Angelo Ogbonna. Balotelli had been called up for the first time under Conte, despite his poor form, but the Liverpool striker strained his lower back and adductor muscles. 'Mario had this inflammation in the groin and couldn't train,' Conte said. 'So it was useless to keep him with us. Yes, I liked him, like the others I hadn't seen before.'","Milan has been hit by flash floods and torrential rain ahead of the match .

"This was a point celebrated wildly by the 2,600 Wales fans inside the King Baudoiun Stadium. A shirts off, flag-waving party spurred by trance music blaring from the sound system. Gareth Bale went topless too, chucking his yellow jersey into the crowd along with Ashley Williams, Aaron Ramsey and others. Usually such scenes of euphoria are reserved for cup final victories and relegation survivals. Rarely have they been preceded by a 0-0 draw. But it was understandable, Wales had come to the nation ranked fourth in the world, their toughest destination on the road to qualification for Euro 2016, and left with their unbeaten record still intact. Gareth Bale throws his shirt into the crowd after helping Wales earn a 0-0 draw with Belgium in their Euro 2016 qualifier . Wales players huddle together after weathering a Belgium storm to stay top of Group B . Bale and Aaron Ramsey share a joke after maintaining their four-game unbeaten run in qualifying . Belgium 4-2-3-1: Courtois 7; Vanden Borre 6, Lombaerts 7, Alderweireld 7, Vertonghen 7; Witsel 6, Fellaini 5; Chadli 5 (Benteke 62’ 6), De Bruyne 6, Hazard 7; Origi 6 (Mertens 73’ (Januzaj 89’)) Marc Wilmots 6 . Wales 4-4-1-1: Hennessey 7.5; Gunter 6.5, Chester 8.5, A Williams 8, Taylor 6.5; Allen 7.5, Ledley 6, Cotterill 5 (G Williams 46’), Ramsey 5; Robson-Kanu 6 (Huws 90’); Bale 7.5 . Booked: Allen, G Williams, Ledley, Hennessey . Chris Coleman 7 . MoM: Chester . Referee: Pavel Kralovec (Czech Republic) Player ratings from LAURIE WHITWELL in Brussels . It appeared for a fleeting moment at the death like it was being snatched away, when Christian Benteke’s header was saved by Wayne Hennessey and caused havoc in the six-yard area. Axel Witsel got a touch to divert the ball towards the Welsh net but as it rolled Bale, of all people, arrived to clear from danger. That swing of the boot, in the sixth minute of injury time, was just as important as any he has delivered at the other end of the pitch for his country. A star player scrapping it out. The lengthy added time came due to Dries Mertens needing treatment after being knocked out by an accidental collision with George Williams. He left on a stretcher only 16 minutes after coming on. Joe Allen required medical attention earlier in the second half, when Marouane Fellaini led a dangerous forearm into his face in a tussle for the ball. Allen had seemingly irritated the Manchester United midfielder by knocking him down five minutes beforehand. Lucky for Fellaini the only red came from Allen’s lip, which was still bleeding as the Liverpool player boarded the team coach. He played down the incident, as did his manager. It will be sore heads of a different kind this morning for those Welsh fans who crossed the Channel, sunk beer in the bars of Brussels during the day, and continued to do so into the night. It really was an immense release of energy from that section of this great bowl of a ground when the final whistle sounded. The point was secured by totemic defending from captain Ashley Williams and James Chester, who is growing into his role in this team. Time and again the pair of centre-backs weathered Belgian attacks, clearing and heading all that came their way. It was by no means a Belgian onslaught, thanks to Allen’s fine work in midfield, and Bale went close with two free-kicks and a trademark run and shot. Chris Coleman will be pleased, too, about the nous used at certain moments. True, this was not an expansive display but he wants his players to be streetwise when they are unable to show style. ‘It's a fantastic result,’ said Bale. ‘I think we started a bit slow, but in the second half we showed a bit of character and true courage – that’s massive for us. The fans were incredible.’ His clearance? ‘You have to do those things! Everyone will do everything and we all work for each other.’ Wales now have eight points from four games, the kind of ratio that will get Coleman’s side to France and a first major tournament since 1958. Bale had the first chance, in the 14th minute, sizing up a free-kick from 25 yards and striking over the wall. Thibaut Courtois sprang to his left to palm wide. Belgium and Wales's star players - Eden Hazard (L) and Gareth Bale (R) respectively - warm up ahead of the game . Wales supporters lay a patchwork of flags at the King Baudouin Stadium, Brussels . Bale (C) leaps in the air to stretch his muscles as both sides take to the pitch . That sparked Belgium’s best period. Eden Hazard dribbled through three Wales defenders and brought a good save from Hennessey. The Crystal Palace goalkeeper, unwanted by Neil Warnock, made an even better one minutes later, racing from his line to deny Nacer Chadli after Divock Origi’s clever flick set him clear. Nicolas Lombaerts then cracked a shot against the post from a corner and as the ball rebounded it hit Origi and trickled wide. But in the second half Belgium, World Cup quarter-finalists last summer, were subdued for long periods and Wales had the better chances. Bale rekindled memories of his 2010 hat-trick in the San Siro with a run down the left and shot from a tight angle. The ball whistled wide. Hal Robson-Kanu then tested Courtois from range. ‘Belgium have players who can create chances from nothing so we knew we had to ride our luck a little bit,’ said Coleman. ‘But we were stubborn and it was a courageous performance. ‘The momentum is there. That team in 2002 was a hell of a good team, littered with Premier League players. The front three was (John) Hartson, (Craig) Bellamy and (Ryan) Giggs – that's not bad – but we never did it.’ The challenge now for Wales is to make this result worthwhile and give those supporters something seismic to celebrate.

"Marouane Fellaini appeared to land a nasty elbow to the face of Joe Allen during Belgium's Euro 2016 qualifier against Wales on Sunday night. The Manchester United and Belgium midfielder was caught on camera as his elbow collided with the face of his Welsh opponent, before escaping without punishment. The incident, midway through the second half of Belgium's 0-0 draw with Chris Coleman's Wales, resulted in Allen having to temporarily leave the field, his face gushing with blood.

And on the first day of the season, Fellaini appeared to land a blow to the face of Swansea midfielder Ki Sung-yueng; the outcome this time a yellow card to Ki.

"Gareth Bale was always going to be Wales' most dangerous threat going forward but it was the Real Madrid superstar's tenacity at the back that said it all for proud coach Chris Coleman. Forward Bale scrambled to clear a ball from the line at the death as Wales stayed at the top of Group B and maintain their undefeated record so far in Euro 2016 qualifying. 'That epitomises every thing about us at the moment,' said Coleman. 'Baley back there kicking it off the line. Usually we're talking about him at the other end but we all have to put a shift in.'

Bale, left, clears the ball from the line to help Wales finish with a 'fanstastic' draw . As a whole, Coleman said 0-0 was 'an incredible performance from our lads'. 'It wasn't pretty at times but who cares? It's about points,' he said. 'We learnt from the last campaign where we played some much better football, we had a lot of chances, we kept getting beat too much. (It was) Too easy when we didn't have the ball but we're a much tougher outfit now. 'That's two clean sheets in four games. Two clean sheets against the two top teams, Bosnia and Belgium, so we're on the right path, that's for sure.' 'We're up against an incredible offensive, aggressive team, they don't come much tougher than that. It's been labelled the best Belgium team ever so to come here and take a point it speaks volumes for our players. 'The lads, they showed so much character, courageous at times. Bale shows his passion as his Welsh side picked up a point against the world No 4 Belgium . Bale went close with this shot after escaping on his preferred left side . 'That attitude and we've had it for some time now where we're always in the game even if the opposition are on top of us. We don't buckle, we don't duck it and we don't hide from the challenge. We stand our ground.' The man himself, Bale, said his work rate getting forward and back was all part of this Wales team's make up dubbing the draw a 'fantastic' result. 'To get any result was a fantastic performance from us,' Bale said. 'We'll take the point. 'We started a bit slow in the first half but the football we played in the second half we showed true courage, true character and to get a point is massive for us.' 'We put expectation on ourselves more than anyone and we know what we're capable of. 'It was great to get a point, we showed a good performance for the fans.' Manager Chris Coleman (right)  praised the courage of his players as they equalled the Belgians at home . On his own defensive heroics, Bale said: 'You have to do those things. We all work for each other.' Coleman admitted his heart was in his mouth a number of times, as the likes of Chelsea's Eden Hazard consistently threatened but his side showed steel in defence. 'Offensively they're an aggressive team, they don't come much tougher than that,' he said. 'We said we're going to have to ride our luck a bit. Eden Hazard (right) was a constant threat going forward for Belgium . Wales captain Ashley Williams, keeping tight on Nacer Chadli, said a point and a clean sheet is 'massive' '[Wales] showed so much character and were courageous at times. When teams are on top of us we don't buckle.' Captain Ashley Williams hailed the 0-0 finish among the best performances he has ever been involved with in international football. 'One of the best performances I've seen at least in my time with Wales as a team,' he said. 'Everyone really stuck to the cause. It wasn't too pretty in the first half but we dug in. 'To come here and get a point and a clean sheet is massive for us. It keeps our momentum in the group, we haven't lost yet.

"Jan Vertonghen has issued a plea to manager Mauricio Pochettino for more appearances and spoken of his desire to ‘one day play 60 games again’. The Belgian has been in and out of the side this season with club captain Younes Kaboul and new signing Federico Fazio generally preferred at centre-back in the Premier League. Vertonghen has played every minute of Spurs’ Europa League campaign but only started six of their 11 games in the league. One of those came when Fazio was suspended.

Vertonghen, who will captain his country against Wales in the absence of Vincent Kompany, said: 'I want to play every game but this manager, Pochettino, has a different approach, he likes to give everyone the time to play and settle in. 'Hopefully one day I can play 60 games a season again, but at the moment, that is not the case. ‘My season has been ups and downs like Tottenham itself. I started the season with an injury after the World Cup. I came into the team in the second or third game and then I got dropped again.

Kaboul is now fit and he is our captain. They bought Fazio and he is an Argentina international and (Vlad) Chiriches is the Romanian captain.’ Vertonghen also backed Ben Davies, his rival in their Euro 2016 qualifier, to seize the left-back spot at Spurs in future. The summer signing from Swansea has only played 18 minutes in the Premier League this season. 'I played some games with him on a Thursday,’ said Vertonghen, dryly. 'Of course you want to play in the Premier League and he’s a very good player. 'He’s doing very well. But Danny Rose is one of the best left-backs in the Premier League at the moment. Ben is 21 and has the time to improve. 'He's a very good left-back and he can be number one left-back at Spurs one day. 100 per cent that day will come.

"To borrow the words of Robin van Persie, this match was like a ‘poker game’ for Guus Hiddink. The Holland coach had in effect held a gun to his own head, promising to resign after just 72 days at the helm if his team failed to beat Latvia in this European Championship qualifier. But Hiddink knew he had a strong hand and in Robin van Persie, Arjen Robben, Wesley Sneijder and Klaas-Jan Huntelaar, four genuine aces. Arjen Robben grabbed a double to ensure Holland ran out comfortable winners against Latvia .

The quartet ran amok at the Amsterdam ArenA as Holland put their recent troubles to one side with a comfortable win - but it did come at a price for Manchester United. Daley Blind, the midfielder who has performed so consistently well for them this season, hobbled off injured after 20 minutes after colliding with Eduards Visnakovs and taking a blow to the knee. He is now a doubt for Saturday’s trip to Arsenal as Louis van Gaal’s injury nightmare grows ever worse. It will be a threadbare United side that lines up at the Emirates, with Blind’s injury adding to a casualty list that already includes David de Gea, Marcos Rojo, Phil Jones, Jonny Evans and Michael Carrick. His withdrawal didn’t affect Holland too badly, however. At least Van Persie’s early header gave Van Gaal something to smile about and they asserted a clear dominance over their visitors with goals from Robben - a 25-yard worldie - and Huntelaar before the break. Jeffrey Bruma turned in a Van Persie flick-on 12 minutes from time to add some gloss to the scoreline, Robben powered in a fifth and Huntelaar drilled home No 6 in the final minute. More pertinently, this second win in qualifying Group A lifts the pressure on Hiddink, who was on the brink after four defeats in his first five matches since succeeding Van Gaal after the World Cup. The former Chelsea boss can breathe easy, at least until they play Turkey at the end of March. Hiddink shuffled his pack and brought the game-winning cards to the fore. Van Persie, who sat out Wednesday’s match with Mexico, tucked in behind Huntelaar with Robben and Afellay stationed either side of him. Blind started as a defensive shield, asked to curb his natural attacking instincts. Neither the dismal recent form - nor the lousy Amsterdam weather - failed to dampen the spirit of the Oranje fans, who created a right din ahead of kick-off as techno tunes pumped out of the PA system and into the enclosed ArenA. The players responded, attacking with a high tempo from the first whistle. On two minutes, Van Persie controlled the ball inside the box and nudged it wide to Afellay, who curled his shot against the upright. Moments later and they had the lead, settling the nerves of Hiddink and the entire stadium. Robben, as he would be allowed to all evening, found space down the left and placed his cross right on Van Persie’s head for the most straightforward of finishes. In contrast to his patchy recent form for United, this was Van Persie’s 18th goal in 25 national team appearances and his 49th in orange colours overall. Feeling more relaxed, Holland continued to pour forward at will. Robben again collected possession in the right-hand channel, cut inside two defenders, and fired into the side-netting.

On the quarter-hour, Van Persie touched on to Huntelaar - the forward pair combining well as Hiddink had hoped - and the ball wormed its way to Afellay, whose low drive was saved by former Crystal Palace keeper Aleksandrs Kolinko. There was a moment of alarm when Janis Ikaunieks found the unmarked Valerijs Sabala inside the area, but the Latvian headed over when well-placed. The injury to Blind killed Holland’s momentum and their chances dried up until the final 10 minutes of the half. Sneijder, whose 74 successful passes in the opening period eclipsed the 56 of the entire Latvian team, found Van Persie pulling away at the back post but his header was easily saved. It took a moment of wonder from Robben to awaken the game from its slumber. Collecting the ball wide right, he cut inside and curled the ball left-footed and into the top corner from 25 yards. Kolinko gawped at it as it flew past him, unable to influence the perfect trajectory achieved by the Bayern Munich man’s boot. And three minutes from the break, Hiddink could truly rest easy when Huntelaar ghosted in front of his marker and stuck out a foot to turn Afellay’s low cross past Kolinko. It was a fitting reflection of Dutch dominance. It took Holland a good 10 minutes to get back into their stride after half-time, with Van Persie again testing Kolinko with a header from Robben’s flighted free-kick. And the winger curled his next set-piece against the post a couple of minutes later as Holland threatened a fourth, while a shot from an impossibly tight angle following another marauding run was somehow kept out by the goalkeeper. It was, at times, the Robben show and after he’d seen another couple of efforts blocked, his 78th-minute corner was flicked on by Van Persie at the near post and turned in by former Chelsea man Bruma for 4-0. And as if he hadn’t done enough to earn the man of the match accolade, Robben slammed home No 5 as well. Huntelaar rounded off the rout with a neat spin inside the box and a low finish under the keeper. Former Chelsea defender Jeffrey Bruma (right) also managed to get his name on the scoresheet .

"Wayne Rooney was presented with the ‘golden cap’ by fellow England centurion Sir Bobby Charlton at Wembley in front of 80,000 fans on Saturday. With England’s Under-21s side looking impressive in their 3-1 victory over Portugal on Thursday, Sportsmail looks at four players who could follow in Rooney’s footsteps. Saido Berahino . Called up by Roy Hodgson for the Euro 2016 qualifier against Slovenia and friendly against Scotland. Saido Berahino is set to win his first cap next week, but can he emulate the likes of Wayne Rooney? Berahino has been impressive at youth level, and could become the first refugee to play for England . He has scored seven goals in the Premier League for West Bromwich Albion this season, only Alexis Sanchez (8), Diego Costa (10) and Sergio Aguero (12) have scored more. The 21 year-old is also the top-scorer in the Under-21 2015 UEFA Championship qualifying campaign with eight goals. The West Brom academy graduate initially struggled going out on loan to Northampton Town, Brentford and Peterborough United, but since returning to the Black Country the energetic striker has found his feet in the Premier League. The West Brom striker has scored seven times already this season, including against Manchester United . After reported interest from Liverpool West Brom decided to open fresh contract talks with the much sought-after youngster. He only signed a new four-year extension with the club in December 2013. Likely to make his international debut on Tuesday against Scotland at Celtic Park. Harry Kane . Tottenham Hotspurs' most impressive player in a so-far disappointing transition under Mauricio Pochettino. Despite being the joint-top scorer in this season’s Europa League with five goals he has only started one game in the league to the annoyance and bemusement of many of Spurs' fans. Harry Kane has scored six times for the U-21s, and Roy Hodgson has hinted at a full cap not being far away . Kane has been a bright spot during a disappointing start to this season at White Hart Lane . The North London club have lost four out of five home games this season, while Kane has warmed the bench, but his performances in Europe have given the indication that he could be the man to provide the lethal touch that Pochettino and the club badly need. A product of the Spurs’s academy Kane has represented England at every youth level, scoring 6 goals in 9 appearances for the Under-21s, but is yet to make an appearance for the senior side. Danny Ings . Scored 21 goals in the Championship last season as part of Burnley’s promotion to the Premier League subsequently winning 2013-14 Championship Player of the Year. Has scored just once in the Premier League this season, but netted twice in England’s Under-21’s 3-1 win over Portugal on Thursday evening at his home-ground Turf Moor. Danny Ings' form in the last season attracted attention, and he has shown international potential . The 22 year-old former Bournemouth man has four goals in six Under-21 appearances, mainly down to his physical presence in and around the box. Burnley’s next three games against Stoke, Aston Villa and Newcastle could see him improve his top-flight tally. Patrick Bamford . Chelsea’s exciting young prospect has experienced Football League environments for the last three seasons playing on-loan at MK Dons, Derby County and this season for Middlesbrough. Played once for the Republic of Ireland Under-18s, before switching allegiance to play for England. Since 2010 he has playing for the Under-18s, 19s and 21s, making his Under-21 debut in November 2013 as a substitute against San Marino. Patrick Bamford is exceptionally highly thought of at Chelsea, and could be an England star of the future . Bamford once represented the Republic of Ireland at youth level, but is now fully committed to England . In his spells at Derby and now Middlesbrough the young Chelsea striker has shown a killer instinct . Considered by some of Chelsea’s coaching staff to be the next thing, he has certainly impressed with his consistent performances and goalscoring in the Championship and League One.","Wayne Rooney made his England debut at 17 in  2003 against Australia .
Became the ninth England player to reach 100 caps on Saturday .
A quartet of Under-21s strikers could be the future of English football ."
"Former Germany manager Rudi Voller has backed Lukas Podolski to rediscover his best form once he has sorted out his club future. Podolski was a World Cup winner in the summer but has struggled to get a game at Arsenal, and Germany coach Joachim Loew has admitted the situation is jeopardising his place in the national team. The former Cologne and Bayern Munich forward is to thrash out his future with the Gunners this winter with a move away from London looking increasingly likely. Lukas Podolski has made 121 appearances for Germany, scoring 47 goals in the process . Voller does not believe Podolski has played his last game for Germany, though, and expects to see him revitalised in the new year. 'You must not write Poldi off,' he told the Bild am Sonntag newspaper. 'He's not very old yet, at 29. 'Lukas is a very good player who always faces up to the challenge. Competition has got fiercer, but it says a lot that he is still always involved (for Germany). National team boss Joachim Loew warned Podolski he must play at Arsenal if he wants to play for Germany . 'Of course it's an advantage for a player's self-confidence when he is playing regularly, though.' That is something Podolski will be seeking this winter when the transfer window opens with Loew's warning that he will lose his place in the national team enough to convince him to take action. 'I know how to deal with my situation and what Jogi has said,' Podolski said. 'It's just the case that I'm lacking a rhythm and this is down to the fact that I am not playing regularly for my club.' The former Cologne and Bayern Munich man has found his first-team opportunities restricted this season .","Lukas Podolski has struggled for appearances at Arsenal this season .

"Arsenal defender Mathieu Debuchy is hoping to resume full training next month after a frustrating start to his career at the Emirates. The French right back signed from Newcastle United in the summer after 18 months with the Magpies but has been sidelined since suffering an ankle injury in Arsenal’s 2-2 draw with Manchester City in September.

"The greatest talent in the game can rescue a performance with one game-changing flick of their boot on the edge of the area. Raheem Sterling had kept an expectant Wembley audience waiting for 72 minutes for the sweetest of touches to steer the ball into path of Danny Welbeck to score England’s third. It saved the teenager. Until then he had drifted in and out of this game, trying to find his rhythm as this England team lurched between ordinary and average. Raheem Sterling played 85 minutes of England's Euro 2016 qualifier against Slovenia at Wembley . The Liverpool winger proved to be a constant threat for Roy Hodgson's side when he was moved to the wing . Click HERE to read Rob Draper's match report from Wembley . Recalled to the team after complaining of fatigue before last month’s victory over Estonia, he had begun this Euro 2016 qualifier in a tailor-made role at the tip of the diamond. By the time he set up Welbeck’s second against Slovenia, Sterling had been switched to play right midfield. At this stage of his development he looks a far better bet out there. To play off the two main strikers requires a player who will take responsibility for making things happen in the final third of the field. Think Diego Maradona, Zinedine Zidane or Gheorghe Hagi because this is the type of company Sterling is trying to get into. These guys took responsibility for their national teams and everything was channelled through them. Sterling is still young, learning to combine his football at the highest level for club and country. He deserves and needs time. To preserve his talent, to keep this kid fresh, the England forward needs some protection ahead of Tuesday’s blood and thunder friendly in Scotland at Celtic Park. Sterling started the match just behind main strikers Wayne Rooney and Danny Welbeck . The 19-year-old tangles with Slovenia's Jasmin Kurtic as he tries to win back possession for England . Sterling congratulates Rooney after the England captain scores from the spot on his 100th appearance . In the same way that Hodgson rested Calum Chambers, who has already played 19 times for club and country this season, from this Euro 2016 qualifier against Slovenia, he must consider Sterling’s best interests. This clash with Slovenia was his 21st appearance of the season and there is a danger that he will soon be dropping deep into the red zone. It may be that he is there already. We know he has the touches, the ability to pick a ball out of the sky and trap it with either foot for Liverpool and England. His back heel to Welbeck in the 28th minute was the highlight of the first half, a delayed touch that Slovenia’s defence was impossible to read. After the break he did a decent job of chasing down an attempted clearance from the Slovenia defence in the move that led to England’s second goal 66 minutes into this mediocre performance by the national team. Sterling played a major role in Danny Welbeck's second goal of the night . Arsenal midfielder Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain replaced Sterling in the 85th minute . Hodgson’s decision to send him wide was a sensible decision, something the head coach can always fall back on as Sterling continues his football education. There were a couple of loose touches at the start of the half but he, like the rest of this England team, perked up after Jordan Henderson’s 57th minute own goal. When Sterling set up Welbeck’s second from the edge of the Slovenia penalty area with that neat first touch, his work for the night was done. Hodgson sent for Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, replacing the Liverpool forward for the final few minutes of this 3-1 victory against Slovenia. At the final whistle they replayed the move that led to Sterling’s neat touch for Welbeck to score his second of the game on the giant screens behind each goal. It safe to say that no-one will ever tire of watching that.

"Liverpool want a buy-out clause in Raheem Sterling’s next contract to apply only to overseas clubs — so they don’t lose him to a Premier League rival. Sterling, 19, has begun talks with Liverpool over a new long-term deal, with both sides aware of his growing reputation as one of the best young players in Europe. The youngster, who cost £1million when he signed from QPR in 2010 — which now looks a steal — wants a buy-out clause inserted in case Real Madrid or Barcelona come calling. Liverpool do not want to lose England international Raheem Sterling to a Premier League rival . Sterling is now one of the first names on Brendan Rodgers' teamsheet due to his recent fine displays . Liverpool could insert a £55million release clause into Sterling's next contract to warn off potential suitors . Liverpool accept the clause as part of negotiations and a fee of £55m would represent a staggering profit on the player anyway. But they are keen that the figure does not apply to other Premier League clubs to ensure Sterling does not end up at Chelsea or Manchester City. Owner John W Henry was adamant when Luis Suarez wanted to leave in 2013 that he would not be sold to a domestic rival. Arsenal’s bid was rejected but Suarez was allowed to sign for Barcelona last summer. Sterling started in England’s Euro 2016 qualifier on Saturday having been involved in controversy earlier this season when Roy Hodgson revealed he was too tired to start against Estonia.

At the age of 29 the Manchester United striker has time on his side and says his more immediate ambition is to win a World Cup. But the fact that someone of his standing is thinking about working his way through the management ranks is a boost at a time when many recently retired stars prefer the glamour of the TV studio to learning how to be a boss by striving away in the lower Leagues. It reflects Rooney's love for the game, which he said on Friday has not changed since a brief flirtation with boxing when he was aged 14. Rooney, who started his career at Everton before moving to Manchester United in 2004, revealed he was persuaded to stay at Goodison by the club's former boss Colin Harvey. He said: 'Colin Harvey was a massive help because when I was about 14 I stopped enjoying playing football. I had enjoyed it all my life until then, but I was being told to do different things that I didn't want to do and it was down to Colin that I carried on. 'He sat me down and made me fall back in love with it. From that moment on, that's when I said to myself, ""This is what I want to be doing"". 'At that time I was doing boxing as well as football but that's when I stopped going to boxing and focused solely on football. Thankfully it was the right decision.

I felt that it was too much and I remember going home and telling my dad that I didn't want to go any more. 'My dad was upset with me over it. And then I went in to see Colin Harvey and he was great for me. From then, I stopped going to boxing and concentrated 100 per cent on football. From then, that's when the progression was rapid for me. 'He just said he had seen players throughout his career and that he hadn't seen any player with the talent that I had, so I would be making a mistake. He said he would always be there to help me and support me. 'And he said, 'If you keep working hard, then you will be in the first team quicker than you think'. Once he said that, I thought, 'He used to be Everton manager, so he knows the game'. Thank goodness I listened to him.'

He claimed the forward is one of the country's 'greats', adding: 'His technical and tactical qualities are a given. 'But it also takes a lot of mental strength to be an England player. You have to be prepared for periods when you're under severe scrutiny. 'You have to have a great passion for playing for your country as well. When you've played a lot of games and the criticism is coming at you, there must be a moment when you wonder whether you need all this. So you have to have that passion.

"Craven Cottage has surely never witnessed an eruption anything like that which followed Colombia's winner against the USA. They had been whipped into a frenzy by the performance of James Rodriguez and dominated the match, but had to wait until late on to steal it. Teofilo Gutierrez headed in Edwin Cardona's cross in the 87th minute as they came from a goal down and the stadium crammed with Colombia fans exploded.

Referee: Szymon Marciniak (Poland) For the whole match they had reacted insanely to Rodriguez's every movement. They were undeterred even when America took the lead in the 10th minute through Jozy Altidore's penalty. The Sunderland striker took a slow run-up and calmly struck the spot kick down the middle after Colombia's Pablo Armero had handled in the box. Ahead of kick off a red double-decker London bus was completely taken over by Colombian fans, partying their way down the Fulham Place Road. Closer to Craven Cottage, Stevenage Road running along the outside of the ground was crammed with yellow, well before the turnstiles were opened. The mere appearance of Real Madrid's Rodriguez – who was their star and one of the players of the World Cup – and the stadium was akin to a secondary girls school assembly being paid a surprise visit by One Direction. Even when he did barely anything, the decibel levels rose. At one point in the first half, he crossed the ball from the right-hand side. It wasn't a particularly special cross and Carlos Bacca's header was even less spectacular, sailing well over the bar, but the Colombian crowd reacted as if they had just witnessed the winner in a World Cup final. Two minutes later he actually produced a moment worthy of cheer, when he sent a free kick from just outside the box on the left fizzing low towards the far right corner with his left-foot and inches wide of the post. Yet the closest the Colombian's came to scoring before the break did not involve Rodriguez at all. On 33 minutes, Teofilo Gutierrez swiftly broke down the right and passed into Bacca who hit a first-time shot which crashed off the outside of the near right post.

In first-half stoppage time, when Colombia had a shout for a penalty after a shot clearly struck Jermaine Jones' hand, Polish referee Szymon Marciniak gave nothing and the low, collective murmur of discontent from the crowd must've set his spine shuddering. The Americans had been dominated for the majority of the first half, but they came out in the second and carved out one of the best chances of the match within minutes. Alejandro Bedoya crossed into the box and Rubin got in front of his man, dove at the ball and headed narrowly wide from close range.

But, to remind the Colombians why they were there – as if they needed reminding – Rodriguez was in action again moments later, sending a free kick curving towards the far top left corner which Brad Guzan had to push over. The supporters worked up into a frenzy. A little later he controlled the ball with his chest and slipped over. There was a similar reaction. Then the equaliser came, just after the hour mark. And it involved that man, of course. Rodriguez played a delicate through ball into the path of Bacca who had made an angled run into the box, rounded Guzan and scored. The reaction to that goal was something special – but it was eclipsed when they finally came up with the late winner.","Real Madrid midfielder James Rodriguez starred for Colombia as they came from behind to win .

Stan Wawrinka celebrates winning the first set against Roger Federer in the ATP World Tour final . Wawrinka raced into an early lead, winning the first set 6-4 against his compatriot . World No 4 Wawrinka came into the last-four encounter with just two wins against 33-year-old Federer in their 16 meetings but it was the former who landed the first blow as Federer dropped serve for the first time this week in the third game. A fierce forehand return earned Wawrinka a double break for 5-2 and although he initially failed to serve out the opening set against the world No 2, he made no mistake the second time in front of watching Real Madrid footballer James Rodriguez. Proceedings remained tight throughout the second set with Wawrinka saving three break points at 2-3 but he faltered when serving to stay in the set, netting what should have been a simple overhead smash and Federer levelled the match.

Federer made the worst possible start to the final set as he failed to hear an overrule from umpire Cedric Mourier which went against him in the first point and was not a happy man upon discovering he was 0-40 down moments later. Federer then sailed a forehand long to concede the break and continued to mutter away to Mourier about his overrule, which was shown by television to be incorrect, before Wawrinka repeatedly unleashed his powerful groundstrokes to stay in front. Wawrinka saved two break points on serve at 4-3 but faltered when serving for the match as his serve-and-volley tactic on all three of his match points proved unsuccessful and Federer had the crowd on their feet as he broke back for 5-5. Both players then held to take it to a deciding tiebreak and it was Wawrinka who had another chance to seal victory at 6-5 but his return went long and Federer completed the comeback on his first match point with a drop volley which Wawrinka could not reach. Federer and Wawrinka will reunite next week in Lille where the pair will bid to claim victory for Switzerland against France in the Davis Cup final.

"Javier Hernandez wants to stay at Real Madrid when his loan deal expires at the end of the season, admitting he has always dreamed of playing for the La Liga giants. Hernandez fell out of favour at Manchester United last season, only starting six Premier League matches, and believes his Old Trafford career is over. 'They thought I couldn't help any more at United so we decided by mutual agreement that I would leave,' Hernandez told ESPN Deportes. 'It was difficult, although I had offers from other teams, but when I got the opportunity to come to Real Madrid I didn't hesitate.' Javier Hernandez has scored four goals since joining Real Madrid on loan on September 1 . Hernandez was at Man United during a successful period, pictured (right) lifting the Premier League trophy . Hernandez is happy wearing the famous white shirt of Real Madrid, and wants to stay longer than this season . Fairly used to a bit-part role, the Mexican striker has only started one league match for Carlo Ancelotti's side, but admits he knew that would be the case when he joined them on transfer deadline day in September. 'It was the toughest challenge [I was offered] and the one that gave me the least chances [of first-team football], but these are the challenges I like and the ones I've worked for all my life. 'I dreamed of being here. I have the talent and I'll work hard to show I belong at such a great institution. I hope some positive things happen, both to the club and myself.'

"Colombia striker Radamel Falcao is a world class player who will soon rediscover his best form for Manchester United and his country, according to his international coach Jose Pekerman. Falcao, on loan from Monaco, has seen only limited action so far in England  under new manager Louis van Gaal, who has rebuilt the team with several new signings since taking over. The 28-year-old is missing from Colombia's squad, who are in London to play a friendly against the United States at Craven Cottage on Friday, due to injury. Radamel Falcao appeared to be icing up his knee (circled) in this picture posted after Man United beat Everton . Falcao's permanent move to Manchester United is in doubt after fears over his on-going knee problem . When speaking on Thursday, Pekerman said the early season is often hard for players who may be adjusting to new a club, coming back from a long injury absence as in Falcao's case or having had a short pre-season due to playing at the World Cup finals. Matches: 5 . Starts: 3 . Completed matches: 0 . Minutes played: 251 . Goals: 1 . 'This is a new stage for him and for the (Manchester United) team, needing time to adapt to numerous signings, playing in a new competition (like the Premier League),' Pekerman told a news conference at the team's Heathrow hotel. He added: 'Falcao is a top player, I'm optimistic he will overcome this stage and soon be at his level.' Pekerman, preparing his team for the Copa America in Chile next year where Colombia will be looking to win the trophy for the second time, said such FIFA dates when national teams can come together for training and friendlies were essential. 'The high point of these meetings is the work on the field but there is also the chance for tactical talks, video analysis, going over objectives. 'We live these days intensely as part of our preparation searching for a better future.' The 28-year-old celebrates scoring for Colombia against Belgium last November . Falcao's only goal for the club came against Roberto Martinez's Everton at the beginning of October . Pekerman, who steered Colombia to the World Cup quarter-final in Brazil in July, praised the present generation of players for their commitment to their national team and their efforts to lift their standing on the international stage. 'Thanks to these players, people in Colombia can see their team at the big events, compete as equals with other teams, show off the genes and quality of the Colombian player.' Colombia had missed the previous three World Cup tournaments after a former golden generation had reached three in succession in the 1990s. Referring to Friday's opponents, Pekerman added: 'They had a very good World Cup. They are a team with an aggressive and intense game, this is a very good test for us... an experience for our new players.'","Radamel Falcao has scored just once for Manchester United since joining the club on transfer deadline day .

"World Cup-winning defender Gerard Pique looks set to snub a move to the Premier League after revealing he has no intention of leaving Barcelona.
