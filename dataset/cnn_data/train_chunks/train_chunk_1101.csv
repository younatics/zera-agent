"Derry Mathews will challenge world lightweight champion Richar Abril in Liverpool on March 6. Abril, who holds the WBA title, was due to face Anthony Crolla later this month but the Manchester fighter was attacked just before Christmas after interrupting a robbery. As a result, Mathews, who beat Crolla in 2012, will step in for his first shot at a world title against the tricky Cuban. Derry Mathews (right) will get a shot at the WBA world lightweight title in his hometown Liverpool . Abril (left) successfully defends his WBA lightweight title against Edis Tatli in Helsinki last September . The 31-year-old from Liverpool is a former British and Commonwealth champion and has won four of his last five fights but will start as the underdog against Abril. The champion fought just once in both 2013, when he won the title against Sharif Bogere, and last year when he won a majority decision against Edis Tatli in Finland. His sole outing in 2012 saw him lose a split decision to Brandon Rios. A source confirmed to Sportsmail that an official announcement will be made this week. Mathews will be joined on the card at the Echo Arena by Paul Butler who will attempt to win his second world title. Anthony Crolla (right) was forced to withdraw from the fight after being attacked by robbers . Crolla has returned home after a fractured skull and broken ankle was caused when confronting burglars .

Butler takes on IBF super-featherweight champion Zolani Tete in what will be the South African’s first defence. Butler, 26, previously moved up to bantamweight to take on then world champion Stuart Hall, winning by split decision in Newcastle. ‘It’s going to be a magical night at the Echo Arena with my fans backing me all the way to a second world title,’ he said. ‘It’s by no means going to be an easy night against Tete, who’s a very tough and experienced champion, but fighting for the world title in front of my fans at home means the world to me and that will give me the extra determination to win it.’ Paul Butler (left) will attempt to win his second world title against  IBF super-featherweight cham Zolani Tete .","Richar Abril was due to fight Anthony Crolla for WBA lightweight title .

"Derry Mathews has promised to make the first defence of his world title against Anthony Crolla - if he can first dethrone Richar Abril. Mathews will take on the WBA lightweight champion in Liverpool on March 6 after Crolla's own shot at the title was wrecked when he suffered a fractured skull and broken ankle after interrupting a robbery.

'Whereas other fighters from the city have had to go overseas for their chances, Frank [Warren] has got me mine on my own door step and now it’s down to me to deliver the goods on my side and win the title. 'I’m not underestimating Abril one bit, he’s the world champion, but I’m confident in my own abilities and I believe that I have the tools to end Abril’ s reign and take the world title from him.

'I really felt for Anthony, yes we’re sporting rivals, but that was terrible what happened and I was truly gutted for him.

'He missed out on his shot at Abril because of what happened, but should I come through against Abril and win, then I will give him a shot at the world title. A third fight between us is a natural and would be a fantastic battle of Britain.' Champion Abril has only fought once a year in the last three years, making a single defence of his title . The Cuban-born boxer raises his hands after defeating challenger Edis Tatli in September 2014 . Abril, who is based in Miami having defected from Cuba, has only fought once in each of the last three years but has won 19 of his 23 fights. He won his title with a points win over Sharif Bogere in 2013 and made one defence last year against Edis Tatli in Finland. Abril said: 'I’m looking forward to defending my title against Derry Mathews. He is a tough, experienced, fighter, but I plan on coming to the UK, getting the KO and leaving with my belt.'","Derry Mathews takes on Richar Abril for WBA lightweight title on March 6 .

"West Bromwich Albion are willing to listen to offers for club record signing Brown Ideye, who Tony Pulis says 'has a cloud hanging over him at the moment'. Ideye missed a glorious chance against Hull to justify some of his £10million fee and has looked bereft of confidence since joining from Dynamo Kiev. Pulis is determined to bring in a striker to share the goal burden on Saido Berahino this transfer window, and Ideye could leave to raise funds. Brown Ideye (front), pictured in action against Hull City, could be sold by West Brom this month . The striker has scored just two goals since arriving from Dynamo Kiev for a club record £10million . 'I can't say he's staying,' said Pulis. 'If someone comes in and offers an enormous amount of money the club looks at it. That's the same with every player. Every club I've been at has worked that way. 'If something comes on the table you sit down and look at it, take a view of whether it's right for the club or not. That will be the same with Brown.' Ideye has scored just twice since his move last summer, a tap-in from two yards in the Capital One Cup and a ball deflecting off the back of his head late on against Manchester City. The West Brom head coach added: 'He needs a goal. He can't buy a goal at the moment. But you have a look at what he did (against Hull), the effort and commitment he put in, the way he worked for the team. Baggies boss Tony Pulis has admitted that the club will listen to offers for Ideye in January . Ideye reacts after missing an excellent chance to score against Hull at the Hawthorns last weekend . 'He worked very hard and linked play well at times. He's just a little bit disappointed he hasn't scored. If he'd have taken that chance you would have seen a different player. 'He's got a cloud hanging over him at the moment. If we can lift that cloud and release him a little bit. English football, especially the Premier League, is different to football on the continent. 'It takes a while to get used to. I'm not just talking about Brown, lots of players. You have to give them time and assurance if they keep working hard it will come for them.'","Brown Ideye has struggled since his £10million move to West Brom .

"Premier League footballer Ravel Morrison has been cleared of all charges of assaulting his ex-girlfriend and her mother. The 21-year-old, currently with West Ham United, was accused of hitting his ex Reah Mansoor, 19, and her mother, Parveen Mansoor, 39, after a night out at a nightclub in his home city of Manchester last July 24. He was due to go on trial at Manchester Crown Court later this month but on Thursday the charges were dropped by the prosecution and Morrison, who was not in court, was found not guilty. Ravel Morrison looks set to leave West Ham after failing to break into Sam Allardyce's first-team plans . Morrison, pictured arriving at Manchester Magistrates Court last year, has been cleared of all charges . Guy Mathieson, prosecuting, told the court the charges had been withdrawn after Morrison's defence team recovered CCTV footage of the first alleged assault outside the One Central nightclub, in Manchester city centre. It showed that Morrison had not hit his ex, as was alleged, and she had 'slumped' to the floor on her own. The ex-girlfriend also withdrew her statement alleging Morrison later assaulted her outside her home when he dropped her off and there was 'reluctance' from her mother to proceed with the alleged assault on her. All three charges of assault were withdrawn. Morrison had also been initially accused of threatening to throw acid in the face of his ex and have her shot during a four-year period of harassment. The 21-year-old walks away from court in November after having charges dropped against him . But at a hearing last November the harassment charge was also withdrawn by the prosecution and he was found not guilty on those charges. Morrison is currently back with West Ham after a loan spell with Cardiff. He has been linked with a move to Italian side Lazio. He was first arrested last August after it was alleged that, during a night out, he assaulted his ex and, after 'bundling' her into his Porsche Panamera car, took her home to her mother's house in Salford. When they got back to the house, he is alleged to have assaulted Miss Mansoor again, as well as her mother. But Mr Mathieson said Morrison's lawyers had got the CCTV footage from an office building which captured the alleged first assault. Italian side Lazio want to sign West Ham midfielder Ravel Morrison on a pre-contract for the summer . He said that, in her statement, Miss Mansoor said she remembered her boyfriend standing in front of her and then waking up on the floor with him standing over her. Mr Mathieson continued: 'When reviewing the CCTV footage, it's clear there's a gap she doesn't remember between those two statements. 'She's seen falling, or slumping to the ground, remaining there for a minute or two before, quite clearly, the defendant and her friend come to her assistance, trying to get her to stand up. 'And it is right, thereafter, the Porsche Panamera, the defendant's car, is seen to come, she's put, bundled or half-carried into the car and she's then taken home. 'It's quite clear from that CCTV footage there's no assault at that stage. 'The Crown have to accept there's a gap in the evidence and the Crown is in the position where they have to reconsider the prospect of a conviction and offer no evidence in respect of count one.'","The West Ham midfielder has been cleared of all charges of assaulting his ex-girlfriend and mother .

"If Arsenal fans at the Etihad Stadium on Sunday want a reminder of why they do not compete for titles any more they need only cast a glimpse at the home side's dugout. Because sat there, barring a surprise selection from Manuel Pellegrini, will be a living, breathing symbol of their club's fall from heavyweights to makeweights. Warming himself against the Manchester cold, Bacary Sagna will probably be spending another 90 minutes kicking his heels as the immovable Pablo Zabaleta goes about his business. Bacary Sagna moved to Manchester City from Arsenal on a free transfer last summer . Sagna (centre) has largely found himself sat on the City bench, like here again CSKA Moscow in October . The Frenchman (left), playing for Arsenal, attempts to tackle former City player Carlos Tevez in January 2013 . At this stage last season Sagna, regarded as one of the finest full backs in the country, had played 26 times for the Gunners. This year he has featured in 11 matches for Manchester City, which include just five starts in the Premier League - almost as many appearances at the Etihad as his wife, Ludivine, has made judging by her Twitter and Instagram accounts. From ever-present to ever-ready. Will he be surprised? He should not be. Will he be upset? Who knows? Sagna's wife, Ludivine, has made almost as many appearances at the Etihad this season as the Frenchman . Ludivine Sagna (second left) posted this picture of herself with friends at the Etihad earlier this season . Bacary and Ludivine Sagna enjoy a day on the beach during the World Cup in Brazil last summer . If he is ever feeling down he need only take a look at his monthly salary and the position of his team in the table. Money talks in football and City have more of it than Arsenal. When he completed his move, Sagna slammed those who claimed it was only for the cash before pointing out that, by the way, he hadn't had a pay rise at the Emirates in six years. Figure that one out. 'I need a boost in my career,' he said. Some boost. City were happy to offer a 31-year-old a three-year contract of a reported £150,000-a-week. Arsenal were not. Sagna (left) heads the ball clear during City's FA Cup third-round victory over Sheffield Wednesday . Sagna holds his shirt over his face in dejection during Arsenal's match at Stoke City in March 2014 . That is one of the reasons why Pellegrini's side are vying with Chelsea for the title and why Arsene Wenger's men, once again, will be content with a top-four spot. It may not all be about the money. Sagna will know that if he can muster 10 appearances in the Premier League he will be in with a chance of picking up a winners' medal. Zabaleta has had his injury issues in the past but the warrior-like defender, who turned 30 this week, appears to be in fine nick. As for the Champions League, it is an even grimmer situation. The arrival of Wilfried Bony means that one of City's registered players is going to have to make way and the smart money is on Sagna. The Frenchman (right) tackles Claude Dielna of Sheffield Wednesday on January 4 . Sagna (right) celebrates with Olivier Giroud after scoring for Arsenal against Stoke City in September 2013 . A sad, sad state of affairs. Lest we forget Sagna is not the first. Following the arrival of Sheikh Mansour, Emmanuel Adebayor forged a path north. It soon became well-trodden, with Kolo Toure, Gael Clichy and Samir Nasri following his lead. City know that to succeed at the highest level, you have to spend and spend big. Pellegrini, before he had even started in England, knew that to sustain a serious title challenge he needed two quality players vying for each position. Does Wenger, closing in on 18 years on these shores, agree? If he does he has a funny way of showing it. Sagna lifts the FA Cup trophy above his head after Arsenal's triumph at Wembley last May . Nobody should deny Wenger's achievements and what he has done for the club. Winning with guile soon became winning with style. They should name the stadium his dealings pretty much paid for after him and cast the bronze for his statue. Maybe Wenger will master his own French revolution. While splashing the cash on Mesut Ozil was a start, Alexis Sanchez has been a revelation. And nobody could predict that Sagna's replacement, Mathieu Debuchy, would be out for three months, come back for one game and then get injured and be out for another three months. But the weak points go beyond right back and, while he may yet prove people wrong this window, the manager appears to be too stubborn to address them. Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger celebrates by grabbing Sagna's head and embracing him after the FA Cup final . Fans scream for a central defender and on Friday he goes out and pays £4.2million for a 17-year-old Polish midfielder with six appearances under his belt. Last season, when they came to Manchester top of the league, City hit them for six. Are Arsenal any better this time around? At some point during proceedings there is little doubt the Etihad faithful will launch into a chant reminding the visitors that they are now their feeder club. While it will be sung with Mancunian tongues planted firmly in cheeks, the sad fact of the matter is that they are not far wrong.

"Dave King launched his move to oust the entire Rangers board by formally submitting a demand for a General Meeting on Friday night. As hundreds of fans gathered outside Ibrox in protest at plans to mortgage off Ibrox and Murray in return for a £10million loan from Mike Ashley, the South African-based businessman insisted he is confident of gaining the 51 per cent backing required to remove chairman David Somers, chief executive Derek Llambias, finance director Barry Leach and non-executive director James Easdale. King, the largest single shareholder at the club, proposes that he is elected onto the board in their places alongside fellow former club director Paul Murray and John Gilligan, a one-time managing director of Tennent Caledonian Brewers. Dave King has called a general meeting to ask Rangers shareholders to rout the entire Ibrox board . Rangers fans protest before Friday's match with Hearts over claims that Ibrox is to be mortgaged off . The Rangers board considered mortgaging off Ibrox  in return for a £10million loan from Mike Ashley . Llambias and Leach would, initially, retain their executive roles — but be off the board — before new appointments were made. The notice seeking the General Meeting was hand delivered to Ibrox on Friday night, the day after it emerged that advance notices of security over the stadium and Murray Park had been lodged at the Reigstry of Scotland on behalf of Ashley’s Sports Direct firm. The move has been viewed as a precursor to the board accepting Ashley’s loan ahead of a rival funding offer from a Douglas Park-led group. George Letham, one of Park’s associates, visited Ibrox on Friday for talks after the consortium pledged to up their initial £5m proposal in a bid to block Ashley. Rangers defender Darren McGregor (right) tackles Hearts' Sam Nicholson on a snowy night at Ibrox . Rangers fans gesture towards Hearts' supporters as a board explains why the game had to be cancelled . Park, Letham and George Taylor have around 19 per cent between them, while King has 15 per cent. Approximately 11 per cent is owned by fans with the likes of Walter Smith, Ally McCoist and recent investor Felix Magath holding another three per cent, which would give a total of around 48 per cent. King firmly believes he will gain sufficient further backing to cross the line and seize control at a meeting which will take place within the next six weeks. ‘The requisition consists of four resolutions for the removal of the incumbent board and three resolutions for the appointment to the board of myself, Paul Murray and John Gilligan,’ said King. ‘The resolutions do not seek to review the employment of the two executive directors presently on the board. They will merely be removed as directors. Police and stewards hold people back as Hearts and Rangers fans attempt to confront each other . ‘I would not have called for a General Meeting if I was not confident, from my review of the present shareholder register, that it will be supported by more than 50 per cent of the total registered shareholders. ‘While many of the shareholders hold differing views as to what is right for the club, I believe that a clear majority are like-minded on one key point — the need to remove the incumbent board and to replace it with individuals who can gain the trust of fans, sponsors and the shareholder community.’ King’s own planned position on the board could be subject to scrutiny by the SFA given his previous issues with the tax authorities in South Africa, although he has previously insisted he sees no issue in meeting ‘fit and proper person’ requirements. The Castlemilk-born tycoon — who lost a £20m Rangers investment made during Sir David Murray’s tenure — would seek to expand the board if successful at the General Meeting, which could lead to representation from within the Park consortium. King wants an in-depth study of the commercial contracts and pledged to pursue any instances where it is deemed they are not in the club’s best interests. He would also seek a new nominated advisor (NOMAD) in the City of London to replace WH Ireland as part of an overhaul. Rangers went into administration in February 2012 and were later relegated to the Scottish Third Division . ‘It is also desirable to partner a NOMAD that is willing to move forward and away from the recent poor governance at the club,’ added King. ‘I have already had initial discussions with potential NOMADs on the basis of two key conditions. Firstly, that the resolutions at the AGM are passed. Secondly, that the board is expanded as soon as possible thereafter to incorporate experienced independent non-executive directors such that the highest level of corporate governance is achieved and maintained. ‘That is exactly what all stakeholders should want to happen after experiencing so many years of different boards that have lurched from one crisis to another. In advance of the General Meeting I will further engage with NOMADs willing to embrace the standards that we will set for the future and ensure that an appropriate arrangement is in place to be adopted immediately on conclusion of a successful vote at the General Meeting. ‘The most pressing task for the incoming board will be to ensure the long-term financial sustainability of the club. A secondary important task will be to conduct a forensic audit of the management and commercial contracts undertaken over the last few years to determine whether they are truly arms length and whether the affairs of the company have been pursued in accordance with the fiduciary obligations of those entrusted with that responsibility. Any malfeasance will be pursued aggressively and transparently.","Dave King will call for the head of David Somers at general meeting .

"The Three Bears told the Rangers board they would stump up whatever was required to prevent Ibrox being used as security on a loan to Mike Ashley. The Douglas Park-led group also revealed how their bid to secure a guarantee for the stadium was recently kicked out by the powerbrokers – giving rise to the ‘abhorrent’ notion that it will now be mortgaged. The prospect of the Newcastle owner getting the title deeds to the stadium moved into clear view when his company served notice of its intention to use it as collateral on a £10million loan. Ashley, who has already loaned the club £3m, plans to extend its credit facility with him by using its prized asset and the Murray Park training complex as security. Mike Ashley has filed documents notifying land register bosses that he plans to take out security on Ibrox . News of the development – emerging from documents filed with the Registers of Scotland - was met with widespread anger by fans groups – with many highlighting the fact the board had repeatedly stated their famous ground was sacrosanct. Now the Rangers Supporters Trust are set to attend the Court of Session today in a bid to have an interim interdict granted against security over Ibrox being issued. The development could also force a push for drastic boardroom changes via an EGM but, as of the close of Stock Market business yesterday, Dave King, the man thought most likely to call one, had not done so. The Ibrox board had been negotiating with the Park-led consortium – knows as the Three Bears – to address its drastic cash shortage. The future of Rangers remains uncertain due to the club's drastic financial situation . That faction, which owns circa 20 per cent of the club, had been seeking two boardroom seats in return for a £5m investment. This would be transferred into equity through a forthcoming share issue. Those negotiations have been fruitless, however, as Ashley’s move means no other group can use Ibrox or Murray Park as security for 35 days. It’s believed the Park group had earmarked Murray Park for their purposes. Last night the three – Park, George Letham and George Taylor – responded to Ashley’s move by insisting they’d gladly up their level of investment if it meant keeping Ibrox out of his clutches. Furthermore, they revealed a request to keep Ibrox free of any security during the talks was flatly rejected. A consortium spokesman said: ‘If we are to believe the BBC report then the Board may be suffering from a bout of amnesia. ‘A £5m funding package was offered by us after discussions with Board members regarding the amount required by the club. If the Board are now saying they need more than £5m then we are prepared to increase our funding package to begin the process of putting Rangers back on a firm financial footing. ‘We hope this can be agreed soon so we can put an end to the suffering of Rangers fans who have been shown complete disregard for far too long. Newcastle owner Ashley is not yet ready to give up his grip on power at Rangers . ‘Rangers supporters deserve greater respect and it would be foolish to take them for granted. They have had enough and will not take any more. ‘Our initial funding offer also asked for a negative pledge on Ibrox, which is a guarantee that security over that asset couldn’t be given to anyone else. ‘This condition was refused by the Board and we accepted this on the basis of the Board’s previous statements that Ibrox would be sacrosanct. ‘Rangers fans, including ourselves, do not want Ibrox given over as security to anyone. The very notion is abhorrent to us and that it is even being considered suggests at best a lack of understanding of what Ibrox rep-resents and at worst a callous disrespect. ‘There is absolutely no need for Ibrox to be used as security when there are people ready and committed to offer more than adequate funding while at the same time protecting the stadium.’ Confirming moves were afoot to grant security over the stadium, a Rangers statement to the Stock Exchange read: ‘The directors confirm that they are currently consider-ing various proposals to secure the financial future of the club, however no decision has been made at this time.’ However, fans fear their club could be in thrall to Ashley for years to come were he to take possession of the title deeds to the stadium in the event of a default on the loan. The Rangers Supporters Trust said they were ‘taking urgent legal advice regarding this attempt by the board of Rangers Football Club to pass the most prized assets of the club to Mike Ashley’. The Ibrox club have turned down a £20million bid by US financier Robert Sarver . ‘We believe the board may be acting illegally on two fronts and we will be working with any other shareholder who wishes to challenge this. If necessary we will instigate legal action against the directors both collectively and individually. ‘We have also contacted several MPs and will be seeking political and government support to stop this attempted asset grab.’ The Union of Fans accused the board of lying to fans, while imploring a boycott of tonight’s crucial match with Hearts. Fan ownership group Rangers First also went public with its dismay at the latest development. It remains to be seen whether anything can be done to prevent Ashley taking security of Ibrox. Although King could yet call an EGM which may see Derek Llambias and Barry Leach deposed, that could take up to 42 days to stage. In theory, the board could solve the cash crisis with a combination of Ashley’s money and some of the £5m tabled by the Three Bears. But the Bears’ insistence on having two places – most likely at the expense of Llambias and Leach makes that seem highly unlikely. Last night, Sale Sharks owner Brian Kennedy, whose £3m rescue package was rejected in favour of Ashley’s, called on him to allay fans’ fears by publicly stating his intentions for Ibrox. ‘We’ve got to be rational,’ he said. ‘It’s very easy to take a kick at Mike Ashley but the bottom line here is that, if the club doesn’t get funds immediately, it will go into administration. ‘I can understand why Ashley’s offer is secured against Ibrox because I wanted to do the same thing when I offered the club money in November. ‘The key difference was my offer was conditional upon Ibrox being placed in a trust. ‘If Ashley was prepared to make such a pledge perhaps there would not be such feelings of anxiety and hysteria among the Rangers fans. They are being treated with absolute contempt.’","Mike Ashley plans to use Ibrox and and Murray Park training complex as security on £10m loan .

"When he was coming through the ranks at Manchester United, staff at their Carrington training base talked in hushed tones about having found the next Paul Scholes. With electrifying feet, surging pace and an eye for the outrageous, Ravel Morrison had it all. These were staff who had seen them all. Ryan Giggs, Scholes, Eric Cantona and the like - but still the Wythenshawe-born starlet raised eyebrows. Ravel Morrison looks set to leave West Ham after failing to break into Sam Allardyce's first-team plans . The 21-year-old has been loaned out to QPR, Birmingham and Cardiff during his time at the Hammers . Harry Redknapp said he was considering bringing Morrison back to QPR as he was 'his last chance' Age: 21 . Born: Wythenshawe, Manchester . Position: Midfielder . Clubs: Manchester United (2010-12), West Ham United (2012-), Birmingham City (loan, 2012-13), Queens Park Rangers (loan, 2014), Cardiff City (loan, 2014) Career appearances: 81 . Career goals: 14 . From early on his behaviour away from the pitch, however, was rumoured to be as colourful as his performances on it. Throughout secondary school, teachers at St Anthony's Catholic College, a 10-minute drive from Old Trafford where Tyler Blackett also studied, had already grown exasperated with him. Concerns were raised that the gifted teenager was hanging with the wrong crowd, older boys who were no strangers to Greater Manchester Police. Those fears were confirmed when, at 16 (and after Sir Alex Ferguson had described him as 'the best talent I've ever seen'), he was in a car stopped in a drugs and guns bust in nearby Whalley Range. By that time he had also picked up a caution for assaulting his mother. Still, stirred by his ability, United tried to make it work. Coaches spent hours trying to put him on the straight and narrow – at one point there were even suggestions he had moved in with a senior first-team player. Morrison was part of the Manchester United side which won the FA Youth Cup in 2011 . They thought his talent made it worth it. But with every tricky sidestep forward came two back. In May 2011, shortly after Morrison scored twice in an electrifying performance as United's youngsters won the FA Youth Cup, he was fined £600 for throwing a girlfriend's phone out of a window during an argument. That episode came after he narrowly avoided jail for witness intimidation and, amid rumours his agent had asked for a bumper new contract, Sir Alex had finally reached the end of his tether. The Scot, however, would also not give up on him. With some sympathy for a less than ideal upbringing he thought that if he could get Morrison away from Manchester he might have a chance. A call was made to old friend Sam Allardyce. 'Fergie told me about his talent and that was it,' Allardyce explained after paying £650,000. 'That’s enough for me. He said: ""If you can sort this lad out, Sam, you’ll have one of the best players you’ve ever had"". I don’t need anything more than that do I?' Big Sam, who immediately admired Morrison's raw talent, believed he needed regular first-team football and sent him to Championship outfit Birmingham City. But problems followed him back up the M6. Shocked at his attitude to training, manager Lee Clark considered cutting the loan spell short but decided not to and was rewarded with a string of stunning displays. Morrison, pictured arriving at Manchester Magistrates Court last year, has been in bother away from the pitch . Nathan Redmond had to intervene when team-mates Morrison and Wilfried Zaha were involved in a bust-up . Enthused by his revival in the Midlands, Allardyce believed the troubled youngster was at last maturing. When he waltzed through the Spurs defence to seal a 3-0 win at White Hart Lane the world sat up and noticed. Allardyce called it 'genius'. Not long after, Roy Hodgson spoke of his admiration. There was even talk of a seat on the plane to Brazil, further fuelled when a clip of THAT goal in an England Under 21s training session went viral. Fulham, whose then manager Rene Meulensteen knew him from his United days, offered £4m and were told in no uncertain terms where to go. But again things soured. Form dipped, and with a relegation battle on his hands Allardyce sent Morrison across London and down a division to promotion-chasing QPR. QPR went up, but it spoke volumes that in the play-off final Harry Redknapp left him on the bench. The Englishman scored a terrific solo goal in West Ham's 3-0 win against Tottenham in October 2013 . That summer, as footballers partied in bars, Morrison was behind them at Strangeways Prison after being charged with two counts of common assault on an ex-girlfriend and her mother. Bailed and back at West Ham, Allardyce was not happy. 'It's not that he has to impress me as a footballer, we know about his talent,' he said. His success, he added, was a question of him leading a 'disciplined life'. Cardiff City was the next loan stop. In November, Morrison was cleared of any wrongdoing for an alleged harassment of his ex over four years but will face trial for the alleged summer assaults in January. In South Wales, after seven appearances with no goals, Russell Slade joined the list of frustrated managers. For Allardyce, now eyeing Europe, enough was enough. It has now got to the stage where the Hammers are willing to cut their losses and let a 21-year-old, who has an £18m release clause in his contract, go for free. Morrison is congratulated by his West Ham team-mates after scoring at White Hart Lane . He is currently in dispute with the club over wages after a fine for misconduct and any chance of a reconciliation appears to have passed. ‘It’s very difficult to sit and watch such a great talent wasted,' said Allardyce. 'In Ravel’s position, the talent is there, he just has to change his whole life and then hopefully somewhere down the line he’ll become the player he should be.' As revealed by Sportsmail, talks have opened with Lazio. A move to Italy would have to wait until the summer though as Morrison has played in two countries - England and Wales - this season and FIFA don't allow a third. A renaissance in Rome? Not many in Manchester, London, Birmingham or Cardiff would bet on it.","Lazio are keen on signing West Ham midfielder Ravel Morrison .

"Billionaire Klaus-Michael Kuehne has acquired a 7.5 per cent stake at former European champions Hamburg SV after pumping in 18.75 million euros in investment and also bagged the stadium naming rights, the club said on Thursday. Hamburg, struggling to avoid relegation in the past few seasons, has been dogged by financial problems and a string of expensive but unsuccessful transfers. Kuehne's investment is not only a much-needed shot in the arm for Hamburg but a major hope for the long-term future of the only Bundesliga club to never have played in the second division since the top league's creation in 1963. Logistics contractor Klaus-Michael Kuehne has acquired a 7.5 per cent stake at Hamburg . The billionaire will also give the stadium its old name 'Volksparkstadion' back from July 1, 2015 after acquiring the naming rights for 'initially' four years. 'For me as a Hamburg fan it was a matter of the heart that the home of the club has again its traditional name,' Kuehne said in a club statement. 'I wish that the club can enjoy success at the Volksparkstadion like in the past. Hamburg's stadium, currently called the Imtech Arena, was known as the Volksparkstadion until 2001. The logistics tycoon has gained naming rights for the German club's stadium as well as his percentage share . Kuehne will also give the stadium its old name 'Volksparkstadion' instead of the current name Imtech Arena . 'We are continuing our financial consolidation with this move and have reached an important milestone,' Karl Gernandt, Hamburg football board chairman, told reporters. 'We will continue working so that Hamburg can win back its ability to be competitive on all levels in the Bundesliga.'

"Norway midfielder Martin Odegaard was photographed at the Vicente Calderon on Wednesday night watching Real Madrid and Atletico Madrid in the first leg of their Copa del Rey last 16 tie. The 16-year-old has toured Europe's elite clubs as he prepares to leave Norwegian club Stromsgodset, and traveled to Spain from south Oslo on Tuesday ahead of talks with Real. Odegaard is wanted by Bayern Munich, Liverpool, Barcelona and both Manchester clubs, but the La Liga leaders appear in pole position to get his signature.

Odegaard visited Real in November ahead of their Champions League clash against Liverpool, which the Spanish club won 1-0. The teenager is football's hottest property and was most recently linked with Dutch club Ajax. Odegaard is the youngest player in the history of the European Championship after coming on in Norway's win over Bulgaria at the age of 15 years and 300 days.

'I feel a bit sorry for the boy,' Riise told Dagbladet. 'With anticipation the pressure rises. 'There is talk of Real Madrid, Bayern Munich, Barcelona, Liverpool and Arsenal. It makes people expect a lot. But he does seem to have his feet firmly on the ground and it seems like he has a great family around him. 'Even so, it will be tough for him now.

"Ahead of this weekend's Premier League action, Sportsmail will be providing you with all you need to know about every fixture, with team news, provisional squads, betting odds and Opta stats. Here is all the information you need for Swansea's home clash with Chelsea... Swansea vs Chelsea (Liberty Stadium) Team news . Swansea . Swansea start life without Wilfried Bony against Chelsea on Saturday with manager Garry Monk having told Bafetimbi Gomis he is now the main striker at the club. Gomis will lead the forward line against the Barclays Premier League leaders at the Liberty Stadium and on-loan Portuguese striker Nelson Oliveira is now the back-up striker following Bony's midweek departure to Manchester City. Swansea are short of midfield numbers as Jonjo Shelvey completes a four-match suspension and Ki Sung-yueng is away on international duty, but Gylfi Sigurdsson (foot) should play and winger Jefferson Montero could make the bench after making a quicker than expected recovery from the hamstring injury he suffered on Boxing Day. Provisional squad: Fabianski, Rangel, Fernandez, Williams, Taylor, Britton, Carroll, Routledge, Dyer, Sigurdsson, Gomis, Tremmel, Richards, Bartley, Amat, Emnes, Montero, Barrow, Grimes, Oliveira, Tiendalli, Fulton, King. Bafetimbi Gomis leaped above West Ham's defence to score Swansea's equaliser in the 74th minute . Chelsea . The Belgium goalkeeper has been on the bench for the past two matches after sustaining a finger injury on New Year's Day against Tottenham, but is able to come back in for Petr Cech. Chelsea full-back Cesar Azpilicueta remains sidelined with a groin complaint but is set to return to training next week.

Chelsea have won five and lost none of the seven Barclays Premier League meetings with Swansea City. Jose Mourinho’s side have won just one of their last five Premier League away games (W1 D2 L2). Swansea City have dropped more points from winning positions than any other team in the Premier League (16). Cesc Fabregas has more Premier League assists this season (14) than any player managed last term (Steven Gerrard 13). Only one team (Sunderland) has stopped Chelsea from scoring in the Premier League this season. Chelsea have seen six opposition players red carded this season, more than any other team. Swansea are one of two teams who have not had an opposition player sent off against them so far (along with Newcastle). Swansea’s woodwork has been struck 14 times this season, more than any other club.

"Tottenham are monitoring developments with Everton midfielder James McCarthy. The Republic of Ireland man did not travel with the club to Hull on New Year's Day as he protects his hamstring injury. However, clubs have become aware that he has grown frustrated following the lack of talks over a revised contract. The 24-year-old only joined Everton from Wigan in 2013 for £13million and signed a five year deal. It is understood that was linked with incentives and Roberto Martinez has since hinted that he would discuss new terms with the player to reward his performances. VIDEO Scroll down for Garry Monk: Wilfried Bony is focused on Swansea City . Everton midfielder James McCarthy did not travel with the squad to Hull City on New Year's Day . Tottenham are monitoring developments, as he is reportedly unhappy with a lack of contract talks at Everton . McCarthy has been pivotal to Martinez's style and has been one of Everton's most consistent performers. His troublesome hamstring injury has been sorely felt by the team as well as the player this season. His importance has been widely recognised by team-mates and other Premier League clubs have taken keen notice. Krystian Bielik is only 16 years old, but has impressed at Legia Warsaw . Arsenal wanted to buy him in January and were willing to go to £20m but they are wary Everton will refuse all offers and don't want to become engaged in a saga hence looking at other targets. Tottenham have similar reservations but like the player and will see how events develop. Head of recruitment Paul Mitchell was a big admirer of McCarthy during his time at Southampton and watched the midfielder regularly while he was playing for Wigan. Tottenham are in the process of re-shaping their squad and are looking to offload midfielders but believe McCarthy would fit into Mauricio Pochettino's pressing style should he be willing to make the move. Arsenal, meanwhile, have had an opening offer for Legia Warsaw midfielder Krystian Bielik rejected. The 16-year-old also has an offer from Roma. Arsene Wenger has made a bid to bring Krystian Bielik to the Emirates, but it was rebuffed . Real Madrid are showing an interest in Wilfried Bony. The Swansea striker is a target for Manchester City, Liverpool and Tottenham. City have played down their chances of signing the Ivory Coast star but it is understood the club's hierarchy are keen on a £25m transfer. Madrid are scouring Europe for potential new strikers to back up Karim Benzema while rumours also persist that the Frenchman may yet move on in the summer. Javier Hernandez is also expected to return to Manchester United from his loan at Madrid where he has scored four goals in 13 appearances. Madrid are also favourites to sign Marco Reus from Borussia Dortmund although Chelsea, Manchester United and City remain interested. Wilfried Bony, pictured ahead of Swansea's game at QPR on New Year's Day, is interesting Real Madrid . Arsenal and Liverpool have checked on Villarreal striker Luciano Vietto. The 21-year-old was offered to Leicester City for £3.5m last summer but they were unsure about taking a gamble on a young forward from Racing Club who was untried in the English leagues. The Argentina U20 forward, who is looked after by Diego Maradona's former agent Jorge Cyterszpiler, has scored six goals in his last six games and is now rated in the £12m bracket after helping propel Villarreal to fifth in La Liga. Liverpool scouts are looking for forwards who fit into their profile of being quick, technically good and able to play a pressing game. Their budget at this stage means a loan is more likely for January if anything with permanent deals shelved until the summer. Villarreal would be reluctant to sell Vietto in January unless clubs made an inflated offer. Luciano Vietto is in form at Villarreal, and Arsenal and Liverpool are both said to be interested . Chelsea expect Inter Milan to resume talks over a loan deal for Mohamed Salah over the coming days. Inter want a loan with view to a £12m deal for the Egyptian but have also asked about taking Xherdan Shaqiri from Bayern Munich. They expect Shaqiri to choose Juventus although Liverpool have also been asked if they wish to revive interest in the Switzerland star. Chelsea are awaiting news on their bid for Andrej Kramaric. HNK Rijeka's officials are in Dubai and will return to Croatia on Sunday. They want Chelsea to increase their offer for Kramaric while Chelsea will then decide whether to loan him to Leicester or Vitesse. Mohamed Salah (right) is expected to resume talks over a loan deal to Inter Milan in the next few days . Liverpool's highly-rated defender Lloyd Jones has signed for Cheltenham Town on loan and will be joined by team-mates Kevin Stewart and Jack Dunn. Jones, 19, was initially signed from Plymouth and is tipped to make a breakthrough at centre-back while Stewart, 21, a former trainee with Tottenham, is a full back who can play either side. Dunn, 20, can play across the forward line. Liverpool's highly-rated defender Lloyd Jones has signed for Cheltenham Town on loan . Martin Odegaard spent last Thursday training with Manchester United at Carrington before visiting Manchester City but the growing belief is that Ajax may have persuaded him that they could be his best option. Their youth system is renowned and guarantees a quickfire progression into the first team. Odegaard and his father are considering, understandably, whether moves to bigger clubs would stagnate his progress. He is already playing in the first team and is a Norway international at 16. Bayern Munich had been considered favourites to sign him. Martin Odegaard visited Manchester United and Manchester City last week as the Stromsgodset youngster chooses which club to join. Ajax are also interested in the youngster.","James McCarthy did not travel with Everton to Hull on New Year's Day .

"Rangers' own in-house fan group has called on chief executive Derek Llambias and chairman David Somers to come clean after it was revealed Mike Ashley is preparing to take out security on Ibrox Stadium and Murray Park. The Newcastle United owner is willing to hand the club a £10million loan but wants the club's historic stadium and training ground as collateral. And he now has 35 days to agree terms after lodging documents with the Registrars of Scotland which prevent anyone else from using them as guarantees. Mike Ashley will offer Rangers a £10m loan but wants to use Ibrox and Murray Park as collateral . Ashley's pursuit of the club has proved unpopular with the club's fans . The Three Bears - wealthy fans Douglas Park, George Letham and George Taylor - have offered to increase their existing £5million loan offer if it keeps both properties out of Ashley's grasp. But directors Llambias and Somers are under pressure to spell out their plans. The Rangers Supporters Trust have already threatened legal action. Now the Rangers Fan Board (RFB) - the club's official supporter liaison group, set up by former CEO Graham Wallace - has told the board it will never back moves to mortgage off Ibrox. Their statement said: 'The RFB are today insisting on clarity from Rangers Chief Executive Officer Derek Llambias and Chairman David Somers following revelations that Ibrox and Murray Park could be used as security in return for additional funding. 'RFB would like to state that we will never support any moves which could see Ibrox, or the training complex used in this manner. The Rangers fan board has insisted that it will never back any plans to mortgage off Ibrox . 'We have already requested information from Mr Llambias as to the Board's intentions in regard to the Mike Ashley loan offer and so far the CEO has said: 'At this moment in time there has not been a deal done with anyone with regard to loaning the club funds. We are in talks with a number of parties and hopefully an announcement will be made shortly with this effect to the Stock Exchange.' 'An announcement was subsequently made but it did not come close to clarifying the situation and that is why we are pushing for a meeting with the CEO and Chairman. 'We need a categoric assurance that our stadium, which is hugely symbolic, a monument to what this club means and which is also a place of treasured memories will never be used as security. 'It is alarming that advance notices of security were lodged with the Register of Scotland on Tuesday, January 13. 'We must stress again that we would strongly oppose the securitisation of Ibrox. The very notion fills us with dread and since RFB was brought into being to bridge the gap between supporters and the Board we believe it is incumbent upon the directors to meet with us as a matter of urgency.' Meanwhile, fan-ownership campaigners Rangers First have contacted the club's nominated advisor WH Ireland to spell out their concerns. Ibrox is the third largest football stadium in Scotland with a capacity of 50,987 . Mike Ashley appointed his associate Derek Llambias (right) as Chief Executive of Rangers in December . They said in a statement: 'The Rangers First board have written to RIFC's NOMAD to express some of the concerns that have been voiced to us by members over the last 24 hours. 'First, we expressed our deep concern about a notice of intention to grant security being lodged over Ibrox. 'Granting such a notice, at a time when shareholders have been assured that RIFC are currently considering various proposals, seems to be providing the party in whose favour the notice has been granted with an unfair advantage whilst, at the same time, prejudicing the ability to advance discussions with other potential providers of funding. 'We advised that we couldn't see how that was in the best interests of shareholders and requested an urgent explanation. 'Secondly, we indicated that we had been inundated with requests from members to take every possible step to prevent security being granted over Ibrox and advised the NOMAD that we were completely opposed to any proposal which involves security being granted over Ibrox to a lender and that our concern would not be mitigated by any undertakings or covenants granted alongside that security. 'We would call on every shareholder to contact RIFC's NOMAD in similar terms to ensure the NOMAD is aware of the weight of shareholder opinion on this issue.'

"When new Southampton boss Ronald Koeman tweeted a picture of his deserted training ground back in July, it cuttingly captured the empty feeling of those in the dressing-room. Among that disturbed bunch was Jose Fonte, one of the few Saints players not courted by a top-four club. Five of his comrades – Adam Lallana, Rickie Lambert, Dejan Lovren, Calum Chambers and Luke Shaw – had been prised away from the south coast, as had manager Mauricio Pochettino, triggering talk of relegation battles and troubled times ahead. Eljero Elia (left) ran straight to Southampton boss Ronald Koeman to share his first goal for the club . Southampton captain Jose Fonte celebrates with Saints team-mate Victor Wanyama . Fonte – signed by Alan Pardew five years ago with the club in League One – is better placed than most to return assessment of the mood at that time. ‘I cannot be a hypocrite and lie – yes, I was worried, everyone was worried,’ he said. ‘It did not look good for us, but then when we appointed the manager it became easier. ‘I thought, “Well, we have lost players but we have got a very good manager”. Then we started signing players and my confidence grew, slowly at first then more came in.’ Today, not one of the five who quit St Mary’s in the summer reside higher than Fonte and Saints in the Premier League. The Southampton squad celebrate during their 2-1 victory at St James' Park on Saturday evening . Koeman saw Southampton beat Manchester United at Old Trafford to remain in the Premier League top four . This is the rather bleak picture Koeman tweeted in the summer during the busy squad changes at the club . They are third, managerless Newcastle United the latest to fall victim to a playing style which marries craft, graft, silk and steel. There is something utterly convincing about Koeman, too. He is measured but cheery with it, unflappable yet passionate. During one first-half incident on Saturday, Magpies caretaker John Carver lurched over Dusan Tadic – floored on the touchline having just made the most of a Massadio Haidara challenge – and hurled invective at the Serb. Koeman remained stood, hands in his jacket pocket, and smiled at Carver when he eventually cooled, raising his eyebrows and tilting his head in a knowing manner – ‘We’ve got this one in the bag’. Summer signing Graziano Pelle (centre), in action at Newcastle, has 11 goals for Southampton this season . Dusan Tadic, celebrating his winner against Manchester United, is another Koeman acquisition . And he was right. Eljero Elia was the two-goal match-winner. The troubled Dutch winger – who played in the 2010 World Cup final – only arrived at the club earlier this month on loan from Werder Bremen. He celebrated his first goal – a low smash under Holland goalkeeper Tim Krul – by making straight for compatriot Koeman, the man who could well rescue his career. Yoan Gouffran fortuitously levelled for the hosts before Elia stole in to fire his second just after the hour mark. The victory was Southampton’s third on the spin away from home in the league and took them onto 42 points – 'We are staying up' the tongue-in-cheek chant to emerge from the away end. Left back Ryan Bertrand, tackling at St James' Park on Saturday, has been in fine form under Koeman . Elia was the hero, but Koeman signings Tadic, Graziano Pelle, Ryan Bertrand, Florin Gardos and Fraser Forster had also starred, not to mention the outstanding Harrison Reed, the 19-year-old midfielder promoted from the academy this season. Saints stalwart Steven Davis admitted: ‘I didn't know much about Elia. He has given us a little spurt the last two games and if he carries on like that then great. ‘It was a similar story with the others who came in in the summer. As soon as you see them in training and the quality they possess it is a good place to be at the moment. ‘Then you’ve got the young lads coming through, that has been a big positive. We had big players missing in Victor (Wanyama) and Morgan (Schneiderlin) but Harrison showed what he can do.’ Koeman believes they can remain in the top four and qualify for next season’s Champions League. On recent evidence, you would not challenge his assertion. Rather than feeling empty, the Saints are bursting with confidence right now.","Southampton beat Newcastle 2-1 at St James' Park on Saturday night .

Attendance: 6,951 . *Ratings by Ralph Ellis at Ashton Gate . City, knocked off the top of League One 24 hours earlier by Swindon's win at Coventry, will inevitably face a fixture pile-up as a result. They were already due to play seven games in January as they bid to reach Wembley in the Johnstones Paint Trophy as well as get some glitz in the FA Cup. Cotterill said: 'Some people say a lot of games and a promotion run can't go hand in hand but we want to prove that wrong. 'This club had been getting a bit flat almost ever since they lost the play-off final when they might have got into the Premier League in 2008. We've managed to get an up feeling again, and we need to keep it rolling. 'I'm pleased most of all for the chairman. He's put in £50million and all he got was relegated, and is now putting in another £40million for a new stadium. He's enjoying seeing the team win again.' But the win was reward for an attacking intent that Cotterill's team showed as they picked the game up after a flat first 25 minutes. And nobody celebrated the opener from Emmanuel-Thomas – who calls himself JET – more than the manager as he stood in the rain in front of his dugout. Doncaster boss Paul Dickov had been forced to hand a full debut to rookie keeper Marko Marosi after Manchester United recalled Sam Johnstone from a loan spell. But the 21-year-old Slovakian, let go by Wigan last summer, couldn't have asked for a more gentle reintroduction to first team football. It was 25 minutes before he had to make a save, easily getting behind wing back Mark Little's tame shot. But having survived that, the youngster really needed more protection from his defenders and didn't get it.

Butler (left) puts in a challenge on Smith (centre) during the FA Cup third round replay . Centre-half Aden Flint was left unmarked to meet a corner with a firm header, and though Marosi got a hand to it the ball bounced in the six yard box for Emmanuel Thomas to outjump everybody and head home. It was no more than City deserved. Their three-at the-back formation allowed them to open the game up and create danger from the wings where the pace of Little created trouble. But ironically Little had to come to their rescue as a defender right on half time, clearing off the line after James Coppinger had picked his way past two tackles to fire off a shot. And straight after that keeper Frank Fielding saved smartly from Enda Stevens when the former Villa full back broke forward. Marosi did his confidence the world of good with a save straight after the interval, getting in the way of Marlon Pack's close range header. And that seemed to inspire the rest of his team as they went in search of an equaliser, with Dickov throwing on more attacking substitutes to chase the game. Paul Keegan missed from a few yards, but the do-or-die tactics backfired with 12 minutes left as Emmanuel-Thomas got the ball on the half way line and ran all the way – ignoring two team mates before tucking it home with his left foot.

"Zlatan Ibrahimovic chested home a controversial 72nd-minute winner for Paris Saint-Germain against Saint Etienne to ease the pressure on coach Laurent Blanc - but his goal sparked furious scenes at the Stade Geoffroy-Guichard. The Swede's unorthodox finish was a piece of brilliant improvisation yet it forced a fantastic save from St Etienne goalkeeper Stephane Ruffier, who clawed the ball back from beyond the line. Although replays clearly show that the ball crossed the line, home supporters were incensed by the decision to award the goal and threw bottles and other missiles on to the pitch.

St Etienne boss - and a candidate for Newcastle United's vacant head coach position - Christophe Galtier even had to intervene, walking across to different stands and asking supporters to calm down. Despite the frantic scenes, little more than 15 travelling supporters were left elated by Ibrahimovic's League Cup quarter-final winner which bought his manager some extra time in the hotseat.

But Sweden forward Ibrahimovic's goal saw PSG move into the last four of the French League Cup and give Blanc a stay of execution at the very least. After Ruffier saved winger Lucas' effort midway through the second half, Ibrahimovic put PSG ahead in the 72nd minute when he chested in Lucas' cross from the right, although Ruffier was adamant he had scooped the ball away before it crossed the line.

"Tennis' answer to Cricket's Twenty20 - which some have dubbed disco tennis - was on display again on Wednesday with a recovering Rafael Nadal happy to be on the dance floor. The occasion was the official opening of the newly renovated Margaret Court Arena that will give the Australian Open, which starts on Monday, its third stadium with a retractable roof. On Wednesday, 7,500 fans crammed into the arena for a benefit night for the Rafa Nadal Foundation, which assists socially disadvantaged youth. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Rafa Nadal defeats Fernando Verdasco in five set Fast4 thriller .

A general view of the Melbourne Arena area ahead of the day's action of Fast4 Tennis . It also showcased the Australian-developed Fast4, which features major rule variations to speed up the action for players and fans - no advantage scoring, lets are played, and the first to win four games wins the set. Nadal's 4-1 first-set win against the retired Philippoussis lasted only 15 minutes. The often no-nonsense Nadal, introduced to the crowd through a haze of dry-ice smoke and loud music, clearly enjoyed the new format. He joked with the spectators on numerous occasions and once playfully hit a ball into the crowd when someone interrupted him during a serve. He later took a few 'selfies' with his mobile phone. Earlier on Wednesday, Nadal had a training session at Melbourne Park, indicating he might be overcoming some recent health and injury issues.

Nadal was sidelined for three months with a right wrist injury after Wimbledon. He briefly returned in Beijing in late September, advancing to the quarter-final stage. He then had appendix surgery in early November, which he is still recovering from, saying last week in Qatar that he was far from 100 percent. 'This is the third comeback of my career after injury, so we will see how it goes,' Nadal said. On Wednesday night, he also played out a five-setter against Fernando Verdasco, who earlier  beat Gilles Simon in straight sets across town at the Kooyong exhibition tournament. 'It was too quick, I feel like I didn't get a chance to take it all in,' said the 38-year-old Philippoussis, who now plays senior tennis. Fast4 matches don't generally last longer than 75 minutes, even at five sets, with each set lasting about 15 minutes. When a set gets to three games all, a five-point tiebreaker is played - and it's first to five, no need to lead by two points to win.

"Sam Clucas‘s extra-time double set up Chesterfield’s first competitive meeting with county rivals Derby in 27 years. Full-back Clucas scored twice, the second a superb 25-yarder, to terminate Scunthorpe’s three-month unbeaten run and book the fourth-round FA Cup tie with Steve McClaren’s Championship promotion chasers later this month – their previous one came in the third tier of English football in 1988. Stubborn Scunthorpe – whose previous defeat in any competition came way back on October 25 – were finally broken midway through the extra 30 minutes when a flowing Chesterfield move instigated by winger Gary Roberts saw Eoin Doyle slipped into the area and his square ball was guided in by Clucas at the far post.

Roberts almost made it 3-0 with the final action of the night at the Proact Stadium but his howitzer of a free-kick crashed back off the crossbar. Paul Cook’s team, with one defeat in their previous 13 matches, began the resumption of the tie in the ascendancy having clawed back a two-goal deficit at Glanford Park a week ago. But Slocombe kept the 1997 semi-finalists at bay for the opening 45 minutes with an array of fine saves and it appeared that Scunthorpe would be involved in another shoot-out – having beaten non-league Worcester City 14-13 on penalties last month – before Clucas had the final say. The Derbyshire club could have been ahead inside the opening minute as a fast break culminated with right-back Tendayi Darikwa’s first-time shot at the far post being blocked by Scunthorpe goalkeeper Sam Slocombe. It was a busy evening for Slocombe despite the spoiling of Eddie Nolan, in front of the back four. Although it stemmed the waves of home attacks it could not still them altogether and Slocombe was forced to tip over an improvised dink from Eoin Doyle, League One’s top scorer, and then repel a drive from Armand Gnaduillet around an upright. Mark Robins’ visitors might have made them pay with their one clear-cut chance of the first half but Lyle Taylor’s attempted lob of Tommy Lee, following a ball over the top of the home defence, lacked precision. Immediately after the break, Doyle curled another effort just wide but Scunthorpe also threatened in a brief purple patch with Paddy Madden’s shot on the hour searing agonizingly off-target. At the other end, the visiting defence remained resolute under increased pressure: Sam Hird’s improvised chested effort from a corner gleefully clutched by Slocombe who was then thankful to Sam Morsy’s indecision when clear and Miguel Llera’s stooping defensive header as the ball bobbled across the six-yard box. Scunthorpe are not beaten easily. In addition to their recent run, this time last year, under previous manager Russ Wilcox they completed a club record 28 matches without defeat.

"Lionel Messi has once again cast doubt on his Barcelona future by telling the world he does not know where he will play next season. The Argentina superstar had shot down suggestions he would join a club in the Barclays Premier League after Barcelona’s 3-1 win over Atletico Madrid on Sunday. However, the 27-year-old fuelled talk of a move to Chelsea after naming Blues boss Jose Mourinho as his third choice for the prestigious FIFA Coach of the Year. Lionel Messi (centre, in an Adidas hoodie) and Manuel Neuer (left) lost out to Cristiano Ronaldo (right, with a Nike T-shirt) who won the FIFA Ballon d'Or Award on Monday night . Messi has cast doubt over his Barcelona future, admitting 'I don't know where I'll be next year' Messi celebrates after scoring for Barcelona against Atletico Madrid during Sunday's victory at the Nou Camp . Listing Mourinho behind former Argentina boss Alejandro Sabella, who stepped down following the World Cup, and ex-Barcelona manager Pep Guardiola, Messi said: 'Mourinho is a great coach. Whether you like him or not as a person, you have to recognise he’s a great coach.' During a press conference at the FIFA Ballon d’Or gala here in Zurich on Monday, Messi raised the prospect that, perhaps, he could be playing elsewhere by the end of the year. It was the final question of a 30-minute press call and Messi was asked about whether he might consider bringing his glittering career to a close back in Argentina. Messi fuelled talk of a move to Chelsea after naming Blues boss Jose Mourinho as his third choice for the FIFA Coach of the Year award . Messi received 15.8 per cent of the votes to finish ahead of Manuel Neuer, Arjen Robben and Thomas Muller . Cristiano Ronaldo had been asked a similar question about whether he had ambitions for one final challenge but, rather than give a few anodyne quotes, Messi’s answer was far more cryptic. Messi said: ‘I am not sure If I will go back to Newells Old Boys one day. I am not sure where I will be next year. I have always said I will end my career at Barcelona but as Cristiano said, only God knows the future. Things in football can change in football overnight.’ Compare that to Ronaldo, who said: ‘Who knows? Who knows? Only God knows. Listen, I am very happy at Real Madrid. I signed a new deal last year and I am very happy.’ Ronaldo revealed he is 'very happy' at Real Madrid but 'only God knows' where he'll be next year . (From left) Neuer, Messi and Ronaldo are questioned ahead of the Ballon d'Or ceremony . Tensions with Messi and new Barcelona head coach Luis Enrique reached a peak last week when he was left out of the starting line-up for the 1-0 defeat against Real Sociedad. He has subsequently scored in both his games since - against Atletico Madrid and Elche in the Copa del Rey - but this revelation will increase the scrutiny on relationship between Messi and Barcelona. After the game in Sociedad, Messi fuelled speculation that all was not well by following Chelsea on his Instagram account, as well as Chelsea players Thibault Courtois and Luis Felipe. He also missed training the following day, complaining that he had felt unwell.

"Wigan goalkeeper Ali Al-Habsi has seen Australia goalkeeper Mat Ryan up close - and is in no doubt that he is the man to solve Liverpool's goalkeeping problems. Al-Habsi was Ryan's opposite number as Australia beat Oman 4-0 in the Asian Cup last Tuesday but the result could have turned differently after an astonishing save from Ryan kept out a volley from Raed Salah two minutes into the game. 'He's brilliant,' Al-Habsi raved to FourFourTwo. 'He has been fantastic in the World Cup and here in the Asian Cup.' Mat Ryan earned another supporter by impressing Ali Al-Habsi when Australia played Oman . Al-Habsi believes that Ryan is the answer to Liverpool's goalkeeping problems this season . Liverpool's first-choice stopper Simon Mignolet has appeared bereft of confidence throughout the season and his untidy footwork has hindered the passing movements that Brendan Rodgers likes to see his team build from defence. Brad Jones replaced Mignolet in the side for what was intended to be an indefinite period before sustaining a thigh injury against Burnley during the Christmas fixtures. And with Rodgers enforcing a recruitment policy of young players with great potential, Al-Habsi believes 22-year-old Ryan would be a perfect signing at Anfield. 'He's young, he can only improve and, of course Liverpool is a big club and for him it would be a great chance to make it.'

"Talismanic striker Younis Mahmoud was on target but also missed a penalty as Iraq overcame a stubborn Palestine 2-0 on Tuesday to set up an Asian Cup quarter-final with old rivals Iran. The 2007 champions were not at their best but goals by Mahmoud and a late second from Ahmed Yaseen sent them through from Group D as runners-up behind holders Japan, who made it three wins out of three by beating Jordan 2-0 in Melbourne. Mahmoud's 48th minute header was only Iraq's second goal in the tournament and their disjointed attack, which struggled to penetrate the tournament's leakiest backline, will need to improve against a mean Iranian defence which has yet to concede.

Mahmoud has long been the focal figure of the Iraqi frontline, the last link to the 2007 Asian Cup winning side, but his powers are clearly on the wane. His winning goal was a case of third time lucky. Having failed to hit the target in two previous subdued displays against Japan and Jordan he netted with his third chance in as many second half minutes to break the Palestinian resistance. The 31-year-old skipper hooked a right foot shot wide in the 47th minute before Abdallatif Al-Bahdari's outstretched leg blocked his next effort moments later but he finally found a way through from the resulting corner.

The chances continued to come for the Iraqis in a second period of high intensity after a drab first half with the pace and driving runs of Ahmed Yaseen causing problems for the debutants.

"In the end the gloves came off, and Adrian delivered the knockout blow. West Ham and their charismatic goalkeeper are up for the FA Cup. After two games and 210 minutes, a sending-off and 20 penalties, three of which were missed, Sam Allardyce and his team have been rewarded with place in the fourth round and a trip to Ashton Gate to play Bristol City, second in League One, at the end of the month. They can think about that later. VIDEO Scroll down for Sportsmail's Head to Head: Enner Valencia vs Romelu Lukaku .

Wembley, along with the memories of 1964, 1975 and 1980 is a still long way off, not that you would know it by the way West Ham’s players celebrated this incredible night at Upton Park. When Adrian smashed the decisive spot-kick past his opposite number Joel Robles, he set off on the predictable celebration by a corner flag where his West Ham team-mates finally caught up with him. They have put a smile back on the face of the FA Cup. Sometimes you have to say to hell with the quality and think about the drama at a game like this. West Ham fans were lapping it up. They could easily have gone out after the introduction of Kevin Mirallas, who was thrown on in the 67th minute to save this game for Everton when they were down to 10 men. He almost turned match-winner, scoring a magnificent curling equaliser after 82 minutes and then drawing a massive circle inside the West Ham penalty area to supply Romelu Lukaku seven minutes into extra-time. The Belgian forward scored and then it was all about survival for Roberto Martinez and his Everton team. They almost made it over the line but Andy Carroll’s contribution to this third-round victory should not be underestimated. The big man set up the Hammers’ opening goal after 51 minutes with a teasing through ball for Enner Valencia to scramble beyond Everton keeper Robles. When Martinez’s team went down to 10 they looked done. Aiden McGeady, their most creative player in the first half, was the one dismissed after bringing down Mark Noble in the 56th minute and earning a second yellow.

Cole tumbles, pokes out a leg and shoots but the ball rolls agonisingly wide. By BOB TREASURE . Yet into extra-time we went and West Ham responded to Lukaku’s goal with the introduction of substitute Carlton Cole. The big man Carroll met the challenge at the far post and Cole scrambled the 113th-minute equaliser beyond Robles. After that, the entire stadium patiently waited for penalties. On the sidelines the Everton coaching staff linked arms and Steven Naismith and Seamus Coleman celebrated in the centre circle as the penalties were despatched. On they went, with Everton’s magnificent 3,000 travelling fans celebrating each of their strikes after Naismith had missed their second. Lukaku, Leighton Baines, Brian Oviedo, Gareth Barry, John Stones, Phil Jagielka and Coleman matched them, with Stewart Downing missing for the Hammers. Then Robles was forced to take their 10th penalty because Everton were a man down. He took a run-up that would have rivalled a seam bowler, winding himself up and smashing the ball against the bar with an effort that was way off beam. That was the cue for Adrian, who was roared on by an increasingly expectant group of West Ham fans behind the goal in the Bobby Moore Stand who demanded a hero. They got one when he scored, beating his compatriot Robles easily to set up the trip to Ashton Gate. What a night that was. Defeat, even in this cruel manner, will provoke further questions about Martinez’s ability to lead this team. Yes they are out of the FA Cup because of the uncertainty of a penalty shootout, but they have lost six and drawn two of their last eight games. Their last win was against QPR on December 15, when they beat Harry Redknapp’s side 3-1 at Goodison Park. Martinez has had a charmed life in this competition, somehow earning a replay when Lukaku — who now has five goals in five matches against West Ham — equalised in then 90th minute at Goodison Park. Two years ago Martinez had his hands on the FA Cup when Ben Watson’s 90th minute header won it for Wigan on that incredible day at Wembley. Here Mirallas’s remarkable impact after coming on for the desperately disappointing Ross Barkley, stirred the emotions of Everton’s supporters. What a tribute to the group who travelled to see their team recover from Valencia’s 51st-minute goal. At that moment this Everton team looked resigned to be going out. The Hammers, wearing their curious purple shirts for the FA Cup, were in control when Carroll slipped Valencia through.

"South Korea upset Australia 1-0 at the Asian Cup on Saturday to top the Group A standings and secure a potentially easier path to the final while leaving the host nation facing a treacherous route. Striker Lee Jeong-hyeop scored a perfectly-executed goal in the first half to give his team a surprise lead then the Koreans held on against a wave of Australian attacks to clinch the victory. The win meant South Korea finished at the top of the Group A standings with three wins and will play either Uzbekistan or Saudi Arabia in the quarter-finals.

As Group A runners-up, Australia will play the Group B winners China with the defending champions Japan lurking as a possible semi-finalist. The Australians dominated possession and territory but paid a high price for squandering their best chances and resting some of their key players, including star striker Tim Cahill, who only came on for the last 20 minutes when the Socceroos were desperate for an equaliser. The Korean goalkeeper Kim Jin-hyeon pulled off a series of sharp saves to keep his team ahead and the visitors were unlucky not to grab a second on the counterattack as they raised hopes of winning their first Asian Cup since 1960. Lee, who was recalled to the starting lineup after missing South Korea's previous group win over Kuwait, broke the deadlock in the 32nd minute when he got his foot on to a perfectly angled cross from his team mate Lee Keun-ho. The glance was just enough to divert the ball into the net at the far post, evading the diving Australian goalkeeper Mat Ryan. With both teams already assured of a place in the quarter-finals, the two regional powerhouses initially adopted a cautious approach, on a hot and humid evening at Brisbane's Lang Park that was invaded by thousands of moths.

The match began in slightly bizarre circumstances when thousands of moths descended onto the stadium field and grandstands, forcing staff to vacuum some of the benches where players and officials were trying to sit. But once the Koreans scored, the match opened up as both teams ran themselves to the point of exhaustion. Tomi Juric forced the South Korean goalkeeper Kim Jin-hyeon to make a sharp save at the near post after an attacking run while James Troisi just missed the target after he fooled the Korean defence in the box and turned quickly to shoot.

"West Ham supporters have given a mixed reaction after details of a £2,616 corporate hospitality packages at their new Olympic Stadium home were announced. The Barclays Premier League club launched the Boleyn package on Monday, which involves a dedicated bar with free half-time drinks, a VIP entrance and seats on the halfway line for 1,000 fans willing to pay the fee. The deal sees the first season cost £2,616 and those after £2,016, but any supporters interested in the package have to commit for three years, meaning they must pay £6,648 in total.

"West Ham will begin selling season tickets for the Olympic Stadium from this April. The Hammers leave their Boleyn Ground home for Stratford in August 2016. And the east London club will invite season ticket holders, who renew for the final season at Upton Park next season, to be the first to guarantee their seats at the new 54,000-capacity arena. Sportsmail can reveal that West Ham will officially open the doors to their specialist Reservation Centre at the Westfield Shopping Centre in Stratford, just yards from the Olympic Stadium, to kickstart the process. Fireworks mark the opening ceremony of the London Olympic Games at the Olympic Stadium in 2012 . Vast numbers of corporate seats have already been sold on a fixed three-year term, but this is the first time the club's core base of some 20,000 season ticket holders will be able to secure their seat in the new stadium. Supporters who pay the higher 'Band One' fees will be the first to do so in three months time, with those in bands two, three and four - the cheapest of the season tickets available - will be invited across successive dates later in the year before the process concludes next January. Fans will be offered a comparable seat to those they currently have at Upton Park, with a 3D virtual venue viewing technology offering a unique chance to experience what their new sightline and surroundings will be within the stadium. West Ham manager Sam Allardyce (right) poses for a photo with a Hammers supporter at Upton Park . However they must complete a down-payment of 25% of the cost of their season ticket for the 2016/17 campaign on the day of their appointment to guarantee their new seat. West Ham last week announced that all adult season tickets are to rise by 5% - after a price freeze last season - for the final year at Upton Park. In addition to that, fans have been set a deadline of paying a deposit of £75 by the end of April, settling the remainder by the end of May, in line with previous year's renewal deadlines. But a club spokesperson explained: 'The club's first priority is to offer every season ticket holder a comparable seat in the new stadium to the one they have for the final season at the Boleyn Ground. Diafra Sakho celebrates after he scored West Ham's first goal of 2015 at Upton Park . 'Additionally, season ticket holders are able to group their seats together with friends and family and have the opportunity to bring with them up to two new season ticket holders. 'In devising a process to meet those priorities, the club had three guiding principles: that the process should be fair and transparent to all supporters, with the efficiency to accommodate 40,000 supporters coming through the Reservation Centre doors.' Once all 2015/16 season ticket holders' appointments are complete, and the new stadium waiting list has been serviced, any remaining season tickets will be made available for general sale.

"Under 18s? Under 21s? There really is no difference when you can strike the ball like that. Kasey Palmer came off the bench to score a cracker on Tuesday night as Chelsea’s under 18s thrashed Huddersfield Town 6-1 in the fourth round of the FA Youth Cup. 24 hours later, on the very same pitch, he produced another stunner for the under 21s. It left Palmer’s right boot like a cannonball, always rising and swerving, making the goalkeeper’s dive look pathetic as it crashed into the top corner. Kasey Palmer (second right) celebrates scoring Chelsea's first goal of the game on Wednesday night . Chelsea: Jamal Blackman; Trevoh Chalobah (Kyle Scott 54), Jordan Houghton (c), Dion Conroy, Fankaty Dabo; Nathan Ake, Andreas Christensen, Ruben Loftus-Cheek; Reece Mitchell, Ike Ugbo (Ruben Sammut 75), Kasey Palmer (Hubert Adamczyck 67) Subs not used: Billy Grainger, Mukhtar Ali, Isaac Christie Davies, Ali Suljic .

Scorer: Andre Silva 14 . Booked: Naciel . Referee: Constantine Hatzidakis . Attendance: 397 . It cancelled out Andre Silva’s early opener for Porto in this Premier League Under 21 International Cup encounter and Kyle Scott’s late winner was enough to see the Blues through their group and into the knockout phase. The goal will do wonders for Palmer’s burgeoning reputation too. Signed from Charlton with a little controversy and plenty of compensation midway through the 2012-13 campaign, Palmer, just 18, has graduated quickly to Chelsea’s under 21 set-up. He looks right at home and with a sweet hit like that, not to mention the stamina and dedication to play two nights on the trot, he could go far. It was tricky to draw too many permutations from Group A ahead of this one. Chelsea knew a victory would see them safely through with all three of their fixtures completed. Porto, meanwhile, were inking the first page of their International Cup history. The Blues had already drawn 1-1 with Borussia Monchengladbach and thrashed Norwich 5-0 but this technically-gifted, fleet-footed and skillful Porto side was always going to be the toughest test. The soaking conditions in Aldershot only made for a slick surface, glistening under the floodlights, that seemed to suit the styles of both teams and the contest started at a lightning pace. Ruben Loftus-Cheek tried to take advantage of the extra pace on the grass inside four minutes, firing in a low shot that goalkeeper Aldo Nonteiro dived on top of. And the visiting keeper was scrambling when Palmer sent a low shot creeping past the post after finding an angle in the penalty area. But Porto moved the ball confidently and took the lead on the quarter-hour. A searching ball from the right-wing wasn’t dealt with by Chelsea keeper Jamal Blackman and Silva angled his body to divert a shot towards the unguarded goal. Blues skipper Jordan Houghton dived full-stretch through the six-yard box to try and intercept it but could only help the ball home. Chelsea weren’t in arrears for too long, however, and there were audible gasps around the ground when Palmer’s thunderbolt rippled the top corner of the net, followed by enthusiastic applause. Chelsea players rush to congratulate Kyle Scott after he scored a late winner for the young Blues . It wasn’t long before the Vine was circulating on Twitter - it was a goal thoroughly deserving of a broader audience than the few hundred hardy souls here. Palmer was certainly in the mood and a whipped free-kick from 25 yards narrowly cleared the crossbar though the closing minutes of the first-half certainly didn’t match its opening for entertainment. He almost pulled off the trick a few minutes after the break, but again his free-kick had a little too much elevation. The driving rain and biting, swirling wind sadly sucked the quality out of the contest and things weren’t helped when leading man Palmer was taken off for a well-earned breather midway through the second-half. It meant a first outing in Chelsea colours for Polish youth international Hubert Adamczyck. Ruben Loftus-Cheek (left) tackles Porto's Joris Ditu during the European tie . Porto, who were backed by a very vocal knot of fans in the main stand, nearly retook the lead when Igor Osorio shot over when well-placed barely six yards out. And at the other end, substitute Kyle Scott curled a shot into the keeper’s arms after Adamczyck teed him up with a cheeky backheel. As the clock ticked down, Chelsea stepped up their push for a winning goal. It duly arrived in the first minute of stoppage time when Scott sized up a shot from just outside the box, used the defender as a shield to obscure the keeper’s view and bent the ball into the far corner. It was the perfect end to the night for most present but it’s Palmer’s rocket that will stick in the memory.","Chelsea defeat Porto in Premier League International Cup group stage .

"Victor Valdes is expected to make his Manchester United debut in the less-than-glamorous surroundings of Cambridge United's Abbey Stadium on Friday night. The former Barcelona keeper, who has won three Champions League titles and a World Cup, is set to don the gloves for United for the first time in their FA Cup fourth-round clash at the League Two side's 8,100-capacity home. Valdes, 33, signed an 18-month contract at Old Trafford earlier this month and has been named on the bench for United's Premier League matches at QPR and at home to Southampton behind David de Gea. Victor Valdes is set to make his Manchester United debut against Cambridge in the FA Cup fourth round . However, he is expected to play for the first time since suffering a cruciate knee ligament injury in Barcelona's clash with Celta Viga last March. United manager Louis van Gaal, who worked with Valdes during his own second stint at the Nou Camp, invited the keeper to the club to complete his rehabilitation. Fellow Spaniard De Gea has once again been in sterling form this season and is rumoured to have interested Real Madrid. The 24-year-old's contract expires in 18 months and with no extension agreed speculation grew that he may be set to depart Old Trafford. However, Van Gaal moved to reassure supporters that he will shortly pen a new long-term deal. The 33-year-old Valdes joined United on a 18-month deal in January - with the option of an extra year .

'He (Valdes) is someone that we all look up to through what he's achieved already in his career but you can see that he's nowhere near done yet,' said Smalling. 'On the training field he's so sharp and you can see that he's very agile. He's such a great addition and is a name that really belongs here at Manchester United. 'We've heard a few stories from him and quite a few people here have asked him questions. Barcelona is another great club and you want to get some insight of what happens abroad as well.'Â .

"Bayern Munich will not stockpile young players just to send them out loan like Chelsea, claims technical director Michael Reschke. Chelsea have sent 30 players out on loan this season and last season allowed big-name young players such as Romelu Lukaku and Kevin De Bruyne to leave Stamford Bridge to gain first team football before eventually selling them. Earlier this month they had also hoped to sign 23-year-old Andrej Kramaric from HNK Rijeka and then loan him to Leicester before the deal fell through and the Croatian signed for Nigel Pearson's side instead. Andrej Kramaric (left) was wanted by Chelsea before he joined Leicester City . Romelu Lukaku is now at Everton having played for them on loan from Chelsea last season . Kevin De Bruyne (left) is another former Chelsea player who has since moved on from Stamford Bridge . Such a policy has seen Jose Mourinho's side criticised and Reschke insists Bayern - who have three promising players, Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg, Jan Kirchhoff and Julian Green, on loan - do not operate in the same way. 'Sending players out on loan is not part of our philosophy. It's a decision we make case by case,' he told SID. 'We always make a well-considered decision what's best for a certain young player in his situation. 'For example, a temporary spell with Augsburg is a great solution for Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg but there's no policy or clear philosophy behind it like at Chelsea. Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg has been loaned by Bayern Munich to Augsburg . 1. Tomas Kalas – Koln (season-long) 2. Wallace – Vitesse (season-long) 3.

"It is quite probably the biggest game in the history of Royston Town Football Club - and it won't even be the first team playing. The Hertfordshire club's under 18 side have landed a glamour tie with Premier League Arsenal in the fourth round of the FA Youth Cup and it will be played on Wednesday night.

But that is roughly the number expected to make the 35-mile journey to Meadow Park in Boreham Wood to cheer on their youth team against the mighty Gunners. The only non-league outfit left in this season's Youth Cup, Royston started their run back on September 10 and have seen off Romford, Bowers & Pitsea, East Thurrock United, Brentwood Town, AFC Sudbury, Welling United and Oxford City to set up this attractive fixture with the seven-time Youth Cup winners. They will come up against such highly-rated youngsters Daniel Crowley, Ainsley Maitland-Niles and Gedion Zelalem, all youth internationals. The last two have been involved with Arsene Wenger's first team. For Royston club president Alan Barlow, entering his 40th year of involvement at the club, it's a moment to savour. He told the Cambridge News: 'As far as the history of the club goes, it's a stand-out moment for us. 'We're the only non-league team left in the competition and it's a great achievement by the boys to reach this stage. 'It's the furthest we've ever been. We've had a few small rund in the FA Vase with the first team, but we've often been knocked out in the earlier round of the competition. 'It's got everyone at the club talking.' This Youth Cup run is certainly up there - the furthest Royston have reached in the FA Vase, the competition for non-league sides, is the fifth round and they have never been beyond the third qualifying round in the FA Cup. The first team finished seventh in Division One Central last season but they were 10 points shy of the play-offs.

Liverpool vs Derby County (7pm, Live on LFCTV) Everton vs Southampton (7pm) Arsenal vs Royston Town (7pm) Swansea City vs Doncaster Rovers (7pm) The youth team, led by Liam McDevitt, are still unbeaten in the Thurlow Nunn Youth League, West Division and perhaps that explains why Arsenal are taking nothing for granted. Young playmaker Crowley, who has drawn comparisons to Jack Wilshere, told the club's official website: 'If course we're going to take it seriously. You have to win your game. If you don't, you're out. There is a lot more pressure on you to win.'

"Louis van Gaal must address Manchester United’s defensive lack of ‘control’ if they are to challenge rivals City and Chelsea for the Premier League, admits Gary Neville. The former right back believes the departures of Rio Ferdinand and Nemanja Vidic have had a profound impact on the Reds, claiming they are without a calming influence at the back. David Moyes endured chronic problems last season, with Van Gaal still struggling to hit on the sort of formula Sir Alex Ferguson cracked for years. Louis van Gaal address a lack of defensive control, according to former defender Gary Neville . Since the loss of Nemanja Vidic (left) and Rio Ferdinand (right) United have struggled for leadership and control . And that is what sets Chelsea apart from United, argues Neville. ‘What I always think you want in defenders is control and composure,’ he told Stretty News. ‘They know where they are meant to be and are not always diving around on their backside. Ferdinand and Vidic is [Steve] Burce and [Gary] Pallister. It’s as good as it gets in football. ‘They are always in the right positions and they always clear the ball out of the box. I don’t mean always as they’ve all made mistakes but there’s a composure and understanding there that in the big moments of a match they are not going to be flapping. Instead they control and settle everybody around them.’ Neville himself is aware of what it takes to be a leader, having captained Manchester United in the past . Neville celebrates passionately after Manchester United beat Manchester City during his playing days . Jose Mourinho has seen his league leaders concede just 15 goals, and Neville puts that down in no small part to their captain. ‘John Terry does that at Chelsea you’ve got to admit. He brings a level of real control to the defence. When I look at the United defence what it lacks is control. ‘I see players that have talent but they’re all individually working, not having controlled movements together of in-sync. That comes through understanding and from playing together.’ Neville went on to praise calming influence of Michael Carrick, labelling him Manchester United's midfield 'piano'. The Reds have improved from the days of Moyes since the arrival of Louis van Gaal in the summer, and Carrick has been an integral part of the team that has taken them to fourth in the Premier League. Neville cites Chelsea captain John Terry (pictured) as an example of the calming presence United need . Michael Carrick, in Manchester United's midfield, brings the influence that Neville thinks is so important . In fact, Carrick has played every minute of League football since November 8, bar half an hour against Newcastle on Boxing Day. 'When you play with Michael Carrick you think there is authority, control, peace,' Neville said. 'When you are on a football pitch playing against Liverpool or Manchester City, you need peace around you as well. 'You sometimes don’t want people running around like blue-arse flies. Scholes and Carrick together was peaceful. It was like going into a bar and hearing a piano playing. It’s relaxing. Listening to some good rock is good and you like that too but sometimes it’s nice to listen to a piano. Carrick’s a piano.' Carrick has played almost every minute of Premier League football since the start of November . Carrick (centre), according to now Sky Sports pundit Neville, is a 'piano' in the Manchester United midfield . United's start to Van Gaal's reign was far from desirable, and guess who wasn't present until November? Carrick. Neville thinks that when it comes to the team-sheet, the 33-year-old is one of the first names Van Gaal jots down. 'If you look at Louis van Gaal at the start of the season and we were struggling, ask yourself who wasn’t playing? Michael Carrick wasn’t playing. Now he’s playing and the club went on a great unbeaten run. I think he would be first or second on Louis van Gaal’s team-sheet because he brings control and authority. 'Manchester United fans get it. I wanted Bryan Robson and someone to run through brick walls and coming out with bandages wrapped around his head. That’s what Manchester United fans want.'","Gary Neville thinks that Manchester United have struggled following the exits of Nemanja Vidic and Rio Ferdinand .

"Manchester United will hold a meeting on Friday to decide whether to spend big on a defender in the next two weeks. Manager Louis van Gaal will meet United officials to formulate plans for this transfer window and the summer. Buying a new right back will top the agenda with Everton’s Seamus Coleman, 26, and Southampton’s Nathaniel Clyne, 23, both candidates. Everton's Seamus Coleman (right) has attracted interest from Manchester United, who want a new right back . Southampton defender Nathaniel Clyne (left) has also been mentioned as a possible target for the Reds . Van Gaal, who has spent more than £156million since last summer, wants to boost his chances of qualifying for next season’s Champions League. His more serious spending will happen in the summer, with a central defender the priority, but a late move for Coleman or Clyne is not impossible. Everton are adamant they will not sell, but United would expect to pay more than £20m — a huge profit on a player who cost just £60,000. Borussia Dortmund and Germany defender Mats Hummels has been on Louis van Gaal's radar for a while . Schalke's Benedikt Howedes (right) could also be in line for a move to Old Trafford in this transfer window . Clyne has also had an impressive season. After making his England debut he is arguably now his country’s first choice. Van Gaal will focus on buying a central defender in the summer, with Borussia Dortmund’s Mats Hummels and Schalke’s Benedikt Howedes on his radar. United are also keeping close tabs on Celtic’s Virgil van Dijk. United will also discuss if it is time to offload a few players — Radamel Falcao among them. The Colombian was dropped last Sunday and it is looking unlikely that United will sign him on a permanent deal at the end of the season.

"This time a year ago he was a welcome ray of sunlight in a dark winter of discontent for Manchester United. With pressure growing on David Moyes the form of Adnan Januzaj was one of few reasons to be cheerful for the sing-as-they-suffered Stretford End faithful. As the under-fire Scot searched for a winning formula (sound familiar?) the youngster signed from Anderlecht in 2011 for £300,0000, was one of only two players to play every game last January. Adnan Januzaj (right) has fallen down the pecking order at Manchester United under Louis van Gaal . Januzaj (left, with Marouanne Fellaini last week) is expected to be sent out on loan this transfer window . Adnan Januzaj has gone from being a central player at United to a peripheral figure in less than a year. 2013-2014 . Appearances: 35 Goals: 4 . 2014-2015 . Appearances: 11 Goals: 0 . The 2013 reserve team player of the year had earlier announced himself with a winning brace in a 2-1 win at Sunderland. Born in Belgium to Albanian-Kosavar parents, almost immediately a tug-of-war over his international allegiance was underway. Roy Hodgson declared an interest and United, wary of similar competition among rival clubs, quickly jumped in with a five-year contract. Officials at Old Trafford had serious concerns he may go the same way as Paul Pogba, who jumped ship to Italy to much dismay. Januzaj signed on the dotted line, pledged his allegiance to Belgium and seemed to get better and better. At the end of the season he could look back with pride on making 35 appearances, despite United's annus horribilis, and look forward to a place in the Marc Wilmotts' much-fancied squad at the World Cup. Januzaj (left) scores his second goal of the game for United in the 2-1 win over Sunderland last season . Januzaj is mobbed by his team-mates after scoring the winning goal against Sunderland . David Moyes (left) and Phil Jones (right) congratulate the manager after his performance against Sunderland . Then Louis van Gaal arrived at Old Trafford and it all changed. This season he has started and finished just two games. At the last count he has 27 minutes under his belt since the first week in November. Some have even claimed that he only stood out last term because he was in such a poor team and reckon his new teacher is not impressed. They are wrong and there is mitigation. Van Gaal, armed with an open chequebook, paid a British record £59.7million for Angel di Maria. The seemingly-immovable Wayne Rooney is now being deployed in midfield. Juan Mata is shining behind the strikers. It is a tough line to get to the front of. Van Gaal's preference for a three-man defence, with the added creativity deploying two wing backs brings, has also damaged the young playmaker's chances. And nobody would rule against further big-money arrivals in the summer – chief executive Ed Woodward has hinted at it more than once. As reported by Sportsmail, Januzaj is now expected to depart on loan during this transfer window. Januzaj (left) has only played 27 minutes of football this season under Louis van Gaal . Januzaj, pictured here playing for the Under 21s, has only made two top-flight starts this season . So where next? Moyes remains a keen admirer. In a recent interview with Four Four Two magazine the former United boss, rebuilding his career with Real Sociedad, compared Januzaj with Johan Cruyff, no less. The teenager may well be tempted to rid himself of that sinking feeling on the San Sebastian coast and Moyes has already revealed he will attempt to borrow reinforcements this month. A less physical competition such as La Liga, along with the increased time on the ball it allows, may well suit a player not noted for his physical presence. Van Gaal has always been keen on promoting from within and nurturing youth from his early days as a coach. Louis van Gaal has told Man United chief executive Ed Woodward that Januzaj is not in his current plans . But he has also shown he is not afraid of getting rid of homegrown talent to Premier League rivals – just ask Danny Welbeck. And in England there are likely to be other suitors. Everton are known to be admirers and the chance to link up with Belgium team-mates Kevin Mirallas and Romelu Lukaku may well turn the youngsters head. A switch to Goodison Park may also get the thumbs up from United pal Maroune Fellaini. The pair are inseparable and Fellaini will no doubt relay fondly tales of his time on Merseyside although he too will sing Moyes' praises. Seamus Coleman (left, in action against West Ham on Tuesday) is a target for Manchester United . For United, thought to be monitoring Seamus Coleman, lending Januzaj to Roberto Martinez may well go a long way to opening doors at Everton in their pursuit of the Irish right back further down the line. Wherever he goes, if he does at all (and knowing United's luck with injuries this season that is always subject to change), he will need to impress. What a difference a year makes.","Adnan Januzaj is expected to leave Manchester United on loan this month .

"Former EastEnders actor Kiruna Stamell, who has dwarfism, took legal action against the Post Office because she could not reach their chip-and-pin machines . A former Eastenders actress with dwarfism will no longer struggle to reach chip-and-pin machines at the Post Office after suing the company for disability discrimination. Kiruna Stamell, who appeared on Albert Square as well as in Moulin Rouge!, launched legal action after she was 'humiliated' in a branch. The 33-year-old actress said she found branches inaccessible for someone her size as she could not reach card machines that were fixed to the top of the counter. On one occasion Ms Stammel said she and other customers had to wait while staff built makeshift steps out of cardboard boxes so she could put in her pin. The Post Office settled with her and has now brought in devices that can be handed to customers in hundreds of branches across Britain. Ms Stamell, who is just over a metre tall, told the BBC: 'It was really embarrassing, because there was a very large queue of people behind me. 'I just wanted to be able to put my pin in like everybody else and post a letter and to withdraw cash, and I wasn't able to reach the machine and it wasn't able to be passed to me. 'So staff were improvising random steps out of cardboard boxes, and it was really quite humiliating.' Ms Stamell, who played a minor role in EastEnders and starred alongside Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman in 2001 film Moulin Rouge!, claimed for disability discrimination because of the Post Office's failure to make adjustments to their machines so she and other people her height could use them. 'The design was less flexible than in other shops. In places like Boots, Tesco and my bank the pin machines are held in a holster. They also have a broader range of movement because they are on a flexible tether, so can be handed to the customer,' she explained. 'When I shop most places, I am usually handed the pin machine by shop staff, so I can privately enter my pin. 'Unfortunately, I had several negative experiences at post office counters and for many years I have had difficulty paying for their goods and services. After a couple of really upsetting experiences at various branches, I realised, something needed to change.' Ms Stamell, who appeared on Albert Square as well as in Moulin Rouge!, launched legal action after she was 'humiliated' in a branch . Ms Stammell, pictured at a curtain call for stage show Great Britain in September, said she was made to wait at one Post Office branch while staff built makeshift steps so she could reach the fixed card machine . The Post Office settled with the actress and have changed their machines so they can be held by customers at hundreds of stores . Mark Davies, the Post Office's communications director, said he would encourage customers who are unhappy to let staff know so improvements could be made. He said: 'We are absolutely going to listen to them and I think, as in the case with Kiruna, we've listened to the points that she's raised with us, we've taken action.' A spokeswoman for the Post Office added: 'We want to make it as easy as possible for the millions of people who visit our branches each week to access our services. We listen to our customers and are pleased to be making the improvements needed following the concerns raised by Kiruna Stammell. 'As a result we are now introducing these changes to pin pads in the over 300 of our biggest branches in high streets and city centre. Pin pads are being adapted by introducing a flex which allows them to be removed from their holder. 'In addition as part of a wider modernisation programme we are making it easier to access services, through new improved low level counters in thousands of branches and also over 1,000 branches now have flexible pin pads.'","Kiruna Stamell sued Post Office because she couldn't reach card machines .

"For the co-founder of Skype said to be worth more than half a billion pounds, the £1.1million house he bought in 2009 was not going to break the bank but it was his dream home. However, once Niklas Zennstrom, 46, scratched the 'veneer of quality' of his new Bauhaus-style mansion, it soon became clear the 'shambolic' property was in such a bad state he had to knock it down and start again. Behind its glazed walls and minimalist interiors the house on one of Britain's most desirable private estates in Hampshire, had such serious . defects that made it unfit for human habitation, the millionaire said. Modern: This is the house at the centre of the High Court row before it was knocked down by Skype founder Niklas Zennstrom . Changes: The entrepreneur, said to be worth £600m, has since started rebuilding the home but pursued the former owners through the courts and lost yesterday . Dream: The property (circled) sits facing the Hamble marina in an enviable position but soon after this picture was taken it was condemned . A more recent image shows where the house used to stand . The keen yachtsman and his wife had moved there because it is a stone's throw from the famous marina on the River Hamble. His anger was such that the Swede took the previous owners Deborah Wilks and Helen Moseley   to court, but he has failed to convince a top judge that he was a victim of unscrupulous property developers. Mr Justice Edwards-Stuart said Mr Zennstrom’s case had not looked promising from the start and concluded that neither Ms Moseley nor Ms Wilks had been aware of any significant construction defects. He said the evidence pointed . 'overwhelmingly' to the conclusion that Ms Moseley and Ms Wilks had . created their 'dream home' - which enjoys spectacular views over Hamble . Marina from Crowsport Private estate - and did intend to sell when they . embarked on a re-building project. Row: Keen yachtsman Niklas Zennstrom and his wife Catherine bought the home on the Hampshire coast from Deborah Wilks (pictured right yesterday) and her partner but the court found in their favour . Imagination: Niklas Zennstrom and Janus Friis came up with the idea of Skype in 2003 and within 8 years it was sold for $8.5bn . Jan 2003: Entrepreneurs Niklas Zennstrom and Janus Friis come up with the concept of Skype. Apr 2003: Skype is launched in beta but the first version was rough to say the least. Calls dropped and voice quality was shaky. Oct 2005: eBay buys Skype for $3.1billion - two years . Jan 2006: Skype adds video calling. Apr 2009: . Skype keeps expanding but doesn't make enough money. eBay has enough . and suggests it wants to offer Skype on a initial public offering. Sep 2009: eBay announces sale of 65 per cent of Skype to a group of Index Ventures and Silver Lake Partners. May 2011: Microsoft buys Skype for $8.5billion . The . lesbian couple - who celebrated a civil partnership in 2008 and had . been together for 20 years - said afterwards the case had left them . 'physically and mentally' drained. 'The . evidence points overwhelmingly, in my view, to the conclusion that they . built it as their dream home as they have always contended', the judge . told them yesterday. In true Grand Designs-style, Ms Moseley and Ms Wilks bought the property in 2004 for £360,000, later demolishing the existing house there and building what they hoped would be the sort of Bauhaus beauty beloved of Channel 4 presenter Kevin McCloud. The couple, from the Southampton area, told the court that, despite their intense desire to live in the house, they were forced to sell to the Zennstroms because of trouble meeting the mortgage and difficulties with a near neighbour. Skilled entrepreneur Zennstrom helped build the Skype brand into an online giant. In May 2011 the internet phone service was bought by Microsoft for around $8.5billion, its biggest-ever cash deal,  and Zennstrom is believed to have got at least $500million of it. During the home-row court case Mr Zennstrom’s barrister, Richard Morgan QC, had told the court he believed he was buying a 'new luxury house', built to a high standard. 'Instead, once the sale was complete and builders started opening up areas to undertake what should have been minor works, it became apparent that the construction of the property was a shambles,' he said. Rich: Skype co-founder Niklas Zennstrom is said to be worth £600million, much of which was generated when the online phone service was sold to Microsoft for $8.5billion . Start again: Zennstrom was forced to bring in the builders to his Bauhaus-mansion in Hamble, Hampshire because he claimed it was unsafe . Site: The keen yachtsman bought it on the Crowsport private estate which is a matter of metres from the famous Hamble marina . Major defects had been disguised behind . finishes that gave 'the veneer of quality' but which hid problems which . gave no choice but to demolish and start again. Not only was the house not fit for human habitation, he claimed, but it was also dangerous in some respects and had to be knocked down. However, dismissing the Zennstroms’ claims against Ms Wilks and Ms Moseley, the judge said they were genuinely ignorant of the ins and out of construction work and had not operated as commercial property developers.","Niklas Zennstrom bought the Bauhaus home in Hampshire in 2009 .

"Revenue chiefs are naming and shaming tax dodging small firms while multinationals avoid paying billions. Nine ordinary business people, including a hairdresser and a coach operator, were listed by HMRC as part of a scheme to highlight deliberate defaulters. The idea is that the stigma of appearing on the list, to be updated every three months, will persuade those thinking of avoiding tax to pay up. Name and shame: The list, published on the HM Revenue and Customs website today, name individuals and companies who, after investigation by the HMRC, have been discovered to fail to fully enclose what they owe . List of shame: Nine ordinary business people, including a hairdresser and a coach operator, were named by HMRC today and more will get the same treatment . But MPs and tax experts last night criticised the plan for targeting ordinary individuals while doing nothing to uncover tax avoidance among big companies such as Starbucks, Amazon and Google. Twitter has also been awash with angry members of the public accusing HMRC of being too frightened to target the 'big boys'. Another tweeter said that big business is just allowed to send vast sums offfshore while the tax man embarrass 'small fry' firms. Richard Murphy, of Tax Research, said the list was ‘plain, straightforward hypocrisy’ which was simply ‘identifying plumbers and hairdressers when it should be naming global corporations’. ‘The people named are easy targets. There are clearly different categories of tax crime, with small businesses who put cash in HMRC’s pockets named and shamed; but banks, wealthy lawyers and global corporations offered anonymity. 'It seems that only little people pay tax and only little people are named and shamed.’ And Margaret Hodge, chairman of the . Commons public accounts committee, said: ‘They have named and shamed a . whole lot of small and medium sized businesses. 'That is welcome because everyone should pay their tax. But I hope that they are not letting bigger fish off of the hook.’ Easy targets: Richard Murphy, of Tax Research, said the list was 'straightforward hypocrisy' which was simply 'identifying plumbers and hairdressers when it should be naming global corporations' The . tax owed by the nine on the list amounted to less than £1million – far . less than the £5billion understood to be lost every year because of . aggressive tax avoidance by big corporations. Starbucks, Amazon and Google have all come under fire in recent months for complicated tax avoidance schemes. Coffee chain Starbucks had sales of £400million in the UK last year – but paid no corporation tax. Web . firm Amazon, which had sales of £3.4billion in 2011, only paid . £1.8million while Google paid just £6million out of UK turnover of . £395million. Speaking . in Bombay on Monday, Mr Cameron likened ‘aggressive’ forms of tax . avoidance by multinational companies to illegal tax evasion. ‘I think there is a legitimate debate to say very aggressive forms of avoidance are not appropriate,’ he said. ‘And particularly, in a country which has set a very low tax rate, it is fair to ask people to pay it.’ Earlier this week Mrs Hodge’s committee called on HMRC to publicly list promoters of tax avoidance schemes and those who used them. The list published yesterday by HMRC includes people who have been found guilty of evading more than £25,000 of tax. They were found during investigations . by the taxman after April 2010. Large firms on the other hand do not . evade tax; they seek ever more complicated legal ways of avoiding paying . it. The taxman has cracked down on smaller firms including a plumber. Other targets included a hairdress and coach operator (picture posed by model) Treasury minister . David Gauke said: ‘The publication of these names sends a clear signal . that cheating on tax is wrong and reassures people who pay their taxes – . the vast majority – that there are consequences for those who refuse to . tell HMRC about their full liability.’ When asked why no large corporations . were on the list, Mr Gauke said HMRC was taking action to close legal . loopholes, and those who prompted aggressive tax avoidance schemes were . also being exposed. The first list features nine names, including a hairdresser, the owner of a coach firm, a wine retailer and a knitwear manufacturer. They received fines ranging from a few thousand pounds to £291,830 for wine company The Trade Beverage Company of Mobberley in Cheshire. David Gauke said the publication of the names showed a clear signal that cheating on tax is wrong, but Margaret Hodge said she hoped the big fish were not being let off the hook . Under the new plan, called the . Managing Deliberate Defaulters scheme, anyone who evades tax will also . have their financial affairs watched closely for up to five years to . make sure they do not re-offend. The crackdown was aimed at deterring . would-be tax evaders. It started with letters being sent to 900 known . tax dodgers warning them they will stay in the Revenue’s sights for up . to the next five years. Ordinarily, tax offenders can be fined up to 100 per cent of the tax they have not paid, plus the payment of the back taxes plus interest. Offenders who have been trying to evade tax in some offshore jurisdictions now face fines of up to 200 per cent of their unpaid tax. HMRC has the option of prosecuting the worst offenders, which can lead to them being sent to jail if convicted. In order for someone to be named on the website, they must have failed to fully disclose what they owed at the outset. The taxman can only publish defaulters’ names for a year and within 12 months of the penalty becoming final. Details are published only once all appeal routes have been exhausted. Name .

"As fresh faced children who murdered their father as he slept in a chair, Derek and Alex King caught the nation's attention in 2001. But now, after spending a third of their lives behind bars, the brothers who were found guilty of murder when they were 12 and 13 are hoping for a more positive future. After years of being moved between foster homes and being occasionally cared for by their father, Terry, at a Florida home that had no power, the King brothers' main ambition is stability and a family of their own they told People magazine. New beginnings: Derek King, left, and his brother Alex, right, are coming to terms with life outside prison . Poor start: Alex, left, and Derek, right, pictured during their trial for murder in 2001 . 'I'm trying to figure out what a typical . family is,' Derek, now 25, said. The restaurant worker who is saving money so he can finish college, was convicted of killing his father with a baseball bat when he was 13, while his younger brother, then aged 12, egged him on. The brothers, who set fire to their family home after killing their father, don't like to talk about the past, but both accept responsibility for it. Derek, who is only now learning how to build relationships, told People he is keen to get married and settle down. 'My dream is to have a family,' the young man, who after his release in 2009 was left baffled by the changes in the world, said. 'I'd never heard of Facebook,' he said, adding that in prison he had turned to the Harry Potter children's books for inspiration. The 25-year-old said he could relate to Harry Potter's dismal family life and added that like that character: 'I was a kid who finds he really is special and has things to offer.' His brother, Alex, who was accused of suggesting that Derek killed their father, also struggled with life on the outside. He is currently back in prison after violating his parole and leaving the scene of an accident in 2011. But, like his brother, the 24-year-old who loves to study math and microbiology, is keen to live a simple, quiet life. On trial: The boys' court case gripped the nation as the youngsters were found guilty of killing their father . Accused: Ricky Chavis, pictured in court, was found guilty of accessory after the fact of murder . 'I don't need luxury' he told People. 'I like creature comforts: a nice couch, a flat-screen TV.' He added that 'being around others motivates me to do right,' and is looking forward to his release so he can be reunited with his girlfriend in California. Alex had a little extra help settling into life outside the prison walls after journalist Kathryn Medico welcomed him into her family, and acted like a surrogate mother to him when he was first released. She met Alex when she was researching a book on the brothers' crime, and soon started visiting him regularly and supporting him. Mrs Medico said while she was devastated when she missed the chance to hear him give his valedictory speech at his prison high school graduation, the teenager was just excited to have someone to celebrate with. 'He . had so many disappointments in his life that it didn't matter I wasn't . there for the speech,' she told People. 'It mattered that I was the family . there and meeting everyone.' While they were in prison the boys had no contact, but after their release they were were able to spend time together, and both are keen to prove to their supporters that they will do something positive with their life, Today reported. Before killing their father both boys had a difficult upbringing. They had been abandoned by their drug-addict mother and had been raised separately in a succession of foster homes. Guilty: Derek and Alex were sentenced to prison for killing their father in 2001 . It was during a brief moment of living together again at their father's home, that the boys met convicted child molester Ricky Chavis, who was accused at the trial of manipulating the youngsters. At their trial, the convicted child molester was accused of taking an inappropriate interest in Alex. The boy testified in court that he and Chavis had been having oral sex but the court deemed there wasn't enough evidence and Chavis was acquitted of molesting the child. However, he was sentenced to 35 years in prison after being found guilty of being an accessory to murder and tampering with evidence. The King brothers say Chavis gave them attention and treats they didn't get at home. 'We looked up to Ricky,' Derek said. The 41-year-old had a secret room in his home where the boys were allowed to play video games, miss school and smoke marijuana, their trial heard. Hope: Derek and Alex King want to move on with their lives and have families of their own . The judge felt that Alex had been vulnerable and manipulated by Chavis, leading to the 12-year-old's second-degree murder charge being replaced with a lesser third-degree charge. However, both brothers are ready to admit their crime and take responsibility for it. 'I take responsibility for killing him. I will pay for it for the rest of my life,' Derek said.","Derek and Alex King were children when they were sent to jail for murder .

"Danny Cipriani’s hopes of a Six Nations recall have been boosted by two conversations with England head coach Stuart Lancaster. The Sale fly-half has been in outstanding form following a summer in which he made two substitute appearances on England’s injury-hit tour to New Zealand — his first international caps for six years. Danny Cipriani has played himself into contention for England recall with outstanding displays . The 27-year-old, who will consider a move to French club Toulon if he is overlooked for the upcoming tournament, remains behind Bath’s George Ford and Saracens’ Owen Farrell in England’s No 10 pecking order. But he is putting pressure on current third choice Stephen Myler, of Northampton, following some superb recent displays. Lancaster met last week with Cipriani — whose brushes with authority and high-profile lifestyle have made England coaches wary of recalling him — and Sportsmail understands they also spoke on Tuesday. ‘Danny’s encouraged by the conversations with Stuart,’ said a source. Cipriani is expected to be named in the Saxons side to face Irish Wolfhounds on January 30. Cipriani will consider a move to French club Toulon if he is overlooked for Six Nations . Lancaster and his coaches will hold a selection meeting on Thursday. He will announce his 33-man Six Nations squad next Wednesday ahead of the opening fixture against Wales on February 6. Meanwhile, London Irish are set to announce the signing of All Black star Ben Franks. Sportsmail understands the 41-cap prop will join the Sunbury-based outfit after the 2015 World Cup in a deal worth around £300,000 per season. The Exiles also confirmed that another Kiwi — highly rated Chiefs assistant coach Tom Coventry — will take over as director of rugby from the departed Brian Smith next season. Coventry said in a radio interview in New Zealand: ‘I’m pretty sure he (Franks) has gone through the process of signing his contract with them. ‘It’s good to have him there, another Kiwi and a quality player. ‘Obviously I was training teams to combat Ben’s strength so it would be nice to have him on my side for a change.’","Danny Cipriani held talks with England head coach Stuart Lancaster .

"Just seconds had passed after the final whistle before one thug decided to hop the barriers, charge towards Nottingham Forest’s victorious players and start swinging. The Derby fan threw two punches at defender Kelvin Wilson — failing to land either — before being rugby tackled to the ground by Jamaal Lascelles and then escorted away by stewards. This east Midlands derby is one of the most frantic rivalries in British football but the last thing it needs is idiots like this. The man was arrested and faces a life ban. Stuart Pearce celebrates wildly after Ben Osborn's late winning goal as Forest beat rivals Derby 2-1 . The Derby fan swung a punch at Nottingham Forest defender Kelvin Wilson, who moved out out of the way . A Derby County fan is restrained after running onto the pitch at full-time to confront Forest's Kelvin Wilson . It was an afternoon to forget for home supporters. Their team had surrendered a lead — anyone who has watched Derby this season will know that is a rarity — and lost to their worst enemy. Defeats cut deep and the strife between the two teams continues to grow year-on-year. The roots of this intense rivalry are said to lie in the Industrial Revolution when John Heathcoat from Derby invented a machine that copied hand-made lace but as soon as the patent ran out Nottingham entrepreneurs stole the idea. The hatred was famously stoked by Brian Clough. In 1983, Clough, in his time manager of both clubs but then at Forest, told defender Willie Young: ‘Just do one thing for me, Willie. Play well in this match and I won’t ask another thing of you.’ Forest's Ben Osborn (right) celebrates after scoring his side's winner in injury time . Charlton might be in disarray after the sacking of Bob Peeters, but Watford’s charge under Slavisa Jokanovic continues apace after a 5-0 thumping. Odion Ighalo, who spends his career out on loan from the Pozzo family-owned Udinese, scored twice, with Craig Cathcart, Troy Deeney and Daniel Tozser also finding the net. The Hornets are in the top six, winning five of their last seven Championship games. But Forest lost 2-0 — against a team led by Clough’s old ally Peter Taylor, no less — and the manager lost it in the dressing room. Derby players had been pelted with coins and bottles by fans that day and running battles broke out near the train station. Situations are more controlled now but for Forest manager Stuart Pearce this fixture takes on added importance, much in the same way as it did for Clough. Pearce is the man who says he is ‘entrenched’ in Nottingham and in 1989 claimed he’d rather sign on the dole than play for Derby. ‘No disrespect but I could never work for that club in any capacity.’ Stuart Pearce celebrates as Britt Assombalonga equalises for Nottingham Forest in the second-half . Britt Assombalonga celebrates after equalising for Nottingham Forest after 74 minutes . He was rather more dignified at the iPro Stadium on Saturday after seeing his players fight his corner after an impassioned speech in the hotel beforehand. ‘You’ve either got to play for me to hear a team talk or you’ve got to pay a lot of money to come and listen to me at a leadership conference!’ he smirked when asked to reveal what he said. ‘Otherwise I’m not telling you.’ Pearce might have been telling us the reasons for parting with Forest had he not conjured a response from his players. They’d won just twice since September and were continuing to stagnate with no signs of revival. After securing a late winner, for once Pearce didn’t need to go firefighting. Pearce was under intense pressure after a poor run of results that had seen them slip to 13th in the table . ‘In some ways we might have to build and emulate Derby,’ he said. ‘They are an outstanding side, built over five years, from Nigel Clough’s days. Steve (McClaren) has taken the team on and they are a very good side. They have a fantastic set-up at this club.’ Forest owner Fawaz Al-Hasawi found his tyres had been let down and a number plate ripped off his car afterwards. ‘I don’t mind at all. The three points are more important,’ was his response, though Forest may seek compensation for the damage. There was nothing deflating about the visitors, though, who showed they may have the guts to match their manager’s style. Pearce chose not to celebrate afterwards, adding: ‘I just go inside myself, enjoy the moment, then look to go and win a game on Wednesday. I don’t drink, I gave up 11 years ago.’ He could have done with a stiff one after hauling himself from the brink. Derby could count themselves lucky they were not behind early on. With the score at 0-0, Jake Buxton pulled Michail Antonio to the ground with a tackle more suited to the rugby field, but the referee gave nothing. WHAT'S CAUGHT MY EYE... Scunthorpe suffered the misfortune of losing first-choice goalkeeper Sam Slocombe to a broken arm in their 2-0 defeat against Bristol City, only to find substitute James Severn suffer the exact same fate before half-time. Defender Andrew Boyce ended up in goal for 48 minutes and City only scored their second late on. Yeovil have finally won a game. Their last victory came on December 13 but a winner from Gozie Ugwu, on his debut, saw Gary Johnson’s side record an impressive win against Bradford. Chant of the weekend has to go to the Oldham fans at Fleetwood Town. The hosts were mocked for their fishing heritage, with Latics supporters singing: ‘Pies are sustainable.’ It got worse for Graham Alexander’s Cod Army, who lost 2-0 and are in danger of falling away in mid-table.

"Tyson Fury believes a fight with Deontay Wilder would be even bigger than a clash between Floyd Mayweather Jnr and Manny Pacquiao. Wilder outclassed Bermane Stiverne in Las Vegas on Saturday night to be crowned America's first heavyweight world champion since 2006. He immediately targeted a fight with fellow motormouth Fury who admitted he would relish the challenge. Deontay Wilder saw off Bermane Stiverne to be crowned WBC heavyweight champion on Saturday . Wilder was untroubled for large parts of the fight but when he was caught, showed he could take a punch . Wilder runs to the ropes to celebrate after the final bell (left) and shows off his new WBC heavyweight belt . 'Wilder did a good job on Stiverne and he's now got the WBC title,' he said. 'That puts him in line for big fights against people like me, Wladimir Klitschko and whoever else. 'America has a new heavyweight champion of the world and the big boys are back in the division. The division has been set on fire again. 'It was definitely the result I wanted. Stiverne, although a good champion, was a bit of an unknown. Nobody knew who he was and nobody cared. Now America has a new heavyweight champion. Tyson Fury (right) - who Wilder wants to fight next - easily beat Derek Chisora in a world title bout in November . 'Also, Wilder's undefeated and a knockout artist. That means the division has been given a lift and we're all back in business. 'I don't like Deontay Wilder and he doesn't like me. I think he's a big hype-job. 'We once had a bit of a falling out in Sheffield at one of Mick Hennessy's boxing shows and I told him one day I will get him in the ring and knock him out. That is still my plan.' Fury is the mandatory challenger to world champion Wladimir Klitschko who holds the three other major belts. Fury celebrates beating Chisora for the WBO World Heavyweight Championship back in November . And he believes he will one day be crowned the undisputed heavyweight champion of the world. 'In an ideal world I'd like to fight Klitschko first, because he's got most of the belts and he's the No 1 in the division, and then I'd like to unify all the titles against Deontay Wilder,' Fury added. 'Potentially, I'm three or four fights away from being the unified heavyweight champion of the world. 'It would be the biggest selling fight with the greatest smack talk in heavyweight history. 'No other fight could come close to it. It would be pure entertainment. Wladimir Klitschko's last bout ended with a fifth-round knockout win over Kubrat Pulev in November 2014 . 'Back in the (Muhammad) Ali days, there was only one man doing the talking. The others wouldn't talk. This is different, though. We can both talk, we both play the press and we are both natural born entertainers. That's why it's the biggest fight out there as far as I'm concerned. 'It's not just the biggest fight in the heavyweight division, it's the biggest fight in world boxing. 'I'm a big puncher, he's a big puncher, and it's just a matter of who lands first. I wouldn't go out there to try and outbox somebody who is probably quicker than me. I'd go out there to switch his lights off. I'd look to demolish him early. 'There'd be a guaranteed knockout in the early rounds. Either way, it will be over very fast.'","Deontay Wilder outclassed Bermane Stiverne in Las Vegas on Saturday .

"FIFA president Sepp Blatter vowed at the IOC Congress in Monaco that he hasn’t seen the Michael Garcia World Cup bid corruption report which is causing so much controversy. Blatter’s aides are claiming only six people have seen the full 430-page findings. They are ethics judge Hans-Joachim Eckert and his deputy Alan Sullivan, investigator Garcia and his No 2 Cornel Borbely, plus Swiss attorney general Michael Lauber and Domenico Scala, FIFA’s compliance chief. However, such is Blatter’s control of world football’s ruling body that plenty of scepticism surrounds everything said on his behalf — especially when Garcia’s evidence of any wrongdoing during those murky 2018 and 2022 campaigns is of such importance to FIFA. Sepp Blatter insists that he hasn't seen the Michael Garcia report into World Cup bidding corruption . The 127th International Olympic Committee session taking place in Monaco this week . But Blatter — asked face to face by Sports Agenda during a break in the Congress to confirm what his Zurich advisors insisted was true — was adamant he had not been shown Garcia’s work. Blatter said: ‘I can confirm 100 per cent I have not seen the Garcia report. As I have said all along, the two ethics chambers act independently from FIFA.’ The FIFA farce continues with Zurich’s appeals committee due to hear Garcia’s complaint this week after he disowned Eckert’s summary conclusions as ‘materially incomplete’ and an ‘erroneous representations of the facts’. BT Sport have bizarrely followed arch-rivals Sky in naming dressage champion Charlotte Dujardin  as their sportswoman of the year, despite the more obvious claims of Olympic skeleton gold medallist Lizzy Yarnold and Jo Pavey, who won the European Championship 10,000 metres aged 40. The BBC’s far more relevant Sports Personality vote will have the last say on Sunday about who is the top British sportswoman of 2014. Charlotte Dujardin (centre) is presented with the BT sportswoman of the year award . Lizzy Yarnold won gold on the skeleton at the Winter Olympics in Sochi in February . Jo Pavey won the 10,000m at the European Championship in August aged 40 . The ECB have named Russell Evans and Paul Baldwin as new first-class umpires for 2015 despite an upcoming ageism employment case. Peter Willey and George Sharp have a tribunal date in February to contest being retired from the umpires roster against their wishes when in good health at the age of 65. The ECB say they took legal advice before publishing the umpire roster ahead of the tribunal. ............................................................................. West Bromwich Albion, who are joining Crystal Palace at a Premier League football festival in Mumbai this week to tap into the burgeoning Indian football market, are taking a lifesize silicon model of goalkeeper Ben Foster with them for promotional purposes. Neville’s decision time . The FA and Sky remain remarkably relaxed about Gary Neville combining his coaching and pundit roles — despite his Dog & Duck v Red Lion comments about Manchester United and Liverpool this week once again highlighting the conflict around England players. Neville is aware of the potential dangers, saying in his newspaper column: ‘I accept I am having my cake and eating it, with broadcasting and the England coaching role. 'That will end. I know the decision is looming. I committed to Sky for four years and Roy Hodgson for four years and I’m not stupid enough to think I will combine those functions for ever.’ The most likely outcome is that Neville tries his hand as a club manager after Euro 2016. Gary Neville said Manchester United's match against Liverpool on Sunday will be like a pub game . Neville (left) is still juggling his roles England coaching role with his media work at Sky Sports . There is considerable concern within grass-roots sport that the fall-out from Sport England’s botched Active People Survey will significantly affect budget plans for the financial year starting in April. Sports have been told by SE that the delay until January in receiving the amended APS figures, which are central to funding decisions, means the money handed out will not be announced until March 18, giving less than two weeks to put budgets in place. One chairman described the situation as a ‘complete shambles’.

"Alex Neil has warned Norwich he will demand full managerial control before committing his future to the Carrow Road club. Hamilton agreed compensation with the Canaries on Thursday to take their manager to the Championship. Neil, who caught the eye of the Norfolk club by leading Accies to promotion then to third in the Scottish Premiership, has already held preliminary discussions with the City board and will resume them on Friday. Alex Neil will only take the Norwich manager job if he is given full control . But although it’s widely anticipated that his move is a formality, the 33-year-old insists no club in the land could tempt him if he isn’t afforded full scope to do his job. ‘What has to happen is, when we discuss things, I’ve got to be happy with what the job description will be and what my role will be, in terms of how much power I’ll have,’ Neil said. ‘Because here at Hamilton the bottom line is I’ve got the decisions to make, I’m the decision maker and whatever comes or goes is through me.’ Asked about the increasing number of head-coach positions south of the border where player recruitment is done by someone else, Neil stated: ‘That won’t be the case. The bottom line is, if I’m a manager I’ll manage. I’m not going to be going for someone to tell me what to do — there’s no point in me going if that’ s the case. Neil Adams resigned on Monday after less than nine months in charge of the Championship club . ‘My description of a manager — and this is nothing to do with Norwich, just my description — is he is the guy that manages the team and any players that come or go. He’s the guy that makes the decision whether they come or go.’ Pressed if there was any suggestion that Norwich weren’t looking for a traditional manager, Neil retorted: ‘Not so far, whether that’s the case tomorrow (Friday), that’s how it might not happen. ‘Really tomorrow (Friday) will determine what will happen one way or the other. ‘It’s the full thing, the package has got to be right. I’m not going to uproot my family and move down there for an extra 20 quid. ‘And I’m not going to go down there to be dictated by someone else who will tell me what to do.’ The Hamilton manager, pictured during training on Monday, is set to hold more talks with Norwich on Friday . Barring a remarkable turn of events, however, confirmation of Neil replacing Neil Adams at Carrow Road will come later today. Accies vice-chairman Ronnie MacDonald believes Neil’s move to a side sitting just out-with the Championship play-offs positions further enhances his club’s reputation as a developer of people. ‘An amicable arrangement has been agreed and Alex can now go and discuss terms with them,’ he said. ‘We are delighted for Alex. He has been fantastic for us and is yet another Hamilton success story, whereby we have produced players, sports scientists, managers and coaches. ‘Alex is the latest one. We were lucky enough to have Billy Reid, who became manager of the year, and had the chance to go to Swansea. Neil is set to leave his role as player manager at Hamilton, the club where he has been for nearly 10 years . ‘We also had Graeme Jones here, who is now assistant to Roberto Martinez at Everton, and now Alex is the latest one. We wish him all the best.’ With Frankie McAvoy, who doubles as Accies’ academy director and Neil’s No 2, also expected to head south, MacDonald needs to find a temporary manager before the visit of Dundee United on Monday. Captain Martin Canning has been tipped to fill that post but MacDonald refused to speculate on a full-time successor. ‘It’s much too early to be thinking about a replacement,’ he added. ‘Les Gray, the chairman, is on holiday and when he gets back and it settles down there are a few things we want to tweak within the set-up.’","Norwich have agreed a compensation package with Hamilton for Alex Neil .

"Danny Cipriani and a host of talented youngsters are fighting an uphill battle for England recognition at clubs deemed unfashionable in the lower half of the Aviva Premiership, according to Mark Cueto. The veteran wing, who was part of the team which reached the World Cup final in 2007, believes his Sale team-mate and some rising stars at the club, along with others outside the title-chasing elite, struggle to force their way into Test contention. Earlier this month, Newcastle director of rugby Dean Richards suggested his in-form No 8 Mark Wilson would be playing international rugby by now if he were at a more ‘fashionable’ club. Danny Cipriani is struggling for England recognition despite his displays for Sale Sharks this season . No 8 Cipriani impressed during England's tour of New Zealand last summer . Cueto said: ‘Dean’s right. Naturally, if you are in a team which is winning more games than it is losing, then your job is a bit easier. You can generally put in better performances week after week, so naturally the teams at the top of the league attract more interest from England coaches. ‘Last year, there were rumours that James Gaskell and Rob Miller were told that moving to a more southern club would enhance their chances with England. I hope that isn’t the case because it would be absolutely horrific for a coach to say that.’ Cipriani has been left out of the latest England squad despite his stellar form this season and Cueto added: ‘Cips is a classic example. If he were at one of the top few clubs, no doubt there’s a lot more chance that he would be involved. ‘But regardless of how a club are performing, if a player is putting in outstanding performances every week, he’s got to be looked at, whether he’s playing at the top or the bottom of the league. ‘If anything, putting those performances in for a bottom-half-of-the-table team means he deserves a chance more than if he was at a top team. Veteran wing Mark Cueto (left) has accused England of ignoring players from unfashionable clubs . ‘There are a lot of things Cipriani can do which other 10s can’t, and he can do it when he’s on the back foot. He came away from that New Zealand tour last year with credit in the bank, but he still hasn’t been given a chance.’ Cipriani is waiting to discover if he will be in the revised England squad announced next Wednesday, as he weighs up whether to sign a new deal with Sale or explore the option of a move to Toulon. ‘The decision I make will not be based purely on England selection,’ he told BT Sport. ‘It’s a difficult decision that I have to make in the next couple of weeks.’ Sale have a number of promising rookies emerging this season, particularly teenage full back Mike Haley, wing Will Addison and No 8 Josh Beaumont. Cueto hopes this trio and others can go on to earn England call-ups and fulfil their potential, without having to move elsewhere. ‘Hopefully we can keep them and they can be the heart and soul of the club for years to come,’ he said. ‘But if players don’t feel the club are really investing and showing ambition, then they’re not going to stay around. Guys don’t just want to play for England, they want to be in the play-offs and win trophies.’ Josh Beaumont (left) is one of several players hoping to realise their England dreams at Sale . Youngsters Will Addison (left) and Mike Haley also deserve a call-up, according to Cueto . That is certainly the case for Newcastle’s England prop, Kieran Brookes, who has agreed to join champions Northampton in the summer. The Falcons are angry that the 24-year-old tighthead showed no desire even to consider staying at Kingston Park, where his career was resurrected following an ill-fated stint at Leicester. Richards said: ‘We’re obviously disappointed to see Kieran head to Northampton, as we would have liked him to stay here, at the club that has helped him to develop into the full England international he is today.’ London Irish confirmed that director of rugby Brian Smith has left his post and the Exiles are poised to announce Waikato Chiefs coach Tom Coventry as his successor.

"England No 8 Ben Morgan is set to see a specialist next week in the latest phase of his recovery from a broken leg.

But the World Cup on English soil later this year will remain a target for a player who shone for England during this season's autumn campaign. 'Surgery went well and was successful, and we will look at getting him in to see the specialist next Tuesday, so we will have a better idea then,' Gloucester rugby director David Humphreys said on Thursday. 'But, so far, the reports have been encouraging. 'The mental part is probably harder than the physical part. We all know that, in the game we play, one of the inevitable consequences for any player is that he will be injured. Although Morgan has been ruled out of the Six Nations, he is hopeful of returning for the World Cup . Morgan screams after scoring a try for England against Australia at Twickenham in November 2013 . 'I am sure it will be difficult for him to sit at home and watch the Six Nations, but he has a huge goal in front of him, which is the World Cup and preparing himself to be fit for that. 'I am not sure of the detail of the operation, and I think, at this stage, he has been given the best opportunity to get back fit as soon as possible.'

"A policeman who sexually assaulted an innocent man with a broomstick handle in the toilets of a New York police station has secretly married his 'childhood sweetheart' in prison - 13 years into his life sentence. Justin Volpe married Caroline Rose DeMaso in a simple ceremony at Florida's Federal Correctional Complex on May 13 this year, according to reports. But it will be a long wait before the couple . can consummate the marriage as conjugal visits are banned in Federal . prisons and Volpe is not due for parole until April 3 2025 at the . earliest. Volpe was jailed for 30 years in 1999 after he admitted dragging Haitian Abner Louima into the toilets of a Brooklyn police station and torturing him with the wooden implement following his arrest outside a nightclub. Just married: Justin Volpe, left, was jailed for 30 years in 1999 . after he admitted dragging Haitian Abner Louima, right, into the toilets of a police station and torturing him with a broom . Volpe then emerged from the bathroom holding a pair of blood-soaked leather gloves before declaring: 'I broke a man down.' But while the horrific and humiliating attack shocked America, sparking racial tensions across New York, Ms DeMaso could not let it cloud her love for the disgraced lawman. According to the New York Daily News, an unnamed source said the couple, who are both originally from Staten Island, had been childhood sweethearts but followed different paths. She then married a Brooklyn police officer, now with the city's mounted police division, who she later divorced. The couple were married in his Florida jail, registered by the federal Bureau of Prisons, on May 13 this year,  witnessed by Volpe’s mother, Grace, and a relative of the bride, the newspaper claimed. And far from the usual attire of top hats and tails, Volpe was forced to say 'I do' wearing his khaki prison clothes - emblazoned with his inmate number 49477-053 - and standard-issue training shoes. Simple ceremony: Volpe married 'sweetheart' Caroline Rose DeMaso at Florida's Federal Correctional Complex on May 13 this year. But he wasn't allowed to wear top and tails and conjugal visits are not allowed . He was, however, allowed to wear his new gold band back to his cell when the ceremony was over. 'It’s happened, thanks be to God,' the Reverend Thomas Devery, who presided over the nuptials, told the Daily News. 'They’re very happy, and that’s it.' Evidence: This photograph of Louima, introduced as evidence by the prosecution in Volpe's trial, was allegedly taken by police shortly after Louima was brutalized . Volpe was jailed for a minimum of 30 . years for the attack that left Louima with multiple injuries for which . he was hospitalised for two months. He later received an $8.7million . payout by the city. At first Volpe denied the assault, and even called on a colleague Charles Schwartz to testify on his behalf. Schwartz was convicted of perjury over the cover up and sentenced to serve five years. Volpe later admitted during his trial that he targetted Louima in retaliation for a punch thrown at his head in a brawl outside a nightclub in Flatbush. It later emerged another man had thrown the punch. Jailing him for 30 years Federal Judge Eugene Nickerson told the court: 'Short of intentional murder, one cannot imagine a more barbarous . misuse of power than Volpe's.' Volpe has since apologised for the assault which sparked a wave of racial tension in the city, again throwing the spotlight on the issue of racism within the force. Volpe claimed the attack was not racially motivated, pointing to the fact that he was at the time in a three-year cohabitational relationship with a black woman. Father of three Louima had moved to New . York from Haiti seven years before the attack. He used some of the . payout to pay for schooling for children in his homeland. He would not comment on the marriage. His lawyer, though, told the Daily News: 'What’s important is for . police officers throughout the country to be reminded of his 30-year . prison sentence, which demonstrates police officers will be held . criminally accountable for perpetrating criminal acts against innocent . victims.'","Justin Volpe married Caroline Rose DeMaso in a simple ceremony at Florida's Federal Correctional Complex on May 13 this year .

"Brendan Rodgers has boldly predicted Liverpool will be serious title challengers next year and wants a trophy this season to kick-start their push. Liverpool have started to show glimpses of the form that saw them compete with Manchester City last year and go into Saturday’s FA Cup fourth-round tie against Bolton having lost just one of their last 15 matches. A number of the signings Rodgers made last summer — Alberto Moreno, Lazar Markovic and Emre Can — have started to make a difference and the manager believes that augurs well. Brendan Rodgers has boldly predicted Liverpool will be serious title challengers next year . Rodgers said that once the signing made in the summer gel they will compete for the Premier League crown . Rodgers is adamant they will leave their inconsistencies behind in 2015-16 and wants to see his squad collect silverware. ‘The reality was with so many changes we were not going to win the league this season. We’ll be ready to challenge for the title next year,’ said Rodgers, who ruled Daniel Sturridge out of a return to action against Bolton. ‘This year was about targeting the top four and the cups. This squad has Premier League-winning capabilities. 'We have young players who can grow. A win in the cup would provide greater stimulus. You need ready-made quality as well, but this was the year for players to adapt and settle. Come the summer the period of integration will be complete and we can compete like we did last year for the title. Rodgers shakes hands with Jose Mourinho during their recent Capital One Cup clash at Anfield . Raheem Sterling in action against Chelsea in the Capital One Cup semi-final first leg at Anfield . ‘We’ve shown in the last 13 or 14 games the restructuring of the team to make us a creative threat is there.

The 30-year-old right back could return from a thigh problem against Bolton and Rodgers said: ‘He is happy to work with the club to find a solution to stay. He loves being here.’ Meanwhile, Parma president Ermir Kodra has said they were ‘very close’ to signing striker Mario Balotelli earlier this month.

"Reckless sightseers are risking their lives to take a peak at a collapsing coastal mansion - by walking up a huge landslide. Several tourists have been spotted clambering up a massive landslip which collapsed under the cliff top property. The home, Ridgemont House, has been left uninhabitable after a mass rock slide under its front garden at the 150ft Oddicombe Cliffs in Torquay, Devon. Disaster: The house is a death trap since the landslide underneath the front garden left it uninhabitable . Daredevils: reckless tourists were spotted (circled) climbing the 150ft cliff face to investigate the house . Tourist trap: people are using the mud at the front of Ridgemont House to climb up and take a peak inside . Concerned council chiefs have warned the public to steer clear of the doomed property that could come plunging down at any moment. Officials have been forced to rope off the entire home after the stress of the collapse caused the brick house to start falling down. But people have seen been spotted trying to access the fragile house - by walking UP the landslide from the beach. Local resident Charlotte Osborne, 15, snapped two people climbing up the cliff-face on Sunday afternoon as she took photos from a safe vantage point. Her mum Jenny said: 'We couldn't believe our eyes. We went to take photos of the house and saw people climbing up the rocks. Beauty spot: The house had a stunning view over the sea in Torquay before the land slide . Collapsing: The local council says that the house is in danger of plunging down the cliffs at any moment . 'I guess these people - we think it was a girl and a boy, perhaps in their late teens - were trying to see how high up the cliff face they could get. 'We couldn't believe how stupid they could be. They must have seen the warning sign. It was so dangerous. 'The sooner the house goes the better because people are going to look at it.' Ridgemont House has been at the centre of a bitter legal battle ever since it was deemed unsafe by a landslide one week after being sold at auction. The six-bedroom pile, just 50 yards from the cliff edge, was bought for £155,000 in February 2010 - via a telephone bid by a woman who had never been there. But the new owner later became engaged in a legal war with the builder who sold it to her - but a judge ordered her to pay him what she owed. A spokesman for Torbay Council said: 'We understand the privately-owned property is in a dangerous position and we would advise members of the public not to enter the site. 'The site is contained by fences and walls which can be reasonably expected to protect the public from danger. 'As further rocks falls occur, we anticipate the building will suffer further collapse.'","Locals have spotted tourists trying to get a peak inside Ridgemont House .

"The mother of a 15-year-old choirgirl who was stabbed to death by a jealous ex-boyfriend says she feels 'vindicated' after an inquest heavily criticised the police. Arsema Dawit was knifed more than 50 times by Thomas Nugusse in central London in June 2008, just three days after her 15th birthday. Her family had reported him to the police around five weeks before Arsema died, saying he had threatened to assault and kill her, but they did not feel their concerns were taken seriously enough. Tsehaynesh Medihani (left) the mother of Arsema Dawit (right), who was stabbed to death by her controlling boyfriend, said she felt 'vindicated' after an inquest heavily criticised the police . A jury at Southwark Coroner's Court today returned a verdict of unlawful killing and branded the police investigation ‘inadequate’. In a statement outside the court, Arsema's mother Tsehaynesh Medihani said she found it a comfort that people now knew her daughter's life could have been saved if the police had acted. She said: 'I have waited six long years for other people to find out the truth about the circumstances surrounding my daughter's tragic death. 'This case is not simply about a brutal and unforgivable murder, but why, despite me begging the police to save my daughter, the police failed to act. Arsema with her mother  on her 15th birthday, three days before she  was knifed to death by Thomas Nugusse . 'The jury, by their conclusions, have vindicated me and what I have been saying from the very beginning.' Arsema's family won the right to a full inquest  in 2012, two years after the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) found 'organisational failings' in the police's handling of the case . Mrs Medihani added: 'My beautiful Arsema had a great future ahead of her and big ambitions. We left a war zone and came to this country where I thought my children would be safe. 'Arsema was a loving daughter and sister. She was assaulted, harassed and terrorised by Thomas Nugusse, a man the police were informed was in his late 20s or early 30s. 'The police did nothing to stop Thomas Nugusse from carrying out his threats to kill Arsema just three days after her 15th birthday. Thomas Nugusse (left), who was 21 at the time of the killing, had met Arsema at St Michael’s Orthodox Church where they were both in the choir . CCTV footage shows Arsema being followed by her controlling ex-boyfriend in June 2008 . 'I have had an agonising four weeks reliving the nightmare of those last few weeks of my daughter's life. 'While the pain and loss of my daughter will never go away, I can take some comfort from the fact that the public now know the truth that Arsema's death was avoidable and that her life could have been saved if the police had acted.' Nugusse, who was 21 at the time of the killing, had met Arsema at St Michael’s Orthodox Church in Camberwell, south London, where they were both in the choir. After dating for two years Arsema broke up with Nugusse because of his jealous and controlling tendencies. In April 2008 he hit her in the face, leaving her with a black eye, for greeting a male school friend at McDonald’s. Nugusse then started stalking Arsema, sending threatening messages to her and her family. He texted her mother to say: ‘It doesn’t matter what you guys do, I’m going to find her anyway’. CCTV captured Nugusse leaving the block of flats moments after he killed Arsema. He disposed of his bloodstained long-sleeved t-shirt and made a 999 call from the Hungerford Bridge. During the chilling call Nugusse said: 'Okay I want to tell you that I, I had a fight with my girlfriend and I killed my girlfriend so, this is because of... because she cheating me, she had been with me, she been with me for two years.' Following her death the case was immediately referred to the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC), and an investigation was put on hold to allow for criminal proceedings. But the family were robbed of the chance of a full trial for Nugusse after he was left brain damaged when he attempted suicide in prison shortly after killing Arsema, meaning he was unfit to plead. An Old Bailey jury in May 2009 was not permitted to return conventional innocent or guilty verdicts and instead found that Nugusse had “committed the acts”. Arsema’s family made a formal complaint against the Metropolitan Police in July 2009, accusing the force of ignoring warnings that Nugusse was a danger.","Arsema Dawit, 15, was stabbed to death by Thomas Nugusse in June 2008 .

"Cambridge head coach Richard Money has called for home supporters to believe that his side can beat the mighty Manchester United in the FA Cup fourth round on Friday night. The lowest ranked team remaining in the FA Cup are determined to showcase their ability against the 11-time winners at The R Costings Abbey Stadium, which will be full to its 7,988 capacity. League Two Cambridge have big-match experience within the last 12 months, having twice won at Wembley - in the FA Trophy and a play-off final which secured a Football League return following a nine-year absence. Cambridge boss Richard Money is plotting an FA Cup shock against Manchester United . U's chief Money directs proceedings during training on Monday . Money's men are unbeaten in 2015 and defeated Newport County 4-0 on Saturday in an impressive showing which he hopes will give fans a fillip. 'I hope they come to the game full of optimism,' Money said. 'I hope they come to the game with some belief that Friday can be the one in one hundred days that we can cause an upset. 'We want everyone to embrace the evening and an opportunity to showcase not just the football club, but the city.' The fourth round clash at The R Costings Abbey Stadium is a 7,988 sell out . Manchester United's stars will have to use the basic away dressing room at the Abbey Stadium . Cambridge and Manchester United have met twice before, in a two-legged League Cup tie in 1991. Cambridge, who reached successive FA Cup quarter-finals in 1990 and 1991, drew the home leg, but had already lost 3-0 at Old Trafford. As well as the Wembley successes, Cambridge have players who have experienced major highs; Luke Chadwick claimed a Premier League winners' medal at Manchester United and Michael Nelson was part of the Kilmarnock side which won the Scottish League Cup ahead of Celtic. Money knows few teams in the world can live with Manchester United and players as talented as Wayne Rooney, Radamel Falcao and Angel di Maria, so will focus only on what his men can do. Louis van Gaal, his backroom staff and the United subs will be housed on the run down visiting bench . 'I don't think you can think too much about who the individuals are going to be, because they have a plethora of incredible talent, any of whom could play this Friday,' Money added. 'The only thing you can plan for is how you think they're going to play and that's what we'll be focusing on, and, in the main, focusing on what we can do.' There is a financial benefit to the League Two side. Cambridge will earn £144,000 from the tie being televised. Cambridge trio Josh Coulson, Ian Miller and Tom Champion take a selfie with the FA Cup . The dream scenario would be a win, or a draw and a replay at Old Trafford which would bolster the coffers, but chief executive Jez George merely hopes the hosts can expand their fan-base by performing well. George said: 'When you put it into the context of this club losing money consistently for the last 10 years, it's going to be a big help for us to move towards a little bit of financial stability and help us grow a little bit quicker than perhaps we would've done otherwise. 'We need to make sure we have crowds that are better between now and the end of the season, more season ticket holders next year and the journey the club's been on the last 18 months can be accelerated.'","Cambridge take on Manchester United in the FA Cup on Friday night .

"The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge could tour China next year in a bid to help repair the damage caused by Prince Charles's diary description of Chinese officials as 'appalling old waxworks'. Discussions are currently underway for the historic tour which would take place following the completion of Prince William's training for his new job as a pilot for the East Anglican air ambulance. It is not only seen as a diplomatic coup for the Foreign Office but also an important step to help repair the ill will felt towards the royals after Prince Charles' diary entries, published by the Mail on Sunday in 2006, described Chinese officials as 'appalling old waxworks'. The Duke and Duchess would visit next year following Prince William's training for his new piloting job. The couple are pictured here with their son George during the royal tour of Australia and New Zealand . This year's tour of Australia and New Zealand proved to be massively successful. The couple, along with their son Prince George, were greeted by huge crowds throughout the tour and it contributed to a significant surge in the royal family's popularity. Kensington Palace said: 'Next year's tours for the Duke and Duchess are currently being considered, discussed and assigned. They will be announced in due course.' The Sunday Times also reported a spokesperson as saying China was 'looked at regularly because it is an important country that the Foreign Office want to send them to'. The paper said officials hoped to capitalise on the current goodwill felt towards the couple. Relations between Britain and China have been strained since a diplomatic row broke out in 2012 when Prime Minister David Cameron met the Dalai Lama. Prince Charles (left) former Governor Chris Patten (centre) and former Prime Minister Tony Blair at the 1997 Hong Kong handover ceremony - when sovereignty of Hong Kong was handed from Britain to China . The Foreign Office also hopes to take advantage of the couple's widespread popularity . The 2012 meeting between the Dalai Lama, David Cameron and Nick Clegg which sparked a diplomatic row . At the time, China's foreign ministry said the May 2012 meeting between the exiled Tibetan leader, Cameron and Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg had ‘seriously interfered with China’s internal affairs’. The Dalai Lama has lived in exile in India since fleeing his Tibetan homeland in 1959 after a failed uprising against Communist rule. The paper reported the tour would not take place until after Prince William has completed five months of training for his new job as a pilot with the East Anglican air ambulance. Last summer Kensington Palace announced that the prince had decided to quit the military after seven years’ service, two-and-a-half of which were as a Search and Rescue pilot at RAF Valley on Anglesey. He takes up the new job in spring next year and plans to donate his £40,000 salary to charity.

The mosaic took three months to create and is made up of more than 5,000 tiles. It will be auctioned for local charities later this month at a Vegas Fight Night and Kennedy would love nothing more than a bid from the man himself. 'I'm a massive fan of all sports, but my dad is the big boxing fan in our family; I made this for him,' he said. 'He believes Floyd is the greatest boxer in the world. If Floyd was to bid on the mosaic it would be fantastic. He needs a bit of Mancunian art in his world!

"Rear Admiral Carlos Busser who led the Argentine invasion of the Falkland Islands has died of a heart attack . The Argentine commander who led the invasion of the Falklands Islands has died of a heart attack in Buenos Aires. Rear Admiral Carlos Busser commanded the Argentine Marines Fifth battalion during 'Operation Rosario' to capture the Islands In April 1982. As the . highest ranking officer to set foot on the Falklands he ordered his troops to surround Government House in Stanley before demanding the surrender of the then governor Sir Rex Hunt. Outnumbered Royal Marines shot dead an Argentine navy officer during a brave attempt to . defend the disputed territory shortly before the April 2 1982 . surrender. Busser, 84, died after suffering a heart attack at his home in the Argentine capital on Saturday night. He had been under house arrest since 2009 over alleged human rights abuses at Argentina's main naval base Puerto Belgrano in the 1970s. Prosecutors had accused him of involvement in the torture and disappearance of three men including an ex-intelligence officer said to have been tortured into confessing he was a Chilean spy. Sir Rex Hunt summoned Rear Admiral Busser . to negotiate after the Argentines took control of the island airstrip . and surrounding Government House. He . told him: 'This is British territory. You're not invited. We don't want . you here. I want you to go now and take all your men with you.' The 84-year-old had been under house arrest since 2009 over alleged human rights abuses at Argentina's main naval base Puerto Belgrano in the 1970s . Royal Marines surrender to Argentine soldiers under the command of Rear . Admiral Busser after a brave attempt to defend the islands . Busser replied: 'I've got 800 men ashore and another 2,000 waiting to land. 'We didn't think you'd resist. Tell your men to lay down their arms before we cause casualties.' The following day Argentina sent troops to capture and occupy South Georgia and the uninhabitated South Sandwich islands. Governor . Hunt and officials from the Foreign Office were forcibly evicted from . the Falklands by the Argentine forces and sent to the Uruguayan capital . Montevideo.

Busser, speaking of the Falklands in an interview with an Argentine newspaper several years ago, said: 'I think the decision to recover the Falkland Islands was correctly adopted by the Argentine government. 'If we subsequently committed errors and lost the war, that doesn't detract from the message Argentina always sent the British government about our determination to capture the islands.'","Rear Admiral Carlos Busser commanded the Argentine Marines Fifth battalion during 'Operation Rosario' in April 1982 .

"A teenage girl claims she was set up by BBC producers after unwittingly taking part in a documentary about bad driving. Amy Smith, 18, said she was tricked into taking part after responding to an advert asking for ‘fun and confident groups of friends’. The former private schoolgirl said she signed up believing it would be a reality TV series similar to ITV’s The Only Way Is Essex. Scroll down for trailer . 'Fooled': Amy Smith, 18 from Halifax, West Yorkshire, thought the BBC was filming her every day life for a glamorous reality television show, when they were in fact documenting her bad driving . But to her horror, she was actually . being filmed for a documentary about bad teenage driving - with cameras . capturing her every mistake on the road. Her blunders will now be exposed in a series called Barely Legal Drivers, beginning tonight (April 2) on BBC3. The BBC admitted she was tricked into . taking part but said she signed a consent form after she found out the . real aim of the programme. But Miss Smith said she only realised when she saw the programme’s trailer last week how stupid she had been made to look. BBC producers told her she needed a . car for the programme, so despite having only just passed her test, she . borrowed one especially. She was filmed on glamour modelling . auditions and going shopping - but it was only at the end of the week . that producers revealed the programme would focus on her driving. She said: ‘I’ve been set up. They’ve . made me look really stupid. I couldn’t understand why they kept wanting . me to get in the car and drive all these far distances. They’re not . journeys I would ever normally do.’ Films of Miss Smith driving were shown . to her mother and to a former traffic officer to comment on - with . prizes of a car or advanced driving lessons awarded according to . performance. Total control: The producers of Barely Legal Drivers has hit back at Amy's claims saying that not only were her parents aware of the concept throughout their filming, Amy also signed a release form . The youngster, who had never been on a motorway, is shown stopping on a sliproad while cars came past at 70mph. During another trip, she skips a red light and is almost hit by a bus as she makes a right turn in its path. 'I’ve been set up. They’ve made me look really stupid. I couldn’t understand why they kept wanting me to get in the car and drive all these far distances. They’re not journeys I would ever normally do' Amy Smith . She added: ‘I thought it was going to be like The Only Way Is Essex, but I was never filmed having my nails or hair done. ‘That week was hell. I’m not a diva, . I’m easy going and can take a lot of stress but at the end I lost my . temper and was in tears. ‘I had no idea I would be driving to . these venues or that they would be filming me on the way. If I had known . it was about driving I would never have taken part.’ Miss Smith signed up with producers after spotting an advert on a talent scouting website for a programme called ‘We Are Young’. It read: ‘We will be following the day . to day lives of a select number of teenagers exploring the modern world . from the eyes of the young’. The beauty student signed up after an . interview with producers at Renegade Pictures, which made the film for . the BBC, and agreed to be filmed for a week last October. Miss Smith and her mother both signed consent forms when the premise of the film was explained to them. 'She never bought into a driving programme. It was supposed to be all about filming her with her friends on a night out' Lisa Smith . Her mother, Lisa, 47, was told about . it at the beginning of the filming and said she played along because of . the prizes promised. However, they say it was only last . week when they saw the trailer that they realised how irresponsible the . teenage drivers were portrayed to be. The title had been changed from ‘We . Are Young’ to ‘Barely Legal Drivers’ and footage of Miss Smith’s . mistakes are spliced in with that of other teenagers behaving badly. One teenager in the trailer admits she drives best ‘while tipsy’ while another teenager blows up a condom while driving. Comparison: She said she imagined it would be a reality TV series similar to  The Only Way Is Essex - which featured (left to right) Bobby, Ricky, Lauren, Billie, Arg, Joey, Mick, Mario, Chloe, Cara and Lucy in series seven . Mrs Smith, a car saleswoman, said: . ‘She never bought into a driving programme. It was supposed to be all . about filming her with her friends on a night out. ‘They were putting words in to her . mouth all the time. Her driving mistakes were made out of inexperience . but her attitude was bang on. They were pushing her into making . mistakes.’ 'We are surprised Amy is saying these things as once the real purpose of the show had been revealed she was happy to sign the release form and she has also seen highlights of the show' BBC spokesman . Last night, the BBC said she had been asked to go on ‘three normal journeys’ and denied there had been pressure from producers. A spokesman said: ‘As with many . documentaries the final title is not confirmed until nearer the . transmission so “We are Young” continued to be the working title. ‘We are surprised Amy is saying these . things as once the real purpose of the show had been revealed she was . happy to sign the release form and she has also seen highlights of the . show. ‘She is on camera talking about how much she enjoyed the advanced driving lessons. In addition the consent forms the . parents were asked to sign are so thorough they leave no doubt as to . what the real programme is about.’","Amy Smith, 18, claims BBC 'set her up' with promises of TOWIE-style show .

"Heavy metal musician Steve Harris is selling his plush 11-bed mansion - which comes complete with a full-sized football pitch, its own pub and an ornate swimming pool. The Iron Maiden bass guitarist, who has owned Sheering Hall - set in nine acres of grounds in Sheering, Essex - since the 1980s, has put it on the market for £4.95m. The 58-year-old, considered one of the best heavy metal bassists in the world and who was scouted by West Ham when he was a youngster, is a keen footballer and even has his own team, the Maidonians. Scroll down for video . The £5million 11-bedroom mansion has parts which date back to the 14th century and sits on nine acres of land in Sheering in Essex . Iron Maiden bassist Steve Harris has reduced the price of his mansion by some £2 million to secure a buyer for the luxury property . The house is ideal for anyone who is sporting mad as among its many features is a full size football field on the nine acres of land . The property is being sold by Iron Maiden bass guitarist Steve Harris, pictured, who is a serious West Ham fan . The Grade II-listed house has its own recording studio, tennis court, arcade area and gym as well as a 'pub' called the Horse and Cart. The pub, installed by the bassist, comes complete with ales on tap as well as a vast selection of spirits, pool table and bar stools. Estate agents Dreampad boast that the plush home is a 'substantial Grade II listed building' with 11,000 sq ft of floorspace and a full-sized 11-a-side football pitch - with home and away dressing rooms - in its grounds. It states: 'There has been a house on the site since the Domesday Book and parts of the house date back to 1427. 'Nestled amid rolling farmland this nine acre estate is approached by a pretty private lane. 'The property boasts a wealth of period wood panelling and exposed original beams and flooring, various outbuildings to include a 3 bed coach house and 2 bed apartment and a wealth of leisure facilities, including a heated indoor swimming pool, floodlit tennis court and 11-a-side football pitch, with home and away dressing rooms. For those who do not fancy the beautiful game, the property also features a flood-lit tennis court in case of a fifth set tie-break . Unsurprisingly for an 11-bed mansion, the kitchen features acres of space for food preparation with an Aga and marble counter tops . There are solid oak beams throughout the £5 million property as well as wood-paneled walls and several reception rooms for entertaining . The blurb states the the pub even has a range of ales on tap, adding: 'Through a further hallway is access to your own private and fully equipped pub the 'Horse and Cart' complete with ale on tap. 'From the second hallway, further leisure amenities extend to an impressive media room again with a high ornately decorated ceiling, an office and editing studio. 'A second staircase leads to the bespoke indoor heated swimming pool with raised gym area, two separate recreational areas, changing room, separate kitchen and impressive split level galleried studio. 'From the entrance hall the main wood panelled staircase leads up to the first floor with the principal bedroom, dressing room & en suite bathroom, there are nine further bedrooms, a family bathroom and three shower rooms as well as staff accommodation consisting of bedroom, shower room, sitting room and kitchen which can also be accessed by the second staircase.' If staying in is the new going out, this house allows you the best of both worlds with its own fully-stocked bar with pool table . If the new owner spends too long in the kitchen or the bar they will be able to work off all of those calories the following day . If pumping iron is too energetic, there is a rather ornate heated indoor swimming pool . It adds: 'Approached via a pretty country lane and accessed via a private gated entrance into a sweeping gravel driveway with large parking area, Sheering Hall is a substantial Grade II listed house of historical importance with some 11,000 sq. ft. full of character and period features throughout. 'The property offers a fantastic variety of facilities for entertaining on a grand scale and has secondary glazing throughout. 'Surrounding the original medieval entrance hall with its exposed beams and open fireplace are the three main reception rooms. 'The sitting room and drawing room both benefit from fine detail and character with floor to ceiling oak panelled walls and high ceilings with gilded ornate cornicing.' The property, which was first put on the market for £7m in 2012, even has a red BT phone box on its driveway. Local David Harding said: 'Steve's not around here so much these days as he's always abroad - he's been here a long while and it will be sad to see him finally go. 'Whoever buys this place needs to enjoy football, tennis and swimming - and spending every night in their own pub. What more could anyone want? 'He had it on the market for £7m a couple of years ago, but obviously wants rid of it and has put the price down a couple of million. I can't afford it though, sadly.' The bedrooms are suitably ornate with four-poster beds and even a fire place in the corner for that added romantic touch . The site where the Grade-II listed building was built was first mentioned in the Doomsday book although the oldest parts date to 1427 . The house is close to Stansted Airport. It is also beside the M11 motorway and is only about an hour's journey from London by train .","Iron Maiden bassist Steve Harris is selling his luxury Essex mansion for £5million, slashing £2million from the price .

"The parents of a 13-year-old schoolgirl who died from a brain aneurism have published her private diaries. Jemima Layzell collapsed suddenly at home in Horton in Somerset and later died in hospital having suffered a massive bleed on her brain in March last year. She had expressed a wish for her organs to be donated and they were used to save the lives of eight others, as well as the sight of three people. Angelic: The diaries of Jemima Layzell, who died suddenly last year at the age of 13, have been published into a book called The Draft by her parents Harvey, 44, and Sophy, 39, from Horton, Somerset . After her death, Jemima's parents . Harvey, 44, and Sophy Layzell, 39, discovered her private diaries, which . she started writing aged four, in her bedside cabinet. Jemima had dreamed of becoming a writer when she grew up, so her parents decided to try to publish the diaries. Her . writing has now been made into a book, called The Draft, which has . attracted praise from distinguished children's authors Dame Jacqueline . Wilson and Michael Morpurgo. Moving: The Draft is a collection of Jemima's most intimate thoughts, and her writing has been praised by leading authors Dame Jacqueline Wilson and Michael Morpurgo . Mr . Layzell, a photographer, said the family wanted to raise awareness of . organ donation and children hearing voices through the book. He . said: 'We are exceedingly proud seeing Jemima's own words in print . especially as most of it has never been read during her lifetime. 'Sharing . her private thoughts could be thought of as quite invasive but we . decided to publish Jemima's diaries not just because she was so talented . but also to raise awareness of such things as hearing voices. 'As . a daughter she was diligent, conscientious and always strived to make . us so proud. She was gifted creatively and enjoyed analysing and . questioning the world around her. 'She loved playing make believe with her sister and her favourite thing was hanging out with her friends."" Jemima's . sister, Amelia, 12, will receive half of profits from The Draft, with . the rest going towards setting up a charitable trust in her name. The . teenager collapsed at home without warning during evening preparations . for Mrs Layzell's 38th birthday party on March 10 last year. She . lost consciousness and was taken to Musgrove Park Hospital in Taunton . in Somerset, and later transferred to Frenchay Hospital in Bristol.

Three people have also had their sight saved. Thoughtful: Jemima also helped save the lives of eight people through the donation of her organs . Jemima's book, The Draft, went on sale on May 21 - what would have been her 15th birthday. It begins: 'This diary belongs to Jemima Elizabeth Layzell. If I were a fairy I'd be called Lizzy Stardust.' The intimate diaries share her . thoughts about love, friendship and the future - with her secret wish . 'for someone to really, really like me for who I am'.

They are there to stop us from turning into complete monsters before it’s too late.Sunday 7th August 2011 . Anyway I need to write what I think and feel. Not all that you see here actually ‘happened’ but it’s still very real to me. I don’t care if I let my imagination run away with me! Plenty of brilliant artists and writers were mad! In fact it made their work more interesting! Even if they did cut their ears off, commit suicide, run round doing crazy stuff etc etc. People still loved them and their work just the same. And I want to be loved too. I almost feel as though I will never live long enough to become an author, to be married and have a family. 'They . are there because we have a wrong to right. They are there to stop us . from turning into complete monsters before it's too late.' Mr . Morpurgo, author of War Horse, said: 'We all have our stories to tell. This is Jemima's first and last and because of that so important to all . of us who read it now. This is her life.' Ms . Wilson also said: 'I think it's the most beautiful, touching, . heart-breaking book.

"American pit bulls (stock image of breed above) are banned in the UK under The Dangerous Dogs Act 1991 . The relatives of a baby girl mauled to death by her grandmother's illegal pet dog have paid tribute to their 'little princess' as police continue to investigate the tragedy. The six-month-old was savagely killed last week by an American pit bull at her grandmother's house while she was being looked after in Daventry, Northamptonshire. The breed of dog is banned under the Dangerous Dogs Act 1991 which prohibits the ownership of animals bred for their fighting abilities. Today the baby's family released a statement in which they said they were 'devastated' by their loss. 'The family wish to say at this point that we are totally devastated and in complete shock for the tragic loss of our little princess and ask that we are left alone to grieve at this horrific time.' It came after Northamptonshire Police revealed the dog's breed following a post-mortem examination. Chief Inspector Tom Thompson  said: 'We can today reveal the outcome of that post mortem has shown the dog was an American pit bull, a prohibited breed under the 1991 Dangerous Dogs Act. 'This continues to be a complex and highly unusual investigation which has required significant resource within Force and drawn on national expertise in the area of dangerous dogs. 'But at the heart of it is a baby girl whose life has tragically been taken away in the most horrific of circumstances.' Mr Thompson would not reveal whether anyone had been arrested in connection with the baby's death, adding: 'Extensive inquiries are taking place to ascertain if any offences have occurred. 'In addition to our ongoing investigation, we have been concentrating our efforts on providing support for a grieving family who have been left devastated by this. 'The family have made it very clear that they do not want us to name their child. We must remember that they're grieving, they're in shock. 'They have lost a child in the most tragic circumstances and we really must respect their wishes.' An inquest into the infant's death will be held next week. Scroll down for video . The six-month-old girl was being cared for by her maternal grandmother at her home in Daventry (pictured) when the animal attacked . Tragic: Neighbours laid flowers outside the home where the woman is thought to have kept two dogs . Chief Inspector Tom Thomspon spoke of the 'horrific circumstances' in which the girl died last Friday . Questions have been raised after it emerged Daventry District Council visited the property following complaints from neighbours. Officials took no further action after deciding the animals' barking was not too loud. Neighbour Carol Watts, 68, said: 'The council was fully aware of the this dog. Why was nothing done? 'Surely they communicate with police, especially if they find a banned breed at a house. 'This tragedy could have been avoided. It's as simple as that.' Councillor Chris Over, from Daventry District Council, said the death was a 'wake-up call' to bring back dog licensing. He added: 'This is shocking. This is a terrible situation - the trauma for the family must be awful and our hearts go out to them. 'It is a wake-up call for people to make certain that when they select a dog it is a breed that has a good reputation and that they are able to control the dog.' The Dangerous Dogs Act was introduced in 1991 as a means of keeping vulnerable people and children safe from animals. Prohibited breeds are so because they have been bred for their abilities to fight. Among them  is the pit bull terrier, the Japanese tosa, and any other considered by the Secretary of State to have been bred for fighting. Banned breeds cannot be kept, bred, sold or exchanged under the law.  Anyone who owns a banned breed cannot take it out in public without a muzzle. If a person commits an Dangerous Dogs related offence, they can be disqualified for dog ownership and be ordered to have the animal put down. Earlier neighbours described the animals as 'devil dogs'. 'You could hear the dogs killing each other fighting non-stop in the house from 100ft away inside our house,' one said. 'They were screeching, growling and barking all the time. It was terrifying, they are known as the devil dogs. 'One of the ladies who complained said she was worried her two young children would be killed if they escaped. 'You see all the emergency services there and you really feel for the family. 'But at the end of the day if something had been done and the complaints were listened to then that little girl might still be alive.' Daventry District Council officials visited the property once after complaints over noise. A spokesman said: 'We received one noise complaint in May from a neighbour relating to two dogs barking at the property. 'As with all such complaints, we spoke to the owners of the dogs who acted to control the noise to a reasonable level. 'We have not received any other complaints relating to these dogs. 'We always encourage anyone with concerns about the safety of any dog to report them to us or the police.'","Northamptonshire Police confirmed the animal was an American pit bull .

"Andros Townsend has made a surprising defence of Emmanuel Adebayor by claiming Tottenham’s controversial striker is working hard. Townsend praised his team-mate’s performance in the Capital One Cup win over League One Sheffield United on Wednesday, saying: ‘Emmanuel played well and hopefully he can get another run out on Saturday and get a goal. He’s a fantastic player. He worked hard and hopefully fans can see that. ‘The 60-odd minutes he played on Wednesday he worked extremely hard and that’s all we can judge him on.

Townsend celebrates after scoring a penalty to give Spurs a 1-0 win over Sheffield United at White Hart Lane . Emannuel Adebayor returned to Tottenham's starting line-up against Sheffield United in the League Cup . ‘The manager’s picked him to start because he’s got his head down and showed he deserves to be in the squad. He’s got himself fit and he got his reward.’ Tottenham fans were shocked when manager Mauricio Pochettino made Adebayor captain against Sheffield United. The striker, who had not started a game for two months through a combination of illness, injury and compassionate leave, did little to justify the armband before being booed by fans when substituted after 64 minutes. It was the second successive game in which Adebayor was jeered by his own fans and he admitted after his substitute appearance against Sunderland he was not at White Hart Lane to endear himself to supporters. He alienated them again on Wednesday and managed to hit his two shots well wide. But Townsend, who scored a penalty to give his side a 1-0 advantage for next week’s second leg at Bramall Lane, said Adebayor is ‘a great player to have’. ‘He’s a funny character: always joking, always dancing,’ said Townsend, ‘He’s a great guy to have around, a fantastic character.’ It was a frustrating night in front of goal for Adebayor, who was substituted with 25 minutes left to play .

"Luis Enrique has backed out-of-sorts striker Luis Suarez to find his form in front of goal after a slow start to his Barcelona career, insisting he has 'total confidence' in the former Liverpool hitman. The Uruguay international, who moved from Merseyside to the Nou Camp for £70million in the summer, drew anther blank on Wednesday night as Barcelona recorded a narrow victory against Atletico Madrid in the first leg of the Copa del Rey quarter-final. Suarez, who has only scored five goals since the big-money move, missed a gilt-edged chance to give Barcelona the lead in the first half against Atletico but somehow managed to fire over from five yards out.

"Just 12 months ago, a 15-year-old Martin Odegaard was in the middle of his final year at school, worrying how we would fit in his exams around training with his local football team in Norway. Now the footballing prodigy, who turned 16 last month, has signed for Real Madrid and will play alongside the likes of Cristiano Ronaldo and Gareth Bale. 2014 was a whirlwind year for Odegaard, who rose from life as a schoolboy to being the youngest player to ever represent his nation before signing a £40,000-a-week deal with the European champions this week. Scroll down for video . Martin Odegaard, 16, has signed for Real Madrid, but just months ago he was fitting his secondary school studies around playing for his local team in Norway . Odegaard holds his shirt after being unveiled as a Real Madrid player, where he will be paid £40,000 a week . Odegaard's proud family were at the signing at the Bernabeu stadium as he was announced as a Real Madrid player . Schoolboy to football star: Martin Odegaard, pictured with his brother, rose through the academy of his local team in Norway but now plays for the European champions . Odegaard became the youngest ever player to turn out for the Norwegian national side last year, just months after he made his first professional appearance in the Scandinavian nation's premier league . Odegaard was brought up in the small riverside city of Drammen in a strong Christian family, with the teenager often expressing his faith on Twitter. He played for the youth team at his local team Strømsgodset, where his father used to play, who accommodated his studies around playing football. Odegaard always stood out from children his own age and started training with the adult side, who play in the Norwegian premier league, when he was just 13. It was not long before his talent was noticed by prestigious clubs in Europe, with the teenager training with Manchester United and Bayern Munich. Aged 15 years and 117 days, the attacking midfielder made history by becoming the youngest player to take to the field in a Norwegian premier league match, in April. Just weeks later, after signing his first professional contract, he broke more records by becoming the youngest playing to score in the league.

Just weeks after signing his first professional contract, Odegaard broke more records by becoming the youngest player to score in the league. Here he is pictured bottom left bowling with friends . Odegaard (pictured left in both photos) has also made three appearances for the Norwegian national team . The Norwegian sensation answered only in Norwegian during his press conference in Madrid yesterday, but will be joined at the Spanish club by his father who was also signed as a coach . Odegaard celebrates scoring for Stromsgodest in Norway in May 2014 at the age of just 15 . But bigger things beckoned for Odegaard, who has since made three appearances for the Norwegian national football team. Norway's manager Per-Mathias Høgmo recently told Aftenposten: 'He has developed enormously in a short time. He brought down barriers that I think neither he nor anyone else imagined would fall. 'His way of playing, his talent, his ability to make choices and think, all of this is impressive,"" he added.' Even his own father Hans Erik said it was a only a matter of time before a big team on the continent tried to sign the 16-year-old. There were suggestions Odegaard could be moving to England after he trained with his favourite team Liverpool, as well as Manchester City and Arsenal. Celtic, Dutch club Ajax, Bayern Munich and Real Madrid all courted the growing talent, who eventually went for Madrid - who have also signed his father as a coach as part of the deal. Aged 15 years and 117 days, the attacking midfielder made history by becoming the youngest player to take to the field in a Norwegian premier league match . Odegaard has played three times for Norway, including in a 2016 European Championship qualifier against Bulgaria . Odegaard will be paid £40,000 a week, which could rise to £80,000 when bonuses are added - small fry compared to some Real Madrid players but a huge sum of money for a teenager. Despite the money and new-found fame, the 16-year-old is keeping his feet on the ground and will play for the Spanish team's reserve side for the time being, which is managed by French World Cup winner Zinedine Zidane. Odegaard said: ‘Madrid had the best conditions for me to develop and my aim now is to become the best player I can. ‘It’s a big advantage for me that Real Madrid have a B team playing in a very competitive league and are managed by someone who was one of the best players in the world.’ Speaking of his new team mate before picking up the Ballon d'Or award, Cristiano Ronaldo said: 'A good player. I think he's a young boy, he can still grow. 'He has a good future ahead. So we must give him time to learn, to take the best decisions but I see a lot of potential in that player. A good left foot.'","A year ago Martin Odegaard was finishing his secondary school exams .

"ITV political editor Tom Bradby has reason to question the spelling ability of American Twitter users after his feed on the  site was swamped with abuse by people who'd confused him with NFL star Tom Brady, who's at the center of  so-called 'deflategate'. New England Patriots star Brady is busy deflecting allegations that his team used deliberately deflated balls to gain an advantage over the Indianapolis Colts on Sunday, who they beat to win a place in the Super Bowl. Thousands have taken to Twitter to voice their opinion about the matter, but many have tweeted abuse at ITV's presenter instead of the NFL star, who isn't on the social media site. Scroll down for videos . ITV's Tom Bradby (pictured with his wife, Claudia) has been mistaken on Twitter for NFL star Tom Brady (pictured right with his wife, Gisele Bundchen) Bradby was inundated to the extend that he felt the need to publicly address the issue and ponder whether he should write to Brady to tell him to sign up to Twitter. He wrote on Facebook on Thursday 'how many Americans can't spell?' and then pasted hundreds of messages below directed at him by NFL fans. He added: 'This is my timeline on Twitter this morning. Or, to be more accurate, just a part of it. It goes on and on and on, pages and pages and pages of it. Something to do with deflated balls apparently... 'I am considering two courses of action - writing to Tom Brady, star quarterback of the Patriots, to ask him to please get onto Twitter so I don't have to read all the abuse meant for him any more or sponsoring a new American spelling bee. Feel free to tell me which you would recommend.' Brady became implicated in the scandal when New England Patriots coach Bill Belichick told the media they should address comments they have about the footballs to Brady. 'I think we all know that quarterbacks, kickers, specialists have certain preferences on footballs. They know a lot more about it than I do. They're a lot more sensitive to it than I am,' he explained. 'I hear them comment on it from time to time, but I can tell you and they will tell you that there is never any sympathy whatsoever from me on that subject. Zero. Tom's personal preferences on his footballs is something he can talk about in much better detail and information than I can possibly provide.' New England Patriots head coach Bill Belichick talks to the media during a press conference to address the under inflation of footballs . If, for any reason, anyone on the Patriots is found to have anything to do with Sunday's underinflated balls, they would face up to a $25,000 fine . On Thursday Brady and Patriots Belichick both appeared on nationally televised press conferences to rebut the claims as the controversy swirling around America's biggest sporting event reached fever pitch. NFL chiefs are probing allegations that balls used by the Patriots offense in their 45-7 rout of the Indianapolis Colts on Sunday were inflated below standard league levels - giving Brady and his team-mates an advantage by making them easier to handle. But Brady, one of the scandal-tainted NFL's biggest stars, flatly denied any involvement in the scandal dubbed 'deflategate.' 'I didn't alter the balls in any way,' said Brady, who is preparing for a record sixth Super Bowl in Arizona on February 1. 'I feel like I have always played within the rules. I would never break the rules,' added Brady, a three-time Super Bowl winner and two-time NFL Most Valuable Player. Brady's comments echoed those made earlier in the day by Belichick, who said he was 'shocked' to learn of the possibly illegal footballs on Monday. 'I have never talked to any player, staff member about football air pressure,' Belichick said. 'To me, the footballs are approved by the league and game officials pre-game, and we play with what's out there.' Brady had originally laughed off the suggestion of wrongdoing by the Patriots in a radio appearance on Monday, thinking it was 'sour grapes.' By Thursday, the 37-year-old superstar was aware of the magnitude of the issue. 'It's very serious,' Brady said. 'Obviously, integrity of the sport is very important.' However, he added that he believed he and the Patriots would get through it. 'Things are going to be fine,' he said. 'This isn't ISIS. No one's dying,' he said, referring to the militant group waging war in Iraq and Syria. Although the league has given no timetable for announcing its findings, they have reportedly found that 11 of 12 balls provided by the Patriots for the game did not meet league standards. Brady said he had yet to be contacted by league officials about the issue, which seems certain to cloud the build up to the Super Bowl in Phoenix, Arizona. The title game and its attendant halftime show draw millions of viewers, with television advertisers paying as much as $4 million a slot to reach the massive audience. Tom Brady of the New England Patriots throws a touchdown pass to Rob Gronkowski (not pictured) against the Indianapolis Colts . Brady talks to the media during a press conference to address the under inflation of footballs used in the AFC championship game at Gillette Stadium . Brady, who also regularly appears in celebrity news magazines due to his marriage to Brazilian supermodel Gisele Bundchen, admitted the controversy had soured his preparations for the Super Bowl. 'It's disappointing that a situation like this happens,' Brady said. 'Obviously I would love to be up here in a very joyful mood. These are the best two weeks of the year if you happen to be one of the two teams still playing.' The whiff of scandal could be especially damaging for the Patriots, who have been sanctioned for infractions in the past. Belichick was fined $500,000 and the team docked $250,000 over the 2007 'spygate' affair, in which the NFL found they illegally filmed another team's hand signals during a game. If the NFL does find the Patriots purposely under-inflated the balls, they could be subject to fines and the loss of draft picks. As for the Super Bowl, Brady said he believes whatever the outcome of the league's probe, his team belongs there. 'I feel like we won the game fair and square,' he said. The controversy comes at the end of an NFL season dogged by lurid headlines over domestic violence scandals, with Baltimore Ravens star Ray Rice kicked out of the sport after video emerged of him punching his future wife unconscious in an elevator. Minnesota Vikings running back Adrian Peterson also saw his season cut short when he was suspended for severely whipping his four-year-old son with a tree branch.","ITV's Tom Bradby is bemoaning the spelling ability of US Twitter users .

"If you want to go to Paris, flying by private jet is not the first option that would spring to mind. But the method may no longer be the preserve merely of the rich, the famous or business executives. For a firm is offering flights from London to Paris by private jet that can cost less than £160 per person. Flights on a four-seater Citation Mustang flight to Paris can be booked for between £564 and £627 – cheaper per person than a business class seat with British Airways (£336) or Eurostar (£276). Scroll down for video . Jenny Coad boarded the Citation Mustang flight to Paris from London's Biggin Hill this week . The only catch is that the trip is one-way, with no guarantee you can use the same method for the return journey. The price is relatively low because the aircraft would otherwise be flying empty to Paris. They take off from London Biggin Hill. At 12 miles out, the Kent airfield is closer to the centre of London than Heathrow or Gatwick. They land at Paris Le Bourget airport, just four miles from the city centre. By contrast, commercial flights land at Charles de Gaulle airport, 16 miles from Paris. For your money, you get continental breakfast, coffee and champagne – plus a view out of the front windows. The seats are leather and no one nags you about seatbelts, overhead lockers or electronic devices. The four-seater private plane can be booked as a whole with prices for four lower than on British Airways . The private jet normally flies empty between Biggin Hill in London and Paris Le Bourget airport . The service is the idea of Sergey Petrossov, founder of JetSmarter, an app launched last year for booking private jets via smartphones. According to Mr Petrossov, 30 per cent of private jets travel empty – they are on their way to pick a client up or are returning to base after dropping them off. Mustang jet... £497-£622 . Eurostar Business Class... £1,184 . British Airways Business Class... £1,364 . His app provides a ‘live access marketplace’ so potential travellers can see which of the 3,000 jets has seats available. Catching a private jet means travellers skip the hassle of check-in and security, and can arrive five minutes before their flight takes off. Passports are checked in advance and, as with the Paris flight, private jets tend to use smaller airports, which can be closer to your destination. Bernhard Fragner, the CEO of GlobeAir, which owns the Mustang, says customers off on a hunting trip can even take their own rifles. Until now, private jets have catered primarily for wealthy business travellers, footballers and celebrities. The typical flyer, according to Mr Fragner, has a net income of more than £1million a year. One GlobeAir client booked a jet to fly a cat to Dubai for Valentine’s Day, another had fresh tomatoes flown from Sicily to their yacht in Cannes. The most extravagant jet available to rent via the JetSmarter app is a Boeing 767 – the type a head of state might use. ‘Something like that would cost £11,500 per hour,’ Mr Petrossov said. ‘But you’d get a bedroom, dining room, living room, office and lashings of gold finishes for your money.’","Seats on  Citation Mustang from London to Paris are less than £160 .

"Andy Murray has accused his critics of double standards in the wake of Rafael Nadal's dramatic comeback win over American Tim Smyczek in the Australian Open second round. The 27 year-old Scot was back on the practice courts on Thursday ahead of his own third round against Joao Sousa, but before that he took to Twitter and took a pointed swipe at reaction to the Nadal win, which saw him come back from cramps to survive in five sets. 'When I cramped and won in the US Open last year I was a ""drama queen, unfit, needs to see a shrink, faker"" weird…' he posted. Andy Murray's coach Amelie Mauresmo takes evasive action as her charge practices on Thursday . Murray will resume his Australian Open campaign on Friday against Joao Sousa . Murray took to Twitter to vent about what he perceives to be double standards when it comes to fatigue . Murray worked up a sweat as he prepared for his third-round match on Friday . Murray hits with his partner while the MCG cricket ground can be seen in the background (left) Murray was clearly not having a go at Nadal, but taking umbrage at what may have been said via various platforms about his match last year at Flushing Meadows against Dutchman Robin Haase, in which he suffered cramping before coming through in four sets. As someone who has come through his share of matches when he has had to overcome physical difficulty he feels there are some double standards at play. There are myriad of ways these days for anyone to express a personal view via social media – and many thousands of words will have passed the lips of broadcasters about the Haase match. However, an initial search of mainstream reports filed by those who were in New York does not show up any obvious accusations that Murray was malingering in some way. American supercoach Nick Bollettieri is noted as having said: 'One minute Murray is dying, the next he is a gladiator.' But there does not appear any widespread suggestions of what the player thinks was said. Rafael Nadal needed treatment during his second-round match against Tim Smyczek . Nadal looked set to crash out of the tournament in the early stages before battling back to win in five sets . Nadal celebrates what at one stage looked an unlikely victory to progress into the third round . Sportsmail, for example, noted that he was 'cramping, limping and lolling around like a wounded beast' before closing the match out in four sets when barely able to serve properly. But there is also the conclusion that 'it is much to Murray's credit that he still won. Lesser competitors would have succumbed.' Among the circumstances that some reports point out is that he and Haase were called very abruptly to the court with little time for preparation, as the preceding women's match took only 47 minutes, and that he has a history of struggling on the Louis Armstrong Stadium, where the match took place. Murray has been especially sensitive about how on court physical issues are portrayed since a match against Finland's Jarkko Nieminen at the 2012 French Open, during which he suffered back spasms before coming through to win. Murray was troubled by cramp during his four-set epic against Robin Haase at the US Open last year . Virginia Wade called Murray a 'drama queen' after he required treatment during the French Open in 2012 . The commentating Virginia Wade used the term 'drama queen' to describe his demeanour, which inevitably got plenty of traction in the media. This probably explains his latest outpouring on Twitter, a fairly blunt instrument that affords precious little scope for wider explanation (see his declaration about Scottish independence, for example). It also points to him being very much keyed up for this high-pressure fortnight, the next leg for him being Friday's encounter with world number 55 Sousa from Portugal. It is probably a positive thing, as a sense of indignation has always been a powerful motivational tool for Murray.","Rafael Nadal struggled with his fitness against Tim Smyczek .

"An Australian basketballer has turned around a stunning performance on the court after a Twitter troll cruelly joked about bringing along his mother, who suffers from breast cancer,in a hearse. Hugh Greenwood, 22, from Hobart, Tasmania, performed his first slam-dunk in years playing for New Mexico against the University of Nevada (UNLV) on Thursday. The college basketballer said he was motivated to score a whopping 22 points - thought to be close to a career best - after seeing the troll make foul cancer jokes prior to the game. 'There's a line and it gets crossed,' he said courtside. 'I was motivated tonight.' 'I got my first dunk since my freshman year and I credit him for getting us a win tonight because that's what motivated me.' In an exclusive interview with Daily Mail Australia Hugh's mother Andree, who has incurable secondary breast cancer, said she was shocked when he revealed on TV what had him fired up.

This is one of the vile tweets Hugh Greenwood received, according to two family members . 'He's a good kid. He's really had a lot of adversity the past few years, on and off the court, and with my health,' she said. 'It did give me a bit of a shock when he put it on national TV.' Mrs Greenwood, whose recurrent cancer has spread to her lungs, was unaware of the vile tweets prior to the match. 'I thought something must of been up when he dunked it (two-handed, mind you!) in the first half,' she said. 'He looked angry and he doesn't often play ""angry""....he is a very ""poised and unemotional"" player usually.' Hugh was paraded on social media following the interview - and the naysayer's tweets have been deleted. Hugh's younger sister Josie, 20, posted a family text message on social media for the world to see. 'I love you guys so much. No one messes with my family,' the text said.

When Hugh Greenwood was asked what motivated him by a courtside reporter, she could hardly have expected his fiery response . Action: Hugh Greenwood spent four years at the Australian Institute of Sport before moving to America to pursue his basketball dream . Australia's official basketball association congratulated him on a 'great game'. 'Australia is right behind you and your family,' Basketball Australia tweeted. Hugh, in his senior year at university, has become a key player in the New Mexico Lobos side. Years ago, following his mother's initial diagnosis, he started a breast cancer fundraiser called Pink Pack to raise funds for the cancer research centre at his university several years ago, . A fan organisation for the opposing team, the UNLV Rebels, even penned him a letter wishing him and his mother the best after the incident. 'We want to extend our condolences and offer our support as you and your family deal with your mother's diagnosis. The letter said the fan organisation did not have the funds to make a 'respectable' contribution to Pink Pack, but passed on their best wishes. 'For years we have watched you from the Rebellion as you played with passion, poise and sportsmanship. Family: Proud mum Andree Greenwood is pictured with her son Hugh and daughter Josie . 'If your efforts consist of the same traits, we believe you will be successful in whatever goals you've set for your organisation's fundraising' His mother, an avid basketball coach herself, said it was unfair for college-level basketball players to cop online abuse when they are not even professional athletes. As for Hugh - who left home when he was 14 to live at the Australian Institute of Sport - he was certainly touched by the overwhelming response to his good form. 'I can't even begin 2 thank everyone directly 4 your kind words over social media. There have been endless amounts,' the guard tweeted. 'All I can say is Thankyou!'

"Well, we knew it was coming. First, there he was, quoting Nietzsche. Next, he was backstage at a Morrissey concert. Refusing chicken. And finally, David Dimbleby was saying his name out loud on last week’s programme as if he were reading it in Klingon from the autocue. Joey Barton helped QPR get back into the Premier League last weekend. But on Thursday night, the alice band was off as he came out to perform on telly’s toughest field of play - Question Time. This week it came from Heathrow’s new Terminal Two. Where an audience stacked up like passengers waiting for a ton of snow delayed flights were introduced to Joey, by David Dimbleby, as the 'philosopher king' of football. Invitation: Joey Barton appeared on BBC Question Time after being invited to join the panel . Making his point: Barton's first contribution was to say that the support for UKIP was a protest vote . And when . that notion wasn’t greeted with a chorus of boos and a hail of rotting . vegetable matter - Joey was clearly not the villain in the black hat . with the twirly moustache -  it meant they could immediately move on to . the first item on the agenda, namely UKIP and Nigel Farage. Of . which there was plenty to say, as you could imagine. But not for ages . from the Hoops midfield general, who in this Question Time formation, . was being played out wide on the left. We even heard from 'the man in . the spectacles and blonde hair' in the audience before Joey chipped in. However, when he did, he certainly made an impact. Joey . Barton is clearly not an idiot. He is also a man who is used to doing . his job under the unswerving gaze of the public. Which makes his . analogy, in the opening gambit on the show about UKIP’s European . success, all the more awkward, and annoying. Because he chose to look at . the the nature of the voting public’s deliberation about the current . social climate as a choice between 'four really ugly girls'. Now . I’m not so twee and naive as to pretend I don’t know where he was going . with that. I clearly do. I’m sure we all do. And of course, he does. But it doesn’t make it right. So why did he? Why did he think that . comparison, with an age to think about it as his other panelists . blathered on, would be the one that nailed the point? Well, . to be fair to him, he answered that particular question later on. Further into the debate, a lady in the audience picked up positively on . something else Joey had said, but also pulled him up on that statement. And with an apparent air of contrition physically familiar from his on . field exploits having just lumped a member of the opposition, he put his . hands up. Controversy: Barton's 'four ugly girls' analogy did not go down well with the audience and on social media . The top table: Barton was joined on the panel at Heathrow Terminal 2 by Piers Morgan (left) 'I . apologise', he told the audience, clearly aware of the fact that what . he’d said earlier was still hanging in the air like a pall. 'Maybe I was . a little bit nervous', he continued, before acknowledging what UKIP’s . Louise Bours had earlier suggested that 'his brains were in his feet'. And . to a great extent, that worked in not making the audience his enemy. He . went on to discuss very eloquently the ‘disillusioned voters’ who . hadn’t made their way to a booth. As well as making a case for a new . runway that didn’t, it turned out, end up adding to the traffic over his . and his neighbours' rooftops around Heathrow. 'Nimbie' was a word the Dimbleby used in response to Barton’s statement. And . Nimbie the extremely well-paid footballer with the dream house may be. But he still had a good stab at just being a man with a perfectly . reasonable grievance, and was not afraid to air it. Hitting back: UKIP MEP Louise Bours said Barton's point proved that 'footballers' brains are in their feet' Watching on: Morgan looks on as QPR midfielder Barton makes his point in the debate at Heathrow Airport . Dinner time: Piers Morgan posted this photo and wrote: 'All smiles over #BBCQT dinner. Have to say - Le Pitbull @Joey7Barton is great company. For an ugly bloke.' In . further being fair to him, he also managed to get all the panel nodding . in agreement when they discussed the apparent protracted release of . documents about the war in Iraq. 'I can’t see the point if we’re not . going to get the whole truth', said Joey, before adding that the . situation was not too dissimilar to the Hillsborough enquiry. But . in spite of all his worthy contributions to the show, it is clearly . going to be the 'ugly girls' statement that will provide an apparent . mirror into him and his chosen industry. There is no doubt he is an . excellent English footballer. But he has constantly been there on the . cusp for big clubs, and his country. And yet has always managed to find a . way to not take it on to the next phase. Joey . is clearly clever enough to have deduced why this might be. And it is . perhaps because he is always still potentially one 'ugly girls' moment . away from sticking his foot in his mouth again, be it on the pitch, or . with the press, which is a shame. Because there seems to be one of the . good guys in there somewhere, waiting to get out.","Barton made his Question Time debut as part of the panel on Thursday night .

"BBC pundit Mark Lawrenson has been heavily criticised after he speculated that convicted rapist Ched Evans was a 'victim' after his move to Oldham Athletic collapsed at the last minute. The former Liverpool and Ireland defender has been called 'vile' and 'a mug' after his comments on Football Focus on Saturday. He said: 'It's become a circus, almost, and I'm just saying from everything I've read this week sometimes you're actually thinking, is he (Evans) a victim? It's just been madness. Criticism: Mark Lawrenson has been attacked online after he speculated whether Ched Evans was a 'victim' Opinion: Mr Lawrenson appeared on Football Focus on Saturday and said: 'It's become a circus, and I'm just saying from everything I've readsometimes you're actually thinking, is he (Evans) a victim?' 'There's no argument that the FA need to come out with guidelines. They have been conspicuous by their absence. There should be something set down - you can't go anywhere near people like Ched Evans until everything has been resolved.' Evans was on the brink of returning to professional football with Oldham last week. But on the eve of the deal being signed the League One club pulled out blaming 'enormous pressure from sponsors and threats to staff and their families'. An unnamed director at the club was allegedly told his own daughter would be raped if the former Welsh international was allowed to play. More than 70,000 people signed a petition opposing the Oldham deal but there has been a trickle of support for the disgraced former Wales and Sheffield United striker. Premier League managers Harry Redknapp and Steve Bruce both said he should be allowed to return to football. And at Oldham's match with Doncaster Rovers on Saturday there were some chants of 'One Ched Evans' and 'Sign him up', and one banner read: '70,000 where are you?'. The BBC has responded to criticism of Mr Lawrenson. Backtrak:  Oldham Athletic was very close to signing Evans but pulled out at the last minute . A spokesman said: 'Mark was contributing to a wider discussion in which he was highlighting the media frenzy this week. In no way was he claiming Ched Evans was the victim, which is apparent in the full context of the conversation.' The footballer himself spoke out after the deal collapsed blamed ‘mob rule’ for scuppering the deal, and claimed his silence had been ‘misinterpreted as arrogance’. And he did finally apologise to ‘the woman concerned’ – but continued to maintain his innocence. Yesterday it emerged that Evans could face a further 14 months out of football if he continues his fight to clear his name. Former Sheffield United player Evans has been shunned by several football clubs since he left prison after two-and-a-half years following his conviction for the rape of a 19-year-old woman. Now it appears his best hope of returning to the game appears to be having his conviction overturned. This could take more than a year to get to the Court of Appeal and will mean Evans will not have played a professional game for four years. Because he is still on licence Evans is also barred from leaving Britain for extended periods, which has led him to put his wedding plans on hold.","Pundit branded 'vile' for speculating if convicted rapist might be a 'victim'

"With husband Roger, Lara Griffiths enjoyed a life of luxury following a lottery win that netted the couple a £1.8 million fortune. Today, after blowing the cash on luxury cars, a converted barn and hundreds of designer handbags, the couple are divorced and Lara has been reduced to selling her beloved bags in order to support her two daughters, Ruby, nine and Kitty, six. She revealed her plight during her first TV interview on ITV's breakfast show, Daybreak, where presenter Kate Garraway looked on sympathetically as Mrs Griffiths told of her bad luck. Scroll down for video . Haunted: According to Lara Griffiths, she will be dogged by the money spent on bags for the rest of her life . Blame game: Lara says that her estranged husband Roger is to blame for their loss - although he denies it . 'Do you know, this handbag thing will haunt me until the day I die?' she said. 'I always bought handbags from a child and they're something that I collect and I did buy handbags before winning the money and subsequent to winning the money.' 'You were probably tempted to buy slightly more expensive ones after you had £1 million in the bank though,' commented Garraway. 'Absolutely,' replied Griffith before adding: 'And I'm glad I did because for the last 18 months since Roger left us, the sale of those bags has supported my children.' Both Lara and her former husband, Roger, quit their jobs in the wake of their lottery win — Roger earned £38,000 as an IT manager and Lara a similar amount as a performing arts teacher — and embarked on the sort of spending spree of which most of us can only dream. For sale: The couple's £679,000 luxury barn conversion is being sold but is at risk of being repossessed . Happy: Roger and Lara on holiday in Miami six months before he left and revealed that the cash was gone . But according to Lara, the couple’s Lottery win wrecked her life after a series of disastrous decisions wiped out their fortune and wrecked their marriage, for which she places the blame squarely on Roger's shoulders. ‘He’d f****d up everything,’ she said in an interview with MailOnline. Her husband, meanwhile, denies the accusations, who today claims to have just £7 in the bank and lives alone in a small, chilly, stone cottage in Harrogate. ‘Both of us wanted to try to turn our win into more,’ he says. ‘I thought I was doing the right thing. I was the one who won that money, so I took responsibility.’ ‘It didn’t cross my mind that I’d end up here — the one thing I didn’t want to do was waste that money.' Griffith, who admitted that she still plays the lottery, was asked about her former five star lifestyle by entertainment editor, Richard Arnold but described claims that she once enjoyed luxury Dubai holidays, top notch London weekends and drove a Lexus as 'nonsense, absolute nonsense.' 'I don't know when that was,' she retorted. 'I wasn't there. We didn't live a rock n'roll lifestyle... at all. 'We ploughed our money into putting something into the community. You know, we really wanted to do something right.'

"Few women would pass up the chance of being whisked away in a helicopter by 007 star Daniel Craig – even the Queen could not resist such an invitation. A great-grandmother and octogenarian, she is probably too mature now to be called a Bond girl. But when the secret agent from the movies called on the Palace to ask her to accompany him on a  special mission, she had no hesitation in accepting. Scroll down for video . The Queen was happy to accept her mission as the latest 'Bond girl' especially for the Opening Ceremony . Gary Connery, right, the skydiving 'Queen' prepares for his dramatic arrival at the Olympics opening ceremony on Friday night pictured with James Bond double Mark Sutton, middle, in the helicopter en route to the stadium . Her Majesty's Secret Service: Bond and the Queen (aka Mark Sutton and Gary Connery) drop into the stadium . The result was the most talked-about . sequence of Danny Boyle’s stunning Olympics Opening Ceremony. In the . segment, prerecorded at Buckingham Palace, the Queen receives the 007 . star with the words: ‘Good evening, Mr Bond.’ They then leave and walk towards a . helicopter, corgis in tow, and at one point Craig gives a nuanced glance . in Her Majesty’s direction. It was the Queen’s first film role, but it was revealed yesterday that she needed only one take. ‘She’s a good actor,’ said Mr Boyle . last night. ‘She’s very sharp. You didn’t have to tell her anything . twice.’ Not only that, he added, but she also ‘got along with James Bond . very well’. It was all the irrepressible Mr Boyle’s idea. He raised it with London 2012 chief Sebastian Coe, who thought it inspired. If Lord Coe was a little doubtful, . however, that it would be well received by the Queen’s courtiers, he was . quickly reassured. They listened sagely, laughed, and promised to ask . the Boss. The Mail on Sunday has discovered that . it was her deputy private secretary, Edward Young, a former adviser to . William Hague, who acted as the go-between. The Queen arrives in the Royal Box at the Olympic Stadium alongside IOC President Jacques Rogge (left) Daredevil: Stuntman Gary Connery, who stood in for the Queen, prepares his special 'wingsuit' for a jump in May . The Queen greets 007 at Buckingham Palace with the words 'Good Evening, Mr Bond' in the film sequence leading up to her parachute 'jump' Some insiders refer to him as the . ‘Secret Agent’ – because he was  the key link between the Palace and Mr . Boyle’s team. Lord Coe had served as chief of staff to William Hague . around the time Mr Young was working as the then Opposition leader’s . communications chief. Palace insiders felt it was a . fortuitous connection that at least gave Lord Coe a chance of winning . approval for the plan. The idea appealed to Mr Young, 45, who went to . Reading Grammar School and worked in managerial roles at  Barclays . before becoming an adviser to Shadow Chancellor Francis Maude and then . Mr Hague. Mr Young, who is married, moved to Granada TV as . communications director in 2001 before taking up his role at Buckingham . Palace in 2007. Smooth operators: James Bond actor Daniel Craig and the Queen in the helicopter . Sources said Her Majesty’s only . stipulation for her acting role was that she would choose what to wear. Eschewing the bikini favoured by some who have gone before her – most . memorably Ursula Andress and Halle Berry – she decided on a salmon . dress. In the helicopter scene, she was . played by Julia McKenzie, famed for portraying Miss Marple. The scene . concluded with the stunt double  of the Queen parachuting into the . Olympic Stadium. Seconds later the real Queen, wearing the same dress as . she did in the filmed sequence, was met with roars of laughter and a . standing ovation as she entered the arena together with Prince Philip. The Palace scenes were filmed in the . quadrangle, the Grand Entrance, the East Gallery, the Audience Room and . the West Terrace – and even starred Her Majesty’s dogs, including . 13-year-old Monty, previously owned by the Queen Mother. The Queen was . said to have ‘immensely enjoyed’ her acting experience. Yesterday, reciprocating Mr Boyle’s favourable comments about her acting skills, the Queen declared his show ‘wonderful’. And one Hollywood veteran said: ‘It . was a brilliant and daring move – all film performances can slip from . being such a good idea at the time to then getting an appalling . reception from viewers. ‘The Queen played a blinder by acting and, like all great performers, also being herself.’ Dramatic entrance: The helicopter hovered over the Olympic Stadium, before the 'Queen' jumped out, pulling the rip cord on a Union Flag parachute . Having made history as the first skydiver . to safely land without using a parachute, daredevil Gary Connery is . used to high-profile stunts.Now, after acting as the Queen’s skydiving . stunt-double during the Opening Ceremony, the father of two says he has . realised his dream. ‘I had the best seat in the house for a show that . was seen around the world,’ he says. Gary and James Bond double Mark Sutton, 41, underwent months of secret training for their show-stealing jump. On the night, Gary, 43, was sewn into a copy of the salmon dress the . Queen was wearing, and the duo were driven to Stapleford airfield, . Essex. Their helicopter was given the all-clear to take off at 8.50pm by . military air-traffic controllers and then guided into position over the . arena at 800ft for the pair to make their entrance. After deploying their parachutes at 500ft, the duo steered away from the stadium and landed on a nearby bridge. Gary now says he has only one regret from the night: ‘I really wanted to . keep the dress, but  I wasn’t allowed. It would have looked great on a . night out.’ In May, Gary completed the world’s first skydive without a parachute. He . leapt 2,400ft using a winged jumpsuit to land on a pile of cardboard . boxes.

"Are Liverpool right to stand by Luis Suarez? Liverpool scored another massive PR own goal last night after allowing Luis Suarez to contest the FA’s claim that a three-game ban for biting is not harsh enough. Suarez accepted an FA charge of violent  conduct for his outrageous attack on Chelsea’s Branislav Ivanovic at Anfield on Sunday. But the Uruguayan and his employers have risked yet another backlash after making it clear to the governing body that they will appeal should an independent disciplinary commission hand down a more severe punishment than the standard three-match suspension. A three-man panel will convene on Wednesday morning to consider the evidence submitted by both the FA and Liverpool. Jaws of despair: Luis Suarez's latest controversy has landed him in further hot water with the FA . They could decide that three games is . sufficient punishment but a far more likely outcome is that Suarez will . face a ban which will keep him out of action for the start of next . season. An FA statement read: ‘Luis  Suarez . has today (Tuesday) accepted a charge of violent  conduct, following an . incident with Chelsea’s Branislav Ivanovic in Sunday’s fixture at . Anfield. ‘However, Suarez has denied the FA’s . claim that the standard punishment of three matches is clearly . insufficient for this offence. ‘The incident was not seen by the match officials and has therefore been retrospectively reviewed.’ Or disgusted? Perhaps the taste of Ivanovic's arm is still in the forward's mouth . The tribunal will take into consideration past behaviour and previous cases before reaching a . conclusion on Suarez, who was banned for seven games after he bit PSV . Eindhoven’s Otman Bakkal in November 2010. Tottenham’s Jermain Defoe escaped a . long ban and fine in October 2006 as he was booked after biting Javier . Mascherano, then of West Ham. Had Suarez been booked last Sunday, the FA . would have still had the power to take him to task as the rules have . changed since then. Having accepted the FA’s charge, . Suarez will start his ban this weekend. He will miss the trip to . Newcastle on Saturday, the Merseyside derby at Anfield on May 5 and . Liverpool’s visit to Fulham on May 12. Or concern? Perhaps Suarez is worrying about how much first-team football he's likely to miss . Speaking out: Prime Minister David Cameron said the FA need to take a hard line . Disbelief: The Chelsea defender didn't seem to know how to react after he was bitten by Suarez yesterday . But, by promising to defend their . player against a possible longer ban, Liverpool can expect more . condemnation as they have already been rebuked for failing to administer . their own suspension. The matter has been taken so seriously that the . Prime Minister entered the debate on Monday. Suarez was fined an undisclosed amount . — thought to be two weeks’ wages, a figure that equates to more than . £200,000 — on Monday morning. He insisted that the money be donated to . the Hillsborough Families Support Group. The 26-year-old was warned by managing . director Ian Ayre that he was on his last chance at Anfield. The . Uruguay striker was found guilty by the FA in December 2011 of using . racially abusive language to Patrice Evra. Liverpool have stressed that  Suarez, . who has been strongly linked with Bayern Munich, will not be sold this . summer and have vowed to work with him to improve his behaviour.

Look, ref: Ivanovic shows his arm to referee Kevin Friend following the biting incident at Anfield yesterday . Previous: Suarez bites Otman Bakkal of PSV while playing for Ajax . Repeat? The PSV star was as perplexed as Ivanovic by Suarez's behaviour . Liverpool forward Luis Suarez is back in the spotlight after appearing to bite Chelsea defender Branislav Ivanovic on the arm during the 2-2 draw with Chelsea at Anfield, going on to score a late equaliser. Here are some of the previous controversies surrounding the Uruguayan forward. February 2007: Suarez made his international debut for Uruguay against Colombia but was sent off in the final minutes after being shown a second yellow card for dissent. November 2007: Joined Ajax from Uruguayan side Nacional but he was later suspended by the Dutch giants after a half-time dressing-room altercation with team-mate Albert Luque. July 2010: During the 2010 World Cup quarter-finals, Suarez prevented Ghana's Dominic Adiyiah from scoring in the final minute with a deliberate handball on the line and was subsequently sent off. A penalty was awarded but missed by Asamoah Gyan and footage showed Suarez celebrating on the sidelines. Uruguay eventually went through to the last four on penalties. November 2010: Suarez was handed a seven-match ban by the Dutch FA and fined by his club for biting PSV Eindhoven midfielder Otman Bakkal during an Eredivisie match. October 2011: Following his move to Liverpool in January 2011, he was involved in a tackle with Everton's Jack Rodwell and goes down with apparent minimal contact. Rodwell was then sent off. October 2011: Suarez was alleged to have racially abused Manchester United's Patrice Evra during a Premier League match. Suarez was later found guilty by an independent regulatory commission and banned for eight matches and fined £40,000. December 2011: Was seen making an offensive gesture towards Fulham fans. At this time he had already been charged by the Football Association over the racism incident, although not yet punished, but was handed a further one-match ban for the gesture. February 2012: United and Liverpool met again at Old Trafford, but more controversy blew up as Suarez refused to shake Evra's hand before kick-off. October 2012: Celebrated a goal against Everton by diving in front of Toffees boss David Moyes who had earlier claimed that 'divers' such as Suarez were putting fans off the English game. January 2013: Handles the ball prior to scoring Liverpool's winner in the FA Cup third round tie at Mansfield. April 2013: Appears to bite Branislav Ivanovic on the arm but escapes punishment on the pitch as the referee fails to see it, and scores Liverpool's equaliser seven minutes into stoppage time as they draw 2-2 with Chelsea at Anfield.","Luis Suarez accepts charge of violent conduct by FA for bite on Ivanovic .

"An amphibious tourist bus sank into the freezing River Mersey freezing during a city tour. Passengers had to be evacuated from the Yellow Duckmarine as it began sinking in the Albert Dock, in Liverpool. Yellow Duckmarine bosses have now launched an investigation into the 'unfortunate incident'. Yellow Duckmarine bosses say they do not yet know why the vehicle sank during a tour at Albert Dock, pictured . The colourful fleet are a well-known tourist attraction in Liverpool and tour the city from land and water. Passengers were moved on to a pontoon when the vehicle began to sink at about 12.45pm on Saturday in accordance with safety procedures, a tour spokesman said. The company has launched an internal inquiry into the cause and say they are keeping their remaining vehicles out of the water. Three of the four-strong fleet were today back on the streets of Liverpool but did not enter the dock waters. Tourists were being offered . reduced rates for the shortened version of the usual 55-minute - which . takes in the historic Liver Buildings, St George's Hall and Chinatown. Tourists were evacuated from the colourful bus boat before attempts were made to tow it . The amphibious vehicle sank while it was being towed to a slipway in Salthouse Dock . Eyewitness Roger O'Doherty, who had been attending the NUT conference on Saturday, said: 'They got a tow boat to try and pull it onto the slipway but they were going quite quickly and it unhinged. 'The water was up to the level of the windows.' Sales manager Paul Furlong praised the crew on board the boat for their professionalism. He said: 'We have been running short road-only tours until the investigation is completed. 'It's . still a fine tour but we're not charging the full amount. The incident . was unfortunate and happened towards the end of the tour.' Mr Furlong said there was no-one on board when the Duckmarine sank. Dozens of people watched from the side of the dock as the Yellow Duckmarine tipped and began sinking . The rest of the fleet is being kept out of the water while an investigation is carried out into why the vehicle sank . He said: 'The vehicle only sank when it was being towed away and at that point the passengers were well away from the vessel. 'We are looking into what happened. Our crew are incredibly experienced and they acted very quickly. The crew followed the correct procedure.' Ducks - which were originally called DUKWs when created in the US to transport men and materials during World War II - are no longer in production and each one still in use is accounted for. Known as Wacker Quackers, they have become one of Liverpool's quirkiest visitor attractions.

"ITV are preparing to go head-to-head with the BBC for the rights to Match of the Day as they consider a bid for the rights to Premier League highlights. The broadcaster, which last held the rights for Premier League highlights between 2001-04,  is considering a bid to get them back with the BBC's current £60million per year deal set to expire at the end of next season. The potential move adds a layer of intrigue to the Premier League rights bidding that is set to take place next year, with BT Sport looking to further threaten Sky Sports stranglehold on the live broadcasting of matches. ITV presenter Adrian Chiles could anchor Premier League highlight footage as the broadcaster considers a bid . ITV's commentary pair Clive Tyldsley (left) and Andy Townsend could soon be doing Premier League coverage . ITV's team of Ally McCoist (left), Des Lynam (centre) and Terry Venables last time they held the Premier League's highlights package in 2004, with the show 'The Premiership' Any potential ITV bid comes off the back of a difficult time for the broadcaster, who lost their live Champions League coverage after BT Sport spent £897million for exclusive rights from next season, and their live FA Cup rights to the BBC this year. Last time ITV held Premier League highlights rights, they signed Des Lynam from the BBC to host and attempted to switch the show from its regular late night slot on a  to Saturday prime time - but with little success. ITV have declined to comment on whether they are set to launch such a bid, but it is likely that any highlights show would be hosted by Adrian Chiles and feature regular pundits such as Lee Dixon and Andy Townsend. Chiles used to host Match of the Day 2 on the BBC until his switch to ITV ahead of the 2010 World Cup. Gary Lineker is the current host of Match of the Day on Saturday night on the BBC . The highlights show is currently celebrating its 50th anniversary on the BBC this season . In an interview with the Guardian earlier this month, the BBC's head of TV sport Philip Bernie spoke in praise of Match of the Day, which is celebrating its 50th anniversary this year. 'It has bucked the trend. But it is a unique proposition,' explained Bernie. 'People can get the clips they want to, they can watch Football First if they want to, they can watch the 12.45pm match on a Saturday and yet they still come to Match of the Day because it’s a great digest and it’s different to all those other things.'","ITV prepare to go head-to-head with BBC for Premier League highlights .

"After a mentally ill Bradley Ballard made a lewd gesture to a female guard at the Rikers Island jail, he was locked in his cell alone for seven increasingly agitated days in which he was denied some of his medication, clogged his toilet so that it overflowed, stripped off his clothes and tied a rubber band tightly around his genitals. During that period, guards passed Ballard's cell in the mental observation unit dozens of times, peering through the window in the steel door but never venturing inside — until it was too late. The 39-year-old Ballard was eventually found naked and unresponsive on the floor, covered in feces, his genitals swollen and badly infected. He was rushed to a hospital but died hours later. Died alone: In September of 2013, Ballard, 39, who was mentally ill and an inmate at the Rikers Island jail in New York, died a gruesome death there after being locked alone in his cell for seven days . 'He didn't have to leave this world like that. They could have put him in a mental hospital, got him some treatment,' Ballard's mother, Beverly Ann Griffin, said from her Houston, Texas, home. 'He was a caring young man.' Ballard's death last September, detailed in documents obtained by The Associated Press and in interviews with two city officials on condition of anonymity, came five months before another Rikers inmate in a similar mental health unit died in a cell that climbed to a suffocating 101 degrees because of malfunctioning heating equipment. Experts say Ballard's death is only the latest example of how poorly equipped the city's jail system is to handle the mentally ill, who make up about 40 per cent of the 12,000 inmates in the nation's most populous city. A third of those inmates suffer from serious mental illnesses such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. In Ballard's case, his family said he had been diagnosed as schizophrenic more than a decade ago, and he also had diabetes. Faced with rising criticism over conditions at Rikers, Mayor Bill de Blasio has vowed reforms. Correction Department spokesman Robin Campbell said in a statement Wednesday that Ballard's case is under investigation. He said mental health and jail officials have started shift-by-shift briefings on inmates like Ballard and are working on other measures 'so that a similar tragedy will not happen again.' More tests are needed to determine exactly how Ballard died, the medical examiner's office says. But preliminary findings show that he probably succumbed to sepsis, an infection that has spread through the body, according to the two officials. Ballard grew up in Houston and moved to New York to pursue a better life after working as a cook in a fried chicken restaurant, his family said. He spent six years behind bars after being arrested in 2004 for assaulting a receptionist and another employee of a New York law firm. Last June, he was arrested in Houston on public lewdness and assault charges for punching and exposing himself to a bus driver. He was sent back to jail in New York for not telling his parole officer that he had left the city. He was first placed in a Rikers facility for 17 days, then a Correction Department psychiatric hospital for 38 days. Then he was sent to a roughly 30-bed mental observation unit at Rikers. In documents obtained by the AP via a public records request, Cathy Potler, executive director of the city Board of Correction, gave her account of Ballard's case, based on a review of records, security footage and interviews with inmates. Grisly death: This 1990 photo provided by Curtis Griffin of his step-son Bradley Ballard shows Ballard in Houston when he was 16. Ballard was found naked, covered in feces with a rubber band tied around his badly infected genitals at Rikers Island . She noted that even though Ballard was in a unit where inmates are ordinarily allowed in and out of their cells to mingle with others for 14 hours a day, he was locked up continuously for seven days and for most of that time wasn't given his medication. The type of medication was not disclosed. Guards confined Ballard to his cell on September 4 after he stared for hours at a female officer, rolled up his shirt to look like a penis and thrust it toward her, Potler said. The next day, Potler wrote, Ballard intentionally flooded his combination sink-toilet, after which a mental health provider spoke with him for 15 seconds through the cell door. The next day, a plumber turned off the water to his cell. Over the next few days, guards and deputy wardens looked in his cell dozens of times throughout the day, Potler wrote, and the inmate was at times seen at the door.On September 10, video of an inmate delivering a tray of food to Ballard's cell showed the inmate covering his nose with his shirt and three officers backing away, 'presumably because of the foul odor coming from the cell,' Potler wrote. Ballard was checked on at least two dozen times that day and night, with an officer at one point seen kicking his cell door several times, according to Potler's account. By the time medical staffers were called in and his cell was opened, Ballard was so weak he couldn't move. He was pronounced dead early on the morning of September 11. Under city rules, mental health staffers are required to make twice-daily rounds in the unit where Ballard was jailed, and the guards on duty are supposed to be steadily assigned there and receive annual mental health training. But mental health staffers visited Ballard's cell only once before he was discovered to be in distress, according to Potler. And of the 53 officers who worked in the unit in the days leading up to Ballard's death, only one was steady, and none had received the required annual refresher course on mental health, Potler wrote. Terrible conditions: Ballard died last year at Rikers Iland after another Rikers inmate in a similar mental health unit died in a cell that climbed to a suffocating 101 degrees because of malfunctioning heating equipment . Following Ballard's death, Department of Health officials said a state investigation found workers missed multiple opportunities to treat him, transferred the unit chief to another facility and retrained staffers on how to do rounds and other procedures. Jail officers have long complained that they aren't sufficiently trained to handle severely mentally ill inmates. At a recent public meeting, a union official said trainees get 21.5 hours of mental health training during their 16 weeks of academy instruction, plus the three-hour annual refresher. In a statement, Norman Seabrook, president of the Correction Officers Benevolent Association, said Ballard's death was an example of 'non-communication between medical staff and uniform staff.' He said officers can notify members of the medical staff, 'but it's clearly up to them and solely them to determine treatment.' Ballard's death, though tragic, was unsurprising to those familiar with how the mentally ill fare in jails, said Dr. Bandy Lee, a Yale psychiatrist who was a co-author of a report critical of jail officials' use of solitary confinement. 'Correctional institutions are such a poor substitute for mental hospitals, which is what they're basically functioning as in our society,' she said. 'The problem is the correction setting is not fit to deliver the proper care, and in fact many of the settings exacerbate their symptoms.' Curtis Griffin, Ballard's stepfather, said a jail chaplain informed the family months ago of his son's death, but he wasn't told the specifics. 'They know,' Griffin said, 'that they were wrong in the way they handled the situation.'","Bradley Ballard, 39, a schizophrenic inmate at Rikers Island, died after being left alone in his cell for seven days .

"It is one of the major questions in the battle of the sexes: who is the better driver? And it seems the answer is men, at least at the learner stage. The Driving Standards Agency has revealed women made 857,000 major errors in their driving tests last year compared with men, who made 646,000 mistakes. The report found women were most likely to fail for poor reverse parking, steering mistakes and botched gear changes. The Driving Standards Agency revealed women made 857,000 major errors in their driving tests compared to 646,000 made by men . But men were more likely to lose track of their speed and fail for driving too fast. Both of the sexes had problems with spotting hazards at road junctions and forgetting to check their rearview mirrors. But despite the bad news, it appears women are actually better drivers once they have got a bit of experience. Female drivers are up to 20 per cent safer than men once they have passed their test, according to a recent study. Researchers analysed results from more than 154million miles of travel. Half the drivers were men and half were women. Experts found women were 28 per cent less likely to drive at night and 12 per cent less likely to break the speed limit than their male counterparts. Insurance figures show one third of all car accidents happen within a mile of the driver's home . A third of all car accidents happen . within a mile of the driver’s home – and skipping breakfast could be the . cause, according to  a report. Insurance figures show that accidents peak between 8am and 9am, as millions of Britons climb into their cars and set off on the daily commute or school run. But the research found drivers who make time for breakfast are not as likely to get involved in an accident. They performed 30 per cent better in a driving simulation compared to people who missed out on their first meal of the day. Rory Carlin from Halfords Autocentre, which commissioned the research, said: ‘Taking that extra few minutes to prepare for your journey in the morning can make all the difference and help make the roads safer for everyone. ‘Whether going to work or travelling further afield, preparing yourself with a hearty breakfast could be just as important as making sure your car is prepared.’","Driving Standards Agency released new figures .

"Jose Mourinho launched a scathing attack on Premier League referees after Chelsea's draw with Southampton in order to pile pressure on officials, according to Gary Neville. Mourinho said referee Anthony Taylor should be 'ashamed' of his performance after his side were not awarded a penalty when Cesc Fabregas appeared to be fouled by Southampton starlet Matt Targett. The Portuguese tactician labelled the incident a 'scandal' before adding 'there is a campaign against Chelsea' and Neville believes Mourinho's statement was a clever ploy. Jose Mourinho was fuming as he spoke to Sky Sports after his side's match against Southampton . The Chelsea manager says there is a 'campaign' against his side after Cesc Fabregas was denied a penalty . Neville, speaking on Sky Sports, said: 'He has planted a seed for the rest of the season. He'll probably take a fine for that. 'What Mourinho has done today has said he's drawing a line in the sand and said, ""I'm not accepting this any more"", letting the referees know this is unacceptable for the rest of the season. 'The campaign bit is him saying he's not having this any more.' Neville's comments came after Mourinho said this following the draw with Southampton: ‘The reality is that there are penalties and there are penalties - this was one was big, like Big Ben. ‘Referees are not here to guess, they are there to see. He assumed dishonest with Cesc and he is wrong. ‘Match after match coaches are saying Chelsea players are diving. Out of nothing Sam Allardyce starts talking about my players. Sky Sports pundit Gary Neville believes Mourinho's outburst was a clever ploy by the Chelsea boss . Mourinho was clearly unhappy with the decision after seeing one of his players booked for simulation . Fabregas smiles and holds his hands up in disbelief as referee Taylor holds aloft the yellow card . ‘I will go to the referee, wish him a good year and tell him he will be ashamed. There is a campaign against Chelsea. ‘In other countries where I worked before, tomorrow in the sports papers it would be front-page scandal because it is a scandal. ‘In this country - and I am happy with that, more than happy with that - we will just say that it was a big mistake with a big influence in the result. ‘I am happy that it is this way, with respect for the referee. He made a big mistake like I make, like the players make sometimes.’ Mourinho was furious with Taylor's decision to caution Fabregas when Targett appeared to clip the Spaniard while attempting to  control the ball inside the penalty area. Fabregas cannot contain his emotion as he is shown a yellow card after apparently diving in the box . Matt Targett's leg appears to trip the Chelsea midfielder but referee Anthony Taylor chose to book Fabregas . The former Barcelona midfielder became the fifth Chelsea player to be booked for diving this season, following Diego Costa, Gary Cahill, Branislav Ivanovic and Willian. Mourinho added: ‘They are not incidents, they are not incidents - that’s a campaign, that's a campaign. That's a clear campaign. ‘People, pundits, commentators, coaches from other teams - they react with Chelsea in a way they don't react to other teams. ‘You know the most crucial things over the last two weeks are not the cards? It is Filipe Luis and Eden Hazard because they could be in hospital with broken legs.' Chelsea striker Diego Costa was cautioned against Burnley following an incident with Tom Heaton .

"The 47-year-old woman shot in the head execution-style on a beach in Libya beside a former Royal Air Force officer was romantically linked with him, reports claimed last night.

Howie was formerly known as Lynn Gray, said New Zealand media, and she . was believed to have been recently divorced from an army officer. Reporters . from the Star-Times who went to her former home in Silverstream, north . of Wellington, seeking more information from her were turned away. Ms . Howie worked in New Zealand’s health sector, a profession that . including roles with the Ministry of Health and Regional Public Health. Her medical work also included working as a volunteer medic with St John Ambulance and Wellington Free Ambulance. According to her Linkedin profile, Ms Howie had lived for a number of years in Britain. She . had studied at the University of Birmingham, where she had obtained a . Master of Science degree in environmental health in 2006. Previously, . she had obtained a BSc in environmental biology at Nene College . Northampton, where she studied between 1986 and 1989. Photographs . posted on Facebook show Mr De Salis and Ms Howie face down on the sand . with a picnic blanket, food and drink next to them. Detectives are . believed to have found tyre tracks near the scene. Police . sources said it was possible the presence of an unmarried couple in the . area had outraged extremist Muslims who might have followed them to the . beach. Execution-style killings are not unknown in such circumstances. Mr De Salis was previously a flight lieutenant in the RAF but had been . working as a manager at an engineering company servicing the oil . industry at the time of his death. Mr . De Salis and Ms Howie were shot in the back of their heads while . picnicking at a remote spot on the coast about 50 miles west of the . capital Tripoli. Mr De Salis's family issued a statement saying they were 'shocked and devastated' by his death . The couple . were reported missing by friends in nearby Sabratha city where Mr De . Salis worked. Their bodies were found by police on Thursday. The . authorities have not ruled out robbery as the motive for the attack, . despite a rucksack and other belongings being left untouched. Both . bodies have been taken to Tripoli for post-mortem examinations to be . carried out. The Foreign . Office has called for a full investigation and Sabratha officials have . sent their condolences to the families and the governments of Britain . and New Zealand, adding: ‘This act is contrary to our morals and the . values of our religion.’ Mr . De Salis, originally from Sheffield, had worked in Libya for six years. Most recently he was employed as the manager of the power division of . First Engineering, transporting generators to Libya to provide . electricity. Karen De Salis, 48, is based in Cornwall, where she works as a personal assistant . at the restaurant of TV chef Nathan Outlaw – a protege of Rick Stein’s . who has appeared on the BBC shows Saturday Kitchen and Great British .

Mr De Salis’s family issued a statement saying they were ‘shocked and devastated’ by his death. They . described how he liked Libyan people and was ‘a decent and incredibly . loyal man who was loved by many’. They sent their sympathy to Ms Howie’s . family. Last night Mrs De Salis confirmed Mark De Salis was an ex-RAF officer, but said that her family did not want to add anything more. A . fellow expat worker and friend in Tripoli told The Mail on Sunday: . ‘Mark was a good guy.

"Everton may be struggling domestically this season, but that hasn't stopped Roberto Martinez's side gaining an unlikely fan in global pop star Justin Bieber. The 20-year-old took to Twitter on Saturday evening to upload pictures of himself playing football in the Toffees' white and purple third kit. Captioned with 'Great times', the Canadian uploaded three images in the strip after having taken part in a tournament held on an island in Turks and Caicos on Friday afternoon. VIDEO Scroll down to see a sporty Bieber fall off his skateboard in New York City . Pop star Justin Bieber uploaded Twitter pictures of himself playing football in an Everton kit . The Parrot Cay resort island is believed to be owned by Everton director Robert Earl - who co-founded restaurant chain Planet Hollywood. Bieber's public followers are known as 'Beliebers' and belief is something the Toffees are in desperate need of following a wretched run of form. The Bluenoses have plummeted to 13th in the Premier League table with 21 points after losing five of their last six games. Speaking after their 2-0 defeat at Hull City on New Year's Day, Martinez acknowledged something is missing from his side who finished fifth last season. Everton's 2-0 defeat at Hull on Saturday was their fifth Premier League defeat in their last six games . 'It is a tough period but the reality is that the second half of the season is an opportunity to get back our swagger and our enjoyment and get a positive result really quickly,' he said. 'Now is the time to find solutions internally and I need to bring the enjoyment back to my players on the pitch. That's the only concern that I have and I will do that with all my energy. 'We need to get back to finding that training is a real opportunity to show you can play for the team and show a real togetherness as a football club. 'Unfortunately when you are in this moment of difficulty, any change could affect us and punish us. That's the reality.' Everton boss Roberto Martinez admitted something is missing from his side after a strong season last . Martinez, whose stock was higher than ever last term, is now facing questions about his future at Goodison Park but with things not yet at crisis point he is firmly focused on the task at hand. 'If I had time to think about all those aspects, I wouldn't do my job,' he added. 'I welcome that pressure, I know the team that I have has quality. We are far away from the levels of quality we have in our play. 'It's for us to start a new year, a fresh year and quickly turn things around. It's the time to start finding solutions.' The 41-year-old will be hoping that begins on Tuesday night when Everton host West Ham in the FA Cup third round.

"Whistleblowing NYPD officer Frank Serpico, who exposed extensive police corruption among his peers, has spoken about the February 1971 day in which he suffered a gunshot wound to the face - and how his fellow officers failed to help him. In an essay for POLITICO Magazine, Serpico describes how he and two Narcotics officers were investigating an alleged drug dealer in Brooklyn - before he goes into what he sees as the continued need for the police to be externally reviewed and held responsible for their actions. On the day of the shooting, Serpico says his body became stuck when the man they were investigating tried to shut a front door. Dangerous: Frank Serpico, seen in this December 2011 file photo, says two officers failed to offer aid when he was facing off with an alleged drug dealer in 1971 . Hollywood adaptation: Serpico's life story was later turned into the 1973 movie 'Serpico,' starring Al Pacino. A still from the film is seen here . 'I couldn’t move, but I aimed my snub-nose Smith & Wesson revolver at the perp [...] From behind me no help came,' he writes. 'At that moment my anger got the better of me. I made the almost fatal mistake of taking my eye off the perp and screaming to the officer on my left: ""What the hell you waiting for? Give me a hand!"" I turned back to face a gun blast in my face. I had cocked my weapon and fired back at him almost in the same instant, probably as reflex action, striking him.' He later says that 'when I opened my eyes I saw an old Hispanic man looking down at me like Carlos Castaneda’s Don Juan. My ""backup"" was nowhere in sight. They hadn’t even called for assistance—I never heard the famed ""Code 1013,"" meaning ""Officer Down."" They didn’t call an ambulance either, I later learned; the old man did. One patrol car responded to investigate, and realizing I was a narcotics officer rushed me to a nearby hospital [...].' Serpico writes that 'The next time I saw my ""back-up"" officers was when one of them came to the hospital to bring me my watch. I said, “What the h*** am I going to do with a watch? What I needed was a back-up. Where were you?” He said, “F*** you,"" and left. Both my ""back-ups"" were later awarded medals for saving my life.' Poor treatment: Serpico, seen next to an image of Al Pacino playing the NYPD cop, says people continue to send him hate mail . Serpico says in the essay penned for POLITICO Magazine 'Even now, I do not know for certain why I was left trapped in that door by my fellow police officers. But the Narcotics division was rotten to the core, with many guys taking money from the very drug dealers they were supposed to bust. I had refused to take bribes and had testified against my fellow officers.' He continues 'Police make up a peculiar subculture in society. More often than not they have their own moral code of behavior, an ""us against them"" attitude, enforced by a Blue Wall of Silence. It’s their version of the Mafia’s omerta. Speak out, and you’re no longer ""one of us."" You’re one of ""them.""' Serpico claims to 'still get hate mail from active and retired police officers' in the years following his testimony before the Knapp Comission on police corruption. His life story was later made into a movie, called 'Serpico,' with Al Pacino playing him. Serpico writes that 'an even more serious problem — police violence — has probably grown worse, and it’s out of control for the same reason that graft once was: a lack of accountability.' Corruption: Serpico says of his time with the NYPD that 'the Narcotics division was rotten to the core, with many guys taking money from the very drug dealers they were supposed to bust' The former NYPD cop says 'Today the combination of an excess of deadly force and near-total lack of accountability is more dangerous than ever: Most cops today can pull out their weapons and fire without fear that anything will happen to them, even if they shoot someone wrongfully. All a police officer has to say is that he believes his life was in danger, and he’s typically absolved. What do you think that does to their psychology as they patrol the streets—this sense of invulnerability? The famous old saying still applies: Power corrupts, and absolute power corrupts absolutely.' He also dismisses the idea that police officers should use certain types of equipment while on the job. 'The automatic weapons and bulletproof vest may protect the officer, but they also insulate him from the very society he’s sworn to protect,' he asserts. 'All that firepower and armor puts an even greater wall between the police and society, and solidifies that ""us-versus-them"" feeling.' Serpico says in the years following his testimony before the Knapp Commission 'politicians who wanted to make a difference didn't' - and uses President Bill Clinton and Mayor Michael Bloomberg as examples. 'As for Barack Obama and his attorney general, Eric Holder, they’re giving speeches now, after Ferguson,' he writes. 'But it’s 20 years too late.' At the end of his essay for POLITICO Magazine, Serpico offers a six-point solution, which he says includes police using better methods to find new police officers, offering 'examples-based training and simulations,' making sure cops understand their communities and are active in them, holding police accountable when they do something illegal, rewarding and recognizing honest police officers, and also making sure police are monitored externally.","Former NYPD officer Frank Serpico has spoken about the February 1971 day in which he suffered a gunshot wound to the face .

"Crystal Palace boss Alan Pardew believes on-loan winger Wilfried Zaha is 'lucky' that the club are giving him the chance to shine in the Barclays Premier League. The England international is currently halfway through a season-long loan at Selhurst Park having struggled to break through at parent club Manchester United. The 22-year-old made a name for himself as a teenager at Palace and has started to show his form since Pardew was installed as boss of the south London club. Wilfried Zaha (left) is finally enjoying more game time after returning to Crystal Palace . Alan Pardew (centre) is willing to provide a platform for Zaha to reach his obvious potential . Pardew has led the Eagles to back-to-back Premier League victories since his return . And the Eagles' boss feels his club can provide a platform for Zaha to continue his development - whereas other promising talent is being wasted on the benches of top Premier League sides. 'I'm not sure about that option,' Pardew said when asked if he could make Zaha's move permanent this month. 'What I do know is that he's a player that needs to get his career on the move again. He's had a decent couple of games, made an impact and he needs to build on that. I think that is where he's at. He's a talent that needs to nail down a permanent position here, whether he's on loan or permanent but I've been very pleased with what I have seen.' Zaha's only goal since rejoining Palace came as a last-gasp equaliser in a 3-3 draw against a Newcastle side managed at the time by Pardew. Zaha's only goal since returning to Selhurst Park was against Pardew's Newcastle in a 3-3 draw . The 22-year-old winger found his options limited on the bench at Manchester United . And the former Magpies boss has challenged Zaha to show that sort of form once again and add to his two England caps. 'He has certainly got the ability,' Pardew added. 'I have worked with players who have fantastic technical ability for the Premier League but have only ever played in League One. 'All the attributes, you need to have the power, strength, the mental and technical quality to become a Premier League player. 'Wilfried has got a lot going for him and he has the potential to have an impact on the international stage at some point. I think the opportunities at Manchester United have been limited and that has been a problem. 'That has been a problem particularly at the top four or five clubs - Wilf is one of the lucky ones in that he has a platform on which he can play.' Crystal Palace have also taken a chance on young talent by bringing in Arsenal's Yaya Sanogo on loan . Pardew would not confirm reports of a January deal for Blackburn's Rudy Gestede . Pardew, who returns to former club Southampton for an FA Cup fourth-round clash on Saturday, has given a similar platform to Arsenal striker Yaya Sanogo after bringing the French forward in until the end of the season. He has also been linked with a move for Blackburn's Rudy Gestede but refused to comment on any potential deal - although he did admit enquiries for fresh faces have been made. 'Not that I'm aware of,' he said when asked about an approach for Gestede. 'I think we've enquired on about three, four or five different players and whether they're available - that's really where we're at. 'The chairman is pursuing some lines of enquiry in the right manner, in the way it should be conducted. Unfortunately not in front of the press! 'I'm not going to talk about other players at other clubs. I don't think that's fair.'","Wilfried Zaha has returned to his former club Crystal Palace on loan .

"It may be just a stone's throw away from the mass urban sprawl that is New York, but nobody lives there and just an abandoned prison and empty lunatic asylum remain as evidence that the island was ever inhabited. New York's mysterious Hart Island is, however, home to up to a million graves - many of them poor and unidentified, others interred there because of unfortunate circumstances. The city's authorities have been using the island, which is technically part of the Bronx district, as a city graveyard, burying bodies in plain pine boxes piled on top of one another and marked only with a number, since 1868. Long time practice: This archive picture shows prisoners from the now derelict Hart Island Prison burying bodies on the island. It is estimated that as many as one million people could be buried in mass graves there . Mass grave: A picture taken in 1990 shows a large trench dug ready for hundreds of bodies to be buried. Pine boxes used as coffins can be ssen at one end of the trench . The Department of Correction, which is in charge of the mass cemetary, estimates that there are between 750,000 and a million people buried on the island, which is visible on Google Maps but not included on the Subway line. The last public ferry to the island completed its final journey in 1976. According to Narratively, burials began at the island's northernmost tip, which became known as Potter's Field, when the city bought the island for $75,000. But that cemetary reportedly filled up over the last few years and burials moved to the south side of the island. City limits: Just within the boundaries of the Bronx is Hart Island where over 850,000 people are buried in New York City . In 2010, some 695 adults and 504 babies were buried there by prisoners from Riker's Island.Adult bodies are stacked three high with each grave containing up to 165 bodies and hidden from the world by 36 inches of dirt. A separate grave for stillborn babies and foetuses contains as many as 1,000 miniature boxes. Among those buried there is the first child to die of Aids in New York - one of the few to be afforded an individual grave marked SC B1 1985 (standing for Special Child, Baby 1, and the year of death) - as well as famous writers and actors including Bobby Driscoll who played Peter Pan in the 1953 DIsney movie. Off limits: The mysterious island still appears on Google Maps, but access to it is restricted and members of the public need special permission to go there . Driscoll died in 1968 and his body was found in a deserted tenement by two children playing. His body could not be identified and when it went unclaimed he was buried on Hart Island. The following year his mother contacted Disney in the hope of reuniting Driscoll with his desparately ill father before he died. But an NYPD fingerprint search located his body on Hart Island. His name appears on his father's gravestone at a California cemetery, but his remains are still on Hart Island. But, according Narratively, while many of those buried there are destitute or unidentified, others shouldn't be there at all. Narratively cites the case of obstetrician and gynecologist Laurie Grant who gave birth to a stillborn baby in 1993. Ms Grant almost died in the difficult delivery of the baby and was barely conscious when permission was granted to bury her child on Hart Island, although she could have afforded a funeral and her family already owned a burial plot. Although between 60 and 80 people are disinterred a year to be buried elsewhere when family members claim the remains of their loved ones, others like Ms Grant are reluctant. Many graves were destroyed when the Department of Defense operated a battery of Nike Ajax missiles there in the late 1950s and early 1960s in a bid to defend the city from potential nuclear attack from the Soviets. Many bodies were also buried below the water table, meaning that the bodies and their coffins were all but destroyed and the plots were reused. Although records of all bodies buried there have been written in logbooks, some were destroyed in a fire on the island in the 1970s - records of around 25,000 people were lost - and some are illegible. Famous: It is not just poor people buried there. American actor Bobby Driscoll, pictured with his mother and father, Cletus and Isabelle in 1949, was buried there after his death in 1968 . An error from 1989 and discovered years later found that two mass graves were given the same number. One of the graves was later renumbered, but given the same marking as another grave from the 1970s. Ms Grant's reason for not reclaiming the body of her stillborn baby? 'I don't trust their system', she told Narratively.","City authorities have been burying bodies on Hart Island since 1868 .

"Birmingham City have rejected a third bid worth up to £3.5million from Bournemouth for teenage winger Demarai Gray.

Bournemouth’s latest offer, following on from bids of £1.5m and £2m, saw £3m guaranteed, with add-ons potentially pushing the final transfer value to £3.5m. Birmingham value Gray much higher. Bournemouth have had a third bid of £3.5million for Demarai Gray rejected by Birmingham City . Gary Rowett has been consistent in his approach to Gray, who has seen increased game-time under the new Birmingham manager, insisting his current club is the right place for his development. Gray, a quick and technically-gifted player, has attracted plenty of attention since breaking through at St Andrew’s and announced himself to the Championship with a hat-trick against Reading in early December. Liverpool and Tottenham have maintained a watchful eye, while Crystal Palace had a £500,000 bid rejected last summer. Gray’s contract has 18 months left to run and his he is in discussions about an extension. Rowett has previously told Sportsmail: ‘He’s as good as any young player I’ve seen at this age. He gets the fans off the edge of their seats. I would expect if someone does want to buy him he’s not going to come cheap. There are not many young British players around who can go past people, are quick, and can score goals.’ Gray has scored four goals in 20 games for the Blues so far this season .

"Jose Mourinho has been charged with misconduct by the Football Association for his public comments after Chelsea's draw with Southampton in December. The charge comes after the Chelsea boss received a formal warning over his pre-match comments ahead of the Stoke game when he spoke of the need for a 'strong referee'. Mourinho was furious after Cesc Fabregas was booked for diving by referee Anthony Taylor during the 1-1 draw at St Mary's on December 28 when replays showed he had been tripped by Matt Targett. Jose Mourinho (right) talks to his support staff after Cesc Fabregas was booked for diving against the Saints . Fabregas goes down in the penalty area after a challenge by Southampton youngster Matt Targett . Fabregas was booked by Premier League official Anthony Taylor for an apparent dive during the second half . The Chelsea boss claimed: 'It is a scandal because it is not a small penalty, it is a penalty like Big Ben. It was a big mistake with a big influence on the result. 'I will go to the referee and wish him a good year and tell him he will be ashamed. It is clearly the result of something that looks like a campaign.' The FA's disciplinary department have taken their time but charged him on Thursday. The Chelsea midfielder reacts as referee Taylor shows him a yellow card during the match at St Mary's . An FA statement said: 'Jose Mourinho has been charged by The FA for misconduct in relation to media comments he made following Chelsea's game against Southampton on 28 December 2014. 'It is alleged his remarks constitute improper conduct in that they allege and/or imply bias on the part of a referee or referees and/or bring the game into disrepute.

'The FA has also reviewed pre-match comments made by Mr Mourinho on December 19 2014 prior to Chelsea's game against Stoke City and, having sought his observations on this matter, decided not to bring a disciplinary charge and instead issued him with a formal warning. 'The FA prohibit participants from making any pre-match media comments including comments of a positive nature concerning the appointed match officials for a particular fixture. Whether the official is identifiable by name or by implication, these are deemed to amount to improper conduct in breach of FA Rule E3.' Mourinho was in trouble with the FA twice last season.

"It took until the end of December before Neil Warnock became the first Barclays Premier League manager sacked this season but the overall trend towards greater managerial instability still deepens, especially at Championship clubs. Across the top four tiers of English football, there were 34 managerial changes and 27 dismissals between the start of the season and December 31. This beats the previous high of 24, set last season – and there were 12 dismissals in the Championship, which is also a record, five more than in the previous two years.

The numbers may be warped by unusual goings on at Watford (four different managers this season) and Leeds (three) but this season is on course to create a new record of managerial departures, set at 46 in 2006-07. One of the most disturbing trends for the League Managers Association, which released these figures today as part of its quarterly review, is that those managers dismissed during the current campaign were only in their jobs for an average of 1.04 years. The average for those sacked in the top three tiers has been less than a year. Mark Yeates, fired from Cheltenham after nearly five years, and Paul Cox, who departed Mansfield after more than three, boosted the average tenure figures in League Two. Thirteen of the 27 dismissals have been managers serving for the first time in the top four divisions of English football. Will they return to the job? Really, why would you?

"Arsenal are bracing themselves for a battle with the Home Office as they look to seal a move for Gabriel Paulista. The Gunners were on Wednesday close to agreeing a deal with Villareal for the central defender, who has a £15million release clause. But the biggest stumbling block towards a deal will be securing the Brazilian a work permit. Villarreal's Gabriel Paulista (right) could be heading for Arsenal if they can secure a work permit . Paulista (left) fights for the ball with FC Zurich ace Marco Schonbacher during a Europa League group game . The 24-year-old has not played a senior match for his country, and hence will have great difficulty in obtaining a work permit. However, Arsenal are set to appeal any such decision in their attempts to land Paulista this month. Should the FA, who rule on behalf of the Home Office in such cases, refuse to grant the defender the necessary paperwork to play in the UK, the Gunners will then have to prove Paulista is an 'exceptional talent' in their bid to land him a permit. This will be easier said than done, however, given the Paulista has not played for Brazil. Rules state that only players who have played 75 percent of matches for a nation inside FIFA's top 70 within the past two years are eligible for work permits. Defender Paulista is yet to make a senior appearance for the Brazilian national side . Andrej Kramaric (centre) was allowed to join Leicester despite having only played four times for Croatia . Arsenal's attempts to secure the green light for Paulista to play in this country will make interesting viewing for the club's rivals. Seemingly, given the South American falls short of meeting the Home Office's criteria, other clubs would have reason to be perplexed should Paulista be granted permission to play in the Premier League. However, the Gunners could use Leicester's recent signing of Andrej Kramaric as precedent in an appeal process. There were major doubts over Leicester's capture of Kramaric earlier this month given he has just four caps for Croatia to his name. But the Foxes successfully argued to the FA that Kramaric was of 'exceptional talent' and eventually saw Wembley chiefs endorse their application.","Arsenal close to agreeing £15million deal for Villareal defender .

David Bryant, now 56, was dramatically sprung on Thursday after a Bronx judge ruled that his defense during hearings into the brutal rape and murder of an 8-year-old girl had been flawed. The man, who was just 18 when he was imprisoned, looked at an iPad and iPhone with amazement, according to the New York Post. Free man: David Bryant, 56, from Bronx, has been released from prison after serving 39 years for the murder of an 8-year-old girl he says he did not commit . 'Wow, this is all new!' Bryant said as he used the tablet. When he picked up a smart phone bought for him by the advocacy group that helped get him released, he remembered that in 1975 everyone dialed with a rotary phone. 'The last time I was out, it was ‘tick, tick, tick,'' Bryant said as he motioned with his hand. Food was also a surprise to the newly-released man. 'I couldn’t believe how much the size of the food has changed. Everything is so huge. Who can eat all that?' he said. 'I feel like I walked out of a time machine. Everything is totally different,' he told the New York Daily News. Bryant told the Post: 'Last night they took me to dinner at a nice restaurant, and the appetizers were more than we would eat for a week.' Incarcerated: Bryant, now 56, spent the last 38 years in Marcy prison in upstate New York . He spent the night of his release at the home of Centurion Ministries director Kate Germond. 'In there (prison) the bed was like a rock, and here last night the bed was so soft,' Bryant enthused. 'I’m like a little kid learning to walk again.' After being told he was a free man, Bryant shouted out cries of joy and revealed how his parents never believed he was innocent. According to the Post, he . tearfully said outside court: 'I just wanna go to church and get on my . knees and pray for my mother . and father because they never believed me. 'I wish they were alive today so that I could tell them that I didn’t do it.' The New York Times reports the judge found the failure of Bryant's attorney . to consult with a blood and semen testing expert deprived him of a fair . trial. Free at last: David Bryant cries tears of joy after being released from prison . The . then-18-year-old Bryant was arrested less than a day after the . discovery of New York City girl Karen Smith's body in the stairwell of . an apartment house. She'd been raped, beaten and stabbed. A spokesman for the Bronx district attorney's office says no decision has been made on appealing the judge's ruling. Bryant . was freed after the advocacy group, The Centurion Ministries, filed a . motion because it believed Bryant was wrongfully convicted. It claimed he received poor counsel . because Bryant's court-appointed lawyer did no question semen and blood . evidence which was picked up at the scene of the crime. It was discovered that Bryant's blood type did not match semen found at the scene where the youngster was killed. Tears of joy: David Bryant receives a hug from Kate Germond, from the Centurion Ministries, who fought hard alongside his legal team to get him released from prison . After being left shocked by the decision, Bryant realised he would quickly need to come to terms with how the world has changed during his time in prison. He said: 'You come out and you see all the changes and you don’t know if you’re going to make the adaptations to this new life.' To celebrate his new-found freedom, Bryant said he wanted a box of Kentucky Fried Chicken, biscuits, Dunkin' Donuts and Pepsi.","David Bryant was released from jail on Thursday .

"Kenny McDowall insists it was an 'honour' to be caretaker Rangers boss - but admits he needs a break from life at the Old Firm. Ally McCoist's former assistant has followed the axed manager's lead by handing in his resignation after just four games in charge. He now plans to work out the 12-month notice period written into his contract - but admits he has no idea if he will be put on garden leave like McCoist. Former Rangers caretaker manager Kenny McDowell admitted he needed a break from life at Ibrox . McDowall (left) had been assistant to Ally McCoist (right) but replaced the Scottish icon in December last year . The former Celtic youth coach has looked uneasy in the top job since being asked to take the team by the board last month. And he admits he needs time to clear his head following eight turbulent years at Ibrox, which started when Walter Smith lured him from Parkhead to become first-team coach. McDowall - who helped the club win three successive titles before the Glasgow giants were brought to their knees by the 2012 liquidation crisis - said: 'It wasn't an easy decision. It was one I discussed with the family and I just decided I was more than happy to honour my contract and work my 12 months. Before their liquidation nighmare in 2012 Rangers experienced great success in the Scottish Premier League . 'But the last four years have been tough. Everybody is aware of that. It was time to step aside. 'I've been nearly 18 years at the Old Firm. That's quite a long time and it does take its toll on you. I will have a break probably, but we will see.' He added: 'This is a massive job and it's an absolute honour to be sitting here as caretaker. That's what made it such a difficult decision.

"The Cincinnati Bengals' woeful post-season record continued on Sunday with a 26-10 loss to the Indianapolis Colts, the fourth straight year they have gone out in the wildcard round. The Bengals have to go back to the 1990 season, with a wildcard round win over the then Houston Oilers for their most recent play-off victory. Quarterback Andy Dalton, who has been the signal caller for all four of those wildcard losses, tried to put some perspective on the record but there was little hiding his deep disappointment. Cincinnati Bengals' Andy Dalton admitted his side were outplayed after losing 26-10 to Indianapolis Colts . Colts duo Sergio Brown (centre, left) and Montori Hughes celebrate during their win against the Bengals . 'Our goal here is not about one play-off game, it is far beyond that - it is about winning the Super Bowl,' said Dalton. 'To put ourselves in a position that only 12 teams were able to do this year and only 12 teams have been able to do the last four years, there is a sense of accomplishment there. 'But you are going to be judged on what you do in the play-offs and we haven't won yet and we are going to do everything we can to figure out how to get over this hump'. Dalton was without his two favorite targets with A.J. Green missing due to concussion and tight end Jermaine Gresham ruled out with a back injury.

'We couldn't get a drive going, we were in third and long situations and couldn't get that one play to get us the momentum,' added Dalton, who completed 18 of 35 passes for 155 yards. 'We worked really hard to get to this point. We felt like we were ready to go and had an opportunity and again it falls by the wayside.

"Caroline Wozniacki said she felt 'cursed' at Melbourne Park after losing in straight-sets to a resurgent Victoria Azarenka in the Australian Open second round on Thursday. The eighth-seeded Dane Wozniacki enjoyed making the semi-finals in 2011 but has since suffered diminishing returns in every trip to the year's first grand slam. She could certainly count herself unlucky to run into fellow former world number one Azarenka so early at Melbourne Park, the Belarusian floating like a mine in the draw, with no seeding and nothing to lose after an injury-blighted 2014. Caroline Wozniacki speaks to the press after losing to Victoria Azarenka in straight sets on Thursday . Wozniacki afterwards spoke of a curse she feels is over her after four bad years at the Australian Open . 'Obviously she feels great here,' Wozniacki told reporters of two-time champion Azarenka, who was a class above in the 6-4 6-2 win at Margaret Court Arena. 'I think it's a curse I've gotten here. I've made semis, then quarters (2012), then fourth round (2013), then third round (2014), this year second round. 'It's kind of gone that way the last few years. Hopefully I'm going to break that next year and start going the other way. 'I love this tournament and I'm so sad to be out already. Obviously it was a tough draw for both of us. But, you know, she came out on top and played better.' Azarenka pumps her fist after winning a point against Wozniacki in Melbourne on Thursday . Azarenka danced off court in celebration (left) after winning her second round match against Wozniacki . Wozniacki had worked hard to break back into the top 10 last year, reaching the final at the U.S. Open and raising hopes she might be able to compete with the likes of Serena Williams and Maria Sharapova after a couple of years in the wilderness. Instead, Australia gave her a crushing reality check and produced a familiar complaint that she had let herself be dominated by a hard-hitting opponent. 'In general, I think I did okay. But at the same time I felt like I let her dictate a little bit too much,' she said. 'She played cross-court, I played cross-court back. I let her dictate. I should have opened it up a little bit earlier and just tried to make her play my game. 'A loss is a loss. All losses suck. It doesn't feel fun to be here right now. 'I would rather completely suck and play terrible and win than play wonderfully and lose. I'm a competitor. It hurts to lose.' 'But it definitely feels much harder to lose this early as well.'","Caroline Wozniacki lost 6-4, 6-2 to Victoria Azarenka in Melbourne .

"Serena Williams had to dig deep in a tough first set before the world No 1 eventually eased over the finish line to progress to the third round of the Australian Open. Serena saved three set points against world No 203 Vera Zvonareva in the first set before battling back for a 7-5, 6-0 victory. Zvonareva, a former world No 2 from Russia, has been plagued by injury in recent years and now sits at a lowly ranking after playing just five tournaments last year. Serena Williams went from agony to ecstasy as she battled past Vera Zvonareva to reach the third round . Williams looked set to lose the opening set but she fought back well before running away with the second . But Williams made a sluggish start and appeared to struggle to serve into the sun as she went 5-3 down in the opening set. However, 33-year-old Williams showed her fighting qualities and saved three set points as she reeled off four games in a row to take the opening set in 58 minutes. Zvonareva never recovered and failed to win another game as Williams dominated to wrap up the match in one hour and 25 minutes. Williams said: 'She started out really well. She was really agressive and I was a little bit too passive. 'Once I got down, I said ""Serena, you have nothing to lose here, enjoy yourself"" and I started to play better.' Earlier, sister Venus also reached the last 32 as the 34-year-old beat compatriot Lauren Davis 6-2, 6-3 in one hour and 16 minutes. It is the 12th time Venus has progressed to the third round at Melbourne Park, though she has never won the title here, with her best performance being an appearance in the 2003 final against Serena. The earliest the two sisters can meet this year is in the semi-finals, although Venus will do well to get there considering she has a tricky encounter against feisty Italian Camila Giorgi next and a potential last-16 clash with No 6 seed Agnieszka Radwanska. Zvonareva failed to close out the first set and was blown away in the second as she crashed out in Melbourne . Venus will not be content, though, unless she leaves Melbourne a week on Sunday with the trophy in her hands. She said: 'For me, I've won in my life. I've won a lot of things. For me it's about titles, so no matter what the title is for me, [getting] to the finals is the same thing as the third round if I didn't win. 'For me, it's about hopefully trying to take titles home. Last year I got in the circle to hopefully [win] titles quite a few times and sometimes came up short. 'That's pretty much where I want to be. My focus really is how close can I get myself to be in that winner's circle.' Venus's resurgence - which included victory at the Auckland Classic two weeks ago - after being hindered by illness and injury in recent years - has also acted as motivation for her younger sibling. Serena said: 'She is really motivating. She is playing so well, she's doing so good right now. It makes me look behind my shoulders and I have to play better and I want to do better. 'I always want to be able to stay ahead as much as I can. So I think that's been, for our whole careers, we've kind of motivated each other. We hopefully continue to do that.'

"Steven Finn is relishing the chance to banish his Australian demons after turning in a five-star performance at the Gabba. Little more than a year ago Finn was losing his way completely Down Under as he struggled with his action and his confidence during a nightmare Ashes trip. And it was here in Brisbane that things reached their nadir, with Finn sent home early from the tour after then coach Ashley Giles deemed him 'unselectable'. England's Steven Finn acknowledges the Gabba crowd after taking five wickets for 33 runs against India . Finn celebrates with Ian Bell and Stuart Broad after taking the wicket of Ajinkya Rahane . But those harrowing days - and the gradual journey back - were put to one side as he claimed career-best ODI figures of five for 33 against Tri-Series rivals India, setting England on course for handsome nine-wicket win. Finn's steepling bounce was the decisive factor as India rolled over for 153, a total Ian Bell (88no) and James Taylor (56no) knocked off with ease. 'Obviously a lot has happened in the last 12 months and it's pretty much a year to the day that I went home from that tour of Australia,' he recalled, with a smile. 'But that corner's been turned and I feel like I turned it a little while ago. All that stuff's in the past now. 'To take five wickets was obviously very pleasing after the work I've put in, but I don't want to look back now, just forward.' It will be hard for the paceman to forget completely about his previous travails, with plenty of reminders on hand during the current series, and the World Cup to come. Finn (second left) celebrates the wicket of Rahane, caught by James Taylor (second right) But the prospect holds no fear now. 'To come here and be in the same hotels and get over those hurdles has been fun,' he said. 'I'm enjoying my time in Australia and to take wickets is obviously very good. 'There are a few bad memories knocking around in the places we're travelling to but this will help relax me. I'm happy with where I'm at now.' Finn's efforts, not to mention four wickets from the fit-again James Anderson and an effortlessly classy innings from Bell, handed Eoin Morgan a first win since taking over the captaincy from Alastair Cook. And Morgan was keen to praise his Middlesex team-mate for leading the charge. Stuart Broad, Taylor, Ian Bell, Joe Root and Finn (left to right) celebrate the wicket of  Rahane . 'If nothing else over the last 12 months, we've put together some outstanding individual performances - and today was no different with Steve,' he told Sky Sports 2. 'He found some rhythm early, and managed to take advantage of that steep bounce he gets. 'He's come a long way over the last two years....for him to produce performances like the ones I've seen at Middlesex throughout his whole career makes me very proud.' India captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni, whose day went downhill from the moment he won the toss and asked England to field, was disappointed with his under-performing top six. 'I don't think we batted well, especially after choosing to bat, ' he said. 'The wicket was a bit two-paced to start off and our batsmen did not really play well. We needed to build partnerships, but that did not happen. 'If a ball is there to hit, you should, but if it needs to be defended, you should watch out.'","Steven Finn was sent home from the Ashes in January 2014 .

"Rising star James Vince and Jonathan Trott shared a century stand to preserve England Lions' chances of drawing the second unofficial Test against South Africa A. The fourth-wicket pair joined forces still 80 runs behind, after Adam Lyth and Alex Lees had departed in quick succession following their own 77-run partnership on day three of four in Bloemfontein. Vince (61no) and Trott (53) responded by keeping the home attack at bay for almost 29 overs, the captain reaching his half-century with his seventh four off the 80th ball he faced before being lbw to Test off-spinner Dane Piedt to end a stand of 115. Jonathan Trott, pictured on Saturday during England Lions practice, scored 53 on the third day . Trott and James Vince (pictured) put on 115 runs as the rising star closed on 61 not out . Heavy rain and bad light restricted play after tea, the Lions eventually closing on 212 for four - but only 51 in front - with Vince still unbeaten, having completed his 110-ball 50 with his ninth boundary. Seamers Boyd Rankin (four for 78) and Liam Plunkett (three for 75) were earlier both in the wickets again as the hosts, resuming on 389 for seven, were all out for 421. Trott's tourists conceded a lead of 161 and were almost immediately in more trouble when Test opener Sam Robson edged Rory Kleinveldt on to his stumps for a golden duck, his second single-figure failure of the match. Captain Trott and Vince ensure England go into the final day with a realistic chance of earning a draw . Seamer Boyd Rankin took four for 78 as South Africa A scored 421 in the second innings . Opener Lyth and Lees tried to effect a lasting recovery, but the Lions were 81 for three after the Yorkshire left-handers fell in the space of two overs to teenage seamer Kagiso Rabada. Lyth edged an attempted drive to slip, and then Lees was bowled off his pads.

"Legendary former England skipper Mike Brearley wants captains to halt abusive sledging and aggressive gestures at the World Cup. David Warner’s spat with India batsman Rohit Sharma on Sunday — when the Australian repeatedly screamed at Sharma to ‘speak English’ — was the latest piece of boorish on-field behaviour and now Brearley is calling on captains such as England’s Eoin Morgan to tell players to cut out the verbals. Brearley wields considerable influence as chairman of the International Cricket Council’s world cricket committee. And ECB president Giles Clarke, as well as Cricket Australia chief executive James Sutherland, have agreed to put the idea on the agenda for the ICC meeting on January 28-29. Dennis Lillee of Australia and Pakistan's Javed Miandad clash during a Test match back in 1981 . Shane Warne (right) has a heated exchange with Marlon Samuels during a Big Bash League match in 2013 . David Warner and Rohit Sharma exchange words during Australia's clash with India in Melbourne . If the ICC agree, an edict could come in before the World Cup starts in Melbourne on February 14, when England meet Australia. Sin-bins are also being considered. Brearley said: ‘It comes down to respect, for the umpires, the opposition, the viewers and one’s own team. I hate the sneering and mocking and the curled lip, as much as what is said, or what is done in terms of action. ‘This is a good time to remind people of the Play Hard, Play Fair Spirit of Cricket motto, both because Phillip Hughes’s shocking death should make people rethink their values and because of the World Cup. The important thing is that people are consistent and, if given out, they leave the arena promptly and get on with the game quickly.’ The ICC are considering tougher sanctions and Clarke said: ‘The CEOs plan to have Geoff Allardice, the head of cricket, brief referees and umpires. They will be told zero tolerance for bad behaviour and it is their job to enforce that.’ Warner was unhappy after India took a single when when he felt the ball deflected off Sharma's pads . BBC cricket correspondent Jonathan Agnew was criticised by Australia players Chris Rogers and Xavier Doherty for linking Hughes’s death with flashpoints in the recent Australia-India series. But seven players have been punished in the last month including Warner, MS Dhoni, Virat Kohli and Ishant Sharma. Agnew said: ‘I am not critical of Michael Clarke but the posturing and unnecessary gesturing appeared to be as bad as ever in the last series. ‘The ICC plan to bring in strict anti-sledging regulations in time for the World Cup, but it is a shame the players have not felt prompted to act themselves.’ David Gower, the former England skipper, said: ‘Asking the captains to hold fire is a good idea but we’ll have to look at the small print. You have to find the balance between what is acceptable and what isn’t.’ Sharma and Warner were separated by the umpires after tempers flared between the pair . Certainly foul abuse on the field flies in the face of the Corinthian spirit that cricket is supposed to uphold. Australia captain Clarke acknowledged as much when he made his heart-wrenching address at the funeral of Hughes. Clarke said: ‘His spirit, which is now part of the game for ever, will act as a custodian of the sport we all love. We must listen to it. We must cherish it. We must learn from it.’ Unfortunately, a cult has emerged in this most gentlemanly of sports. It gives bowlers licence to charge down the pitch, arms waving, before stopping a yard from the bemused batsman and shouting ‘f*** off!’ When England’s Jim Laker took the final wicket in his incredible haul of 19 for 90 against Australia at Old Trafford in 1956, he turned and took his sweater from the umpire, then walked off without histrionics. I used to write his column in the Daily Sketch and he explained: ‘Well, that’s how we did it then.’ Former England cricket captain Mike Brearley, picutred in 1981, has called to stamp out sledging . I’ve played cricket with Giles Clarke, for the Forty Club which has 2,400 members who pass on the message of sportsmanship and fair play to schools. I suggested to him it might be a good idea to persuade the international captains, the boards, the MCC and the ECB to call a halt to abusive behaviour. They could call it the Phillip Hughes Declaration or Accord. Clarke said my idea was ‘firmly on the agenda at the next ICC meeting’. He promises zero tolerance in the World Cup but will it last? Australia have always bred strong characters who love sports and hate losing. They love provoking the opposition, particularly the English, through word and action. Gideon Haigh, the eminent Australian cricket writer, believes sledging has become more barbed as a result of the high stakes in the Indian Premier League. England cricketer Jimmy Anderson (right) has been accused of sledging . He said ‘Administrators and the media have an ambivalent relationship with on-field aggression. They affect to deplore it but in truth they know it sells.’ And, frankly, the ECB have been allowing their cricketers, England fast bowler Jimmy Anderson especially, to run amok. The ICC have 10 full members, 38 associate members and 57 affiliated countries, almost half of the world, and they expect a billion television viewers to watch the World Cup final in Melbourne on March 29. How many of these will be turned off by watching what Agnew calls ‘the verbal abuse, the posturing and the unnecessary gesturing which appeared to be as bad as ever (in the recent Australia-India series)’? One stroke — not a hook or a cut but a common sense consensus — could stop this nonsense in a trice. The laws say the captain is responsible for the behaviour of his players, so speak up Michael Clarke, Eoin Morgan and the rest!

"West Brom have tabled a £5million offer for Leicester striker Jamie Vardy. New Baggies boss Tony Pulis has identified the forward as potential signing this month as he seeks to beef up his attacking options. And it is understood WBA have made an offer for Vardy, though the bid is understood to have been rebuffed. Jamie Vardy (right) battles with Stoke's Marc Muniesa, and has featured 20 times for Leicester City this season, starting in the Foxes' 1-0 home defeat by Stoke in the Barclays Premier League on Saturday . Vardy celebrates his only goal of this season which came in the 5-3 win over Manchester United in September . Vardy, who can also play out wide, has scored just once for the Foxes this season, having struck in the famous 5-3 victory over Manchester United in September. Pulis is keen to freshen up his his attack having taken over managerial duties from Alan Irvine this month - and will offload deadwood to help finance transfers. The Baggies are willing to listen to offers for club record signing Brown Ideye, who Tony Pulis says 'has a cloud hanging over him at the moment'. Tony Pulis is keen to add to his West Brom attack and ease the goal scoring burden on Saido Berahino (left), who above celebrates a goal against Hull earlier in January . A move for Vardy could involve Brown Ideye leaving the Baggies, who has flopped at the Hawthorns this term . Ideye missed a glorious chance against Hull to justify some of his £10million fee and has looked bereft of confidence since joining from Dynamo Kiev last summer. Pulis is determined to bring in a striker to share the goal burden on Saido Berahino this transfer window, and Ideye could leave to raise funds. 'I can't say he's staying,' said Pulis. 'If someone comes in and offers an enormous amount of money the club looks at it. That's the same with every player. Every club I've been at has worked that way. Pulis will have more time to assess his attackers on Monday night when the Baggies travel to Everton to help wrap up the weekend's Barclays Premier League fixtures.","Leicester City understood to have rejected £5million offer for Jamie Vardy .

"Everton defender Leighton Baines admits the forthcoming warm-weather training break is a chance for players to generate a greater team spirit. A dire goalless draw at home to West Brom extended the Toffees' win-less run to eight matches and the England left-back accepts the growing criticism may have led some players to look after themselves. Cracks seemed to appear against the Baggies when Kevin Mirallas stepped up to take a penalty - traditionally the role of Baines with 15 successful conversions from 16 - and hit the post. Leighton Baines (left) and Kevin Mirallas speaking ahead of the penalty at Goodison Park on Monday night . Mirallas misses from the penalty spot having stolen the ball from usual penalty taker Baines . Forwards Steven Naismith and Romelu Lukaku tried to persuade the Belgium international he was making a mistake and after his failure Lukaku could be seen publicly questioning his international team-mate with manager Roberto Martinez on the touchline. With no FA Cup action this weekend the squad are heading overseas for an intensive few days training and that break may now be more important than ever. ""It is like a mini pre-season in a way,"" said Baines. ""We have been spending a lot of time together anyway but to go away is a nice change of scenery. Romelu Lukaku (left)  battles for the ball with Joleon Lescott and Steven Naismith (right) takes a breather . ""Hopefully it gets a bit more spirit among the lads and keeps everyone together because when you are not winning games and there is a lot of criticism it is easy to look after yourself. ""We have to stay together and look after each other and hopefully this trip will be beneficial in all those ways."" The players will be challenged in a number of areas while they are away, not least in terms of why they have fallen so far off the pace they set last season. ""It is similar to what we did last season. We'll have some hard sessions in the morning and some tactical stuff in the afternoon,"" he told evertontv. Everton's Muhamed Besic (right) and West Bromwich Albion's James Morrison battle for the ball . ""It is a chance to go away, take a step back and look at where we are going wrong because we are going wrong at the moment and it gives us more time together to put things right, . ""The intention is to have more opportunity to put more work in and cover some more points that we need to address so hopefully it will be beneficial."" Goodison Park has so often been Everton's stronghold but this season they have taken just 14 points from 11 matches and the West Brom display was arguably the worst seen at home under Martinez. Pressure is growing on Everton manager Roberto Martinez following their poor run of form . Discontent is becoming more audible by the week but the Toffees boss could not say whether that was impacting on the players. ""It is difficult to answer that. We all share the same frustration,"" he said. ""We want to win the game and perform well. The players had the perfect attitude and mindset that allowed us to control the game. ""You don't see many games in the Premier League when the opposition has no shots on target. ""The second half we all got frustrated, the players to the crowd and vice-versa."" Tony Pulis issues instructions to Chris Baird from the touchline during the Monday night draw with Everton . The penalty furore took much of the focus away from another well-drilled West Brom performance which had all the hallmarks of new manager Tony Pulis. Since he took over earlier this month they have not conceded a goal in three matches and the former Stoke and Crystal Palace boss is still unbeaten. ""As a group you can't criticise them in any shape,"" Pulis said. ""Everybody has bought into what we are trying to do. It takes time. ""This is a real struggle down at the bottom. There are so many good teams down there and I think it will go to the wire.""

"Tottenham set up a fifth round tie with Manchester United in the FA Youth Cup after goals from Ismail Azzaoui and Kyle Walker-Peters saw off Wolves on Thursday night. The London side's comfortable win at Dagenham completes the last 16 line-up in the prestigious youth competition and keeps them in contention for a fourth triumph. Belgian youth international Azzaoui fired Spurs into a 10th-minute lead when he seized onto Anthony Georgiou's through pass and swept the ball past goalkeeper Harry Burgoyne and into the far corner.

Their lead could have been doubled later in the first-half when 15-year-old centre-half Japhet Tanganga saw his shot from Georgiou's right-sided cross blocked. Azzaoui also saw an effort pushed onto the post by Burgoyne in stoppage time as Spurs pushed for their second of the night. Tottenham continued to be the better side after the break and the lively Azzaoui saw another shot blocked by the Wolves goalkeeper at his near post, with Cy Goddard seeing his rebound blocked. But, just a couple of minutes later, Spurs did gain a contest-killing second goal when Goddard threaed the ball into Walker-Peters and he fired high inside the near post. It would have been three had Burgoyne not been alert when Spurs substitute Ryan Loft was played in behind the Wolves defence.

"Steven Fletcher says there is a buzz around Sunderland following Jermain Defoe's arrival. Keen to return home after an ill-fated spell in Major League Soccer with Toronto, Gus Poyet's side fought off competition from a host of other Barclays Premier League clubs to sign the England international.

'He is a great player and I think hopefully a few of the boys will learn off him as well. 'We changed our formation a bit for the game and it was working well but we switched off for a minute and they punished you with a great finish. 'Obviously we got a bit more space.

"Former European hurdles champion Rhys Williams insists he should not have been suspended for having a banned substance in his system due to a contaminated supplement. Williams and fellow Welshman Gareth Warburton were 'at fault or negligent' in failing to check supplements they took in an energy drink contained banned substances, according to a UK Anti-Doping (UKAD) official report which was published on Monday. The pair failed drugs tests last summer - forcing the athletes to miss both the Commonwealth Games and the European Championships. Although their bans were reduced as it was accepted they did not knowingly use banned substances, Williams, 30, received a suspension of four months with Warburton, 31, banned for six months. Rhys Williams competing in the Men's 400m heats of the 2013 IAAF World Athletic Championships in 2013 . Both athletes are now clear to compete again after admitting their careers would have been over had the maximum four-year ban for serious cases of intentional doping been handed out, but Williams - who won European 400m hurdles gold at Helsinki in 2012 - still feels he has done nothing wrong and that the punishment was harsh. 'I have to accept what the suspension is but if you ask me I shouldn't have had one,' Williams said. 'They found something in my body that was a nanogram amount of a veterinary substance which stays in your body for nine months, so it was definitely not something a 400-metre hurdler would take to get a performance. 'It's all bizarre and it's impossible to foresee a small amount in a supplement that's got labelling. 'I think I've already served more than enough punishment by missing the Commonwealth Games and the European Championship. 'But I'm relieved now I can compete this season because I thought it could be the end of my athletics career, even though I'd done nothing wrong.' Cardiff athlete Williams had just given a speech as Wales athletics team captain on the eve of the 2014 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow when he was told he had tested positive for a banned substance. Williams can now return to action after having his ban reduced to four months . The next day he was on the plane home from the team's pre-Games base in Portugal, fighting to save his career and launching a campaign which he says has cost him £100,000 when you add up legal fees and loss of track earnings and sponsorship. 'I've never cried so much in my life and it also left my wife and coach in tears, it's been very upsetting for the whole family,' said Williams, the son of Wales rugby legend JJ. 'I don't think any athlete realises how bad it can be until it happens to you. 'What I don't want is people to associate me with drugs as I've proved where the cross-contamination has come from, but I know some people won't care about the facts. 'Google my name now and the first thing that comes up is doping. 'I've been in the British senior team since 2005 and done a lot of good things but this has ruined my reputation and that's what I am trying to get back. 'I want to turn this whole thing into a positive and educate athletes in not making the same mistake, because if it can happen to me who's done all the physical checks then it can happen to anyone.' Fellow Welshman Gary Warburton was also banned for six months for inadvertently taking a supplement . Williams says he is now focused on resuming his track career ahead of this year's World Championships in Beijing but, like Warburton, admits he will not be using supplements in the future. 'UK Anti-Doping have got to be seen to set an example and something was found in my body,' Williams said. 'I can't deny that and I've accepted that, but thankfully I've proved where the cross-contamination has come from. 'My aim now is to get back in that British team, do well at the World Championships and then look at the Olympics in Rio.' Warburton said his suspension was two months longer than Williams' because he was told he had not made as many checks on the supplement concerned as his international colleague. The 800m runner from north Wales said he was not bothered about the finger of suspicion being pointed at him and insisted he was a clean athlete. 'Everyone who knows us has been behind us and knows we haven't done anything wrong,' said Warburton, who competed for Great Britain at the London 2012 Olympics. 'It won't affect me. People can say what they want but my shoulders are broad and I'll concentrate on my own career. 'It's been a nightmare six months and it's cost a ridiculous amount of money to clear my name. 'But I would have paid anything to do that because I don't want people thinking I'm a cheat.' UKAD director of legal Graham Arthur said in a statement: 'These cases send a powerful reminder to athletes that there is no guarantee that any supplement product is free from banned substances. 'Athletes are strongly advised to be very cautious if they choose to use any supplement product and must undertake thorough research of any products before use. 'Information revealed as a result should be further investigated and we advise athletes to keep evidence of their research. 'The principle of strict liability dictates athletes are responsible for any substance found in their body.'","Rhys Williams was banned for  taking a contaminated supplement .

"There was no better place than the Gabba for Steven Finn to show he really can overcome the problems that threatened to nip his England career in the bud. It was here in Brisbane last year that Finn was sent home from an Ashes tour where he failed to make a single international appearance and was branded ‘unselectable’ by England after his action had virtually fallen apart. The road back has been long and tough for a man who was once among the most promising and potent fast bowlers in the world — but this was the day when he took giant strides towards re-igniting his career. England's Steven Finn acknowledges the Gabba crowd after taking five wickets for 33 runs against India . Finn celebrates with Ian Bell and Stuart Broad after taking the wicket of Ajinkya Rahane .

Ian Bell guides a shot beyond wicketkeeper MS Dhoni as England chased down India's total . Finn was outstanding as England brushed India aside with a nine-wicket victory on Tuesday. They took a significant step towards the tri-series final and, crucially, showed ahead of the World Cup that they can compete against one of the one-day powerhouses. This does not suddenly make England World Cup contenders but a thumping win over the defending champions, so emphatic it gained them a bonus point, was a welcome step forward for a team still with much to prove. At the centre of it was Finn, who took his first five-wicket haul in one-day internationals, including the key scalps of Virat Kohli and MS Dhoni. And to think he was so ineffective against Australia in Sydney and might well have missed out had illness not stopped Chris Jordan from playing. Only two days ago Finn looked a disconsolate figure as he bowled in an empty net at practice, occasionally stopping for some pep talks with guest motivator Andrew Flintoff, while the other bowlers went through their paces. Jordan’s misfortune was Finn’s gain but it would be wrong to suggest he is back to his very best. His old habit of smashing his right knee into the stumps in his delivery stride briefly resurfaced. Only two years ago in New Zealand he was being talked of as the first England bowler to break the 100mph mark, but here his bowling was almost 20mph below that. Jimmy Anderson celebrates after bowling India's Bhuvneshwar Kumar for five runs . India's Mahendra Singh Dhoni edges a Finn delivery to Jos Buttler (left) after making 34 runs . The crowd watches with baited breath as Moeen Ali takes the catch from Mohammed Shami for one run . Stephen Finn's figures of 5-33 are the second-best by an England bowler in an ODI in Australia. The best - Chris Woakes' 6-45 in 2011 - also came at the Gabba. Yet he was accurate and hit the right lengths to prove almost unplayable for an Indian line-up who looked as though Australian conditions were completely alien to them — rather than a side who played a Test at the Gabba only last month. Finn said: ‘There have been a few bad memories knocking around at places we have been to since we came back here but hopefully this will help to re-align me. I’m enjoying being in Australia this time. ‘A lot’s happened in the last 12 months. It’s pretty much a year to the day since I went home from Australia. But that corner’s been turned and all that stuff’s in the past. I want to look forward and I think I’m getting there. I might have another couple of miles per hour in the tank but that should come with confidence. I hope to get into my stride as the tour goes on.’ Anderson reaches but can't take a catch off MS Dhoni as India gained a reprieve . Finn celebrates with his team-mates after taking the wicket of Axar Patel (right) Patel was bowled first ball by Finn as England finished off the Indian order for 153 runs . Broad was unable to claim a wicket despite plenty of hard toil during his seven overs . He paid tribute to Flintoff, who clearly relished being involved again and could be seen with his two boys milling around the outfield seeking autographs after the game. ‘I have never really spoken to Freddie about cricket before and it was great to have him at the nets,’ said Finn. ‘To tap into his knowledge and get the perspective of someone outside the bubble was refreshing.’ Jimmy Anderson, back for his first international appearance since last summer, set the tone and emphasised how important he will be to England’s World Cup hopes with a probing spell of new-ball swing bowling.

Then Finn took over, taking three of the four Indian wickets to fall in 24 balls and adding two more in successive deliveries as England looked a potent force, possibly for the first time in the 50-over game since they lost the Champions Trophy final to India almost two years ago. Finn finished with five for 33 and would have had a sixth wicket had Kumar Dharmasena detected a gloved catch from Stuart Binny while Anderson, easing his way back from a knee injury, was superb in taking four for 18. England were superior in every department, Eoin Morgan’s excellent day in the field ending with an outstanding outfield catch that was then surpassed by an even better one from Moeen Ali. Once India had tumbled out for 153, England romped home with a stonking 135 balls and nine wickets in hand.

Ian Bell may have been out first ball in Sydney but here he was more like the man who scored 187 against a Prime Minister’s XI in Canberra last week. He benefited from a pop-gun attack to reach 88 in an unbeaten partnership of 131 with James Taylor. India, it must be said, were awful, with Dhoni having one of his baffling days as captain, relying far too heavily on the innocuous medium-pace of Binny rather than throwing his fastest bowler Umesh Yadav at England. India need to win their last two games to have any chance of reaching the final, while England travel to Hobart in good heart to play on Friday against an Australian side missing Mitchell Johnson, David Warner and George Bailey. It is early days, but England can take considerable encouragement from this.","England beat India by nine wickets in latest World Cup warm-up .

"West Ham United's move to the Olympic Stadium is being hailed as a step to the future by the club's owners. And finally the dream to turn the Olympic Stadium into a world class football stadium is taking shape as the Hammers' look to become a club capable of challenging Europe's elite. West Ham co-owner David Sullivan revealed astonishing ambition earlier this week, claiming that the stadium should help the club fight for titles and European trophies within five years. To many fans, including those who support the Hammers, it was taken with a pinch of salt. But why not? The move to the Olympic Stadium certainly gives them the foundations to work with. VIDEO Scroll down to watch West Ham United's Olympic Stadium timelapse . The original stadium, which was designed as a largely temporary venue and never intended to host Premier League football, cost £429million to build, with the conversion costing a further £154m. But when complete, the facilities on offer will be the benchmark for luxury hospitality in world football, providing seats with unrivalled views of the action. To start with the West Ham faithful were cautious when it came to walking away from the Boleyn Ground, a place they have called home since 1904. But impressive membership sales hints that fans have been won over by the visions of the club, accepting that it's time to move on if they want their side to be competing with Europe's elite. The Olympic Stadium is costing £154m to convert into West Ham's home but could require a further £15m . The Olympic Stadium glows in the shadow of east London and the surrounding areas . Already membership for The Royal East lounge has completely sold out, less than four months since it went on sale, and following the form of The Forge 1895 lounge which reached capacity in December.

West Ham will leave the Boleyn Ground and move into the stadium in time for the 2016-2017 season . Work to turn the stadium into a suitable home for a football team continues . And The Boleyn, the club's dedicated matchday fan bar, has also been a popular choice with more than a quarter of the tickets already snapped up.

"Rangers have launched an immediate investigation after goalkeeper Steve Simonsen was hit with two SFA charges for alleged breaches of gambling rules. The Englishman is said to have put money on 55 matches, although none involved Rangers, and the SFA insist there is no suggestion the Ibrox player was involved in any of the matches he is accused of betting on. The 35-year-old is accused of placing bets on 18 matches between January 15 and June 22 last year as well as a further 37 games between September 6 last year and January 13 this year. Rangers golakeeper Steve Simonsen charged by Scottish Football Association with breaching gambling rules . Simonsen jumps to try and save a shot during Rangers' match against Hearts last month . A principal hearing date has been set for Thursday, February 12, with the former Dundee man having until January 29 to respond to the charges. Simonsen is the third Scottish-based player to have been hit with such charges in recent times. In September 2013, Ibrox team-mate Ian Black was fined £7,500 and given a 10-game ban, seven of which were suspended, after admitting gambling on over 160 games over a seven-year period. Three of those matches included betting against his own team to win. Despite the anger of many Rangers fans at that revelation, the former Hearts midfielder continued to play under Ally McCoist. The goalkeeper sits on the bench of the match against Dumbarton with a black eye . Simonsen has been charged with placing 18 bets last season and also 37 this campaign . Last season, then Ayr United forward Michael Moffat was handed a six-match ban, reduced to four on appeal, after being found guilty of betting on 150 games between February 19, 2012 and September 1, 2013. He has since signed for Dunfermline. Simonsen, who counts Tranmere, Everton and Stoke among his former clubs, is enjoying an extended run in the Rangers team with first-choice Cammy Bell currently sidelined through injury. A Rangers spokesman said that ‘the club is aware of the SFA’s notice of complaint and is currently investigating the matter’. The keeper has been charged under SFA rules 31 and 33. Simonsen sits at a Rangers press conferenc in October and answers questions from the media . Disciplinary Rule 33 (from season 2013/14) states: No club, official, Team Official or other member of Team Staff, player, match official or other person under the jurisdiction of the Scottish FA shall bet in any way on a football match (except authorised and registered football pools). Disciplinary Rule 31 (2014/15) states: No club, official, Team Official or other member of Team Staff, player, match official or other person under the jurisdiction of the Scottish FA shall gamble in any way on a football match. Any such club or person to have engaged in gambling of any description on football shall be in breach of this rule. While players in England are allowed to bet on football competitions they are not involved in, the SFA has a zero tolerance rule that bans players in Scotland from betting on any matches. In other developments at Ibrox it emerged the Rangers Supporters Trust has announced it has now passed the one-million share threshold after buying up another chunk of shares in the club.","Steve Simonsen is charged by Scottish Football Association .

"Rangers fans will only be able to buy tickets for their forthcoming trip to Raith Rovers direct from the Kirkcaldy club — amid fears the stricken Glasgow giants could soon slide into insolvency again. In normal circumstances, Rovers would hand the Ibrox outfit a substantial allocation of briefs which Rangers would then sell on to their own fans before reimbursing the Fifers at a later date. However, it’s understood the Stark’s Park club have been concerned by suggestions of another financial collapse at Ibrox and that Rangers may not be in a position to fulfil their obligations. Mike Ashley's plans to increase lending from £10m to £13m have been met with opposition by Ibrox support . Rangers are currently in discussions with Raith Rovers over ticket sales for the upcoming league match . Rangers are said to need £6.5 million just to see them through until the summer and, as things stand, are in no position to meet next Thursday’s payroll obligations. The club required an emergency loan of £500,000 from director Sandy Easdale to avoid being wound-up by Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs (HMRC) earlier this month, although this has since been paid back from the funds raised by selling Lewis Macleod to Brentford. Plans by Mike Ashley to increase his lending by £10m to £13m have been strongly resisted by the Ibrox support, with the Newcastle owner seeking security over Ibrox and Murray Park. And, with no obvious solution to the growing financial crisis at Ibrox, Rovers have moved to insulate themselves ahead of the clash on February 20 by ensuring the proceeds from ticket sales goes straight into their hands. Briefs will go on sale at Stark’s Park on Tuesday, January 27. Ashley wants to use the Ibrox Stadium and club's training ground as security against his loan . A Rangers spokesperson said on Wednesday: ‘The club are currently in discussions with Raith Rovers on this matter.’ Meanwhile, the Rangers Fans Fighting Fund will back The Rangers Supporters Trust with hard cash if need be in their bid to keep Ibrox out of Ashley’s clutches. A spokesman for the group said: ‘The Rangers Fans Fighting Fund was launched by Ibrox legends Walter Smith and Sandy Jardine in 2012 to help safeguard and protect the club’s future and assets. ‘In recent days it has become crystal clear that the club’s current board is considering the use of Ibrox Stadium and Murray Park in order to secure a further loan from Mike Ashley. ‘Mr Ashley already has security over Edmiston House and the Albion Car Park and the RFFF, like almost all Rangers supporters, feels securitising our historic stadium and training ground is a step too far. ‘Ibrox, in our view, is sacrosanct. It is a memorial to the 66 who lost their lives (in the Ibrox Disaster). Rangers First supporters group protest in the hope of saving the future of their club . ‘Some of the greatest names in Scottish football history have graced the hallowed turf down the years and it should never be used as collateral in order to secure a loan that is not in the best interests of the club. ‘For that reason, the RFFF confirms it is willing to provide support and assistance to any fan group determined to protect the club’s assets. ‘We enjoyed a positive meeting with representatives from the Rangers Supporters Trust yesterday and we have agreed to back their initiative to prevent the securitisation of Ibrox and Murray Park.’ A statement on the RST website expressed its delight and gratitude to the RFFF’s backing and vowed: ‘We will work closely with the RFFF going forward to ensure every avenue is explored. The RST is not taking this action for the benefit of only its own members but for every Rangers fan and fan group. Former Rangers director Paul Murray is another person to have put his support behind the scheme . ‘Derek Llambias, Barry Leach, David Somers and James Easdale should be under no illusions that we will examine every available legal remedy to stop them passing our club’s assets to Mr Ashley.’ On Wednesday, Sandy and James Easdale responded to oldco director Paul Murray’s assertion that their days are numbered as he, too, pledged his support to the RST and Rangers First groups. A statement released on behalf of the Rangers football board chairman and director said: ‘So, like an episode of The Living Dead, Paul Murray emerges from his borders lair having vowed never to return. He says he expects a smear campaign against himself and Dave King and in the same breath compares the Rangers board to Gerald Ratner. Hypocritical? You decide. ‘If Mr Murray and Mr King ever do get anywhere near the club they are welcome to carry out a robust financial investigation. The Easdale brothers have never taken a penny from the club and nor have they claimed any expenses. ‘One begins to wonder if we are not dealing with Paul McKenna as opposed to Paul Murray who appears to have hypnotised himself and his cohorts into obliterating the memory fact that they sold their beloved club for One Pound. Rangers men? You decide.’","Rangers travel to Raith Rovers in the Scottish Championship February 20 .

"The Rangers power struggle took another twist on Wednesday as director Sandy Easdale revealed he had received 'several threats'. The 47-year-old provided a £500,000 crisis-loan for the cash-strapped club earlier this month but has since found himself the object of supporters ire, and now the police have been forced to step in after he was threatened online. The police are investigating internet posts that allegedly encouraged Rangers supporters to attack Easdale's home and force him out of the club. Sandy Easdale (left) revealed he had received 'several threats' and had called the police as a result . In a statement to the BBC, Easdale said: 'I have received several threats that are now in the hands of the authorities and I am confident that Police Scotland will get to the bottom of this. 'I appreciate that feelings are running high but I would like to make an appeal for calm. 'This sort of behaviour is not in the best interests of the club, its shareholders or its true supporters.' The 47-year-old provided a £500,000 crisis-loan for the cash-strapped club earlier this month . Easdale admitted he was not the only Rangers board member to suffer at the hands of the public, claiming all involved had been 'subjected to an unprecedented level of abuse'. Easdale increased his stake on in the club on Tuesday after buying up more than one million shares. The purchase means he now owns just over 5,250,000 shares - or just less than 6.5 per cent.

"Blackburn could find themselves in hot water with the FA after a fan appeared to throw a flare which landed near a group of Bolton fans during the Boxing Day derby. Bolton released a statement on Saturday, saying: 'Bolton Wanderers and the police are aware of the incident in the South Stand and where a device was thrown at the window of a box. 'We will be reviewing CCTV footage and will be sharing the information with police.' Smoke can be seen billowing out from corporate box after flare was thrown during Boxing Day derby . The flashpoint took place during the second half of Blackburn's 2-1 defeat at the Macron Stadium.

"Manager Mark Hughes is excited by the prospect of Stoke having Victor Moses and Bojan Krkic both fit and firing on the field at the same time. Following his summer arrival from Chelsea on a season-long loan deal, winger Moses established himself as the Potters' star performer in the early weeks of the campaign before he was sidelined by a thigh injury sustained towards the end of November. It was at that point that forward Bojan - a summer signing on a permanent deal from Barcelona - was just beginning to really show what he can do in a Stoke shirt, and he has subsequently emerged as their key attacking player in Moses' absence. Bojan Krkic (right) has been in impressive form for Stoke in recent weeks in his first season in England . Victor Moses hasn't featured for Stoke since November's Premier League defeat by Burnley . Moses made his return to the matchday squad as an unused substitute when the Staffordshire outfit suffered a 3-0 Barclays Premier League defeat at Arsenal last weekend, and he looks set for his playing comeback in Saturday's top-flight trip to Leicester. And Hughes said of the Nigeria international: 'He is very much in my thoughts for the weekend and hopefully, if he does play, he will be able to hit the performance levels that he was reaching prior to the injury, because he was arguably our best player. 'Thankfully Bojan had come into the team around the same time and took over that mantle, leading from the front with his level of performances. 'If we can get them both firing at the same time, then we should be in good shape.' The Nigeria international, on loan from Chelsea,injured his thigh and hasn't featured since . The former Barcelona forward has been one of Stoke's biggest attacking threats in Moses's absence . Stoke full-back Erik Pieters is a doubt but midfielder Steven Nzonzi should be available for Saturday's contest after both came off at half-time with groin complaints during the Arsenal match. Frontman Mame Biram Diouf remains on African Nations Cup duty with Senegal. Hughes' 11th-placed side take on a Leicester outfit who are bottom of the table. The Foxes were in that position on Christmas Day, and there have only been two seasons in Premier League history where the side in that predicament have gone on to avoid relegation. Hughes sees it as a 'tough call' as to whether or not Nigel Pearson's men - currently three points adrift of safety - will be able to beat the drop. Manager Mark Hughes is excited about the prospect of Bojan and Moses teaming up in the Stoke attack . But he has no doubt they will face Stoke in buoyant mood after defeating Hull and Aston Villa either side of drawing at Liverpool in their last three league games. 'It is a tough call - historically it is difficult to stay up when you have been bottom at Christmas,' said Hughes, whose team were beaten at home by Leicester in September. 'But it has been done in the past, and they will be encouraged by virtue of their last few games, when they have gone up against good teams and given a good account of themselves and, more importantly, picked up points.' Meanwhile, Hughes has played down the suggestion that talks over a new Stoke contract for midfielder Glenn Whelan - currently on a deal that runs out this summer - have broken down. 'There needs to be further discussions, but we are hopeful something will be resolved very quickly,' Hughes said.","Stoke City take on Leicester City in the Premier League on Saturday .

"With the arrival of the January transfer window comes an opportunity for managers to reassess their squads and strengthen where necessary. It brings the opportunity for Arsenal and Manchester United to sort out their defensive issues, for Tottenham to alleviate the pressure on Harry Kane, and for Chelsea and Manchester City to trim the dead wood. Here, Sportsmail's Simon Jones provides the details of the budgets and transfer targets of the Premier League's top six clubs. Chelsea are not actively looking to sign any players but retain an interest in Inter Milan forward Mauro Icardi . Andre Schurrle has struggled for form and game-time at Chelsea this season and could be sold . Mohamed Salah is wanted in a loan deal by QPR and Roma after failing to make his mark at Chelsea . CHELSEA . Chelsea's decisiveness in the summer transfer market led Jose Mourinho to claim he had no interest in adding to his squad in January. And considering the Blues have been top of the league since the first day you can't blame him. They are, however, interested in offloading players. BUDGET: £30m . TARGETS: NONE (but they like Mauro Icardi, Inter Milan) WHO’S GOING OUT: Mohamed Salah, possibly Roma, Loan; Andre Schurrle, possibly Schalke £23m . Manchester City are interested in former Chelsea man Kevin de Bruyne, who is now at Wolfsburg . Wilfried Bony, 26, joined Manchester City on a four-and-a-half-year deal, he will wear the No 14 shirt . Alexandre Lacazette has scored 22 goals in all competitions this season for Lyon . Scott Sinclair could finally about to end his nightmare spell at Manchester City . MANCHESTER CITY . After a slow start to the season that saw the champions slip as low as sixth in the table, Manuel Pellegrini's side have established some consistency and proved they can cope without star man injury-prone Sergio Aguero. Even so, the arrival of Wilfried Bony proves the club are not resting on their laurels. BUDGET: £25m . TARGETS: NONE (but they like Kevin de Bruyne, Wolfsburg £30m and Alexandre Lacazette, Lyon £23m) DONE: Wilfried Bony £28m . WHO’S GOING OUT: Scott Sinclair, Aston Villa £2m; John Guidetti, Celtic £3m; Matija Nastasic, Schalke, Loan . Elijero Elia, pictured in the win against Manchester United, has signed for Southampton on loan . Southampton are also interested in bringing in Braga's Rafa Silva, who would cost around £4m . SOUTHAMPTON . The predictions that Southampton would not be able to maintain their blistering start to the season have subsided. After beating Manchester United at Old Trafford, Ronald Koeman's side are third in the table, though they may need to add to the squad if they want to maintain their push for a Champions League spot. BUDGET: £15m . TARGETS: Rafa Silva, Braga, £4m, Tonny Vilhena, Feyenoord, £3m . DONE: Eljero Elia, Loan . WHO’S GOING OUT: NONE . Edinson Cavani is being trailed by a host of clubs including Manchester United, but would cost around £35m . Manchester United have had a long-standing interest in Dortmund defender Mats Hummels (right) Roma midfielder Kevin Strootman (right) is another target for the Manchester giants . Manchester United have already signed former Barcelona goalkeeper Victor Valdes . But the arrival of Valdes means Anders Lindegaard (left) could be heading for the exit . Southampton full back Nathaniel Clyne is a target for Louis van Gaal as he looks to strengthen his defence . MANCHESTER UNITED . Louis van Gaal and a host of summer signings have transformed the mood at Old Trafford, but this side is undeniably a work in progress. United are on track for their top-four finish but have struggled for consistency and may feel the need to add to the squad to continue their upward trajectory. BUDGET: £100m . TARGETS: NONE (but they like Mats Hummels, Borussia Dortmund £35m; Pablo Dybala, Palermo £30m; Edinson Cavani, PSG, £35m; Nathaniel Clyne £15m, Southampton; Kevin Strootman, Roma £40m) DONE: Victor Valdes . WHO’S GOING OUT: Darren Fletcher, possibly West Brom, £1m; Anders Lindegaard, possibly Molde £2m; Reece James, Loan . Arsenal may turn to West Ham defender Winston Reid to ease their injury problems at the back . Another long-term target for Arsene Wenger is Sporting Lisbon midfielder William Carvalho (left) Arsenal have agreed a fee for young Polish midfielder Krystian Bielik (centre) from Legia Warsaw . Joel Campbell (centre) could leave Arsenal after struggling to make appearances . ARSENAL . Arsenal fans are experiencing familiar emotions this season. Impressive performances have been interspersed with defensive horror-shows. An all-too-familiar injury crisis is in place at the club and supporters have been clamouring for Arsene Wenger to invest in his squad. BUDGET: £60m . TARGETS: Winston Reid, West Ham £6m; Hector Moreno Espanyol, £6m; Marcelo Brozovic, Dinamo Zagreb, £6m; William Carvalho, Sporting £18m; James McCarthy, Everton £25m . DONE: Krystian Bielik, Legia Warsaw £2.4m . WHO’S GOING OUT: Joel Campbell, possibly Real Sociedad, Loan . Both Arsenal and Tottenham are interested in Everton midfielder James McCarthy . Tottenham could turn to Burnley striker Danny Ings in a bid to alleviate pressure on Harry Kane . Tottenham are listening to offers for skipper Younes Kaboul just five months after he was given the armband . Another player who doesn't appear to be in Mauricio Pochettino's long-term plans is midfielder Paulinho . TOTTENHAM . Consistency has been an issue for Tottenham and some indifferent form led to questions about the manager. But Mauricio Pochettino is slowly shaping the team in his image. A top-four finish is the primary objective but squad additions are needed if that's to become a reality. BUDGET: £30m . TARGETS: NONE (but they like James McCarthy, Everton £25m; Danny Ings, Burnley £7m; Carlos Bacca, Sevilla £18m, Soimone Zaza, Sassuolo) WHO’S GOING OUT: Paulinho, Juventus, £8m; Younes Kaboul, possibly Besiktas, £5m; Aaron Lennon, possibly Stoke £7m; Kyle Naughton, possibly Swansea £4m, Emmanuel Adebayor, possibly Roma, £5m .","The January transfer window is currently open .

"Manchester United midfielder Darren Fletcher hopes the hard-fought 2-0 win over Yeovil will be a game to look back on if Louis van Gaal's side go on to win the FA Cup. A stunning finish from Ander Herrera helped United edge past a resolute Yeovil and into the fourth round.

'We knew it wasn't going to be easy,' Fletcher told BT Sport 1. 'It was going to be difficult with tackles flying in. You have to battle before you win the match and we did that today.

"You will often hear supporters chant the name of their club, their favourite player — but their favourite formation? That is exactly what you would have heard had you been at Loftus Road on Saturday. Frustrated Manchester United fans were screaming ‘4-4-2’ as they watched their side, who were playing a 3-5-2 formation, struggle to break down Queens Park Rangers. Louis van Gaal eventually altered his formation — and it worked a treat. Within minutes of switching to 4-4-2 Marouane Fellaini scored the opener in the 58th minute before fellow substitute James Wilson sealed victory in added time. So was United’s win down to their travelling support? Manager Van Gaal says not. Marouane Fellaini shoots to give Manchester United the lead against Queens Park Rangers at Loftus Road . Fellaini, pictured with Antonio Valencia, proved the catalyst for Man United's 2-0 win on Saturday afternoon . Fellaini ran towards the United bench before embracing team-mate Adnan Januzaj  after his goal . Frustrated Man United fans, pictured celebrating, were screaming ‘4-4-2’ during their side's initial struggles . This was only the second clean sheet for United in nine away games. The other came against Tottenham. ‘I have to look at the players and communicate with the players and observe the players,’ said the Dutchman. ‘I cannot observe the fans because how many fans do Manchester United have? ‘All over the world we’ve got 600 million. You cannot take into account 600 million opinions. ‘Before this match I had already thought about this shape. Then I look to my players in a training session and I look to my game plan and then I choose.’ United manager Louis van Gaal insists he can not observe opinions on formation from the club's fanbase . Radamel Falcao, back after being axed for last weekend’s home defeat by Southampton, had the chance to reassert himself in Van Gaal’s plans but it did not quite go according to plan. The Colombian missed a glut of glorious chances to prove himself, as Van Gaal had demanded. Nevertheless, the United boss said he was more than satisfied with the striker’s contribution. ‘I was very pleased,’ he said. ‘Every player gets his time, no matter who. We’ll wait and see. ‘The Falcao questions are not relevant. You can’t always give the credit to the most expensive player. Manchester United striker Falcao smashes a shot during Saturday's 2-0 victory over Queens Park Rangers . ‘If a young player never gets a chance I’m not a very good manager. I have to treat all players with the same rules and demands. ‘It’s difficult because the outside world is thinking when you pay a lot for the player you have to put him in the squad.’ Falcao said: ‘It was 90 very important minutes for me. I need to play and I am very happy that I did. Obviously, I really hope to score soon, but the opportunities will come. I am playing without any fitness problems.’ Manchester United have lost just once in 20 league games in London, winning 12 and drawing seven .","Manchester United defeated Queens Park Rangers on Saturday .

"FIFA presidential candidate David Ginola hopes to increase equality in football by staging the men's and women's World Cups at the same time. The Frenchman believes his idea will take the World Cup and women's football to 'new heights' as he looks to overthrow current FIFA chief Sepp Blatter, who is seeking a fifth term in office. With the tournaments both  taking place in different countries in different years, the 47-year-old wants to amalgamate the two for 'one global spectacular'. FIFA presidential candidate David Ginola is looking to combine the men's and women's World Cups . Despite Ginola's ideas for a reform Sepp Blatter is still odds-on favourite to secure a fifth election victory . 'We're talking about equality because we want women to be treated as well as the men,' Ginola told BBC Radio 5 live. 'We want the women's World Cup to be organised and played right after the men's World Cup. 'For example, it would have been in Brazil using the structure of the men's World Cup. It would be interesting to see how we can set this up.' As it stands, the 2015 Women's World Cup will be held in Canada on June 6, almost a full year after the men's tournament took place in Brazil last summer. Ginola's presidential bid has the backing of pressure group ChangeFIFA, which has long campaigned for new leadership at the top of an organisation that has faced numerous allegations of corruption. But the bid is also supported by bookmaker Paddy Power and has been dismissed as a publicity stunt in some quarters. 'This is something real and we will work hard for weeks and months,' Ginola said. 'We will be getting into details this week because we want to restore trust in FIFA. 'I am an independent voice and it's nice to have that different voice in the debate, to say that things can change and to leave a positive legacy behind.

"The Football Association has agreed to make its secret file on FIFA members compiled during England's failed 2018 World Cup bid available to MPs. Former sports minister Gerry Sutcliffe said the FA had agreed to make the file - which he believes was compiled with the help of the British intelligence services - available to be viewed by some members of the culture, media and sport select committee. The file is believed to have been compiled on the 24 members of the FIFA executive committee who voted on the 2018 and 2022 World Cups in December 2010. Former sports minister Gerry Sutcliffe said the FA will now publish its secret file on FIFA members . Sutcliffe, speaking in Brussels at the 'New FIFA Now' summit which is calling for reform of football's world governing body, said: 'Members of the committee are going to be allowed to see that file so we will see what was held at the time.' Sutcliffe said the FA had been reluctant to show the committee the file but had eventually agreed to let some members have access to it, though it will not be handed over. He said: 'I think part of this file was compiled using the intelligence services. 'The FA have been very cagey about it all. They were reluctant at first and said we could not see it, that it was restricted - clearly it's not. 'Public money was used on the bid from the bidding cities and the Government was asked to give guarantees, so we need to know about this. 'When I was sports minister I didn't know anything about this cloak and dagger stuff so we need to know why it happened, who raised it and what it was all about.' Lord Triesman (left) said last month the FA may have a secret dossier with potential evidence of corruption . Former FA and England 2018 chairman Lord Triesman said last month the FA 'apparently also have a secret dossier with potential evidence of corruption' which they had not made available to previous investigations into his allegations of corruption surrounding the World Cup bid. MP Damian Collins, the FIFA reform campaigner who organised the summit, told the meeting that the FA's previous willingness to co-operate had been 'a bit of a sham'.

"Former Tottenham Hotspur and France winger David Ginola has confirmed he intends to challenge Sepp Blatter for the FIFA presidency. But the 47-year-old’s bid to become the most powerful man in football could be over before it’s even started after questions were asked about the legitimacy of Ginola’s candidacy. His press conference on Friday morning was backed by bookmakers Paddy Power - known for long list of high-profile PR stunts, but not for major sports announcements - and he must meet strict FIFA regulations to run against Blatter.

"Former Tottenham star David Ginola is planning to challenge Sepp Blatter for the presidency of football's world governing body FIFA with a campaign launch planned for Friday in London. But whether the 47-year-old Frenchman has any realistic chance of getting the support he needs even to enter the race - let alone becoming the most powerful man in football - is in doubt. The seriousness of his bid is also sure to be called into question because his launch is being co-ordinated by bookmakers Paddy Power - famous for brilliant PR stunts to advertise their business but not associated with significant campaigns in sports politics. David Ginola is entering the race to become president of world football's governing body FIFA . Ginola is a regular contributor across a range of TV channels like BT Sport and the BBC . The M&C Saatchi PR company, acting on behalf of Paddy Power, has confirmed to The Associated Press that Ginola will launch his campaign in London on Friday. The hurdles Ginola would need to clear to get to the start line are formidable. By January 29 he needs to prove to FIFA that he has played an 'active role' in football for at least two of the last five years - a condition for candidates. Arguably more onerous is that he needs to show he has the support of five national associations from around the world. Ginola told The Sun: 'It is time that football was refreshed. 'I know it will not be easy for me to be elected but I have to try. Ginola played in the Premier League for Newcastle, Tottenham, Aston Villa and Everton before retiring in 2002 . The Frenchman has until January 29 to prove he has played an 'active role' in football in two of last five years .

'I'm not interested in dwelling on the sins of the past, this is about taking football forward and putting supporters at the centre of the game. 'Football belongs to the people and they deserve to have a voice. We want transparency so that everyone knows where every penny goes. People need to be able to trust the decisions being made by those in charge. 'I'm doing this because I believe I can make a difference. 'I'm always being asked questions about what is needed to change Fifa. Well now I'm going to do something about it.' Ginola is famous in England for his good looks and shampoo adverts as well as his sumptuous skills . Fellow Frenchman Jerome Champagne is also in the running for football's top job . FIFA vice-president Prince Ali Bin Al Hussein of Jordan has also declared an interest in the job . Incumbent Blatter, 78, has confirmed he will run and is the huge odds-on favourite to win. The election will take place in May at the FIFA Congress and three others have also declared an interest in the job — FIFA vice-president Prince Ali Bin Al Hussein of Jordan, former FIFA official Jerome Champagne and the former head of Chilean football, Harold Mayne-Nicholls. The first two have formally declared they will stand. Ginola, as famous in England for his good looks and shampoo adverts as for his sumptuous skills on the pitch, moved from Paris Saint-Germain to Newcastle in 1995. He later played for Tottenham, Aston Villa and Everton. He did the 'double' in the Player of the Year awards in 1999, winning both the PFA title awarded by his peers and the Football Writers' award from journalists - despite that being the season of Manchester United's Treble. Ginola is sure to receive wide support from many fans desperate for reform at FIFA - dogged by chronic corruption and serial controversie for years. But whether his attempt to become a serious power-broker will succeed is much less certain.","David Ginola set to announce at press conference on Friday that he is entering the race to become FIFA president .

"Italian businessman Massimo Cellino will seek to have his disqualification from owning Leeds United overturned at an appeal hearing on Thursday. Cellino was barred by the Football League's board from being owner and a director of Leeds in December after it ruled his conviction for tax evasion was a 'dishonest act'. Cellino's appeal will be heard by a three-person professional conduct committee, chaired by Tim Kerr QC. The outcome is likely to be known next week. Massimo Cellino will appeal against the Football League's decision to disqualify him from owning Leeds . If the Football League's disqualification is upheld, it will mean 58-year-old Cellino will have to step down as a director - but only until March, when his conviction becomes spent under UK law. Cellino was fined 600,000 euros (£465,000) by a court in Sardinia last March after being found guilty of failing to pay import duty on his yacht, the Nelie. Kerr was also the person who allowed Cellino's original appeal back in April on the basis that there were no written reasons available from the court case which would determine whether it was a dishonest act or not. Cellino was disqualified in December after he was convicted of tax evasion in Italy last year . However, the QC stated in his decision allowing that appeal: 'If the reasoned ruling of the court in Cagliari discloses the conduct of Mr Cellino was such it would reasonably be considered to be dishonest, he would be [disqualified].' The Football League then applied to the court in Cagliari for those written reasons, and once it had received them its board took the view that the conviction did constitute a dishonest act and announced he was to be disqualified. Cellino may try to claim that under Italian law he is still presumed innocent because the appeals process has not been exhausted. The issue with that, however, is it means he would then be gaining an advantage on any club director dealt with under British law where they are viewed as being guilty after the initial conviction. If upheld the disqualification will end in March because conviction becomes spent after one year under UK law . The Football League originally said Cellino had to resign as a director of Leeds by December 29 but agreed to defer that deadline until two days after the final decision by the professional conduct committee. A statement from the league last month said: 'As a consequence, the parties have agreed that if Mr Cellino is unsuccessful in his appeal, any disqualification period will be extended by an amount equivalent to the length of time between December 29 and the deferred deadline.' Cellino took over Leeds towards the end of last season and has already fired two managers - Dave Hockaday and Darko Milanic - during this campaign. Q: What is happening with Massimo Cellino? A: He is appealing against the Football League's board decision to disqualify him from being owner and a director of Leeds in December on the basis that his conviction in Italy for tax evasion was a 'dishonest act'. Q: What was his offence? A: An Italian court ruled he had deliberately evaded import tax on his yacht, the Nelie, when he brought it to Cagliari in Sardinia. Q: What will happen if he loses his appeal? A: He will have to resign as a director of Leeds and have no involvement in ownership or executive decisions. Q: How long will the disqualification last for? A: Only until March. Q: That does not seem to be long at all - why such a short time? A: The UK government changed the law last year so that anyone who was only fined for an offence would have their conviction regarded as being spent after only a year. Previously it had been five years before convictions became spent. Q: Who is hearing the appeal? A: The professional conduct committee - a three-strong panel chaired by Tim Kerr QC. Q: Anything interesting about Tim Kerr? A: He pronounces his surname 'car'. He has often sat as an arbiter on international and domestic sports disputes and disciplinary issues. According to his Chambers & Partners biography, he is a keen Chelsea fan and has run four marathons and speaks French, German and Spanish - but not Italian.","Massimo Cellino was barred from being owner and director in December .

"Cambridge United's prime-time date with Manchester United on BBC One has become more than an FA Cup fourth round tie. It has become a celebration of a club's survival and a display of appreciation for those who joined forces in the city to defy the odds and ensure their club did not wither and die when they were relegated from the Football League in 2005. There were dark times when it seemed like a tale destined to end in heartbreak but Cambridge pulled through, an inspiration for other small clubs on the slide and a testament to individuals who made it happen. Cambridge United chief executive Jez George, who spent time as manager of the club for a period . The Abbey Stadium, where Cambridge Untied will take on Manchester Untied in the FA Cup . There are many deserving credit, but they include Jez George, who is now the club's chief executive and has been many other things besides, both in an official and unofficial capacity. 'It's been a really tough period of time for the club,' said George. 'It was very hard for us to survive outside the Football League. The worst time for me was probably February 2011. The team was heading for relegation, there was no money, we had to move on some senior players and the manager was sacked. 'I was asked to take the team on as a caretaker manager until the end of the season. Fortunately, we'd fought really hard to set up a youth team in 2006 and a group of young players came through at the same time. 'Three of them played at Wembley last year – Josh Coulson, Liam Hughes and Luke Berry. They were thrown into the team and rescued the club really. Louis van Gaal and Radamel Falcao will travel to the Abbey Stadium on Saturday . The Cambridge players train ahead of their FA Cup clash with the Premier League giants . Cambridge manager Richard Money speaks to the press while sitting next to the FA Cup . 'We survived with a game to spare, but that was our darkest period. If the club had got relegated at that point it would have gone out of business. That was the lowest point. Cambridge stayed up and George, having taken over from Martin Ling, continued in charge as the gradual re-building process continued. He initially joined the club as a youth team coach and made a vital contribution to keeping the club's youth system going during the years with no funding, launching into a series of walks and marathons to raise thousands. For him the long road back was even more arduous. When Richard Money was appointed as manager in October 2012, George returned to the role of director of football. Last October, he became the chief executive. 'I never wanted to be a manager,' said 44-year-old George. 'But sometimes when it's your club there are a set of circumstances that make it the right thing to do. No-one else was here. The club had no money and were still paying off the contracts of the previous managers. Money issues instructions to his players during a training session . Former Manchester United man Luke Chadwick talks to the press about playing his former team . 'We were moving the senior players on and putting younger ones in, so it was only ever going to be me who was going to take responsibility for that. 'I had no real football background. I was a fan as a kid, and had worked as Cambridge City as commercial manager, where I set up a youth team. In 2005 they closed the youth scheme here at United so I was asked to come year a here later to set it up again. 'You have no funding outside the Football League, and no right for compensation if you lose players, no games programme, so to set something up from scratch when every single player had gone is very difficult. But this club was never going to have the finances to buy players so we knew we had to develop our own. And some of those players rescued the club in 2011. 'In the bleakest days the crowds were down to 1,600, and now they're back to 4,500 to 5,000. Getting back into the league has been a real catalyst for the club and the city, as we've all got something back we'd missed so badly. 'When you drop out of the Football League it feels as if you've fallen of the face of the earth. The Conference is a tough league, with good clubs in it. Stockport were relegated and are in Conference North. Hereford got relegated again and went out of business.' Cambridge, promoted to League Two via the Conference play-offs last year, are very much back in business. Bring on Manchester United.","Cambridge United face Manchester United in the FA Cup .

"Dick Pound, the hard-hitting former president of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA), is to head an independent commission investigating allegations of systematic doping and cover-ups in Russia. Pound will chair the three-man commission and will be joined by fellow Canadian Professor Richard McLaren, a longstanding member of the Court of Arbitration for Sport. It follows a programme broadcast by German TV station ARD on doping in Russia, which also alleged the IAAF world athletics body had failed to follow up on more than suspicious blood tests from more than 150 athletes including three from Britain. Dick Pound (above) will chair an independent three-man commission into alleged doping in Russia . WADA president Sir Craig Reedie said: 'WADA is pleased that Mr Richard Pound and Professor Richard McLaren have agreed to look into the grave doping allegations that came to light through the recent German television broadcasts. 'The independent commission has the vital task of reviewing the allegations aired during the documentaries, as well as all other information received separately by WADA, to determine if there have been any violations to anti-doping rules. 'Once the investigation is concluded, if it is found that there have been violations or breaches of the rules, WADA will ensure that any individuals or organisations concerned are dealt with in an appropriate fashion under the World Anti-Doping Code. Pound is the former president of the World Anti-Doping Agency . 'The commission will be given the resources it needs in order for the investigation to be carried out thoroughly, and so that, in turn, clean athletes across the world are reassured that the anti-doping system is working in their best interests.'

"IAAF vice-president Sebastian Coe says if the current doping allegations in athletics are true then it will be a scandal on a par with those which erupted around Ben Johnson and Marion Jones' positive drugs tests. An investigation is to begin into allegations of a cover-up of systematic doping in Russia, with a number of leading IAAF officials stepping down while that takes place. There are also claims that a list exists which names 150 athletes with suspicious blood results from 2006 to 2008, with three Britons - one high-profile - said to be on it. It is alleged the IAAF did not follow up those on the list. IAAF vice-president Sebastian Coe is deeply concerned with the current doping allegations in athletics . All the allegations have come from a series of programmes made by German television station ARD and if proven, they would have serious ramifications for the sport. 'How do I benchmark this? In the 40 or so years in athletics, there have been big moments. Ben Johnson in 1988, Marion Jones, this is up there and nobody is remotely suggesting these allegations are not serious,' Lord Coe said on BBC Radio Five Live's Sportsweek programme. Johnson failed a doping test after winning Olympic 100 metres gold in Seoul in 1988, while American Jones was stripped of five Olympic titles for doping breaches. When asked if this case could be of that magnitude, Coe added: 'If this is provable, of course it is.' Coe wants ARD, and its journalist Hajo Seppelt, to give him any more information there is, including the list of names which he has suggested may be far from official. Ben Johnson (second left) failed a doping test after winning Olympic 100 metres gold in Seoul in 1988 . 'It's been described as a bad week for athletics - I would go further, it's been a ghastly week. None of us should hide or shy away from that. We have to bring this tawdry, sorry episode and any of those allegations to a close as quickly as we can,' he said. 'I don't know about the existence of this list, it only got mentioned on German television. The simple answer is I don't know, the IAAF does not know what this list contains and whether it is a list that has any veracity at all. 'The offer we make as a federation is, if there is more information out there, if this German journalist feels there is a list, or whatever he's got, please let us know what it is. We need to bring this to a close as quickly as possible. That can be done by the IAAF's ethics committee, it can be done by WADA. We would go to Berlin and look at what he's got but we have to get as much information as we can on this. 'Nobody at the IAAF has seen a list.

"Manchester United might have splashed the cash on pedigree creative talents such as Angel Di Maria in the summer transfer window, but it was defender Phil Jones taking their corners at Loftus Road on Saturday. It was a bizarre move from Louis van Gaal during The Red Devils' 2-0 win that left plenty of fans scratching their heads.

"Like an old comedian reprising an ancient routine, Harry Redknapp turned in a bold and breezy post – match performance last night. His timing was slick, his patter engaging and his confident assertion that better times lie just ahead carried a degree of conviction. Then we remembered his team's performance, and we realised he was tap – dancing on a trap – door. For Rangers are every bit as poor as their League position suggests. Bereft of ideas, pace, intelligent cohesion and adequate ability, they fail just about every test which the top division imposes upon its members. A more confident, more ruthless side than the current United would have buried them beneath an avalanche of goals. But even this United were eventually able to impose themselves with the minimum of challenge. Redknapp's version of events was rather different, as you might expect. He was 'very pleased with the performance'. He insisted it was 'one of our better home performances'. He believes, mysteriously, that 'we're very difficult to play against'. And he is indignant about the newspaper story which started rumours concerning his imminent departure. 'I've spoken to the chairman five times this week, and he never mentioned it', he said.

Now I have no idea of what passed between manager and chairman, but the rest of his claims were patent tosh. The only surprise of the entire, dreary afternoon was that the last rites were delayed until the final few seconds, when the United substitute James Wilson was allowed to saunter through a broken defence and score at his second, leisurely attempt. Louis Van Gaal had justifications of his own to make, since even in victory United seemed but a shadow of the sides which once terrified England and most of Europe. 'We played in the first half the way QPR wanted us to play – through the air, long balls', he said. 'You have to play along the ground, despite the fact that the ground is not good here. He spoke of needing to 'stretch the pitch', to make better decisions. But his conclusion was beyond challenge: 'When you win', he said, 'everyone is happy'. Well, everyone bar the neutrals, who endured a parody of Premier League football for much of the match. The first half proceeded at pedestrian pace, with a sada absence of enterprise all round. Last week, QPR players were exchanging insults with their fans at Burnley, having lost their latest match on the road. Now they played like a side which was terrified of making an error. And United were almost equally inhibited, smothered by a tactical caution which seems alien to the spirit of the club.

They might have settled to their task early on when a series of attacks, instigated by Jonny Evans' driving run, culminated in a comfortable chance for Radamel Falcao. But the keeper was looming, the confidence was lacking and the shot was hastily ill – directed. As ever, Rangers looked desperately to Charlie Austin, and he did his best to answer the call half - way through the half, collecting a ball from deep and violently driving from 25 yards. David De Gea met it with a flying parry and a fist – clenching freprimand to his defenders. In truth, there was much to criticise. United are blessed with enormously expensive and extravagantly talented attackers, but they were constrained by the caution of their approach. 'Attack, attack, attack!', demanded the visiting fans. Then they pleaded for 4 – 4 – 2, as if the fault lay in the system rather than the approach. It was sadly undistinguished fare, which also became a trifle spiky, with the otherwise anonymous Joey Barton – who had earlier escaped unpunished for a palpable trip on Wayne Rooney off the ball and in the box – being booked for a studs – up challenge on Evans, and Juan Mata being punished for a clip of Barton's heels. At half time, Mata was replaced by Marouane Fellaini, and soon after Wilson came on for Evans, allowing United to revert to a back four rather than the formation despised by the fans. And by now United were finding the gaps which had eluded them. In 56 miniutes, Angel Di Maria's cross was met inside the six yard box by Falcao and provoked a fine save from Rob Green. Then two minutes later, the break through. Antonio Valencia sped down the right, released a low cross and Fellaini was given time and space to pick his spot and strike his scoring drive.

Adel Taarabt was brought on, a move of last resort from Redknapp. Then a wretched United misunderstanding on the half – way line allowed Eduardo Vargas a clear run on goal, which he let slip with his chronic indecision. Had things gone remotely right for Falcao, then the game would have been put to rest. But twice he came within inches of searching crosses, with the goal gaping an invitation. Later, the Rangers manager would detail some of his side's shortcomings, there being no time to go through the full list. But eventually he became almost philosophical about his personal future. 'I can only keep doing my best', he said. 'We've got as good a chance as anybody. What will be will be'. The routine was almost word – perfect. But the punch – line has yet to be delivered.

"Two of the sharpest dressers in football, Sky Sports’ new mega-signing, Thierry Henry, and the experienced Graeme Souness, were paired for the Frenchman’s much-anticipated Super Sunday debut. Nothing off the peg there, and after a fortnight of Henry’s arrival being heralded with a generous slab of on-screen fromage — and presenter Ed Chamberlin not looking too shabby either — they got down to business. An early, and legitimate, test of whether a great player turned pundit will deliver on air is when asked to reflect on the fortunes of his former club. Henry’s new team-mates, Gary Neville and Jamie Carragher, both passed that test with flying colours. Thierry Henry (centre) fared extremely well on his Sky Sports debut on Sunday afternoon . Henry, alongside the experienced Graeme Souness, looked dapper as he spoke about his old club Arsenal . So when Chamberlin chipped up a lunchtime tester on whether Arsenal have gone backwards in the past 12 months, it was significant that Henry didn’t duck. ‘Yes. It looks like a team that looks to finish fourth, which is not Arsenal. You want to win the title. They need to defend better, and not just the back four. It needs to be a team effort. They bought Mertesacker but does he have protection? ‘They are not far but they are missing a big piece... a Vieira and a Gilberto Silva.' Just to prove how well-settled he is as a pundit, Souness cutely offered: ‘Would you like your daughter to date any of the Arsenal players? They are a team of son-in-laws. All nice guys. You need a few rascals.’ Henry believes Arsenal lack a midfield player to protect the back four like former skipper Patrick Vieira . Henry also spoke highly of former team-mate Gilberto Silva on his Sky Sports punditry debut . Previewing the day’s hors d’ouevre, West Ham versus Hull City, Henry pinpointed the Hammers’ former Gunner Alex Song as a player ‘who would improve Arsenal’. Henry is understated but his studio work for the BBC in last summer’s World Cup showed he can deliver intelligent, incisive analysis. A goalless first half at Upton Park and Henry gave a view of life up front as he sees it. Hull’s Sone Aluko stays on his feet when challenged from behind by James Tomkins in the penalty area. ‘If you touch me I go down in the box… you stick your leg out like that from behind when you have been beaten you’re looking for trouble. It should have been a penalty, if he went down, which he didn’t.’ Jamie Carragher (left) and Gary Neville were quizzed on their old sides, just like Henry was on Sunday . Sky Sports presenter Ed Chamberlin (far right) was joined by Souness and Henry . In the build-up to the big game at the Etihad, Henry praised City’s David Silva and opined that Alexis Sanchez’s form for Arsenal stems from getting regular touches of the ball, unlike at Barcelona. As Arsenal gave an outstanding first-half display to lead through Santi Cazorla’s penalty, Henry pinpointed how the away side had neutralised Silva. ‘There is always a man between the ball and David Silva.’ His view on the penalty? ‘It was for me.’ And for Souness, too, to be fair. Arsenal completed a masterful 2-0 win and Henry’s focused on Arsenal’s tellingly different approach. ‘Usually Arsenal win games by passing and being brilliant with the ball. Not today. They defended well as a unit… 34% (possession) was enough to win.’ It was a match, Henry suggested, in which Arsenal showed ‘commitment, desire and togetherness’. Qualities that Sky Sports hope they will get in abundance from their new star signing. On this showing he looks tailor-made for the role.","Thierry Henry made his debut as a Sky Sports pundit on Sunday afternoon .

"Kevin Pietersen scored a blistering 67 not out from just 42 balls as he guided Melbourne Stars to a crushing eight-wicket victory over Sydney Thunder at the Spotless Stadium in the Big Bash League - before taking a veiled dig at former England ODI captain Alastair Cook. The former England batsman hit one six and 10 fours during his innings in Sydney on Saturday as the away side comfortably claimed victory with more than five overs still remaining, just fours after he was pictured on Bondi Beach sticking his middle finger up at photographers. The 34-year-old is now the No 1 runmaker in the Big Bash League this year with 281 runs from seven matches and calls will continue for him to return to the England side following another impressive display.

Pietersen, who gave the finger to a cameraman while he showed off his new tattoo - which displays the venues at which he scored each of his 31 international centuries - when walking along Bondi Beach before the game on Saturday, said: 'I think I'm batting better than I've ever batted.

One failure does not make them bad.' Cook played in the England line-up in Sri Lanka but was subsequently sacked as ODI captain and Pietersen took a veiled dig at his former international team-mate. Pietersen insisted he will now watch the England line-up - but the side in Sri Lanka, which contained Cook, would not have interested him. He added: 'It's (the current England line-up) is one that I'll watch. 'I might not have watched the one in Sri Lanka but I'll watch this one. 'I don't think I made it look easy (out at the crease) but I think the wicket got easier as the nightfall came. Pietersen steps forward and smashes the ball for one of his 11 boundaries on Saturday in Sydney . Pietersen (right) talks to fellow Stars batsman Cameron White during the victory on Saturday . 'I think we got the good rub of the green. We won the toss and put them in - I think our bowlers deserve credit. I got runs but they deserve credit.'

"David Warner was at the centre of an unsavoury incident during Australia's one-day international against India in Melbourne - and fined 50 per cent of his match fee. The 28-year-old Australian clashed with Rohit Sharma during the match at the Melbourne Cricket Ground and the pair needed to be separated by umpires and other players. The heated verbal exchange could not be heard on the television feed, but Warner appeared to repeatedly mouth the words 'speak English' towards the Indian batsman. David Warner and Rohit Sharma exchange words during Australia's clash with India in Melbourne . Warner was unhappy after India took a single when when he felt the ball deflected off Sharma's pads . Warner said on Sky Sports Radio: 'We play hard aggressive cricket but we know what comes with it, sometimes you are going to get fined. 'We've just got to keep trying not to cross that line, because we're all about playing cricket the right way. 'When I went over to say something to him, he sort of said something in their language and I said ""speak English"" because, if you're going to say something, understand that theoretically I cannot speak Hindi,"". 'I did the polite thing and asked him to speak English, therefore he did and I can't repeat what he said. 'I was in the wrong ... I shouldn't have engaged him.' The clash comes off the back of a four-match Test series between the teams that was filled with tension and bad blood. The conflict came at the end of the 23rd over of India's innings after Sharma hit a delivery from James Faulkner to Warner at mid-off. Sharma and Suresh Raina refused a single as Warner fielded the ball and threw to the wicketkeeper’s end. Warner’s throw went through Sharma's leg with the Indian batsman's back turned and Australian wicketkeeper Brad Haddin then missed the ball. Sharma and Warner were separated by the umpires after tempers flared between the pair . Sharma and Raina then scampered through for an overthrow, much to the frustration of the home side. Australia thought the ball deflected off Sharma's pads and felt the Indian pair should not have taken an extra run. Warner walked up the wicket to confront Sharma, by which stage Glenn Maxwell was already raising the issue with the Indian batsman.

"It was a sight that must rank among the more unlikely in cricket history. There was Andrew Flintoff trotting out at the Gabba to join the England team for the first time since limping into Ashes immortality at the Oval almost six years ago. Back then any thoughts of a comeback, let alone an appearance in an England shirt, were outlandish for an iconic figure whose body gave up on him during that 2009 summer when he left the field for the final time as an Ashes winner. Yet there he was on Sunday, larger than life, back training among a new generation of England players, many of whom would have grown up watching him at his peak when the fabled 2005 Ashes gripped the nation. Former England cricketer Andrew Flintoff bowls during a nets session at The Gabba . Flintoff chats to bowler James Anderson during their training session at The Gabba . It will not lead to a playing return for his country, of course, and Flintoff restricted himself to barely half an hour’s bowling at just Chris Jordan and Chris Woakes during his day back with the England team at Peter Moores invitation. But if this is to be the end of Flintoff’s sojourn back into the game – and he has hinted that he may not return to Lancashire this summer after finishing his Big Bash stint with Brisbane – then it was not the worst way to bow out. England intended Flintoff’s day among them to be a low-key affair and the first of a number of visits from past greats aimed, as is the wont of Australia under Darren Lehmann, at encouraging a bit of star dust to rub off on the team. But such is the enduring appeal of the man known as Freddie that all eyes were on him as he donned mitts to assist with a boxing training exercise and then took up his position at the back of the nets, passing on advice to England’s bowlers. ‘I’m just here as a net bowler,’ said Flintoff, as he declined an invitation to talk about how he came to be back in England’s colours and it was left to Moores, who worked with Freddie during his first stint as England coach, to explain. ‘It’s nice to get players who have been brilliant with England back among the squad,’ said Moores. ‘The game has moved on but it has also stayed the same in many ways and it was just great to have Freddie around. Flintoff holds pads as Jos Buttler of England boxes in preparation for their nets session . Flintoff has joined the camp to pass on his experience to the younger members of the England team . James Taylor takes a turn on the pads with Flintoff before their session in the nets . Flintoff appeared to enjoy his time back training with the England squad . ‘This squad are very keen to connect with some of those who have been there and done it with England because it can only help them.’ Flintoff restricted himself to chatting with the likes of Jordan and bowling coach David Saker at first during net practice while Jimmy Anderson went through an extended bowling session that appeared to confirm his fitness for Tuesday’s tri-series match here against India. But the man who has made only a modest impact with a Brisbane Heat team who have now been knocked out of this year’s Big Bash could not resist a bit of a trundle after passing on some advice to Steven Finn, who looked a detached figure and seems sure to be the bowler to miss out when Anderson returns. Flintoff beat the edge of Jordan’s bat a couple of times and was also respected by Woakes when he had a net before an extended England training session came to an end in Brisbane’s sweltering heat. He joined the team at a barbeque here last night before rejoining his family on the Gold Coast where Flintoff has based himself while making a very positive impression – perhaps more off-field than on it – on the Big Bash. The England players seemed to enjoy having Flintoff among them and Freddie certainly seemed to enjoy it himself. It was certainly nice for all concerned while it lasted.

"The way Steve Cotterill planned it, by this time he’d have been managing against Premier League teams every week. Instead he leads League One Bristol City into Sunday’s live TV fourth-round FA Cup tie against West Ham rather glad to remind everybody he’s still around, and still producing teams that can win games. It was nearly 13 years ago that Cotterill  was the rising star of management. He’d taken his home town club Cheltenham from the Southern League to what is now League One, before moving to his first big club job at Stoke. Bristol City manager Steve Cotterill is preparing for the visit of West Ham in the FA Cup on Sunday . Just five months and 13 games later he walked out and went to work with Howard Wilkinson at Sunderland — and it’s been a topsy-turvy ride ever since. ‘I was impatient, I wanted to get to the top and I made bad decisions because of it,’ said Cotterill, 50. ‘But nobody quite knows the real reasons I walked away from Stoke. I didn’t have Peter Coates and Phil Rawlins running the club, I had the Icelandic owners. Even Tony Pulis left them. ‘I left after five months, but I should have left Stoke after five days. Then more people would have asked why.’ A younger Cotterill on the touchline as Stoke City manager in September 2002 . Cotterill celebrating leading Cheltenham to victory in the Division Three playoff final  in 2002 . The promise of following Wilkinson into the top job at Sunderland was never kept, and he ended up in charge of Burnley struggling in the Championship. ‘We had nothing but I made about 16million quid through cup runs and selling players. Then I couldn’t get 300 grand one day and I spat my dummy and left. Impatience again.’ From there it was Notts County, Portsmouth, Nottingham Forest and then Bristol City. So has he found the club to get back to the big time? ‘The chairman has put £50m into the team, and is putting in another £40m to rebuild the stadium. ‘Bristol definitely could host a Premier League club — about 550,000 people live here.

"Martin Canning is glad he no longer has to keep his appointment as Hamilton player/manager a secret. At a press conference on Friday at New Douglas Park to confirm the 33-year-old defender in his new post, it was revealed he had known about his promotion since Alex Neil's departure to Norwich on January 9. While the waters were muddied by Accies putting a deadline on applications for the post, Canning, in caretaker charge for three consecutive defeats, had to straight-bat questions about his position until the board had assembled together a new management structure. Hamilton are set to announce caretaker boss Martin Canning as their new manager on Friday . Former Hamilton player Chris Swailes, latterly working at Newcastle United's academy, has been appointed assistant manager while another former Accies player, Guillaume Beuzelin, comes in as head coach after leaving his assistant's post at Dumbarton, a role which involves also overseeing the youth set-up. After a 'turbulent' time Canning was happy to be able to talk freely about his new job. He said: 'It is not something you want to keep to yourself but it had to be until the directors had everything in place. 'It is never easy and not something you like to do on a regular basis but if it is for the greater good and the right purpose, sometimes it has to be done . 'It was about trying got keep things as normal as possible in the changing room and the pitch although results have not been what we wanted. Defender Canning has been in caretaker charge for three consecutive defeats since Alex Neil left for Norwich . 'Behind the scenes it was in my thoughts. 'But it wasn't something I wanted to discuss, it wasn't the time to discuss it. 'I was delighted to get the opportunity and delighted the board have got the right people behind me.' Another former Hamilton player, Brian Potter, comes in as goalkeeping coach from Dunfermline while winger Dougie Imrie takes over the Under-17 side. Swailes and Beuzelin will take the training which Canning believes will help with his desire to keep on playing. The former Hibernian stopper said: 'It is a great opportunity for me to go into management while marrying it with playing. 'A lot of player/managers play less or stop playing so that tells you that it is not an easy thing to do. Neil was their 31-year-old captain when he replaced Billy Reid following a seven-year reign . 'But I feel as if I still have something to offer and as long as I think that I will continue to play. 'That's why it is important to have a good backroom team to take as much of that strain off as possible.' It was a busy day at the Lanarkshire club. Vice chairman Ronnie MacDonald revealed that he had turned down a bid of around £300,000 from Polish club Jagiellonia Bialystok for 21-year-old defender Ziggy Gordon and that two top-flight English clubs have expressed an interest in 20-year-old left-back Stephen Hendrie, whose proposed move to West Ham had fallen through. Chairman Les Gray also confirmed that defender Michael Devlin, 21, had agreed a three-year extension to his contract. MacDonald, who also revealed that interest in midfielder Tony Andreu from a Chinese club had failed to materialise, said: 'The night we knew Alex was going was the night we told Martin he was the new manager. 'We didn't ask for applications but we received more than 60. We interviewed no one but we thank them all. 'We took the opportunity to re-organise the club. We take the long view, we want to do what's right.'","Hamilton manager Alex Neil left for Norwich City earlier this month .

"Dani Vallverdu has played down talk of a rift with Andy Murray insisting the end of their working partnership was 'genuinely mutual'. Murray made a host of changes to his group last season, hiring Amelie Mauresmo as coach to replace Ivan Lendl who left his post in March and then stopping working with long-time friend Vallverdu and fitness trainer Jez Green. The exit of Vallverdu raised some eyebrows as the pair met at the Sanchez-Casal Academy in Spain more than a decade ago and the Venezuelan held an increasingly important role in the coaching team under Lendl. Dani Vallverdu has denied a rift with Andy Murray and insists their working relationship was ended mutually . Andy Murray in action against Portugal's Joao Sousa on Day Five of the Australian Open at Melbourne Park . In an interview with The Independent earlier this month, Murray appeared to suggest that the relationship had become strained, saying: 'The most important point in any team is that everyone has the same vision, everyone wants to move forward together. Maybe the last four or five months of last year it wasn't like that.' But Vallverdu, who is now coaching Tomas Berdych, insists that was not the case and that the relationship had simply run its course. 'We were all pulling in the same direction,' he told the Daily Mail. 'I'm quite proud of how we pulled it around after the US Open. It was pretty hard, him qualifying for (the ATP Tour Finals in) London from his position after New York. 'Of course Andy is the one who played the matches but everyone had the goal of helping him get there. I don't think the last four months are a reason we aren't working together any more, it was genuinely mutual. 'His determination, professionalism and stubbornness, that's what has made him so successful but, because of the way he is, it gets to the point when it is time for both parties to go their own ways.' He added: 'Andy and I have been friends for nearly 15 years. Our personal relationship is still good, I consider him one of my best friends and I'll always be in his corner, except for when I am coaching against him.'

"QPR boss Harry Redknapp defended his decision not to include Adel Taarabt in his starting line-up against Manchester United, as the R's fell to a second successive Premier League defeat on Saturday. The 67-year-old, who had an extraordinary bust-up with the Moroccan earlier in the season, brought Taarabt in from the cold to start him in last Saturday's defeat at Burnley – with the 25-year-old putting in an assured display. Despite that, Redknapp opted not to use him from the off against Louis van Gaal's side this time around, believing it to be too big a risk to change a system that has worked so effectively for Rangers at Loftus Road this term. Adel Taarabt was left out of QPR's starting line-up against Manchester United, despite impressing at Burnley . Harry Redknapp has defended the decision to bench the playmaker from Morocco .

On whether he felt he made a mistake not starting Taarabt, Redknapp replied: 'I didn't think it was right to change a system which has worked so well for us at home this season. 'Our home form has been great and its been because we've played a certain way, and Bobby Zamora and Charlie Austin have been pivotal to that. 'He (Taarabt) did some bits and pieces and showed some good skill when he came on though.

He added: 'I felt it was one of our better performances at home this season – we were a threat to them for sure.

"Laying the ground for a return to management, Derek Adams is keen to debunk some popular misconceptions. The first is that he could start a fight in an empty room. The second that he and his father George are bound together by an umbilical cord. In seven years at Ross County — with a brief spell at Hibernian thrown in — Adams punched above his weight. Sometimes literally. Laying the ground for a return to management, Derek Adams is keen to debunk some misconceptions . His departure, a mere four games into the season, owed more to a fraught relationship with chairman Roy MacGregor than any concerns over his managerial ability. There were other minor spats as well; with Danny Lennon, Allan Johnston and Jamie Hamill. And, of course, with Terry Butcher. Especially Terry Butcher. Sipping cappuccino in a coffee shop in Glasgow’s Merchant City, Adams chuckles over the memories of a very contrived Highland rivalry. ‘I miss being on the touchline,’ he admits. ‘I miss the pressure of going into a game. ‘Even the confrontations. I quite enjoyed that aspect of it all. ‘Big Terry and I were arch rivals at County and Inverness, but the truth is that we actually got on very well. ‘We fought our corner for our football clubs, sure. But it gave everybody a wee bit of interest in the Highlands. It gave it all a wee bit of razzmatazz and edge. ‘We had a go at each other in derby games. But look at the crowds since we left those clubs. They have dwindled. We made that game an occasion.’ There was an infamous stand-off in March 2013. A goalless draw was enlivened by a touchline confrontation which, played out in Glasgow, would have finished in a Scottish government summit. Even now, images on You Tube suggest the pair could hardly stand each other. Adams played down his rivalry with Terry Butcher, insisting the pair were actually good friends . ‘That’s how we tried to portray it,’ chuckles Adams. ‘It was good for business. ‘We stoked up an atmosphere, a bit of aggro. ‘People thought we didn’t like each other. That we didn’t like each other’s clubs. That it could all go off at any time. And because of that people came through the gates.’ If it was an act it was convincing. An Oscar challenger to Charles Green for best performance in a Scottish drama. ‘Oh, we were good,’ grins Adams. ‘But go back to what (renowned sports impresario) Barry Hearn said a few weeks ago about Scottish football. ‘There is not enough showmanship. Not enough razzmatazz or whatever you want to call it. We have to sell the game and Terry and I did that. ‘What’s the point of a club in the highlands having a dull manager? ‘There are plenty of them in football. People who only have someone else’s opinions. ‘I tried to be different. I had an opinion and I gave it. I thought to myself: “Not everyone is going to like this”. ‘I knew other clubs wouldn’t especially like what I was saying about them. ‘This wee upstart from Ross County thinks because he beat Celtic and Aberdeen and Dundee United he can say what he likes? They thought we should know our place. But Terry and I never accepted that. Adams watches a Ross County training session with his father, Geroge . ‘The reality is that I spoke to Terry just a couple of weeks ago. Terry has even helped me with some bits of my CV, for goodness sake.’ Even so, reputations linger. Chairmen speak. Opposition supporters, too, have formed a view of Adams as a nippy sweetie quite at odds with the intelligent, thoughtful man behind the panto persona. ‘I’m probably a lot different on the pitch from how I am off it,’ he ponders. ‘When it comes to Saturday afternoon that’s when it all comes. ‘But you can say a lot of successful managers are a bit hot to handle.’ Famously, Adams refuses to swear or drink. In the civilised world this is normal behaviour. In Scottish football it confuses people. ‘I have always been that way,’ he says. ‘I can shout and bawl with the best of people, but I just don’t feel I need to swear. ‘I never drank — it’s the way I am. It’s just me as a person. ‘I don’t feel the need to apologise for it. People probably think if you don’t swear and drink you’re a bit different here. But I do make up for it in terms of anger, I suppose.’ There was anger over the way his departure from Ross County happened. It was barely the end of September when, following months of tension over the direction the club was taking, Adams was fired. Uniquely, the news came in a phonecall from his own father George, the director of football. ‘The chairman never actually spoke to me personally. He never phoned me,’ says Derek. Then-Ross County manager Adams celebrates after winning the Scottish Cup semi final at Hampden Park . ‘I had to phone him to hear I had been sacked. For the service I had given the club over seven years I felt I deserved better than that. ‘My dad phoned me to say: “Listen, I’ve had a meeting with the chairman. We’re sacked and you have to phone him”.’ ‘I phoned him and he said: “You’ll have heard the news”. We had a two-minute conversation and that was it.’ Managers are sacked from football clubs every day. Few hear the news from their own dad. At County, Derek and George worked closely together. Yet after five months out of work the younger Adams dismisses the notion that they come as a package. That any club hiring Derek gets George as well. ‘There’s no doubt that in Scottish football that’s what many people think,’ he concedes. ‘That’s simply not the case and never will be. ‘Dad accepts that. He knows that. ‘We did a fantastic job at Ross County but we have to move on. He will take his path and I will take mine. ‘Listen, I was always my own man. I picked the team, I decided which players came in. ‘I never used to tell my dad the team because it was none of his business. Adams revealed that Real Sociedad David Moyes gave him advice on how to deal with being out of a job . ‘Working with your father is good and bad. It could be very intense at times. ‘We had spells where we had fall-outs on a weekly basis. ‘The second time round at Ross County there were no more than a handful. ‘When your father is the director of football you speak to him in a way you might not speak to someone else. ‘There were things I wouldn’t share with him in a football sense simply because I wanted to try them my own way. Now I am ready to do that on a more permanent basis.’ Based on his record at County — he took an unfashionable club from the Scottish highlands into the top six of the Premiership and to a Scottish Cup final — Adams should be fending off suitors. Yet, since ruling himself out of the running for Motherwell, the phone has hardly rung off the hook. St Mirren or Rangers could do worse but, so far, have yet to make a call. Others in the game have been more communicative. ‘I went to Spain last week and took in the Malaga against Villareal game,’ he adds. ‘I then went up to Granada to take in their game with Real Sociedad and Davie Moyes very kindly agreed to meet me after the game for half an hour. ‘I went down to the changing room and spoke to him, to get a wee bit of advice and his take on how you deal with being out of the game. Adams managed Ross County for six years over two different spells, first 2007-10, then 2011-14 . ‘For him to take the time to speak and understand where I am and try to help was hugely appreciated. He had all that success at Everton and was really badly treated at Man United and didn’t get the time to move on. ‘He said to me: “Get around clubs, speak to people, watch teams training and their methods”.’ ‘So after that I went down to Marbella and I watched Dynamo Kiev, Mainz and Freiburg training. Basle were there as well. ‘By coincidence so was Archie Knox. He was staying in my hotel having lunch with friends when I walked in. ‘He said to me: “Any chance of me coming along to training with you?”. I was glad of the company and ended up taking him to training sessions and games. ‘I picked his brain as well. How can you not? It’s great to learn from the older generation and taking advice from people who have been there.’ He plays some golf and has dabbled in the media. But, at 39, Adams knows he can’t pick or choose his next gig. He doesn’t have the luxury. ‘If you have the hunger and desire — and I do — you hope people will recognise that. I’ve had plenty of leisure time. It’s time to get back to work.’","Derek Adams has been out of a job since leaving Ross County .

"Faced with an opponent nicknamed 'Mad Dog', Andy Murray might have been expecting quite a fight in his second round at the Australian Open. Instead, Marinko Matosevic fairly ushered him into the last 32 this morning, going down 6-1, 6-3, 6-2 with a slew of unforced errors, detaining him for just 102 minutes. It was a highly satisfactory bit of work for Murray, who enjoyed the precious economy of getting things over and done with quickly on what was the first day of sapping temperatures at Melbourne Park. Andy Murray looks to the skies as he books his place in the last 32 of the Australian Open . Murray signs autographs for fans after his win over Marinko Matosevic . Murray looked in complete control as he beat  Matosevic in straight sets . Murray won the first set in just 21 minutes and dropped just one point on his serve . Matosevic struggled to get into the game and was no real test for the No 6 seed . Murray will now face world number 55 Joao Sousa, who went through when his opponent Martin Klizan retired through injury in the fourth set of their match. The 27 year-old Scot is now 10-0 versus Australians in his career, and the contest against Matosevic went to type. Asked if he did not like Australians he replied, 'I love Aussies, I had no idea about that. With the young players coming through here I'm not sure how long I'll keep that record up. Murray dropped just six games on his way to the third round . Kim Sears was in the box on the Margaret Court Arena as she watched Murray ease to victory . 'I started extremely well today, he improved as the match went on and there were some closer games in the second and third sets that could have gone either way. I really enjoyed it even if not everyone was supporting me. 'It was nice to finish and not to be out here for too long.' Returning to the secondary Margaret Court Arena, Murray was far too solid against the world number 81, who has destructive power while also having the ability to self-destruct. This was not one for the body language purists as Matosevic continually waved his arms around in frustration while the world number six also got irritated with himself at times, despite being in control from the off. The first set took just 21 minutes as his opponent contributed 16 unforced errors. There was a small blight on Murray in him dropping serve once in the second as Matosevic lifted his level, but there were never any serious alarms. By the end Matosevic had run up 49 unforced errors, but that should not detract from the professional performance of Murray in one of his matches that will only linger very briefly in the memory. He is easing himself towards tougher tasks ahead, although Sousa should not prove too scary a prospect. Murray barely had to break sweat on the hottest day of the Australian Open so far . Murray looked very comfortable as he booked his place in the last 32 in Melbourne . Murray's fans make themselves heard despite most of the spectators getting behind Matosevic . Murray denied later that he brought any extra determination to the match after Matosevic’s comments last summer that he did not think it a good idea hiring a female coach like Amelie Mauresmo: 'No. I get on well with Marinko,' he said. 'I spoke to him a little bit about what he said. He didn't mean any harm. Everyone's entitled to their opinion on anything. If he wants to get coached by a man, that's absolutely fine. 'I have absolutely no issue with it at all. I still think he's a good guy. I wasn't trying to prove a point at all when I was playing Marinko today. I was trying to win the match.' Occasionally Murray can be a slow starter, so he was delighted today about the way he fairly sprinted to the first set: 'I definitely started quite quickly today. I was timing the ball well on the return and serving well from the beginning of the match, and it helped a lot because obviously the crowd were behind him. I managed to take the crowd out of it a little bit by starting that quickly.'","Andy Murray beat Marinko Matosevic 6-1, 6-3, 6-2 .

In fact, the Stallions could easily have scored three or four in an open first half. Burkina Faso: Sanou; Koffi, Yago, Kone (Nakoulma 77), Bambara; Djakaridja , Kabore,; Zongo (Bance), A. Traore, B. Traore; Pitroipa . Gabon: Ovono; Palun, Masavu-King, Ecuele Manga, Obiang; Ndong (Kaku 63 mins), Poko, Madinda (Mbingui 83); Bulot, Evouna (Boukamba 87), Aubameyang . Booked: Ndong 40, Bulot 53 . Goals: Aubameyang 19, Evouna 72 . Bertrand Traore, the Vitesse winger on loan from Chelsea, was the beneficiary of a defensive mix-up, but his stinging volley was palmed away by Gabon stopper Didier Ovono. Alain Traore was the next to be denied, a last-ditch block preventing him from getting a shot away when well-placed inside the penalty area. The pace of Jonahan Pitroipa was a constant threat in behind, and in the 19th minute he escaped the Gabonese defence and skipped around Ovono, but, having been forced wide, was unable to find a team-mate. Just seconds later, Burkino Faso’s wastefulness was punished. Levy Madinda slid a lovely ball down the right hand channel for Gabon’s Borussia Dortmund star Aubameyang, who gave Pitroipa a lesson in staying calm in front of goal. Gabon's Malick Evouma (centre) rises the highest to head in his side's second goal of the game . Although Aubameyang’s first shot was saved, he took his time with the rebound, commiting the covering defenders before firing into the roof of the net for his sixth goal in his last four games for Gabon. Pitroipa, the leading goalscorer in all Cup of Nations qualifying, continued to have chances, but just couldn’t show the same finishing touch as Aubameyang. On the half-hour mark Jonathan Zongo got free down the left hand side and fed the ball across to his striker, unmarked on the edge of the box. But Pitroipa could only fire straight at the keeper. Again, he was very nearly punished immediately. Moments later Ibrahim Ndong latched on to an over-hit cut-back and fired just wide with the keeper well beaten. Burkina Faso continued to create chances, and yet another glorious one fell to Pitroipa, when Alain Traore’s scuffed shot fell to him five yards out. Again, however, the Al Jazira striker was denied by Ovono. Gabon's Didier Ibrahim Ndong (centre) defends against Burkina Faso's Jonathan Zongo (right) The second period started slowly, but both Bulot and Bertrand Traore had good chances, the former volleying straight at the keeper when well placed, and the latter seeing a cheeky attempt to squeeze the ball in at the near post kicked away, following a strong run from the left. Aubameyang could have added a second in the 68th minute, but after being played in down the left hand channel by Evouna, the Gabon captain curled his shot just wide. It didn’t matter though, because just four minutes later Charlton winger Bulot showed quick feet down on the right wing, beating his man and sending in an inviting cross for Evouna to head home. Bulot forced Germain Sanou into a good save in stoppage time, as Gabon saw out the remainder in relative comfort.","Gabon get off to strong start in AFCON 2015 with win against Burkina Faso .

"Australia captain Mile Jedinak has returned from injury to lead a revamped Socceroos team in Thursday's Asian Cup quarter-final against China at Brisbane's Lang Park. Jedinak missed Australia's last two group matches after injuring his ankle in the opening match of the tournament but was passed fit to rejoin his side for the knockout phase. The inclusion of Jedinak was one of the seven changes Australia coach Ange Postecoglou made to the team that started in Saturday's 1-0 loss to South Korea.

With centre back Matthew Spiranovic suspended for the match after picking up two yellow cards in the group phase, Postecoglou tightened up the defence by recalling Jason Davidson and Trent Sainsbury. He also brought back his three key attackers, Tim Cahill, Robbie Kruse and Matthew Leckie, after they all started on the bench for the last game and named midfielder Marco Bresciano in the run-on side for the first time at the tournament. 'We'll be ready for anything; normal time, extra-time or penalties or whatever it is,' Postecoglou said. Ange Postecoglou, Australia coach, has made seven changes to his starting line-up for the quarter-final . Tim Cahill was rested for the final group game against South Korea but has now returned to the starting XI . 'There's a game of football to be won and that will be our objective.' China coach Alain Perrin made four changes to his team that started in Sunday's 2-1 win over North Korea. Defender Ren Hang was recalled after sitting out the last match because of suspension while striker Wu Lei was brought back to lead the attack. Wu Xi and Ji Xiang were also recalled to the midfield. 'I've been very satisfied with our performances. We won all three games and we deserved the results. If we keep it up I think we will do well,' Perrin said. 'They (Australia) are at home and have quality players like Cahill who are tough and have technical ability. But if our players play with the spirit they have had so far, I think we're in for a very good result.'","Mile Jedinak has missed Australia's last two group matches .

"Arsene Wenger believes Francis Coquelin can be a long-term solution to Arsenal's midfield conundrum after offering the 23-year-old is offered a new contract at the Emirates. Just over a month ago, the French central midfielder lined up for Championship side Charlton as they travelled to Nottingham Forest for a mid-table clash. Step forward to mid-January and Coquelin was a major force in Arsenal's win over Manchester City at the Etihad; a potentially title-defining moment in the Premier League. Francis Coquelin celebrates Arsenal's victory over Manchester City after he played a major part . In December, Coquelin was on loan at Championship side Charlton but was recalled after injuries at Arsenal . Speaking ahead of Sunday's FA Cup clash with Brighton, Wenger admitted that Coquelin has shown significant developments in the last year. 'I saw that he made huge improvements in training and I explained to him that for me to give him a potential chance, he needed match practice,' Wenger said. 'I could not give him that, I could give him that only if he had played somewhere else before. He took the challenge, he came back and since I have played him he is doing well.' Coquelin (second right, pictured against Manchester City) has played every Arsenal game since December 13 . Arsene Wenger has revealed that he feels Coquelin could be the long-term solution to his midfield conundrum . Arsenal have struggled with injury in their midfield this season; Mesut Ozil, Jack Wilshere, Aaron Ramsey, Mikel Arteta and Abou Diaby have all been sidelined, leading to Wenger invoking an emergency recall of Coquelin to bring him back in December. Wenger admits that he could well be a long-term solution to a problem Arsenal are looking to solve soon. 'Yes, of course. He is a very young player. You look just at what happens on the pitch. Win the ball and make a good pass. In his position that is important,' said Wenger. To ensure that the Emirates is his home for the foreseeable future, Arsenal have offered the Frenchman a longer contract. His current deal expires at the end of this season but the Arsenal boss is confident of tying up new terms in the near future. 'Yes, we have offered him a new deal,' Wenger confirmed. 'I am confident that it will be done.' Wenger has offered Coquelin a new contract to keep him at the Emirates longer than this season .

"Sam Vokes has told Sean Dyche he is ready to play a full part in Burnley's fight for Premier League survival as soon as the Clarets boss needs him. The striker's 20 goals were crucial in Burnley's unexpected promotion from the Championship last season but he missed the final few weeks after damaging cruciate knee ligaments in March. Vokes finally made his comeback as a late substitute in Burnley's 1-0 loss to Liverpool on Boxing Day, earning a rousing reception both when his name was read out before the game and when he came on. Sam Vokes made his return from injury as a second-half substitute against Liverpool on Boxing Day . The 25-year-old has shown in the development games he played in to build up his fitness that he has not lost his eye for goal and, with Burnley having scored only 12 goals in 18 Premier League matches, there is no doubt he has been missed. Dyche does not feel he is quite ready to start yet and he will almost certainly be among the substitutes again when the Clarets visit Manchester City on Sunday. Vokes said: 'It was great to be back. It was obviously a tough one to take with the result, going on how we played, but on a personal note it's nice to be back out on the pitch. 'I've been itching to get back. It's been a long-term plan and it's coming together nicely. I got told to aim for the new year so nine months ago I'd probably have taken this. Vokes celebrates on the pitch while on crutches last season after injuring his cruciate knee ligaments in March . 'I've got three or four 90 minutes under my belt now in the reserves and that's a big thing for me. Whenever the gaffer calls upon me, I'm ready.' The Wales international accepts, though, that he may have to bide his time even when Dyche does deem him ready. Ashley Barnes has established himself as Danny Ings' strike partner and scored winning goals against Hull and Southampton while Lukas Jutkiewicz and Marvin Sordell are also on the books. 'There's a lot of competition and that's only good for the club,' said Vokes. 'Barnesy came in and has done fantastically, got a couple of great goals, and match-winning goals as well. It's important we keep that competition and everyone fighting for a place.' Vokes scored 20 goals in the Championship last season before his injury as Burnley earned promotion . Vokes and Ings were the most effective forward pairing in the Championship last season and Ings has already shown he can be a big danger at Premier League level. 'I'm not surprised at all,' said Vokes. 'We all saw it last year and over the last few years. He's kicked on another level this year. It's good to get back alongside him.' The Liverpool defeat saw Burnley drop to 19th in the table but there was plenty of room for optimism after a first-half performance Dyche rated as the best of his time at the club. Ings hit the post and Burnley dominated possession and chances only to be caught out by a Raheem Sterling break in the 62nd minute. Danny Ings hit the post with this strike during the defeat by Liverpool on Boxing Day . Vokes has seen his team-mates grow into the challenge after a difficult start but knows good performances are not enough. He said: 'The lads have definitely come on. The first 10 games was obviously getting used to it but we definitely look like we deserve to be here now. We're not getting turned over in games. 'It was always going to be tough but, if we look at performances like (Liverpool), we came up against a strong Liverpool side and held our own for most of the game. It's just important that we come out of games like this with points now.' The challenges do not get any easier, with second-placed City looking to make it 10 wins in a row on Sunday. Ashley Barnes tussles for possession with Liverpool's Lucas during the Turf Moor loss . Dyche is hoping Burnley's underdog status can help them, saying: 'You have freedom in those games. 'That doesn't guarantee you a result, they're fantastic. They could change the whole team and still be very powerful at this level. 'But we know the expectation is totally on them, as it was with Liverpool. It means the players can go and play. We believe in what we're doing, that's quite obvious.'","Sam Vokes made first appearance of the season for Burnley on Boxing Day .

"Aston Villa’s teenage winger Jack Grealish is set to go out on loan this month to gain experience in the Championship.

"In Tottenham's long and illustrious history, there is no such thing as a routine victory. This club thrives on the thrill of the chase. They are programmed to do everything the hard way and here at White Hart Lane, in this third round replay against Burnley, there was no exception. They set themselves the most strenuous test, conceding twice within the opening seven minutes against Sean Dyche's spirited Burnley team. Spurs got there in the end.

Their recovery means that from the moment Mauricio Pochettino's team set foot at White Hart Lane on Saturday for a 3pm kick off against Sunderland, Spurs will begin a treacherous run of five games in 15 days in three competitions. Dare it be said, with a Capital One Cup semi-final against Sheffield United to come, an FA Cup tie with Leicester and a shot at fourth place in the Barclays Premier League, they are a successful outfit. This is what the players are in the business for and Tottenham deserve to be in the fourth round after this impressive, yet ultimately comfortable, comeback. Tottenham's manager had fiddled with his formation, mixing things up after their setback at Selhurst Park on Saturday, where they were beaten 2-1 by Crystal Palace. To play Michel Vorm in place of Hugo Lloris, to promote Danny Rose to orthodox left wing and to swap Roberto Soldado for the 18 goals of Harry Kane takes some time to acclimatise to. By the end, when they were 4-2 up and turning their attentions to Saturday's clash with Sunderland, they looked the business. To Pochettino's credit there was even a nod in the direction of the long-term future of the club when he sent on young Josh Onomah for the final 14 minutes. There is much more to come from him. Back to Burnley and the incredible and the opening seven minutes of this third round replay. They went in front after two minutes when Marvin Sordell's corkscrew beat Michel Vorm from distance and added another when Ross Wallace's free-kick was guided into the net off the shoulder of Roberto Soldado. It was an eventful evening for the Spurs striker. In the great pantheon of misses, the moment Soldado hit the crossbar from a few yards out with the goal at his mercy is right up there with Ronny Rosenthal at Villa Park in 1992. The Spurs forward has form for this, somehow skying a routine cross in a Europa League tie against FC Dnipro in February last year. Which was worse? It's a tough call. Still, there was something positive about his game, playing his part in the ninth-minute goal that prompted Spurs' comeback at White Hart Lane.

From Andros Townsend's cross down the right, Soldado's flick on fell to Paulinho and the Brazilian midfielder chested the ball down and volleyed beyond Tom Heaton. There was a sense then that the comeback was on, that this Tottenham team would begin to stir after the impressive move that led to that opening goal. After Soldado blew his big chance, Etienne Capoue equalised on the stroke of half-time with a well-placed effort that beat Heaton from distance. Game on. When they emerged for the second half, the impetus was with Tottenham and their fans dreaming of Wembley in the South Stand. It is too soon to check the availability of Chas & Dave, but there will be a few among that number forecasting their ninth FA Cup win in May. There is way to go yet, particularly with the development of this team. Sordell took his early chance, scoring for the first time since his move to Turf Moor on a free transfer from nearby Bolton last summer. His career has plateaued in recent seasons, struggling to make an impression at the Reebok following his £3m move from Watford and farmed out on loan to Charlton last season. Back in London he took his chance for Sean Dyche's side, taking advantage of the customary confusion in Tottenham's defence when Jan Vertonghen and Younes Kaboul failed to clear. Spurs wobbled again, conceding a second when Ross Wallace's left-foot free kick deflected off Soldado and beat diving figure of Vorm. What a start for this Burnley side, making the running and roared on by a few hundred brave supporters clad in claret and blue who made the trip south. Their ambitions to win here ended at the start of the second half when Vlad Chiriches scored their third goal in the 48th minute. Dyche claimed a corner was incorrectly given, launching into the fourth official and yelling at him that there was little point having radio contact with referee Chris Pawson if he didn't use it. The goal appeared telepathic, with Chiriches arriving at the far post to head in Paulinho's corner. Spurs scored again when Soldado set up Rose, steaming into the penalty area, to apply the finishing touch at the far post. They are safely through, but Spurs cannot resist the odd scare.

"Mauricio Pochettino defended his decision to make Emmanuel Adebayor his Captain despite the striker being booed by some fans when he was substituted before Tottenham Hotspur established a 1-0 Capital Cup semi-final lead over Sheffield United. The Spurs manager is keeping faith with the striker despite his most memorable contribution last night being a palm in the face of the Blades 17-year-old midfielder Louis Reed, for which he was shown a yellow card. He was replaced by Roberto Soldado after 64 minutes, before an Andros Townsend penalty gave them a first leg victory. ‘He was happy to get the armband,’ said Pochettino, ‘I see a lot of qualities in him which make him a good captain. I thought he put in a good performance.’ Emmanuel Adebayor cut a frustrated figure  at White Hart Lane, and he was jeered by supporters .

Adebayor, who was jeered by fans, tries to evade the challenge from Sheffield United's Michael Doyle . Pochettino named Adebayor as one of his three captains at the start of the season, alongside regular captain Hugo Lloris and Younes Kaboul. But the Togolese has played just 32 minutes of football since November and scored just twice in 13 appearances this season. But Pochettino thinks he just needs confidence to add to his tally. ‘For a striker it’s important always to score. But in the end we need to give them the confidence that they can improve their performance and maybe have the opportunity to score. Sometimes with a striker when they score once, they score, score and score again.’ Nigel Clough, whose Sheffield United side have gained a reputation for giant killing in the Cups, warned Spurs to expect an intimidating atmosphere for the second leg at Bramall Lane on Wednesday January 28 an . Andros Townsend jumps for joy after scoring from the penalty spot to give Tottenham a first-leg lead . Townsend stepped up and coolly converted to put Tottenham ahead with just over 15 minutes to play . ‘If they score again it will be over but if we can keep it at 1-0 we’ll be in it until last minute,’ said Clough, ‘You heard the noise 4,000 (travelling) fans were making and when 25,000 are in our place next week, it is going to be special. We are going to give it everything we can. ‘We’ve got mixed emotions because we’d have taken 1-0 at the start of the night but we’re disappointed not to come away with a draw.’ Clough denied that arriving late to the stadium due to a massive traffic jam which caused a 15 minute delay to kick-off had any effect on his players. ‘It took us more time to do five miles across London than it did to get from Sheffield on the train. It wasn’t ideal but it had no effect on the result, I thought we started the game brilliantly.’","Tottenham beat Sheffield United 1-0 in the League Cup semi-final first leg .

"Ireland reserve fly-half Paddy Jackson will miss the Six Nations after dislocating his elbow, his province Ulster said on Tuesday, limiting the champions' options with Jonathan Sexton set to miss their opener in Italy.

What would you be if you weren’t a rugby player? Hopefully an Olympian, preferably the shot put. I was pretty good in my younger days. Ireland prop Cian Healy makes a strong run against Scotland during their 2014 Six Nations clash in Dublin . Career highlight? Winning that first Heineken Cup with Leinster (against Leicester in 2009). It had been such a long wait. ... and the Worst moment? Coming home from the Lions tour of Australia (in 2013) because of injury. I tore my ankle ligaments in just the second game. I’d been looking forward to it so much. If your house was burning down, what one possession would you save? My turtle! He’s called Ralph and lives in the kitchen. I’ve had him over five years. I’ve also got two dogs but they have to stay out the back — the turtle was my idea. Healy cites legendary All Blacks winger Jonah Lomu (right) as his all-time sporting hero . What’s the best advice you’ve ever been given? Don’t listen to other people’s advice. I got told that a long time ago from somebody in rugby. Favourite karaoke song? Cotton Eye Joe by Rednex. I’ve sung that once or twice. Am I any good? No, brutal! Three most-listened to songs on your ipod? It wouldn’t be three, I’d shuffle. It’d mainly be house music (Cian also DJs at events such as Oxegen). Last film you saw? I watched Godzilla with some mates. It was all right — does what it says on the tin. Healy suffered ankle ligament damage early in the 2013 Lions tour and subsequently missed the Test series . Last book you read? Couldn’t tell you. I’m not a big reader. if you could invite three people round for dinner, who would they be? Jay-Z and Rihanna — for everything that goes with them, and they’d probably bring their entourages. And Bill Clinton, because I think he’s very insightful. Favourite Pre-match meal? Scrambled eggs and chicken. Can you cook? Best dish? I can and my best dish would be baked salmon with veg. Healy would invite former president of the United States Bill Clinton (above) to a fantasy dinner at his house . Your Favourite holiday destination? Ibiza. Because it’s Ibiza — and I’m all right at dancing. In a film of your life, who would you like to play you? The Rock. He’d make me look bigger. What’s the most expensive thing you’ve ever bought? My car . . . no, my house! Tell us a secret... When I’m DJ-ing, I’m not Cian Healy, I’m DJ Church!

"Dai Young has admitted Leinster's Jimmy Gopperth could replace Andy Goode as Wasps' frontline fly-half next season. Rugby director Young confirmed Wasps are in talks with former Newcastle playmaker Gopperth, and expects his recruitment drive to be complete by the end of January. Young is targeting five players as Wasps build on their move to Coventry's Ricoh Arena, with 'prize asset' Joe Launchbury already tied to a new deal. Leinster's Jimmy Gopperth has opened talks with London Wasps over a possible move . Wasps rugby director Dai Young is keen on finding a long-term replacement for Andy Goode . Goode remains in negotiations over a new Wasps contract, but the 34-year-old's chances could be limited with Scotland's Ruaridh Jackson still to return from long-term knee trouble. The Coventry-born goal-kicker set a new individual Premiership points record of 33 in Wasps' debut at his hometown Ricoh Arena in Sunday's 48-16 victory over London Irish, but is now fighting for his future. 'Absolutely Jimmy Gopperth is in the mix,' said Young. 'There are a number of high-profile 10s that are available this year, and that's all part of the bigger picture. 'We're hoping to be able to resolve that over the next few weeks. 'We're in discussions with Andy about moving things forward, the same as we are with a number of other players. 'We're certainly not far off resolving things on the recruitment front right across the board really, so certainly by the end of January things will be a lot clearer.' Gopperth's Leinster exit has been all-but inevitable since Ireland and British and Irish Lions fly-half Johnny Sexton completed a deal to return to his home province from Racing Metro for next term. The 31-year-old's potential arrival at Wasps next season could leave the picture too crowded for Goode. Rugby director Young has said Gopperth is among a long list of potential targets . The former Leicester and England fly-half offered a timely reminder of his talents in home city Coventry on Sunday as Wasps claimed debut victory at the Ricoh. Former Cardiff boss Young admitted Goode remains confident he can continue to produce the goods at Premiership level. 'Andy certainly seems to think he can keep going, but at the end of the day he's 35 next year isn't he?' said Young. 'Recruitment's not carried out by reacting to one good game or one poor game, though. 'You're looking at what you've got, whether it's right for them as well as us to retain them, and then also at alternatives. 'The move to the Ricoh has helped us in terms of attracting and retaining players. 'We're still in with a shout in Europe but it's hugely important we try to get into the top six in the league again this season to stay in the top European competition. 'Retaining Joe Launchbury has helped too; it is a signal to everyone that things can't be too bad here and that we're moving in the right direction. 'We're probably looking at four or five players to come in, and maybe the same number moving in the other direction. 'But we ought to know a lot more by the end of January.'","London Wasps director Dai Young is interested in signing Jimmy Gopperth .

"Ian Madigan tallied up 19 points as the in-form fly-half masterminded Leinster's 24-11 Guinness PRO12 derby win over Ulster at the RDS Arena. Despite being on the back foot for much of the first half, Leinster led 9-6 at the break thanks to three Madigan penalties - the last of them coming after a yellow card for Ulster's Dan Tuohy. The Ulstermen should have been in front at that stage, especially given the injury-enforced departure of Leinster captain Jamie Heaslip and some passive home defending. Two penalties from the fit-again Ruan Pienaar had given them an early lead. Ian Madigan tallied up 19 points as the in-form fly-half masterminded Leinster's 24-11  derby win over Ulster . The visitors fell further behind following an opportunist Madigan try in the 42nd minute, before prop Wiehahn Herbst's first touchdown in Ulster colours cut the gap to 16-11. But Madigan's fourth successful penalty, coupled with a deserved late try from man-of-the-match Jack Conan, saw Leinster bounce back impressively from last week's disappointing defeat to Munster. Crisp passing from scrum half Pienaar saw Ulster make early headway, Tuohy tearing through midfield and Leinster required a terrific Fergus McFadden turnover to relieve the pressure. Leinster enjoyed some attacking phases before Tuohy's bone-crunching tackle on Jack McGrath and follow-up by Darren Cave saw Pienaar go for goal from his own half. His well-struck kick came back off the crossbar. The South African made amends two minutes later, splitting the posts from just inside the Leinster half, before Madigan responded in the 21st minute following a weaving run from excellent centre Luke Fitzgerald. Ulster fired back with some potent midfield play as Paddy Jackson and Stuart Olding grew in influence. Leinster were pinged for not rolling away and Pienaar restored his side's three-point advantage. Jack Conan dives over the line to score Leinster's second try of the afternoon at the RDS Arena . With a hamstring tweak forcing Shane Jennings' late withdrawal before kick-off, Leinster suffered a second back-row setback with the very rare sight of Heaslip going off injured with a shoulder injury. Madigan lifted Leinster spirits with a levelling penalty past the half hour mark, the dancing feet of Fitzgerald again outfoxing the Ulster defence initially. But Leinster enjoyed some welcome territory approaching half-time, with the penalties beginning to stack up against the visitors. Tuohy needlessly dived in off his feet to take out scrum half Isaac Boss and following the Ulster lock's sin-binning, Madigan converted from in front of the posts. A left wing raid by Madigan and Jordi Murphy, coupled with a strong Zane Kirchner carry near the posts, had 14-man Ulster under immediate pressure in the second period. Crucially, they switched off at a five-metre penalty. Madigan feigned a kick to touch, instead tapping it and rolling out of a Callum Black tackle to touch down. Leinster's talisman added the conversion but Neil Doak's charges created a well-worked try seven minutes later, tighthead Herbst driving over to the right of the posts with support from fellow South African Franco van der Merwe. Pienaar was unable to convert at 16-11 and after Devin Toner went close during a power-packed spell of carrying, Madigan's reliable right boot put eight points between the sides. Pienaar was wide and short with a left-sided penalty entering the final quarter, and Ulster's challenge gradually petered out. Leinster duly closed out their fifth successive victory over their provincial rivals with a try from flanker Conan, who burst on to Luke McGrath's short pass to go over in the left corner.","Ian Madigan tallied 19 points for Leinster against Ulster .

"CLICK HERE to read the views from Sportsmail columnist Eddie Hearn . Eddie Hearn has moved to tempt Amir Khan into a blockbuster fight with Kell Brook by suggesting a winner-takes-all deal. Khan has repeatedly been dismissive of a fight with the IBF welterweight world champion as he pursues Floyd Mayweather. But with that bout seemingly unlikely, Hearn has told Khan ‘it’s big balls time’. He claims to have offered Khan $5million (£3.3m) to make a match before Brook became world champion. Amir Khan poses with his WBC Silver Welterweight title, which he retained against Devon Alexander . Khan lands a right hand on Alexander (left) in December and celebrated with promoter Oscar de la Hoya . Now, with Brook’s IBF belt, he claims even more money would be available for what could be a major stadium fight next summer. Hearn told Sportsmail: ‘He knows where we are. He has so much to lose in fighting Kell but is adamant he would win with ease. If he truly believes that then this is the fight that would make him more money than any other. ‘I offered Khan $5m to take the fight before Kell won a world title. With a world title involved, the pot of money for this fight is even bigger. If Khan truly thinks he could beat Kell, then he should step up. Kell Brook said he was the 'victim of an unprovoked attack' when he was stabbed on holiday last September . ‘I would back Kell every day of the week to win that fight. This year is going to be a big year for him and Amir wants the lion's share of the pot - we are more than happy to have a 60-40 for the winner or 70-30 for the winner. In fact, how about winner takes all? It's big balls time.’ Brook will fight on March in Sheffield for the first time following the horrific machete attack in Tenerife that left him fearing for his life.

The world No 2 was on the brink of a shock defeat at the hands of her Russian compatriot but somehow triumphed 6-1, 4-6, 7-5 in a Rod Laver Arena thriller lasting two hours and 32 minutes.

"It’s the middle of the night and I’ve just been woken up at 3am by the feral sound of snow leopards mating. I’m nowhere near the big cats’ wild habitat found in the rugged mountain ranges of Central Asia but ensconced in the centre of a city at Sydney’s Taronga Zoo. The wildlife park is part of a global snow leopard breeding program aimed at boosting the numbers of the internationally endangered species – and judging from the roars echoing across the compound, it’s proving successful. Lighting up the night: Roar and Snore at Taronga Zoo gives guests the chance to explore the park at night . Not for the squeamish: A zoo guide introduces a small spotted python snake to the group . Getting to stay at the zoo overnight is all part of Taronga’s aptly named Roar & Snore experience which promises unrivalled views of Sydney and up-close animal encounters after the park’s doors have closed to the public. Carefully watching where we were going, we make our way through the huge compound, spotting giraffes and nocturnal creatures come out to see what all the noise was as we passed. Taronga has some of the most impressive views of the Sydney skyline available and when we made it to our tents we found they all overlooked the stunning harbour, lit up by stars and lights from the city. Important message: While meeting the animals, the guides told us about the history of the zoo and its various conservation projects . Nighttime tour: Zoo guides then took us for a late evening stroll around the grounds. As well as being able to see numerous nocturnal animals, we watched Himalayan mountain goats being fed . Lethal: Roar and Snore offers the opportunity to see big cats including tigers, lions and snow leopards at night . Each huge tent boasts a large double bed and a single – enough to accommodate four people – with electric blankets to complete the ‘glamping’ experience. After dumping our belongings, we found ourselves in the main tent where we were greeted with glasses of champagne, cheese and nibbles while our guides talked us through the history of the zoo. Taronga is home to more than 4,000 animals, including some of the world’s most endangered species such as Asian elephants and Sumatran tigers. Glamping: Guests stay in their own tents which accommodate up to four people each. Roar and Snore has a maximum capacity of 44 people per night . First rays of light: After a good night 's sleep in some very cozy beds, it was time to watch the sun come up . The guides are rightly proud of the not-for-profit zoo's conservation efforts and they talk us through various projects including the Wildlife Witness app which allows users to report incidents of illegal animal trade. The Roar & Snore experience attracts a wide variety of guests; as well as our group, there were couples, whole families and grandparents with their grandchildren. After a brief introduction, it was soon time for our first animal encounter and the guides brought in a range of blue tongue lizards, bearded dragons and a small spotted python snake. Beautiful view to wake up to: All the tents look over the harbour towards the city centre . Viewing point: We quickly grabbed some breakfast before taking in the view of Sydney at sunrise . Best way to start the day: The city of Sydney sparkled as the sun comes up over the harbour . While still clutching our wine glasses or cheese in one hand, we were each allowed to stroke the fascinating (and slightly terrifying) creatures. One member of our group, Danielle, expressed her love of snakes until the guide, who had the python carefully wrapped around her arm, started detailing how they can kill their prey by strangling them causing everyone nearby to take a few steps back. Having never been that fond of reptiles, I was more than happy to move on to the next part of the stay, a night-time tour around the zoo. On the prowl: After breakfast, it's back to the enclosures for the big cats, which no longer look sleepy . Ready for his close-up: We got to see the tigers before the park opens to the general public - meaning we had perfect, unobstructed views of the magnificent animals . Rare sighting: We also made a quick visit to see the zoo's male snow leopard Khumbu who briefly shared his enclosure with his 11-year-old mate Samara the night before . Carrying our torches with red filters so they wouldn’t hurt animals’ eyes, we went to visit the big cat enclosures where we got to see one of the zoo’s budding romances first-hand – seven-year-old male snow leopard Khumbu and his 11-year-old mate Samara. While the couple weren’t up to any shenanigans while we were there, just to see them both in the same enclosure is a rare sight as they are only put together at night at specific times so they can breed. Samara has already has two cubs with another male in 2005 but has yet to reproduce any offspring with Khumbu. We then headed off for a delicious buffet dinner washed down with a bit more wine before heading to feed the Himalayan goats, a species so gentle they manage to scare themselves. We then went on another tour of the park - this time in the daylight. Along the way we saw some stunning birds, including this pelican . Feeding time: Zoo keepers throw food to some of the zoo's elephant inhabitants . Keepers even had to start feeding them at night as they would be too scared to venture off their rock enclosure to the ground and birds would eat all their food. As it started approaching 11pm, it was time to head back to our tents where we had hot chocolates and desserts before tucking up in our pre-heated beds. The tents are airy and spacious and you drift off to sleep to the sounds of birds, squawks and roars. But as magical as the night had been, the real gem of Roar & Snore is the morning when you wake to see the sun rise over Sydney and turn all the skyscrapers a bright gold. Hungry: One of the zoo keepers introduced the group to three of the zoo's giraffes as she fed them the first meal of their day . Soaking up the sun: Kangaroos enjoy their breakfast and relax in the sunshine before the park opens . There’s then time for a quick shower (with hot water) before going for a daylight tour of the zoo before it opens to the masses. I quickly queried our guide over the sounds that had woken us up in the night and was told it was most likely the snow leopards we had met the night before enjoying their alone time. Our first stop was the giraffe enclosure where we were each given a handful of carrots to feed them which generally resulted in the animals slobbering all over our hands with their huge blue tongues. With time running short before the zoo opened, we were then whisked off for the final part of the private tour - a series of close-up encounters with furry animals. First up were some energetic feathertail gliders – the world’s smallest gliding possums which are around the size of a field mouse and move just as quickly, making them quite a handful as some guests quickly realised as they tried to clamper up arm sleeves and jump on to people’s faces. Celebrity of the zoo: We even got to meet Pepper - the same koala who greeted the Duchess of Cambridge and Prince George on their visit . Friends in high places: Kate and Prince William met Pepper (pictured left) on their visit to the zoo in April 2014 . Strong aroma: Once you get up close to a koala, the smell of eucalyptus becomes quite overpowering . We then met the current celebrity of the zoo – a koala named Pepper who greeted the Duchess of Cambridge and Prince George on their visit to Taronga. While we weren’t allowed to stroke him like Kate & Wills, we could get close enough to smell his pungent aroma and the eucalyptus leaves he munches on all day long. After meeting a few more furry friends, it was time for the zoo to open and our private tour came to end. But all Roar & Snore guests are then free to spend the rest of the day exploring the remainder of the zoo, meeting the other animals and seeing the best view Sydney has to offer in the daylight.","Up to 44 guests a night can camp - or rather 'glamp' - at the zoo overnight .

"The mammoth effort to transport four Asian elephants almost 400km has already kicked off ahead of their trip from Sydney to Dubbo later this year. Mothers Porntip and Thong Dee along with their calves Pathi Harn and Luk Chai will be packed into special crates and transported by road from Taronga Zoo to Western Plains Zoo. Months ahead of their trip, staff at Taronga have started the process of familiarising them with their temporary homes for a few hours en route to their destination. Scroll down for video . Four Asian elephants - including two mothers and two calves - will be transferred to Western Plains Zoo later this year . The herd of elephants will enable Western Plains Zoo to actively take part in the conservation of the Asian elephant species for the first time. At the moment the zoo has two Asian elephants, Burma and Gigi, are over the age for breeding. Burma is 60 years old and Gigi is 57 years old. A 750sq m extension at Western Plains Zoo will include a new elephant barn and two extra paddocks in the purpose-built breeding habitat on top two other elephant barns, pools, mud wallows and shade structures. It has been designed so the two young male calves can move away when they are weened off their mothers, which reflects what would happen in the wild. Female elephants, known as cows, usually stay with their young in herds, but male elephants - called bulls - usually live alone. They will take part in the zoo's first ever breeding program and join two other Asian elephants . They will be transported almost 400km by road in special crates . When the kids fly the coop, Taronga elephant manager Gary Miller said the mothers would get 'a new lease on life'. 'They’re going to relax tremendously because right now they’re looking over their shoulders all the time about what the young bulls are going to do,' he said. 'Are they going to sneak up on them or are they going to play fight or whatever? 'A lot of the time it’s good fun but they always have to be on their guard because when a young bull decides he wants to have fun who knows when that could be because it could be in the middle of the night, so they’re always a little bit on guard about that.' Preparations for the Asian elephants' transfer have already started with them being introduced to special crates. One of the mothers, Porntip, took quite a liking to the the box. The elephants' names are Porntip, Thong Dee, Pathi Harn and Luk Chai . The purpose-built breeding grounds will have a 750sq m extension built on it . 'Porntip we call her our go-go girl because she likes to go places,' Mr Miller said. 'When we brought the new crate into the barn she was itching to get over to it and to see what it was all about and get into it so again she likes to go see new things. She’s a traveller.' The redevelopment of the elephant facility is due for completion late 2014. The plan is for the Elephants from Taronga Zoo to arrive late 2014 or earlier 2015. The improved facility in Dubbo is expected to be finished by late 2014 .","Elephants Porntip, Thong Dee, Pathi Harn and Luk Chai will move to Dubbo .

"Britain has abandoned its allotments, and Mary Berry is to blame, local representatives have said. The decline in interest in growing vegetables is said to be a result of amateur gardeners  becoming obsessed with baking the perfect cake, in the wake of the success of the Great British Bake Off. Before Berry hit our screens in 2010, allotment sites around the country would have hundreds fighting for a plot, but now, the waiting lists are near non-existent. Blaming Berry: Since the Great British Bake Off, with judges Mary Berry and Paul Hollywood, first premiered in 2010, there has been a steady decline in interest in allotments . Since the emergence of the Great British Bake Off, Brits are more interested in avoiding soggy bottoms than getting on their knees in the garden, and no longer line up for allotments. 'Four years ago when allotment demand was at a peak, every time you switched on the television, someone was growing vegetables. Now every time you switch on the TV, people are baking cakes,' says Fiona Warin, allotment officer at Cheltenham Borough Council in Gloucestershire, said. In 2010, Cheltenham had 465 people on their waiting list, and amateur gardeners would have to wait up to four years for a plot. Four years later, the number has more than halved, and less than 200 people now want an allotment in Cheltenham. Ms Warin says similar drops in interest has been seen throughout the South West . Less popular: In 2010, Cheltenham Borough Council had 465 people on their waiting list for allotments, a number which is now 'less  than 200' Star bakers: The decline in numbers of keen gardeners lining up for an allotment plot is said to be because it is now more fashionable to bake cupcakes and showstoppers . More interesting: This years Great British Bake Off finalists Luis Troyano, Nancy Birtwhistle and Richard Burr . She added: 'We know that TV has a huge impact. 'There was an allotment challenge on BBC a couple of months ago and it caused a big spike in allotment demand overnight, which then dropped right back again. The National Allotment Society said it first noticed the impact of 'Bake Off' around two years ago. National Allotment Society spokesman Allan Cavill said that there is no single cause for the drop in numbers but that the Great British Bake Off is definitely 'a contributory factor. Mr Cavill, 72, said his plot in Taunton, Somerset, used to have a constant waiting list of 50, but now people can get one straight away. 'There is certainly a generation that took up allotments maybe eight or nine years ago, who have now moved from growing potatoes to making cupcakes. 'But I've been around long enough to know it will all come round again. 'People will come back - maybe not in my lifetime, but they will.

"If Louis van Gaal needs persuading to take Radamel Falcao on a permanent deal at the end of the season, then he'll still be in two minds after the match at Queens Park Rangers. The Manchester United man has warned the Colombian he must prove he is worth a long-term contract with goals. Falcao fluffed his lines big time at Loftus Road on Saturday, missing a series of chances to make his point to Van Gaal. Radamel Falcao stands in the middle of the Loftus Road pitch with his hands on his hips . The Manchester United star (left) posted a victory picture with team-mate Victor Valdes on his Instagram . Falcao smashes a shot towards the Queens Park Rangers goal for Manchester United . Karl Henry (left) and Clint Hill (right) of QPR challenge Falcao during the first-half at Loftus Road . Falcao touched the ball four times in the QPR box . The first came in the 13th minute, taking down Juan Mata's superb lofted pass on his chest, Falcao had time to pick his spot - he shot straight at Rob Green, though. Beyond that, his first-half involvement was minimal. While United were dominant in possession, the South American was being starved of decent service. But if Falcao thought his first-half was one to forget, worse was to follow. Unmarked from six yards, the striker somehow failed to direct his angled header from Angel di Maria's cross past Green, who made an excellent stop in the 56th minute. The Colombia international will have nightmares about kicking thin air with the goal gaping from six yards after Daley Blind's low cross in the 76th minute. It was one for the end of season blooper show. QPR's goalkeeper Rob Green (left) rushes out to deny Falcao when the Colombian takes a shot at him .

"Posing for pictures with fans is all part of the Manchester United job; but there was something different about this one. A young fan, who bore a striking resemblance to United chief Louis van Gaal, has got social media buzzing after snapping a picture of the two of them during The Red Devils' 2-0 win over QPR. The photo which has since gone viral has invited plenty of witty captions with some fans even suggesting that the Dutchman had traveled back in time to meet his younger self.

"Plus-size trendsetter Gabi Gregg has finally launched a second collection for Swimsuits For All today, filled with retro-style bikinis, tankinis, and maillot styles that come in brightly-colored prints. The designs follow the 26-year-old writer’s inaugural design outing for the online retailer, which left fans disappointed when the collection sold out in less than 48 hours last May. Much like her first swimsuit range, Miss Gregg’s new designs are offered in sizes 10 through 24 and hark back to the Fifties with high-waist ruched bottoms and full-coverage underwire tops. They are presently available for pre-sale and will ship after April 16. Styling: Following the success of Ms Gregg's blog, GabiFresh, she has designed a range of sellout swimwear for plus-size women (pictured in one of her designs) Miss Gregg’s second batch of designs for Swimsuits For All range in price from $43.50 for a bikini, to $58.50 for a ruffled tankini. These prices reflect the 25per cent promotional discount that Swimsuits For All is currently offering site-wide. Miss Gregg, a size 18 herself, has named the collection after her blogging alter-ego GabiFresh. She rose to acclaim last year after posting a call to action on her blog for plus-size readers to send  photos of themselves wearing swimsuits. Thirty-one women responded to the call, and were featured on Miss Gregg’s site in a photo gallery which she titled ‘Fatkini’. Shortly after, Miss Gregg signed a deal with Swimsuits For All, telling fans of the collection on her site: ‘I'm super passionate about plus size women wearing great swimsuits unapologetically. Retro designs: Miss Gregg's designs accentuate a woman's curves with nostalgic, 1950s-inspired silhouettes . Many sized: Miss Gregg's collection comes in sizes 10 to 24 . ‘After all of the excitement surrounding last year's Fatkini, I thought designing a few of my own would be a wonderful way to continue the movement.’ Upon the collection’s online release last May, she told Refinery 29 of  the designs: ‘I think swimsuit shopping can be horrendous if you're going to stores that don't offer your size, but finding a stylish option that fits you well can actually make you feel great!’ Miss Gregg’s outlook on swimwear resonated so strongly with fans that the collection sold out in just hours. Bright patters: Each of the suits come in bright patterns, and are priced between $43 and $58 . Hundreds of consumers who had placed orders for the designs were left disappointed when they received notice that their orders could not be filled. One, a shopper named Bella, commented on Miss Gregg’s Instagram account: 'I ordered mine 9am May 15th after waiting over a month for the release to get a call today that my order was cancelled because they ran out.' Swimsuits For All is looking to avoid this disappointment with their current pre-sale of Miss Gregg’s collection – which will help the site gauge how many suits should be produced.","Miss Gregg's first collection for online retailer Swimsuits For All sold out within 48 hours .

"Chedwyn Evans, a 25-year-old rapist, emerged from the gates of Wymott Prison two hours before dawn. He climbed into a silver Mercedes 4x4 and raced away through the slumbering Lancashire streets. And with his release, English professional football was confronted by the kind of crisis which will test both its basic competence and its moral authority. Now most football ‘crises’ are little more than frivolous fodder for the back pages: this young footballer complains of feeling ‘tired’, that team loses three games in a row, this insufferable manager announces that referees are in malevolent conspiracy against him. Tales full of sound and fury, signifying nothing. But this one is different. This one will ask important questions of a kind that the sport may struggle to answer. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Should Sheffield United re-sign Ched Evans? Ched Evans, pictured in action for Sheffield United in 2009 (left) and 2012 (right), was released from prison . The facts are widely known. In 2011, Evans, a footballer with Sheffield United, raped an inebriated 19-year-old woman in a hotel room in North Wales. He was tried, convicted and sentenced to five years’ imprison-ment. He was refused leave to appeal. In the words of the Lord Chief Justice Lord Judge: ‘We can see no possible basis which would justify us interfering with the verdict of the jury, which heard all the evidence and reflected on it after careful summing up by the judge’. Shortly after the trial, the victim’s identity was revealed by the trolls of social media. As a result of the subsequent abuse, she was forced to adopt a new identity and leave her home town. A 4x4 carrying convicted rapist Ched Evans leaves Wymott Prison in Lancashire at 5am on Friday . The Welsh footballer, who last played for Sheffield United, has served half his five-year sentence for rape . Evans was released on Friday, halfway through his sentence and a storm came crashing around his head. Almost 150,000 people had signed a petition, appealing to the Sheffield United chairman Kevin McCabe not to reinstate him as a player. To accede to the appeal would require strong nerve and firm principle, since they once paid £3million for Evans’ services. Gordon Taylor, chief executive of the Professional Footballers’ Association, argued that Evans has served his sentence and should therefore be allowed to return to his work. The temperature was significantly raised by Judy Finnigan, a daytime television performer, who prattled: ‘He didn’t cause any bodily harm to the person... and she had far too much to drink. It was reprehensible, but he has served his time.’ She later apologised for her dimly offensive outburst but not before she had been swatted by Vera Baird, the Northumbria police and crime commissioner, who said: ‘He raped her — that is a serious injury. If you get drunk and someone steals your wallet, does this mean it’s any less of a theft than if you were sober?’ Such is the story so far and football’s dilemma is taking shape. There are powerful arguments on both sides. Should Sheffield United, who were apparently paying Evans at the rate of £20,000 a week for the first part of his sentence, cut their ties and send him packing? Or should they opt for mercy and redemption and restore him to a team for whom he has scored 48 goals in 113 matches? In truth, we would have more confidence in a reasoned, equitable conclusion if the game’s record in these matters were not so dubious. Recall, for instance, that sleazy furore of last May, when Richard Scudamore — chief executive of the Premier League and therefore the most powerful man in the sport — was shown to have sent a series of crude, sexist emails. You will recall his mocking of ‘female irrationality’, the juvenile smut of his story of a former girlfriend, whom he called ‘double decker’, for reasons which he leeringly explained. There was also his tasteful re-telling of a ‘male fairy-tale’ about a prince who was proposed to, said no, then lived happily ever after and ‘banged skinny big-titted broads’. The Premier League launched a rigorous inquiry, conducted by one of Scudamore’s bosom chums, then declared that their leader, who keeps their money rolling in, was not remotely sexist. His subsequent apology took some time. The first self-justifying diatribe contained not a smidgeon of sincerity, while the second was almost as weak. No matter. Football was satisfied. Move on, nothing to see here. Premier League chief executive Richard Scudamore at a game between Manchester City and West Ham in May . Then, just last week, the garrulous Rio Ferdinand was charged with misconduct by the FA after responding to a Twitter follower who taunted that QPR needed a decent centre-half. ‘Get ya mum in’, said Ferdinand. ‘Plays the field well son! #sket’. A dictionary search revealed that “sket” is a Caribbean term for a whore. Some might wonder about the sinister mind that comes up with such a slur. I doubt that Ferdinand is much given to introspection. This, then, is the climate in which Sheffield United must make their decision: brash, jokey, heavy on blokeish ‘banter’, devoid of saving sensitivity. Overt racism is thankfully unacceptable, but sexism, the ‘she-must-have-asked-for-it’ culture, is alive and well and thriving unchecked in English football. Rio Ferdinand was charged with misconduct after responding to a Twitter follower . Sheffield United must decide whether they are to allow Evans (pictured in action in 2012) back . I have no idea how Kevin McCabe and his board will decide the Ched Evans issue. I hope they will not be swayed by that petition, since such talent-show tactics are not the way important questions should be settled. Equally, I hope that the earnest but ill-judged efforts of the player’s friends will not prove decisive. In any event, we should not envy McCabe’s predicament. Somebody observed this week that football is the victim in all this. They were quite wrong. For the victim is a 19-year-old woman who had taken too much to drink. And found herself in the wrong place, at the wrong time, with the wrong person. P.S. In a week dominated by the release of Ched Evans and football’s disturbing views on violence towards women, one voice was strangely silent. Helen Grant, who is rumoured to be Minister for Sport, might have been expected to lead this particular debate. And yet she had nothing to say. She never has. Minister of sport Helen Grant (right) with Premier League chief executive Scudamore in 2013 . The sport ministry, devoid of funds, influence and power is scorned by ambitious politicians. But even its most inept occupants have, on occasion, found the nerve to make a point and state a case. Not Ms Grant. She just keeps her head down and waits for the moment to pass. It is surely time she was put out of her misery. Be sure she would go quietly. Manchester City owner Sheik Mansour . City fulfil their Eastern promise . The footballers of Manchester City have moved into a new home. To nobody’s surprise, it is almost unimaginably lavish: the Etihad Campus has 16 pitches, an artificial pitch, a 7,000-seater stadium, as well as a training and medical block and a sixth-form college. The wider development, also backed by the owners of the club, involves a £1billion boost in 6,000 homes and shops in a neglected part of the city. No club has ever known such resources, but then, none has enjoyed the energetic backing of Sheik Mansour and his colleagues. There are those who suggest that such largesse is deceptive, that it is part of a plan to make the Sheik’s of Abu Dhabi more acceptable to the wider world. And, given Abu Dhabi’s human rights record, they may have a point. But the fact is that they are making a difference to the wider community as well as their fortuitously chosen football club. No other owner has made a remotely comparable impact upon his local area; not Abramovich at Chelsea, nor the Glazers at United, and certainly not that popular fellow who owns Newcastle. There are many reasons to regret the influx of foreign owners into the Premier League. But the massively improved condition of East Manchester is not among them.
