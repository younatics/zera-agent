"A showdown over the passports of so called 'foreign fighters' – Americans and other westerners who have joined the ISIS terror army in Iraq and Syria – came to a head on Thursday when a U.S. senator killed legislation aiming to strip them of their citizenship. Democrat Mazie Hirono, a freshman senator from Hawaii, objected on the Senate floor when Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas tried to fast-track his 'Expatriate Terrorists Act.’ Cruz bypassed the Senate's committee process in order to rush the legislation to a vote, meaning that any single senator could block it. Since the Senate is sprinting through its final days in session this year, he said, putting the bill through committee 'would mean that it could not pass in time to prevent Americans fighting right now with ISIS from coming back and murdering other Americans.' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Texas Republican Sen. Ted Cruz aimed to win quick approval for his bill, which considers aiding an anti-American terror group to be an 'affirmative renunciation' of US citizenship . Not just Americans, US allies too: Interpol is searching for two Austrian teenage girls who traveled to Syria to fight on the side of Islamist militants . Hawaii Democratic Sen. Mazie Hirono blocked the legislation, saying she and other Democrats wanted more time -- and likely pushing the issue off until after the November elections . 'There is an urgency and an exigency to this situation,' Cruz said on the Senate floor. Hirono said she chose to throw up a road block because 'legislation that grants the government the ability to strip citizenship from Americans is a serious matter raising significant constitutional issues.' She also cited letters of objection from the Constitution Project and the American Civil Liberties Union. The question of what to do about ISIS-aligned foreign fighters who have U.S. passports has occupied the attention of the FBI, the Homeland Security Department and the State Department, which issues passports and can revoke them if a judge agrees there's a compelling reason. In testimony Thursday before the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Secretary of State John Kerry argued that the U.S. needs 'to stop the foreign fighters who carry passports from countries around the world including the United States.' 'What I want to make certain, Kerry told the congressional panel, 'is that anybody who has a passport [and joins with ISIS] 'who returns, returns in handcuffs – not through customs with their passport.' 'I don't think these guys are ten feet tall,' he said later. Committee chairman Rep. Ed Royce, a California Republican, agreed. 'I think we need a way to approach this to make certain that their ability to come into the United States is made a hell of a lot more difficult than it is right now,' Royce told the secretary. But Kerry warned about the possibility of interfering with law enforcement, saying that canceling a passport could give suspected terrorists a heads-up that they've been identified in Washington. 'We ... need to do that with sensitivity to certain investigations that may be going on,' said Kerry, 'because you don't want to flag something.' In the same hearing, Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson said that 'the suspension of passports should be considered on a case-by-case basis,' not with a law that drives every circumstance toward a single outcome. 'Suspension and revocation of passports can be done on an expedited basis when the situation warrants, in a matter of hours or days,' he said. Not just ISIS: Al-Shabab, an al-Qaeda affiliate active in Somalia, has seen several Americans join their fight, mostly from a Minnesota suburb with a high concentration of Muslims and Somali immigrants . Secretary of State John Kerry told the House Foreign Affairs Committee on Thursday that he wants to see American 'foreign fighters' coming back to the US in handcuffs, not through customs . FBI Director James Comey (left) and Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson (right) said immediately canceling passports of ISIS foreign fighters might interfere with law-enforcement investigations . FBI director James Comey said passport revocation is 'of interest to us,' but added that the U.S. can't do much to stop foreigners from friendly nations entering the U.S. – even if they're aligned ith ISIS. The United States and its allies have identified people of French, Belgian, British and Australian origin who are confirmed to be ISIS-aligned foreign fighters. Without a safeguard, they would be able to enter the country without travel visas. Comey said the FBI might encounter 'due process' challenges trying to persuade a court to cancel a passport for terrorism-related reasons, since much of the evidence in such cases would consist of secret intelligence. 'How would I protect sources and methods?' he asked. 'How would we be able to use, if at all, classified information to make the showing that would be necessary? Comey also said a one-size-fits all mandate to strip the citizenship of foreign fighters might impede law enforcement investigations. 'Sometimes it makes sense under limited circumstances,' he said, 'to let somebody back in and cover them very closely to see who they connect with.' 'Sometimes,' he added, 'it makes sense to let them come back in the country and lock 'em up right away.'","Sen. Mazie Hirono, a Hawaii Democrat, stood to object when Texas GOP Sen. Ted Cruz asked for 'unanimous consent' to pass his bill quickly .
The measure would have terminated the citizenship of any American who joins or assists a terror group that's likely to attack US interests .
Hirono insisted that the bill raised constitutional questions and cited complaints from the American Civil Liberties Union .
Secretary of State John Kerry told Congress that 'foreign fighters' who help ISIS should return 'in handcuffs – not through customs with their passport'
Kerry said he has authority to cancel passports; the FBI director said it's sometimes useful to let terrorists back into the country and watch them ."
"A primary school teacher who tried to have sex with a 10 year old student and had his name tattooed on her chest in an infinity symbol has escaped jail time. Diane Brimble, 47, appeared at the County Court of Victoria on Thursday and was handed a two year correction order. Judge Mark Taft sentenced Brimble to 200 hours of community service and ordered her to be placed on the sex offender register for eight years. The mother of eight was convicted by a jury in August of a single charge of committing an indecent act which involved hugging and kissing the boy while asking him to have sex in 2013. Diane Brimble was sentenced to 200 hours of community service after she was convicted of a single charge of committing an indecent act on . She was acquitted of five other charges and will never teach again. In handing down his judgement, the Judge Taft said he was at a complete loss to understand why Brimble would carry out such conduct but noted she was unlikely to reoffend. Judge Taft also made reference to a letter Brimble wrote to her victim in which she said 'I love you more than you ever know' and 'there will never be anyone else in my heart'. The full note read: 'I miss you more than words can say. I can't write how much I miss you because there just aren't enough words. 'I love you more than you will ever know. There will never be anyone else in my heart. Though you will be so far away when I leave I will still see you every night in my dreams just as I do now. 'Infinite love, forever in my heart. Always and forever.' Judge Taft said: 'It beggars belief that a mature teacher should write such a letter to her student.' The mother of eight, 47, grabbed the 10-year-old victim while he was in her home and asked him to sleep with her . She was acquitted of five other charges and will never teach again . 'I reject suggestion that inexperience as a new teacher and naivety explain your behaviour,' he told the court. Judge Taft also said: 'You breached the trust reposed in you by (the boy's) parents who properly expected that a classroom teacher would care for their son in a professional manner.' 'Your offending occurred in a context of obsessive and entirely misdirected affection for (the boy) which you described as ""love"".' The court heard the offence occurred in 2013 when Brimble was the child's teacher and lived next door to the 10 year old's family. The boy had been at a friends house with Brimble's own family when she drove him and her children back to her home. 'In the hallway, you grabbed (the boy), hugged him, asked him if he would sleep with you that night and have sex,' Judge Taft told the court. '(The boy) asked you why he would sleep with you and you told him that you loved him. He pushed your hands away and you kissed him on the cheek. I miss you more than words can say. I can't write how much I miss you because there just aren't enough words. I love you more than you will ever know. There will never be anyone else in my heart. Though you will be so far away when I leave I will still see you every night in my dreams just as I do now. Infinite love, forever in my heart. Always and forever. 'He told you that he was not old enough to have sex and you said 'You are when you're at my house'. The boy's mother had earlier told the court Brimble turned her son into a 'sexual commodity'. She had lured the boy to her rose-covered home in Hamilton in country Victoria for sex, the court heard. Just two years after graduating from university to take her 'dream come true' job teaching primary schoolkids, 47-year-old Brimble was exposing her breasts to the boy, asking him for sex and showing him condoms and sex toys. She had a framed photo of the boy on her bedside table and designed a tattoo with the words 'love for' and his name in an infinity symbol. The boy's mother told the court they had to move from their community and the boy was placed on antipsychotic medication. The boy's mother had earlier told the court Brimble turned her son into a 'sexual commodity' Brimble had the boy's name tattooed on her chest in an infinity symbol, like the one above . She said it also impacted on his siblings. 'They drew pictures of rainbows and unicorns. He drew black pictures of knives and death,' she said, reading her victim impact statement to the court. The father said the boy would not look at his parents as he believed Brimble had cast a spell on him, so she could see and hear everything he did. The father's victim impact statement was read to the court by prosecutor Patrick Bourke, who said Brimble tried to tour the boy's new school and enrol her children there. He said his son, who has Asperger's syndrome, said Brimble was 'on him'. 'She tried to manipulate [him] to make him think she loved him and his parents did not,' the statement read out by prosecutor Patrick Bourke said. 'I feel sick every time I think of my son's name tattooed on her body.' Brimble faced court in August charged with five counts of committing an indecent act with a child aged under 16 years, and one charge of using a telecommunications device to groom a child. She pleaded not guilty to all six charges. Brimble was convicted by a jury in August of a single charge of committing an indecent act which involved hugging and kissing the boy while asking him to have sex in 2013 . The boy Brimble approached  had to be placed on antipsychotic medication after the event in November 2013 . A jury took two days to find her not guilty of the child grooming charge and four other charges, but convicted her of committing an indecent act which involved hugging and kissing the boy while asking him to have sex. Before she fell in love with the 10-year-old boy, tattooed his name on her chest and made him believe she had cast a spell on him, Brimble had once been described as a selfless 'supermum'. During the trial at Warrnambool County Court – just minutes from the university campus where she had so proudly graduated in 2011 – Brimble was described as exhibiting 'bizarre' conduct and a baffling 'psycho sexual profile'. Barrister Jennifer Clark, on behalf of Brimble, said her client had developed an affection beyond the normal teacher/student relationship, 'but she has not overstepped into criminal conduct'. Ms Clark said Brimble had endured a difficult life and an abusive marriage which she had fought hard to overcome by becoming a teacher. The boy's parents labelled Brimble an 'evil woman' and feel 'disgusted' A jury took two days to find Brimble (left) guilty, despite her defence arguing 'she has not overstepped into criminal conduct'","Mother-of-eight Diane Brimble tried to have sex with 10-year-old student in her house .

"Stanislas Wawrinka opened his ATP World Tour Finals campaign in stunning fashion with a straight-sets demolition of Tomas Berdych. The Swiss took just 58 minutes to beat his out-of-sorts Czech opponent 6-1, 6-1 and go top of Group A, with world No 1 Novak Djokovic and US Open champion Marin Cilic due to face off later on Monday night. Wawrinka had arrived here having won just one of his last five matches but there was no sign of that recent poor form as he earned an early break in the second game with a nervy Berdych firing a forehand wide.

Wawrinka had a set point for a first-serve bagel but Berdych saved with an ace and finally got on the board, before Wawrinka held to wrap up the first set in just 25 minutes. Things got no better for Berdych in the second set as a lengthy third game ended with Wawrinka claiming the break courtesy of his trademark one-handed backhand which was too powerful for Berdych to get back. Wawrinka's victory earned him 200 ranking points as he fightsto keep his place in the world top four . Wawrinka then reeled off the next four games in quick succession to clinch victory, as well as 200 ranking points which will prove handy as he bids to retain his place in the world's top four. Wawrinka said: 'I didn't expect to win that easy in the score, for sure. But I was ready to play well. 'I had a great week of preparation. I worked really, really hard [in the last] few weeks with Magnus [Norman, his coach]. 'Even if the result wasn't there in Basel and Paris, I was feeling the ball really well on the practice court.' The good news for Czech fans is that Berdych has always gone on to win his second match at the ATP World Tour Finals, but the world No 7 will have to drastically improve in his next match on Wednesday if he is to continue that particular streak. Berdych said: 'Unfortunately it was my worst match of the season and I kept it for the start here in the World Tour Finals.'","Stanislas Wawrinka of Switzerland beat Czech Tomas Berdych 6-1, 6-1 to go top of Group A .

"Southampton are flying high in the Barclays Premier League, second only to the mighty Chelsea with 11 games played, but it hasn't always been that way. Here, Sportsmail's Alex Kirby charts his memories of a slightly different Saints team - one which resorted to selling cheap tickets to students in a bid to fill St Mary's Stadium in League One... It is Saturday, December 11, 2010 and I’m in Southampton, spending the last scraps of my student loan on snakebites, settling in to watching a day of Premier League football on the TV in a not particularly nice, but warm pub. In stroll a couple of friends, they each have scores of tickets for a Southampton match happening that afternoon, just down the road at St. Mary’s. They're tasked with flogging them to their fellow students at discounted rates. Jason Puncheon holds off Oldham's Paul Black during a League One clash at St Mary's Stadium back in 2010 . Rickie Lambert, now of Liverpool and England, in action for the South Coast club more than four years ago . It wasn’t exactly a glamour tie - a League One scrap between Southampton and Brentford - but such was the desperation to fill the stands, tickets were going on sale to students for as little as £3. Bargain! So, me and a few friends wobbled our way to St Mary’s and sat ourselves down for what seemed like a first half that lasted for all of eternity. The atmosphere was non-existent. Murmurs of despondency and roars of frustration poured from the crowd which was at least 10,000 shy of capacity. Shane Long scores the opening goal as he curls his left-footed shot past Leicester keeper Kasper Schmeichel . Republic of Ireland international Long scored a double in Southampton's 2-0 win over Leicester on Saturday . There was a full house at the St Mary's Stadium for the visit of last year's Championship winners Leicester . We watched on as Southampton played football only comparable in lack of quality to my Primark hoody, one of the few things that cost less than my ticket. By half-time, Brentford were 2-0 up. Freezing cold, bored rigid and surrounded by disillusioned Saints fans, me and my mates looked at each other, sheepishly rose from our seats and bumbled back to the relative safety and comfort of the nearby pub. On the short walk, I remember thinking to myself, ""there’s no way I’m paying £3 to watch that s***e again!"". It’s hard to believe that just four years on, the same club are riding high, second in the Barclays Premier League and battling away for a place in Europe. They’re not only filling the stands at St. Mary’s but pleasing the crowd with emphatic victories and a brand of football that’s being recognised – and very much enjoyed – by the masses.","Southampton are second in the Premier League after 11 matches .

"Mentally-ill: Derek Ward, 35, decapitated his 66-year-old mother, Patricia, on Tuesday before dragging her body into the street, in Farmingdale, New York, and kicking her head . This is the son who beheaded his mother and kicked her head along the street before jumping under a train in New York. Mentally-ill Derek Ward, 35, decapitated his 66-year-old mother, Patricia, on Tuesday night before dragging her body outside their apartment in Farmingdale, New York, in what neighbours thought at first was a Halloween prank. It was claimed today Prof. Ward was two days away from an appointment to get Derek the medication he had been without for four days, that could have saved her life. 'She had an appointment set up for (Friday),' her brother, the Rev. Robert Lubrano, told the New York Daily News. 'She finally met a compassionate psychiatrist, but she'll never make it to see him.' Describing Derek as a 'sick, sick boy', Rev. Lubrano said Derek had battled psychiatric issues for ten years, but had never shown any signs of violence. He said: 'He killed my sister because we couldn't get the prescriptions he needed. For four days, he didn't have his meds. 'She's dead because he had a mental illness, and we didn't know how serious it was. We're in terrible shock. She was a wonderful person.' Derek had apparently sat with his mother's mutilated body for a few minutes inside their blood-spattered home following the brutal attack before taking it outside and kicking her head 20 feet. Neighbours initially thought it was part of a Halloween prank and tried to pick up the body. As they were doing so, Derek jumped in front of an oncoming Long Island Rail Road (LIRR) train. Rev. Lubrano told the paper Derek, who had attention deficit disorder and was dyslexic, was too old to be covered by his mother's insurance and they struggled to find a doctor who would accept Medicaid. But he said they finally found one at a cost of $200 for a 20 minute visit, adding that his sister did 'everything she could to keep him alive'. WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT .

The campus is a very sad place today.' Derek was found to be carrying a pistol and 100 valiums when he died. Prof Ward was believed to have suffered multiple stab wounds and broken ribs before she died. She was an assistant professor of language arts at the Long Island Educational Opportunity Center  where she worked with high school students who need help to become prepared for college, Mr Calabria added. The victim was a woman in her 60s, authorities said on Tuesday. The suspect allegedly killed himself by jumping in front of a train soon after the brutal killing .

"A faithful dog has refused to leave the side of his dead master's grave for six years, it was reported today. German shepherd Capitan ran away from home after the death of Argentinian Miguel Guzman in 2006. A week later Mr Guzman's family went to pay their respects and found the heartbroken pet sitting by his owner's grave, wailing. Loyal: Capitan has not left the side of Miguel Guzman's grave since 2006 - and sleeps on top of it every night . Since then the grieving dog has rarely left the spot at the cemetery in the town of Villa Carlos Paz, central Argentina. Mr Guzman bought Capitan as a present for his 13-year-old son Damian in 2005. He died suddenly in March the next year, but by the time his family had returned home from the funeral Capitan was gone. Mr Guzman's widow Veronica told Argentina's Cordoba newspaper: 'We searched for him but he had vanished. We thought he must have got run over and died. 'The following Sunday we went to the cemetery and Damian recognised his pet. Capitan came up to us, barking and wailing, as if he were crying.' His Masters Grave: The German Shepherd ran away from the family home shortly after Mr Guzman's funeral and miraculously found his resting place . She added: 'We had never taken him to the cemetery so it is a mystery how he managed to find the place. 'We went back the next Sunday, and he was there again. This time, he followed us home and spent a bit of time with us, but then went back to the cemetery before it started getting dark. 'I don't think he wanted to leave Miguel on his own at night.' Protector: Although it has been six years since Mr Guzman's death Capitan proves a faithful companion and guards his grave day and night . Here to stay: Mr Guzman's son Damian has tried to bring Capitan home but he always runs back to the cemetary in Villa Carlos Paz . The cemetery's director Hector Baccega remembers the day he first saw the dog. He said: 'He turned up here one day, all on his own, and started wandering all around the cemetery until he eventually found the tomb of his master. 'During the day he sometimes has a walk around the cemetery, but always rushes back to the grave. And every day, at six o'clock sharp, he lies down on top of the grave stays there all night.' Mr Baccega said staff at the cemetery are now feeding and taking care of Capitan.

"Radamel Falcao's long-term fitness has been plunged into further doubt after it emerged that the Manchester United striker has to pack his troublesome left knee in ice after every game. United insisted on a rigorous medical before signing Falcao from Monaco in a £6million loan on deadline day due to the cruciate ligament injury he suffered in a French Cup tie in January that ruled him out of last summer’s World Cup. The deal could rise to £52m if United decide to sign the Colombia striker permanently next year, but there are growing concerns at Old Trafford about committing to such a huge deal for a player who earns £280,000-a-week and has yet to prove his fitness. Radamel Falcao appeared to be icing up his knee (circled) in this picture posted after Man United beat Everton . Marcos Rojo, Antonio Valencia, Angel di Maria, Juan Mata and Ander Herrera alongside Colombian Falcao . Falcao's permanent move to Manchester United is in doubt after fears over his knee niggle . Matches: 5 . Starts: 3 . Completed matches: 0 . Minutes played: 251 . Goals: 1 . Falcao’s new team-mates are understood to be surprised that he has to wrap his knee in an ice-pack after matches and training sessions to prevent any swelling, and questions have also been asked about his ability to return to peak condition after such a serious injury at the age of 28. The Colombia star has made just three starts for United and two more appearances off the bench, scoring just once in the win over Everton at Old Trafford last month. Falcao posted the picture above on Instagram after the Toffees match and it appears to show him with a pack on his knee under the towel. He has missed the last three games against Chelsea, Manchester City and Crystal Palace due to a calf injury picked up in training, with manager Louis van Gaal said to be harbouring doubts that he is physically up to the challenge of playing regularly in the Premier League. But it is his left knee that is more of a long-term concern after Falcao admitted before his United debut in September that he had feared he might not play again. The former Porto and Atletico Madrid striker came off the bench on his last appearance at West Brom and Van Gaal warned last week that Falcao is not guaranteed a starting place when he returns from injury after United switched to a one-striker system. Falcao (pictured at Manchester City) has only played two games in the last six weeks for Man United . ‘I cannot judge him now because now he is injured,’ said the United boss. ‘I cannot say when he will be back. It depends on the progress on his (calf) injury. ‘I changed him (left him out against West Brom) not because of his performance but because the balance of the team, and the team is more important than the individual. ‘I have to decide which striker. It is not his fault with the other system I could play with two strikers but then the balance wasn't good. We had difficulties in the last half an hour. ‘That is why I have remodelled the structure. Since then we have less goals in our favour but also less goal conceded and we have played against the better teams in the Premier League in that time on an equal level more or less.’ Sportsmail have approached Manchester United for comment. Falcao's only goal for the club came against Roberto Martinez's Everton at the beginning of October .","Radamel Falcao signed for Manchester United on loan on deadline day .

"Home Secretary Theresa May wants to make terror suspects 'stateless' by removing their UK citizenship . Terror suspects would be stripped of their British citizenship and made ‘stateless’ under plans drawn up by Theresa May. The Home Secretary wants to find a way around international rules which mean someone cannot be left without citizenship of any country. The move comes as she faces fresh pressure over the disappearance of suspects placed under terrorism prevention and investigation measures (Tpims). Fugitive Mohammed Ahmed Mohamed, who was subject to a TPIM, was last seen fleeing a London mosque in a burka 10 days ago. Labour’s Yvette Cooper has written to Mrs May urging her to re-introduce powers previously available under control orders, to forcibly move a suspect across the country. Mohamed was relocated to Ipswich, in Suffolk, when he was subject to a control order but returned to London when the restriction was lifted. Another Tpim subject and abscondee Ibrahim Magag who vanished in a black cab on Boxing Day last year but had been forced to live in the West Country. However, as part of wider reforms Mrs May reportedly wants to be able to remove terror suspects from Britain altogether by removing their British citizenship. At least 20 terror suspects have had their British passports torn up on national security grounds to stop them entering the country, it emerged today. In the two years to February this year, Mrs May stripped British citizenship from 16 individuals who had dual nationality considered to pose a threat to the UK. Rules in place for a decade allow ministers to act to revoke passports in a bid to target the so-called ‘enemy within’. Terror suspect Mohammed Ahmed Mohamed is being hunted by counter-terrorism police after leaving a London mosque in a burka . At least five of the 16 to lose their citizenship under the coalition were born in Britain.  One man had lived in the UK for five decades. The Home Office said: 'The government will take all necessary steps to protect the public, including pursuing deprivation of citizenship, where appropriate.' Mrs May wants the power to take a UK passport from anybody whose conduct is seriously prejudicial to the interests of the UK, sources said. Warning: Labour's Yvette Cooper has called for a return to rule which mean terror suspects can be sent to different parts of the UK . But Labour’s shadow immigration minister . David Hanson said: ‘Theresa May needs to concentrate on stopping people . absconding in taxis instead we get suggested changes that could take . years, will undoubtedly be legally questioned and won't help with the 6 . terror suspects being allowed off TPIMs in 2 months time because she . insisted on having an arbitrary time limit. ‘It isn't these smokescreens we need from the Home Secretary its rapid action to plug the gaps in her own terror control regime.’ It has been reported that ministers are reviewing Tpims and are considering whether to prohibit suspects from visiting mosques suspected of preaching hardline religious views. It is also understood Tpims could be tweaked to allow suspects to be relocated to parts of their home cities away from where known associates live . Shadow home secretary Ms Cooper said in a letter to Mrs May: ‘No terror suspect under a relocation order ever managed to abscond. ‘Now two terror suspects who were previously relocated and then returned because of your decision have absconded. ‘Your decision, against advice and warnings, to end relocations has made it much easier for two dangerous men to disappear.’ Ms Cooper asks the Home Secretary to agree to re-introduce the power to relocate terror suspects and pledges ‘cross party’ support.","Home Secretary wants to end rules which mean someone cannot be left without citizenship .

"Taco Bell has recently launched their new breakfast menu in the U.S. but its president has promised that it will soon also come to Canada - on one condition. Fast food chain President Brian Niccol said Taco Bell would introduce breakfast in Canada if they 'take Justin Bieber back'. The brilliant stipulation came as a response to a Canadian Taco Bell fan during an Ask Me Anything session on website Reddit. Trade me for a taco?: The President of Taco Bell joked that their new breakfast menu would be introduced in Canada if they take back teen singer Justin Bieber . Coming to Canada - on one condition: Taco Bell hopes to compete with McDonald's in the fast-food breakfast market, which the burger chain has dominated . Mr Niccol, who took to the social networking site in conjunction with Taco Bell's introduction of their breakfast menu also revealed that sales in Colorado has increased with 420 per cent since marijuana was legalised in the U.S. state. The long anticipated breakfast menu features novelties like a waffle taco, and unsurprisingly, Canadian Taco Bell customers wants in. Redditor user bordss posted 'Only to America? When is this coming to Canada?' Mr Niccol's response was simple: 'When you take Justin Bieber back'. The Taco Bell president's partaking in the Reddit AMA is just the latest move in the fast food chain's outreach to promote their new menu. Earlier this week, Taco Bell begun airing ads Thursday that feature everyday men who happen to have the same name as their main competitor McDonald's mascot - Ronald McDonald.

"The former head of children's services at the council which failed to save Baby P from being tortured to death has claimed she was a 'victim' of the scandal. Sharon Shoesmith defended Haringey Council despite its abject failure to prevent the death of the 17-month old, who was killed in August 2007 by his mother's sadistic boyfriend and his paedophile brother. But last night Mrs Shoesmith claimed she was a 'victim' of the case. She said: 'Peter was a victim of male child homicide, but you know we have all been victims in this.' Scroll down for video . Former head of children's services at Haringey Council Sharon Shoesmith told Newsnight last night that she has not worked since 2008 despite applying for hundreds of jobs . Asked by Newsnight presenter Evan Davies if she was a 'victim', Mrs Shoesmith responded: 'Peter was a victim of male child homicide, but you know we have all been victims in this' Appearing on BBC's Newsnight she revealed she had not worked since 2008, despite applying for 'several hundred jobs'. She said: 'You can't simply sack people. I think there needs to be an honest process. The real issue here is about familial child homicide.' Last year it emerged Mrs Shoesmith was awarded nearly £680,000 for unfair dismissal after Ed Balls sacked her in December 2008 during the height of public outrage over the killing. Mrs Shoesmith attacked the way she was sacked. She said: 'When you have public accountability and harm to children then the result is explosive. You can't be accountable to a public that have been told lies. 'You can't have these kneejerk reactions. You have got to have some sort of process.' Baby P, whose real name was Peter Connelly, was just 17 months old in 2007 when he was found dead in his blood-spattered cot at his mother's flat in Tottenham, north London, after suffering 50 separate injuries, including a broken back. Baby P's mother Tracey Connelly (left) was jailed for failing to protect her child from her abusive boyfriend and his brother . Jason Owen (left) and his brother Steven Barker (right) tortured to death Baby Peter Connelly in 2007 . His mother Tracey Connelly, who was jailed in 2009 for allowing her son Peter to be tortured to death by her boyfriend Steven Barker and his brother Jason Owen. Connelly was released from County Durham's Low Newton jail at the end of October. Probation officers ruled though the woman was still a danger to children, she is no longer a danger to the public. The case provoked a national scandal after it emerged that social workers, police and doctors missed a series of warning signs that could have saved the child's life. Baby Peter had been seen by a string of social workers, police and health professionals, but they failed to take him into care. He had been on the 'at risk' register for months when he died. Connelly's boyfriend  was a sadistic neo-Nazi who raped a two-year-old girl, tortured his own grandmother and is suspected of sex attacks on other children. His brother was a crack cocaine addict and convicted arsonist who was accused of raping a girl of 11. In the wake of his death, Ofsted published a damning report which exposed deep failings in Mrs Shoesmith's department. Haringey council also failed to save tragic eight-year-old Victoria Climbie who was killed in 2000 after being beaten, burned and tortured by her great aunt. Marie Therese Kouao and her boyfriend Carl Manning claimed she was possessed and were found guilty of her murder in 2001. Mrs Shoesmith was awarded compensation after Ed Balls - pictured for a recent documentary 'Baby P: The Untold Story - sacked her at the height of the crisis when he was the Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families . During her Newsnight interview, broadcast last night, she admitted that the number of mistakes made had been 'breathtaking when you look at it all together', but refused to describe the failures as 'serious'. 'It depends how you're going to define serious. What is a serious failure?' she asked. 'I believe I took responsibility and I believe that I was entirely accountable to my role.' Haringey Council's failure to investigate his mother's lies meant Peter and eight other children were left inside their squalid home in North London. Peter and his three sisters were sharing the four-bedroom house with their mother, her boyfriend Barker, his paedophile brother Owen and his four children, plus Owen's 15-year-old girlfriend. Three of the children - Peter and two of his siblings - were on Haringey's Child Protection Register because of fears they were being neglected by their mother. Social workers, health visitors and doctors saw the family 60 times before 17-month-old Peter died from his horrific injuries, which included a snapped spine and eight broken ribs. But none of these professionals realised that two men were living in the house, despite a family support official meeting 6ft 4in Barker during a home visit. The most basic check into their backgrounds would have revealed that Barker had been prosecuted by the RSPCA for abusing animals, and that he and his brother were investigated for torturing their own grandmother. Owen, who changed his name after a family row, has a string of convictions for burglaries, arson and assault, and was accused of raping an 11-year-old when he was only 13. Barker and Owen were both convicted of causing or allowing Peter's death after he was found dead in 2007. Barker was given 12 years while Owen was handed an indeterminate sentence but told he would be eligible for parole in three years. Connelly admitted allowing her son's death and was also given an indeterminate sentence. Her five-year minimum tariff means she would be eligible for release in 2012. At a subsequent trial in April, Barker was given a life sentence for the rape of the two-year-old, with a 20-year minimum.","Shoesmith was head of children's services at Haringey when Baby P died .

"It was a striking image of fishing boat sheds with Lindisfarne Castle in the background and was heralded as the best landscape photograph among hundreds of entries in a top competition. But now the photographer who won the prestigious prize has been stripped of his title and the £10,000 prize money - because of his use of Photoshop. David Byrne, 43, from Cannock, Staffordshire, won the Take a View Landscape Photographer of the Year award last month as it was a 'clear favourite' of the judges who agreed it best captured an aspect of the UK landscape. A photographer showed how the position of the clouds and the light in David Byrne's winning photograph of Lindisfarne Castle was physically impossible because the sun would have to be in two different places at once. The red lines in the image point to two different points in the sky where the sun would be positioned if the shadows and light were correct . Striking: David Byrne's picture of upturned boats on the coast of Lindisfarne, Northumberland, England, was doctored to include clouds in the sky to make it look darker and gloomy . David's father's photograph of the same landscape, also doctored, was taken nine minutes later and the light is shown to be different . However after winning the prize, Mr . Byrne said he was subject to a 'witch-hunt' for adding clouds in the sky, leading to his . disqualification for employing excessive digital manipulation in his . winning entry. Two other photographers turned . detective and highlighted in their own blogs how the photograph was . realistically impossible and days later Mr Byrne was pulled from the . competition. Mr Byrne told MailOnline that he had . removed some moored boats in the middle of the harbour and doctored the . sky to make it look dark and gloomy by adding a few clouds. He said: ‘I added clouds because the sky was a . bit boring. Unfortunately, while I don’t . feel like I have done anything wrong, I didn’t read the regulations and . it does say that replacing the sky is not allowed. ‘The purists out there were not . happy. Messing about with pictures has been done for over 100 years. I . treat my photography as art and I try to make the best looking picture.' After winning the prize in October, . two landscape photographers posted blogs on the internet explaining . through a sequence of images why Mr Byrne's photograph could not be . real. One of the photographers, Tim Parkin, . who entered the competition the previous year, highlighted through a . series of red lines how the varying lights and shadows in the photograph . were realistically impossible. For the shadows on fishing boat sheds . and the light from the sky to be correct, the sun would have had to . have been in two different places at once - highlighted by where the red . arrows point to. While the red lines on the shadow on . the sheds point to the correct position of the sun, the arrows on the . other image point to a position in the sky where the sun would not have . been at that time of day, according to Mr Parkin. Atmospheric: David Baker's misty view of pines in the New Forest, Hampshire, England, won the 'Your View' category . Ambiance: Delamere Forest, Cheshire, England, the Classic View winner in the Take a View Landscape Photographer of the Year award . Mr Byrne, who has only been taking . landscape photographs for two years, said since winning the competition . he had received abusive emails from other photographers. He said: 'To me I feel like I have been hounded for days, it has been quite unsettling. 'I can’t blame Take A View, the witch hunt was not going to stop anyway. ‘I felt like I was being investigated by the FBI.' He said some of evidence used against . him was a picture that his father took nine minutes after him on the . same day - which showed the clouds in a different position in the sky. His father, Philip, told MailOnline: . 'It is quite accepted and desirable to add another sky to enhance the . characteristics and remove ugly modern day rubbish and graffiti etc, . after all this is art. 'Thousands and thousands of . photographers in camera clubs do this all the time, it is accepted by . the world ruling body F.I.A.P. as long as composite images are the work . of the photographer.' The contest's organisers, Take a . View, said Mr Byrne’s photograph was assessed in 'good faith' and was . the 'clear favourite' of the judges.

Charlie Waite, founder of the . competition said: 'This is extremely regrettable and it appears there . was no deliberate intention to deceive the judges but the level of . manipulation means that this photograph gained an unfair advantage in . this category and in winning the overall competition. 'The integrity of the competition is . very important to all involved and it was clear that disqualification . was the only course of action open to us.'

"Arsenal are considering a £7million swoop for Celtic defender Virgil van Dijk in an attempt to solve their defensive headache. Speaking at Thursday's Annual General Meeting, manager Arsene Wenger confirmed he will look to sign a central defender in January. And Van Dijk is emerging as a prime contender amongst the Gunners hierarchy. Virjil van Dijk could be on his way for Arsenal for £7million... the Gunners failed to sign him in the summer . Arsene Wenger is looking for defensive cover and admitted he will sign one player in January . Groningen (2010-2013) Games 62 Goals 7 . Celtic (2013-present) Games 42 Goals 5 . Arsenal looked into the prospect of signing Van Dijk, 23, on transfer deadline day but couldn't get a deal over the line. But the Gunners are set to revive their interest in January as they look to bolster their defensive options Arsenal have nine first-team players unavailable for tomorrow's clash against Hull City. Wenger's biggest concern is in defence, with Laurent Koscielny (Achilles), Mathieu Debuchy (ankle) and Calum Chambers (suspended) all unavailable for the repeat of last year's FA Cup final. Koscielny's long-term fitness is major concern. The Achilles injury is a long-standing problem, which has deteriorated in recent weeks. 'It has got worse, he finds it difficult to play with at the moment,' said Wenger, who insisted France international does not require surgery. 'If you wait for it to be better, it can be a short time. If you want to get rid of it completely, it is long term. 'We will monitor him and as soon as he can take enough pain again he will play.' Laurent Koscielny will be out of the game against Hull this weekend with a mysterious achilles problem . Young defender Calum Chambers is unavailable for the game against Hull due to a suspension . The fear is Koscielny's injury could manifest itself into a problem that could see him miss months rather than weeks, leaving Wenger with the dilemma of whether to hand Koscielny an extended break in hope that the Achilles does not become a serious hinderance or continue playing the Frenchman and risk aggravating the injury further. Koscielny's absence means Wenger is almost certain to use left-back Nacho Monreal as a makeshift central defender alongside Per Mertesacker against Hull in a back-four that could also consist of rookie right-back Hector Bellerin and Kieran Gibbs.

"A top grammar school was forced to apologise after a group of pupils 'blacked up' for a fancy dress party held as part of a leavers' day celebration.

"Steven Gerrard has admitted he may one day regret not ‘challenging’ himself by accepting an offer to join Real Madrid. But as he prepares to lead Liverpool into a blockbuster clash against the European champions, Gerrard insists he would have regretted it even more had he turned his back on his boyhood club. The 34-year-old was courted by Madrid in 2010 at the start of the summer that saw Jose Mourinho appointed Real manager but Gerrard stayed loyal to Liverpool. Steven Gerrard says he had opportunities to join Real Madrid over his career . He said: ‘It is very flattering to be linked to a huge club like Real Madrid. I’ve had a couple of options throughout my career to go to Real Madrid but I resisted temptation, because of the big connection I have to my hometown club. ‘It may be something I regret down the line, for not challenging myself and having a change of scenery in a different country, but I would have had an even bigger regret if I’d left the club I love. ‘I’m a big fan of Real Madrid. They are a special club. But Liverpool is my No 1 club.’ This will be only the fourth meeting between Liverpool and Real, and the Reds have an unblemished record, with victories coming in the 1981 European Cup final and the Champions League last-16 tie in 2009 — a 5-0 demolition. Gerrard scored twice when Liverpool beat Madrid 4-0 in the second leg at Anfield five years ago. That night is recalled with great fondness by Liverpool supporters and manager Brendan Rodgers has urged his players to make themselves legends by recording another victory. Gerrard and Rodgers spoke to the press ahead of Liverpool's clash with Real Madrid . Brendan Rodgers is preparing Liverpool for the test of Real Madrid on Wednesday . ‘These are the types of games that are talked about for years and years,’ said Rodgers. ‘Stevie’s two goals in the last game against them are still talked about. The performances are in the big games and if you make a big contribution that is what the supporters remember. ‘We are going into the game after being up and down but underpinning all the great performances last season was the spirit and character in the group and that will serve them well. ‘They can go into the game to get a result for the team. What can come from that is a legendary status.’ Madrid are odds-on favourites to win but former Liverpool defender Alvaro Arbeloa insisted there would be no complacency as ‘even if Liverpool had lost 10-0 at the weekend’ Carlo Ancelotti’s squad would still be worried. Gerrard does not believe that Real Madrid will come to  Anfield with any fear . ‘We know what they can do in Europe,’ said Arbeloa. Rodgers, whose side are on the back foot after losing to Basle in their last group match, wants games such as tonight’s to be the norm. ‘If we didn’t come out of the group we would be bitterly disappointed,’ said Rodgers. ‘But in order for us to be there we have to ensure that our league form keeps us in the top four. It’s a competition that I, as a coach and a manager, want us to be in for a long, long time.’ Gerrard says Cristiano Ronaldo has moved up a level since moving to Real Madrid .

"A town's new brightly-coloured paving slabs could give pedestrians epileptic fits and confuse people with dementia, it was claimed today. The controversial pavement in Grimsby, Lincolnshire, is now being condemned as hazardous to health and safety because of the pattern and colours of the brick. According to locals, the 'hypnotising' patterns of the brick are also being blamed for an increased number of . falls on the street. Crazy paving: Angry pedestrians in Grimsby are claiming that their lives are being put at risk - by a new coloured pavement . North East Lincolnshire's council leader Chris Shaw has denied there is an issue, adding the council had contacted the Epilepsy Society for advice before going ahead with the scheme. Councillor Steve Beasant believes the pattern could trigger epileptic fits for those with photosensitive epilepsy, a fact he had pointed out to the council before the blocks were laid. Councillor Beasent, who suffers from epilepsy, said: 'It is a risk to anyone who suffers with photosensitive epilepsy. It's not just strobe lights that can trigger seizures; patterns and shapes can cause it. 'People who suffer from migraine have told me it can trigger one and even those with no health conditions have told me that walking on the paving makes them feel nauseous. 'I don't want to be alarmist, but NELC should have consulted with the Falls Collaborative. No one consulted with them before they were laid. That's my major concern. 'I'm concerned that, as a result, the right materials were not put down. They look nice. They look great, but we should have taken advice.' The controversial block paving is being condemned as hazardous to health and likely to cause epileptic seizures because of the pattern and colours of the brick . Reports from carers of those with dementia also claim that many sufferers perceive the black blocks among other coloured bricks as holes, which they then try to avoid, risking injury in the process. A spokesman for North East Lincolnshire Falls Collaborative said the group had 'real areas of concern' about the potential risks to the disabled and those with dementia and other conditions. The concerns are the latest in a long line of complaints about the blocks, which have already come under fire from businesses, residents and taxi drivers, many of whom have branded it a 'waste of money'. Sylvia Leary said a risk assessment she had carried out in the area had revealed a lack of drop-kerbs, making the area difficult to navigate for the disabled. The hope facilitator said she was 'disappointed' NELC had not consulted the Falls Collaborative before laying the new multi-coloured paving, especially as it had previously regularly sought advice from the group on highways issues. Mrs Leary said: 'NELC is probably doing it to make Freeman Street look prettier, and it is a big improvement there, but there are some areas which are quite disappointing. There are lessons to be learned from this.' Marathon runner Surinder Fowler said: 'I run up and down there every day, but the new black and white paths have made it really difficult and I've fallen over twice. 'I now use the back roads and I avoid Freeman Street altogether. I think it was a very bad idea, you can't focus when you're jogging and it makes you feel funny in your head.' Grimsby MP Austin Mitchell, who said he was 'saddened' to hear there were issues with the paving, but that 'something needs to be done'. Austin said: 'I thought the paving was pretty attractive, but it is a real concern if it is affecting people with epilepsy and other health problems. 'I don't know what can be done. Maybe the pattern could be altered? Clearly, they must do something.'","Controversial paving in Grimsby, Lincs, is being condemned as hazardous .

"The stars of a new BBC documentary People Like Us have accused the programme makers of making them look 'fat, drunk and destitute'. The six-part BBC Three series follows a versatile selection of residents living in Harpurhey, Manchester - which was named the most deprived neighbourhood in Britain ten years ago. But the locals featured in the documentary believe they have been made to look like 'Jeremy Kyle Show-type chavs' - a talk show well known for its outbursts of swearing and violence from guests and its frequent paternity tests. Angry: Residents in Harpurhey, Manchester, have accused TV producers of making them look like 'chavs' who live in a 'slum' in a new documentary on BBC Three . Reality TV: The BBC Three Documentary called People Like Us follows several residents in the town - which was once labelled the most deprived neighbourhood in Britain . They have also criticised producers for making their home town look 'like a slum'. More than 300 residents attended a public meeting last night to voice their outage at the People Like Us programme, The Daily Star reports. They claim they were tricked into taking part and believed the programme would show how the area had improved. Council worker Richard Searle alleged that his daughter Rosie, 21, was given alcohol before the cameras were turned on. Mr Searle commented: 'This Jeremy Kyle-style, laugh-at-the-chavs type of television has run its course and the BBC should not be propagating this harmful and misleading image of the working class.' Another resident Toni Callan, 26, whose footage was not used in the documentary, told . the newspaper that the film crew bought her and her friends shots of . alcohol and encouraged them to fight because 'it would make good TV'. 'Misleading': Residents claim People Like Us made people in the documentary look 'like chavs on Jeremy Kyle' - a show known for its outbursts of swearing and violence from its guests . She added: 'They've manufactured the whole documentary.' Campaigners are threatening to perform a demonstration outside BBC's Media City in Salford if the show isn't cancelled. The third episode of the show was aired last night and residents have called for the remaining three shows to be axed. Local Labour MP Graham Stringer plans to write to BBC Trust chairman Lord Patten to ask for an explanation. A BBC spokesman said: 'We are listening to the range of . feedback from the local area and contributors, many of whom have been . positive. 'People Like Us takes a warm and at times unflinching look at . the reality of life for young people in Harpurhey and follows a range of . contributors as they tell their own stories in their own words through . both good times and bad. On camera: Amber Wakefield, 18, whose family runs the local launderette in Harpurhey, Manchester, is one of many local residents to feature on the show . 'The series does not focus on negative . stereotypes, indeed many of those featured are resilient, resourceful . and ambitious young people with positive stories to tell – from running . their own businesses to planning their future careers – and they do so . with captivating wit and enthusiasm.' The production company Dragonfly said no one was ever encouraged to fight during the making of the show. A spokesman said: 'Before the series was commissioned, we met with a huge variety of potential contributors, providing reasonable hospitality on occasion. 'Not everyone we met during the research stage was chosen for inclusion in the final series and Toni Callan does not feature in any of the episodes. 'No one was encouraged to fight and we adhered to the BBC's Editorial Guidelines at all times.'

"Royal Mail were blasted today after they banned deliveries to more than 100 residents on a street following health and safety fears - over wonky paving slabs. Residents on the Victorian estate in Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, are now forced to make a four-mile round trip collect their letters and parcels from a central depot. Royal Mail postmen are refusing to deliver to The Villas after it became a no-go zone due to 'a number of incidents involving colleagues falling and slipping'. Resident Catherine Burgass said the move by Royal Mail has 'annoyed' all of the residents at The Villas . Yesterday home-owners on the road, which is not council-maintained as it is privately run by the residents' association, said their mail had been delivered without a problem for 150 years and slammed Royal Mail for not giving them any warning. The estate's residents' association has asked Royal Mail to identify which areas need repairing but say it would cost tens of thousands of pounds to tarmac the entire stretch. Elderly resident Alfred Poole, 79, branded the move 'barmy'. He said: 'Its health and safety gone mad. I'm an old man and if I can manage the paving slabs, I'm sure the postman can. 'I haven't got a car and I can't walk four miles to fetch my post. It's just ridiculous.' Royal Mail say they suspended deliveries to the street for health and safety reasons following 'incidents' Julian Wilshaw, 38, who lives with his partner Sarah and daughter Jessica, added: 'It came out of the blue. 'We had heard nothing at all about it and then the letter came through. 'We weren't even warned or informed there was an issue, so we could maybe try to help put any issues right. 'Royal Mail deliver to the likes of the Isle of Skye and the Hebrides - we're just The Villas, in Stoke. 'My daughter has hip problems and we're waiting on a letter from the hospital. 'I have sympathy for the postmen if they've hurt themselves, but we don't know what the problem is, and Royal Mail have been delivering to us for years. 'It's a massive inconvenience for all the residents, especially the more elderly people living here.' A total of 40 households and over 100 residents have been affected by the ban. Ms Burgass said the pavement has been in the same condition since she moved in 15 years ago . Martin Parker, 52, secretary of The Villas Residents' Association, said: 'The letter said one postman had injured themselves a month ago, and we were told it happened again a couple of days before the letter was sent. 'No-one had been consulted about any problems with the state of the pavements and I'm surprised they hadn't bothered to consult with us. 'It would have been sensible for them to speak to us, and it's bizarre Royal Mail has taken this rather extreme stance. 'The road is not slippery, our bins are emptied and post had been delivered here for a very long time. 'Luckily, I have a car and I'm physically fit, but there are quite a few elderly residents and there's the care home here too. 'Also, no-one seems to be able to contact the phone number attached with the letter.' Doug Burnham, 49, who has lived on The Villas for 15 years, added: 'It's a very difficult situation. I can't see how our neighbourhood differs from any other neighbourhood. Residents have slammed Royal Mail for not giving them any warning about the cancellation of the service . 'Sweeping and cleaning is something we do as often as possible. We also tackle things like potholes, drainage issues and fly-tipping. 'We are open to discussions. 'We would be willing to pay if there were particularly problematic areas and we do that anyway, but obviously we couldn't do the entirety of the paving.' Resident Catherine Burgass, 47, added: 'I was extremely surprised we had not had any prior warning. 'The pavement has been in the same condition since I moved in 15 years ago. 'Everybody's annoyed about it.' A Royal Mail spokesperson said: 'We have taken the decision to suspend deliveries to a small number of addresses after a number of incidents involving colleagues falling and slipping. 'Our priority is the safety of our people and we apologise to customers.'","Royal Mail say they have suspended deliveries after 'a number of incidents' which saw delivery drivers fall and slip on the private Victorian road .

"The nation's largest private prison company is being held in contempt of court by a federal judge for chronic understaffing at an Idaho prison. U.S. District Judge David Carter made the ruling against the Nashville, Tenn.-based Corrections Corporation of America in a scathing 24-page ruling issued on Monday. In it, Carter took the company to task for lying about staffing levels and warned that he would make the fines as big as needed to force CCA's compliance with a settlement agreement it reached two years ago with Idaho inmates and the American Civil Liberties Union. 'If a prospective fine leads to $2.4 million in penalties, CCA has no one to blame but itself,' Carter wrote. Prison south of Boise so understaffed and violent that prisoners called it 'Gladiator School' The contempt finding stems from a case that began in 2010 when the ACLU sued on behalf of inmates at the  ise, contending that the facility was so violent that prisoners called it 'Gladiator School' and that understaffing and mismanagement contributed to the problem. CCA denied the allegations, but reached a settlement agreement with the inmates, promising to increase staffing levels above what was then required under its $29 million contract with the Idaho Department of Correction. That settlement agreement was slated to expire this month, but the ACLU asked the judge to extend it and find CCA in contempt for failing to abide by the agreement. CCA acknowledged earlier this year that its employees filed reports with the state that falsely showed 4,800 hours of vacant security posts as being staffed during 2012. But during the contempt of court hearing earlier this month, witnesses revealed that number only included the night shift during a seven-month span. Judge David Carter makes ruling against Corrections Corporation of America . 'It is clear that the non-compliance was far worse than the report of about 4,800 hours would lead one to believe,' Carter wrote. 'There is also no reason to believe the problem only began in April 2012 and was solved after October 2012,' Carter added. 'Indeed, even in the weeks prior to the contempt hearings, mandatory posts were still going unfilled — thus there remains persistent staffing pressure that is the backdrop to prison employees fabricating records. 'The difference today is that CCA may finally be presenting an accurate picture of its inability to fully staff its prison.' From now on, any mandatory post left unstaffed for more than 12 hours in a month will bring fines of $100 an hour, Carter wrote. He warned that he would raise the fine to $500 an hour — or higher — if things don't change. The judge also rejected CCA's contention that the former warden and other company officials didn't know about the understaffing, saying that they had been warned of the staffing problems multiple times and at the very least failed to check it out. 'For CCA staff to lie on so basic a point — whether an officer is actually at a post — leaves the Court with serious concerns about compliance in other respects, such as whether every violent incident is reported,' Carter wrote. From now on, the court will get staffing reports from an independent monitor who will watch staffing levels at the prison and report directly to the federal courts, Carter said. He said he wouldn't make CCA do an audit to determine just how many hours have been understaffed in the last few years because the Idaho Department of Correction already has such an audit underway. The Idaho State Police are currently investigating whether CCA committed any crimes when it gave the false staffing reports to the Idaho Department of Corrections and when it failed to meet the minimum staffing requirements under its state contract. 'Further, IDOC has contractual remedies against CCA; it is up to that agency to determine what compensation it pursues for having been lied to,' Carter wrote. He also rejected CCA's 'no harm, no foul' claim that the understaffing didn't lead to increased violence or other problems. 'Having enough correctional officers can deter violence, but also it offers other benefits, such as having enough staff on the prison floor to accurately track the levels of violence in the first place,' he noted. CCA spokesman Steven Owen said in a prepared statement that the company was reviewing the ruling and considering next steps. 'We believe we are taking all appropriate steps to correct the staffing matter and are unaware of any new findings beyond what we've previously acknowledged. We are meeting the contractual staffing requirements and are working on an ongoing basis to ensure that continues,' Owen wrote. 'Our top priority is the safety of our staff, the inmates entrusted to our care and the communities where we operate, and we are committed to providing the state and Idaho's taxpayers with the highest quality corrections service.' ACLU attorney Stephen Pevar said in a prepared statement that the organization was thankful to the judge for carefully examining the evidence. 'It took great effort to uncover the truth,' Pevar wrote. 'ICC was missing thousands of hours of guards. What is particularly disturbing is that CCA failed to adequately staff ICC despite the obvious additional risk of assault that created for both prisoners and staff and the unnecessary stress and fear it generated.'","Nation's largest private prison company - Corrections Corporation of America - held in contempt of court .

"The U.S. official in charge of assessing the damage caused by the leaking of classified document by former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden said earlier this week that making a deal to grant Snowden amnesty in exchange for the documents he still has is something worth considering. Richard Ledgett, who was put in charge of the Snowden leak task-force by General Keith Alexander, was interviewed for an upcoming episode of 60 Minutes, and says that because of the damage Snowden could potentially do with the information he still has in his possession, cutting him a deal might be in the best interest of the country. 'So, my personal view is, yes, [granting Snowden amnesty] is worth having a conversation about,' Ledgett tells 60 Minutes corespondent John Miller. 'I would need assurances that the remainder of the data could be secured, and my bar for those assurances would be very high. It would be more than just an assertion on his part.' Richard Ledgett, who heads a task force assessing Snowden's leaks, says the U.S. should consider granting him amnesty . In all, Ledgett says Snowden is likely to still be in possession of more than 1.5 million classified documents as he waits in asylum in Russia. Ledgett's boss, General Alexander, doesn't share his belief that Snowden should be allowed to evade punishment for stealing the documents. 'This is analogous to a hostage-taker taking 50 people hostage, shooting 10 and then say, ""If you give me full amnesty, I'll let the other 40 go."" What do you do,' Alexander says. Meanwhile, the NSA has made dozens of changes in its operations and computer networks to prevent the emergence of another Snowden, including potential disciplinary action, a top NSA official said on Friday, as a White House review panel recommended restraints on NSA spying. In the more than hour-long interview with Reuters, Ledgett acknowledged the agency had done a poor job in its initial public response to revelations of vast NSA monitoring of phone and Internet data; pledged more transparency; and said he was deeply worried about highly classified documents not yet public that are among the 1.7 million Snowden is believed to have accessed. He also stoutly defended the NSA's mission of tracking terrorist plots and other threats, and said its recruiting of young codebreakers, linguists and computer geeks has not been affected by the Snowden affair - even as internal morale has been. 'Any time you trust people, there is always a chance that someone will betray you,' he said. Bargaining Chip: Authorities say Snowden still has 1.5 million classified documents in his possession . The NSA is taking 41 specific technical measures to control data by tagging and tracking it, to supervise agency networks with controls on activity, and to increase oversight of individuals. Measures include requiring two-person control of every place where someone could access data and enhancing the security process that people go through and requiring more frequent screenings of systems administrative access, Ledgett said. After months of sometimes blistering criticism in the news media and by Congress and foreign governments, the publicity-averse NSA is now mounting an effort to tell its side of the Snowden story. Ledgett, a 36-year intelligence veteran who reportedly is in line to be the agency's deputy director, joked that doing media interviews was 'a complete out-of-body experience for me.' He spoke to Reuters on the same day that the White House said it had decided to maintain the practice of having a single individual head both the NSA and U.S. Cyber Command, which conducts cyberwarfare - an outcome the NSA leadership favored. Separately, news reports late Thursday said an outside review panel appointed by the White House has recommended changes in a program disclosed by Snowden that collects basic data on Americans' phone calls - known as metadata. The panel reportedly said the data should be held by an organization other than the NSA and stricter rules should be enforced for searching the databanks. Asylum: Snowden remains in asylum in Russia, where he is in possession of more than 1.5 million classified documents . Ledgett declined to discuss the panel's specific recommendations. But he seemed to acknowledge that tighter guidelines for NSA eavesdropping were in the offing, saying that what is technologically possible ""has gotten ahead of policy."" Snowden, who is living under asylum in Russia, disclosed a vast U.S. eavesdropping apparatus that includes the phone metadata program; NSA querying of Internet communications via major companies such as Google Inc and Facebook Inc; and widespread tapping of international communication networks. Ledgett made no apologies for what many see as overly aggressive NSA monitoring. He noted that the U.S. government's intelligence taskings to the agency run to 36,000 pages, and said its activities take place within a 'box' of U.S. laws and policies.'We'll color in every square millimeter of that box,' he said, implying the NSA will use its legal authorities to the fullest extent possible. The NSA's internal review has determined about 98 percent of the scope of the material that Snowden had accessed, and officials have found no evidence that he had help either within the NSA or from adversary spy agencies. Ledgett said that when Snowden was downloading the documents, NSA was ahead of other intelligence agencies in installing ""insider threat"" software that President Barack Obama ordered in the wake of an earlier leak scandal involving the group WikiLeaks. But installation of the software, which might have stopped Snowden, was not complete. 'Snowden hit at a really opportune time. For him - not for us,' he said. Not Unanimous: General Keith Alexander doesn't agree that Snowden should be granted amnesty in exchange for documents . Ledgett said that most of the Snowden material released publicly so far has been about NSA programs and partnerships with foreign countries and companies, rather than intelligence reports and 'requirements.' The latter refers to U.S. government taskings to the NSA to answer questions about specific targets. That last category is what keeps him up at night. 'Those make me nervous because they reveal what we know and what we don't know and they are almost a roadmap for adversaries.' No one at the NSA has yet lost their job over the Snowden crisis, including at the Hawaii site where he worked. Ledgett said three people are under review for potential disciplinary action, but declined further comment. He challenged those who call Snowden a whistleblower, saying the former contractor did not use multiple channels available to vent his concerns. 'I actually think characterizing him as a whistleblower is a disservice to people who are whistleblowers.' Ledgett said he knew of no U.S. government move toward reaching any kind of a legal deal with Snowden, a decision that would be up to the Justice Department. But, he said in his opinion, such a conversation would have to include concrete assurances that Snowden would secure any of the material he has that has not yet been made public. In the aftermath of Snowden, the NSA is trying to be more open about what it does so the public can have more confidence in the agency's mission. 'We as an agency are a little naive, for a long time we were ''No Such Agency'' or ''no comment'' and were not adept at presenting our face to the public,' he said.'I think quite frankly had we done more of that over the last five or 10 years we might not be in the same place that we are vis-a-vis the public perception of who we are and what we do,' he said. 'So too late to learn that lesson, so what you are seeing now is our new face.'","Richard Ledgett says he would need assurances that the documents still in Snowden's possession could be secured .

"The Queen cut a fashionable figure on day one of Royal Ascot as she appeared in a fondant pink suit - joined by Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall, but without the Duke of Edinburgh. The monarch was pictured with a huge smile on her face in the Royal Box as one of the races took place - while Princess Eugenie appeared shocked and Prince Andrew had a face of concentration. The Queen also made her traditional appearance on the race track in an open landau carriage pulled by four grey horses, greeted by loud cheers from an adoring crowd of racegoers. But the bookies weren't smiling so much, having to pay out to punters who guessed the Queen would be wearing pink and those who guessed she would be wearing peach... because they couldn't decide what colour exactly her suit was. Concentration: Later in the afternoon the Queen was enthralled in a race as she watched from the Royal Box along with Princess Eugenie and Prince Andrew . The Queen couldn't help beaming as her horse appeared to come in first, but maybe Eugenie had betted on a different steed. Sophie, Countess of Wessex is seen right .

Gary Lineker's wife, Danielle, looked particularly beautiful in a stunning pale pink 1930s style frock teamed with a white picture hat, while Andy Murray's other half, Kim Sears, plumped for trademark prints teamed with a pair of delicate lemon shoes. In the paddock, a flock of beautifully dressed women in a array of stunning rainbow . hues were drawing admiring glances from male race goers, although the . odd shivering girl in a too-short skirt could also be seen. Hats were big and bold, with floral . motifs spotted . adorning headwear up and down the course. Racegoer Florence Claridge wore an . artificial pink fuchsia plant on her head complete with dozens of blooms . and a matching shocking pink dress. She said: 'You have to be a trooper to wear this, it's quite heavy - but I've been coming here for 25 years.'

Also looking good was Ruth Langsford, wife of veteran Sky News presenter, Eamonn Holmes, who looked radiant in a pretty lilac dress and cream picture hat. Nearby, Ascot's phalanx of dress code . enforcers - tasked with ensuring straps are at least 2.5 inches wide . and skirts are modest - watched beadily, while surveying passing guests. And not everyone made the cut. One unfortunate racegoer - a gentleman sporting a large floral headpiece - fell foul of the Royal Ascot fashion police and was sent home to change. Although today's races will not feature a thoroughbred from the Queen's own stables, her filly, Estimate, is one of the favourites for Thursday's Gold Cup -  a race the Queen would dearly love to win. In the foreword to the official programme, the Queen wrote: 'I was fortunate enough too own a winner at last year's royal meeting, so I know what a thrill it is to have success at this wonderful racecourse whether you are a trainer, jockey, or one of the many hard-working stable staff associated with every runner.' Also in the running for the Gold Cup is last year's winner, Colour Vision, and 2010 champion, Rites of Passage. Today's races include the Queen Anne Stakes, expected to be carried off by American horse, Animal Kingdom, followed by the King's Stand Stakes, which will see South African colt, Shea Shea, start the race in pole position with bookmakers.

"One of Franklin Delano Roosevelt's numerous rumored affairs will be revisited in the coming weeks with the release of 'Hyde Park on Hudson,' a film depicting the American president's quasi-incestual affair with his distant cousin, Margaret 'Daisy' Suckley. The film, opening December 7, stars Bill Murray as Roosevelt and Laura Linney as Miss Suckley. It takes place during the June 1939 weekend that the British king and queen visited Roosevelt at his upstate New York cottage in Hyde Park, where FDR was said to take a number of mistresses. FDR's affinity for the company of women was always well known and some historians dispute stories of his alleged affairs, saying his friendships never grew to become romances. Scroll down for video . One of many women: Franklin D. Roosevelt was said to have carried on a 20-year affair with his secretary, Marguerite 'Missy' LeHand. The pair is pictured in the Oval Office at the White House circa 1940 . The least disputed of Roosevelt's supposed affairs, however, was with Lucy Mercer, his wife's social secretary when he was assistant secretary of the Navy in 1916. The affair lasted two years, with one of his friends posing as Mercer's escort. Eleanor discovered the affair in in 1918 when she found love letters in her husband's suitcase. 'The bottom dropped out of my world,' she later said. 'I face myself, my surroundings, my world, honestly for the first time.' Mercer stayed in FDR's life until his death in 1945, and she was with him when he took his last breaths, even though she eventually married another man. Also by FDR's side when he died was Daisy Suckley, the president's sixth cousin and close confidant who is depicted in 'Hyde Park on the Hudson'. Lucy Mercer: The least disputed of Roosevelt's supposed affairs was with Lucy Mercer, his wife's social secretary when he was assistant secretary of the Navy in 1916. This photo is from Jan. 20, 1936 . Love nest: FDR took many of his close female friends whom he was rumored to be involved with romantically to his Hyde Park home in upsate New York. The home is now a tourist attraction . The extent of Suckley's close relationship with Roosevelt wasn't known until her death in 1991, when a stash of letters from Roosevelt was found under her bed. 'I have longed to have you with me,' he wrote in one letter from a cruise to Panama. Soon after his death, Suckley wrote in her diary: 'He told me once that there was no one else with whom he could be so completely honest.' She spent long periods of time at the White House with him during the war years and they often visited his cottage in Hyde Park. While the letters are suggestive, some historians say argue they do not provide hard evidence of a physical love affair. Lifelong 'friend:' Lucy Mercer, pictured in the 1930s, stayed in FDR's life until his death in 1945, and she was with him when he took his last breaths . Box office: One of FDR's numerous rumored affairs will be revisited with the Dec. 7 release of 'Hyde Park on Hudson,' a film depicting his quasi-incestual affair with his distant cousin, Margaret 'Daisy' Suckley . Another woman close to FDR was Princess Martha of Sweden, a royal who was forced to flee Scandinavia in 1941 after the Nazi invasion. Rumors of their affair spread like wildfire, as she always conveniently visited the White House and Hyde Park when Eleanor was out of town. The princess called Roosevelt by the nickname 'Dear Godfather,' and friends said they were very flirtatious towards one another. Another affair? Another woman close to FDR was Princess Martha of Sweden, a royal who was forced to flee Scandinavia in 1941 after the Nazi invasion . During the same time period, Roosevelt was said to be involved with Dorothy Schiff, a former publisher of the New York Post. Schiff's biographer, Jeffrey Potter, claimed in his 1976 book, 'Men, Money and Magic: The Story of Dorothy Schiff,' that she admitted to having an affair with FDR between 1936 and 1943. But when the book was published, she denied the affair, even though Potter claimed she had reviewed the manuscript and never asked to have that information retracted. Denial: Dorothy Schiff, a former publisher of the New York Post who is pictured in 1963, admitted to her biographer that she had an affair with Roosevelt, then later recanted, according to the biographer . Roosevelt's longest supposed affair was with his secretary, Missy LeHand, which some historians believe he became romantically involved with beginning in 1921, when he was serving as governor of New York. The affair lasted 20 years, according to some, and it was cataloged in a book written by FDR's son Elliott, who said the relationship was common knowledge. Gifts from Suckley: Franklin D. Roosevelt relaxes with his Scottish terrier, Fala at Hyde Park. Fala was a gift from Margaret Suckley and FDR took the dog with him everywhere . Gifts: Roosevelt left his secretary, Missy LeHand, half of his $3 million estate . Til' death do us part: A handful of Roosevelt's alleged mistresses were with him when he died . 'Everyone in the close-knit inner circle of father's friends accepted it as a matter of course,' he wrote. 'I remember being only mildly stirred to see him with Missy on his lap as he sat in his wicker chair in the main stateroom holding her in his sun-browned arms ... He made no attempt to conceal his feelings about Missy.' Roosevelt left Missy half of his $3 million estate.","Franklin D. Roosevelt allegedly carried on affairs with at least five women .

"Forensic experts are excavating a number of graves in a chapel in Madrid in the hopes of finding the resting place of author Miguel de Cervantes. The Don Quixote-writer was buried at the Convent of the Barefoot Trinitarians in Madrid's historic Literary Quarter in 1616, but the exact location of the grave within the chapel is unknown . A team of archaeologists and anthropologists have now started  decided to start excavations at the site after identifying what they believe are three unrecorded and unidentified graves in the chapel's crypt. Discovery: Experts analyse bones to find the remains of the 17th Century author Miguel de Cervantes at the Convent of the Barefoot Trinitarians in Madrid . Clues: Miguel de Cervantes, considered to be Spains greatest writer and the author of 'Don Quixote' was buried in 1616 at the Convent of the Barefoot Trinitarians in Madrid, but the exact whereabouts of his grave within the tiny convent chapel are unknown . The first phase of the excavation, costing some £37,381, is expected to last two weeks . Cervantes is best known for his 1605 novel The Adventures of the Ingenious Nobleman Don Quixote of La Mancha, which changed Spanish literature in the 17th century. His wife, Catalina Salazar, was also buried at the convent, although the location of her grave also remains a mystery. The first phase of the excavation, costing some 50,000 euros (£37,381), is expected to last two weeks. A team of more 20 forensic experts began examining the graves in the chapel crypt on Saturday, extracting bones and remains from several graves. Experts paid particular interests to three locations, two niche graves, from where bones were extracted and examined in the crypt, and one grave beneath the terracotta floor. Cervantes is best known for his 1605 novel about Don Quixote, which has been translated into more languages than any book - other than the Bible . Excavation: A team of archaeologists and anthropologists take notes after starting the excavation work after identifying three unrecorded and unidentified graves in the chapel's crypt . Analysis: The bones found will be exhumed and analyze, after that, the experts will try to identify the bones using DNA profiling . Close to the crypt's entrance, two scientists studied images obtained from within another wall niche by using an endoscope camera carefully inserted through a tiny hole. Elsewhere, a team assembled a geo-radar device mounted on wheels to probe other possible underground locations. 'Were we to find remains that fulfill the characteristics we are looking for, we could possibly pass to a next stage. That would be to compare DNA similarities with his sister, but that is a very complex step,' said Francisco Etxeberria, a forensic medicine specialist from the University of the Basque Country. The author's sister, Luisa de Cervantes, was buried in a convent in Alcala de Henares, 19 miles east of Madrid, where she was interred in 1623. Almudena Garcia Rubio, who is leading the Cervantes project, said Friday if they don't find Cervantes' remains in the places so far identified, there are four other possible locations at the convent they could try next. Evidence marking the location of Cervantes' grave is believed to have been lost during an enlargement of the church after his death. Etxeberria said, back in Cervantes' day, graves were not often marked with long-lasting memorials such as carved headstones. Before settling down to work, the forensic team had to shift piles of old books and bookcases from the space, which had previously been rented out to a publishing company. Don Quixote was the magnum opus of Miguel de Carvantes and was published in two volumes, in 1605 and 1615. It is considered the most influential work of Spanish literature and is considered one of the greatest works of fiction ever published. Carvantes influence on the Spanish language has been so great that the language is often referred to as 'the language of Cervantes'. The author died in 1616 at the age of 69. In accordance with his wishes, Cervantes was burried in in the Convent of the Barefoot Trinitarians in Madrid's historic Barrio de las Letras, or Literary Quarter. His bones went missing in 1673 when work was undertaken at the convent. They were thought to have initially been taken to another convent before being returned.","Experts dig in chapel in Madrid to uncover Cervantes' grave .

"More than a third of people in some of the country’s best-loved seaside resorts are over-65, leaving them struggling to survive without an influx of young people, new figures revealed today. In one town, Southwold in Suffolk, half of people are now retired, according to a new study by the Office for National Statistics. MPs warned that without urgent investment in the 270 coastal communities in England and Wales some areas will struggle to retain the working age families needed to fuel the economies of towns dominated by old people’s homes. The new census of coastal communities shows that on average 20 per cent of people living in them are aged 65 or over, compared to 16 per nationwide. However, a detailed breakdown reveals that in places like Milford on Sea in Hampshire, Fairlight in East Sussex, Sidmouth in Devon and Charmouth in Dorset the figure is more than 40 per cent and it is over 30 per cenrt in Bexhill in East Sussex and Christchurch in Dorset. The ONS said the data confirms the widely-held perception that ‘older people are more likely to live by the coast’. ‘In general, the smaller the coastal community the higher the share of population aged 65 or over, with the share rising from a 17 per cent average among the large coastal communities to a 25 per cent average among the small coastal communities.’ It also means there are fewer children: just 17 per cent in coastal towns are aged 0-15, compared to 19 per cent for England and Wales overall. It means that 8 out of the 10 areas with the highest average age in the whole country are by the sea. In 2011, some 6.2million people lived in a coastal communities, including 2.2 million who lived within the 12 largest. It means that 11 per cent of people live by the sea. While people choose to move to the seaside in their retirement, it can mean areas struggle to cope with increased demand on health and social care services. Some 7 per cent of people in coastal areas have a long-term health problem that means day to day activities were ‘limited a lot’, compared to 5.7 per cent of people nationwide. Half of people in Southwold in Suffolk are aged over 65, the highest proportion of any seaside town in the country . Higher numbers of elderly people with health problems can put added pressure on care services . Torbay MP Adrian Sanders, a member of the all-party group for coastal communities, said . ‘Clearly there are increased social costs of being migratory places for retired people. At the moment when they move into an area they are at the top of their earnings capacity, but then they dip into savings.’ He warned that many areas councils have agreed large numbers of developments for gated retirement blocks and old people’s homes. ‘We need to retain more of the working age, skilled people. A lot of it comes down to the housing policy. If you don’t build in order to secure enough affordable housing for working age people on low wages the only people who will invest will be the likes of McCarthy and Stone. ‘With the best will in the world pensioners aren’t the kind of people who are going to be going out and buying new furniture and renovating their properties. It is younger, working-age people who go out and spend money on those things. Torbay MP Adrian Sanders said more needed to be done to retain skilled, working age people in coastal towns . He said a major problem was that people pay into council tax funds where they spend their working lives, but when they move to the seaside it is the coastal councils who have to pick up the social care bill. He warned that the money given to coastal towns was ‘miniscule’ compared to other regional growth funding. Mr Sanders insisted that there are also positives to having more retired people, who are ‘really helpful at running community groups and charities’ and acting as councillors or school governors. ‘They help to build stronger communities,’ he added. The ONS data also shows how coastal communities differ from the rest of the country. More than 95 per cent of people living by the coast are white, compared to 86 per cent in England and Wales. Over half the coastal communities had in excess of 98 per cent of population with white ethnicity, the ONS said. People are more likely to live in rented homes at the seaside. Some 19 per cent of families are in rented properties, compared to 15 per cent across the country. There are also more empty homes. The census in 2011 found 1.1 million houses which were not occupied by usual residents. These include holiday homes or apartments and properties with short-term residents. In England and Wales in 2011, 4.4 per cent of household spaces were unoccupied by usual residents. The average was the same for large coastal communities, slightly higher (5.5 per cent) for medium sized coastal communities but higher (10.5 per cent) in small coastal communities. Overall, across all coastal communities in this report the average was 6.1 per cent. In Southwold in Suffolk and Salcombe in Devon, half of homes were not lived in full-time.","6.2million people live in a coastal community in England and Wales .

"Florentina Balanescu, five, weighed just 11 pounds after being fed nothing but the Romanian version of Wotsits since she was born . A five-year-old girl who was found weighing just 11 pounds after being fed nothing but the Romanian version of Wotsits could be adopted by the nurse who helped save her life. Oana Cobilita, 34, is battling EU red tape so she can adopt Florentina Balanescu, who weighed the same as 3-month-old baby, when she was found lying starved and neglected. The little girl was taken malnourished and in a critical condition to the Santa Maria Children's Hospital in the city of Iași  in eastern Romania. Her parents Mihai Balanescu, 39, and his wife Camelia, 36, had fed their daughter with cheap corn puffs, known locally as Pufuleti, and water ever since she was born. Medics gave her a life-saving drip and put her on a special diet, and worked round-the-clock to try and help the child to put on weight. Now her nurse Oana Cobilita, 34, is fighting to adopt her after the EU imposed a notoriously bureaucratic procedure. She has spent every weekend with the nurse's family, but despite the clear bond, Romanian officials have so far ignored the request. Ms Cobilita said: 'It was really heartbreaking to see how tiny she was and to realise how much she had been neglected when she first came here. 'Of course as a nurse you want to help the sick but she was so tiny and helpless that everyone here was praying for her to pull through. 'It was amazing how she responded to attention, she was so happy to be finally picked up and played with and has made amazing progress. 'I didn't want her to spend all her time in the hospital so started taking her on trips and getting her to spend time with me and my family so she could experience a bit of normal life, and I realised that I wanted to continue caring for her and so I started the process to adopt her.' The Romanian procedure for adoption is notoriously bureaucratic, imposed after the EU forced the country to ban overseas adoptions and tighten up procedures for adoptions within the country. This has left many children without the hope of anything other than an institutional future. She had been found lying starved and neglected in her bed, too weak to move, and massively malnourished by social workers . Medics gave her a life-saving drip and put her on a special diet, and worked round-the-clock to try and help the child to put on weight . Social workers recently announced that as Florentina does not need to be in hospital, she will be sent to the nearest special needs care home, 74 miles away in Barlad, Vaslui County. One hospital insider supporting the nurse said: 'I find it incredible that all the personal care and effort Oana has put into helping Florentina is simply ignored. 'You only need to see what an amazing recovery she's made in just a few short months to realise that this is a very visible sign she is in the right place and with the right person.' Professor Marin Burlea, manager of the gastroenterology department at the Santa Maria Hospital said it is now a race against time to stop the child being torn away from the person she has finally learned to trust. Florentina's (left) nurse  Oana Cobilita, 34, (right) is fighting to adopt her after the EU imposed a notoriously bureaucratic procedure . He said: I don't think there is any doubt the girl will suffer if she goes to an institution because she won't be taken care of and loved the same way she would be in the family that she has now found.' From being bought in on the verge of death in February, seven months later she now weighs 33 pounds which according to doctors is slightly over the regular weight for a child of her height. Her parents claimed that with five other children aged between 4 and 11-years-old to feed, they had no other choice than to feed the girl Pufuleti (right) Ms Cobilita has been devastated at the thought that Florentina is going to be moved to a disabled orphanage. Facilities at children's homes in Romania are notoriously poor and in particular facilities for disabled children are thought of as the worst. Florentina's natural parents meanwhile who are under police investigation for neglecting their children have made it clear they do not want and cannot afford to have the girl. A police investigation against them for neglect is still being carried out. From being bought in on the verge of death in February, seven months later she now weighs 33 pounds which according to doctors is slightly over the regular weight for a child of her height .

"Next year’s World Cup may mark the end of Dylan Hartley’s England career after unconfirmed reports in France suggested that the hooker is poised to join Montpellier next season. The 28-year-old is the most-capped player in the national squad at present, having made 58 Test appearances since his debut against the Pacific Islanders at Twickenham six years ago. He has been Northampton captain since 2009 and during that period the Saints have won the Aviva Premiership title, finished as runners-up, reached a Heineken Cup Final and won both the Amlin Challenge Cup and LV Cup. Dylan Hartley is tackled by All Blacks Richie McCaw and Kieran Read (right) at Twickenham last Saturday . VIDEO England 21-24 New Zealand highlights . Hartley’s career has been punctuated by disciplinary issues, but his club have supported him, not least when he incurred an 11-week ban which ruled him out of last year’s Lions tour after being sent off and found guilty of swearing at referee Wayne Barnes in the 2013 Premiership Final. In return, he has been an inspirational talisman for Northampton and a cult hero at Franklin’s Gardens. However, his contract is up at the end of this season and reports across the Channel claim Hartley has visited Montpellier to view the facilities and will join the club on a three-year deal after the World Cup. There has been no official confirmation from Montpellier or Hartley’s advisers, but if he does make that overseas move, it will bring an end to his Test career. England hooker Hartley, who was born in New Zealand, has been skipper of Northampton Saints since 2009 . Hartley tackles Gordon D'Arcy (left) during England's clash with Ireland at Twickenham in March 2013 . The RFU and England management are continuing to enforce a policy of not selecting players based abroad and just last week, national coach Stuart Lancaster reiterated his commitment to that stance – aimed at stopping an exodus of English talent to wealthy French clubs. Hartley would be 33 by the time of the 2019 World Cup, so he may have concluded that next year’s home tournament would be a fitting finale at international level. For Northampton, the loss of their skipper would be a major blow as they seek to consolidate their status as English champions and European challengers. Hartley may not be the only Saint on his way out at the end of the season. Further French reports claim that American No 8 Samu Manoa has agreed to join Toulon, while Samoan centre George Pisi has been linked with a move to Castres. Hartley (centre) packs down for a session on the scrum machine with David Wilson (left) and Joe Marler . For England, it would be a significant setback to no longer have the services of a pack stalwart, especially as the stocks of Test-class options at hooker are not vast. Tom Youngs of Leicester has been stalked by injuries since making his breakthrough into the national ranks, as has Bath’s Rob Webber. London Irish No 2 David Paice is the next man in line at present, while Harlequins’ Joe Gray was in the squad for the summer tour of New Zealand. But looking ahead to the post-World Cup period, Luke Cowan-Dickie of Exeter is seen as the rising force in that position. If Lancaster is to lose Hartley soon, he will hope to see the rookie Chief making strong strides towards international honours.","Unconfirmed reports in France suggest that Northampton Saints hooker Dylan Hartley is poised to join Montpellier next season .

"Conservative MP John Whittingdale said the licence fee was ‘unsustainable’ The BBC licence fee is ‘worse than the poll tax’ and needs to be overhauled, the chair of the influential Commons Culture, Media and Sport committee has said. Conservative MP John Whittingdale said the licence fee was ‘unsustainable’ and needed to be brought up to date with how people now watched TV. He suggested that the licence fee could be added on to people’s council tax to make it cheaper for the poor. Earlier this year, Culture Secretary Sajid Javid suggested the licence fee could be cut if the Tories win the election. He said £145.50 a year is a ‘large amount’ of money and ‘needs to be looked at’. Mr Javid also raised the prospect of a fundamental reform of the flat-rate licence fee to reflect the amount of TV watched on the internet. Mr Whittingdale’s call for a fundamental change to the way the corporation is funded increases pressure on the Government to reform the licence fee. He said: ‘I think in the long term it's unsustainable. ‘I think most people, almost everybody, accepts that the licence fee as it currently stands need some tweaking to sort out anomalies. ‘People's viewing habits have changed and it needs to reflect that. That's a very simple change and I think people see that. ‘You then have the question of whether or not it should remain a flat poll tax, collected through some fairly draconian measures, and whether it should still be criminally enforceable.' Mr Whittingdale added: ‘Government has already announced consultation on decriminalisation. I've been looking at other countries and I think there's quite an attractive option of linking it to a specific household tax - maybe council tax. ‘I think in the longer term we are potentially looking at reducing at least a proportion of the licence fee that is compulsory and offering choice.’ BBC Director General Tony Hall, pictured outside Broadcasting House in London, is facing a fight to protect the licence fee from being cut . Culture Secretary Sajid Javid suggested the licence fee could be cut if the Tories win the election . He added: ‘It's a question of introducing choice. I'm not saying I wouldn't pay the licence fee - I would go on paying the licence fee. ‘[But] It is a poll tax. It's actually worse than a poll tax because under the poll tax, if you were on a very low income you would get a considerable subsidy. ‘The BBC licence fee, there is no means-tested element whatsoever; it doesn't matter how poor you are, you pay £145.50 and go to prison if you don't pay it.’ He added the era when ‘everybody either watched or listened to the BBC’ was becoming ‘less true’, in the face of the catch-up services, online streaming, and more choice. Mr Whittingdale said there was not a 'serious possibility of the licence fee going in the next charter renewal' adding: 'When I say it’s unsustainable I am talking about over 20-50 years.'","Chair of  Commons Culture, Media and Sport committee slams licence fee .

"UKIP leader Nigel Farage has been accused of putting ‘fear in people’s hearts’ by scaremongering about immigration in a ferocious attack by a Tory minister. Anna Soubry told Mr Farage 'I don't like your tone' and accused him of spreading ‘prejudice’ instead of using facts. The outspoken defence minister also appeared to draw parallels between UKIP and the rise of fascism, claiming Mr Farage was using tough economic times to ‘turn to the stranger and you blame them’. Scroll down for video . Clash: UKIP leader Nigel Farage became embroiled in an angry exchange with defence minister Anna Soubry . Row: The pair exchanged verbal blows during a heated episode of BBC's Question Time from Boston in Lincolnshire . The extraordinary criticism from one . of the Tory party’s rising stars will alarm strategists who had warned . against alienating disaffected voters who had switched to the UK . Independence Party. David . Cameron has been careful not to repeat his 2006 claim that UKIP is a . ‘bunch of fruit cakes and loonies and closet racists’, insisting he will . now not ‘insult’ those who have chosen to support the anti-EU party. There . was anger in Downing Street when veteran Cabinet minister Kenneth . Clarke suggested some UKIP politicians are racists and its members are . 'clowns'. His remarks, . which came just days before the local elections in May, which saw huge . gains for Mr Farage's party, were disowned by colleagues. However, appearing on BBC’s Question Time last night Ms Soubry tore into Mr Farage’s populist anti-immigration rhetoric. Ms Soubry said: ‘I don't like your tone, Mr . Farage. You do not talk facts. You talk prejudice. That’s what you talk. You scaremonger and you put fear in people’s hearts. ‘Look, times are tough. We know that. But . when times are tough, there’s a danger and history tells us when things . are not good, you turn to the stranger and you blame them. ‘And you . shouldn’t. That is wrong. And I’m proud of our country’s history and I’m . proud that people come here.’ Anna Soubry describes herself as a 'tough old bird' and is not afraid to speak her mind, even if it is not government policy. The former TV presenter fronted This Morning in the 1980s and retrained spent 15 years as a barrister before being elected MP for Broxtowe in 2010. The single mother-of-two was quickly promoted to public health minister, but complained she was only given the job because it is 'a soft bloody girly option'. She also warned rebellious Tories to stop 'quite a lot of t*******' and focus on winning the election. Later, she said it was possible to tell a poor person because they were often fat, complained about the size of cakes and said eating a sandwich at your desk is 'disgusting'. In last month's reshuffle she was moved to become the first Tory woman minister at the Ministry of Defence. The searing critique came after Mr . Farage again warned of the threat of an influx of Romanians and . Bulgarians into the UK when working restrictions are lifted next year. He said he warned about a similar increase in immigration from Poland a decade ago. The Labour government predicted a population increase of 13,000 people per year, he said. ‘I . said that was nonsense because logic said if you extend to poor people . the ability to come to a rich country they’ll come in huge numbers. And . in the first two years, 800,000 people came. That…is a fact.’ But during angry exchanges, a member of the audience accused him of ‘bandying about figures’ and ‘scaremongering’. The government has refused to provide an official estimate for the number of people expected to come from Bulgaira and Romania, but privately expect it to be much lower than those from Poland because Britain is among the last countries to lift the restrictions. Ms Soubry said: ‘People come here to work. 'They come to Boston to work and they work in the fields as you know. They pick the vegetables. ‘The real debate is about why there are so many people in our country who choose not to work. I don’t like your tone Mr Farage. ‘You talk about facts – in my constituency your party put out a leaflet saying 29 million people from Romania and Bulgaria were going to flood into our country. 'The population is only 27.5 million of the two of them.’ But Mr Farage insisted young people in Britain were unable to find jobs because wages had been undercut by migrant workers. Criticism: The Tories had moved to tone down attacks on UKIP, after David Cameron called them 'fruitcakes and racists' in 2006 and earlier this year Ken Clarke dismissed the party as 'clowns' Today he hit back, branding Ms Soubry's attack ‘pretty unpleasant’. Mr Farage said: ‘I don’t like it but it is exactly what I expect. The main motivation of the political class in this country is its own self-perpetuation and there is no depth to which they are not prepared to stoop to try and maintain that status quo. ‘They are getting very concerned about UKIP but I think their fear is now broader than just the European elections,' he told the Telegraph. 'You only have to look at the results from district and country council by-elections up and down the country to see that UKIP is very consistently and clearly out-performing its poll-ratings. 'People are beginning to vote UKIP in domestic elections as well as in European elections.’","Anna Soubry tears into UK Independence Party leader Nigel Farage .

"A husband who was stabbed four times and almost had his eyes gouged out says he loves and forgives his wife, even after she nearly killed him. Derek Burns was so badly injured in a prolonged drunken rage that police thought he was going to die. Wendy Burns, 49, was jailed at Caernarfon Crown Court last week for six years after she admitted using an eight-inch knife to stab him four times, trying to gouge out his eyes, smashing him in the head with a glass ashtray and repeatedly punching his face. Stabbed: Derek Burns was so badly injured in a prolonged drunken rage that police thought he was going to die . But Mr Burns, 62, says he stands by her. He said: 'I’ve written to her four times, telling her I forgive her, but have never received a reply.' He said she’d been arrested several times for attacking him during their 15-year marriage. And he told how he’d urged the court to reduce the charge against her from attempted murder to wounding with intent. Mr Burns said his wife had a troubled past and he forgives her, misses her and still loves her. 'I wrote to her sister saying that if I could be of any help without getting in the way I would be happy to. 'I . tried to get the charges lessened from attempted murder, and in the end . they did. When my son told me she’d got six years I was in shock. I . thought she’d only get three. I don’t believe we’ll ever get back . together but I would have wanted to. 'She made a statement to her solicitor saying she didn’t love me any more, in fact she didn’t even like me. Jailed: Wendy Burns had been arrested several times for attacking her husband during their 15 year marriage . 'I would go and visit her but I don’t think I’ll get the chance - I don’t think she’d let me.' Mr Burns, of Flint, North Wales, said he and his wife had been drinking on the night their relationship came to a shocking and violent end. 'I didn’t have a clue what she was about to do,' he said. We hadn’t been arguing, we’d just been sitting talking. 'I was sitting in one of these chairs. She was sitting on the settee. She suddenly said ‘I want a divorce’. 'She had asked quite a few times for a divorce, but it was always when she had been drinking. 'Whenever I asked her about it the next day she wouldn’t even remember it and would say ‘just ignore me, you know what I’m like when I get drunk’. 'But I said ‘okay, but you won’t be able to live here because this place is in my name’. I was trying to reason with her. 'She just stood up and the next thing I knew she was right on me with a knife. 'It was the biggest knife we’ve got, it’s so big it’s kept in a separate drawer in a sheath. 'She tried to stab me in the chest with it but I managed to twist my body and she hit me here,' he said, pointing at his side. 'I got as close to her as I could to try to stop her stabbing me again, and that’s when she stabbed me in the back. 'I was screaming at her ‘You’re going to ruin your life’. 'She had me down on the floor and smashed an ashtray into my head, and anything she could find. 'I . thought if she gets another swing with that knife, that’s it. I grabbed . the handle as low down as I could, where it’s not so sharp. But the . blood was like oil. 'I . threw it and I think it bounced behind the settee. I started kicking on . the floor with my foot and screaming for help, and that’s when she . walked away. 'She phoned . the paramedics first and threw the phone on the floor next to me. The . paramedic told me to keep talking. I don’t remember much more, but the . police said they thought I was going to die. 'The whole of these walls were covered in blood. A lot of stuff had to be thrown out.' Mr . Burns and his wife met when he was manager of Flint Sports and Social . Club. At the time he was married to first wife Pat, who had been . diagnosed with breast cancer. 'Wendy came in and worked for us,' he said, 'We went about in a foursome, me and Pat and Wendy and her boyfriend.' Pat died in 1995 after 27 years of marriage. They had three children, all now adults. About nine months after Pat’s death, Mr Burns found Wendy sitting on her own having just fallen out with her boyfriend. In happier times: Wendy and Derek on their wedding day. The couple met when he was the manager of Flint Sports and Social Club and got together after the death of his first wife Pat from cancer . He asked her if she wanted to go for a drink, 'and we gradually started seeing each other more and more', he said. They were married in 1996 at Chester Register Office. 'Everything was fine. It was only after a few years, if she started drinking vodka she would start an argument.' The arguments could turn violent he said. 'My daughter saw her hit me in the face with a laptop. She was down from Prestatyn with my granddaughter, and they had just said goodnight. 'Then for whatever reason Wendy picked up the laptop and swooshed it into my face. But my daughter had forgotten her handbag and opened the door and saw it. That was a couple of years ago. 'From that day they never got on, but before that they were good friends.' He said Mrs Burns had been arrested a few times over a period of years for attacking him. Problems: Mr Burns said a lot of his wife's anger came from her upbringing. He said she came from a dysfunctional family and her father regularly beat her mother and she's always had problems with violence . 'The only time I retaliated was when she attacked me with a knife before. I went to court for it, I did a two year probation period for anger management,' he said. He said part of the problem was that it was hard to admit that he was being attacked by his wife. 'It’s not something men like to talk about, being beaten up by their wives. It should be talked about more,' he said. 'It was only when she had been drinking. She was alright any other time, she was a good, hard working woman. She only drank at the weekends.' He said he had finally sold the bungalow they shared and given half of the money to her solicitor, even though the house was his. Asked where the anger came from, he said: 'A lot of it was her upbringing. She came from a very dysfunctional family. Her father regularly beat her mother and Wendy was in the middle of it all the time. 'She’s had problems all her life with violence. One of the first things she told me was ‘no man will ever beat me’, because of what she had seen with her father.' He said he felt very sorry for her and that she needed help. 'I’ve written to her four times, telling her I forgive her, but have never received a reply,' he said. Mr Burns, originally from the Scottish Highlands, said his family had all been very supportive. 'Things are getting better, but finding out about her sentence knocked me back,' he said. 'It’s like a bereavement, she was here one day and gone the next. I still wake up thinking she’s there and then you remember, ‘oh no’. 'I’m just very lonely living here on my own. Even though she did what she did I still miss her. I said she’d ruin her life and she did.'","Derek Burns says he misses his wife Wendy and accepts she's had a troubled and violent past .

"They gather on the streets after dusk, ‘making noise, dropping litter and being a nuisance’. But the ever-expanding Roma community don’t understand what the fuss is about. Hanging around outside in the evening is part of their cultural tradition back home in eastern Europe. But to former Home Secretary and Sheffield MP David Blunkett and the residents of Page Hall in Sheffield, it’s a serious problem that is damaging the quality of life in a once peaceful community. The residents are ‘angry’ and want the streets cleared. Frustration? This Roma local is patrolling the streets of Firvale to help his community integrate better . Racial tension and fear of civil unrest is growing, and to make matters worse there are the first signs of vigilante action against the new Roma arrivals. Some residents with strong views about their unwanted neighbours have begun patrolling the streets at night to ‘gather evidence’ of anti-social behaviour and possible criminal activity. In addition, the local Pakistani community association is running ‘official’ warden patrols between 8pm and 10pm every weekday with the intention of ‘educating’ the Roma population about ‘how to behave in England’. Warning: David Blunkett, former Home Secretary, warned that Roma migrants could cause riots . Several volunteers wearing luminous jackets accompany a Slovakian community worker who can speak their language, and politely tell the groups of men, women and children to go back indoors, pick up their litter and stop making a disturbance. An official ‘dispersal order’ has also been in place in recent months, giving police power to break-up street gatherings in Page Hall if they may cause ‘harassment, alarm or distress.’ But so far there are few signs of the issue being resolved. Julie Blacker is a ‘community cohesion worker’ employed by the Police Commissioner who set up a new neighbourhood watch scheme this summer. She admitted there had been ‘tension and frustration’ in the community about the Roma issue, with some people becoming ‘very outspoken’ about the authorities’ failure to deal with it. ‘I’m sure people are very cross,’ she said. ‘They see the area has been hit hard by the EU opening its doors and this area has been swamped a bit. There’s no doubt people are upset about it.’ The Roma population in Sheffield is said to be between 2,000 and 4,000 and growing. More than 1,000 Roma patients are registered to two GP practices alone. Gulnaz Hussain, of the Pakistani Community Advice Centre, is heading the ‘crackdown’ to tackle the street problem and launched the warden patrols three months ago. She has also arranged weekly litter patrols by volunteers. She said: ‘The residential streets here are narrow and can get quite full up when they gather outside. 'You get groups of people making a noise on what used to be quiet streets and it causes a problem. 'The general public have had enough and feel something must be done. We are working to try and integrate the Romas into the community and our way of life here. That’s the best way forward.’ Eviction: Border Agency officials evict immigrants from a derelict site in London. Despite raids such . as this a report has found that just one in every 67 reports of illegal . immigration result in a person being deported . The problem was difficult because the Roma families are not doing anything illegal or criminal by talking in the street, she added. Councillor Ibrar Hussain, who represents the area on the city council, said: ‘People here have been very patient and very tolerant. But there is tension in the community.’ Yesterday Roma families were wandering the streets around Page Hall, many children of school-age among them. None of the adults admitted to speaking English. For the time being the problem appears to be under control. As the cold winter nights set in, fewer people have been gathering outside. But with many more Roma people likely to arrive in Page Hall in the months to come, it could be a very different story next summer. Mistake: Former Home Secretary Jack Straw says 2004 decision to give migrants working rights 'messed up' Former Home Secretary Jack Straw has . admitted that throwing open Britain’s borders to Eastern European . migrants was a ‘spectacular mistake’. Mr Straw said Labour’s 2004 decision . to hand immediate working rights to Poles and migrants from other new EU . states was a ‘well-intentioned policy we messed up’. David Blunkett's warning that the . influx of Roma migrants into Britain risked causing riots reinforced the . significance of Mr Straw’s admission. Mr Straw said Labour failed to . anticipate the scale of migration when eight former Soviet bloc nations . became EU members, and Britain – almost alone in Europe – allowed the . free movement of workers between countries. At the time, the Government predicted . up to 13,000 migrants would come to Britain each year. The actual total . over nearly a decade was more than a million. Virtually every other EU state, apart from Ireland and Sweden, kept their jobs markets closed for the seven years permitted. In an article for the Lancashire Telegraph, Mr Straw – who is MP for Blackburn – admitted . the forecasts were ‘worthless’. Mr Straw said: ‘One spectacular . mistake in which I participated (not alone) was in lifting the . transitional restrictions on the Eastern European states like Poland and . Hungary which joined the EU in mid-2004. ‘Other existing EU members, notably . France and Germany, decided to stick to the general rule which prevented . migrants from these new states from working until 2011. 'But we thought that it would be good for Britain if these folk could come and work here from 2004. ‘Thorough research by the Home Office . suggested that the impact of this benevolence would in any event be . “relatively small, at between 5,000 and 13,000 immigrants per year up to . 2010”. Events proved these forecasts worthless. ‘Net migration reached close to a quarter of a million at its peak in 2010. Lots of red faces, mine included.’","Influx of migrants in Page Hall, Sheffield, has caused racial tensions .

"There are two things women are almost guaranteed to wake up with after a night out dancing in high heels: sore feet and at least one twisted ankle. But did you know you could also wake up with a more toned bottom and slimmer thighs? For while the effect of high heels on women's bodies is widely thought to be negative - stilettos are known to cause everything from joint problems to bunions - fitness fans are increasingly claiming that they are actually the secret to a sculpted physique. A tall order: Anna tries out kicks in her heels . There's just one catch: to feel the full benefit, you have to exercise in sky-high shoes. High-heel workouts are growing in popularity in the U.S. - with classes including 'The Heel Hop Workout' and 'Stiletto Strength', in which women walk, squat and even do sit-ups in heels, on offer in Los Angeles and New York gyms. And now the trend is coming to the UK. Celebrities here already seem to be getting in on the act - high-heel lover Victoria Beckham recently tweeted a picture of herself in 5in-high stiletto boots walking on a treadmill with a desk attached. Which is why I find myself - a 45-year-old who gave up high heels 20 years ago (bar the odd, painful wedding reception or girls’ night out) - standing in my local park wearing Lycra leggings, a vest… and red skyscrapers. Here to teach me the basics of working out in killer heels is British personal trainer Nikki Manashe, who has developed a high-heel workout that claims to tone legs, bottoms, hips, thighs and core abdominal muscles in ways they’ve never been toned before. Shape up: Squats like these in heels are said to tone up the legs and bottom . London-based Nikki, 29, began devising the routine 18 months ago while trying out a range of fitness DVDs, including one based on pole dancing in which participants wore heels. 'This particular workout required you to do squats and lunges while wearing them,' remembers Nikki. 'I had never felt my leg muscles work so hard. 'It instinctively made sense to me. The best workout is done on a hill because doing lower body moves with the ankles lifted slightly higher make the calf, hip and leg muscles work much harder. 'Wearing heels at least 3in high means anything you do that works the lower body is not only more effective, it works the smaller muscles, too. 'You discover soreness in areas that you don't when you’re wearing trainers, especially the bottom muscles, the calves, inner thighs and outer hips.' According to Nikki, the results have been astounding. After 12 months of doing this workout three times a week, her clients have narrower hips, tighter bottoms - and no broken ankles. Yet can this way of exercising really be sensible? After all, podiatrists have been preaching the evils of heels for years, warning that they shorten the Achilles tendon in the ankle and put pressure on discs in the spine by forcing wearers to push their hips forward for balance. Personal trainer Nikki Manashe shows Anna how the workout is done . Last year, the College of Podiatry found that one in ten British women had joint problems, arthritis and muscular issues, and more than half had bunions, as a result of walking in high heels. Despite all this, the prospect of looking great in skinny jeans is tempting - hence my appointment with Nikki. Thankfully, the first thing she does is make me change back into my trainers for a 20-minute run. 'Running in heels is just downright silly, as the risk of falling over and jarring the joints is so high,' she tells me. But as soon as the run is over, it's high-heel time. I pull them on and, feeling rather silly, start three sets of  20 squats. Squat exercises are tough enough in functional footwear: with your legs apart, you lower your bottom on to an imaginary seat using all the strength you can muster. With three inches from the heels added to my 5ft 3in frame, I have to lower my bottom further, which works my calves and hips so hard they burn. I’m pouring with sweat by the end of the third set. I include squats in my daily workout and usually find them perfectly manageable - but these ones hurt in whole new areas, most notably my inner thighs. 'Right, kick-boxing next,' shouts Nikki, pulling out a pair of sparring pads from her bag of props. 'What, in heels?' I ask. Can she be serious? Anna did get some unusual looks when she did moves like tricep dips on a park bench in her heels . Oh yes. I have to get into fighting stance and kick my back foot forward to various heights, hitting the pad with the side of my calf. Double ouch. To balance requires a laser-like focus, which means I can think of little else but staying on my feet - and how much my tummy muscles are hurting. We move on to walking lunges with bicep curls - putting one stilettoed foot in front of the other and lowering my body weight almost to the ground before lifting the back foot up and doing it again, curling my arms at the same time - for 100 metres. By the halfway point I'm gasping for breath, my bottom and leg muscles crying  for mercy. We're also getting stares from passers-by: working out in heels isn't for the shy and retiring. Yet when a truck goes by with a catchy song blaring from its open windows, I break into a dance - normally reserved for wedding receptions - and begin joyously waving splayed arms about, shaking  my booty and doing my best mum-dancing. Suddenly, I feel 25 and sexy again. It's as if I've had a glimpse of the reckless young woman I used to be, teetering in my thigh-high stilettoed boots on the dance floor or strutting across town in bright-red patent Mary Janes, and loving the powerfully sexy feeling it gives me. 'High heels make you feel sexy and more confident,' says Nikki. 'For clients who hate working out, it's a great way of forgetting they’re trying to get fit and making the workout more fun. 'And exercising in heels can make you feel more comfortable in them on nights out.' Word of warning: Physios warn that exercising in heels can cause damage to the joints . The next day, I can hardly walk and my inner and outer thighs are so sore that just sitting down causes moans of agony. But it's the good pain that a tough workout can bring, and makes me wonder if I should pop on some heels while using my favourite workout DVDs. However, physiotherapist Tim Allardyce has some words of warning: 'Working out in high heels is absolutely crazy and completely ridiculous. 'You're increasing the stress through your legs because you're working out with your feet in an abnormal position. Most of the force is going into the big toe, which can lead to bunions.' It can also damage joints, he says. 'If you work out wearing heels instead of trainers, the foot doesn't adequately absorb the force of movements such as lunges and squats. That force has to go somewhere, so it adds unhealthy pressure to the knees, the hips, the ankles and back.' This can also increase the risk of back pain, injury and inflammation, he warns. 'The lower back is under so much pressure in heels because all your weight is shifted forwards. That means the discs in the lower spine are at greater risk of becoming stiff and inflamed, and this could lead to serious back injuries such as prolapsed disc where a spinal disc presses against a nerve root in the back causing severe pain.' So is there any merit in high-heeled workouts? 'I can see how it can strengthen the calf muscles because the calves have to work harder with the ankle on an incline,' admits Tim. 'It can also potentially improve balance because there is less contact with the ground, so other muscles are forced to work harder to keep you upright and stabilise your body. 'In fact, every muscle in the leg will work harder if you're wearing high heels. 'But there are much better and safer ways to strengthen leg muscles - starting with good supportive trainers.' Maybe I won't be throwing my stilettos into my gym bag just yet. But I might make the effort to go out dancing with the girls again - my thighs will thank me for it.

"A Thai tourist faced down a charging elephant and stopped it in its tracks with just a wave of his hand. Tor Bowling, 27, was visiting Phu Luang Wildlife Sanctuary, northern Thailand, when the elephant came charging straight towards him out of the dense jungle. But rather than understandably screaming and running for his life, Mr Bowling simply held up his hand up to the animal, which stopped, turned around, and walked away. You shall not pass! Brave Tor Bowling wards off an elephant charge with a wave of his hand . Maybe I won't squash you after all, human: The rampaging elephant amazingly seems to comply . Err, yes: The beast gives an almighty shriek and turns away from the intrepid tourist . ... who wastes no time in holding up his camera and firing off a few frames of the departing pachyderm . A video of Mr Bowling's bravery has now been viewed millions of times online. Mr . Bowling, an engineer from Chonburi, near Bangkok, told the New York . Daily News that he had quit his job out of boredom and was spending a . month travelling around his country while he looks for new direction in . life. It was the afternoon . of February 28 when he was making his way along a dirt path at Phu Luang . with his friend Navee Kittisak, on their way back to civilisation after . going to see a dinosaur footprint. The . reserve is home to around a hundred wild Asian elephants, cared for by . the Thai royal family-sponsored Elephants Rehabilitation Project. Mr . Bowling was visiting during the local summer season, when Phu Luang . blossoms with colourful dendrobiums, white wild orchids, and white and . red rhododendrons. Mr Bowling told Daily News reporter Joel Landau that when he first saw the elephant, a moment not included in the clip, he froze and stared at it for a long time. He tried to edge away, but the elephant tracked his every move, he said. Then the beast charged. Mr Bowling admitted he was afraid. Extending his hand at the animal was merely his first reaction, he admitted - a completely unpremeditated response. 'But I'm sure,' he said. 'It didn't want to hurt me.' And indeed it didn't for, as the video shows, mere inches from Mr Bowling's outstretched arm, the elephant stops, lets out a fierce shriek, and turns away. Fear: Mr Dowling said he had spent a long time frozen to the spot staring after he saw the elephant in the bush . He said he was frightened when it charged, but looking back he thinks it didn't want to hurt him . As it pads off into the bush, Mr Bowling showed just how much composure he had maintained by holding up his camera and capturing a few shots of the retreating animal for his photo album. He then turns to Mr Kittisak, who was filming the incident, and chuckles. Mr Bowling told the Daily News his sanguine reaction in the face of near certain death beneath the stomping feet of the elephant was just down to his positive attitude. 'I always think (everything that happens to me) is a special moment and I think I'm lucky to have had the chance to experience that,' he was quoted as saying. 'I don't need (to think of things) as bad memories. So I smile to make it a good situation.' Despite their popular association with Thailand, often as domesticated beasts of burden, Asian elephants are an endangered species because of the illegal trade in ivory.

"Charged: Sara Barnes, 26, was arrested for burning down a historic tree while doing illegal drugs . A young model allegedly set a fire that caused one of the world's oldest cypress trees to burn and collapse because she needed light in the darkness to see what drugs she was doing. Sara Barnes, 26, of Winter Park, Florida, was identified by two witnesses as the person who caused the 118ft bald cypress tree named ‘The Senator’ to burn and collapse on January 16, police said. The woman allegedly took photos of the fire on the 3,500-year-old tree with her phone but did not call 911 - and authorities found methamphetamine, scales and drug paraphernalia at her home. One of the first photos seen on her . public Facebook profile is of clumps of marijuana. Agricultural . officials searched her home on Tuesday and also confiscated her mobile . phone and laptop. Since . Barnes’s arrest was made public, she has received plenty of harsh criticism because the . tree - dated by park officials thanks to its ring samples - was a . beloved historic symbol in Longwood, Florida. Too late: Seminole County and Longwood firemen watched helplessly as the 3,500-year-old tree burned . Not one with nature: Authorities found methamphetamine and drug paraphernalia at Barnes's home in Florida . Model: Sara Barnes, 26, of Winter Park, Florida, was identified by two witnesses as the person who caused the 118ft bald cypress tree named 'The Senator' to burn and collapse on January 16, police said . A $30,000 fence is planned to be . built nearby to stop visitors stealing the remaining portions of the . tree, or from standing too near Lady Liberty, a neighbouring . 2,000-year-old cypress tree. The tree made it 165ft before a 1925 . hurricane lopped off its top, park officials say. Native American . Indians who lived throughout central Florida would use the tree as a . landmark. In the late 19th century it became a popular . visitor attraction. It was the . centrepiece of Longwood's Big Tree Park and believed to be the oldest of . its kind in North America. It . was also thought to be the fifth oldest in the world. Firefighters had a . difficult time getting to the tree at Longwood's Big Tree Park and had . to run almost a mile of hose to get to The Senator. Famed: It was named for Senator M.O. Overstreet who donated the tree's land to the state in 1927 .

A 20ft section of the tree fell off at . 7:45am, and the tree collapsed a half-hour later. According . to News13, firefighters had to keep a considerable distance. As the . heat rose, the top of tree burned, sending burning limbs falling more . than 100ft to the ground below. Later, . a sheriff's helicopter dumped water on the smouldering tree. The .

"Everton defender Leighton Baines says the club’s expansive style of football is ‘well-suited’ to doing well in the Champions League over the next few years under manager Roberto Martinez. Baines will be a key figure when Everton meet Lille in the Europa League knowing victory would virtually guarantee them a place in the knockout stages. For the 29-year-old England left back, it is the perfect dummy run for what he expects to be bigger European campaigns to come. Leighton Baines believes Everton would be well-suited to playing Champions League football . The Everton team train ahead of their Europa League clash with Lille on Thursday . ‘We all want to bring that next level of football to this club,’ he said. ‘That is the motivation and what we are all working towards. We don’t just want do well, we want to create real special memories. 'There is no ceiling to how we are developing. We play the same style as the top teams and if we go into the Champions League it would be well-suited to that level of football. The way we play means we’d be able to compete with better opposition.’ Baines has been in top form after a move to Manchester United fell through last year when the Old Trafford club offered what Everton called a ‘derisory’ £28million for him and Marouane Fellaini. He signed a new four-year deal at the start of 2014 and his next Premier League assist will equal Graeme Le Saux’s record for a defender (44). ‘I’ve found it quite easy to keep moving forward,’ he added. 'I’ve stayed and younger players like Seamus Coleman, Ross Barkley and John Stones have all signed long-term contracts. It is a real sign of where the club is.’ Martinez also insists players such as Barkley won’t be sold. ‘We are on a very strong footing financially and any decisions made about players will be based around football. Being in Europe helps with that,’ the Spaniard confirmed. Ross Barkley, who recently returned from training and American goalkeeper Tim Howard in training . Everton may have to watch out for in-form striker Divock Origi when they face Lille at Goodison park . So far, Everton have produced a fine Europa League campaign, beating Wolfsburg at home and drawing away to Krasnodar and Lille to top their group. Winning the competition guarantees entry into next season’s Champions League, which may be more realistic than a top-four finish in the Barclays Premier League. Their main concern will be Lille’s £10million striker Divock Origi — on loan from Liverpool — and 36-year-old defender Sylvain Distin could be drafted in to stop him after Antolin Alcaraz suffered a shoulder injury on Saturday.","Everton face Lille in Europa League on Thursday .

"It's the kind of European night that Liverpool fans have been craving for years. Anfield will be rocking when Real Madrid come to town, but can Brendan Rodgers’ side topple the European champions? Sportsmail’s top pundits give their verdicts... Raheem Sterling and Cristiano Ronaldo go head-to-head as Liverpool take on Real Madrid at Anfield . Sportsmail's Three Wise Men give their verdicts ahead of Liverpool's Champions League clash with Liverpool . How do you stop Madrid? MARTIN KEOWN: Madrid are lethal on the break and Brendan Rodgers will have looked at how they destroyed Bayern last season. Without Bale and Di Maria, they have lost some of that speed, but then there’s Ronaldo. Him running at Lovren and Skrtel is a recipe for disaster. It will be interesting to see if Liverpool stay with a diamond or maybe use two deep midfielders to offer more protection. Cristiano Ronaldo and his Real Madrid team-mates braved adverse weather during Tuesday's training session . JAMIE CARRAGHER: It is essential that Liverpool’s full backs only go forward when it is absolutely necessary. You have to guard against the way Madrid counter attack at blistering pace and they can’t be given opportunities to speed forward. JAMIE REDKNAPP: We all know about Madrid’s speed on the counter but they are a big, powerful side and so dangerous at set-pieces. They scored two in the semi-final against Bayern Munich last season and again against Atletico Madrid in the final. Sergio Ramos being out will help that but it will be very difficult for Liverpool. They must stay strong and Steven Gerrard, Jordan Henderson and Joe Allen have to look after that midfield. Ronaldo gives a thumbs up to his  fans who waited to catch a glimpse of the frontman outside the Hilton hotel . So, how can Liverpool win? REDKNAPP: You have to look at Sterling because he is the stand-out player. If Liverpool can get him on the ball, he will frighten any defender. But the way Liverpool have been defending this season, I don’t think they will keep a clean sheet. The only way they can beat Madrid is to match them in attack and out-score them. KEOWN: They should be licking their lips at the prospect of playing Madrid. Of course it’s a tough game but they should relish the challenge. They have to work the ball well, moving it on quickly and accurately when they are in possession, and a lot depends on the speed of Raheem Sterling and Philippe Coutinho. But the players must enjoy the occasion and draw from it, not be fearful of it. CARRAGHER: By getting back to how they were last season. They need to be aggressive and intense in their play, start quick and get Madrid on the back foot. If they do that, they will have another weapon to use - the Anfield crowd. Liverpool must use the pace and power of Raheem Sterling to frighten the Real Madrid defence on Wednesday . Should Rodgers play Mario Balotelli? KEOWN: Absolutely. If you invest £16million in a player and aren’t prepared to play him after a few games it reflects badly on you. He has to be given the chance to continue the club’s tradition of great strikers. But to do so tonight has to be his greatest night in a Liverpool shirt. CARRAGHER: No. I would go for Sterling as the main striker with Adam Lallana and Coutinho supporting him. Sterling can get in behind a defence but he will also press. Mario Balotelli isn’t doing either at the minute. Sportsmail's Three Wise Men are split on whether Mario Balotelli should start for Liverpool against Madrid . REDKNAPP: I’ve never really taken to him - he acts like a genius but he doesn’t play like one - but I would probably still start him. I can’t see Sterling working as a central striker and though Rickie Lambert would work his socks of, he’s not match-fit. Balotelli has to pray he turns it on, otherwise it could be the end of his relationship with the fans. They won’t tolerate much more. The Liverpool squad appeared in good spirits on Tuesday as they prepare for the visit of mighty Real Madrid . What's your prediction? CARRAGHER: 1-1. Real Madrid might be favourites but there is no chance Liverpool will lie down at home. REDKNAPP: I agree with Jamie. I’ve played enough times at Anfield to know how much the crowd can lift the team. Madrid will win the home game but I’ve got a feeling Liverpool can sneak a draw on Wednesday night. 1-1. KEOWN: The electric Anfield atmosphere could power Liverpool to a special performance, so we could be in for a thriller. But I still feel Madrid are too strong. A 2-1 away win for the Spaniards.

"It may only be October but on London's Oxford Street Christmas is in full swing and nowhere quite does it like Selfridges. The world famous department store unveiled its legendary Christmas windows this morning showcasing over a year's worth of hard work, creativity and festive thinking. And for 2014 for the first time ever, Selfridges gave a lucky few members of the press an exclusive glimpse into the making of Oxford Street's most spectacular windows. FEMAIL headed down last night to discover the method behind the magic. A work of art: A Little Red Riding Hood themed window sees a mannequin dressed in a custom made Peter Pilotto cape and 10,000 laser cut leaves . For the past eight days the department store has been looking rather naked as the the in-house team completed final preparations on the much anticipated displays with the store front hidden behind vinyl stickers. Last night saw the vinyl come down and the lights come up to a small but excited audience. The theme for this year's Christmas displays evolved from the notion of storytelling. The idea is spread right across the store with book motifs appearing on escalators, counters and hanging from the ceiling. The window displays themselves take inspiration from traditional fairy tales but, with Selfridges famed for their contemporary touch, each story depicted a modern twist. Web of dreams: The golden web hosts dozens of metallic products produced exclusively for the store . Modern fairy tale: This contemporary take on Rapunzel sees mannequins dressed in Rodarte Star Wars print dresses . Not so ugly duckling: The central model wears a feather style dress from AF Vandevorst . Right from the first unveiling of the 23 windows it was clear that these were not your average bedtime stories. A neon pink mannequin dressed in a custom made Peter Pilotto cape stands before you surrounded by woodland animals adorned with an exclusive selection of Erickson Beamon jewellery. At first glance Little Red Riding Hood may not spring to mind but whether you recognise it or not the story has you captivated. The mannequin stands in front of a hand sculpted tree decorated with laser cut leaves in pinks and golds, the creative team later revealed that there were over 10,000 of the intricate leaves created for the windows. Other festive themed fables included the store's take on The Ugly Duckling. The centre mannequin who is sat within a rainbow nest and wears a bespoke feather dress from the SS15 AF Vandevorst, seemed anything other than ugly. Final touches: Even after they have unveiled their window displays there are often some final adjustments to be made . Never ending story: The 23 windows take the team up to 18 months to develop from an idea to display . Destination Christmas: The enormous neon sign is one of the largest to have been featured on the store's canopy . Another highlight that will surely have any festive fashionista swooning was the store's take on Cinderella. Rather than one simple pair of glass slippers, Cinders is surrounded by a plethora of glitzy and metallic heels that will no doubt be the staple footwear of the Christmas party season. Taking centre stage was a very special pair of exclusive Sophia Webster winged heels that are estimated to retail for £800. In the story of of Rumpelstiltskin, the Princess appears to have woven herself an impressive spider's web with the intricate sparkly golden weave acting as a backdrop for the window. Within the web dozens of golden products dangle from the threads, all exclusive to the store, giving a nod to Selfridges' recent installation of a shop of entirely gold products. One member of the design team was quick to add that the golden spider web had been a labour of love. 'The woman who crafted the web told me that it had taken her so long that she had got through ten audio books during its making!' he said. Look familiar? The Golden Goose has certain traits that are inspired by Harry Gordon Selfridge himself, including the top hat . Bedtime stories: This window takes inspiration from Paddington Bear who currently has a concept store within Selfridges . American holiday: The store takes inspiration from New York when it comes to the spruce that surrounds the window . It wasn't just the spider's web that had been a long time coming. October may seem early enough to start Christmas but for Selfridges themselves seasonal plans start even earlier. This year's scheme had been in development since November 2013 when the theme was decided on by the creative team.  Linda Hewson, the store's creative director says that thinking so far ahead is always a risk but it is important to just go with it. 'We take inspiration from all over the place. It can be from festivals or fashion shows and we just begin collecting ideas together before deciding on a final theme. 'You do have to take a risk when anticipating trends so far ahead and it does require a lot of foresight.' Despite having to produce the theme so far ahead, Linda says that they rarely change anything once they have started planning. 'We do have to tweak a few minor things if suddenly discover that something isn't going to work in the window but on the whole we don't tend to change very much once the design is decided on. You just have to go with it.' Linda says that for the Christmas windows they wanted it to be festive but, as always, there had to be a twist. Cyber story: Sleeping Beauty appears out of this world as she dozes inside a perspex neon crystal . Santa Clause is coming to town: Selfridges purchased a real mini and then sliced it in half for this montage . 'This year is slightly more traditional than some of our previous displays' says Linda 'But at the same time it has this hyper-realistic feel it is very other-worldly and all of the colours make it almost like a kaleidoscope.' Hannah Emslie, the Creative Windows Manager at the store says that Christmas gives them a lot more potential to be more extravagant when it comes to windows. 'Because our windows are South facing it means that Christmas is the only time that we can really play with light' says Hannah adding 'Lights are just completely wasted in the summer so we have to just rule them out, so it is really fun to be able to play with them at Christmas.' The scale of which Selfridges does Christmas is just phenomenal. This year alone there are 197,000 baubles, 1,005 Christmas trees and not forgetting the 75 metres of fake hair to create Rapunzel's tresses! The largest installation by far is the decoration for the canopy that over hangs the main entrance to the beauty hall. Said to be one of the store's largest canopy displays it will see 18-20 metres of fairy lights and over a kilometre of neon lighting. Candy land: A sugar coated window houses the store's selection of children's Christmas presents . Bruno Barba, Senior Brand PR Manager for Selfridges, added that the canopy will have one very special guest added this year. 'The main feature will be the Golden Goose. He will be wearing a top hat and a monocle which is a sort of tongue in cheek reminisce towards Harry Gordan Selfridge.' Bruno added that the heavy sprucing that the store use on the windows and canopy is unlike any that yous see in the UK. 'No one does sprucing to this scale' says Bruno. 'You see it everywhere in New York but I have never seen it so thick in any other department store in Britain.' In terms of competition Selfridges are way ahead of their competitors Harrods, Liberty's and Harvey Nichols who aren't due to unveil their windows until early November. Grand finale: A member of the production team adds a final lick of paint to the Golden Goose on the store's canopy . 'It's not intentional' adds Bruno 'We pick a date to unveil every year and we just always end up being the first ones. This is an understanding that all of the stores have.' If you think the unveiling all went without a hitch you would be mistaken. Within minutes of removing the vinyl the creative team were rushing to adjust minor details in the window to ensure perfection. Hannah says that whether there are faults in the window or not they try and adjust them over the festive period to keep their passers by interested. 'Our audience is so vast. Yes, we have people who come actively to see the windows but then we have the people who walk past everyday or stand at the bus stop and we want to keep them interested.' Despite the endless effort that goes into the windows not only in the run up but right over the festive season Hannah seems pleased with her work. 'The windows are always a risk' she says 'But if you really believe in something and it's a good idea, it is always worth it.' OVERALL .

"Baroness Thatcher had criticised David Cameron only a few months ago for not being ‘far enough behind’ Labour in the polls – because he ought to be pushing through unpopular policies. As the Conservative Party grappled with her towering legacy, a friend of the former prime minister said she had also expressed a dislike of the Coalition and urged voters not to support UKIP. Lady Thatcher’s death has prompted a surge of pride among Tory MPs at her government’s extraordinary achievements, but also a degree of soul-searching about the party’s failure to win the last election outright. Leaders: Baroness Thatcher (right) had criticised David Cameron (left) only a few months ago for not being 'far enough behind' Labour in the polls - because he ought to be pushing through unpopular policies . Several senior figures contrasted her refusal to bow to the whims of ‘focus groups’ or the next day’s headlines unfavourably with the behaviour of today’s political leaders. But Left-wing commentator Owen Jones complained that her death was prompting ‘a mixture of Diana’s funeral and a month-long political broadcast for the Conservative Party’. Conor Burns, a Tory MP who visited Lady Thatcher weekly, said: ‘I remember last November showing her a poll in one of the Sunday papers and it showed that we were nine points behind, and she asked when the next election was, and I said it wasn’t for another two and a half years. ‘She said, “That’s not far enough behind at this stage.” She sort of took a view that to do things that were right did entail unpopularity until people saw that what you were doing was working. ‘She always had confidence that what she was doing would work and coincide with the electoral cycle, which is, despite the fact that she’s been written up as this incredibly controversial, divisive figure, why she won three general elections and was in power for 11 and a half years.’ In February 1981, Michael Foot led Lady Thatcher by 16 points, but he went down to a crushing defeat in 1983. Praise: Lord Tebbit (left) spoke in support of her leadership, while Conor Burns MP (right) said she 'took a view that to do things that were right did entail unpopularity until people saw that what you were doing was working' And at the height of the poll tax furore in April 1990, Labour had a 23 per cent lead, but went on to lose the 1992 election. Mr Burns also illustrated Lady Thatcher’s uncompromising view of the Coalition, explaining: ‘On one occasion, one colleague said to her, “Of course Lady Thatcher, we’ve gone into coalition with the Liberal Democrats”. 'She sort of took a view that to do things that were right did entail unpopularity until people saw that what you were doing was working' Conor Burns, Tory MP who visited Lady Thatcher weekly . ‘And she looked at him and raised her index finger and jabbed it at him and said: “I have not gone into coalition with the Liberal Democrats”.’ ‘She wanted to see a stand-alone Conservative government. She was a tribal Conservative to her fingertips.’ Mr Burns insisted she believed only the Conservative Party, not UKIP, could deliver the necessary changes in Europe. ‘Margaret Thatcher was a Conservative all her career and died a Conservative,’ he said. ‘She wanted the Conservative party to thrive. ‘Now that doesn’t mean that she didn’t have regard for those who have sympathy for UKIP, but she understood that only the Conservative party is the big enough vehicle to deliver the change that she would want to see in Europe and in Britain.’ Support: London Mayor Boris Johnson also suggested that Lady Thatcher towered above current political leaders, saying: 'Her memory will live long after the world has forgotten the grey suits of today¿s politics' Lady Thatcher – whom friends say had periods of lucidity, even though her short-term memory was badly affected by a series of small strokes in her final years – was broadly critical of modern politicians, he added. And he said if she were in charge now, she would be ‘much more honest about the state of Britain’s finances, she’d be pointing out the debt as well as the deficit’. 'She believed in freedom, she believed in free enterprise. She believed that the British people should be liberated from decades of socialism. That’s what drove her. Not a headline in tomorrow’s newspapers. She wasn’t a follower of focus groups' Sir Gerald Howarth, ex-defence minister . Former defence minister Sir Gerald Howarth is chairman of Conservative Way Forward, a group founded in 1991 to preserve the legacy of Lady Thatcher. He said: ‘She believed in freedom, she believed in free enterprise. She believed that the British people should be liberated from decades of socialism. ‘That’s what drove her. Not a headline in tomorrow’s newspapers. She wasn’t a follower of focus groups. ‘She had those principles by which she stuck and thank God she did, because Britain was a better place as a result. She was a salvation of the nation.’ Lord Tebbit, Lady Thatcher’s most successful party chairman, said: ‘Would that there was somebody like her to lead us again now.’ Riots: At the height of the poll tax furore in April 1990, Labour had a 23 per cent lead, but went on to lose the 1992 election . London Mayor Boris Johnson also suggested that Lady Thatcher towered above current political leaders, saying: ‘Her memory will live long after the world has forgotten the grey suits of today’s politics.’ Former defence secretary Dr Liam Fox, . another close friend of Lady Thatcher, said that under her the . Conservative party ‘not only felt self-confident but was infused with a . sense of moral purpose’. 'Would that there was somebody like her to lead us again now' Lord Tebbit, Lady Thatcher’s most successful party chairman . He added: ‘She would have been humbled by the tributes paid to her today, however richly deserved. She never wanted to be popular but was always keen to be respected.’ In a piece for the ConservativeHome website, Environment Secretary Owen Paterson  wrote: ‘She picked up a country which had lost its confidence and ambition. ‘She left a country holding its own and walking tall. The legacy she leaves our party, our country and the world is a remarkable one. We owe it to her to build on this.’ And former health secretary Alan Milburn, an ardent Blairite, admitted New Labour would not have existed without her, adding: ‘Tony Blair probably wouldn’t have existed in the way that he did as a New Labour leader unless Mrs Thatcher had changed the political landscape in the way that she did.’ MAILONLINE & DAILY MAIL CAMPAIGN: HOW TO MAKE YOUR VOICE HEARD .

"iPhone owners are vainer and spend more on clothes and grooming than those who have BlackBerrys and Android phones, new research claims. BlackBerry owners earn the most and are more likely to have long-term relationships, while people with Android handsets have the best manners and are handy in the kitchen. The study, commissioned by TalkTalk Mobile,  surveyed 2,000 owners of the three major smartphone brands to determine whether the choice of handset was an extension of their personality.

"Sportsmail takes a look at 10 things we have learned from an entertaining weekend of Premier League fixtures, as well as intriguing statistics from the Football League. 1. Manchester City aren’t afraid to leave a foot in during big games – no side this weekend committed more fouls than the 15 that City were penalised for in the Manchester derby. This season Manuel Pellegrini’s team have given away 16 fouls against Chelsea and 15 at Arsenal – but only six each in the matches when they were cruising to victory against Aston Villa and Hull. Manchester City captain Vincent Kompany puts in  a crunching challenge on James Wilson . 2. Local lad Ryan Mason is emerging as Tottenham’s key midfield man ahead of players who cost the club millions. The 23-year-old, who made his Spurs debut six years ago but then seemed to spend his life on loan, has started the last five Premier League games and was a big influence in the win at Aston Villa. His part in Christian Benteke’s dismissal grabbed the headlines, but on the ball he was excellent – across the Premier League weekend only Yaya Toure, Cesc Fabregas and Ross Barkley played more accurate attacking passes than his 45. Ryan Mason has been given a new lease of life by Maurico Pochettino at Tottenham . 3. West Ham’s work rate, so terrific beating Manchester City, dropped as they went two goals down at Stoke before a Stewart Downing inspired recovery earned a point. Sam Allardyce had talked about the need to maintain the competitive attitude, but the message obviously didn’t entirely get through. When Big Sam checks his stats he’ll find his team ran a collective two miles less at the Britannia Stadium than they managed at Upton Park a week earlier – and the number of sprints dropped by 6.4 per cent from 533 to 499. Stewart Downing has been one of West Ham's star performers this season . Sam Alladyce's West Ham came back from 2-0 to salvage a point on Saturday against Stoke . 4. Ronald Koeman is making a nonsense of the modern theory that players can’t perform at high intensity in two games a week. The Southampton boss made just two changes at Hull from the side that had won 3-2 at Stoke in the Capital One Cup. He also kept nine of his starting line-up to beat QPR after winning at Arsenal in the last round of the competition, and picked eight of the players who knocked Millwall out in round one for the 3-1 win at West Ham a few days later. Ronald Koeman has had a brilliant start to life as manager of Southampton . 5. Dejan Lovren was supposed to be the hard man who would beef up Liverpool’s defence but so far has failed to make the big difference Brendan Rodgers was hoping for. After losing at Newcastle the Reds have conceded two more goals than they did in the first ten games last season. Match of the Day highlighted how 25-year-old Croatian international Lovren pulled out of a crucial 50-50 challenge late in the game. He won only two tackles in the 90 minutes, and this season has come out on top in just 72 per cent of his tackles, compared to 82.6 per cent when he was at Southampton last season. Dejan Lovren has flattered to deceive since signing for Liverpool from Southampton for £20million . 6. Burnley goalkeeper Tom Heaton played for England at every age group from Under 16 to Under 21 during his days as a Manchester United player. Now aged 28, playing behind a team that’s getting battered in the Premier League is giving him a chance to remind everybody of the potential he once showed. Heaton made eight saves at Arsenal – more than any other keeper during Saturday’s games – although he still found himself picking the ball out of the net three times. Tom Heaton was in inspired form for struggling Burnley at Arsenal on Saturday . 7. Blackburn’s Corry Evans, the younger brother of Manchester United defender Jonny, is starting to have a severe problem with his discipline. The 24-year-old Northern Ireland international midfielder picked up his SEVENTH booking of the season in the 3-1 win over Reading. That’s already three more yellow cards than he was shown in the whole of last season. 8. Sheffield Wednesday manager Stuart Gray needs to do something to stop his team throwing away points in games they have been leading. The Owls dominated at Charlton with former Everton star Royston Drenthe starring but conceded an equaliser with 20 minutes left. It’s the fourth time they’ve failed to see out a game from a winning position this season – and the eight points lost would have been enough to put Gray’s side second in the table. Sheffield Wednesday manager Stuart Gray looks on frustrated during the Owls defeat to Charlton . 9. Most managers like to pick one goalkeeper and stick with him, but Yeovil’s Gary Johnson turned to his FOURTH of the season to fight for the 0-0 draw at Chesterfield which gave him hope of getting out of the League One relegation zone. Jed Steer’s arrival on loan from Aston Villa – together with the influence of 20-year-old Fulham defender Stephen Arthurworrey – kept the division’s top scorer Eoin Doyle at bay. Johnson, 59 and a legend at Huish after leading the club into the Football League in his first spell in charge, and then to the Championship in his second, had previously used and discarded Chris Weale, Jake Kean and Artur Krysiak. Gary Johnson has tinkered around with the No 1 goalkeeper slot at Yeovil this season . 10. Portsmouth manager Andy Awford could do with bottling some of the spirit his side show at Fratton Park and taking it with him on the road. The 3-0 romp over Carlisle in front of more than 15,000 fans put his side two points off the play-off places and means they have lost only once in front of their home crowd this season. But that’s in stark contrast to the away record – since winning at Oxford at the end of August they have picked up just two points on their travels from six matches. Andy Awford's Portsmouth side have impressed at home but not so much on the road this season .","Ronald Koeman has proved with the success he has achieved at Southampton that players can play at high intensity twice a week .

"The cold-blooded murder of Colombian defender Andres Escobar after he scored an own goal against the United States in the 1994 World Cup ripped a nation's love of football to shreds. Now, one of the biggest matches in Colombia's history – a quarter-final against hosts Brazil – is being prepared for to the backdrop of one of their most shocking moments, July 2 marking 20 years to the day that Escobar was shot in his hometown Medellin. A country tipped by Pele to win that USA '94 World Cup following their 5-0 drubbing of Argentina in qualifying was divided by violence and drug lords but united by the wonderful game. Football and criminality were intrinsically linked. Gone but not forgotten: Colombia defender Andres Escobar, pictured here during the 1994 World Cup, was murdered after returning from the tournament . Horror moment: Escobar diverted the ball beyond his own goalkeeper Oscar Cordoba during a defeat to hosts the USA in Los Angeles . VIDEO Colombians pay tribute to Escobar . Infamous drug cartel leader Pablo Escobar, no relation to Andres, had a fierce passion for the game. Escobar, once considered the richest criminal in the world, invested large chunks of his billions into Colombian football and would fly global superstars to play in friendlies at his ranch. After he handed himself into the authorities in 1991, members of the national team would visit him in the private prison he had built in negotiating his capture. But he was killed in 1993 and was not alive to see the the events a year later which devastated the country. Their side was considered a Golden Generation – Andres Escobar joined by Carlos Valderrama, Faustino Asprilla, René Higuita and Freddy Rincón – and had lost just once in 26 matches leading up to the tournament. But they started the group stage with a surprise 3-1 defeat to Romania and it all began to unravel. The team received death threats and some didn't want to continue. They played on, however, and faced the hosts next. It was perhaps a fatal decision in Escobar's case. In the 35th minute, he stretched to cut out a John Harkes cross and sent the ball trickling into his own net. The match ended in a 2-1 defeat, which effectively sent them out of the tournament, a result met with even more disbelief than the first game. Down and out: Escobar sits on the turf after scoring an own goal which helped eliminate his side from the World Cup at the group stage . Defiant: Colombia fans call for peace after the senseless murder of their star defender in Medellin . They won their last group match against Switzerland but it was not enough to progress and Escobar returned home to Medellin. Against the advice of friends he ventured out into the city, where he had always been treated as a star. But when he was split from companions in a nightclub and returned to his car, he was shot six times in the back. Escobar had made plans to marry fiancée Pamela Cascardo and they were due to start a family. It is also thought he was set to sign a contract at AC Milan and move to Italy. Many thought he would go on to become one of the world's best defenders. When he was buried in Medellin, 120,000 people lined the streets. Since 1998, Colombia have not qualified for a World Cup. Asprilla and Valderrama no longer wanted to play for the national team after what happened. Defender Chonta Herrera had a nervous breakdown. All smiles: James Rodriguez (centre) has helped the current Colombia team reach the quarter-finals in Brazil . Leading the way: Manager Jose Pekerman and his team have helped Colombia fall in love with football again . A generation initially inspired by their captain Escobar – known as El Caballero del Futbol or 'the gentleman of football' – was suddenly repelled from the game by his brutal murder. The reasons behind it remain unknown. Medellin police speculated at the time that it could have been because of an argument about the own goal. Some claim it was linked to huge betting losses sustained by criminal gangs, while others insist it was just another act of violence that was indicative of the time. Humberto Castro Muñoz confessed to the murder and was sentenced to 43 years in prison, serving just 11. Two former employees of Pablo Escobar, the Gallón brothers, were acquitted. Since then, the country has been rebuilding, attempting to cleanse the bad and paint a new picture in their hero Andres Escobar's image. Like a fiery yellow phoenix the national team has finally emerged from the flames in his World Cup. A nation is in love with football again.","Escobar was shot and killed in Medellin after returning from the World Cup .

"The month of November may seem like a long way away - but preparation for the Poppy Appeal is already well under way. Every year 155 miles (250km) of red paper is produced in Burneside, Cumbria, which is then turned into more than 50million remembrance poppies. Specialist materials group James Cropper has been producing the biodegradable paper since 1978, when the Royal British Legion stopped using fabric. Here we go: Dave Watson, chief operating officer of materials group James Cropper, and ex-Navy serviceman David Horsman (right) pour the dye into the blender . Strong colour: Red dye is added to paper stock in Burneside, Cumbria, to help create the red paper which makes the Royal British Legion poppies . Huge operation: The coloured paper is cut into smaller rolls at the James Cropper paper making factory at Burneside, near Kendal, Cumbria . The firm, overseen by the Cropper family's sixth generation, has taken colour samples from real poppy petals to make the paper close to the real thing. David Horsman, a former weapons engineer and ships diver in the Royal Navy, was invited to symbolically kick-start the production process last week. This year holds special significance for . the appeal as the world marks the 100th anniversary of the start of the . First World War in 1914. Phil Wild, chief executive of James Cropper, said: ‘Although we are involved each year in the production of papers for remembrance poppies, we don't take it for granted what the poppy means to so many families and the country as a whole. ‘Everyone at both James Cropper Paper and Technical Fibre Products are proud to be able to arrange this special gesture of remembrance and support for the Poppy Appeal and are grateful to Mr Horsman for his service, fundraising contributions and time to mark the occasion with us.’ Mr Horsman saw the concentrated red colourant gradually turn the swirling container of paper pulp deep crimson, helping to celebrate and raise-awareness of the Royal British Legion's Poppy Appeal. Red all over: The paper 'stock' being poured into a tank and being mixed with red dye. Every year about 155 miles (250km) of red paper is produced in Cumbria . Preparations: The wet coloured paper passes through rollers ready to be dried. This year is the 100th anniversary of the start of the First World War. Coloured paper is cut into smaller rolls: Specialist materials group James Cropper has been producing the biodegradable paper since 1978 . After serving on vessels including HMS Liverpool from 1979 to 1987, Mr Horsman called on the help of the Royal British Legion for financial assistance. 'There is more to this iconic emblem than at first meets the eye - the paper colour does not run in the rain or rub off onto clothing, it retains its vibrant colour and holds its shape' Dave Watson, James Cropper . Now a successful businessman, he gives thanks for the support offered to him by giving his time as a Poppy Appeal organiser. Mr Horseman said: ‘Being an ex-servicemen, I have been overwhelmed by fact that I have started off production of poppies that will go absolutely everywhere. It really has not sunk in yet. 'The Royal British Legion really helped me get on my feet when I left the Navy. The biggest thing they did was to help me set up my own business.’ Every week the Royal British Legion spends around £1.7million on the welfare of ex-service personnel. Marcus Hawthorn, area manager for Cumbria at the Royal British Legion, said: ‘It's a pleasure to witness the start of the poppy journey at James Cropper. In charge: The company is overseen by the sixth generation of the Cropper family, chairman Mark Cropper (pictured) Former Navy serviceman David Horsman with a poppy (left), and a plaque at the factory with the names of employees killed in the First and Second World Wars (right) Going back: The late James Winstanley Cropper (right) welcoming The Queen (left) to Kendal in 1956. He was the great-grandfather of current chairman Mark Cropper . ‘The red paper will be transformed into millions of poppies, which enables the Legion to continue providing practical help and support to the whole Armed Forces community. ‘In this poignant year which marks the centenary of the First World War we encourage the nation to reflect on the sacrifices made by all servicemen and women who fought for the freedom we enjoy today.’ 'Although we are involved each year in the production of papers for remembrance poppies, we don't take it for granted what the poppy means to so many families and the country as a whole' Phil Wild, James Cropper . From Cumbria, the paper makes a 300-mile trip to Kent. Poppy Factories produce more than 50million remembrance poppies, 500,000 poppies of other types, 5million remembrance petals, 100,000 wreaths and sprays, 750,000 remembrance crosses and other remembrance items. Dave Watson, James Cropper chief operations officer, said: ‘We are very proud of our longstanding involvement in the production of the paper poppy. 'It must be said that there is more to this iconic emblem than at first meets the eye - the paper colour does not run in the rain or rub off onto clothing, it retains its vibrant colour and holds its shape. ‘The diverse technical chemistry required to achieve this ensures the paper poppy is worn with confidence the world over as a symbol of respect and remembrance.’","Every year red paper is produced in Burneside, Cumbria, then turned into remembrance poppies .

"Andy Cannon, 23, (pictured with girlfriend Redeana Hammill) was sexually abused by his adoptive gay parents but his complaints to social workers were ignored . A boy sexually abused by his adoptive father and his gay partner was labelled an ‘unruly child’ by social workers who ignored his complaints for years, a damning report has revealed. They sent Andy Cannon, now 23, back to the couple’s home despite his protests of abuse, praising the gay man who adopted him as a ‘very caring parent’. The report accuses Wakefield social services, in Yorkshire, of ‘folly and gross misjudgment’. Mr Cannon, who was wrongly diagnosed with mental disorders and prescribed anti-psychotic drugs, believes he would have been listened to sooner if his adoptive father wasn’t gay. The case ended last year, after half a decade of legal wrangling, when a court ordered a £25,000 compensation payment to Mr Cannon. Mr Cannon, who now has two children with girlfriend Redeana Hammill, was adopted by David Cannon in 1997. He and his mother, Elaine Moss, repeatedly complained to social workers about the abuse. In 2004, he was returned to Cannon’s care nine days after running away and making a complaint about him. Cannon, 54, and his 31-year-old partner John Scarfe were each jailed for 30 months in May 2006 for inciting sexual activity with a child. Mr Cannon said: ‘I believe if my adoptive dad was in a heterosexual relationship then my complaints would have been listened to earlier. ‘It seems the council didn’t want to be seen as victimising gay people – they would rather look politically correct and let them get away with it to avoid any repercussions. Jailed: David Cannon was convicted for 30 months for inciting sexual activity with a child . Guilty: David Cannon's partner John Scarfe was also jailed for abusing Andy Cannon . ‘The council should have been there to prevent this from happening but they would rather just sweep it under the carpet.’ The report, conducted for Dewsbury County Court by a child welfare specialist, detailed how Cannon was allowed to adopt the boy, despite his mother accusing him of abuse at the time. A social worker failed to report the allegations to a family court and instead called Cannon ‘a very caring parent who considered his children’s needs’. Mr Cannon, who has waived his right to anonymity, said: ‘When I told social workers they didn’t believe me. When I got home from school, if my dad was wound up by something I would pay for it with a beating. Then later on he would sexually abuse me. ‘I never really had nightmares because I completely switched off from it all – although I get nightmares now. I let it happen and thought that one of two things would happen. Either I’d manage to get away or they’d kill me.’ Wakefield council has apologised to Mr Cannon. A spokesman said: ‘We are working with Andy to make sure that in making this apology we deal with all the concerns he has raised.’","Andy Cannon, 23, was sexually abused by his gay adoptive parents .

"Dead Libyan dictator Colonel Muammar Gaddafi raped hundreds of women during his years in power, and even kept a harem of sex slaves locked in the basement of his home, his former security chief has revealed. Mansour Daw, who stayed loyal to the tyrant until his downfall and subsequent death in 2011, said Gadaffi's sexual appetite was so strong that an entire government department was established to source and provide him with prostitutes. Many were kept in his Tripoli compound under lock and key where the dictator could call on their services night or day. And when he travelled abroad on state affairs, he would take them along, usually disguised as bodyguards or journalists, Daw said. Sex slaves? Muammar Gadaffi (pictured) would take the women on diplomacy missions to foreign countries disguised as bodyguards . Cravings: There was even an entire government department dedicated to sourcing and providing women for Gaddafi (left) on which he would carry out his sexual cravings. His wife, Safia Farkash, is pictured right . 'It fell under the umbrella of the Department of Protocol under the direction of Nuri Mesmari, a schemer who had the gall to parade around in a general’s uniform every now and then,' Daw told journalist Annick Cojean. '[Mesmari] had the nickname ‘the general of special affairs’ so the only word that was applicable could be avoided: General of the Whores.' Daw claimed to have known nothing of the basement 'dungeon' where many of Gadaffi's favourites were held under his compound in capital Tripoli. 'I swear I never went down to that basement!' he exclaimed, revealing no further details of the conditions under which they were held. And while most generals who turned a blind eye as he carried out his depraved activities with young women - and sometimes men - those who helped feed his vast sexual appetite were quickly promoted. '[Mesmari] looked for women everywhere; that was his specialty and his primary function; he would even pick up prostitutes on the street,' added Daw. Fast track to power: And while most generals who turned a blind eye as he carried out his depraved activities, those who helped feed his vast sexual appetite were fast promoted . The women accompanied the dictator on trips to western nations including France and Spain, Daw told Cojean, an excerpt of whose book, Gaddafi's Harem, has been published in Salon.com, where they would travel under the guise of ‘committees,’ ‘delegations,’ or ‘groups of journalists'. When asked about rumours Gaddafi even forced ministers to have sex with him, Daw replied: 'It doesn’t surprise me. 'There are so many ambitious people. There were . even those who were prepared to hand over their wife or daughter in . exchange for some favour or other.' Daw himself, however, insisted Gaddafi never propositioned him or any of his relatives, even at parties hosted by the security chief. 'He wouldn’t have dared to pounce on any of my guests,' he said. 'He knew all . too well what my reaction would have been. 'But I preferred that he be . somewhere else. Had he come he would surely have been accompanied by his . whores, always on the lookout, and that terrified me.' Gaddafi died during the NATO-backed . uprising in Libya on October 20 2011 when he was shot after being . taken prisoner by rebels. He was 69. Meanwhile, Daw is currently being held in a high-security prison in Libya where he awaits trial for war crimes.","Mansour Daw stayed loyal to the tyrant until his downfall and death in 2011 .

"TV presenter Gabby Logan was drawn into the tax-avoidance scandal yesterday after it emerged she invested in the same tax shelter as Take That. The sports pundit, who is part of the BBC’s football World Cup presenting team, poured her money into a £12.3million scheme designed to hide earnings from the tax man. The 41-year-old is one of a host of stars – including singer Gary Barlow and several of his Take That bandmates – who have invested £336million in the controversial Icebreaker Management fund. Gabby Logan, left, invested money in the controversial Icebreaker scheme which was used by Gary Barlow, right . Earlier this month, a tax judge ruled Icebreaker was not a genuine investment scheme and had been set up solely to allow the super-rich to claim income tax relief. The ruling means Mrs Logan and the other investors could now be forced to pay back millions to HMRC. It is not known exactly how much money Mrs Logan poured into the scheme. According to the Mirror, she joined an Icebreaker partnership called Ivancroft in 2008. Although it purported to be a creative industries investment scheme, Ivancroft made a loss of £11.7million. Its real purpose was to allow its members to offset their investments against the tax they owed on their other earnings. Barllow, right, and band mates Mark Owen, left, and Howard Donald, centre, also put money into the controversial scheme . It is thought Barlow, 43, his bandmates Howard Donald, 46, Mark Owen, 42, and their manager Jonathan Wild could be forced to pay £20million back HMRC. They put £66million into several Icebreaker partnerships, reportedly allowing them to shelter around £63million from the taxman. Other well-known names who have invested in Icebreaker include retired Olympic hurdler Colin Jackson, 47, former England football manager Terry Venables, 71, and businessman Nick Wheeler, who is the founder of Charles Tyrwhitt shirts. It is thought some of the investors have told HMRC they were misled into joining Icebreaker, and did not realise it was a tax avoidance scheme. Both Jackson and Venables have insisted their tax affairs are in order and have denied they joined Icebreaker to avoid tax. Couple: Gabby, right, is married to former Scotland rugby international Kenny Logan, left . However, judge Colin Bishopp ruled Icebreaker ‘is, and was known and understood by all concerned to be, a tax avoidance scheme.’ Prime Minister David Cameron has said he is ‘opposed to all aggressive tax avoidance’ but refused to join calls for Barlow to be stripped of his OBE. Mrs Logan’s spokesman did not respond to a request for comment yesterday. A year before joining Ivancroft the mother-of-two – who is married to former Scotland rugby player Kenny Logan - gave an interview about her finances. Asked about saving for retirement, she said: ‘Property and the odd speculative investment. As well as property and Isas, I have occasionally bought shares and invested in businesses.’ The star lives in a £3.8million seven-bedroom house in High Wycombe, Bucks.","TV presenter Gabby Logan invested in the Icebreaker Management fund .

"Spends £1k a month on chauffeurs and taxis, and £600 at the hair salon . Most twentysomethings have long been dropped from their parents' pocket money payroll. But one - who some are calling the most spoiled woman in Britain - still receives a massive £10,000 payout each month from her mother - and that's just the tip of the iceberg. Gina Rio, 23, who lives in a suite at the five star Savoy hotel despite owning a house in London's King's Cross, is handed the money by her mother, Theresa, who took over the monthly payments after Gina fell out with her father, a successful businessman, in 2003 and he stopped the £20,000 allowance he used to provide. Spoilt: Gina Rio poses with her various shopping bags at the Savoy hotel where she is staying while her house is refurbished . Gina, whose parents split when she was aged 14 after her father had an affair, spends the generous allowance living the life of a princess. She shops at designer stores, naming Louis Vuitton, Lanvin and Christian Louboutin as some of her favourite shops, and she eats lavish meals at London's . finest restaurants, claiming on Twitter that she plans to dine exclusively at Michelin-starred establishments. And she buys more designer goods than she could wear in a lifetime, including . over 300 pairs of designer shoes and 70 designer handbags, one of which, . a Hermes bag that she ordered her father to buy after she discovered he had . bought a similar one for his mistress, cost £20,000. Gina, seen here posing with some of her many pairs of designer shoes at the Savoy, admits she sees her parents generosity as proof of their love for her . She also spends an extravagant amount on being chauffeured around in private cars and taxis, the bill for which can exceed a staggering £1,000 a month, and pampers herself in the hairdresser on a regular basis - often spending £600 each month to keep her locks glossy. As if the allowance wasn’t enough, Gina’s parents have also showered her with gifts over the years. Her father, who owns a successful construction company, spent £10,000 on a 16th birthday party for Gina, while her mother recently gave her a white Mercedes SLK convertible, worth about £30,000. While Gina doesn’t solely rely on her parents money - she earns £2,000 a month as a personal stylist - she has shockingly not managed to save a penny of the mini fortune lavished on her. The 23-year-old, who trained at Sylvia Young Theatre School, spent an eye-watering £50,000 in two days last month on clubbing and shopping for luxury clothes, after taking her father's credit card without his permission. 'My dad wasn't happy,' Gina's brother Sebastian says, 'but he just shrugged it off.' Gina compares herself to socialite and millionairess Tamara Ecclestone, and admits she often has no idea how much she spends on luxuries such as socialising, hair and beauty. Living the high life: Gina, 23, has been lavished with money and luxury gifts since the day she was born . Competition: 'When I found out that my dad bought his mistress a Hermes handbag, I wanted to have one that was bigger and better' 5 star lifestyle: Gina is currently living at the Savoy, and clearly taking advantage of the restaurants, often tweeting pictures of her opulent meals . ‘It’s really bad - I don’t even know how much I spend sometimes.’ Gina often posts about  her lavish lifestyle on Twitter, tweeting on 21st December ‘Shopping in Knightsbridge with mummy! Love her, and her cards!’ and treating her over 25,000 followers to daily reminders of her extravagant purchases and indulgent restaurant meals. In one tweet she declares: ‘I decided I'm strictly eating at michelin star restaurants and 5* places, i'm tired of trying to be normal and eating at these other places!' Gina posted this picture of her receiving a £30,000 white Mercedes SLK convertible- tied with a ribbon. The car was a gift from her mother who also provides Gina with her allowance . On her blog, where readers can learn how to copy her lavish lifestyle; she lists Harrods, Bond street, exclusive jewelers Asprey and Cartier, Selfridges department store as personal shopping favourites. While it might be easy to dismiss Gina as simply a spoilt brat, she is the first to admit she is using money as a substitute for her parents' love. Devastated when her father had an affair and left the family for another woman, Gina, then aged 14, was given substantial handouts from him until, at age 17, she demanded an allowance of £20,000 a month. ‘I know I’m spoiled, but I need my parents to buy me things to prove they love me,' she says. 'I think the most expensive item was a Hermes handbag which cost £20,000. This blue Hermes bag costs £20,000, and Gina owns around 70 more designer bags . 'When I found out that he'd bought his mistress a Hermes handbag, I wanted to have one that was bigger and better. 'I wanted him to prove that he loved me more than her - because she's horrid - she's horrid. 'He's my dad at the end of the day and I'm always going to love him, but he's chosen his new family over me.' Gina fell out with her father over his new love in 2003 and he cut off her £20,000 a month, leaving Gina threatened with a normal life devoid of the countless luxuries to which she had become accustomed. Luckily her mother Theresa stepped in to save her daughters extravagant way of life, offering £10,000 monthly to keep her in taxis and blowdries. When Gina goes out, she lets her boyfriend - the 23-year-old rapper Ecksell - pick up the tab. 'I love my Cristal champagne and bellini cocktails,' she said. 'I have no idea how much it costs - hundreds maybe. When my boyfriend and I go clubbing, he goes crazy. 'Once he spent £25,000 in one night. Afterwards I told him that he might as well spend that on me. 'I could not imagine life without any money. Not being able to pay to have my hair done would be the worst thing ever. 'I always get what I want - I've never gone without. 'I've never caught the Tube or a bus. I would never go on public transport. It would be terrifying.' Unlike most girls her age, Gina has never set foot in Primark. She said: 'I've driven past but I don't think I'd like it.' Meanwhile Gina has carefully vetted all her suitors. She said: 'I could never date someone who is poor. That would be the worst thing that could ever happen to me. 'When I met my boyfriend he told me he was signed to Warner Bros to impress me, but he really wasn't. 'Then I found out that his dad owns a brand of sauce sold in Harrods, I was pretty impressed and I knew his family would have a lot of money. Parental love: Gina, seen here at age 18 months, with her mother, who now provides her with £10,000 after Gina fell out with her father Paul . Gina, who admires socialite Tamara Ecclestone, was in Dizzee Rascal's 'Come Dance With Me' video in her swimsuit, but says her dream lies not in the world of Hip Hop, but in opening a beauty spa . She said: 'I want my kids to have a nice life like me. When you've got money everything is a lot easier. 'But I don't want my kids growing up and taking money for granted like I used to. 'When my allowance was cut, I realised that that I had to cut back too. Before I used to buy things for the sake of it. Now I only buy clothes that I really like.' Pampered feet: Growing up Gina had an allowance of £20,000 a month and was bought thousands of pounds worth of designer clothes, she now owns over 300 pairs of designer shoes . 'I have no concept of money': Gina poses with her different bags at the Savoy hotel . However, Gina claims her brother Sebastian, 38, is even more spoilt than her. She said: 'People think that I'm spoilt, but he is on a different level, literally. Anything he asks for, he gets without any hesitation. 'He's wasted so much of my parent's money on his failed business ideas. Once they gave him £200,000 for a Caribbean restaurant that never went anywhere.' In 2008 Gina performed in the Dizzee Rascal's 'Come Dance With Me' music video wearing a swimsuit. Extreme views: Gina, currently residing at the 5 star Savoy hotel (right) says that dating someone poor would be 'the worst thing that ever happened to her' She is currently living at the Savoy while her house in King's Cross is refurbished. The five-bed house will have a walk in wardrobe covering the entire top floor, a swimming pool and jacuzzi and a home cinema. Gina said: 'My mum bought the house for me ages ago - I reckon it must have cost at least a million.' Meanwhile father Paul is picking up the tab at the Savoy - a bill costing thousands of pounds. Out of touch: Gina claims that the drop in allowance from £20,000 to £10,000 a month caused her to 'cut back' on her spending . Mum Theresa has no problem with Gina excessive spending. She says: 'I tell Gina that I am proud of her and everything she gets she deserves. Why have money if you can't enjoy it?' Looking forward, Gina says she is hoping to emulate her idol Tamara Ecclestone. 'I like Tamara - she's pretty and seems nice. Of course, she wants for nothing - and sometimes I think I'm just as bad as her. 'I'd like to start my own business - something like a beauty spa.

"A mysterious new disease . has left scores of people in Asia and some in the U.S. with AIDS-like . symptoms even though they are not infected with HIV. The patients' immune systems become damaged, leaving them . unable to fend off germs as healthy people do. What triggers this is unknown . but the disease does not seem to be contagious. It appears to be another kind of acquired immune deficiency that is . not inherited and occurs in adults. However it doesn't spread the way AIDs does through . a virus, said Dr Sarah Browne, a scientist at the National Institute of Allergy . and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), which is part of the National Institute of Health. Dr Sarah K. Browne, right, talks with patient Kim Nguyen at the National Institute of Health. Researchers have identified a mysterious new disease with AIDS-like symptoms even though they are not infected with HIV . She helped lead the study with researchers in Thailand and . Taiwan where most of the cases have been found since 2004. Their report is in . Thursday's New England Journal of Medicine. 'This is absolutely fascinating. I've seen probably at least . three patients in the last 10 years or so' who might have had this, said Dr. Dennis Maki, an infectious disease specialist at the University of Wisconsin in . Madison. It's still possible that an infection of some sort could . trigger the disease, even though the disease itself doesn't seem to spread . person-to-person, he said. The disease develops around age 50 on average but does not . run in families, which makes it unlikely that a single gene is responsible, . Browne said. Some patients have died of overwhelming infections, including some . Asians now living in the U.S., although Browne could not estimate how many. Kim Nguyen, 62, a seamstress from Vietnam who has lived in . Tennessee since 1975, was gravely ill when she sought help for a persistent . fever, infections throughout her bones and other bizarre symptoms in 2009. She . had been sick off and on for several years and had visited Vietnam in 1995 and . again in early 2009. Research from the NIAID, part of the National Institute of Health (pictured), reveals the disease causes patients' immune systems to become damaged, leaving them unable to fend off germs. What triggers this isn't known . 'She was wasting away from this systemic infection' that at . first seemed like tuberculosis but wasn't, said Dr Carlton Hays Jr., a family . physician at the Jackson Clinic in Jackson, Tennessee. 'She's a small woman to begin . with, but when I first saw her, her weight was 91 pounds, and she lost down to . 69 pounds.' Nguyen (pronounced 'when') was referred to specialists at . the National Institutes of Health who had been tracking similar cases. She spent . nearly a year at an NIH hospital in Bethesda, Maryland, and is there now for . monitoring and further treatment. 'I feel great now,' she said on Wednesday. But when she was . sick, 'I felt dizzy, headaches, almost fell down,' she said. 'I could not eat . anything.' AIDS is a specific disease, and it stands for acquired . immune deficiency syndrome. That means the immune system becomes impaired during . someone's lifetime, rather than from inherited gene defects like the 'bubble . babies' who are born unable to fight off germs. The virus that causes AIDS - HIV - destroys T-cells, key . soldiers of the immune system that fight germs. The new disease doesn't affect . those cells, but causes a different kind of damage. Browne's study of more than . 200 people in Taiwan and Thailand found that most of those with the disease make . substances called auto-antibodies that block interferon-gamma, a chemical signal . that helps the body clear infections. Blocking that signal leaves people like those with AIDS - . vulnerable to viruses, fungal infections and parasites, but especially . micobacteria, a group of germs similar to tuberculosis that can cause severe . lung damage. Researchers are calling this new disease an 'adult-onset' immunodeficiency syndrome because it develops later in life and they don't know . why or how. 'Fundamentally, we do not know what's causing them to make . these antibodies,' Browne said. Antibiotics aren't always effective, so doctors have tried a . variety of other approaches, including a cancer drug that helps suppress . production of antibodies. The disease quiets in some patients once the . infections are tamed, but the faulty immune system is likely a chronic . condition, researchers believe. The fact that nearly all the patients so far have been Asian . or Asian-born people living elsewhere suggests that genetic factors and . something in the environment such as an infection may trigger the disease, . researchers conclude. The first cases turned up in 2004 and Browne's study . enrolled about 100 people in six months. 'We know there are many others out there,' including many . cases mistaken as tuberculosis in some countries, she said.","Disease has affected mostly Asian-born patients and some in U.S.

"Political heavyweight Rob Ford ensured that the rides at a new children's playground got a good workout during an official opening ceremony on Sunday. The controversial Toronto mayor, not long out of rehab for drink and drug issues, is currently attempting to rehabilitate his political career ahead of October's municipal election to determine if he remains in his job. Ford's companion for Sunday's play-date at the dinosaur-themed playground in Elms Park, Etobicoke was of course his brother and local councilor Doug Ford. Scroll down for video . Taking the strain: Political heavyweight Rob Ford and his brother, local councilor Doug Ford, attempt to roll back the years on a see-saw . Heading for a fall? The controversial Toronto mayor, right, is facing a municipal election in October to determine if he remains in his job . The roly poly brothers huffed and puffed as they attempted to roll back the years playing on the see-saw before Rob sought to show off his athletic prowess with an attempt at tackling the climbing frame. 'We will continue to create more green spaces and playgrounds. (I’m) committed to continue to fix-up our parks,' Ford told the Toronto Sun. Earlier this month, he vowed to have another 'crack' at nixing his city's land transfer tax at his first campaign debate since leaving rehab. The quip provoked raucous laughter from a spirited audience at a church in the Toronto's Scarborough district, which was split between vocal supporters and opponents of the mayor.

'I have created jobs, I have worked with youth, nobody’s worked with youth closer than I have ... folks, my record speaks for itself. It’s a record of success, success, success.' Mr Ford, 45, only returned to work a fortnight ago after spending two months at the Greenstone rehab centre in Bala, Ontario. He sought help after another video surfaced that apparently showed him smoking crack; Ford admitted last year that he had smoked crack in a 'drunken stupor' after reports of a similar video, following months of denials.

Even since returning to the mayor's office, a largely symbolic role after his powers were stripped by the city council, he has admitted that he can't guarantee that he'll never relapse. But Mr Ford's proclivity for crack, a highly addictive derivative of cocaine, seems to have had little impact on his supporters, who booed each time one of his rivals mentioned their man's drug use. Supporters dressed in 'Ford Nation' T-shirts, pins and flags heckled his political opponents and yelled in support each time he spoke on stage.

'Project after project after project, on your watch, when you’re the mayor,' he was quoted by the Toronto Star as saying. 'We know what you were doing — it wasn’t managing the taxpayers’ money!' Mr Ford's activities while in office have earned him global notoriety, something which Mr Tory commented on as candidates left the hustings last night. 'He’s a laughing stock.

"Scarred: Helena was shocked after her NHS tummy tuck left her midriff badly deformed and her looking like a man . Helena Grace could barely believe her luck when she was told she could have a tummy tuck on the NHS. After losing nine stone in just a year, thanks to a gastric bypass (also on the NHS), the 36-year-old nanny from Chesham, Bucks, had been left with large amounts of unsightly loose skin around her abdomen. Helena, who was once 21st 8lb, hoped the procedure – called an apronectomy or mini tummy tuck – would restore her self-confidence. Instead, the operation left her deformed, revolted and despairing every time she looked at her body. ‘I was so happy to finally lose weight but I was left with a lot of excess skin and it was making me miserable. So, at my yearly check-up, I asked my surgeon if anything could be done to correct it. He said he would refer me for a tummy tuck, which would get rid of the loose skin. I was really pleased when he said I could get the operation on the NHS. ‘I was referred to the Royal Free Hospital in North London and had an appointment with plastic surgeon Norbert Kang. He spent five minutes talking to me about the operation and left the rest up to his registrar [a junior doctor]. ‘Mr Kang did manage to tell me about possible risks of the surgery. He said that I would lose my belly button but it was only another scar and that I’d already have a huge scar across my stomach anyway,’ says Helena, who lives with fiance Tim, 44, a painter and decorator. ‘I didn’t like the thought of not having a belly button. It’s something that you have from birth and very much a part of you – not just another scar. ‘But when a surgeon tells you that it’s a normal part of the operation, you put your trust in him. I went along with it because I didn’t know any better. ‘He also said that I may have flaps of skin at each hip, which he called “excessive dog ears”. I assumed that this too was normal and so I consented to the surgery. I had no idea it would turn out the way it did.’ Nothing he said prepared Helena for the horrific results of the operation in February 2009. ‘When I came round, Mr Kang told me that he’d removed nearly 7lb of excess skin and was pleased with the result. ‘When I took the bandages off, I didn’t know what to expect. ‘I had never seen the results of a tummy tuck before, so if anything, I was pleased that so much skin had been removed. I had a horizontal scar from hip to hip that measured over 12 inches long and cut straight across the middle of my stomach. ‘I had, as predicted, no belly button and large flaps of skin that hung over my hips. I also had a thick pouch of skin that sagged from the centre of my stomach over my pubic bone so, to put it delicately, I looked like a man. It was very embarrassing.’ Yet Mr Kang assured her that the state her body was left in was perfectly normal. Helena was devastated. ‘People even asked me if I was going through a sex change because you could see a bulge through my clothes. I started to refuse invitations to go out – I hated the thought that people could see what a bad shape I was. My boyfriend at the time never mentioned it. ‘He knew how upset I was and was aware that it was not something he should talk about.’ Her former self: Helena on holiday with a friend before she lost the nine stone thanks to an NHS gastric bypass operation . After two years of suffering in silence, Helena decided to investigate corrective surgery – specifically tackling the pouch of flesh above her groin. ‘Mr Kang told me that he didn’t do that kind of operation. He said it would have to be done privately – and suggested the name of a surgeon, but after everything that had happened I decided I’d find my own doctor.’ She settled on cosmetic surgeon Mario Russo, who admits he was horrified by Helena’s post-operative body. ‘In all the years I’ve been practising I’ve never seen an abdomen like hers,’ he says. ‘The scar that should have been near her bikini line was high up above where her navel should be. The fact she had no belly button at all really shocked me. ‘Of course there is always a risk with this kind of surgery that you can lose a portion of the navel, but it was not acceptable that she’d been left in that state and I was really angry on her behalf.’ The corrective surgery by Mr Russo would normally have cost £15,000 – an amount Helena says she couldn’t afford. Instead, Mr Russo offered her the chance to appear in a television series that he was taking part in, which would mean she could have the surgery for free. ‘I was nervous but I didn’t feel like I had many other options,’ she says. ‘I felt so upset that the NHS surgeon seemed unconcerned by the cosmetic results of the operation. I was shocked by what Mr Russo had said but it was also something of a relief to have him confirm what I knew in my heart – that the way I looked wasn’t normal at all. I was absolutely gutted that I had been led to believe it was all OK.’ Helena underwent the five-hour corrective operation in June this year. Mr Russo says: ‘The previous procedure seemed to be very badly planned. When you perform surgery, you’re always taught that before you cut, you have to consider how you are going to close the wound. In Helena’s case, it seemed that the surgeon had cut without thinking it through.’ National Health Service: The Royal Free Hospital in Hampstead, north London, where Helena's operation was carried out . Mr Kang is a consultant plastic surgeon and honorary senior lecturer at University College, London. His research interests are listed as hand surgery and prosthetic reconstruction. It is NHS policy not to allow individual surgeons to speak to the media about specific cases. However, the Royal Free Hospitals NHS Trust gave a statement saying: ‘We are sorry to learn that Ms Grace was unhappy with the results of her operation although she has not made a formal complaint. ‘She was advised that it might not be possible to preserve her navel and it was also emphasised that following surgery, she might be unhappy with the cosmetic appearance of her abdomen. ‘Ms Grace signed a consent form indicating that she understood this information and wished to proceed. Following substantial weight loss, people may be left with excess folds of skin in the abdominal area, which can cause skin infections. ‘In order to alleviate these problems, NHS patients may be offered an apronectomy. In contrast, an abdominoplasty operation is a cosmetic surgery procedure where the aim of the operation is to improve the aesthetic appearance of the abdomen, and this includes preserving the navel. The NHS does not routinely offer this operation.’ Helena simply says: ‘I didn’t have skin infections. I believed the operation would make me look better. Would he have left his wife or daughter in that state?’ There has been a huge rise in  post-obesity surgery in the past decade, linked to the increasing numbers of patients undergoing gastric banding and bypass – about 14,000 of these operations were carried out last year. As the number of operations rises, so does the number of complaints. ‘Complaints are usually due to poor outcomes,’ says Victoria Hydon, an expert in medical negligence at Moore Blatch Resolve solicitors.  ‘We have about 50 similar cases a year – split equally between the NHS and private sector – and usually the problem lies with a breakdown in communication with patient and surgeon.’ Meanwhile, Helena simply wants to get on with her life. ‘I wish that I’d never had the tummy tuck in the first place.’","After losing nine stone, Helena Grace was offered an operation to remove loose skin from her belly.

"They are marketed as being healthier than conventional cigarettes, but researchers believe people who smoke electronic cigarettes could be putting themselves at greater risk than regular smokers. People who smoke e-cigarettes may inhale higher concentrations of nicotine and of other toxins,say U.S researchers. So far little research has been carried out into using e-cigarettes, but scientists at the U.S. College of Dentistry have now set up a study to find out the health effects. Nicotine is both addictive and, in large quantities, toxic - and some of the other chemicals found in e-cigarettes are believed to be carcinogenic. Researchers say people who smoke electronic cigarettes instead of traditional ones might be absorbing higher concentrations of dangerous chemicals . Researchers at New York University say that due to the ‘frequency of puffing’ and ‘depth of inhalation’ ,e-cigarette smokers may absorb higher levels of harmful chemicals than those who smoke traditional cigarettes. Initially, e-cigarettes were seen as a healthier, tobacco-free alternative for people who were addicted to nicotine. However, health agencies have challenged this assumption since they were first marketed in around 2007. More current research has shown and they are now often smoked by people who have never smoked traditional cigarettes. In July 2013, the World Health Organization (WHO) stated that 'consumers should be strongly advised not to use' electronic cigarettes until a reputable national regulatory body has found them safe and effective. It said: 'The safety of ENDS has not been scientifically demonstrated [and] the potential risks they pose for the health of users remain undetermined. 'Furthermore, scientific testing indicates that the products vary widely in the amount of nicotine and other chemicals they deliver and there is no way for consumers to find out what is actually delivered by the product they have purchased.' More current research has shown and they are now often smoked by people who have never smoked traditional cigarettes . Dr Deepak Saxena, associate professor . of basic science and craniofacial biology, said: ‘The issue is urgent . as a recent survey conducted among students at eight U.S. colleges found . that 12 per cent of e-cig users had never smoked a conventional . cigarette.’ The U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the American Lung Association have . cautioned that e-cigarette users are unknowingly inhaling vaporised . chemicals. E-cigarettes use a heating device to vaporise nicotine and other ingredients which simulate the visual, sensory, and behavioural aspects of smoking without the combustion of tobacco. E-cigarettes employ a mechanism to heat up liquid nicotine, which turns into a vapour that smokers inhale and exhale, a process known as ‘vaping’. Each nicotine cartridge in an e-cigarette can provide 200 to 400 puffs, equivalent to two to three packs of cigarettes. ‘Due to the frequency of puffing, depth of inhalation, and length of vaping,’ says Dr Xin Li, ‘e-cig users may actually absorb higher concentrations of nicotine and other toxins than conventional tobacco smokers.’ An earlier version of this article presented the conclusions of the US College of Dentistry study. In fact, the study is still ongoing and the findings have not yet been published. We are happy to clarify this.","E-cigarettes are increasing no longer being seen as just a healthier alternative to cigarettes for people who are already addicted to nicotine .

"This colour-coded map reveals the startling difference in life expectancies across 222 of the world's countries. The map shows how people are likely to live the longest in developed countries with state-funded healthcare systems like Japan, Canada and the UK, which each have average life expectancies of over 80 years. The tiny tax haven of Monaco - with its notoriously wealthy inhabitants and compulsory state-funded health service - has the highest life expectancy at an average of 89.68 years, five years higher than anywhere else on earth, according to the CIA World Factbook. The country with the worst life expectancy is the African state of Chad at a shocking 48.69 years. Life expectancy in America ranks 51st in the CIA's table at . 78.49 years - lower than Canada (81.48), Australia (81.90), New Zealand . (80.71), Japan (83.91), the UK (80.17) and much of Europe. How long will you live? This colour coded map shows the life expectancy in 222 of the world's nations. Nations shaded dark blue are those where people are expected to live to over 80, and they include most of the developed countries which have compulsory state-funded healthcare like the most of the countries of Western Europe, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Israel, Jordan and Japan. With the exception of Afghanistan, the countries with the lowest life expectancies are all in sub-Saharan Africa. Inhabitants of Afghanistan, Swaziland, South Africa, Guinea-Bissau and Chad are not expected to reach 50 . Of the top five longest-living . nations the only large country is Japan, with the . rest being city states (see box). Life expectancy levels in South America and generally 10 years lower than those in North America. People are likely to live the shortest in sub-Saharan Africa, with no country in that vast region having an average life expectancy of over 60. Only a few Asian countries, including Afghanistan (49.72) and a . couple of Caribbean nations, have such similarly short life expectancies compared with Africa. The worst countries to live in if you want to reach old age are Afghanistan (49.72), Swaziland (49.42), South Africa (49.41) Guinea-Bissau (49.11) and Chad (48.69), whose people are generally expected to die before they even reach middle age. The map, created by io9.com, shows the average life expectancy for both men and women. The CIA's individual breakdown confirms that women on average live longer than men. Life expectancy for a woman in Monaco is 93.77 years compared with that of a man at 85.74 years. In Chad life expectancy for men is only 47.61 years while women are expected to live slightly longer to 49.82 years. American men live 76.05 years on average while women in the United States live to 81.05 years. In the United Kingdom the life expectancy of men is 78.05 years while it is 82.4 years for women. While the United States has consistently fallen in the rank of world nations over the last 50 years, the average life expectancy has risen from 69.8 years in 1960 to 78.49 today. And while Chad's figure of 48.69 today is shockingly low, in 1960 Afghanistan had the world's lowest life expectancy at 31.3 years. Where do you live?

"Sometimes moving is just too much effort. A sleepy baby panda at a Chinese panda sanctuary in Sichuan Province appears to be looking for some affection from its keeper as it sits in a tree, refusing to move. Despite the best attempts of the breeder to coax the animal down, the panda refuses to move, instead staying stock still, lying across a branch. Nap time: Sleepy baby panda does not want to leave its tree . Reluctant to be woken, the dangling panda takes a lot of stirring to awaken it from its nap and even then doesn't seem in any hurry to clamber down. The breeder strokes the panda awake and tries to encourage it down from the tree at the sanctuary in Sichuan Province, which is popular with tourists wanting to get up close to the endangered animals.

Although it would be able to climb down the tree itself, the panda stretches out its furry paws to the sanctuary worker, as if asking for a hug.

"Jose Mourinho wanted to get his point across. Leaning against a wall not far from Chelsea’s dressing room, the topic of Nemanja Matic had arisen and Mourinho was ready to talk. ‘Please give him what he deserves,’ Mourinho implored. ‘He was signed in the most difficult market for players (January) so the second half of last season was a space of improvement and adaptation for him. At this moment, he’s a giant. Not for his size but for the way he plays. The man is a giant.’ Among the many in blue shirts who had starred during Chelsea’s commanding 2-1 victory at Anfield, from the beguiling Eden Hazard to the combative John Terry, nobody surpassed the hulking Serbian enforcer, who trampled all over Liverpool’ s ambitions. Jose Mourinho (left) has praised the impact of Nemanja Matic (right) since joining Chelsea in January . Matic (left) celebrates Chelsea pulling level against Liverpool on Sunday through a Gary Cahill (right) goal . Mourinho (above) gives his team an instruction in Chelsea's 2-1 win over Liverpool at Anfield on Saturday . Chelsea are moving relentlessly towards the title and, should they achieve their objective, it is inevitable that members of the Stamford Bridge battalion will be scoop both the PFA and FWA Player of the Year awards. Costa, of course, will command his share of the votes. Cesc Fabregas, too, for the artistry and style he has provided. Mourinho’s two major summer signings have made huge contributions to Chelsea's unblemished start. But why not Matic? He won’t take the breath away with skill, he won’t be chipping in with a bundle of goals but his importance to Chelsea in the games that matter is beyond question. Anfield didn’t bother him in the same way he never batted an eyelid at the Etihad Stadium or Old Trafford. Football has changed over the last decade, with a different type of midfielder, emerging but Matic is a throwback, a man who will shield his defence in the same way Patrick Vieira and Roy Keane did. And, just like those two warriors, he knows how to play. ‘Matic is a player who gives balance to a team,’ Rui Costa, Benfica’s sporting director, told Sportsmail earlier this year. ‘He is someone with a great positioning and he is intelligent in the way he moves and passes the ball. He is an outstanding player.’ Matic (left) battles Emre Can (centre) and Steven Gerrard (right) for possession as Chelsea beat Liverpool . Liverpool's Jordan Henderson (left) tries to keep the ball as Matic (right) attempts to close him down . He is every inch a Mourinho player, the engine of this team. He covered 12.4km against Liverpool at the weekend, destroying everything that came near him; he won five tackles and used the ball sensibly when it came to his feet. Those numbers match what he did at the Etihad, when 100 per cent of his challenges were successful; that day his passing accuracy was 88.46 per cent and he ran 11.5km. The example he is setting is drive Chelsea forward. ‘I was a champion in different countries with different clubs and there are points that are always present,’ said Mourinho. ‘I had it here in my first spell and I’m having it now. You have to have people who are ready to sacrifice themselves, people that push to help. I’m so pleased about that.’ Such is the esteem in which Mourinho holds Matic, he chose him to deliver the team talk at Anfield. It is a tactic the Chelsea manage uses every week but, given the venue, it was significant that the Serb was handed the responsibility. ‘Everyone has their place in the team and knows what it is,’ Cesar Azpilicueta explained. ‘The whole squad know we have to fight together. Some players have more talent, some score goals, and sometimes we have to defend for them. But the main thing is we do it all as a team.

Cesar Azpilicueta (left) celebrates Chelsea's 2-1 win at Anfield alongside captain John Terry (right) at full time .

If that is the target – to be champions – then you have to come to these sort of stadiums and get a result. He said would be really hard but we have to do a great job – and we have to win.’ The intensity of his words matched the intensity of his performance. Matic is not an artist but, of the all signings Mourinho has made since returning to Stamford Bridge, his decision to bring back the 26-year-old from Benfica for a second spell might just be the smartest. Should Matic continue in such devastating form, he will give his fellow professionals something to think about. As Mourinho says, it is credit he deserves.","Jose Mourinho lauds midfielder Nemanja Matic's display at Anfield .

"As one of the most beguiling characters in English literature, Elizabeth Bennet has been described as high-spirited and honest to a fault. Little wonder, then, that the Duchess of Cornwall has admitted she rather admires the Pride And Prejudice heroine. Asked yesterday which storybook character she would like to be, Camilla initially gave the odd response of Winnie The Pooh. Britain's Camilla, The Duchess of Cornwall, unveils a plaque at the offices of First News in London . Camilla meets young reporter Chloe Miller, 11, as she toured the First News offices yesterday . Her reason soon became clear, however, as she explained: ‘I would love to have my fingers stuck in honey’. She then revealed that her all-time heroine is Jane Austen’s feisty Lizzy, who defies social conventions – and her own prejudice – to fall in love with the proud Mr Fitzwilliam Darcy. The only question is whether Prince Charles would be her Darcy?

"Complications: Lauren Yardley had surgery to go from an A to a DD cup . Lauren Yardley had always dreamed of having a more curvaceous figure. So at 25, and tired of her ‘boyish’ shape, she decided to buy what Mother Nature had not given her. She paid almost £4,000 for a breast implant operation, increasing her A-cup size breasts to DD. But to her horror, just two months after the surgery, her body started to reject one of the implants. Weeks later, it actually started protruding from her chest and came through the skin. Now the nursery worker wants to warn women of the potential pitfalls of cosmetic surgery. ‘I couldn’t believe it when the implant started coming out of my breast,’ she recalled. ‘At first it was like a blister, but then over the next week it started to come out more and more. ‘I did not feel too much pain, just discomfort. The doctors at the . hospital said they had never seen anything like it – they couldn’t . believe I was not in septic shock. I feel very lucky, it could have . been a lot worse.’ Miss Yardley, from Coventry, paid £3,750 at a private clinic for breast . implants in September 2009. Soon after the surgery,  her right breast . became hard  and lumpy. Doctors diagnosed capsular contracture, a common complication in implant . surgery, in which the body forms a capsule of scar tissue around the . implant. Unhappy: Lauren decided to have surgery because she was  she hated her flat chest and was 'fed-up of looking like a boy' But her body rejected one of the implants and began removing it through the weakened tissue of the scar . It is a natural process and usually settles. In Miss Yardley’s . case, however, the scar tissue tightened around the implant so much that . it started squeezing it out of her body. She paid another £850 for surgeons to replace the implant. But two months later she was rushed to A&E at Coventry University . Hospital when the implant started protruding from her breast. Uneven: After the right implant worked its way out, Lauren (centre) was forced to insert extra padding into her bra to even up her lopsided breast . Unlucky: Lauren, who had surgery the same day as her sister Natalie (right) wants to warn other women of the potential dangers of having implants . Lauren paid £3,750 at a private clinic for breast implants in September 2009 . After . checks, she was transferred  back to the Tonic Cosmetic Surgery clinic . in Nottingham where surgeons safely removed the rejected implant. Then came the worst part of her ordeal. She had to wait seven months for . her body to heal, with one breast totally flat and the other still DD . before doctors could replace the implant again. She also had to pay . another £1,000. ‘The most horrific thing was having only one breast for seven months,’ she said. ‘I was booked to go on holiday to Tenerife for two weeks so I . had to pad out my bra so people would not notice. When I booked the . operation they told me it was common for the body to reject implants – . but I had no idea this could happen. ‘People always ask me if I would have implants again after all I have . been through but I always say yes. I don’t regret it at all. But it has . cost me a fortune to have all the follow-up operations.’ A spokesman for Tonic Cosmetic Surgery said: ‘Most women who have breast . implants will experience some level of capsular contracture. Lauren’s . is probably one of the worst cases we have seen.’ Capsular contracture, an unavoidable . complication of breast implant surgery, affects most patients to some . degree. If it occurs, it is likely further surgery will be needed. The body creates a capsule of fibrous scar issue about the breast implant as part of the healing process. This is a natural reaction that occurs when any foreign object is surgically implanted into the body. The scar tissue over time will begin to shrink at a rate and extent which varies from person to person. In . some cases, such as Lauren's, the capsule can tighten and squeeze the . implant, making the breast feel hard or even eject itself from the body.","Lauren Yardley, 25, had the surgery to go from a size A cup to a DD .

"Betting companies have been accused of encouraging young people and women to gamble by taking bets on the outcome of reality television shows. Major bookmakers such as Coral, Ladbrokes, William Hill and Paddy Power allow punters to place bets on shows such as The X Factor and Strictly Come Dancing. And, with the rise of online betting, people no longer need to travel to dedicated shops to place bets, being able to gamble on their phone or computer from the comfort of their own home. Bookmakers such as Coral (pictured) are offering odds on X Factor and Strictly Come Dancing results . Politicians and academics said yesterday that companies should act more responsibly to ensure that young people don’t become addicted to gambling. They also called for adverts promoting gambling to be taken off air before the watershed or even for betting to be banned on shows broadcast before the 9pm cut-off point. Liberal Democrat MP Tessa Munt said bookmakers should not be encouraging young people to gamble by accepting bets on these shows. She said: ‘I’m a liberal, so I tend to think people should take responsibility for themselves but the problem is that the audience for these [reality television] shows – and you only have to look at the crowd that attends these events – is young people. ‘It’s not safe to guide people up this path and teach them it’s okay to bet on everything. Gambling is something that adults should be allowed to choose to do but it is not something that should be touted and advertised at younger people. ‘It is a new market because I’m sure there will be very little overlap between those who watch reality television and those who sit in front of the horse racing. 'We need to ask the companies to act more responsibly and to take the right steps to protect people. Critics accused the businesses of trying to lure in younger customers by offering odds on the shows . ‘People need to know that you don’t get something for nothing and the betting shop always wins’. Viewers can get odds of 13/8 for Jake Wood to win on Strictly and of 6/4 for Andrea Faustini to win X Factor, they can even place bets on whether any of the judges on the ITV talent show will swap seats on this weekend’s programmes. The audience for these shows is predominantly young and female. For Strictly Come Dancing, 63 percent of the audience is female and 52 percent under 16. Similarly with The X Factor, the figures are 62 percent and 53 percent. According to official figures collected by the Gambling Commission, more young people are starting to gamble. The number of 18-24 year olds admitting to having placed a bet in the last four weeks has risen from 38.8 percent in 2010 to 50 percent so far this year. Dr Carolyn Downs, a lecturer and Lancaster University Management School an expert on the gambling sector, said these groups are being specifically targeted by bookmakers. She said: ‘There has definitely been a move towards targeting women and young people. [Betting companies] need to get more people to gamble because otherwise, how can they grow the market?’ Viewers can bet on Jake Wood winning Strictly Come Dancing (left) and on Andrea Faustini from The X Factor . And she added that not enough is being done to stop people from gambling under the age of 18. ‘We do actually know that young people are more vulnerable to gambling. Young people are not allowed to go and bet in a betting shop but it’s much more difficult to regulate that in an online environment. 'They can use a parent’s credit or debit card, we know that happens, and it’s difficult to police, especially as they have access to the internet 24/7’. Professor Mark Griffiths, of Nottingham Trent University, agreed that it is a conscious shift in direction being taken by the gambling industry. He said: ‘Traditionally betting, particularly in bookmakers, has been a male domain. 'Now, that’s not say that females aren’t interested in sport but in all honesty they don’t tend to bet on it but they are interested on who’s going to leave the Big Brother house, who’s going to win X Factor, those kind of things. 'I personally think it’s bookmakers wanting to increase their clientele and getting more people betting. ‘Then of course, we’ve also got a young youth culture coming through and I would not be surprised if you have young men as well at 18 and 19 betting on X Factor or Big Brother like they would on sporting events.’ Critics fear the availability of online gambling is dangerous for young consumers . There have also been calls for betting companies to show greater responsibility in who they encourage to gamble, with some suggesting that having adverts for betting companies airing before the watershed send the wrong message to young people. Professor Griffiths said: ‘I don’t have an anti-gambling bone in my body but I personally don’t want to see gambling adverts before the watershed at nine o’clock, that might sound a bit draconian but my kids are lucky that they have a father who can explain the ins and outs of gambling and why, in the long run, people don’t win.’ Miss Munt went even further, calling for bookmakers to stop accepting bets on television programmes aired before the watershed. She said: ‘The watershed is the watershed and this shouldn’t be happening before that time. This is an adult activity and you have to take responsibility for losing your own money. 'If these programmes are on before the watershed then they shouldn’t be involved in any sort of gaming.’ A spokesman for the Association of British Bookmakers said: ‘In independent age verification testing, the latest figures show an 87 per cent success rate on challenging young people for ID who attempted to place a bet. ‘Since 2009, all the major operators have funded independent age verification testing in all of their shops. A high compliance rate was found from the very start, with the industry now regularly scoring far higher than other age restricted retail sectors. ‘Last month, for example, William Hill received the highest score for any age related retailer for successfully keeping underage teens from their shops. ‘And all operators enforce a rigid ‘Think 21’ policy as part of the ABB Code for Responsible Gambling.’","Bookmakers offering bets on who might win Strictly Come Dancing .

"There have been lion and tiger cubs, baby gorillas, rhinos and giraffes, but for the first time in 40 years Longleat stately home and safari park in Wiltshire is expecting the arrival of a baby human. Society beauty Emma McQuiston, AKA the Viscountess of Weymouth, is three months pregnant with her first baby on her first wedding anniversary. This will also be the first child for her husband Ceawlin Thynn, 40, the Viscount of Weymouth, son of the 7th Marquess of Bath and heir to the Longleat estate. Emma McQuiston, the Viscountess Weymouth at her 900-acre Longleat estate . Emma revealed the exciting news in an exclusive interview in Hello! Magazine: . 'I never thought I'd say I want a big tummy!' the aspiring TV presenter joked. 'But when the bump shows, it's like, ""This is real"".' The 28-year-old, who is half Nigerian, believes the baby will bring the aristocratic family closer together in the aftermath if a rift amongst the family. Ceawlin's father, the Marquess of Bath,  known for his Bohemian lifestyle and prolific sex life, snubbed the couple and refused to attend their wedding. Emma looking exquisite on her wedding day at Longleat last June . Emma McQuiston in February, the month before she fell pregnant (left), and in December at 'Mandela: long walk to freedom' film premiere (right) Reportedly, the father and son fell out over the removal of murals from . the walls of the historic estate in Wiltshire. At the time Lady Emma said of . Lord Bath’s absence, ‘It’s very sad he didn’t come to the wedding and . that the misunderstanding has escalated to this point, but what can I . do?’ Now that the couple and the eccentric Lord have made amends, a baby will no doubt add to the family unity. The Viscountess, who likes to be known as plain Emma told Hello! that the couple had been trying for a baby since January and were overjoyed when a home pregnancy test revealed Emma was expecting back in March. The Viscountess Weymouth likes to be known as plain Emma . When Emma, 28, went for her first scan, the baby was under a centimetre long and 'looked like a frog!'. But the couple decided to keep their exciting news a secret until after their major scan at 12  weeks. By the next scan, Emma could see a huge pair of lips, which she says were just like her own as a child, and a tiny fist which was clenching and unclenching on the screen. The couple don't yet know the baby's sex, although Emma said she would be happy with either, but the little heir will be welcomed into the world in a room fit for a King. Emma is planning to give birth at the Lindo Wing of St Mary's hospital, where Prince George was born last year. Princes William and Harry were also born there, as was Emma herself. Society beauty: Emma models lavish ballgowns in the nooks and crannies of the Longleat estate . Down-to-earth Emma admitted in her interview that watching One Born Every Minute has given her a taste of what's to come -- and that she has every intention of using painkillers. A new baby will be another exciting reason to visit Longleat, which has seen some additions since Emma's arrival including a children's ride and an exhibition of her wedding dress. Going up in the world: Emma on the stairs of the country pile . Emma's dress was put on display in May, along with a new portrait of the blushing bride painted by renowned artist Paul Benney. The showcase includes portraits of her big day as well as diaries, photos, portraits and even newsreel footage of previous Thynn family weddings. She's said of the exhibit, ‘It's a lovely reminder of the wedding and it is a great way to showcase all the amazing work and effort others put in to make it such a memorable and joyous occasion. ‘It’s also fascinating to be able to compare it to other weddings which have taken place here at Longleat over the centuries.’ And now with the next generation on its way, there may be plenty more weddings at Longleat to look forward to. Where's the highchair? Soon there'll be a little heir at the dining table .","Emma McQuiston , 28, revealed she is three months pregnant .

"Spain will assess Cesc Fabregas' fitness on Monday to see whether he will be able to link up with the squad, with reports suggesting the Chelsea midfielder could be out for three weeks. Fabregas played the whole of Chelsea's 2-1 Premier League win over Liverpool on Saturday but Blues boss Jose Mourinho admitted afterwards he had taken a 'gamble' with the 27-year-old's hamstring problem. Mourinho also said that Fabregas could link up with Spain ahead of their upcoming matches against Belarus and Germany, but added that he 'would be back' as he was not fit. Cesc Fabregas (left) played against Chelsea despite not being 100 per cent fit . Fabregas is to be assessed by Spain doctors on Monday to determine his availability for the national side . Fabregas is now set to undergo tests with his national team on Monday to determine his availability. Spain team doctor Oscar Celada told Radio Marca: 'We will assess him in the coming hours to see if he can form part of the squad. 'We know Cesc, I've known him since he was 16 years old, I know his professionalism and commitment to the national team, but we are still waiting to assess him.' Jose Mourinho said the midfielder could go away with Spain but he 'would be back' because he is injured . Fabregas (left) has been in brilliant form for Chelsea since joining the club this summer from Barcelona . Spain coach Vicente del Bosque added on the national team's official website: 'The most prudent thing is that he sees the Spanish national team medical staff. It's not a lack of confidence in the medical staff at his club, but after playing 95 minutes this weekend we would like to see him and examine him.' Fabregas has shone since joining Chelsea from Barcelona this summer, and has forged an impressive partnership with another new boy in Diego Costa. Costa is also an international colleague of Fabregas', although the Brazil-born striker is not part of the current Spain squad after Del Bosque decided to rest him. Diego Costa returned from international duty in October with a hamstring injury . Costa, who scored the winning goal against Liverpool before being replaced late on by Didier Drogba, has been hampered by a hamstring problem that he had at previous club Atletico Madrid. Celada said of Costa: 'We have regular contact with the medical services of all the teams. We were aware that he has some discomfort, something that allows him to train sometimes but not others. 'We spoke with the player and with Chelsea and we took a decision which was for the best, to rest for these two weeks. Then his team decided that he was able to play (against Liverpool) and there's no problem. Spain manager Vicente del Bosque says he agreed with Chelsea doctors that Costa should rest . 'We did it because medically it is good for the player and if that results in the good of his club then we are happy.' Del Bosque echoed those comments, saying: 'We thought that calling him up for the two games would be counter-productive for his health and thinking of the player we preferred that he took a break. There's nothing more.'

"From presenting MTV to walking the catwalks of high end designers, such as Vivienne Westwood and Chanel, it's fair to say that Lilah Parsons is a bit of a chameleon when it comes to her career. In her latest modelling venture, the 25-year-old has ditched the designers and taken to the high street as she models the latest festival collection for online fashion retailer, Very. Following in the footsteps of Fearne Cotton and Holly Willoughby the TV presenter shows off her boho style in Very's latest festival collection featuring summer staples such as playsuits, denim & lace shorts, printed parkas, denim . jackets and maxi dresses to name a few. Swinging sixties: Lilah Parsons models Very's latest festival collection. Lilah wears Love Label printed maxi dress £29 . In a wash of sepia tones, the photo shoot captures the festival vibe perfectly with Lilah's heavy 1960s fringe adding to the 'summer of love' feel. Since being named as one of British Vogue's 'Model Faces to Watch in 2010' Lilah's career has gone from strength to strength from featuring as the face of Swatch watches across bilboards in Times Square New York to modelling for a plethora of different brands including Vivienne Westwood, Chanel, Pam Hogg and Diesel. The sepia tones of the shoot help add to the 'summer of love' feel. Here Lilah wears Love label fringe kimono £35, Foil bikini £25 and necklace £18 . Boho babe: The collection includes a variety of festival staples including maxi dresses, playsuits and summer scarves. Left, Lilah wears a maxi crochet dress £29, and printed scarf £10.

Lilah wears Love Label cut out playsuit £29 . However, Lilah's modelling career hasn't remained exclusively in the designer department as she has previously dabbled in high street modelling having appeared in campaigns for Claire's Accessories and TK Maxx. At the Claire's Paris Fashion Week party the model said she loved the brand and the fact that it was cheaper meant that she could constantly update her look. 'I love their stuff. It's fun and fashionable and it means that I can change my look every five minutes.' It appears that her shoot with Very may have had an influence on Lilah's summer style as she said that she would be channeling the sixties vibe this summer. 'This summer I'm going to be wearing lots of the round Sixties shades and piles of rings.'

"As a Formula 1 driver, Jenson Button travels the world - but when it comes to putting his feet up; he reveals Hawaii is his favourite destination. Button, who won the World Drivers Championship in 2009,  says the paradise isle is the perfect place to relax with fantastic food and sunshine-guaranteed weather after competing in a massive 19 races a year. When he's not jet-setting across the globe, the 34-year-old Somerset-born McLaren racer lives in Monaco with his fiancee Jessica Michibata. Here, the racing driver, who has teamed up with Hilton Hotels, talks to MailOnline about his most memorable holiday and recalls his most embarrassing travel scenario. Keen traveller: When he's not trotting the globe Jenson Button likes to kick back in Hawaii . What are your travel plans for 2014? I have 19 races in 2014, many of them in countries I may never go to if it was not for Formula 1 and this takes up most of my year! I do have a couple of personal holidays planned but no destinations confirmed as of yet. What’s been your most memorable holiday? I like spending time in Hawaii and go there often between Formula 1 seasons. I also like training holidays and spending time up in the mountains. For a two-week holiday, where's your favourite destination and why? I really like being in Hawaii, because it allows me to train, whilst also enjoying the weather, the great beaches and fantastic food. The perfect place to relax: Jenson says he goes to Hawaii regularly between Formula 1 seasons . Holiday companion: Jenson and his beautiful Argentinian-Japanese fianceé Jessica Michibata . What’s the best hotel you’ve stayed in and why? My favourite Grand Prix hotel is the Conrad Centennial in Singapore. We spend so much time in hotels throughout the year, but this one really stands out and the team there go above and beyond to make sure we feel at home. Singapore is a unique place for us as we stay on European time to cope with the long hours we work due to it being a night race, so for the team, the hotel also switches to European time, meaning they serve us breakfast at 2pm, then dinner when we get back from work at 6am! They keep the gym open 24hrs for us, have switched the maid service to the evening so as not to disturb us when we sleep during the day and have actually installed blackout blinds on the floors that we stay on so that we can sleep during the day. Deep in focus: Jenson Button pictured ahead of this year's Bahrain Grand Prix . Exceptional service: Jenson Button says the Conrad Centennial in Singapore is his favourite hotel . What’s been your most extravagant travel-related purchase? Probably when I fly privately, although I don’t do that very often. It’s mostly for races and allows me to get there and back a lot easier . Which country would you happily go back to time and again – and why? America because it has everything. I love California, but also big cities like New York, Hawaii...it’s all very different. London rules: Jenson Button says the British capital is the best place in the world for a city break . What’s your favourite restaurant in the UK and why? My favourite restaurant is a Japanese restaurant in London called Umu which does fantastic Japanese food. I also really like Maggie Jones which does great traditional English food. Where's the best place in the world for a city break and why? I really love London. It’s probably the city I know the most although I don’t get to spend much time there anymore, as I live in Monaco and when I am in the UK it is mostly for training at the McLaren Technology Centre. If I was going to travel to a city, it would definitely be Tokyo. I love the food and the culture and it’s a very chilled city, very diverse, but they still have their traditions which is great. French home: Jenson resides in Monaco when he is not jetting across the globe . Tell us an embarrassing travel scenario you’ve found yourself in… . I was once in the lounge at Heathrow waiting to fly, and someone mistook me for Chris Martin from Coldplay. An American family came up and told me they’d been big fans for years, so I signed a few autographs for them before they then told me they had all my albums! When I told them who I really was, they said they were still big fans...although I actually don’t think they knew who I was! Lookalikes: Jenson Button, left, and Coldplay star Chris Martin . If you could pick anyone (not family or friends) famous to travel with, who would it be and why? If I had to pick someone it would be Audrey Hepburn, because my fianceé is a big fan and I know she would like it! Although I’m really not that sort of person and would not want to go on holiday with someone just because they were famous. I would much rather spend time with friends and family who I know I would have a great time with. Ideal celebrity travel companion: Jenson says he would choose Audrey Hepurn as Jessica is a fan . Who’s the most interesting person you’ve met on your travels and why? My friends and family are the most interesting people I travel with, because I love spending time with them and they are the people who know me best so we always have a great time together, whether travelling for work or pleasure. What’s your top travel tip? If you can manage it, just travel with hand luggage. It makes it so much easier when you get to your destination and don’t have to wait for your luggage!

"The aerial pictures of the devastation that wrecked Queens and struck at the heart of the close-knit community of Breezy Point.

"Some of Australia’s best stories are not always as they seem, in fact sometimes they're simply a myth. From remote outback cattle stations to bustling cities and coastal havens, Sydney author Jim Haynes has interviewed some of the most interesting people to bring back some truth to what we think we know. ‘Australia’s best unknown stories’ brings an impressive collection of hilarious and quirky yarns and furphies that share and capture the heart and soul of the Australian spirit. Jim believes there are always going to be more things you don’t know than things you do know. It goes without saying. Scroll down for video . The Holden (SSV commodore pictured) was not the first car specifically designed for Australia conditions. It hailed from America, based on a US designed, but previously rejected, post-war Chevrolet . The ashes vase (pictured) does not contain anything to do with cricket but the ashes of a lady's hat veil . The patriot chant Aussie Aussie Aussie Oy Oy Oy actually hails from the Welsh, from a pastie . 'As Hamlet (or was it Bill Shakespeare?) reminded us a few centuries ago, there are more things in heaven and earth than we can dream of.' Sydney author Jim Haynes says there are plenty of stories we have believed for years that are in fact a myth . 'What is sometimes very strange, however, is what we do know and what we don’t. Even more fascinating, to me at least, is what we think we know, but what may not be true at all.' Jim, who has been a radio announcer for 2UE for 13 years admits he has a great passion for Australia and loves the quirky but interesting stories. ‘Hardly ground breaking world events but they just interest me because we tend to believe what we’re told and the truth is something else altogether.’ ‘I tried to think about what would interest readers, we’re always fascinated by stories,’ he said. ‘If you want people to get interested in something you tell them a story.’ He says in life there are always nice stories but sometimes they’re simply not true. ‘We get told this stuff but it’s really nothing of the kind.’ ‘Sometimes its publicity stunts, sometimes we just want to believe something.’ ‘But these days with social media, people are far more aware, a little more sceptical.’ ‘People like to believe the dramatic, I find knowing the truth is even more interesting, quite amazing to know.’ ‘The quirky real stuff is far more interesting than the dramatic spin.’ So to start with one of the most obvious myths….. The Holden (pictured) has long been a national legend ‘the first car specifically designed for Australian conditions’. Well, it's not a legend, it’s a myth according to history . Australia’s car . It has long been a national legend that the Holden was ‘the first car specifically designed for Australian conditions’. Well, that’s not a legend, it’s a myth. During World War II the government, along with both Ford and General Motors-Holden, explored the possibility of a locally produced affordable motorcar. The Holden Company began life in 1856 as saddle and harness makers. In 1908 the company moved into the automotive field before becoming a subsidiary of US Company General Motors (GM) in 1931. After the war General Motors-Holden continued to pursue the idea. Managing director Laurence Hartnett wanted a local design, while the company preferred to see an American one. The final design for ‘Australia’s Own Car’ was based on a US designed, but previously rejected, post-war Chevrolet. The name ‘Holden’ was chosen, incidentally, in honour of Sir Edward Holden, the company’s first chairman. Other names considered were ‘GeM’, ‘Austral’, ‘Melba’, ‘Woomerah’, ‘Boomerang’, ‘Emu’ and ‘Canbra’. Contrary to what Aussies believe, and what we have been told for more than a century, the tiny Ashes vase (pictured), which is actually a ladies’ scent bottle, does not contain the ashes of stumps, bails, balls or anything vaguely connected with the game of cricket . The Ashes . Contrary to what Aussies believe, and what we have been told for more than a century, that tiny vase, which is actually a ladies’ scent bottle, does not contain the ashes of stumps, bails, balls or anything vaguely connected with the game of cricket. It contains the ashes of a lady’s hat veil. When England lost at home for the first time to Australia, in 1882, a mock obituary was inserted in the Sporting Times, which read: . In Affectionate Remembrance of ENGLISH CRICKET, which died at the Oval on 29th AUGUST, 1882, Deeply lamented by a large circle of sorrowing friends and acquaintances R.I.P. N.B.—The body will be cremated and the ashes taken to Australia. This was the beginning of the Ashes legend. When the Eighth Earl of Darnley, Ivo Bligh, led the English team to Australia in the following English winter, the English press joked that he was going to ‘bring back the ashes’. When his team won two of the three official tests, a group of Melbourne ladies, including Bligh’s future wife, Florence Morphy of Beechworth in Victoria, and Lady Clarke, who had, along with her husband, entertained the English team in Melbourne, made a joke presentation to him of a terracotta scent bottle, which contained some ashes. The Countess of Darnley presented the urn to the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) after her husband’s death. She died in August 1944. Replicas of the urn are used as trophies for the Ashes Series but the original remains with the MCC in London. In 1998 Darnley’s 82-year-old daughter-in-law said the ashes were the remains of her mother-in-law’s hat veil. MCC officials, however, still persist with the nonsense that they are ‘95 per cent certain’ that the urn contains the ashes of a cricket bail, most likely one used in a social game between the English team and a team chosen by Sir W.J. Clarke. While ‘bail’ and ‘veil’ are very close in sound and a misunderstanding is plausible, anyone understanding the nature of the joke presentation (and how hard it is to actually cremate a cricket bail and recover the ashes) will realise that ‘the ashes’ in all likelihood, derived from something much easier to incinerate than a wooden bail and leather ball. At least that’s my opinion . The chant Aussie Aussie Aussie Oy Oy Oy comes from the Walsh pastie, an oggie. Oggie sellers would push carts along the docks and call oggie oggie oggie and the miners would reply oy oy oy if they wanted to purchase one . Aussie Aussie Aussie! Oy! Oy! Oy! While this is a perfectly fine patriotic chant, and I am not suggesting for a second that we stop using it to inspire our athletes, it's about as Australian as a Walsh pastie - literally. Like the cornishmen who are famous for their pasties, the Welsh have a long history of working underground industry and also have their own local version of the miners daily lunchtime pastie - the 'oggie'. The original idea of the pastie was that it contained an entire meal, meat and vegetables, or often meat and vegetables at one end and jam or fruit and custard at the other, all wrapped in a baked pastry cover. The miners' wives would make the pasties with a ridge of crust along one side so that the miners could hold them in their filthy hands while eating their lunch underground. The crust was the discarded for the rats which lived in the mines. This kept the creatures attacking the men while they were eating. Oggie sellers would push carts along the docks and working areas of Cardiff and other Welsh cities and call 'oggie, oggie, oggie' to advertise their wares. The reply 'oy, oy, oy' was a response to anyone wishing to purchase. It was a signal for the oggie salesman to stop and wait until the customer could catch up and make a purchase. Sydney author Jim Haynes says ‘people like to believe the dramatic, I find knowing the truth is even more interesting, quite amazing to know' Famous entertainer Max Boyce based his entire act on ‘being Welsh’ with Welsh songs, jokes and anecdotes about rugby and mining. Boyce was hugely popular in the 1960s and 1970s and adopted the call of the oggie salesmen as a gimmick to use with his audiences. Australian entertainer Frank Ifield was touring the theatre circuit in Britain with Max Boyce in the 1970s and saw how Boyce had made the call a rallying cry for audiences. It was also used at rugby matches and in other contexts as a light-hearted method of asserting anyone’s ‘Welshness’. When I lived in a Welsh-speaking college at Aberystwyth University, it was often used between songs when spontaneous singing occurred in the dining hall (often rather ‘anti-English’ satirical songs or Celtic rebel songs). While following Max Boyce around the theatre circuit, Frank decided to tease audiences with a version of the chant which asserted his Australian nationality. ‘I did it as a joke, just for fun,’ says Frank. ‘Knowing that Max had used his 'Oggie, oggie, oggie!' chant to warm up the audience, I’d parody the chant by yelling 'Aussie, Aussie, Aussie!' to get the same response. It was just light-hearted fun.’ So, there you have it. Our fine patriotic chant is, genuinely, about as Australian as a Welsh miner’s lunch. Not only are there many things we don’t know, we should never be too sure about the things we are sure we do know!

"After university I started an internship at Tatler, where I was surrounded by beautiful women, and was lucky enough to be promoted to picture editor even though I had no experience in photography. But I was frustrated because after a few gap years travelling, I wanted more adventure. One morning in 2000, I opened a newspaper and there was a story about the BBC making the most daring TV show ever... and I knew I had to be part of it. They wanted volunteers to be marooned on an island called Taransay in the Outer Hebrides for a year and I jumped at the chance to be a real-life Robinson Crusoe. Ben Fogle jumped at the chance to take part in a reality show called Castaway in which he was marooned on an island in the Outer Hebrides for a year . The series was called Castaway and it was one of the very first reality shows. There were 36 castaways in all, including families with young children and singles like me, and we were allowed to take one luxury, so I chose a black Labrador puppy called Inca. Everyone else seemed to have a life skill that would help us to be self-sufficient on an island for a whole year. We had a farmer, a butcher, a doctor, a teacher, and I had a second-rate degree in Latin American studies and could speak a bit of Spanish! But I've always been a bit of a peacemaker, and I like to think I tried to bond the group together. I was also a hard grafter and willing to get my hands dirty. When we first arrived we had to cut tons of turf to put on the pods that we lived in, and roll out water pipes, plant crops, and milk cows. We also had to slaughter pigs and sheep, and on my first attempt at wringing a chicken's neck I couldn't do it and ended up in tears. Before I went to the island I was very shy and insecure in myself. Being there gave me this confidence that I'd achieved something that not everyone else in the world had done. Ben says that his trip to Taransay was a steep learning curve into the realities of life and the importance of green issues . That year on Taransay opened my eyes to so much more than just an opportunity to be part of the world of television. It was a steep learning curve into the realities of life and the importance of green issues. Taransay meant so much to me that I took my wife Marina there for our honeymoon and my dream is still to move to an island like that with my family one day. When it came up for sale two years ago I raised £2½ million to buy it, but unfortunately it had been sold. When I left, I made the most of the following year, going to East Timor to report on the civil war for Hello! magazine and signing my first book deal, which took me to Britain's most remote overseas territories including Saint Helena and Ascension Island. And since then I've had many life-changing adventures filmed for TV, including racing across the Antarctic, swimming from Alcatraz to San Francisco and rowing the Atlantic with Olympic Gold Medallist James Cracknell, during which I nearly met my maker. If I hadn't gone to Taransay, I don't believe I'd have gone into television, or be married to my wife – I met Marina while walking Inca in the park. And none of it would have happened if I hadn't opened the newspaper that day. Ben Fogle has launched Ben Fogle's Great Adventures, a series of shore excursions with Celebrity Cruises.

"More than 200 seriously ill patients, including 20 babies, were forced to evacuate one of New York City’s major hospitals late Monday after the power went out. The frantic exodus followed the failure of a backup generator, with dozens of ambulances lining up around the block outside New York University Tisch Hospital.

Concerns: Medics help a patient into an ambulance during an evacuation of NYU Tisch Hospital, after its backup generator failed . A doctor has today spoken about the nightmare scenario and how he and his colleagues evacuated patients - many of whom were too sick to walk down staircases - out of the hospital. Dr Jonathan LaPook told CBS news: 'They were painstakingly carried on plastic sleds, one by one, by teams of four to five people from as high up as the 17th floor.' He added that another Dr, Mark Pochapin, co-ordinated communication between staff and ensure that everyone was accounted for. Dr LaPook added: The intensive care unit was already evacuated when I arrived. Lit only by my flashlight, filled with crumpled blankets and other evidence of a hasty retreat, it appeared eerie to me - like a scene in a movie where a cup of still warm coffee tells the detective that somebody had been in a room only minutes before. 'But this was undeniably real life and the clock was ticking as the team of workers raced to evacuate the patients.' 'It's a challenging situation,' NYU . Medical Dean Robert Grossman told WCBS-TV.

Without power, there are no elevators, . meaning patients - some of whom are being treated for . serious illnesses such as cancer - had to be carefully carried down staircases, . said Grossman. As the patients were evacuated, gusts . of wind blew their blankets. Nurses and staff huddled around the . patients, some holding IVs and other equipment. Ambulances came from around the city . to help transport the sick. Patients will be taken to other hospitals . including Mount Sinai and the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer.

"A singer who created a custom song for a newlywed couple has revealed the lyrics about falling and climbing up hills that seem spooky now that the wife admitted to killing her husband by pushing him off a cliff. Jordan Linn Graham has been released from police custody after allegedly telling police that she and her husband Cody were fighting during a hike and she ended up shoving him to his death. Jordan, 22, has been put under house arrest and is wearing a GPS monitoring bracelet while she stays at her parents' Kalispell, Montana home until her trial. Happier times: Jordan and Cody Johnson got married eight days before she allegedly pushed him to his death . Downward spiral: Her defense attorneys are now arguing that Graham, seen here dancing with her husband at their wedding just eight days before his death, was having post-wedding 'blues' The latest revelations about the seemingly prophetic song now adds another layer of intrigue to the case, as the woman who wrote the song said that she came up with the lyrics based on a series of interviews with the couple before their wedding. 'I used words like ""you helped me to climb higher for a better view, you're my safe place to fall, you never let me go,""' songwriter Elizabeth Shea told CNN. 'Now when I hear those words, it's a little creepy.' Judge Donald Molloy determined Friday that 22-year-old Jordan Linn Graham does not pose a flight risk. Molloy said during a brief hearing that restrictions placed on Graham's release address concerns that she poses a risk to the community or herself.

According to charging documents Graham had been having second thoughts about getting married around the time the body of her husband was discovered. Her release comes a day after Montana prosecutors revealed that an email was allegedly sent from a man named 'Tony' while Graham's husband was still missing. Songwriter: Elizabeth Shea came up with the lyrics based on interviews she had with the couple before the wedding . The email, sent three days after Cody Lee Johnson went missing, claimed he had fallen and died after going hiking with three friends. According to the affidavit, the message also suggested 'the search should be called off', according to the Missoulian. Graham (left) 'pushed Johnson (right) with both hands in the back, and as a result, he fell face first off the cliff,' an affidavit states .

"A middle school teacher has been arrested after allegedly seducing a 15-year-old student over Twitter and taking her virginity in his office at a school outside Philadelphia. William A. Barber, 38, had sex with the student while his wife was pregnant with the couple's fourth child, detectives say. Barber has been a Garnet Valley Middle School teacher for the last 12 years. In the past few weeks, the well-liked physical education teacher and his wife have been in the spotlight for creating the viral 'lemon shot challenge' to raise funds to help their four-year-old daughter who suffers from pediatric cancer. Barber promoted the challenge on local TV stations and through his Twitter account -- but police say that's not all Barber used his Twitter account for. Scroll down for video . Arrested: William Barber, 38, was arrested Tuesday afternoon for allegedly having sex with a 15-year-old female student . Barber and his family, seen here with local FOX TV hosts (left and right), promoted the 'lemon shot challenge' on TV and social media to promote awareness of pediatric cancer . Sexting: Authorities say that Barber and the teen communicated through text message and Twitter . Authorities say that the 15-year-old, who had been in Barber's physical education class when she was in eighth grade, communicated with Barber through text message and social media and that Barber 'lured' her via Twitter. Some Twitter messages to the teen read: 'Wow you are a very sexy young lady,' 'You could have been here but it’s all good. I shouldn't temp (sic) myself anyway,' and 'But your body makes me crazy. Ugh...' Garnet Valley students alerted staff of an 'inappropriate relationship' between Barber and a student on Monday, according to a letter  to parents from Garnet Valley School District Superintendent Marc Bertrando. Barber allegedly sexually assaulted the female student  on September 12 in his middle school office. The Delaware County Daily Times reports that the two met in Barber's office at approximately 3.30pm and began kissing. They then moved to a back room of the office where they had sexual intercourse. The Times also reports that, in an affidavit, the teen said the intercourse did not last a long period of time due to the pain of it being her 'first time.' The teen stated in the affidavit that she sent Barber nude photographs of herself, according to the Times. Trooper Mark Gibble spoke to Barber and the Times reports that Barber admitted to being with the teen in his office and being fully aware that she was 15. Barber also admitted to kissing the teen and receiving nude photographs from her. An investigation launched Monday led to Barber's arrest by Pennsylvania State Police with charges including statutory sexual assault, institutional sexual assault, unlawful contact with a minor, corruption of a minor and indecent assault. Delaware County District Attorney Jack Whelan told the Times Tuesday night that Barber is facing 'substantial incarceration' and though sexual assault cases generally involve more than one victim, no current evidence suggests that is the case. At a preliminary arraignment held Tuesday, Barber's attorney Elizabeth McDonald reportedly cited Barber's lack of a criminal history, his lifelong Delaware County residency, and his being married with three children. McDonald asked Magisterial District Judge Walter Strohl to give Barber unsecured bail -- the request was denied. Barber is on paid administrative leave from the school district, according to MyFox Philly. Lemon shot challenge: Barber, his pregnant wife and their three children have been in the spotlight recently for their efforts to raise money for pediatric cancer research . Barber's  four-year-old daughter has been hospitalized recently with pediatric cancer . Barber was hired by the school district in 2002 and had become a familiar and beloved face in the neighborhood. In his letter, school superintendent Bertrando reportedly said that he understands that Barber's allegations will leave members of the close-knit community 'feeling betrayed.' 'The safety, welfare, and health of our students and staff is our utmost concern,' Bertrando stated in his letter, 'and we are acutely aware of how difficult this situation will be for our entire community.' He assured parents that the 12-year Garnet Valley teacher had passed all child abuse and criminal history clearances when he was hired. Barber is married with three children. His wife is due to have their fourth child in a few weeks . Barber's allegations have left many parents and community members in shock, however, some parents are standing behind the well-liked teacher. In an interview with MyFox Philly, parent Lisa McCusker said Barber was 'phenomenal.' 'Without him as a teacher my daughter would not have thrived. She has special needs. He's an amazing guy,' McCusker said. Not all of the parents share McCusker's view. Parent Fran Griffith  that Barber's allegations are disgusting and that she 'feels sorry for his wife.' In a MyFox interview, Bertrando said that the district will be involved in supporting its students and will 'let the legal process take its course.'","William Barber, 38, allegedly had sexual intercourse with a former student in his office .

Minor injuries: The Italian news agency ANSA quoted officials saying the ten 'code green' injuries were treated at the airport . In February an Alitalia aeroplane which veered off a runway after landing in strong winds was re-painted white to conceal the airline's insignia to avoid bad publicity. The ATR-72 turboprop plane, which belonged to Romanian carrier Carpatair but was leased by Italian carrier Alitalia, was re-painted to protect the brand's reputation, officials have said, causing anger among unions. Displaying the Alitalia colours and logo, the plane, which was traveling from Pisa-Galileo Airport to Leonardo da Vinci airport in Rome, crashed injuring six. Alitalia argued that the paint job was standard corporate practice to protect brand reputation and operated all over the world. Meanwhile in California, passengers on board a private jet that crashed into a hanger as it landed at Santa Monica Municipal Airport were not so lucky. Rescuers and investigators were working amid the smoldering wreckage but they did not expect to find any survivors from the flight from Idaho with an unknown number aboard, officials said. 'This was an unsurvivable crash,' Santa . Monica Fire Department Capt. John Nevandro said at a media briefing . hours later at Santa Monica Municipal Airport. Distress: Unharmed passengers who were on board the A A320 plane of Alitalia airline are assisted in a closed-off area at Leonardo da Vinci airport in Fiumicino, Rome . Because the hangar collapsed in flames around it and a crane would be required before the plane could be reached, investigators had been unable to determine how many people were aboard the twin-engine Cessna Citation designed to hold eight passengers and two crew members, officials said. It had taken off from Hailey, Idaho and landed in Santa Monica when it went off the right side of the runway at about 6:20 p.m. and struck the hangar, Federal Aviation Administration spokesman Ian Gregor said. The blaze did minor damage to two other buildings and destroyed the hangar. 'It was a total loss,' Fire Department spokeswoman Bridgett Lewis said.","The Airbus 320 toppled and skidded off tarmac after gear failed in storm .

"Casey Kasem has been taken off life support and his doctors have begun focusing on making him comfortable instead of prolonging his life. The announcement, from the 82-year-old American Top 40 host's daughter Kerri Kasem, comes after a lengthy legal battle over his care between his children from his first marriage and Jean, his current wife. Kasem is said to be suffering from dementia, Parkinson's disease and sepsis. A judge ruled Wednesday that Kasem's doctors should stop force-feeding the dying broadcast legend and allow him to slip away - despite the legal and emotional objections of Jean, who declared 'You have blood on your hands!' But Kasem's life will not end without even more legal drama. TMZ.com reports that Santa Monica police are investigating Jean for criminal elder abuse. Critical condition: Radio host Kasem, center, has developed sepsis from an infected bedsore . Health concerns: Hospital staff caring for Casey Kasem claim they warned his wife of the dangers of moving him . Kerri Kasem, Casey's daughter from his first marriage, filed a police report alleging that Jean's decision to remove Casey from a Santa Monica, California, nursing home last month were criminal - and that they could ultimately contribute to his death. Kerri claims her step-mother took ailing Casey to Nevada, Arizona and then to Washington in an attempt to find a secret location to care for him and keep him away from his children. Jean ultimately housed her ill husband in secret at a friend's home in Washington State outside Seattle - until Kerri tracked the couple down and won a court order allowing him to be taken to a hospital. Kerri is claiming that in her step-mother's haste to spirit Casey away from the rest of his family and friends, he developed a bed sore that became infected. Feud: Kerri Kasem, right, how now reportedly accused her step mother Jean, left, of elder abuse for removing Casey Kasem from his nursing home . Update: In a Facebook post Kerri Kasem announced that her father had been removed from life support . TMZ reports that Kerri says she has medical documents that show the bed sore will likely contribute to Kasem's death. Kerri posted on her Facebook page that her father is now dying in a Washington state hospital. 'Transitioning our father’s treatment to comfort-oriented care was one of the hardest decisions we’ve ever had to make,' she wrote. 'For the last 11 days, our father has been surrounded day and night by love and care by his daughters Kerri and Julie, his son Mike, his brother Mouner and sister-in-law Mary, and his dear friend Gonzalo Venecia,' she added.","Daughter Kerri Kasem had implemented the end-of life measures on June 6 after being granted custody of her father .

"The landscape for dating has changed a little since the days of Shakespeare with many of us turning to match-making websites and apps such as Tinder in hope of finding true love. However, one young singleton was determined to bring a bit of old-fashioned romance back to online dating. Lifestyle website The Debrief set one of its writers, Sophie Cullinane, the hilarious task of using some of history's greatest love letters as the script for Tinder conversations with potential new dates. Love online: Many of us now use dating websites and apps such as Tinder while looking for a relationship . Some of the letters used as the basis for conversation included those to Barbara from George Bush during World War two and entries in Frida Kahlo's diary dedicated to her lover Diego Rivera. Once Sophie had her conversations (mainly ending in being blocked) she then rated her potential suitors out of ten and gave the lessons that she learnt from each man. The results range from the completely outraged to the surprisingly charming and for some guys the clincher still remains on what football team you support. George H. Bush to Barbara Bush, 1943 . George H. Bush wrote this in a touching letter to a Barbara Pierce of Rye, New York while he was away during World War II. It is one of the many love letters George wrote to his future wife to have survived because she kept it in her engagement scrapbook – the others were lost in one of their many later moves. That's the problem with love letters – there's no backing-up system. Straight to the point: Sophie appeared to scare off her prospective date when she discussed having children so early on in their conversation . ORIGINAL LETTER: . 'This should be a very easy letter to write — words should come easily and in short it should be simple for me to tell you how desperately happy I was to open the paper and see the announcement of our engagement, but somehow I can't possibly say all in a letter I should like to. I love you, precious, with all my heart and to know that you love me means my life. How often I have thought about the immeasurable joy that will be ours some day. How lucky our children will be to have a mother like you...' TINDER CONVERSATION . James: Hi Sophie :-) Sophie: How lucky our children will be to have a father like you . J: Haha indeed . S: How often I have thought about the immeasurable joy that will be ours some day . J: Ok… . Where based? You* . S: Milton, Massachusetts . J: That's quite far away lol I'm in London . S: I love you, precious, with all my heart and to know that you love me means my life . Hopeless romantic. George Bush would write to his wife Barbara while he was away during World War two . J: Great . You sure you're not a bot . S: Fairly . J: When you coming to meet me then? S: I can't possibly say all I should like to . J: What team do you support? S: Arsenal. You? J: Spurs . [BLOCKS ME] . Rating: 6/10 . Lessons: It looks like Tinder is responsive to romance Bush-style (lol), but is definitely not OK with you supporting the wrong football team. Oscar Wilde To Lord Alfred Douglas, 1897 . Love letters between Oscar Wilde and Lord Alfred Douglas were eventually read out in the court case that saw Wilde serve two years for indecency and sodomy. This letter to his lover of six years was written just after Wilde was released from prison and had fled to France. Douglas, who was known as 'Bosie' to his friends, had a tempestuous relationship and would often argue and break up, but would always reconcile. Deep conversation: The confused Tinder user tries to decipher the Oscar Wilde quotes used in this exchange . ORIGINAL LETTER . 'Everyone is furious with me for going back to you, but they don't understand us. I feel that it is only with you that I can do anything at all. Do remake my ruined life for me, and then our friendship and love will have a different meaning to the world. I wish that when we met at Rouen we had not parted at all. There are such wide abysses now of space and land between us. But we love each other.' TINDER CONVERSATION . Mike: How are you? S: Do remake my ruined life for me . M: Would love to . What's happened? S: There are such wide abysses now of space and land between us . M: How long have you been single? Old fashioned love: Oscar Wilde with his lover Lord Alfred Douglas who he used to write to, his letters were eventually used against him in court that saw him spend two years in prison for indecency . S: I feel like it is only with you that I can do anything at all . M: What would you like to do? S: Meet at Rouen? M: Where's Rouen? S: In North-Western France on the River Seine . M: Lovely . Rating: 10/10 . Lessons: We'll get back to you on that one once we're back from Rouen . Frida Kahlo and Diego Rivera, 1940s . This is only one of numerous love letters Frida Kahlo addressed to Diego Rivera in the diary she kept during the 1940s. It speaks of the deep and abiding bond the couple had despite several infidelities (on both sides) and a brief divorce. Confused: This potential Tinder date seems utterly baffled by the topic of conversation . ORIGINAL LETTER . 'Nothing compares to your hands, nothing like the green-gold of your eyes. My body is filled with you for days and days. You are the mirror of the night. The violent flash of lightning. The dampness of the earth. The hollow of your armpits is my shelter. My fingers touch your blood. All my joy is to feel life spring from your flower-fountain that mine keeps to fill all the paths of my nerves which are yours.' TINDER CONVERSATION . Neil: Hey you (smiley face) S: You are the mirror of the night. The violent flash of lightning. The dampness of the earth. N: Huh?! (embarrassed face) Secret love: Frida Kahlo wrote her letters to Diego Rivera in the diary she kept during the 1940s . S: The hollow of your armpit is my shelter . N: hahahahahahahahaha . Wtf are you on? S: My fingers touch your blood . [Blocked] . Rating: 2/10 . Lessons: No matter how intense and painterly you'd like your romance to become, probably best not to mention either blood or armpits within the first ten minutes of meeting someone on Tinder. Useful.

"The number of children who count English as their mother tongue are now in the minority at more than 1,600 schools across England. The new figures show that close to one million children who now attend schools in England do not have English as their first language at home - with the multicultural effects of migration now showing in the nation's classrooms. And the amount of schools with a majority of pupils who do not class English at their home language is steadily increasing by one a week. Classrooms across Britain are becoming more multicultural with one in six youngsters in Primary Schools not having English as a first language . There are 97 schools where children with English as their first language are in such a minority that they make up less than one in twenty pupils. The statistics released by the Department of Education shows that in 1997, when Tony Blair first came to power, there were 866 schools in England where more than 50 per cent of the pupils had English as a second language. Last year that figure had nearly doubled in just 14 years to 1,638 schools. Now there are 1,363 primary schools, 224 secondary schools and 51 special schools where more than half the pupils come from a non-English speaking background. One in six youngsters in primary schools - 547,000 - do not have English as their first language. In secondary schools the figure stands at 400,000 - just over one in eight. A recent study found that Punjabi was the most frequently spoken language among pupils who did not have English as a first language. After that the most popular languages were Urdu, Bengali, Gujarati, Somali, Polish, Arabic, Portuguese, Turkish and Tamil. But schools also have to cope with sizable populations of pupils who speak Shqip from Albania and Kosovo, Igbo from parts of Nigeria, Luganda from Uganda, Sinhala from Sri Lanka and Amharic from Ethiopia. In the 14 boroughs that comprise Inner London, there are 98,000 . schoolchildren whose first language is not English, compared with just . 79,000 who speak English at home. Within the London boroughs, Newham had the highest amount with 79 schools, followed by Tower Hamlets with 70, Brent with 57 and Ealing with 55 schools. London was followed by Birmingham with 117 schools where more than 50 per cent of pupils do not have English as their first language while the borough of Halton in Cheshire had the lowest with just 0.9 per cent. Anastasia De Waal, head of Family and Education at the think tank Civitas, said: 'It is vital that schools are organised in such a way to adequately accommodate pupils who start school in the UK with weak English language foundations. 'In our often highly standardised classroom situations schools are frequently asked to side-step language barriers. 'This significantly and needlessly hampers the progress of those children without secure English, as well as the progress of their peers.' After London and Birmingham, Bradford came next with 59 schools followed by Leicester with 40 schools. Manchester has 35 schools, while Lancashire has 30 schools and Kirklees has 27. Luton has 22 schools and Slough 19. The local authority areas with the smallest proportion of pupils who . have English as a second language are Halton with 0.9 per cent and . Redcar and Cleveland also with 0.9 per cent. They were closely followed by Derbyshire with 1.3 per cent, Rutland 1.5 . with per cent, St Helens with 1.5 per cent, and Cornwall with 1.6 per . cent.",Punjabi is the most frequently spoken language among pupils who do not have English as a first language .
"Jefferson Montero is a name Calum Chambers won't forget in a hurry and he might just stick around in a few other memories after the way he led Swansea to a win over Arsenal on Sunday. To followers of South American football, the only surprise is that it's taken this long for Montero to draw wider attention. For years the Ecuadorian has been hyped as a future star, but so far has only fleetingly lived up to the predictions. Here, Sportsmail offers a guide to the flying winger… . Jefferson Montero (left) gave Arsenal defender Calum Chambers (right) a torrid afternoon on Sunday . Not bad against Arsenal, was he? He was devastating – the most effective player on the pitch. He was helped by Calum Chambers' fatigue, but capitalised to give the 19-year-old right back an awful time. Long before he set up Bafetimbi Gomis's winner, it was obvious that Swansea's plan was to get him on the ball and running at Chambers. It was a brutal mismatch. Tell us about him… . He's Ecuadorian and turned 25 last month having joined Swansea in the summer from Mexican club Monarcas Morelia for roughly £4million. Interestingly, he was actually close to joining Cardiff a year ago. Motero (centre) provided the assist for Bafetimbi Gomis's goal, which proved to be the winner against Arsenal . So this is his big break? Not really. He's been about a bit, including three years in Spain, so this isn't his first taste of life in a big league. He started at Emelec in the Ecuadorian top flight in 2007, before joining Independiente, whom he left for a brief loan spell at Dorados in Mexico. He joined Villarreal in 2009 but struggled in Spain. He was often understudy to Santi Cazorla and was sent out on loan to Levante and Real Betis. He was a key part of the Pepe Mel-led Betis squad, but returned to Mexico in 2012 to join Morelia, where he won the Copa MC: Apertura 2013. Montero (left) featured in all three games for Ecuador during their 2014 World Cup campaign in Brazil . So he's been around. And he was at the World Cup as well, right? Yes. He played all three of Ecuador's games in Brazil as they finished third in Group E. He made his Ecuador debut in 2007, aged 18, and was part of the side that won the Pan American Games that year – Ecuador's first international trophy. He has played 48 games for the national side, scoring eight. What's his style? As you saw on Sunday, he is rapid and an old-school, touchline-hugging left winger, yet a natural right footer. He can play on either flank but tends to be used on the left, even if that does mean he occasionally slows moves down by cutting inside. His pace is certainly his main weapon. At Swansea there are numerous speedsters – Wayne Routledge, Nathan Dyer and Curtis Obeng (on loan at Newport County) are all very quick. But Montero is believed by many at the club to be quickest of all. He loves to run at players but despite his excellence against Chambers his final ball has not always impressed since he arrived in Wales. Montero (centre) has been an essential component in the Swansea team that is fifth in the Premier League . How has he settled in? At 5ft 7ins, he fits in perfectly with Routledge in the sense that he is small and quick. But he has not been a first-choice starter by any means, with Routledge and Dyer get far more game time. He didn't start a Premier League game until the win over Leicester on October 25. In fact, the win over Arsenal was only his third league start, but crucially his third in succession. He seems to have broken through, even if Garry Monk did reveal on Sunday that Routledge and Dyer have injuries. His other eight league appearances have come from the bench, typically after 65 minutes, but started all three of their Capital One Cup games. Any other standout performances? Yes. No-one who was there will forget the mauling he gave Everton's Tony Hibbert in Swansea's cup win in September. And within moments of coming off the bench against Manchester United in the first game of the season he made the winning goal. Montero (right) celebrates as Gylfi Sigurdsson (centre) equalises for Swansea against Arsenal on Sunday . Montero will now be looking to score his first goal in Swansea colours since his summer transfer . There is no doubting that there are currently limitations to Montero's game – he is also yet to score for Swansea - but if he goes against a vulnerable full-back who can't match his pace, it's brutal. What next? He will be hoping to retain his form and place after the international break. Routledge will be back in training this week and Dyer won't train for seven or so days, but should be back after the international break. It will be interesting to see if Monk sticks with him when he has all his aces available and rested.","Jefferson Montero gave Arsenal defender Calum Chambers a torrid game .

"Last month, Oscar-winning filmmaker Malik Bendjelloul committed suicide by throwing himself in front of a train at Stockholm's Solna Centrum station during rush hour. Malik Bendjelloul's untimely death at the age of 36 came just a year after he won an Academy Award for his ground-breaking documentary 'Searching for Sugar Man' and initially bewildered many friends. But those close to Bendjelloul witnessed a dramatic change of attitude in recent months, as the Swedish director dealt with his new-found celebrity and struggled to find another passion project. 'I know he had been depressed for a short period and depression is something you can die from,' his older brother Johar Bendjelloul announced the following day. 'But the question of why, no one can answer; it will ache in my chest the rest of my life.' Still, the sudden suicide shocked other friends, like Karin afKlintberg who called Bendjelloul the 'happiest person I knew'. 'If I think of every person I've met in my whole life, he was the least likely to take his life -- the least,' Klinterberg told the Hollywood Reporter. Descent into depression: Swedish filmmaker Malik Bendjelloul committed suicide last month, a year after he won the Academy Award for best documentary. Pictured above receiving the award . End of the line: Bendjelloul committed suicide by throwing himself in front of a train at Stockholm's Solna Centrum subway station. Above, one of the platforms at the station . Last days: Bendjelloul's friends told the Hollywood Reporter how he had become increasingly isolated lonely in his last year of life . While none of his friends or family know what plagued Benjelloul for certain, they did notice changes in his personality following the crazy success of Sugar Man, a documentary about a long-lost South African musical icon found living in poverty in Detroit. Benjelloul poured his heart into the documentary, working on it for five years. But after winning the Academy Award for the film, he didn't know what to do next. Before his death, he had been living for months in New York, writing for a new project on a South African conservationist. But the big city had turned Benjelloul into an insomniac and he confessed to at least one close friend that he felt lonely. Early in May, he returned home to Sweden where he met with Klintberg, and she offered him a new project to work on, which she thought would be a good transition from Sugar Man. He started work on May 5, but the very next day wrote Klintberg saying he wasn't interested in the project anymore. 'I can't come in to do this,' Bendjelloul told her. 'I want to have a small challenge, not too big a challenge.' Bendjelloul would die exactly a week later. Friends believe that it was his challenge finding a new project after such early success that might have caused him to sink into mental illness. 'In [my limited exposure to depression, it's the darkness, it's completely like there's no hope,' Benjelloul's mentor Per Sinding Larsen said. 'I was wondering if there was something that made him go up and down, but which he dealth with through his work, his movie - and suddently there wasn't anything. There was a silent period. And so the darkness comes up.' Up all night: Recently, Bendjelloul had been living in New York working on a new project, but had developed insomnia . There were also certain eccentricities that may have been clues of a deeper, lingering mental illness. Benjelloul had a strict work regimen, involving a lap around his apartment at the beginning and end of the work day. He would also write uninterrupted every day from 8am to noon. And if he slept in, he would turn the clocks back to 8am so he wouldn't be thrown off his routine. These habits extended outside of work as well. Friends say he would eat the same breakfast every day just for the thrill of being able to change the meal after six months. And one time, he broke up with a girlfriend to end the relationship at exactly four years, four months and four days. 'It always seemed totally reasonable when he said it,' recalls Klintberg. 'He was very convincing.' In retrospect, Kilntberg says these habits may have been a way to distract from deeper issues. 'It was like he was creating ways to not be disappointed,' she said, 'so he wasn't disappointed, until now. And when it came, it struck him so hard because he wasn't used to it. I think that this [depression] was a total shock for him and very unexpected. He didn't have the tools to handle this situation. It was like a psychosis, I think. Bendjelloul's Oscar-winning film is about a South African musical legend found living in poverty in Detroit . Searching for Sugar Man, which detailed the life and career of American singer Sixto Rodriguez, won the Oscar for best documentary in 2013. He also won the BAFTA, Director's Guild of America, Producer's Guild of America, Writer's Guild of America and Sundance audience award. Bendjelloul grew up in central and southern Sweden as the child of a painter and a translator. He acted in Swedish TV-series Ebba and Didrik as a child during the 1990s. He studied journalism and media-production at the Linnaeus University of Kalmar in southern Sweden and later worked as a reporter for Swedish public broadcaster SVT. He resigned from that job to travel the world and he got the idea for Searching for Sugar Man during one of his trips. Bendjelloul directed, produced, edited and co-wrote the 2012 film that chronicles two South Africans who set out to find their folk music hero . •  For confidential help, call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255 or visit http://www.suicidepreventionlifeline.org/ .","Malik Bendjelloul, 36, committed suicide on May 13 by throwing himself in front of a subway train at Stockholm's Solna Centrum station .

"A Slovenian designer has created a range of hand crafted pinhole cameras carved out of chestnut and maple wood and held together using just magnets. The Ondu cameras come in six different dimensions and film sizes ranging from the Leica 135 format to the 4""x5"" film holder camera. They were created by Elvis Halilovic and his brother Benjamin in a design studio just outside Velenje in Slovenia. Scroll down for video . A Slovenian designer has created a range of pinhole cameras carved out of chestnut and maple wood. The Ondu cameras are held together by magnets and come in six different dimensions and film sizes ranging from Leica 135 format to the 4""x5"" film holder camera, pictured . Prices for the Ondu cameras start at £46 for the 135 Pocket Pinhole, pictured. It is the brainchild of photographer Elvis Halilovi¿ who makes the cameras in a design studio in Velenje, Slovenia. The project was funded through a Kickstarter campaign . A pinhole camera is a camera without a lens. It has a small hole in one side that acts as an aperture to let in light. When . you point the camera at an object, light from the object travels through the hole and projects an inverted . image on the film along the opposite side of the box. This technique is similar to how eyes see and process images. The smaller the hole, the sharper the image, yet the dimmer it will appear. A pinhole camera's shutter is manually operated by a flap of card, for example. Halilovic makes all the wooden parts . of the cameras himself but some parts, like the pins that rewind the . film, and the pinhole require precise CNC machining. There's . only one screw in the design and the winding pins and backplate are . held in place with neodymium magnets that have a pulling force of about . 0.5 kg a piece. Prices start at £46 and the project was funded through a Kickstarter campaign that raised more than 10 times its target. He launched the Kickstarter campaign in May and raised more than £72,000 - from a target of just £6,500. Halilovic said: 'In pinhole photography we use small . tiny pinhole-sized aperture which we drill with a precision drill, that . lets light through to the same material. The wooden pinhole camera from Ondu on the work-bench at the company's design studio in Lopatnik village near Velenje in Slovenia. Founder of Ondu, Elvis Halilovic used crowdsourcing website Kickstarter to achieve the funding needed to turn his hobby into a business . 'And, because it has such a high . aperture, this tiny hole, it produces unique images that no other kind . of photographic camera can achieve.' 'When you take a picture with a pinhole . camera not only the photographer is involved, but also the subject. 'Because exposing images with this kind of cameras takes a little bit . longer than just taking a snapshot, so the people that get photographed . with these cameras get away with an experience.' Each of the Ondu cameras are carved by hand in a workshop by designer Halilovic and his brother Benjamin. Halilovic claims he can make about 100 cameras a week . Film is loaded inside each model and a single metal screw holds the shutter in place. The smallest camera in the Ondu range is the 135 Pocket Pinhole camera that costs £46. It has a pinhole size of 0.20 mm, a focal length of 25mm, and comes with a standard tripod mount. The 135 Panoramic Pinhole costs £60 and shoots Leica format in 36mm x 24mm or panoramic double frames at 72mm x 24mm image. It also has a 0.20mm pinhole size and 25mm focal length with an added field of view of 113° for panoramic shots. Film is loaded inside each Ondu camera model and a single metal screw holds the shutter in place. The back of each camera is attached using small magnets . Elvis Halilovic uses a wooden pinhole camera to take photo in Lopatnik village near Velenje, in Slovenia. The cameras, made from walnut and maple, come in six formats and range in price from £60 for a 135 format to £132 for a slidebox that holds the paper in place . Ondu's 6x6 Pocket Pinhole costs £73 and uses 120 format film which makes the negatives 56mm x 56mm and has a 115° angle of view. Ondu's 6x12 Multiformat camera can take 6x6, 6x9, and 6x12 images and costs £92. Halilovic claims the cameras produce similar looking results as the 135 Panoramic but with 'much greater clarity', thanks to the 120roll film. The camera has a pinhole size of 0.30 mm, a focal length of 40 mm and a standard tripod mount. For £106 photographers can buy a standard 4"" x 5"" film holder that is secured onto the back of any of the other cameras with magnets. Elvis Halilovic poses as a wooden pinhole camera is used to take his photo at the Ondu design and fabrication studio in Lopatnik village, Velenje. Each of the six Ondu models comes with a standard tripod mount, pictured . This picture is the image taken using the Ondu camera of designer Halilovic in his studio. A pinhole camera is a camera without a lens. It has a small hole in one side that acts as an aperture to let in light. When you point the camera at an object, light from the object travels through the hole and projects an inverted image on the film . This camera has a 0.30 mm pinhole, a focal length of 60 mm and a standard tripod mount. The most expensive camera in the range costs £132 and is made with two sliding boxes that hold the paper in place for the exposure. This means an image is produced before the camera film is developed into a darkroom, or before the paper in the changing bag is removed. It uses a paper format of 10,5 x 14,8cm, has a  0.3 mm pinhole and a 50 mm focal length. Halilovis said: 'Nowadays, most of us own a camera and taking a picture has become such an everyday occurrence that we don't take notice anymore. 'Well, pinhole photography changes that. 'Suddenly, you remember what you were doing on the day you took the picture in detail, who approached you to ask about your camera, how you took the shot, and how you felt when you developed the film - all the things missing in today's photography.' Halilovic makes all the wooden parts of the cameras himself but some parts, like the pins that rewind the film, and the pinhole require precise CNC machining. There's only one screw in the design and the winding pins and backplate are held in place with neodymium magnets that have a pulling force of about 0.5 kg a piece .","The Ondu cameras are carved out of chestnut and maple wood .

'I am supposed to feel safe at school, but I didn’t feel safe.I contacted my mom because I was hearing that I was going to be jumped by this girl and her sister,' she told KTXL-TV. The video shows Adayja taking the first swing at the girl who seemed to be leading the mob that had gathered outside her house. She says she was tired of being bullied. Quickly, Adayja was pulled into a scrum of punching, screaming and hair-pulling by the mob of teenage girls. When her eighth-grade sister tried to intervene, she was drawn into the fight and beaten, too. Finally, Adayja's mother Alicia Henderson intervened to stop the violence. 'If a situation like this happens and they are at home, I’m not sending them to school,' she said. The two girls escaped with minor scratches and bruises. School officials responded by suspending Adayja and her sister for the fight. However, the school district police department is investigating the fight and could bring criminal charges against the students involved.

"Police say they've flushed out a man accused of stealing the handles and pipes of toilets in parks and restaurant restrooms around a Florida city. St. Petersburg police said Friday that they arrested 28-year-old homeless man Brian Rinda. He is accused of stealing the plumbing from Cracker Barrel, Burger King, Bob Evans and other restaurants. Police released a photo of a pile of metal toilet parts that they say Rinda stole. Brian Rinda is accused of stealing the handles and pipes of toilets in parks and restaurant restrooms around St. Petersburg, Fla. 'He worked very fast within a matter of minutes,' police spokesperson Yolanda Fernandez told FOX 13 News regarding a theft at Subway. 'Many of the managers at the restaurants were telling us, well they had just walked out of the restroom and gone back in a few minutes later, and he had taken the flush valves.' Police say Rinda caused about $1,000 in damage and traded the brass valve and piping at a county recycling center. As most commercial victims had security cameras, there is plenty of footage of Rinda taking off with the handles and pipes. As scrap metal yards must keep seller records, authorities can tie Rinda to multiple deals at County Recycling. Rinda is charged him with eight counts of grand theft and 1 count of petit theft . Owner James Roberto identified him personally, noting that in one transaction Rinda was paid $32 for 20 pounds of brass. Roberto read on his records: 'that was the item, and there's the picture ID, his picture, his fingerprint. Rinda was charged with eight counts of grand theft and 1 count of petit theft. Rinda is being held in county jail on $20,000 bail. It's unclear whether he retained an attorney.","28-year-old homeless man Brian Rinda is accused of stealing the plumbing from Cracker Barrel, Burger King, Bob Evans .

"Rule 40 in the International Olympic Committee's guidebook states that no athlete is able to participate in non-Olympic marketing during the Games and a specified period afterwards . The Louis Vuitton ads surfaced on Twitter and various websites on August 13, which fell within the banned time frame . As the most decorated Olympian of all time, it was only a matter of time before Michael Phelps landed a major fashion endorsement. But in posing for the Louis Vuitton campaign images that surfaced on Twitter on August 13, 2012, the U.S. Olympic swimmer may be stripped of his medals, four gold and two silver, from the London 2012 Games. According to Rule 40, a regulation introduced by the International Olympic Committee earlier this year, no athlete was able to participate in non-Olympic marketing campaigns from July 18 to August 15, 2012. Champions: Michael Phelps may lose his medals as his ads for Louis Vuitton (above) were unveiled at a time he was unable to participate in non-Olympic marketing. He's seen in a bath with the brand's bag beside him . Champions: Mr Phelps is also seen in another leaked image with former Soviet gymnast Larisa Latynina (left) If the photographs were in fact due for . release on August 16 and a rogue individual had simply leaked them, Mr . Phelps will be in the clear. But if the photos were in fact leaked . intentionally by the brand, the sporting hero will face punishment. The French fashion house said after the two photos, snapped by famed photographer Annie Leibovitz, had leaked that they were in fact unofficial images and were stolen from the company. Mr Phelps' management team have also denied releasing the images. The official IOC rule states: 'A competitor or a team may lose the benefit of any ranking obtained in relation to other events at the Olympic Games at which he or it was disqualified or excluded; in such case the medals and diplomas won by him or it shall be returned to the IOC.' Two photographs of the athlete were posted on various websites on August 13. One showed Mr Phelps posing in a bathtub . as the brand's signature bag sat slumped on the floor beside him while . another showed him on a couch, sharing a laugh with former Soviet . gymnast Larissa Latynina, 77. As a less severe punishment, Mr Phelps may also simply be fined if he is found to have breached Rule 40. According to Sekou Campbell, an . intellectual property attorney at Fox Rothschild who has written about . Rule 40, if the photos were leaked intentionally, it is likely a . violation of the IOC regulation designed to combat ambush marketing. Winner: The star won four gold medals and two silver medals at the London 2012 Olympic Games . ‘That’s the point of ambush marketing,’ he told CNBC. ‘There’s no formal ad, but they somehow generate coverage.’ Phelps' long-time agent, Peter Carlisle, dismissed any suggestion Friday that the retired swimmer may have violated Rule 40. Carlisle told The Associated Press there's no issue with the IOC because Phelps did not authorize use of the pictures, which were leaked by a source that still isn't known and appeared on several websites. In fact, the agent added, there are dozens of similar, unapproved uses of most top athletes' names and images during any Olympics. ‘He didn't violate Rule 40; it's as simple as that,’ Carlisle said in a telephone interview. ‘All that matters is whether the athlete permitted that use. That's all he can control. In this case, Michael did not authorize that use. ‘The images hadn't even been reviewed, much less approved. It's as simple as that. An athlete can't control unauthorized uses any more than you can guarantee someone isn't going to break into your house.’ ‘I can't count on every hand in this office the number of unauthorized uses that happen during the Games period,’ Carlisle added. ‘We uncover them by the dozens. Some are by companies we don't even know. It happens constantly.’ No matter the outcome, the star has followed in the footsteps of Sean Connery and Catherine Deneuve, posing with the French label's famous monogrammed bags in the couch image. The caption beneath, which is written in Italian, bears the words: 'Due percorsi straordinari. Uno stesso destino', which translates as: 'Two extraordinary paths. The same fate.'

"Ghana football captain and former Premier League player Asamoah Gyan has dismissed claims he killed a friend in a black magic human sacrifice ritual as 'wild and ludicrous allegations'. Ghanaian rapper Castro, whose real name is Theophilus Tagoe, disappeared, along with friend Janet Bandu, in July. They went missing on a jet ski during a weekend trip that had been organised by Gyan in the coastal town of Ada, in Ghana. Former Sunderland striker Asamoah Gyan has dismissed claims he killed a friend in a black magic ritual . Castro and Bandu were last seen heading towards the ocean together on a jet ski and were presumed drowned. But allegations in the media began to suggest the disappearance was suspicious. Rumours circulated that Gyan had either murdered Castro or had him kidnapped - and even suggested he sacrificed him spiritually to enhance his own career. No bodies were recovered and rumours continued  this month when Gyan's brother and fellow Ghana footballer, Baffour Gyan, was alleged to have been part of a gang which attacked a journalist who had asked the player about the rumours. The assault charges on Baffour Gyan, who plays for Al-Nasr Benghazi in Libya, have now been dropped. The footballer was bought by Sunderland for a club record £13m in 2010 (left) and is Ghana's national captain . The speculation prompted Gyan, who joined United Arab Emirates side Al-Ain from Premier League club Sunderland in 2011, to hold a press conference. He explained he had not spoken earlier because he did not want to interfere with police investigations and also because of the assault charges levelled against his brother. In a statement, his lawyer Kissi Agyabeng read: 'In our painful silence, we have been totally dismayed by the fact that the platform was provided for the peddling of these wild and ludicrous allegations and rumours against us. 'Those to whom the platform was provided offered no evidence whatsoever to back their statements. And indeed, the allegation of spiritual sacrifice can by no stretch of the imagination be propped up. 'The startling development has been the outbursts of persons who should know better. 'Indeed, one such person has gone has far as to claim that he knows where Castro is being kept and that Asamoah Gyan also knows where Castro is being kept. He also made the unfortunate statement that we have bribed Castro's family to keep silent over the matter. Castro's father has publicly denied this. This is no way to treat grieving families and friends.' The speculation prompted the former Premier League striker to hold a press conference . Gyan joined United Arab Emirates side Al-Ain from Sunderland in 2011 and is paid more than £6million a season . He went on to say: 'Admittedly, the net effect of the peddling of these wild allegations and rumours is that the word on the street is that we had a hand in the disappearance of Castro and Janet Bandu. 'This is how a person's reputation gets ruined and this is how disaffection gets sowed in the minds of persons against the person who is being attacked so unfairly. 'Perhaps we should have come out earlier. But I have already explained why we could not. 'Now, we take the opportunity and state without the slightest doubt in our minds that we are not blamable for the disappearance of Castro and Janet Bandu. 'We had no hand in that occurrence. We have no moral or legal culpability whatsoever. 'We do not know Janet Bandu that well. However, we do know that from the time we met her on July 4 2014 till her disappearance on July 6 2014, she proved herself to be a well mannered and graceful lady. We have no ill will against her. 'We know Castro all too well. He was our brother. We loved him as one of our own. We did everything together with him. 'You are all witnesses to the hit songs Castro has been featuring Asamoah Gyan on and the added popularity that gave him. Indeed, the duo were just about to release another song. We will never do anything to harm him.'","Asamoah Gyan denies killing friend in a black magic sacrifice ritual .

"More than a century after it was first observed by astronomers a star has been identified as the oldest yet seen in the universe. The star is just 186 light years away from Earth and is at least 13.2 billion years old, and quite possibly many millions of years older than that. The Big Bang is calculated by scientists to have taken place about 13.77 billion years ago and the star, known only as HD 140283, was among the earliest stars to form. An artist's impression of how the oldest known star in the universe might look . 'We believe this star is the oldest known in the Universe with a well determined age,' Howard Bond, an astronomer at Pennsylvania State University, told the American Astronomical Society. Because it contains some heavy elements it is thought to have been one of the second generation of stars to be created following the Big Bang. The first generation of stars contained hardly any elements heavier than helium but when they exploded in a succession of supernovas within a few hundred million years after forming they were replaced by stars like HD 140283. Observations from the Hubble Telescope helped researchers fix the distance of the star from the Earth with unprecedented accuracy which allowed them to make more accurate measurements of how brightly it shines. Once its brightness was established they were able to work out how rapidly its hydrogen is being exhausted and so determine its age. When stars start running short of hydrogen they start dimming which is regarded as a reliable indicator of age. An image revealing the universe's temperature differences 380,000 years after the Big Bang . The actual age that the astronomers’ calculations gave was 13.9 billion years but calculations of this type usually contain large error margins. In the case of HD 140283 the error margin was 700 million years, making it at least 13.2 billion years old. One other star, known as Methuselah2, has previously been shown to be 13.2 billion years old but the research team are confident they have determined HD 140283’s age with greater certainty.","Star known as HD 140283 has been observed for more than a century .

"Federal investigators have said that the pickup truck left abandoned by Jose Alejandro Sanchez-Ramirez was not stuck at a railroad crossing in Oxnard, California, on Tuesday morning. Federal investigators have said that the pickup truck left abandoned on railway tracks that caused the derailment of a Los Angeles-bound commuter train was not stuck at a railroad crossing. The truck caused a train crash that derailed three cars and sent 30 to hospital. Four people are in a critical condition, including the train's engineer. 'It was not stuck, it was not bottomed out on the track or something like that,' National Transportation Safety Board member Robert Sumwalt said at a media briefing late on Tuesday. 'We're very concerned about that, we're very interested in it,' he said, adding that both the badly wrecked truck's emergency brake and high-beams headlights were on. However a lawyer working for the driver of the truck claims that Jose Alejandro Sanchez-Ramirez did 'all he could' to free the vehicle from the tracks and then ran for help before the crash that injured dozens. Attorney Ron Bamieh told the  Ventura County Star that a preliminary investigation conducted by his firm showed the truck became entangled on the railroad tracks and 'somehow stuck' before the crash on Tuesday. Bamieh said that Sanchez-Ramirez accidentally drove onto the tracks and then made things worse by driving farther to try to get enough speed to get over the rails. Scroll down for video . Three cars of the Southern California Metrolink commuter train derailed and tumbled onto their sides after the collision on tracks in Ventura County, northwest of Los Angeles . Workers walk near a Metrolink train engine from a train that hit a truck and then derailed on Tuesday in Oxnard, California . Bamieh says the Arizona man then tried pushing the vehicle before putting on his high beams and running for his life before impact. Police arrested Ramirez on a charge of leaving the scene of an accident with injuries, but Bamieh said he went for help in Oxnard, about 65 miles northwest of downtown Los Angeles. Sanchez-Ramirez was found about a half-mile away from the crash 45 minutes later, said Jason Benites, an assistant chief of the Oxnard Police Department. He's was briefly hospitalized before being arrested on suspicion of felony hit-and-run. Sanchez-Ramirez, 54, of Yuma, Arizona, didn't call authorities because he was 'in shock' and didn't even realize he had a phone on him, Bamieh said. Ramirez only speaks Spanish, and two people he encountered could not understand him, the lawyer said. Police arrested Ramirez on a charge of leaving the scene of an accident with injuries, but Bamieh said he went for help in Oxnard, about 65 miles northwest of downtown Los Angeles . Flames engulfed the driver's Ford F-450 pickup, but investigators said the engine was intact and may offer clues about what happened . Federal investigators said preliminary reports countered remarks by officials immediately after the crash that the truck got stuck on the tracks. Police said they tested Sanchez-Ramirez for drugs and alcohol but would not discuss the results. Criminal records in his home state of Arizona show Sanchez-Ramirez pleaded guilty in 1998 to a host of violations in a single DUI case, including driving with a blood-alcohol content above .08 percent — the legal limit in the state — failure to obey a police officer, having liquor with a 'minor on the premises' and having no insurance, the Los Angeles Times reported on Wednesday. In 2004, Ramirez was convicted of a local driving infraction in Yuma, and in 2007, he was cited for failure to obey a traffic control device. In the Tuesday crash, flames engulfed his Ford F-450 pickup, but investigators said the engine was intact and may offer clues about what happened. Lives were likely saved by passenger cars designed to absorb a crash that were purchased after a deadly collision a decade ago, Metrolink officials said . The track also used by freight and Amtrak trains was restored to service around 9 a.m. on Wednesday, and commuter trains would begin rolling again in the evening, Metrolink said. Passenger Joel Bingham said many of those aboard the train on Tuesday were asleep and shocked awake when the loud boom first happened. 'It seemed like an eternity while we were flying around the train. Everything was flying,' Bingham said. 'A brush of death definitely came over me.' Eight people were admitted to the hospital of the 30 people originally examined, officials said. Lives were likely saved by passenger cars designed to absorb a crash that were purchased after a deadly collision a decade ago, Metrolink officials said. The four passenger cars remained largely intact, as did the locomotive. A firefighter crawls out of a passenger train car at the scene of a Metrolink accident, Tuesday,  in Oxnard, California . The NTSB planned to examine the effectiveness of those cars, Sumwalt said. The train, the first of the morning on the Ventura route, had just left its second stop of Oxnard on its way to downtown Los Angeles when it struck the truck around 5:45 a.m. The engineer saw the abandoned vehicle and hit the brakes, but there wasn't enough time to stop, Oxnard Fire Battalion Chief Sergio Martinez said. The crossing has been the scene of many crashes over the years. After one killed 11 people and injured 180 others in Glendale in 2005, Metrolink invested heavily in passenger cars with collapsible bumpers and other features to absorb impact. Metrolink spokesman Jeff Lustgarten said the Oxnard crash showed the technology worked. 'Safe to say it would have been much worse without it,' he said. Tuesday's crash happened on the same line as Metrolink's worst disaster, which left 25 people dead on Sept. 12, 2008. A commuter train engineer was texting and ran a red light, striking a Union Pacific freight train head-on in the San Fernando Valley community of Chatsworth.

"New York faces the prospect of being without power for a week today after Superstorm Sandy caused mass blackouts and triggered a series of explosions. In total, more than six million Americans across the Eastern Seaboard have been affected after the devastation wreaked by Superstorm Sandy caused power cuts on an unprecedented scale. In New York alone, more than 600,000 residents are without power after an explosion at a Manhattan power plant. Scroll down for video . Blast: The initial explosion can be seen next to the silhouetted power station . Flare: The amateur video footage shows an enormous ball of light immediately following the initial explosion . Blinding: The explosion happened at a transformer at the Consolidated Edison power plant on the East Side . Con Edison, the utilities company that provides power to 3.3million customers in metropolitan New York, as well as a further 301,000 in southeastern New York and northern New Jersey, said around 50,000 power outages in downtown Manhattan in . Battery Park and the Financial District were part of a planned cut and will take around three days to restore. But much of the damage was caused by the explosion at the 14th street power station will take up to a week to repair as restoring electrical service to underground equipment requires the cleaning away of sea water to . all components, drying and testing to make it safe to . restore power. In addition to the flood waters, heavy winds have downed power lines across the region. A company statement said: 'Con Edison is reporting power outages to a large section of Manhattan stretching from East 39th Street to the lower tip of Manhattan. 'The outage was caused by flooding in company substations and engineers are working to correct the problem. 'This will be one for the record books,' said John Miksad, senior vice president for electric operation at Con Edison. 'This will be the largest storm-related outage in our history.' The previous record was more than 200,000 customers affected by Hurricane Irene in 2011, the company added. In the dark: This Con Edison graphic shows the location of power cuts across the New York area . Crippled: The Long Island Power Authority has blanket supply problems . The company released that 193,000 customers have lost power in Manhattan, 158,000 in Westchester County, 74,000 in Queens, 71,000 in Brooklyn, 76,000 in Staten Island and 38,000 in the Bronx as of 1am Tuesday. Because a customer is defined as an individual meter, the actual number of people affected is much higher. Con Ed spokesman Alfonso Quiroz told the New York Daily News that company 'storm riders' were monitoring water levels and that when they reached a certain threshold the order would be passed along to cut power. He said: 'If the water level comes to a certain point we will have to preemptively power some equipment down,' Quiroz said. 'It makes it easier and faster for us to make restorations. If we don’t, it will burn out.' ConEd also cut steam service to 140 customers in Manhattan. If steam pipes become inundated in cold water, they can explode. Mr Miksad said the cuts caused by downed overhead power lines outside major cities could be the trickiest to repair. 'The overhead is going to be a slog,' he said. In New Jersey, more than 1,900,000 residents are without power, 800,000 in Long Island, 640,000 in Connecticut, 390,000 in Virginia, 290,000 in Maryland and Washington DC, 68,000 in West Virginia, 10,000 in Massachusetts and 125,000 in New Hampshire. In all, 6,536,895 customers are without power and the number of outages could still go up as the storm continues. Night city: The New York skyline remains dark. Power was cut to much of Manhattan to minimise damage from saltwater . Shadows: Sixth Avenue in Chelsea during the blackout. It could take a week to restore power . 'This will be the largest storm-related outage in our history,' said one power executive . After a back-up generator failed, New York University's Tisch Hospital began evacuating more than 200 patients to other facilities, including 20 babies from neonatal intensive care, some of them on respirators operating on battery power. Without power, the hospital had no elevator service, meaning patients had to be carefully carried down staircases and outside into the weather. Gusts of wind blew their blankets as nurses held IVs and other equipment. Spokeswoman Lorinda Klein said: 'They evacuated everybody.' She could not say what had caused the failure of the hospital’s emergency systems, which power critical care units there. Many New Yorkers took to the streets to experience the city as it's rarely seen - dark. 'It’s not too often you get to see the city dark,' Greg Pearl, 26, an accountant who was taking pictures on the East Side told the New York Post. 'I haven’t seen lower Manhattan shut down before. It’s kind of amusing,' said Jonathan Lee, 25, who walked across the Williamsburg Bridge. 'It’s like an apocalypse, like a movie,' added his friend Paul Parhar. The . huge explosion took place at a power station on 14th Street around 8.30pm, . knocking out power to tens of thousands of customers in the surrounding . areas, and it could take a week to restore power. Amateur video footage shows a fiery . explosion followed by two large bursts of blue light at the Consolidated . Edison station on the east side of Manhattan, close to the river. According a local TV station Pix 11, blue sparks were shooting from the plant and the buildings fell into darkness. People living in Brooklyn posted . cameraphone videos online of the incident. It was initially thought that workers were trapped inside, but Con Edison's vice-president later told DNAinfo.com that no one was in or on the building. Blackness: Another New Yorker filmed the explosion from a different angle . The initial fireball was followed by two blinding balls of light. Most of the island below 39 Street is without power . A power company exec called it 'the largest storm-related outage in our history' Con Edison engineers were working to . restore power to an estimated quarter of a million people in Manhattan . who were now without power for at least seven hours. 'It was scary!' said Maritza Mercado, 40, on East 6th Street. 'I was watching TV, looked outside the window and heard a big explosion and saw a big flash of white light like a firecracker.'

"She won our hearts as Bridget Jones, by committing the unthinkable in Hollywood and gaining enough weight to be both apple-cheeked and pear-shaped. So you can understand why so many fans have expressed dismay at Renee Zellweger’s latest look. This weekend the actress – now size 6 – appeared at a fashion event in New York showing off chiselled cheekbones, a heavy brow and a peculiarly smooth forehead. She was almost unrecognisable from the granny-pant-wearing Bridget. So what’s happened? Changes: Renee Zellweger's chiselled cheekbones, heavy brow and smooth forehead render her almost unrecognisable from her apple-cheeked look in 2007 . Although her management decline to comment, one Twitter commentator remarked that she looked like she’d been ‘hit with a shovel of Botox’. Suspicions about surgical intervention notwithstanding, Renee is looking positively radiant these days. And that’s largely down to a huge change in her lifestyle. The 44-year-old has walked away from her acting career, favouring instead a stint as a director and producer, which has done wonders for her stress levels and love life. New love: Renee and guitarist Doyle Bramall started dating almost a year ago, and were spotted on a romantic holiday in Hawaii together in February . Renee has hinted that she felt close . to a breakdown during her years on the A list, during which she suffered . the humiliation of a 128-day marriage to country star Kenny Chesney in . 2005. Chesney has since said that he 'panicked' after their impulsive ceremony in the Virgin Islands. Renee later remarked: ‘I made the biggest mistake of my personal life. I felt a failure. I was looking for something else. ‘I just needed to put acting aside. I needed to sit still and not to worry about the dresses and the hair and the travel and the interviews. I was going through huge life changes at the time. I wanted to stop and be a girl for a while.’ After the Chesney disaster there was a heavy – if unlikely – flirtation with Sir Paul McCartney, in 2007 plus a liaison with celebrity hotelier Andre Balazs, and another with comedian John Krasinski, her co-star in Leatherheads. Her 30s and early 40s passed from one short romance to another, with actor Bradley Cooper and rockstar Jack White of the White Stripes among her beaus. The parallels to Bridget Jones were often remarked on, a comparison which enraged and appalled Renee: ‘I’m not single, I’m busy,’ she told an interviewer, who enquired after her love life, before grimacing sardonically, ‘That’s my line.’ And now? Well, very quietly, Renee has found a new man. And at the relatively advanced age of 44, she believes that she has finally found ‘The One’. The man in question is tall, dark and handsome blues guitarist Doyle Bramhall, with whom she was at university in Austin, Texas. It is an unlikely match. While  Renee is clean living, Bramhall is an ex-heroin addict who once confessed: ‘I thought it was cool to be a tough drinker and drug addict. Familiar face: As Bridget Jones in 2004 sequel The Edge of Reason with Hugh Grant and Colin Firth . ‘From my experience, I think it is hereditary, and I think it gets worse every generation, especially alcoholism. ‘I work constantly on my personal life and go to therapy and AA meetings.’ His ex-wife is the musician Susannah Melvoin, a member of Prince’s entourage in the Nineties, with whom he has two daughters. Regrets: Following her 128-day marriage to country star Kenny Chesney, Renee said she 'felt a failure' Bramhall and Renee started dating almost a year ago, and were spotted on a romantic holiday in Hawaii together in February. So what’s the attraction? ‘Renee has always had a thing about musicians,’ a friend tells me, ‘and she thinks that this was fated to be, for them to find each other again after all these years.’ Recent reports suggest that the pair are contemplating adopting a child. A friend told the website RadarOnline: ‘She knows that she probably missed the boat on carrying and giving birth to a child. ‘Renee tries to find the positive side of things, she knows 44 isn’t too old to be a mum. It will just have to happen a little differently than she always imagined it would.’ In the immediate future, Renee will appear in one more film, 4½ Minutes.

"It is a sight that will cheer campaigners across the land. After blighting the Yorkshire Dales for more than two decades, four giant turbines have been removed from the stunning landscape – the first ever windfarm in Britain to be scrapped. To the delight of residents and walkers there are once again unspoilt views across the rolling hills and deep blue waters of Chelker Reservoir, near Ilkley. Eyesore: The four turbines near Addingham, Yorkshire, were the subject of years of anti-windfarm campaigns before their removal . And to their relief, the 150ft high turbines will not be replaced after the council refused permission for two even bigger machines. The eyesores were put up in 1992 by Yorkshire Water to power the reservoir’s pumping stations in the face of fierce local opposition. But according to campaigners, the turbines have not worked in years. In an unprecedented move, the utility company sent in contractors at the end of last month to dismantle the rusting structures. Peter Rigby, who set up the Parishioners Against the Chelker Turbines, said: ‘This is a real David versus Goliath victory for residents - and the democratic process won out. There was almost unanimous feeling among the parishes that these eyesores were not wanted. ‘We have been told it is the first time in Europe that a wind farm of this scale has been taken down and not replaced.’ Now: The locals have finally got their view back after the 150ft winds turbines at Chelker Reservoir wind have been dismantled . He added: ‘It’s been a hell of a fight but we have proved it is possible to stop wind farms. ‘In recent years the turbines have hardly ever worked - they have turned the area into an industrial graveyard and look like rotting tooth stumps. ‘We have always opposed them - and plans for any replacements - on the grounds of health and safety, and the effect on the landscape. ‘This is a magnificent and beautiful part of the country so the proposed new turbines - twice the size of the old ones - would have very seriously affected several villages and nearby Bolton Abbey which is classified as an ancient monument.’ Another campaigner, Catherine Leigh said: ‘It is fantastic news - we all know that for three quarters of the time they have been here the turbines have not been working.’ Craven District Council, the local planning authority, turned down a scheme for two bigger turbines to replace the demolished wind farm, after hearing listed buildings would be adversely affected by the ‘intrusive’ machines. And English Heritage warned they would refer the plans to central Government if they were passed. They even wrote to the landowner, the Duke of Devonshire, who owns the 30,000-acre Bolton Abbey estate and leases the reservoir to Yorkshire Water. The Duke, who also owns the Chatsworth estate, replied that he was happy to see the democratic process taking place. Council development control officer Ian Swain said: ‘The turbines were originally granted permission in the early 90’s and one of the conditions was that if they ceased to be operational, they would have to be removed.’ Yorkshire Water, owned by the US-based Kelda Group, said it had no plans to appeal the decision to refuse permission for the new turbines. A spokesman for RenewableUK, which represents the windfarm industry, said they were unaware of any large scale projects being taken down and not replaced.","Yorkshire Dales wind turbines to be removed after 20 years .

'The presentation of my case and my mitigation is my constitutional right,' Wall said. 'This is my case. This is my life. All the choices are mine alone to make.' Wall pleaded guilty on February 13 to murdering girlfriend Taft and pleaded no contest to killing the couple's infant son. After the baby's death, Wall was jailed for violating a domestic violence injunction Taft had filed against him, but neither a recent 14-year stay in prison nor his status as a suspect in his son's death was mentioned in court. Three days after he was released on $1,000 bail, Taft was stabbed to death in her apartment.

"You no longer need to be a spy like James Bond to get your hands on an amphibious car. David March has designed the world's fastest Jeep-style vehicle that can be driven straight from the land into the water and goes from a car to a boat in just 15 seconds. Called the Panther, the vehicle can reach water speeds of up to 45mph - almost as fast as an average speedboat - and is fitted with a custom-made 3.7 litre V6 engine, fibreglass hull and lightweight chromoly steel chassis. Scroll down for video . A Californian-based car company has designed the world's fastest amphibious car called the Panther, pictured. It is capable of reaching water speeds of up to 45mph - almost as fast as an average speedboat - plus can be driven up to 80mph on land . The Panther can be driven straight from the land into the water and goes from a car to a boat in just 15 seconds. The wheels are lifted into the chassis using hydraulics and the car switches to a boat using a 'jet drive' lever . Weight: 2950 lbs . Height: 69"" windshield up, 51"" windshield down, 44"" windshield down, wheels retracted . Length: 180"" Width: 72"" Water Speed: 44 mph . Land Speed: 80+ mph . Passengers: 4 . Engine: Honda 3.7 liter VTEC . Transmission: 4 speed manual . Marine Propulsion: Panther Jet . Brakes: Four wheel disc . Wheel Retraction: Hydraulic . Fuel: 91 Octane Pump Gas . Cooling System: Closed with marine heat exchanger . It is also capable of reaching speeds of 80mph on land. James Bond, played by Sir Roger Moore, famously drove an amphibious Lotus Esprit from the land into the sea during the 1976 film The Spy Who Loved Me. WaterCar partner Fred Selby, 66, from Newport Beach, California spent 11 years fine-turning the machine before he felt ready to put it on the market. The Panther's design is based on a Jeep CJ8 Scrambler, however, because the chassis of the Jeep was too heavy for the water, the Panther's lightweight chassis is made of chromoly steel. Once in the water, the Panther is remarkably stable for a boat that is only 15 ft (4.6 m) in length. 'We've been working for years and years to be able to get these to perform like a boat on the water and like a car on the street,' March told CBS. March has done his best to test out the vehicle and made his first trip to the Catalina Islands last Saturday. 'Going on the road for 15 miles and then being able to hit the water and go 30 miles across with nothing breaking and just cruising across … made it in an hour and 10 minutes on 10 gallons of gas,' said March. The Panther's chromoly steel chassis was designed to slip into a fibreglass hull. The hull is also filled with closed-cell styrofoam to help the car stay afloat. The engine for the Panther is the latest-generation Acura 3.7-liter VTEC V-6 engine, custom-fitted with aluminium parts, a overhead camshaft cylinder head and 24 valves .

The engine for the Panther is the latest-generation Acura 3.7-liter VTEC V-6 engine, custom-fitted with aluminium parts, a overhead camshaft cylinder head and 24 valves. Both intake and exhaust valves are controlled by Acura's Variable valve Timing and lift Electronic Control (VTEC) system. This engine produces 305 horsepower at 6,300 rpm and on land the Panther can reach speeds of around 80mph. The Panther weighs 2950lbs and is 15ft long. As a boat, the amphibious vehicle is powered by a Panther marine propulsion jet. It needs to be travelling at around 15mph to get enough momentum to enter the water . WaterCar's Panther car can carry up to four passengers in both land and water mode. The vehicle can be fitted with fishing rod holders, pictured. It can be sailed in both salt and fresh water and the chassis is protected from water damage . It needs to be travelling at around 15mph to enter the water and can then reach top speeds of almost 45mph. To drive the Panther in water, the driver must put the four-speed gear changer in neutral, pull a knob to switch the transfer case to 'jet drive', hydraulically lift the wheels and tyres out of the water, and start boating. This entire process takes less than 15 seconds. The Panther sells for anywhere in . between $100,000 and $200,000 and March told CBS that they've already . pre-sold cars to princes in Dubai and many Silicon Valley workers. The Rolling chassis is a kit and additional components can be bought off the shelf. The Turn-key minus version doesn't come with an engine. The Panther starts at £49,800 for a 'Rolling chassis', £70,000 for a 'Turn-key minus' version, and £89,000 for a complete Panther.

'The thrilling acceleration is provided by a Honda V6 V-Tec motor. 'You can leave the highway behind thanks to its long travel off road suspension and travel in the water courtesy of the panther jet.

"Britain was last night reported to be in talks with Germany over a secret deal to help their car industry in return for support for our banks. Representatives of David  Cameron and Chancellor Angela Merkel have been discussing a German plan to delay the introduction of caps on carbon dioxide emissions that could harm BMW, Mercedes-Benz and Audi. In return, the UK wants help to protect the banking sector, which is lobbying to reduce the impact of Brussels regulations. Friendly: Representatives of both Cameron and Chancellor Merkel have been discussing a plan to delay caps on carbon dioxide emissions which could harm car makers like Audi, BMW and Mercedes-Benz . Barclays Bank Headquarters, London, The UK stands to gain better protection for its banking sector . Officials have suggested measures including the disclosure of the tax that banks pay in every country, and changes to regulations proposed by the European Commission for the hedge fund industry. And Britain also wants German help to protect taxpayers from having to contribute to a fund to help ailing eurozone banks. Last night Lib Dem sources told The Times that the proposed deal also included a request for help with Britain’s attempt to overturn an EU cap on bank bonuses, which would limit them to 200 per cent of salary. A government source confirmed that it involved trading support for the banking sector in return for helping German car companies. However, the source denied that there was a specific link to bank bonuses as this issue was no longer in EU politicians’ hands. George Osborne wants to strike down plans for the cap on bonuses, which takes effect in the new year. Last month, Britain launched a challenge to the cap in the European Court of Justice, but a ruling could take two years. One Lib Dem MEP involved in the negotiations over the carbon dioxide cap suggested that, by seeking to support Germany, Britain could end up penalising its own car industry. Chris Davies, a member of the European Parliament’s negotiating team on the issue, said: ‘Giving priority to the interests of German luxury carmakers may help David Cameron benefit the bankers who can afford to buy them, but it doesn’t help British drivers or carmakers here.’","Germany wants to delay the introduction of caps on carbon dioxide emissions that could harm BMW, Mercedes-Benz and Audi .

"On the 20th anniversary of the brutal murders of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ron Goldman, the voices of two victims are conspicuously silent - those of Nicole's children. Justin and Sydney Simpson were just five and eight respectively when their mother was found brutally murdered alongside her friend at her Los Angeles home on June 12, 1994. Days later, their father OJ Simpson was charged with the murders then later acquitted following a televised, eight-month trial which gripped the nation. Their aunt Tanya Brown, Nicole's youngest sister, has spoken this week about the close bond she shares with her niece and nephew and how despite the tragedy they have endured, the pair have grown into happy, well-adjusted adults. Scroll down for video . OJ Simpson, pictured in 1995, with his son Justin and daughter Sydney, they year after their mother, Nicole Brown Simpson was brutally murdered . The aunt has said that Justin, now . 25, and Sydney, 28, are both in the restaurant business in the . Southeast. Ms Brown, 44, told RadarOnline: 'They’re in their late 20s. They’re professional. They’ve gone to college. They’re in relationships. They’re happy. They’re just like us. Quote unquote.' The aunt said that following their father's 1995 murder trial it was difficult for the children to experience a normal life. However Ms Brown and the children's grandmother forced themselves to face OJ, who they believe killed Nicole and Ron Goldman, for the sake of the children. Tanya Brown, the sister of Nicole Brown Simpson, revealed last month that her niece and nephew are well-adjusted and happy people . Ms Brown said: 'They will always love their dad. I choose to respect that.' OJ Simpson and Nicole Brown married in 1985 and . had two children Sydney and Justin. In 1989, the former football player . pleaded no contest to a domestic violence charge against Simpson. The couple . divorced in 1992. Tanya Brown also revealed that she has never discussed their mother's murder or OJ Simpson with her niece and nephew. 'They’ve probably talked about it on their own,' she said. 'But when they come to our house we have fun. We don’t need to rehash everything.' Ms Brown, a life coach and mental-health . advocate, recently wrote a memoir about the loss of her . older sister Nicole, entitled Finding Peace Amid The Chaos. In the emotional book, she revealed the moment she knew that the man she once called 'Uncle OJ' was responsible for her death. She also described how her family's lives were forever shattered on the morning of June 13, 1994, when they found out that Nicole, recently divorced from OJ Simpson, had been stabbed to death outside her Los Angeles home along with her friend Ronald Goldman. She said the grief-stricken family watched on TV as her sister's bloodied corpse was loaded into a van to be taken to the morgue.

"Cutting the green c**p: David Cameron, who once pledged to lead the 'greenest government ever', has publicly promised to 'roll back' green taxes, which add more than £110 a year to average fuel bills . David Cameron has ordered ministers to ditch the ‘green crap’ blamed for driving up energy bills and making business uncompetitive, it is claimed. The Prime Minister, who once pledged to lead the ‘greenest government ever’, has publicly promised to ‘roll back’ green taxes, which add more than £110 a year to average fuel bills. But a senior Tory source said Mr Cameron’s message in private is far blunter. The source said: ‘He’s telling everyone, “We’ve got to get rid of all this green crap.” He’s absolutely focused on it.’ Tory high command has also privately abandoned Mr Cameron’s pre-election mantra ‘vote blue, go green’. ‘It’s vote blue, get real, now – and woe betide anyone who doesn’t get the memo,’ the source said. The Prime Minister’s comments relate to his bid to cut fuel bills by removing green taxes, the source said. But they will horrify environmental campaigners. But a senior Downing Street source said: 'We do not recognise this phrase'. Meeting supporters of the HS2 high-speed rail project outside Number 10 this morning, Mr Cameron was asked by journalists whether he still believed in the environmental agenda. 'This is a part of it,' he replied. 'We have got the world's first green investment bank, we have got great support for our green technology industries. We have got the first nuclear power station since 1995. This is a government investing in important green technologies.' Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said today green levies are not 'all crap' and added that Mr Cameron agrees with him. 'The Prime Minister and I, funnily enough, were discussing it just yesterday so it so happens I don't think that's a fair reflection of his views,' he said. 'We both want to see policies, where we are control of them in government, made as cost-effective as possible without cutting our commitment to reducing carbon commitments and looking after the environment.' In opposition, Mr Cameron made great play of his green credentials as he tried to detoxify the Conservative Party’s image. Cuts? Mr Cameron wants to scrap green levies which subsidise wind farms . In 2006 he travelled in the Arctic Circle with a pack of huskies to highlight his concern about climate change. Huskies: In 2006 Mr Cameron travelled in the Arctic Circle with a pack of huskies to highlight his concern about climate change . He was repeatedly pictured cycling to the Commons – though this backfired when it emerged his shoes and papers followed in a car. And he even applied to put a wind turbine on the roof of his family home. But although he still pays lip service to the need to tackle climate change, his enthusiasm for green issues waned as the Government battled the economic crisis. In September, Chancellor George Osborne said Britain should not be ‘in front of the rest of the world’ on tackling climate change. And the Government has driven through radical planning reforms to boost the economy, which critics claim could lead to the concreting over of large parts of the Green Belt. The revelations come as the Prime Minister is locked in a dispute with the Lib Dems about his plan to cut the costly green levies on energy bills. Mr Cameron wants to scrap most of the charges, which help subsidise wind farms and pay for home insulation. But Nick Clegg is insisting they must stay. The Prime Minister is understood to be pushing for a delay in the rollout of the Energy Company Obligation scheme, which adds about £60 a year to average bills. The £1.3billion scheme, which pays for insulating the homes of the poor, has been criticised for waste and bureaucracy. It is due to be rolled out across the country by 2015 but could now be delayed until 2017. The Tories also want to see cuts to subsidies for wind turbines and solar panels. The Government’s green record came under attack from 41 environmental groups this week. Picture: Green taxes add more than £110 a year to the average annual household fuel bill, which has now hit £1,400 . The umbrella group Wildlife and Countryside Link said the Government was failing to deliver a third of its commitments to protect the natural environment. Dr Elaine King, the group’s director, said: ‘David Cameron promised the greenest government ever. Using the Government’s own promises as a yardstick, these findings show he’s failed to stick to his plan.’ - Prime Minister David Cameron . Downing Street said today the Prime Minister had not abandoned his commitment to the environment. 'He has been quite clear about rolling back the impact of levies on energy bills, but only last week in Sri Lanka he was talking about the importance of tackling climate change,' said the Number 10 source. Mr Cameron made clear during that Sri Lanka visit that he believed the evidence of global warming was 'growing' and thought it was right to take 'preventative and mitigating steps' in response. Responding to speculation that man-made climate change may be to blame for the devastating typhoon in the Philippines, the PM said then: 'I'll leave the scientists to speak for themselves about the link between severe weather events and climate change. 'But the evidence seems to me to be growing. As a practical politician, I think the sensible thing is to say let's take preventative and mitigating steps given the chances this might be the case.'","The Prime Minister has publicly promised to 'roll back' green taxes .

"National Lottery managers have come under fire for earmarking £5m for executives' bonuses - as it prepares to double the price of the tickets. Bosses at Camelot's parent company Premier Lotteries Investments UK have set aside a total £11.3m of pay for 'key management' over eight years, including £5m for bonuses, as long as they reach 'challenging targets'. Details of the company's accounts caused new controversy for the firm already under fire for announcing plans to raise the ticket price this autumn. Fingers crossed: Bonuses for top staff including chief executive DianneThompson are dependent upon 'challenging targets' Many threatened to boycott the National Lottery when the price rises from £1 to £2 this September, saying it was a 'tax on the poor'. Today, critics expressed anger at the plan to boost the top management's pay after hiking the price of lottery tickets. Marc Gander, of the Consumer Action Group, told the Daily Express: 'If you were wondering where your money is going, now you know. 'I suppose one of the benefits of being a Lottery boss is you can look forward to a huge win without even having to buy a ticket.' And Ukip deputy leader Paul Nuttall said: 'Lottery players are being fleeced...with these bonus increases we can see why.' A Camelot spokesman said the money was for 25 'key managers' and was 'not a payment but a provision' that would only be paid if challenging targets were met. Price to double: Tickets for the National Lottery will rise to £2 in September but Camelot say prizes will rise, too . She added: 'There is a bonus scheme available to all staff in companies across the Group. 'Attracting and retaining the highest . calibre of staff at all levels has been a key factor in Camelot's . continuing success as one of the world’s leading lottery groups.' Last year the company paid out £6.5m to bosses, including bonuses of £900,000.  Camelot chief executive Dianne Thompson earns around £1million a year, not including her bonus. When they announced plans to double the price of a ticket, Camelot said it would mean bigger prizes for winners. But there was widespread anger at the news, and one snap poll found that as many as eight out of ten could give up buying Lottery tickets. MPs and campaigners said the increase was a ‘tax on the poor’ and ‘sheer greed’ and research revealed pensioners and those on low incomes would be hit hardest. Douglas Carswell, Tory MP for Clacton in Essex, said: ‘With the price of everything going up, and given the profits they make, it would be nice if the people who run the National Lottery didn’t put up the price of a ticket. 'It’s not as if they are short of a few bob.’ The Lottery's official Twitter account  @TNLUK was bombarded with complaints as customers said the new ticket price was a 'rip-off' designed to 'fund the company directors' lavish lifestyles'. Lottery backlash: People vented their outrage on Twitter after Camelot said the ticket price was to double . Customers called the increase a ‘rip-off’ and complained that organiser Camelot was forcing customers to ‘fund the company directors’ lavish lifestyles’ by doubling prices. But it emerged yesterday that the lottery operator planned to cut the amount from each ticket sold that it gives to good causes, to fund the bigger prizes. The company, which has run the National Lottery since it began in 1994, raised £6.5 billion in ticket sales last year. Lotto is the main game in the National Lottery but its sales have been falling for a number of years. Camelot believes that without its proposed changes, which have been cleared by the regulator, the National Lottery Commission, that decline will continue.","More than £11m has been set aside for key management pay at Camelot .

"A young woman today described how she grabbed the blade of a 12-inch kitchen knife and wrestled it away from a crazed woman trying to stab her in an unprovoked attack. Kerry Clark, 24, told a court that she grabbed the blade with one hand and kicked Nicola Edgington, 32, off her at a bus stop in Bexleyheath, south-east London, in October 2011. Edgington, who had been released from a secure mental unit after killing her mother Marion, had pinned Miss Clark to the ground and was pointing the knife at her chest, the Old Bailey heard. Defendant: Diagnosed schizophrenic Nicola Edgington, 32, left, is accused of stabbing Sally Hodkin, 58, to death with a 12-inch meat cleaver in Bexleyheath in October 2011 and the attempted murder of Kerry Clark, 24, right . The young woman had been listening to . her iPod and rolling a cigarette when Edgington lunged at her, . screaming: ‘You f**king b***h, you f**king b***h’, before Miss Clark managed to . disarm her. Stabbed: Sally Hodkin suffered a fatal cut to the neck when she was attacked on her way to work . She told the Old Bailey: ‘We were . grappling. I managed to grab the blade with one hand and kick her off . me. It happened very quickly.’ Miss Clark then said to her: ‘You . crazy b***h, what are you doing?’ Edgington, who was now 3ft away then . allegedly retorted: ‘I am not the crazy one. You are the one with the . knife in your hand’. She added that Edgington ‘appeared . quite angry’ as she demanded ‘give me my f*****g knife back’, but Miss . Clark refused. Then looking ‘bewildered’, Edgington walked off and . crossed the road. As Edgington went into a shop, Miss . Clark dropped the knife as other passengers and estate agents came to . her aid. She suffered cuts to the heel of her palm and three middle . fingers during the attack. Miss Clark recalled: ‘I noticed a big . girl come towards me. When I noticed the figure was coming towards me I . quite quickly looked up. I saw the woman lunge at me with a knife. Danger to the public: Edgington turned up at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital demanding to be admitted before she hurt someone - but walked out and went on a rampage, the court heard . ‘I suppose it was straight on as I . turned to face her. She just had the knife in her hand and angling it . towards my neck and chest.  She was screaming: “You f**king b***h, you . f**king b***h”. Manslaughter: Nicola Edgington stabbed her mother Marion, pictured, to death in 2005 . ‘My instant reaction was to put my . hands up to protect myself from the knife. I just went straight up and . tried to cup the blade with my both hands. I held the blade with my . right hand. ‘But I felt her push me with the knife . so I went back to try and avoid it. I fell to the floor and she was on . top of me. It was quite a force, I had to fight a lot. I was looking . directly at the knife. ‘I had a vague recollection of her of . her face. It was aggressive. It’s hard to recall to be honest but she . was on top of me with the knife still at my chest. I still had my hands . around the blade of the knife. ‘I was trying to get her off me or get . the knife off of her. This happened quite quickly but I think I managed . to grab the blade with one hand and kick her off me while she was on . top of me.’ Earlier the court heard police were . warned the former psychiatric patient was a danger to the public just . hours before she launched the knife rampage which left Miss Clark . injured and minutes later Sally Hodkin, 58, dead. Psychiatrist Dr Akintayo Idowu dialled . 999 and told police to ‘forcibly detain’ Edgington and bring her back . to hospital after she allegedly walked off as she was being admitted to a . secure mental ward. Attack: Meat Market in Bexleyheath where Edgington is alleged to have taken the knife . Killed: The house in East Sussex where Marion Edgington's body was found in 2005 . Dr Akintayo Idowu was processing the paperwork when she simply walked away around 6.30am, the court was told. Hours later after catching several . buses she bought a large kitchen knife from supermarket Asda and . allegedly used it to stab commuter Miss Clark. Having being disarmed, Edgington, of Greenwich, south-east London, allegedly  then grabbed a knife from a butcher’s shop and hacked grandmother Mrs Hodkin to death. Edgington denies murder and attempted murder. She had spent three years in a secure . hospital after pleading guilty to the 2005 manslaughter of her mother . but was released into community care in 2009. The trial was adjourned to . Friday.

"After weeks of audition news, Sasheer Zamata has beat out a dozen other black comediennes to land a coveted spot on Saturday Night Live. SNL creator Lorne Michaels decided to break tradition and hire a new cast member mid-season after facing criticism that his show lacked diversity for going six straight seasons without a woman of color. A spokesman at NBC confirmed Zamata's hire on Monday. A stand-up comic, Zamata is also an alumna of Upright Citizens Brigade Theatre, the improv comedy troupe founded by former-SNL star Amy Poehler.  She currently acts in the online web series 'Pursuit of Sexiness'. Zamata will make her debut during the January 18 episode, which will be hosted by Drake. Scroll down for video . Hired: It was announced on Monday that Sasheer Zamata will be the newest addition to Saturday Night Live, filling a black female cast member void created when Maya Rudolph left the show in 2007 . Live from New York: Zamata will make her debut on Saturday Night Live during the January 18 episode hosted by Drake . She beat out NBC Universal Diversity Scholarship winner Natasha Rothwell and sketch-comic Kerry Coddett in the final round of auditions. Zamata's competitor Coddett was one of the many critics of the show's lack of diversity, going to far as to write a scathing essay on the Huffington Post responding to a comment from black cast member Kenan Thompson who said the show often auditions black females but finds they're never 'ready'. Coddett pointed to the show hosted by Kerry Washington in November, saying perhaps it was the white male dominated SNL writing room that wasn't ready to handle black female characters. 'The SNL writers showed what they could do with a ""ready"" black actress: pigeonhole her. They took an Emmy-nominated actress and made her play a nagging girlfriend; a sassy eye-rolling assistant; and a rage-filled Ugandan beauty queen,' Coddett wrote. 'Why can't they create interesting and funny characters outside race? How long will it take the SNL writers to learn that black is not a punch line?' Rumors that a new player might be added . to the cast started last month, when Gothamist reported that auditions . were held earlier at the Groundlings theater for black . female comediennes in LA. The rumor was confirmed by SNL's creator and producer Lorne Michaels who told the New York Times that a black female cast member will join the cast in January - the first time Michaels can remember adding a cast member mid-season. Man behind the curtain: Lorne Michaels started auditioning black comediennes last month . 'All told we've seen about 25 people,' Michaels told the Times. 'A lot of people we saw are really good. Hopefully we'll come out of the process well.' Michaels . also revealed that he had vetted two black female players when he was . initially hiring for the current season this past fall. He . saw the two women during a performance in Chicago, but their . performances weren't as strong when they were invited to New York for . the final auditions. 'Then when the deck got reshuffled and as we premiered we realized, it looks a different way,' he said. That's when he started the unusual process of searching for a new cast member mid-season. Michaels . says he can't remember ever adding a new cast member in the middle of . the season, but says he has added players in March or April to get them . into the last episodes of the season. While many have criticized the show . for not having anyone to play prominent black females like first lady . Michelle Obama, Beyonce or Oprah, Michaels says that has nothing to do . with his hiring decision. 'That's a weird sort of way of looking at it because you don't judge comedy that way. Versatility is what we look for.' This will be the first time since 2007 that SNL has had a woman of African-American heritage on the show. Four black women: In its nearly 40 years on the air, Saturday Night live . has hired just four black women. The first was Yvonne Hudson, right, and Danitra Vance, left, spent the . 1985-86 season on the show . No more: After Ellen Cleghorn, left, left the cast in 1995, there wouldn't be another black woman until Maya Rudolph in 2000. Rudolph left in 2007 and there hasn't been a black woman on the show since . The two current black cast members- Kenan Thompson and Jay Pharoah- were the ones to spurn the criticism this fall as they felt it was inappropriate that all impersonations of prominent black women meant that they would have to dress in drag. As a result, there have been no . sketches on the weekly program featuring black females this season, excepting the episode which was hosted by Kerry Washington. 'SNL' has had just four black women in its regular troupe since premiering in 1975, including Maya Rudolph who is biracial. Done: Cast member Kenan Thompson announced this season that he will no longer dress in drag to play black women. He had played the likes of Whoopi Goldberg (right), Raven Symone and Aretha Franklin in the past . 'It's not like it's not a priority for us,' Michaels said in an interview with The Associated Press in early November. 'It will happen. I'm sure it will happen.' News of the invitation-only auditions that have been taking place in Los Angeles and Chicago broke when pictures of the prospective candidates backstage hit the internet. Actress Bresha Webb said she was 'honored' to be one of the 11 black comediennes asked to audition on about two days notice in that instance. 'It was an awesome opportunity even though it was such short notice but, if you stay ready you ain't gotta get ready and we were READY!,' she told TheJasmineBrand.com. 'I can share that we all entered the Groundlings theater backstage having no idea what to expect. I had no clue who was apart of the showcase. Of course my comedienne friends (Tiffany Haddish, Beth Payne and Gabrielle Dennis) were there. And some talented ladies in sketch comedy were there that I had never met,' she said. It's happening: SNL's creator Lorne Michaels confirmed that a new black female comedienne will be added to the cast this January following reports that a 'secret' audition were held earlier this month in LA (those asked to audition pictured) Simone Shepherd, Lekendra Tookes, Azie Dungey, Amber Ruffin, Damirra Brunson, Nicole Byer and Mistry Monroe also auditioned according to Jezebel. 'We were all very supportive of each other and there was no sense of competition or pettiness,' Ms Webb said. 'We were just happy that some new black women in comedy were being considered and given a shot. We even held hands prayed after the showcase. It was refreshing. The show was also sold out. It was packed to the max.' The timing of the announcement comes not only as a result of the criticism but also due to the high-profile departure of cast member and head Seth Meyers, who will leave in the New Year to host Late Night when Jimmy Fallon goes to The Tonight Show.","The stand-up comic's hire was confirmed by a spokesman at NBC today .

"A New Jersey nuclear plant is on alert as flood waters from Hurricane Sandy threatens the cooling of its spent uranium fuel rods. Exelon said that a further rise in water levels could force operators at its New Jersey Oyster Creek nuclear power plant to use emergency water supplies from a fire hose to cool the spent rods. The alert - the second lowest of four Nuclear Regulatory Commission action levels - came after water levels at the plant rose by more than 6.5 feet, potentially affecting the pumps that circulate water through the plant from Barnegat Bay, an NRC spokesman said. Concern: Floodwaters could submerge the pump that is used to cool the water in the spent uranium pool at Oyster Creek (pictured) Those pumps are not essential since the plant is shut for planned refueling at the moment. However a further rise to 7 feet could submerge the service water pump motor that is used to cool the water in the spent fuel pool. If cooling ceased, the pool would take 25 hours to reach boiling point. The spokesman said the company could use water from a fire hose to cool the pool if necessary. The used uranium rods in the pool could cause the water to boil without additional coolant: in an extreme scenario the rods could overheat, risking the eventual release of radiation. The NRC said in a statement that it expected water levels would begin to abate within the next several hours. Sandy made landfall last night as the most powerful Atlantic storm to hit the United States, bringing a storm surge of more than 13 feet. There have been about a dozen instances of alert-level nuclear incidents in the past four years, according to NRC press releases. An alert-level incident means there is a 'potential substantial degradation in the level of safety' at a reactor. Nuclear fears: The Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant in northeastern Japan last year. Helicopters and hoses were used to keep the uranium fuel rods cool . The concerns over the status of the spent fuel pool at Oyster Creek were reminiscent of the fears that followed the Fukushima disaster in Japan last year, when helicopters and fire hoses were enlisted to ensure the pools remained filled with fresh, cool water. The nuclear industry has said that the spent fuel rods at Fukushima were never exposed to the air. Oyster Creek is a single unit boiling water reactor that began operation in 1969. It was the first large scale commercial nuclear power plant in the US and is scheduled to be retired at the end of 2019.","Rising water could knock out cooling system at New Jersey nuclear power plant .

"A woman has been sentenced to two-and-a-half to three years in prison after admitting to stealing almost $500,000 from a charity established to help victims of the Boston Marathon bombing.

A sketch of the man is pictured . A terrorist believed to have been involved in a horrific suicide bomb attack in Bulgaria last week has emerged as one of the biggest security threats to the Olympics. The man is thought to be carrying a U.S. passport under the name of David Jefferson and fled following the attack which killed six people last Wednesday in the resort of Burgas. He has emerged as a top target for Israeli security agents who fear their athletes will be attacked by an Iranian terror squad operating in Europe. The terrorist, who is suspected of helping the suicide bomber, is thought to have another powerful bomb similar to the one which destroyed the Israeli tourist bus. Following the Israeli concerns, security has been stepped up around its athletes taking part in the Games. MI5 and Scotland Yard are thought to have raised their threat assessment against the Israeli delegation as Britain prepares for the largest peacetime security operation ahead of the opening of the Olympics this Friday.

"Many hotels, especially the most luxurious, now come with free Wi-Fi as standard, but many of us assume that when we connect to these networks, our data is secure. Security experts have uncovered a threat that specifically targets such networks to steal information and even delete confidential data from visitors. The so-called Darkhotel campaign is believed to have been active for the past four years and works with ‘surgical precision’ to target even the most secure, and private, networks. Scroll down for video . Darkhotel was uncovered by experts from Kaspersky Lab’s Global Research and Analysis team. The cybercriminals begin by infiltrating hotel web networks, through a variety of methods. They typically target the networks in luxury hotels, and can handpick their victims . Darkhotel was uncovered by experts from Kaspersky Lab’s Global Research and Analysis team. The cybercriminals begin by infiltrating hotel web networks, through a variety of methods. They typically target the networks in luxury hotels, and can handpick their victims. Once it has access to a network, the Darkhotel attackers select a high-powered victim and wait until they connect to the Wi-Fi network, ultimately entering their room number and surname at the login. When travelling, any network, even semi-private ones in hotels, should be viewed as potentially dangerous, said Kaspersky. To prevent this, the experts warn that travellers should avoid updating software or clicking files when not on trusted networks. They should also keep their antivirus software up-to-date, before they leave their home. The attackers then trick the person into downloading and installing a so-called backdoor file, which pretends to be an update for legitimate software, such as the Google Toolbar, Adobe Flash or Windows Messenger. The unsuspecting victim downloads this hotel ‘welcome package’, only to infect his machine with Darkhotel’s spying software. Once on a system, the backdoor has been, and may be used, to further download more advanced stealing tools such as an advanced keylogger or the Trojan ‘Karba’. These tools collect data about the system and the anti-malware software installed on it, steals all keystrokes, and hunts for cached passwords in Firefox, Chrome and Internet Explorer. It also looks for Gmail Notifier, Twitter, Facebook, Yahoo, and Google login credentials, as well as other private information. The attacks are particularly targetted at successful businessmen and women. Attackers are able to acquire sensitive and confidential information, such as intellectual property of businesses that the people represent. Once the criminals have access to a network, the Darkhotel campaign selects a  victim and waits until they connect to the Wi-Fi network. They then trick the victim into downloading and installing a malicious file, pretending to be update for legitimate software, such as the Google Toolbar or Adobe Flash . After the operation, the attackers delete their tools from the hotel network and go back into hiding, explained Kurt Baumgartner, principal security researcher at Kaspersky Lab. ‘For the past few years, Darkhotel has performed a number of successful attacks against high-profile individuals, employing methods and techniques that go well beyond typical cybercriminal behaviour. David Riches, technical Director at Airangel, which provides WiFi to hotels including The Ritz London, Malmaison, Radisson BLU and Holiday Inn told MailOnline: 'This story is yet another example of scare-mongery around personal cyber security, that could actually do more harm good. 'Our platform contains customers' guest data within HTTPS secured pages so it cannot be intercepted as it is fully encrypted point to point. 'Added to this guests can install a mobile Internet Security app that allows them set their own privacy levels and have complete peace of mind that their personal data is safe wherever and whenever they access the web.' ‘This threat actor has operational competence, mathematical and crypto-analytical offensive capabilities, and other resources that are sufficient to abuse trusted commercial networks and target specific victim categories with strategic precision.’ The most recent travelling targets include top executives from the US and Asia including chief executives, senior vice presidents, sales and marketing directors. Kaspersky did not reveal the names of those affected, however, or the specific hotels. ‘The mix of both targeted and indiscriminate attacks is becoming more and more common, where targeted attacks are used to compromise high-profile victims, and botnet-style operations are used for mass surveillance,’ added Mr Baumgartner.

"Cilla Black has backed her friend Sir Cliff Richard as he prepares to be questioned by police over a historic allegation of sexual assault. The singer and former Blind Date presenter came out in support of Sir Cliff after police raided his £3million apartment in Sunningdale, Berkshire last week. Sir Cliff is currently on holiday in the Algarve, but is preparing to return home to the UK where he is expected to be questioned by officers over an accusation that he sexually assaulted a boy under 16 at a Christian rally in Sheffield in 1985. Cilla Black, pictured with Sir Cliff Richard at Wimbledon this year, has come out in defence of her friend, insisting she is 'absolutely positive' he is innocent of claimed sexual abuse . The two popstars, pictured in 1972, have been close friends since they recorded a song together in 1969 . In a strongly worded statement released today, Cilla Black said she is 'absolutely positive' he is innocent. She said: 'Cliff is a very close friend of mine and has been for a million years. 'I, like everyone else, was shocked to hear of these allegations and I am absolutely positive that they are without foundation.' The pair have been close friends since they recorded a song together in 1969 and are regularly spotted enjoying the tennis at Wimbledon. Miss Black's defence of her friend came after Sir Cliff held a five-hour meeting with his lawyers in Portugal ahead of his planned return to Britain to face police questioning over an allegation of sexual assault. The 73-year-old is currently on holiday in the Algarve and has hired Max Clifford’s lawyer, Ian Burton, of law firm BCL Burton Copeland, to represent him as he vows to clear his name. It was announced today that the singer has pulled out of a planned appearance at a charity event at Canterbury Cathedral after finding himself at the centre of the police probe. His spokesman said he would not be attending the event, planned for September 26, as he 'doesn’t want the event to be overshadowed by the false allegation and has therefore withdrawn'. The statement adds: 'He is sorry for any disappointment or inconvenience caused.' Sir Cliff is yet to hear from detectives, even though police have stated publicly for five days that they want to speak to him. He . reacted with fury last Thursday after learning that police were . searching his Berkshire home as a BBC filmed live, when he had no prior . notice. Sir Cliff Richard has been speaking to lawyers in Portugal after British police said they want to speak to him over accusations that he sexually assaulted a boy under 16 at a Christian rally in Sheffield in 1985 . Top lawyer Ian Burton, who represented publicist Max Clifford, flew into Portugal yesterday ahead of a five-hour meeting with Sir Cliff . Police have come under fire for the way in which they raided Sir Cliff's home in Sunningdale, Berkshire . Mr Burton has represented a string of high profile clients, including late singer Amy Winehouse, former Harrods owner Mohamed al Fayed and jockey Kieren Fallon. He was hired by Clifford after the publicist was accused of a series of sexual assaults. Clifford was jailed for eight years earlier this year. Sir Cliff's meeting with lawyers came as it emerged the BBC and the police chief in charge of the Sir Cliff Richard investigation are to be hauled before MPs over their treatment of the star. South Yorkshire chief constable David Crompton and BBC director general Lord Hall face a grilling over the decision to screen live television images of the singer’s £3million home being raided. Keith Vaz, chairman of the Home Affairs Select Committee, has written to both demanding to know how the BBC found out about the search by detectives investigating a historical allegation of sexual abuse on a boy under 16 and whether police were bounced into acting under BBC pressure. South Yorkshire police and crime commissioner Shaun Wright has announced an independent review after calling Mr Crompton to a meeting yesterday. Sir Cliff was staying at his home in the Algarve (pictured) when police raided his flat in Berkshire last week . Inquiry: David Crompton (left), chief constable of South Yorkshire Police, and BBC director general Lord  Hall will face a grilling by MPs over the leak row surrounding the search of Sir Cliff Richard's home . The BBC has received 477 complaints about its coverage of the raid amid an avalanche of criticism from celebrities, politicians and leading lawyers, who have dubbed it a ‘witch-hunt’ and accused the BBC of blackmailing police into going public. More than 200 viewers were concerned over how the BBC found out about the search and was present while it was carried out, and 73 complained that its reporting suggested Sir Cliff was guilty. The BBC also received 197 complaints that there has been too much coverage of the allegations against the singer. Former BBC journalist Sir Michael Parkinson, 79, has described it as a ‘witch-hunt’, attacking the BBC for an ‘error of judgment’. Tory MP Andrew Bridgen said: ‘What the BBC has done amounts to blackmail. This is shocking behaviour by a publicly funded national broadcaster.’ Mr Crompton and Lord Hall have been warned they are likely to be summoned before the Home Affairs Committee when Parliament returns from recess in September. Search: People, thought to be police officers involved in the search, inside the property on Thursday . Controversial: A BBC news crew provides news of the raid on Sir Cliff Richard's Berkshire apartment . Mr Vaz has sent a list of questions he wants answered by midday on Friday. He wants the BBC to reveal how and when it found out about the highly sensitive police inquiry, and whether the information came from a police source. South Yorkshire Police has already admitted striking a deal where the BBC was given exclusive information in advance and allowed to film the raid. The force said it had been ‘reluctant’ to co-operate but believed if it did not, the BBC would run the story anyway. Former Policing Minister Nick Herbert said both the police and the BBC had 'serious questions' to answer . The police may have acted corruptly if they let the BBC know they were going to raid Sir Cliff Richard's home, a former policing minister has said. Nick Herbert said that South Yorkshire police and the BBC needed to explain how the raid on Sir Cliff's home in Berkshire was able to be filmed live on TV. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ‘I think there are serious questions to answer both on the part of the police about how this information got into the public domain, but also by the BBC for its editorial judgment in the way it then interacted with the police and decided that it was appropriate for instance to send a helicopter and film these events.’ He added: ‘If South Yorkshire Police say that it was not them that tipped off the BBC, something the BBC has confirmed, then I accept that. ‘But somebody tipped off the BBC and it's difficult to believe that that wasn't somebody who was in some way connected with these investigations. So it might have been another force. ‘If that person provided information to the BBC for payment, then that is corruption. If they did it simply because they wished to ingratiate themselves with the BBC then that is quite clearly ethically wrong and contrary to the new College of Policing code of ethics.’ It has written an official letter of complaint to Lord Hall, accusing the Corporation of breaking its guidelines. But Mr Crompton is under pressure to reveal when his force confirmed the timing of the raid and whether the plans changed. Former . Attorney General Dominic Grieve suggested that the force’s ‘very . questionable’ handling of the case may have contravened national . policing guidelines which say suspects should not be named before being . charged unless it has a ‘policing purpose’ such as protecting the public . or preventing crime. Lord . Macdonald of River Glaven, the former Director of Public Prosecutions, . described the police decision to liaise with the BBC as 'inexcusable'. He . told the Times: 'To use the search of premises in a serious and very . sensitive investigation of a high-profile figure as an excuse to set up a . major press event, I think it's unforgivable.' Sir Cliff Richard, with his friend John McElynn, has not been asked for an interview by South Yorkshire Police nor even been contacted by them . Crusade: Sir Cliff Richard and Billy Graham at an evangelical rally in Birmingham in 1984 . Former shadow home secretary David Davis said: ‘The extraordinary decision by the leadership of South Yorkshire Police to allow the searching of Sir Cliff Richard’s house to be televised, like some morally-challenged reality TV show, demonstrates there is something sick at the heart of Britain’s police and justice system.’ Human rights barrister Geoffrey Robertson accused officers of ‘treating Cliff Richard as though he were a bank robber or a mass murderer’. Last night the BBC said it would respond to South Yorkshire Police’s letter ‘in due course’. A spokesman added: ‘Mr Vaz understands and supports the right of the media to report matters in the public interest. The BBC's editorial independence is protected by our Royal Charter and is highly valued by the public. 'The BBC does not name its sources nor is it appropriate to go into detail around editorial processes.'","Former TV presenter says she is shocked by allegations leveled at Sir Cliff .

"New Charity Commission chairman William Shawcross yesterday signalled a break with his controversial predecessor, ‘quango queen’ Dame Suzi Leather, who was criticised for using the organisation for political purposes. Dame Suzi, who angered Conservatives by mounting attacks on the Government, repeatedly threatened independent schools with the loss of their charitable status, thereby pushing up fees and potentially forcing their closure. In contrast, Mr Shawcross, the biographer of the Queen Mother, said one of the roles of charities should be to help poor children to attend the ‘finest schools’. Bumpy handover: William Shawcross (right) has made his views on the 'politicisation of charities' clear. This is said to be a departure from former boss Dame Suzi Leather . He told the annual conference of the Women’s Institute in Cardiff: ‘I am sure that we here all agree that the nobility lies in the search to provide everyone with equality of opportunity.’ Mr Shawcross – who noted that the 160,000 British charities had an astonishing total income of £54 billion – added that his quango had a role to play in the fight against terrorism and the hijacking of charities by extremist outfits. He said: ‘We in the commission know that evil often tries to subvert the innate generosity of the charitable impulse for terrorist purposes. ‘The whole country has been appalled . by the acts of terror we have witnessed in recent years. We shall . redouble our efforts against terrorist subversion of charities.’ Mr Shawcross, 67, also promised to tackle ‘the politicisation of charities’. Disagreements: Dame Leather threatened independent schools with the loss of their charitable status, which Michael Gove campaigner for . He said: ‘Any charity is free to campaign to further its basic aims. But no charity can be exclusively campaigning. We have to draw a line.’ In his speech, Mr Shawcross lauded the Women’s Institute’s contribution to the UK and how it ‘always got things done’. The 4,000 members at the conference in Cardiff backed a resolution calling for action to  re-ignite Britain’s dwindling high streets. Spokeswoman Marylyn Haines-Evans said: ‘I believe high streets have a viable and very real future. ‘It’s not about turning back the tide, it’s about supporting those that are fit  for purpose in the 21st Century.’",Dame Suzi Leather clashed with Government over independent schools .
"Things turned ugly during a closely fought high school basketball game in Texas when members of the crowd unveiled provocative signs proclaiming 'White Power.' Fans of home team Flower Mound flashed the offensive signs during their heated triple-overtime victory over rivals Plano East on Friday. 'We thought it was racist,' said a Plano East student athlete who was at the game and asked not to be identified. '(The sign) said 'white power,' and we were shocked.' Fans of home team Flower Mound flashed the offensive 'White Power' signs during their heated triple-overtime victory over rivals Plano East on Friday night . Witnesses said the incident happened late in the game when both student sections were hyped up as the scoring lead switched several times. But the Plano East athlete remembers a specific moment when it got very raucous in the gym. 'Our student section started pointing at the sign,' the player told WFAA8. 'That's when it clicked into everyone's mind… 'Whoa... what are these guys doing?' And the teachers came and took the signs down.' The student said the signs were held up for 30 seconds before teachers rushed to remove them. However the provocative gesture was photographed and shared on social media by angry players and fans. Flower Mound's coach Eric Littleton responded on Twitter to the image of the sign saying it was 'unacceptable' 'This is ridiculous,' tweeted one Plano player. 'I thought we passed the racial stage of society.' Witnesses claim racial slurs were also directed at players during the game, especially after a player had been injured. Angry Plano students also told a local TV station that someone urinated and defecated on their team's bus, although neither team has confirmed it. Flower Mound's coach, Eric Littleton, responded on Twitter to the  sign describing it as  'unacceptable.' 'As head coach at FMHS I offer our full voice apology. I will pursue this fully. No place for this,' he tweeted. The Lewisville Independent School District, which oversees Flower Mound, has promised a full investigation. 'I want to be clear that this type of incident — however it has been perceived — has not and will not be tolerated in LISD,' Interim Superintendent Kevin Rogers said in a statement. 'We have always had high expectations for our more than 53,000 students and hold them to those standards both in and outside of the classroom.'","Fans of home team Flower Mound flashed the offensive signs during their heated triple-overtime victory over rivals Plano East on Friday night .

"An international drug trafficking ring forced dogs to swallow bags of cocaine and then brutally sliced the animals open to retrieve them. Police said they arrested 75 people . across northern Italy and Rome for using the dogs in a drug scam - at least 50 were died after being cut open.

"Apple's iPhone 5 received the biggest customer backlash following its launch in 2012, according to new research. One in five posts on social networks were critical of Apple's most recent handset, with the majority of people complaining about the introduction of a new power socket, the inaccuracy of Apple Maps and how similar the phone was to previous models. Samsung's Galaxy S4 received the least complaints - just 11 per cent - according to figures from analysts We Are Social. Apple's iPhone 5, pictured, was the most criticised handset on social networks after its launch in 2012, according to research by analysts We Are Social. One in five people complained about the device's power socket and lack of innovation . Number of launch day conversations . iPhone 5 – 1.7 million . BlackBerry Z10 – 300,000 . Galaxy S4 – 140,000 .

Features: discussions about any new and different features of the handset . Galaxy S4 – 56% . Lumia 920 – 37% . iPhone 5 – 29% . BlackBerry Z10 – 27% . We Are Social scanned Twitter, blogs and forums following the launch of four major handsets - Apple's iPhone 5 in September 2012, Samsung Galaxy S4 in March this year, the BlackBerry Z10 launch event in January and Nokia's launch of the Lumia 920, first announced in September 2012. The iPhone 5 came in for a barrage of complaints for everything from its lack of innovation to its new power connector socket and its mapping application. Apple added a Lightning to 30-pin power socket to the iPhone 5, which meant previous Apple users couldn't use their older chargers to charge the new device. Apple then charged extra for an adapter. Previous iPhones used a Google mapping application but this was replaced with Apple Maps in the iPhone 5. This led to complaints about misplacement of landmarks, poor satellite images and wrong directions. Less than a fortnight after the launch, Apple issued a statement apologising for the frustration Apple Maps had caused customers and recommended they try alternative mapping apps. There were also complaints about picture quality of photos taken on select iPhone 5s, with some customers saying there was a purple discolouration on images. Other iPhone 5 owners were left angry when the coating on their handset chipped off, exposing bright aluminium underneath. Samsung's Galaxy S4, pictured, was the least complained about handset on social networks after it launched in March this year. Figures from We Are Social claim that only 11 per cent of posts about the S4 contained negative comments . More than 300,000 conversations about the BlackBerry Z10, pictured, took place following its launch in January. This was more than the Samsung Galaxy S4 and the Nokia 920 . This became known as 'scuffgate' when Apple refused to acknowledge the problem. Other iPhone 5 users reported that white handsets leaked light behind the screen. Ed Kitchingman, senior analyst at We Are Social, said: 'Brands were often on the receiving end of criticism for their handsets offering nothing new to the previous model. 'The most successful launches were those that captured the consumer's imagination by talking about the handset's new and innovative features. 'And while leaks can be an important tool in building success, give away too much and the handset loses its 'wow' factor upon launch.' He said Samsung had the most 'wow factor' with 56 per cent of discussions being about new or different features with a particular emphasis on its eye tracking. In contrast, only 29 per cent of conversations about the iPhone 5 launch were focused on different features as dissent grows about the lack of innovation at Apple. However, the iPhone 5 was by far the most talked-about launch on social media, with around 1.7 million conversations, compared to 300,000 mentions of the Z10, 140,000 references to the Galaxy S4 and 45,000 comments about the Lumia 920. Nokia launched its Lumia 920, pictured, in September 2012. According to We Are Social there were only 45,000 social network conversations about the device after launch. However, the brand came second in a customer satisfaction survey by JD Power in March, beating Samsung . Apple's iPhone topped the J.D Power and Associates list of best smartphones for the ninth consecutive time in March. J.D. Power's scores are based on . customer experiences with certain products. In the most recent report, customers . said that their phone's performance was the most important feature, . followed by its design and features. How easy the phone was to use also played a part. The Californian-based firm took the top spot with a score of 855 out of 1,000. Second place went to Nokia with 795. Samsung came in a third at 793, followed by Motorola and HTC with 792 and 790, respectively. The average score was 796, while BlackBerry only scored 732. The research claims Apple still has . the strongest brand loyalty, though, due to 42 per cent of conversations . about the iPhone 5 launch based around the Apple brand itself. Men . dominate smartphone launch day conversations with 83 per cent of all . mentions coming from men and just 17 per cent generated by women. On a non-launch day, however, anywhere between 28 per cent and 41 per cent of conversations about mobile phones come from women. Apple's next iPhone could be announced on 10 September and go on sale ten days later, according to recent reports. The phone - dubbed iPhone 5S - is rumoured to have internet speeds around ten times as fast as 3G. Analysts also expect a second, cheaper handset - dubbed iPhone 6 -  to be announced as early as 27 September. It will be the first time in Apple's iPhone history that the company has unveiled two handsets in the same month. We Are Social's figures contradict a recent study from Quality Insight in Korea. The marketing firm surveyed 44,168 people about their handset and the iPhone was rated the best smartphone. The participants said that the iPhone rarely failed, with only 17 per cent complaining about technical issues with their Apple phone. This is compared to 31 per cent who reported issues with Samsung phones ranging from battery charging problems to screen quality issues. Apple’s faults were related to touch or button errors. According to recent figures from uSwitch, the iPhone is still the UK’s favourite mobile phone - topping the chart for a fourth consecutive month. Samsung’s Galaxy S4 has so far failed to emulate the S3’s resounding success although the Samsung Galaxy range still dominates with five handsets in the top ten, compared to Apple’s three. No new entries were recorded for June, despite the recent high-profile launch of the Nokia Lumia 925.","The iPhone 5 was the most criticised handset on social networks .

"A student has told how she was forced to undergo a mastectomy aged just 19 – two years after her doctor failed to spot that she had cancer. Morag McTiernan, who was 17 when she first suffered symptoms, believes her age was the reason her GP did not suspect the disease was their cause. Breast cancer is incredibly rare in teenagers, and only four are diagnosed with it in the UK each year – a chance of one in half a million. Scroll down for video . Mhairi, 53 and Peter McTiernan, 57, are running the 13 mile Great North Run this weekend to raise money for North East Teenage Cancer Trust, who supported daughter Morag, 21, when she suffered breast cancer . But Miss McTiernan, now 21, believes she might have been able to keep her breast had the disease been spotted sooner, and has now spoken out to warn other young girls. She said: ‘I can’t help but think that if I had been an older lady who had the same symptoms my GP would have thought about cancer. ‘There were two years between the pain starting and eventually being diagnosed. ‘Who knows how much the cancer could have grown in that time, I might have been able to keep my breast if it was diagnosed sooner.’ Miss McTiernan, from Middlesbrough, first went to her GP in 2010 because of pain in her right breast as well as discharge, but she was told that it was an infection of the milk duct. Miss McTiernan, 21, from Middlesbrough was forced to undergo a mastectomy to remove her right breast when she was just 19 (pictured left) but has fully recovered (pictured right) Miss McTiernan, pictured with her family, said she believes had her disease been detected earlier, she might have had a chance to keep her breast. She said she thinks her age played a part in her misdiagnosis . But the pain eventually became so bad that the teenager, who was studying performing arts and was a keen ballet and contemporary dancer at the time, went to get a second opinion. The first symptom of breast cancer most women notice is a lump or an area of thickened tissue in their breast. Most lumps (90%) are not cancerous, but it is always best to have them checked by your doctor. See your GP if you notice any of the following: . · a lump or area of thickened tissue in either breast . · a change in the size or shape of one or both breasts . · discharge from either of your nipples (which may be streaked with blood) · a lump or swelling in either of your armpits . · dimpling on the skin of your breasts . · a rash on or around your nipple . · a change in the appearance of your nipple, such as becoming sunken into your breast . · pain in either of your breasts or armpits not related to your period . Source: NHS Choices . She said: ‘I couldn’t dance and I kept just thinking, they said this was normal, it’s nothing serious. But I was wrong. ‘I went to a different GP and they put me at ease, explained it was probably nothing to worry about but referred me to a specialist breast clinic for tests.’ Two days later Miss McTiernan was told she had breast cancer. She said: ‘I should have been more shocked, but I was kind of expecting it, I knew something was really wrong. ‘I was referred to the Royal Victoria Hospital in Newcastle where they have a teenage cancer unit for a lumpectomy. ‘But later that week I was told that the cancer was bigger than they had expected and so I had to have a mastectomy. ‘It was horrible news, I would have done anything to avoid that surgery. I was dead against it from the start, but I knew that the surgeon knew best. ‘The operation did take away the cancer and that’s what’s important. ‘I have had the breast reconstructed and had both things done during one operation so when I woke up it was all done.’ Miss McTiernan has recovered from her surgery and has also undergone radiotherapy and hormone treatment. She is looking forward to returning to university in Sunderland this month, but said her attitude to life has changed. Before being diagnosed with breast cancer, Miss McTiernan was studying performing arts in Sunderland . She said: ‘I don’t make plans any more, you literally never know what life is going to throw at you. The cancer has definitely made me a stronger person and it has taught me to accept whatever life has in store for me.’ Her parents, Mhairi, 53 and Peter, 57, are running the Great North Run this weekend to thank the North East’s Teenage Cancer Trust for its support in looking after their daughter. Dr Mark Verrill, a consultant medical oncologist at the Freeman Hospital in Newcastle, said: ‘Breast cancer in young women is exceptionally rare. The chance of being diagnosed in this age bracket is one in 500,000.’ She said facing the disease has changed her attitude to life.

"A pensioner branded a neighbour from hell has been warned that she must keep the peace for six months or face a fine after destroying a homeowner's flower bed - in an apparent row over a squirrel. Marion Webster, 78, has been reported to police at least 40 times by long-suffering neighbours for her anti-social behaviour. She was found guilty of criminal damage last October for tearing out £50 of flowers from a neighbour's flower beds at Solihull Magistrates Court. 'Neighbour from hell': Marion Webster has been warned by magistrates to keep the peace for six months after she was found guilty of criminal damage after ripping up a homeowner's flowerbeds . And yesterday she was ordered by magistrates to keep the peace for six months and warned she would be fined £50 if she continued to torment her neighbours. Neighbours say that the attack on the flowers came after Miss Webster became convinced that a resident had trained a squirrel to enter her garden. Kaya Ball, prosecuting, said police had been called to the pensioner's home numerous times over the past decade. She said: 'This isn't just an isolated incident of cutting some flowers. 'On the face of it, it seems trivial, but when it is presented as part of a long-standing neighbour dispute you can see there are several incidents.' But Sam Christopher, defending, said she was an elderly lady of 'previous good character.' Following sentencing, neighbours today branded Webster 'a neighbour from hell' and expressed anger at her lenient sentence. Row: Neighbours say that Miss Webster attacked a neighbour's flowers after a row over a squirrel that had been coming into her garden . One said: 'The last thing you expect to have when you move into a nice quiet neighbourhood like this one is an elderly woman acting like a yob. 'She is very proud of her garden and she got it into her head that someone had it in for her and was jealous of her flowers. 'She put up a big metal gate, extended the height of her fences and made the place into a fortress. 'Then she became convinced a resident had trained a squirrel to enter her garden after dark and tear up her flowers but everyone thought it was a joke. 'One night she cut someone's flowers up and tore up plants from the roots.' Another reported her to police for playing loud classical music at 3am. One claimed: 'She seems to enjoy causing a fuss and making everyone's life hell.' West Midlands Police confirmed they had been contacted more than 40 times since 2002 about alleged incidents including claims from Webster herself that she was a victim of flower vandals. A spokeswoman said: 'The force has been working in partnership with a vulnerable persons officer, social services and Solihull Community Housing to engage with everybody concerned and to resolve the problems in the area. 'There have been no complaints since October 2012.'","Marion Webster was found guilty of criminal damage .

Using a pick axe, Katey, an ecologist at the University of Alaska, pierces the bubble trapped in the ice. As gas rushes out from the hole, one of her students holds a lighted match towards it and ignites the vapour, causing it to explode. Katey said: 'My job's the worst, because usually you catch on fire. It could be 10 or 30 litres of methane per day from one little hole, and it does that all year. 'And then you realise there are hundreds of spots like that and millions of lakes. The methane bubbles have been described as 'ice grenades' that are waiting to explode . Lake of fire: This peaceful scene could easily be transformed into a nightmare Hellish vision . Pull the pin: A close-up of one of the 'ice grenades', ready to explode . 'What's coming out of Arctic lakes is troubling, because some of it seems to be coming not from the bottom mud, but from deeper geologic reservoirs that had been securely capped by permafrost. 'And that contain hundreds of times more methane than is in the atmosphere now.' Katey is conducting research and by counting and measuring each bubble she hopes to work out how much methane is rising from the Goldstream Lake in Canada. If the temperature of the planet continues to rise massive quantities of the gas could be released into the atmosphere with potentially deadly effects. An ecologist deploys a gas trap to collect methane gas bubbling up from the bottom of the frozen lake . What lies beneath: One of the ecologists stands above two trapped bubbles of methane . The trapped methane is collected and removed safely . Double bubble: Another of the trapped bubbles beneath the Alaskan lake . Some lakes, she says, have 'hot spots' where the methane bubbling is so strong that ice never forms, leaving open holes big enough to spot from an airplane . She said: 'If we could only capture it, it would make a great energy source.' Methane is a deadly greenhouse gas and produces 25 times more heat than carbon dioxide, unless you burn it first. By venting and burning the methane it converts the potent gas into less dangerous CO which could be used to produce power for mankind.

"Everton manager Roberto Martinez has praised chairman Bill Kenwright for providing him with a strong enough squad to compete in the Premier League and Europe. Martinez's side face Lille in Europa League Group H on Thursday night knowing victory would virtually guarantee qualificiation for the knockout stages. And the confident Spaniard says he could make up to six changes without weakening the strength of his line-up even without the injured Antolin Alcaraz, Arouna Kone, John Stones, Bryan Oviedo and Kevin Mirallas. Everton boss Roberto Martinez is happy with the size of his squad following a summer of recruitment . Ross Barkley (left) and Tim Howard (right) train at Finch Farm on Wednesday evening . Samuel Eto'o (left), pictured scoring against Burnley, was one of five permanent signings made by Everton . 'We showed by beating Aston Villa then getting a draw in Lille that we can make changes and perform in a manner to get results. 'At the start of the season, the chairman (Kenwright) and chief executive made sure we had a big enough squad to play Thursday-Sunday. 'We have 23 outfield players who have shown what they can do for the team. I don't see a weakened side by making four, five or six changes. 'To become a big club with the right mentality, we need to make changes. You always want to win the next game, as simple as that.' Left back Leighton Baines (right) will definitely start the Group H clash at Goodison Park on Thursday night . Winger Aiden McGeady (left) could be one of the players Martinez decides to rest against Lille . Everton have collected five points from their three European games so far to top the group. Antolin Alcaraz's shoulder injury sustained on Saturday will keep him out between six and 12 weeks with 36-year-old Sylvain Distin expected to replace him. 'We lost Antolin at the weekend,' Martinez said. 'He has dislocated his AC joint on his shoulder and will be out for a while.' Martinez said Alcaraz's length of time on the sidelines would be determined by whether or not he will need to undergo surgery. Defender Antolin Alcaraz could be out for up to 12 weeks after dislocating the AC joint in his right shoulder . 'With Antolin it is difficult because the decision now is if he needs surgery or not,' Martinez added. 'It is a decision we are going to measure well and make the right call. It would depend - between six and 12 weeks, depending on the route we are taking.' Full-backs Leighton Baines and Seamus Coleman will play. '100 per cent, they are the best pair of full-backs in England,' smiled Martinez. 'In previous years, full-backs only had to defend – it was a bonus if they crossed the halfway line. But now they have to be able to defend one-on-one, and help offensively too.'","Everton host Lille at Goodison Park on Thursday night, kick-off 8.05pm .

"An unlicensed driver who mowed down four cyclists, killing two, in New Hampshire has been sentenced to up to 40 years in prison for manslaughter and assault. Darriean Hess, 20, was high was on the powerful prescription painkiller fentanyl when she cross the center life and smashed into a cyclists on a charity bike ride in Seabrook, New Hampshire, in 2013. The wreck killed 60-year-old Pamela Wells and 52-year-old Elise Bouchard just after the start of the Granite State Wheelmen Tri-State Seacoast Century ride. Taken away: Darriean Hess, pictured in court on Monday, was sentenced to 15 to 40 years in prison for killing two cyclists and injuring two others in September 2013 . Hess, pictured in court (left) and in a Facebook post (right), said few words and mostly stared at the table while victims' families spoke out on Monday . She barely spoke in court and stared down at the table as her victims' families - and one of the surviving cyclists - gave emotional testimony about the horror of her crime. 'You changed my world. The whole universe changed. Two of the kindest, most wonderful women were taken from all of us. The world is a darker place today,' Margo Heigh told Darriean Hess, according to WMUR-TV.

Her mother had recently tragically died and she dropped out of college to take care of her younger siblings before moving to Alaska and then back to New Hampshire. She was pulled out and given a speeding ticket just eight hours before the crash - but still took to the road despite not having a valid license. The court room in Brentwood, New Hampshire, was packed with friends and family members of the victims - as well as Hess' family members. Hess was sentenced to 15 to 40 years in prison - with seven to 14 years suspended. Some of the victims' relatives had advocated for a longer sentence because of the recklessness of the crime. Others said Hess should receive leniency and a second chance.","Darriean Hess, 20, was sentenced to 15 to 40 years in prison, with seven to 14 years suspended .

"A grieving mother has released this poignant picture of her daughter crying moments after being born at 24 weeks. Emily Caines wants to show how developed her baby was at this stage of pregnancy – the legal limit for abortions in Britain. Adelaide survived for only about an hour after she was delivered by doctors who tried in vain to keep her alive. Scroll down for video . Emily Caines, 25, from Yeovil in Somerset has released a photograph of the moment her premature daughter Adelaide was born as she hopes to break the taboo over talking about baby loss . Mrs Caines, who previously lost two daughters, underwent IVF treatment and is now pregnant. She calls her son, who is due in January 2015, her 'rainbow child' because rainbows  appear after the storm . This is Mrs Caines’ only picture of her daughter, and was taken by one of the medics before the infant died. She and her husband Alastair, a security guard, think the legal limit of 24 weeks for an abortion should be lowered. ‘Our picture shows Adelaide was not a foetus,’ said Mrs Caines, 35, from Yeovil, Somerset. ‘She was a fully formed human being, and to think that a baby like her could be legally terminated is to me horrifying.’ She added: ‘Our hospital was amazing but Adelaide suffered complications which made it impossible for her to survive. ‘But many babies born at 24 weeks do live. That makes a mockery of the 24-week legal limit. ‘Our daughter may not have lived long but she was still our daughter and we love to talk about her and celebrate her life.’ Emily and Alastair Caines fell in love in the agonising weeks after Mrs Caines lost her first daughter Isabelle . Mrs Caines, who also lost her first baby, at 23 weeks, continued: ‘I find it hurtful when people use the term late miscarriage to describe our daughter because she was born so early into my pregnancy. I think this picture of her crying out shows that clearly that is not the case. ‘I went through labour and delivery with both of my premature babies. ‘My first daughter was born at 23 weeks and classed as a late miscarriage. Adelaide was born at 24 weeks and classed as neo-natal death but they looked exactly the same. Neither were a miscarriage. ‘Adelaide lived for more than an hour and will always be very much part of our lives. ‘I hope this beautiful picture of my daughter being born helps change people’s perspectives.’ Medical advances mean significant numbers of premature babies are surviving being born at just 23 weeks into a pregnancy. The couple's daughter Adelaide was born at just 24 weeks old, but unfortunately doctors told Mr and Mrs Caines they couldn't get a line in to help her breathe . On their wedding day Mrs Caines said she woke up, put on a bracelet to remember her deceased daughter, and then pulled on her wedding dress to get married . Research shows many British specialist neo-natal units have vastly improved on survival rates. Data from 25 hospitals over the past four years shows that 120 babies born at 23 weeks survived. Around 560 babies are aborted at 23 weeks every year. Mrs Caines, who works in customer services, married her 29-year-old husband on the anniversary of the birth and death of her first child, Isabelle. Adelaide was conceived through IVF and her parents were relieved to reach the 24-week stage, when medics are legally obliged to help save the life of a premature baby. Mrs Caines said: ‘Only then did I buy her a baby-grow and Alistair bought her a pink cuddly bunny.’ Mr and Mrs Caines married on September 8th 2012 in a villa in Portugal. This day was the anniversary of Mrs Caines' first daughter Isabella's birth and death . The Caines family and their friends have now raised more than £4,000 for the stillbirth and neonatal death charity Sands . Wide-eyed and curious, these twin boys had a dramatic start in life when their mother gave birth at just 23 weeks. One-year-olds Jake and Kyle were barely the size of a hand when they were born on September 21 last year, weighing 1lb 6oz and 1lb 7oz. Their skin was so weak their parents Nichola Baird, 30, and her partner Colin, 42, couldn’t even touch them for nine days, and both needed heart surgery. Miss Baird, of South Tyneside, said she felt her sons were ‘treated like foetuses’, but despite dire predictions they were eventually allowed to be taken home on their exact due date. But only three days later Mrs Caines started to bleed and was taken to the specialist premature baby unit at Southmead Hospital in Bristol. In December 2013 she had an emergency caesarean section. Her husband stayed by her side as their tiny daughter let out a cry as she was delivered by doctors. It was at that moment a doctor took the only picture of Adelaide alive on the couple’s camera. Mrs Caines said: ‘That cry filled us with so much hope. Her little fists were waving and I could see the doctors working on her.’ But an hour later doctors told the couple that it was proving impossible to get a line into their daughter’s lungs to help her breathe. They agreed that the kindest thing they could do would be to let her go. Mrs Caines, who is raising money for the stillbirth and neonatal charity Sands, is now 20 weeks pregnant with a son following another round of IVF. She said: ‘I hope sharing our story gives hope to others and helps other parents who have suffered a loss.’ To support her fundraising visit her Just Giving page.","Emily Caines, 25, has released photograph of birth of daughter Adelaide .

"Andy Murray could announce Amelie Mauresmo as his long-term coach as early as next week. The deposed Wimbledon champion met Mauresmo on Thursday, a day after his meek quarter-final defeat by Grigor Dimitrov, and wants to finalise arrangements before departing for a training camp in Miami at the end of next week. But there are still pertinent issues to be ironed about between Mauresmo and the rest of Murray’s support team. Backroom: Andy Murray could announce Amelie Mauresmo as his long-term coach next week . Support team: Andy Murray's coach Amelie Mauresmo (right) and Dani Vallverdu at Wimbledon . Fallout: Murray's quarter-final exit at Wimbledon has led to him having to re-assess his team . Assistant coach Dani Vallverdu was understood to be unhappy about the timing of Mauresmo’s appointment - though not the decision to hire the Frenchwoman - and even considered ending his four-year stint working with Murray. Fitness trainer Jez Green has also been unsettled and wants a clear structure to be established if Mauresmo is to continue working with the Scot. Both men have sought reassurances about their positions. But Murray’s camp insist talks have progressed well, while the intention was always to trial working with Mauresmo during the grass-court season before making a more formal, long-term agreement if the pair were happy. Apart from reassuring some other members of Team Murray there are still several stumbling blocks to overcome. Pushing himself? Or maybe, the disastrous performance was all down to Murray himself?

"Repented: Gary Carl Simmons was said to apologize for the grisly murder he committed in 1996 . Mississippi executed a grocery store butcher on Wednesday who was found guilty of using his meat carving knives to dismember a man and then scattering the body parts in an alligator-infested bayou in 1996. Gary Carl Simmons, 49, received a lethal injection at the Mississippi State Penitentiary in Parchman and was pronounced dead at 6.16pm, corrections spokesman Adam Lee said. Simmons requested a massive last meal that would have fed a dozen people. The Mississippi blog GulfLive reported that in full he asked for one Pizza Hut medium Super Supreme Deep Dish pizza, double portion, with mushrooms, onions, jalapeno peppers, and pepperoni; pizza, regular portion, with three cheeses, olives, bell pepper, tomato, garlic and Italian sausage; 10 8-oz. packs of Parmesan cheese; 10 8-oz. packs of ranch dressing; one family size back of Doritos nacho cheese flavor; 8 oz. jalapeno nacho cheese; 4 oz. sliced jalapenos; 2 large strawberry shakes; two 20-oz. cherry Cokes; one super-size order of McDonald's fries with extra ketchup and mayonnaise; and two pints of strawberry ice cream. It is not clear if he ate it all, but that last meal would come in at almost 30,000 calories. Ninety minutes before his execution, at a 4:45 press conference, the Department of Corrections claimed he had eaten about half his mean, sampled everything but the chips, and was still eating. Simmons epic last meal request included multiple pizzas, a family sized back of Nacho flavored Doritos, two bottles of Cherry Coke, a super size McDonald's fries, ten large packets of ranch dressing, five pounds of Parmesan cheese, two pints of strawberry ice cream and more .

Mississippi now has executed six inmates . in 2012, already the highest number carried out by the state in a single . year since 1956, when there were eight executions. Simmons was convicted of the August 1996 murder of 21-year-old Jeffery Wolfe. According to records from the Mississippi Supreme Court, Wolfe and his girlfriend drove from Houston to Mississippi to collect a drug debt of between $12,000 and $20,000. But when they got to Simmons' house, Simmons and his accomplice, Timothy Milano, told Wolfe they did not have the drugs or the money, records showed. An argument erupted, and Milano fatally shot Wolfe with a .22-caliber rifle, records showed. Simmons then hog-tied and locked Wolfe's girlfriend in a foot locker, removing her later to rape her and 'telling her that her life depended on how well she performed sexually,' the court document said. Afterward, Simmons put the woman back inside the box and went into the bathroom, where he dismembered and gutted Wolfe's body in the bathtub using knives he had sharpened at work, the records showed. Simmons and Milano scattered the victim's remains in a bayou behind Simmons' property, according to documents. Wolfe's girlfriend managed to escape from the foot locker and ran to a neighbor's house to call police, records showed. Simmons was sentenced to death after being convicted in August 1997 of kidnapping, rape and capital murder. Milano was sentenced to life in prison. Simmons 'said he made peace with God and that he was remorseful,' Mississippi Department of Corrections Commissioner Chris Epps said at a news conference ahead of the execution. Gary Carl Simmons ate pizza, parmesan cheese, ranch dressing, chips, jalapeno nacho cheese and peppers, strawberry milkshakes, cherry soda, french fries and strawberry ice cream for his last meal. Here are a few other notable final dinners: . John Wayne Gacey, who murdered 33 teenage boys and young men in Illinois the 1970s, asked for 12 fried shrimp, a bucket of original recipe KFC, french fries and a pound of fresh strawberries. Lawrence Russel Brewer, a white supremacist convicted of killing a black man by dragging him behind his truck in Texas in 1998, ordered two chicken-fried steaks, a triple bacon cheeseburger, a cheese omelet, a large bowl of fried okra, three fajitas, one pound of barbeque with half a loaf of white bread, a Meat Lovers pizza, three root beers, one pint of Blue Bell vanilla ice cream and a slab of peanut butter fudge with crushed peanuts. He refused to eat any of it when it arrived before his execution in September 2011. As a result, Texas corrections officials no longer serve condemned inmates last meals. Robert Dale Conklin, who used a screwdriver to kill his gay lover then dissected his body in 1984 in Georgia, received filet mignon wrapped with bacon, de-veined shrimp sautéed in garlic butter with lemon, baked potato with butter, sour cream, chives and real bacon bits, corn on the cob, asparagus with hollandaise sauce, French bread with butter, goat cheese, cantaloupe, apple pie, vanilla bean ice cream and iced tea. Victor Feguer, who kidnapped and murdered an Iowa doctor in 1960, asked for a single olive, with the pit still in it, served on a large plate with a fork and knife. After he was hanged, the pit was found in his suit pocket.","Gary Carl Simmons, 49, convicted of a 1996 murder in Mississippi .

"Climate change will bring greater extremes in weather, the Government's outgoing chief scientific adviser has warned. Professor Sir John Beddington said the effects of climate change on the weather were already being felt in the UK, as he called for urgent action to tackle global warming. He also forecast there would soon be 'massive problems in the world', exacerbated by the fact there will be an estimated one billion more people on the planet in just 12 years' time. 'In a sense we have moved from the idea of global warming to the idea of climate change, and that is rather important - yes, indeed, temperatures are increasing but the thing that is going to happen is that we are going to see much more variability in our weather,' he told BBC Breakfast. Climate change will bring greater extremes in weather, the Government's outgoing chief scientific adviser has warned. Pictured is a storm in Jakarta, Java, Indonesia . Heaby snow on the M62 leading to West Yorkshire. Professor Sir John Beddington said the effects of climate change on the weather were already being felt in the UK, as he called for urgent action to tackle global warming . 'I think you only have to look at the last few years to see how that is actually starting to manifest itself even in the UK.' Sir John said there were 'massive problems' in the world of food, water and energy security as the global population increases, all of which would be exacerbated by climate change. Even if effective action was taken now on global warming, he said there would be 'significant' climate change over the next 20 to 25 years as results of past global emissions. Cod Beck Reservoir near Osmotherley, in North Yorkshire, where the once picturesque reservoir was reduced to dried cracked mud. Sir John said there were 'massive problems' in the world of food, water and energy security as the global population increases . 'We have massive problems in the world - in 12 years' time there will be another billion people on the planet and we have big issues of food security, water security and energy security and many, many people will start to be living in cities,' he said. Earth is warmer today than it has been for most of the last 11,300 years, research from from Oregon State University in the US has shown. Scientists studied fossils recovered from 73 sites around the world to track global climate to the end of the last Ice Age. They found that for 70 per cent to 80 per cent of this period, which dates back to the start of the holocene era in which we now live, temperatures were cooler than they are now. The research shows that over the past 5,000 years the Earth underwent an overall cooling of around 0.5C. But in just the last 100 years - since the start of the industrial age - it has warmed by the same amount. 'These are massive problems; climate change is just going to make it worse.' He said there were some 'uncertainties' in the analysis of climate and climate change. 'But those uncertainties are completely outweighed by the enormous body of evidence that shows it is happening and is happening in the sort of ways climate models would expect,' he said. 'For example the Arctic is heating up vastly faster than other parts of the world - this is exactly what the climate scientists are predicting.' Sir John's remarks were made as Britain experienced freezing cold weather and snow, with thousands of homes across the UK without power and many roads still impassable. Almost 8,000 homes and businesses were flooded in 2012, as the UK was battered by repeated heavy rain, storms and floods. England and Wales experienced 10 separate flooding events between April and December last year after widespread drought gave way to the wettest summer in a century, with unusually high rainfall totals and river levels around the country.

In most species the gills are prominently displayed on their dorsal surface. Scientists believe they may have evolved such extraordinary anatomy as a form of camouflage to mimick their surroundings and avoid predators. Another theory is that they are an example of aposematism, an attempt to warn potential predators that they could be poisonous to eat. Even their egg masses are often red, pink, orange or any other colour depending on the species. In tropical waters, beachwalkers can find nudibranchs in tidal pools at low tide.

"Atletico Madrid chief executive Miguel Angel Gil Marin has described the violent clashes that left one Deportivo La Coruna fan dead and several people injured as 'disgusting' and said there is no place in football for the 'scum' responsible. Trouble erupted before Atletico's home Primera Division match with Depor on Sunday morning and resulted in the death of a man in his 40s. The man, who has not been named officially, was still alive when firefighters pulled him out of the Manzanares river near Atletico's home ground. Deportivo La Coruna and Atletico Madrid fans clash outside Vicente Calderon Stadium on Sunday . In a critical condition, he was taken to the San Carlos Clinic in Madrid by ambulance but died shortly after. 'A patient, a male in his 40s, arrived at the hospital with cardiac arrest and suffering from hypothermia. Despite lengthy attempts to resuscitate him, he could not recover from the cardiac arrest and died,' Isabel Diez, press officer at San Carlos Clinic, told Press Association Sport. 'We don't know the exact causes as only an autopsy can determine.' The running battles between rival 'ultras' - hardcore supporters - reportedly started around 9am in the vicinity of Atletico's Vicente Calderon stadium ahead of a match that began at midday local time (1100GMT). Rival fans were filmed throwing objects at each other on and near the road alongside the Manzanares river . The man  was taken out of the river suffering head injuries, cardiac arrest and hypothermia, before dying . According to El Pais newspaper, 20 people have been arrested and more identified following the trouble which lasted for around an hour and was said to have involved up to 200 people. Among those injured, three were reportedly from stab wounds and a policeman was also hurt. Gil Marin said on his club's website: 'It's disgusting, that scum has no place in football. I only hope they identify those responsible and they can't repeat such deplorable acts as these.' The Atletico chief also distanced genuine football fans from the trouble, adding: 'This is a social issue linked to political thoughts because hooligans of Rayo are coupled with hooligans the Deportivo to fight with hooligans of Atletico Madrid. 'This isn't football, it has nothing to do with that. It's a disgrace and deplorable. We will listen to the police and authorities and decide what measures can be taken beyond those which have already been taken, which are many. 'If someone is able to identify who has done it, please report it, because it's very important that those responsible end up in prison. Also, let all the people of football join together to try and avoid a repeat of this tragedy.' Depor president Tino Fernandez echoed those thoughts, although he said he was not aware of the exact details of what had happened. Deportivo La Coruna fans raise their scarves during their match against Atletico Madrid on Sunday . Atletico's Arda Turan shapes to cross in his side's 2-0 win over Deportivo La Coruna . He said: 'It's tragic and horrendous news. Our thoughts are with the family of the deceased. We are at his family and friends' complete disposal to help them in any way we can.' Depor coach Victor Fernandez said after the match: 'It's one of the saddest days in Spanish football in recent years. They are reprehensible and despicable acts.' Spanish league authorities (the LFP) also condemned the trouble and had wanted the match - which was won 2-0 by Atletico - to be postponed but said it was not possible. The LFP also offered their condolences to the family of the man who died, as did the Spanish Football Federation (RFEF). RFEF general secretary Jorge Perez also explained that, after only receiving information about the seriousness of the incidents just before kick-of, it was considered 'counter-productive' to postpone the match due to security reasons. He said in Marca: 'Eleven minutes before the start of Atletico Madrid-Deportivo, Victoriano Sanchez Arminio (president of the referee's committee) received a call from the LFP and another from the match referee. 'He spoke with a member of the RFEF and, with the stadium full and little time left, for reasons of security and public order it was decided that it could be counter-productive to suspend it.'","A 43-year-old Deportivo fan died after suffering head injuries .

"It has eight bedrooms, an indoor swimming pool and a private cinema, making it the family home of anyone's dreams - but only if you have £17.5m to spare. Furze Croft is a newly-built classical mansion in Weybridge, Surrey, and comes with 1.74 acres of beautifully landscaped grounds, huge living spaces and a 1,700-bottle wine cellar. The  developers  say it 'has been designed to be a real family home', but it certainly goes far beyond what most of us are used to in our day-to-day lives. Scroll down for video . Coming in at a whopping £17.5m, Furze Croft, in Weybridge, Surrey, is a new build in a classical design. It has eight bedrooms, a private cinema and an indoor pool . The main drawing room area comes off the entrance hall and is centred around a large fireplace and has French windows which open out into the garden . The master bedroom has its own private balcony, as well as twin walk-in dressing rooms and ensuite bathrooms. It is one of six bedroom suites . The beautiful mansion has two wings and nearly two acres of landscaped gardens. Its developers say it was designed to be a 'real family home' Once you've made it through the grand gates and up the gravel driveway, complete with feature landscaped turning circle, you open the front door onto a huge double volume entrance hall, with a sweeping staircase and glass roof cupola. From the entrance hall you can reach the 18-seater dining room, plush double drawing room and the kitchen and breakfast room, which open right out onto the flagstone paved terrace and back garden through French windows. Furze Croft has also been designed for entertaining on an extra large scale. One wing contains a large VIP entertaining suite consisting of a custom-made bar and drinks lounge. Folding glass doors can be opened to merge this space with the outside terrace,which creates a space big enough to entertain 200 guests - more than most people are used to on their average weekend. The large, open entrance hall has a marble floor and opens out into the double drawing room, 18-seater dining room and kitchen and breakfast room . The bright entrance hall features a sweeping staircase and glass roof cupola, giving a suitably dramatic first impression of the house . The light-filled breakfast room is attached to the kitchen, has a breakfast bar and backs onto the huge expanse of gardens . There is an indoor swimming pool and hot tub for when it's time to relax, with space for loungers at pool-side and huge doors opening up to the garden . The house is located on East Road in St George's Hill estate, where former residents include Elton John, Tom Jones and a host of footballers including Frank Lampard and John Terry. As well as the indoor swimming pool, complete with pool-side loungers, it boats a hot tub, while the bathrooms have super-deep baths and giant power showers. Steve Glover, founding director of developers Consero London said: 'Despite its size, Furze Croft has been designed to be a real family home that pleases and impresses its occupants and visitors. We have carefully balanced its large entertaining rooms with cosy and intimate informal spaces where the family can relax and interact. Furze Croft has been designed for large-scale entertaining, with a reception area that can open up to hold more than 200 people . The kitchen is fitted out with top-of-the-range modern appliances and has a built-in island area and kitchen table, as well as French windows . When you walk through the grand gates and the entrance hall you reach the 18-seater dining room, perfect for dinner parties . 'The local housing market is lacking brand-new 21st century mansions of this quality and advanced specification. St George's Hill is one of the finest private estates outside of central London, making Furze Croft both a good turn-key investment as well an outstanding country retreat close to the capital.' The house took two years to build and is set over lower ground, ground and first floors. The developers are expecting interest from Russian and Middle Eastern millionaires. It has six bedroom suites, consisting of a master bedroom with a private terrace overlooking the gardens, twin walk-in dressing rooms and twin ensuite bathrooms. Four have walk-in dressing rooms and ensuites and the other also has an ensuite. The house's interior oozes wealth, and developers are hoping it gets snapped up by wealthy Russian or Middle Eastern buyers . There is an extra-large garage big enough for four limousines or large saloon cars, with access to the house via a side lobby . The massive walk-in dressing rooms mean you will never again have trouble digging out your favourite shirt . The top-of-the-range super-deep baths and power showers mean the spacious bathrooms are pure luxury . On the first floor of one wing there is also a two-bedroom staff apartment with self-contained kitchen and sitting room, which could alternatively serve as an annex. The other wing houses the 11-metre long, 2.1-metre deep  pool, a gym, sauna and changing/toilet facilities.

This floor also has a wine display suite with a glass-enclosed, temperature-controlled wine room capable of holding a whopping 1,700 bottles of fine wines and spirits. The mansion has been built using some of the finest materials and craftsmen  from around the world.  Botticino Fiorito marble flooring has been used across the house, while the design theme is evident in every room. The wine cellar is big enough for an incredible 1,700 bottles, meaning this family home is not short of entertainment facilities .

"Emergency laws to record phone calls, texts and people's internet history could be rushed through Parliament, amid growing fears over the threat posed by radicalised British Muslims returning from Syria. Ministers have been forced to act after the European courts ruled that Government powers to monitor people's phone and internet records were illegal. The Government is concerned that the April ruling has left a gaping hole in the security services ability to track and prosecute terrorists. Scroll down for video . UK-based terrorists fighting in Syria - such as Abu Muthana Al Yemeni (centre), Abu Bara' Al Hindi (right) and Abu Dujana Al Hindi (left) who all claim to have come from Britain - could pose a threat when they return, ministers believe . Labour and the Lib Dems are now prepared to support new laws reintroducing the old surveillance powers before next year's general election. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg has rejected accusations that the new laws amount to a 'snoopers' charter' being introduced through the back door. Last year Mr Clegg blocked Theresa May's controversial communications data bill - which would have dramatically increased the Government's ability to monitor people's phone and internet usage. The Tories are expected to reintroduce the bill if they win the next election. The wider issue of phone and internet surveillance had been expected to have been shelved until after the election, but the European court's ruling has forced the Government to act sooner than expected . Labour is likely to suggest that the new emergency laws should have some form of 'sunset clause' to review them after a set period, the Guardian reported this morning. Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper has also argued for a wider review of the powers given to the security services. Home Secretary Theresa May is concerned that a European court ruling makes it harder for the security services and police to monitor terror threats . A Liberal Democrat source said Nick Clegg was open-minded about boosting Government powers but said: 'There is no question of a snooper's charter, watered down or otherwise, being introduced by this government.' The source added: 'The government does have to respond to the European court of justice ruling, which we are currently examining, and will respond in due course. But that is about the retention of existing powers rather than their extension.' A Home Office spokesperson said: 'The retention of communications data is absolutely fundamental to ensure law enforcement have the powers they need to investigate crime, protect the public and ensure national security. 'We are carefully considering the European court of justice's judgment on data retention and are currently examining potential next steps.' But Emma Carr, acting director of Big Brother Watch, said: 'It would be reckless to attempt to legislate on further surveillance powers before a comprehensive, independent review of the existing legal framework has taken place. 'A broad political consensus has emerged in support of a comprehensive review in recognition of the fact that the public should know more about how existing surveillance laws are being used and whether the current oversight mechanisms are adequate. 'It is a basic principle of a free society that you don’t monitor people who are not under suspicion. Considering the Snoopers Charter has already been rejected by the public as well as by the highest court in Europe, it is essential that the Government does not rush head first into creating new legislation. 'The EU’s data retention laws privatised snooping, meaning companies were paid by governments to record what citizens were doing and retain that information for a year. 'We need to get back to a point where the police monitor people who are actually suspected of wrong doing and rather than wasting millions every year requiring data to be stored on an indiscriminate basis.'","Cross party talks to introduce new powers following a European court ruling .

"Scottish Labour leader Johann Lamont is facing a growing leadership crisis amid claims that Jim Murphy is plotting her downfall this week. At the party's UK conference in Manchester there are strong rumours that Miss Lamont is 'ready' to quit, although this was slapped down by her supporters. The party is bracing itself for more in-fighting and soul-searching following last week's referendum, and the Scottish Daily Mail revealed yesterday that former Scottish Secretary Mr Murphy is already being lined up as the next leader. Scroll down for video . The Labour party in Scotland is in the grip of in-fighting, amid claims Johann Lamont (centre) could quit to make way for Jim Murphy (left) as the party's leader north of the border . However, sources close to Miss Lamont accused Mr Murphy of trying to undermine her leadership, with rumours that a private meeting of his supporters has been scheduled. 'It's a bit rich that those who refused to stand for the job when the party was in its darkest hour now think they are the answer,' said one insider. While the party fights among itself, Scotland's future has become one of the main topics in Manchester, with UK leader Ed Miliband today set to use his keynote speech to warn: 'A country that nearly splits apart is not a country in good health.' Mr Miliband yesterday praised Scottish politicians who helped defeat the threat of independence, however he gaffed by failing to thank former Prime Minister Gordon Brown. Although Scots strongly backed the Union in last week's referendum, the Yes campaign triumphed in Labour's heartlands of Glasgow, North Lanarkshire and West Dunbartonshire – including in Miss Lamont's own seat of Glasgow Pollok. That has triggered despair within the party, and one source said: 'Nobody now expects Johann to lead the party into 2016.' However, Miss Lamont told delegates in Manchester: 'I look forward to working with Ed in Number Ten, [and] to lead Scottish Labour to victory in 2016.' Rumours have emerged that Miss Lamont is on the verge of quitting, something he supporters deny . Miss Lamont was elected leader in the wake of the party's 2011 election drubbing, beating MSP Ken Macintosh and MP Tom Harris. She has performed capably in Holyrood, often beating Alex Salmond at First Minister's Questions, and launched a controversial full-scale review of the party's policies in a bid to end the country's 'something for nothing culture'. She is also well liked by members who are grateful to her for taking on the challenge when the party was at its lowest ebb. However, she has struggled to create a public profile for herself and observers claim she now looks 'weary', with Labour still trailing far behind the SNP in the polls. Rumours of her impending resignation came just a day after a Westminster source told the Mail that Jim Murphy is set to be appointed Shadow Scottish Secretary at Ed Miliband's next reshuffle, replacing Margaret Curran. Mr Murphy, who represents East Renfrewshire, was a close ally of Mr Miliband's brother David, and he is unlikely to get his dream job of Foreign Secretary if Ed becomes Prime Minister. Party sources say Mr Muprhy is therefore being lined up as Scottish leader, standing for the top job while still an MP . Party sources say he is therefore being lined up as Scottish leader, standing for the top job while still an MP – like Alex Salmond did with the SNP in 2004 – and then switching to the Scottish Parliament at the 2016 election. Yesterday, current Shadow Scottish Secretary Margaret Curran admitted the party must face up to last week's referendum results in its heartlands. 'We have to be honest when we look at the results and see that some of the people who think that Britain can't work for them are Labour voters,' she told delegates in Manchester. 'They are terrified of Tory governments, they are worried about the future of our public services, and they are looking at their living standards which have been ground down year on year. 'We need to understand why they are angry and what we need to do about it. We need to understand why, in areas like Glasgow, Lanarkshire and Dundee people feel so let down that they want to opt out entirely.' Today, Mr Miliband will say: 'We will show the people of Scotland over the coming years that they made the right choice, because we are better together. 'But let's face it: our country nearly broke up. A country that nearly splits apart is not a country in good health.' He will tell a story about a cleaner called Josephine he met in Scotland, who was considering voting for independence. 'I don't know how she voted, but I do know the question she was asking: is anything going to make life better for me and my family?' he will say. 'I hear Josephine's question everywhere, not just in Scotland. Can anyone build a better future for the working people of Britain?' 'It wasn't just the referendum question. It is the general election question.' Mr Miliband yesterday praised Miss Lamont, Mrs Curran, Better Together chairman Alistair Darling and MPs Anas Sarwar, Jim Murphy and Douglas Alexander. But he failed to mention Gordon Brown, who made a series of high-profile interventions for the No campaign and made one of the best speeches against independence last week. An aide last night insisted the Labour leader has already highly praised Mr Brown. 'I wanted to add my thanks to all of our colleagues for the incredible job they did in keeping our country together,' Mr Miliband said. 'Johann, I want to thank you for the great job you have done and the leadership you have shown. 'Alistair I want to thank you because you could have had an easier life after 2010 and you didn't. You didn't because you care so much about our country and we will forever be indebted to you for that.'","Rumours swirl at party conference that Scottish leader Lamont will quit .

"A university has been stripped of its right to admit foreign students in a move that could have serious implications for other institutions.

Up to 2,600 students could face deportation unless they can find another British university to accept them. Scroll down for video . Demonstration: Foreign students from London's Metropolitan University protest outside downing Street after being told they face deportation due a to a new Government ruling that revokes the sponsorship of their visas .

While London Met is the first . publicly-funded university to lose its licence to sponsor non-EU . students, two others – Glasgow Caledonian and Teesside –  have already . had their licences suspended but then restored.

Probe: London Metropolitan University had its Highly Trusted Status revoked after a damning Government study suggested few were attending lectures, many had a poor grasp of English and a quarter should did not have valid visas . Future in limbo: The university said the implications of the revocation were 'significant and far-reaching' and that their priority was the students and their obligations to them .

It emerged last night that the 60-day . deadline for students to find an alternative course or leave will not be . imposed immediately.

Sir Christopher Snowden, . vice-president of Universities UK, said: ‘The London Met situation is . very serious, not only for that university, but for the whole UK sector. ‘This situation could be interpreted . very adversely by international students, their sponsoring organisations . and potential students considering study in the UK. ‘UK universities contribute over . £8billion to the UK economy through their education of international . students and this type of incident certainly threatens that important . contribution to the economy.’ The Higher Education Funding Council said: . ‘UKBA’s decision does not in any way reflect concern about licensing . arrangements at other universities in the UK.’ Professor Malcolm Gillies, the . university’s vice-chancellor, described the claims made against the . institution as ‘not particularly cogent’ and said it would be disputing . them. ‘I would go so far as to say that UKBA has been rewriting its own . guidelines on this issue,’ he added.

"A model struggles to go on dates with her own boyfriend because she has a rare illness that causes her to fly into fits of rage when she hears somebody eating. Faith Watson, 20, from Newmarket, Suffolk, suffers from misophonia - the hatred of sound - meaning she cannot tolerate certain noises. The slightest chomp or chew can ruin dates with partner of one year, Dave Scott. Faith Watson, 20, has misophonia - the hatred of sound. This means she flies into an uncontrollable rage at the sound of people chewing and at noises such as a pen tapping . Ms Watson said: ‘Certain noises make me feel like strangling someone and I have different triggers for certain people making it hard to control. ‘If Dave and I go to a restaurant there needs to be music on in the background so I don’t have to think about the noises he or other people are making around me. ‘If we have a night in the TV needs to be on quite loud or I can’t stop glaring at him.’ The condition will also have implications for the couple’s Valentine’s Day plans. Ms Watson said: ‘This year we will probably just stay in - my misophonia is particularly bad with Dave. ‘This means that the slightest noises he makes can trigger an uncomfortable feeling of anger and the need to remove myself from the situation. Ms Watson (pictured with her boyfriend, Dave Scott) says that when she hears someone chewing she feels as though she wants to strangle them . When Ms Watson has dinner with her boyfriend she has to put the television on so she can't hear him chew . ‘But luckily Dave is very supportive and always tries to eat quietly. ‘It’s such a difficult and misunderstood illness for people to understand.’ Ms Watson was forced to drop out of college after suffering years of torment from classroom noises. Misophonia literally means the hatred of sound. It is caused by a physical malfunction of the central nervous system or the brain and is an abnormal response to sound. Most sufferer's find their condition is only triggered by certain sounds. These can cause strong emotional or physical responses such as rage, crying, screaming or nausea. The most common triggers are chewing, breathing, throat clearing and sniffing. There are no cures but some patients find relief through treatments such as hypnosis, cognitive behavioural therapy or meditation. Source: Misophonia Association . She said: ‘The class was so quiet that I picked up on every little sound, the tapping of a pen or someone chewing gum would drive me crazy. ‘I would leave college crying every day - I had no choice but to quit.’ Ms Watson’s confidence plummeted as misophonia started to dominate her life and the choices she made where dominated by her condition. She said: ‘My doctor didn’t know what misophonia was, so I wasn’t diagnosed until I was 18 years old.’ Ms Watson was put on antidepressants because she felt so low and was experiencing crippling anxiety. Then, when she thought things couldn’t get any worse, her mother, Helen, 52, died suddenly from undiagnosed diverticulitis – a digestive condition of the large intestine. Ms Watson said: ‘Me and my mum were so close, when I look back at what I’ve been through I’m lucky to have got through it. ‘My mum always said I should have been a model but I never had the confidence to try it. ‘But, before I met Dave I managed to . self-diagnose myself online with misophonia - with a doctor finally . confirming it, I have been able to get on with my life.’ Ms Watson said: 'Certain noises make me feel like strangling someone and I have different triggers for certain people making it hard to control' Ms Watson was not diagnosed with misophonia until she was 18 but she says she now has the confidence to follow her dream of trying to become a model . Finally, Ms Watson has gained the confidence to fulfil her mother’s wish and her own dreams to become a model. She has now built up a portfolio and is hoping for a successful career.

"Donald Sterling is expected to make a 'last-ditch' bid to remain in the NBA as officials gather today to discuss his expulsion from the sport. The disgraced LA Clippers owner is set launch a stiff legal challenge to NBA Commissioner Adam Silver's vow to force him to sell the team. Mr Silver has already banned Sterling from the NBA for life and imposed a maximum $2.5million fine in response to alleged racist remarks about black players. Scroll down for video . Legal battle: LA Clippers owner Donald Sterling, left, has reportedly instructed his long-time attorney Robert Platt, right, to fight moves by the NBA to force him to sell up over the racism scandal which has engulfed him . The scandal broke over the weekend when a celebrity news website released audio allegedly of Sterling criticising an ex-girlfriend for associating with 'black people', including stars such as Earvin 'Magic' Johnson. Now a source tells the New York Post that Sterling has instructed his long-time attorney Robert Platt to fight the NBA's moves to excise him from the sport. Mr Platt previously successfully defended Sterling against an lawsuit claiming racial discrimination brought by the Clippers' general manager Elgin Baylor in 2009. The unnamed source told NY Post reporters Fred Kerber and Josh Kosman: 'I think it will be one last-ditch effort for both billionaire Sterling and millionaire Platt.' Swift action: NBA Commissioner Adam Silver speaks during a press conference in New York City where he announced that the NBA is banning Sterling from the sport for life over the alleged racist remarks . The move comes ahead of a first . meeting of the advisory finance committee of the NBA board today, which . will review the next steps in forcing Sterling to sell the Clippers. Two . of the league's 29 other team owners, including the governing board's . chairman, have already said they expected to reach the three-quarters . majority vote needed to expel Sterling fully, a move unprecedented in . NBA history. According to . NBA bylaws, Mr Silver must present Sterling with a written copy of any . allegations within three days, and Sterling would have five days to . answer. A special hearing of . the Board of Governors, consisting of all the owners, would then be . held on a date no more than 10 days after Sterling's reply. But it now seems that Sterling, who bought the Clippers in 1981 for $13 million when the team was based in San Diego, will not go without a fight. If owners vote against him, is seems likely that he would seek a temporary restraining order which could lead to an injunction that would keep the case in court for years. Glamorous: The taped conversation is said to have recorded remarks made by Sterling to Vanessa Stiviano, a model of mixed African American and Mexican heritage with whom he has often been seen . Sterling was stripped of his seat on . the board as part of the lifetime ban for the 'deeply offensive and . harmful' racial views he was said to have expressed in audio recordings . released over the weekend. Neither . Sterling nor his representatives have commented on the tapes, in which a . voice said to be his is heard criticising a female friend for . 'associating with black people.' The . female friend was said to be Vanessa Stiviano, a 31-year-old model of . mixed African American and Mexican heritage who has often been seen by . Sterling's side. She has denied being the source of the recording. Ms Stiviano rollerskating: She has denied being the source of the recordings, which emerged at the weekend . Centre of attention: News of the recordings drew outrage from players, fans, politicians - including President Barack Obama - and sponsors, several of whom said they were cutting ties with the team . Mr Silver said on Tuesday that Sterling has acknowledged to the NBA that the recording was authentic but did not apologise for the remarks. News of the recordings drew outrage from players, fans, politicians - including President Barack Obama - and sponsors, several of whom said they were cutting ties with the team, even after the NBA moved to remove Sterling. The ban imposed on Tuesday prohibits Sterling from any ties with the Clippers organisation or the league as a whole and bars him from ever again attending NBA games or practices. Sterling, the longest-tenured of the NBA's 30 owners, also was excluded from any team business or player personnel decisions and was fined $2.5 million, the league's maximum monetary penalty. Asked whether Sterling, 80, could end up an absentee owner if the governing board declined to force a team sale, Mr Silver said: 'I fully expect to get the support I need from the other NBA owners to remove him.'","Donald Sterling has attorney Robert Platt to fight NBA's moves .

"It is still thought of as a chance . for women to show off their good taste in fashion. So more than a few . racegoers got the needle yesterday when Emily Wood turned up for Ladies’ Day at Epsom sporting all-over tattoos. While . other women donned expensive gowns and chic headwear, Mrs Wood, 25, . also wore a very short skirt, 6in platform shoes and facial piercings. But she was allowed in to the venue because her risqué look did not . break the dress code. In . contrast to Royal Ascot, which requires female racegoers to wear formal . attire and a hat, Epsom – where the Derby will be run today – is less . strict. However, Mrs Wood – . who attended the Derby festival meeting with husband David, 40, and . friends – may have had a motive for showing off her body art. The . former pupil at £14,000-a-year Sutton High School owns a local tattoo . parlour, where her clients include several famous footballers. Tattoos . have been increasingly on show at Ladies’ Days in recent years, sparking . a debate over whether they lower the tone. Wendy . Farrow, 50, a sales assistant from South London, said: ‘I don’t like . these tattoos at Epsom. It spoils people’s outfits and looks a bit . cheap. I’ve been coming here for ten years and I remember it used to be a . more pleasant experience. ‘A lot of girls are getting drunk and being sick in the toilets.

"A fifth of British office workers are so tied they have dozed off at their desks, a new study has revealed. The poll of sleepy staff found that a third of those quizzed had taken a nap at work due to an afternoon energy slump, with one in five actually falling asleep at their desks. Around one in five, or 22 per cent of the 2,000 UK office staff polled, have snoozed for between ten minutes and an hour - with most people napping for 47 minutes and Wednesday being the day these workers are most likely to nod off in the office. Sleeping on the job: The poll of sleepy staff found that a third of those quizzed had taken a nap at work due to an afternoon energy slump, with one in five actually falling asleep at their desks . The research was carried out by energy drink Lucozade Revive, who noted that a sneaky one in ten admitted to falling asleep in a meeting room or an office bathroom. However, 18 per cent had not even made it that far and had simply crashed out at their desks. And it appears workers’ happy moods helps colleagues stay awake, with 52 per cent of those surveyed saying that ‘working with cheerful colleagues’ helps them fight fatigue in the office, and more than a third (38 per cent) of those who nap at work confessing they do so because they hate their job. When it comes to sleeping on the job it . is women who are the biggest culprits, with 70 per cent saying they . experience an afternoon slump at least once a week, compared to just 58 . per cent of men. Tiredness: When it comes to sleeping on the job it is women who are the biggest culprits, with 70 per cent saying the experience an afternoon slump at least once a week . Almost two thirds (63 per cent) of media and advertising workers blame a ‘heavy lunch’ for their afternoon fatigue, and a third (33 per cent) blame boozing the night before as the reason why they fall asleep at work. An overwhelming 91 per cent of people working in accountancy and financial services said they experience an afternoon lull. Regular afternoon dips in energy equate to an average of 24 unproductive days a year for each UK office worker - equating to almost a tenth of the average worker’s annual salary. Adam Harris, an office worker from Portsmouth, Hampshire, has felt so tired that he found himself nodding off at work. The 28-year-old father of one said: 'With a young baby I can get extremely tired after lunch, particularly midweek. 'I have sneaked off to a corner in the staff room for a quick power nap, but once I actually nodded off at my desk.' Oliver Gray, an expert in employee wellbeing and energy, said: 'This research shows that struggling to stay awake at work is becoming part of modern life. 'People need to manage their energy better and think about their diet, physical activity and lifestyle. 'Instead of unhealthy snack like crisps, cake and chocolate, they should look for products containing energy releasing B vitamins because they help unlock and release the energy in the food you eat.'","2,000 UK office staff took part in survey by energy drink Lucozade Revive .

"A list of billionaires, bankers and lobbyists who received £12,000-a-table access to David Cameron and other senior Cabinet ministers was published for the first time last night. The documents revealed that almost 450 attendees at last summer’s glittering Tory fundraising dinner had a combined wealth of more than £11billion. They sat at tables costing up to £12,000 each alongside Mr Cameron, Home Secretary Theresa May, Defence Secretary Philip Hammond and London Mayor Boris Johnson. Known as the 'homeless billionaire', Nicolas Berggruen is famous for not having a home despite his vast wealth. The 52-year-old founder and president of Berggruen Holdings, a private investment company, was seated very near to the Prime Minister at last summer's glittering Tory fundraising dinner . It is not known how much was raised from the 2013 event, but Electoral Commission figures show that since the ball, those present have donated £5million to the Conservatives. Of this, £1.1million was registered in the week after the event. Table sales raised at least £250,000, with cheaper tickets going for £400. The guest list for the private event last summer at Old Billingsgate Market in Central London included six billionaires and 15 people with a personal wealth above £100million. Documents seen by the Bureau of Investigative Journalism showed there were 73 financiers, 47 retail and property tycoons, ten people in oil, gas and mining and 19 attendees working in public affairs and PR. One guest was Vladimir Putin’s judo partner Vasily Shestakov, who was introduced to the Prime Minister. The Russian president’s aide had the job of improving Russia’s reputation in the UK. The revelation will give further ammunition to Labour, which wants to paint the Conservatives as the party of the rich. The Tory fundraising dinner is an annual event and this year’s will be held next Wednesday at the Hurlingham private members’ club in West London. The main sponsor was Shore Capital, an investment bank led by Howard Shore, who has donated £450,000 to the Conservatives personally and through his companies. The documents revealed that almost 450 attendees at last summer's even at Old Billingsgate Fish Market had a combined wealth of more than £11billion . They sat at tables costing up to £12,000 each alongside David Cameron, Home Secretary Theresa May, Defence Secretary Philip Hammond and London Mayor Boris Johnson . He booked three ‘premier tables’ and on one hosted David and Samantha Cameron. The table also included investor Nicolas Berggruen, Slovenian tycoon Darko Horvat and property magnate Sir John Ritblat. Mr Shore’s company told The Guardian: ‘Shore Capital supported the event and made a financial contribution, as they believe that the Conservative Party, led by the Prime Minister, are the best party to govern the country.’ Alistair Graham, the former chairman of the Committee on Standards in Public Life, said: ‘These events are not transparent at all. ‘They are made to be private, cosy affairs where you pay for attention from a senior political figure and if you are seeking to influence the government you might have the opportunity to do so. ‘We are vulnerable as a country to people getting private access to ministers for not too much money.’ A Tory spokesman said: ‘All donations to the Conservative Party are properly and transparently declared to the Electoral Commission, published by them, and  comply fully with Electoral Commission rules.’ Mr Johnson shared a table with Andrei Borodin, an exiled Russian banker who is wanted by the Kremlin to face charges of ‘aggravated swindling’ over an alleged £220million bank fraud. Mrs May was placed with Lord De La Warr, director of Cluff Natural Resources which is exploring a process called coal gasification in Warwickshire. Mr Hammond shared a table with the Saudi Arabian head of the Arab British Chamber of Commerce, Afnan Al-Shuaiby, and the table was paid for by Lord Clanwilliam, a PR adviser who works for the government of Bahrain, which has faced criticism of its human rights record. Paul Staines, who runs the Guido Fawkes website, was sat at a table with Sir Michael Hintze, a top Tory donor and manager of hedge fund CQS. Communities Secretary Eric Pickles shared a table with nightclub owner Peter Stringfellow. Sir Michael has donated £3,181,473 to the Tories, while Mr Shore has given £499,330 and Mr Stringfellow  £39,340. Jon Ashworth, Labour’s spokesman for the Cabinet Office, said: ‘These reports further lift the lid on a Party which is bankrolled by and stands up for a privileged few. ‘The Tories did all they could to keep this list secret and now we know why. It shows a party reliant on a select group of super-rich donors – the same group who’ve been given a tax cut by David Cameron’s Government while everyone else pays more.’","Almost 450 attendees at last summer’s glittering Tory fundraising dinner .

"Foreign television fans are enjoying BBC programmes for almost a third of the price charged to UK licence fee payers. Millions of people across Europe, Australia and Canada are watching the best of the BBC for as little as £52 a year, or £4.33 a month. An annual pass for thousands of hours of drama, comedy and documentaries is available for just £52, compared to the £145.50 licence fee paid by Britons at home. For as little as £4 a month people overseas can access BBC iPlayer online while UK residents are forced to pay £145 for a licence fee whether they watch the channel or not . And overseas users get access to a vast vault of priceless BBC archive material unavailable to British viewers. The disparity last night led to calls for the broadcaster to use the money to reduce the licence fee. Tory MP Conor Burns, a member of the Commons culture, media and sport select committee, said the profits should be used to save domestic viewers money. He added: ‘I am very much in favour of the BBC commercialising content and using the revenue to create more innovative, good quality British-made productions. But it is an outrage that  they are selling content to  foreign nationals at a cheaper rate than to those in the UK who are obliged to pay the licence fee. ‘The licence fee is a poll tax. People in Britain, if they have a TV, have no choice, whether they watch the BBC or not.’ The BBC is quietly expanding the availability of the internet-based Global iPlayer – which is not available in the UK – after launching a ‘pilot’ more than two years ago. It can be accessed across Western Europe, as well as in Australia and Canada. European subscribers pay €7.99 a month (£6.70) or €74.99 euros a year (£63), which works out at £5.25 a month. In Australia the annual cost is even cheaper at 89.99 Australian dollars (£52.50) while in Canada access costs just 84.99 (£52) Canadian dollars – £4.33 a month. The BBC is quietly expanding the availability of the internet-based Global iPlayer ¿ which is not available in the UK ¿ after launching a ¿pilot¿ more than two years ago. For this, viewers can access 2,000 hours of shows on demand via their iPad or iPhone. The Global iPlayer also offers the back catalogues of landmark comedies such as Blackadder and Fawlty Towers. One Canadian viewer wrote: ‘At last decent programming! Canadian Dollars 85 for a year is NOTHING for what you get to see or listen to.’ Foreign viewers are not offered live streamed content, radio or an identical catch-up service to that which is available in Britain. But the vast majority of  BBC radio programmes can be accessed through the internet anywhere in the world. Last year, BBC Worldwide, which is behind the move, revealed the iPlayer has already been downloaded over a million times overseas. The Global iPlayer is only available through the iTunes ‘app store’ which means, as with all other services, 30 per cent of all revenue is handed to US tech giant Apple. Just last month the BBC revealed a record number of domestic households are watching programmes online, fuelling fears they are legally dodging the licence fee. It is thought many viewers who use the iPlayer service do not own televisions, meaning they are not required to pay the licence fee. A TV licence is required for viewing programmes online only when broadcast in their scheduled slots or streamed live, as in the case of events such as Wimbledon. A BBC spokesman said; ‘Unlike the UK BBC iPlayer, the Global iPlayer is not a seven-day catch-up service, and it does not offer the same breadth or amount of content available to the UK licence fee payer. Profits generated by BBC Worldwide are returned to the BBC for the ultimate benefit of the licence fee payer.’","Millions abroad have cheap access to shows which cost UK viewers £145.50 .

"The Australian Defence Force is facing claims that one of their leading battalions paid topless barmaids to entertain soldiers and junior officers at an 'Oktoberfest' event, resulting in the demotion of a corporal. It is alleged that four civilian women were paid to remove their clothes, despite direct orders being handed down from the commanding officer of the 2nd Battalion of the Royal Australian Regiment to avoid such behaviour, The Australian reports. The battalion, currently based at Lavarack Barracks in Townsville, Queensland, was first formed in 1945 and has deployed to significant Australian engagements including the occupation of Japan, the Korean War, the Malayan Emergency and the Vietnam War. The 'Oktoberfest' event was held for over 100 soldiers and junior officers from the 2nd Battalion on September 26, during which a roast pig and $6000 worth of alcohol was served at a venue known as 'The Booza'.

A status posted the day after the event on the Battalion's Facebook page '2 RAR Pipes and Drums', said 'The Pig carcass destroyed. Two cartons left out of the 6G we spent on booze. One fat lip. One possible demotion. BUT ONE HELL OF A NIGHT!'. One of the members of the page commented 'You wouldn't have it any other way'. The event was held at 'The Booza', Edgar Towner Victoria Cross Club at the battalion's Lavarack Barracks, where only serving members of the rank of Corporal or below are permitted. The Australian reported that the battalion advertised for 'bar girls' for the event, but there was no indication that the women would be asked to remove their clothes. A military spokesman said that specific instructions were given for the women to be fully clothed throughout the event. 'In this instance, and prior to the function, both written and verbal orders were given directing that bar staff were to assist in the service of food and beverages only and were to remain fully clothed at all times,' the spokesman said. The women were allegedly freelance workers recommended by a member of the battalion, and not from Townsville's major hostess companies. The description on the event page for the 'Oktoberfest' event . The post on the battalion's Facebook page the day after the event . The Facebook page has a picture of a nearly naked woman removing her underwear with the caption, 'Oh you're an infantryman?

The incident was reported to the battalion's senior commanding officer after the event. The corporal responsible for organising the event was allegedly found to have breached direct orders by the commanding officer Lieutenant Colonel Michael Bassingthwaighte and stripped of his rank and sentenced to 14 days detention, reported The Australian. Upon release the corporal lodged a petition against the demotion, and a review into the incident ruled that the Lieutenant could not objectively pass judgement on a charge of flouting his own orders. The corporal was reinstated and the sentence brought against him was removed. 'The issues regarding the legal advice provided...are now a matter from training and professional development,' said the military spokesman.

The ADF has been plagued with a spate of sexual scandals in recent years, including the release of pictures showing soldiers from the Special Air Service Regiment barracks in Swanbourne, Western Australia in the company of topless barmaids employed by a government-owned bar. Defence banned the barmaids from attending the Gratwick Club which is located next to the Special Air Service Regiment barracks in Swanbourne, Western Australia, the Sydney Morning Herald reported. The photos, which appeared on ninemsn, show soldiers in the company of topless women, one of whom is tattooed and blonde. Another photo shows a brunette woman with pink nail polish holding up a peace sign in the foreground of a photo, with uniformed soldiers pictured sitting at tables in the background. The mother of a former special forces soldier, who uncovered the photos, claims her son has been mistreated over his sexuality. Recently ABC TV's Four Corners program aired fresh stories from four former female cadets who claim to have been raped, sexually assaulted or denigrated while at ADFA in the 1990s and 2009. The women criticised the military's response to abuse claims - the Defence Abuse Response Taskforce - as inadequate. They have also been joined by former Australian Defence Force magistrate Ken Northwood, Palmer United Party senator Jacqui Lambie and lawyer Gary Rumble - who led a review into ADFA abuse allegations - in calling for a royal commission to fully uncover the extent of abuse and hold the perpetrators to account. The Defence Abuse Response Taskforce is still responding to claims.","The 2nd Battalion of the Royal Australian Regiment allegedly paid women to remove their clothes at an annual 'Oktoberfest' event for the troops .

"She's mothered orphaned elephants, helped create Kenya's mighty Tsavo National Park and has spent years railing against poaching: Life, for Dame Daphne Sheldrick, has certainly been interesting. Now the veteran conservationist, who turns 80 tomorrow, has opened up for the first time on the moments that have made her life among the elephants so magical, although not all concern pachyderms. 'A much treasured bond was . with a Thompson gazelle who we named Geri,' reveals Dame Daphne, who still lives near the Kenyan capital Nairobi, in an exclusive interview with MailOnline. Scroll down for video . Tea for two: Baby elephant Aisha snuggles up to Daphne as she attempts to pour herself a cup of tea . Adorable: Daphne relaxes outside her home with an orphaned rhino calf (left) and a baby buffalo (right) 'She was . rescued from the . Kitengela plains, just outside of Nairobi, when her mother was killed . for bush meat.' Geri, who spent her early months being hand-raised in . Daphne's daughter Angela's home, eventually became a loving pet. But . tragedy almost struck when the little gazelle was grabbed by a lioness . while sitting on a daybed on Angela's veranda. 'Angela who immediately . took off down the . hill after the lioness, who had Geri in her mouth,' remembers Daphne. 'She was screaming like a banshee, which proved too much for the pride so they abandoned their . kill but not before Geri was quite literally shredded. 'It . never occurred to me that Geri would . ever be able to recover from this encounter but she was rushed to the . vet and was stitched up, with my 15-year-old grandson Taru, the person . she loved the most, with her. 'Over the following weeks and months though, with . tender loving care from everyone, Geri came back to life, and eventually . made a full recovery. It was her unwavering love and loyalty to the . family that was so humbling.' But . little Geri isn't the only animal Daphne and Angela have taken into . their homes and hearts over the years. From gazelles to elephants and . even rhinos, all have been welcomed into Daphne's life, with many later . finding permanent homes in the 9,000sqkm Tsavo National Park, which was . founded in the 1960s with the help of Daphne and her husband David.

Firm . friends: Daphne and baby Aisha relax on a sand dune in Tsavo National . Park, the Kenyan wildlife reserve that Daphne and her husband David . helped found . The existence of the park remains one of Daphne's proudest achievements. 'I had rewarding life with . David, my late husband,' she remembers. 'Building Tsavo National Park together from . virgin bush over so many years was extremely special. 'But seeing my children and grandchildren's love for the natural world and their commitment . to the David Sheldrake Wildlife Trust and the work we do is the most rewarding - knowing that the . legacy of all we have worked towards will continue long after I am gone.' Sadly . for Daphne and her family, their work is becoming more intense than . ever before, largely as a result of increased poaching driven by the . demand for rhino horn and ivory from China and the Far East. 'Bite . your finger nails - it’s the same . stuff,' fumes Daphne.

"Spoken out: Jo Swinson, Lib Dem business minister who gave birth before Christmas, is calling for a change . MPs with newborn babies should be able to bring them into the House of Commons for votes because they would not be a disruption, a minister has claimed. Jo Swinson, the Liberal Democrat business minister who gave birth to a boy before Christmas, said the ban on bringing infants to the voting lobby was ‘bizarre’. A parliamentarian who is breastfeeding may bring a baby into their own office, but not into the House of Commons or House of Lords chambers, or the division lobbies they pass through to vote. Miss Swinson, who is married to fellow Lib Dem MP Duncan Hames, suggested the rules were archaic, saying: ‘I hardly think it would be too much of a disruption. You can take a sword through there but you can’t a baby.’ No one other than an MP is allowed through the voting lobby – even a baby. A special exception was made for David Blunkett’s guide dog, Sadie. While she is on maternity leave, Miss Swinson, 33, does not get a replacement. Her office staff will look after her constituents in East Dunbartonshire and Lib Dem colleague Jenny Willott will perform her ministerial duties. In her last interview before going on maternity leave, Miss Swinson said she had a ‘huge amount of support and goodwill’ from colleagues in parliament during her pregnancy, but said: ‘I think some of the structures of the institutions of the House of Commons probably don’t make it as easy as it could be, in particular that you don’t get maternity cover.’ Miss Willott, who gave birth in 2010, complained at the time that when she took her son Toby for late votes, often called at just a few minutes’ notice, she had to hand him ‘to the nearest MP’ who had already voted, and that this happened ‘a couple of times a week’. Miss Swinson said: ‘I don’t think it’s . impossible or insurmountable but I don’t think there’s any job that’s . particularly easy to have a baby when you’re in it. Family values: Swinson, here pictured with husband, fellow Lib Dem MP Duncan Hames, and baby Andrew . 'There’s always going to be a lot of challenges and there’s plenty of people who have jobs with even more difficult challenges, like people who are self-employed and running a business. ‘There has been a change that women who are breastfeeding can be nodded through. 'But I think when you are perfectly capable of walking through the lobby holding a small baby, I think there would be a better way of just allowing that. But parliament moves but slowly.’ Miss Swinson announced the birth of her son on Twitter on Christmas Eve. She wrote: ‘Duncan & I delighted to welcome our son Andrew Lennox Marshall Hames to the world on Sun 22 Dec, weight 7lb 10oz, all tired but v.happy!’. The MP, here with Nick Clegg, calls the policy a hangover of the 'guilt culture' of women working . Mr Hames has given up his role as an aide to leader Nick Clegg to spend more time with his son. Miss Swinson, also responsible for equalities, said new parents should do what instinctively feels right and not worry if they follow official guidance to the letter. She said: ‘I think we need to get away from this guilt culture in terms of judging other people’s decisions as parents.’ Employers must carry out a risk assessment to establish whether pregnant or breastfeeding  women can continue to work. If they can, the employers have a legal obligation to provide suitable rest facilities. Parliament  has a creche for MPs, peers and staff which is usually open until 6pm. In 2000, a bid to allow breastfeeding in the Commons was blocked by the then Speaker Betty Boothroyd.","Lib Dem Business Minister urged move away from 'guilt culture'

"A washed up former professional footballer who masqueraded as a Premier League star to maintain his celebrity life of champagne and shopping sprees is facing a 'substantial' stretch in jail for fraud today. Medi Abalimba, 24, who once earned £4,000 a week and was tipped for stardom, was so ashamed at his career at top flight clubs floundering due to injury he falsely claimed to be multi-millionaire Chelsea midfielder Gael Kakuta to get drink and clothes on credit. During one incident he duped starstruck staff into running up a £25,000 bar tab on Cristal champagne in one West End Club in London claiming 'he was a Premier League star and good for the money'. He also ran up a £9,600 bill at three London luxury hotels, took a bar in Manchester for another £5,000, scrounged suites in luxury apartment complexes and spent £11,000 on limousines saying he had an American Express credit card. Scroll down for video . Medi Abalimba (left), the conman who posed as Chelsea footballer Gael Kakuta (right)  to enjoy a champagne lifestyle in luxury hotels . Medi Abalimba duped staff at the Cirque du Soir burlesque club in Soho into giving him champagne after convincing them he had put his credit card behind the bar . Abalimba was caught after he attempted to buy clothing worth more than £20,000 from a store at the Trafford Centre near Manchester on a dodgy credit card only for staff to become suspicious and retain the items. He claimed his one-time massive weekly wage left him with a 'wholly unrealistic' understanding of money. Today at Manchester Crown Court, Abalimba, of Kings Cross, London, admitted three charges of fraud, taking a Range Rover without consent and making off without paying for £104 worth of petrol. Nearly all the offences involved him making false representations that he was Gael Kakuta. He was also appearing for sentence for five other counts of similar frauds in London and Derby in which he claimed to be the former Chelsea star. He asked for 19 other offences to be considered. Judge Robert Atherton agreed to an adjournment until later this month for the preparation of background reports but said: 'How will a pre-sentence report assist me in a case which will inevitably be a substantial prison sentence? I'm not planning a non-custodial sentence.' Abalimba, was born in the Congo and had begun his career as a midfielder in the youth teams of Crystal Palace and Fulham, before moving to Southend United where he was paid £1,000 a week at just 16 years old. He attracted attention from several Premier League clubs early in his career and was given trials at Manchester United and Manchester City. At Liverpool, he played for the reserves while the then manager Rafa Benitez watched from the stands and eventually signed for Derby County in 2009 for £1.2million. Abalimba was arrested again in July after he posed as Kakuta to buy clothing worth more than £20,000 from a store in the Trafford Centre near Manchester . He was paid £4,000 a week and received an appearance fee of £1,000 as a substitute, and £2,000 for starting a match. But his career was curtailed by injury and he was sent to Oldham Athletic on a free transfer in January 2011 having failed to make a competitive appearance. In August 2012 he was signed by Farnborough Town with a wage of just £300 a week and was forced to supplement his income with part-time work as a taxi firm controller. Fearing his friends would dump him, he took them for a night out in London where he duped staff at the Cirque du Soir burlesque club in Soho into giving him champagne after convincing them he had put his credit card behind the bar. When a waiter could not find the card, Abalimba said he was a Premier League footballer and was 'good for the money' by showing photos of himself posing in football shirts with Premier League stars. He then racked up the five-figure bar tab entertaining a table of 10 guests, buying bottles of champagne which cost up to £5,000 each - even offering to buy bubbly for a man at the next table. In all he ordered two jeroboams of Cristal, each equivalent to four regular bottles, and used a microphone to invite the entire club back to his house for a party. Born: October 4, 1992 . Position: Midfielder . Played for: Youth teams of Crystal Palace and Fulham, Southend United, Liverpool reserves, Derby County, Oldham Athletic and Farnborough Town . Earnings: £4,000 a week at Derby, £300 a week at Farnborough Town . Highest transfer fee: £1.2million . Born: June 21, 1991 . Position: Striker . Played for: Premier League clubs such as Chelsea, Fulham, Bolton, French side Dijon, Vitesse in Holland, Lazio in Italy and Rayo Vallecano in Spain . Earnings: Currently an estimated £1million a year at La Liga club Rayo Vallecano . Highest transfer fee:  £3.96 million . At the end of the night, it was discovered he could not pay the bill and police arrived to arrest him. At the time he claimed he had been given a credit card by his French football club but the court heard Abalimba had caused the waiter to become a laughing stock across London's nightlife. He appeared at Southwark Crown Court in February 2013 when his barrister Sean Caulfield claimed his client had a 'dramatic fall from grace' which his friends knew nothing about, adding: 'It's not that he was going somewhere he had never been before. It's the reverse - he was trying to live up to the expectations that his friends had of him.' He told the court that Abalimba's career as a professional football player had left him with a 'wholly unrealistic' understanding of money and added: 'There is some background to this, which may explain why Abalimba thinks it normal behaviour to go to a nightclub and spend such sums. 'It would appear that perhaps his understanding of adult life and finance was wholly unrealistic.' At the time Abalimba was given a six-month suspended sentence, ordered to carry out 150 hours' unpaid work and banned from entering West End nightclubs for a year. But he was arrested again in July after he posed as Kakuta to buy clothing worth more than £20,000 from a Trafford Centre store. But he flouted the suspended sentence on the weekend of Saturday 14 and Sunday 15 June 2014, when a man purporting to be a Premier League footballer ran up a tab of about £5,000 at the city centre venue. The bill was paid for using compromised credit card details. He had also booked into the five-star Mandarin Oriental hotel in Hyde Park, after pretending to be Kakuta's agent but was subsequently caught by police after they found his fingerprints on a pair of Harvey Nichols shoes the fraudster had attempted to give out as a tip. He had also racked up a £9,600 tab at Corinthia in Whitehall and the Millennium Knightsbridge. He has previous convictions for burglary, going equipped for theft and shoplifting. Kakuta is now on his sixth loan spell away from Chelsea after agreeing a move to Rayo Vallecano in the summer. The 23-year-old has now been shipped out to Fulham, Bolton, Dijon, Vitesse and Lazio before heading to Spain.","Medi Abalimba, 24, claimed he was Chelsea midfielder Gael Kakuta .

"Husbands who constantly criticise their wives over their weight or appearance may be guilty of domestic abuse, a Labour frontbencher has suggested. Seema Malhotra, Labour’s new shadow anti domestic violence minister, said such abuse could be part of a wider pattern of ‘controlling behaviour’ which can be as bad as a physical attack. She said: ‘It can be part of a pattern of controlling behaviour that leaves people feeling fearful and terrorised in their own homes.’ Scroll down for video . Seema Malhotra, the MP for Feltham and Heston, said criticising a partner's appearance could be part of a wider pattern of abuse . Ms Malhotra said repeatedly criticising a woman’s appearance could be seen as an ‘indicator of physical abuse in the future’. She told MailOnline that one woman she spoke to had been forced to flee her home after her husband attempted to control her entire life. But she said it started with him criticising her appearance. The Labour MP said: ‘She felt traumatised. For this woman her journey – her nightmare – started out with him making these comments about her appearance and progressed to wanting to control what she looked like and where she went until he had total control over her.’ Nicky Morgan has responsibility for countering domestic violence in the Cabinet . Ms Malhotra said she was not talking about arguments between couples or snide remarks made in anger, but a wider pattern of behaviour which leads to abuse. She told the Times that that domestic abuse ‘affects women and men of all backgrounds — rich and poor, white and black and ethnic minority’ and needed to be tackled. But she said it was often misunderstood. Ms Malhotra, who entered the Commons in 2011 after winning a by-election in the London seat of Feltham and Heston, said that victims were often let down by police. She said there are women ‘who spend their lives not just recovering from the trauma of having survived domestic violence but then are left on the run, picking up the pieces and trying to protect their children’. She said figures showed there were 12 million women and 2.5 million men that had been the victims of domestic abuse – but the number of prosecutions was nowhere near that figure. Ms Malhotra said her new position of anti-domestic abuse spokeswoman was created because ‘victims need a greater voice at the heart of the system’. She will work on a variety of issues – including forced marriage, genital mutilation abusive porn. She said: ‘Porn is now easily available on mobile phones. Young people are accessing it who are sometimes not even in their teens.’ Such images were often violent and offered unhealthy portrayals of sex and relationships, she said. Ms Malhotra also revealed that Labour would introduce mandatory sex education in all state schools.","Claim made by Seema Malhotra, Labour’s anti domestic violence spokesman .

"A staunch campaign is underway to find a family's beloved border terrier called Toby, who was dog napped just over two weeks ago. The devastated Marsh family from Surrey has staged a re-enactment of the dog-kidnapping in the hope that someone will come forward with information about their cherished pet's whereabouts. Owner Lousie Marsh, a veterinary surgeon, has set up a ‘Find Toby Terrier’ Twitter profile, which has over 1,500 followers, and a Facebook page with more than  1,400 'likes'. Reenactment shows a Toby lookalike being passed through the window of a silver estate car . Animal Search UK has been drafted in to try and help find the terrier and a £1,000 reward offered . The campaign has captured the nation and messages from @FindTobyTerrier profile have been retweeted by celebrities such as Andy Murray, Will Young and Lorraine Kelly and Border terrier owners including Dermot O'Leary, Keith Lemon, and David Walliams. Louise believes Toby must have slipped out of the front door when she went to fetch something from the car during the afternoon on 10 October. Once she noticed he was missing she  began door-to-door inquires. Louise  met a boy who said he had caught Toby and put him on a lead. The boy had been asking a few houses whether anyone knew who the dog belonged to when he was approached by a man who volunteered to drive Toby to the vet to scan him for a microchip. The boy gave him the dog in good faith, but Toby has not been seen since. The man who took Toby is described as between 40 and 50 years old, white, with a bald or shaved head. He was driving a silver estate car and had a young boy  in the front. At the time of the suspected dog-napping, Toby was wearing a green suede collar with a silver buckle and is micro chipped. Since then, Louise has called in Animal Search UK to investigate. She’s been distributing leaflets  and putting up posters. Articles have appeared in local papers and the story has been broadcast on local radio and Jeremy Vine’s Radio 2 show. Not giving up: Owner Louise Marsh is devastated and hopes the  campaign will help locateToby . Toby was especially close to Louise’s six-month-old daughter, Pippa, and Peggy, the Marsh's three-legged crossbreed rescue dog, who is now pining for the terrier. ‘Toby has been fixated on the baby since she arrived and was never far from her side,’ says Louise. ‘When he heard her crying he would run to both me and my husband to double check we were coming.’ Now Peggy is not eating and refuses to go out. ‘Toby has been a companion for Peggy and they always slept together curled up in a ball.’ ‘Toby is very much a part of our family, we call him our 'first born'. We have been blown away by the support to find him so far.’ A £1,000 reward has been offered to anyone who can help locate Toby.

"The main representative body of British Jews has called Wigan chairman Dave Whelan's comments 'outrageous' and labelled his apology as 'half-hearted'. Whelan is set to face a Football Association charge after he responded to the controversy over Wigan's appointment of Malky Mackay as manager by telling the Guardian: 'I think Jewish people do chase money more than everybody else.' The Wigan owner has since apologised for any offence caused but is facing a critical situation at the club. One of the Latics' shirt sponsors, kitchen firm Premier Range, announced it was breaking ties with the club due to Whelan's appointment of Mackay, who is himself the subject of an FA investigation for sending allegedly racist text messages to Iain Moody, his former head of recruitment at Cardiff.

"Prostate cancer patients are receiving ‘second rate’ care on the NHS compared to women with breast cancer, a report warns. They are far less likely to be offered the latest drugs, be looked after by a specialist nurse, or given basic pain relief. Campaigners accuse the health service of discriminating against men with prostate cancer, who tend to be more elderly than women with breast cancer. Men with prostate cancer are far less likely to be offered the latest drugs, be looked after by a specialist nurse, or given basic pain relief compared to women with breast cancer, according to a new report (posed by model) They also say Nice, the drugs rationing body, has made fewer prostate drugs available to the health service compared with those for other forms of cancer. Paul Burstow, the Liberal Democrat MP and former health minister who wrote the report with cancer charity Orchid, said there was a ‘huge, unacceptable, inexplicable variation’ in standards. He added: ‘Why should men with prostate cancer have to cope with second-rate services, a lack of vital support and limited access to world-class drug treatments and trials?’ There are 41,700 new cases of prostate cancer in the UK each year, and one in eight men will contract the disease at some point. But the report warns that despite such high prevalence, men with the illness suffer far worse care than other cancer patients. Richard Smock was diagnosed with prostate cancer four years ago. The married 72-year-old was told the cancer had spread to his bones – and was therefore untreatable. Doctors are now giving him drugs to extend his life and help relieve symptoms, but he is not expected to survive past the age of 75. However he has never been put in touch with a dedicated nurse – known as a clinical nurse specialist – who could offer expert care and support. The father of three, who lives in Bromley, South-East London, said: ‘I would have really appreciated having someone to talk through the basic practicalities, particularly immediately following my diagnosis.’ He added: ‘It’s easy just to focus on the physical – the first thing you discuss is exactly how long you have left – but there is so much beyond that. ‘Having a dedicated individual to help navigate through the psychological, social and financial side of cancer would have been invaluable.’ There is no obvious reason why, but the majority of patients are elderly. Meanwhile women with breast cancer, for example, tend to be younger and in better health. Mr Burstow said: ‘We do require health providers to ask, “Are we doing everything we can to make sure men are getting access to cancer treatments they need as much as women?” ‘It’s something the NHS England cancer tsar should be looking at.’ Despite mortality rates improving substantially thanks to earlier diagnoses, prostate cancer still kills 10,800 men annually. But figures show that only a third of men with the disease are offered the chance to take part in potentially life-saving clinical trials – which could also pave the way for new treatments for other patients. The report also says that many men with incurable cancers are not offered life-extending treatments such as Docetaxel and Abiraterone. This may be because doctors are not aware they are available – or assume they are not worthwhile. There are also just 280 specialist nurses in England for all urological cancers – which include prostate, bladder, kidney and testicular – compared to 425 for breast cancer. Some 13 per cent of prostate patients felt their care was substandard, against 10 per cent of women with breast cancer. Twenty-two per cent also felt staff did not do enough to control pain, whereas the figure was 17 per cent for breast cancer patients. In addition, far fewer prostate drugs have been approved by Nice, meaning men must rely on getting unapproved drugs from the Cancer Drugs Fund – which can only be done through an oncologist. Sean Duffy, the clinical director for cancer at NHS England, said: ‘Survival rates for prostate cancer are now very high. We are not complacent though and know we need to do much more, particularly to reduce variation in services.’","Cancer charity Orchid: Men treated worse than women with breast cancer .

"A father-of-two 'methodically' stabbed his estranged wife to death in front of their two young sons after a chance encounter. Nathaniel Brown, 27, was described as 'quiet, with a calm demeanour' as he repeatedly stabbed 24-year-old Zandra Maxwell-Nelson. Brown was today jailed for a minimum of 21 years. The victim and the killer's sister had taken their children for a picnic in a park before returning to the sister's north London home where Brown was waiting. Nathaniel Brown (left) will serve at least 21 years in prison after he fatally stabbed his ex-wife Zandra Maxwell-Nelson (right) to death last April in front of their two young children . He had not seen his wife for more than a year on the day of the killing and was not apparently aware she and his sister were friends. After 'blanking' his wife and sons, he walked inside the property and played with his sister's children. He left, but then returned claiming he need to use the toilet. It was then he grabbed a kitchen knife and calmly began knifing his former partner. There were as many as 20 stab wounds found on her body. The onslaught continued even as she desperately climbed into a parked car, before the murderer dropped the blade in the street and took off his bloodstained shirt as he walked away. Brown was convicted of murder following a two-week trial at the Old Bailey, after admitting manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility. Jailing him for life with a minimum term of 21 years, Judge Martin Stephens QC told Brown he was a 'controlling and possessive' individual who was unable to accept his wife and sister being friends. 'Nothing the court heard about you from doctors can begin to explain the savage, remitting attack you launched on a helpless woman, your wife, other than wilful anger,' the judge said. 'All this in the street, in front of your own and other people's children, and in the view of horrified neighbours. 'You were angry because your wife and sister were consorting together without your knowledge and approval. The stabbing happened outside Brown's sister house on Durban Road in Tottenham . 'The loss and suffering by your children, and your wife's mother and family, is unbearable for them. 'I'm prepared to accept you were facing personality problems throughout this time, but what you did could not be explained by mental abnormality.' He added: 'This is the minimum term you can serve before you can even be considered for release on licence, and that will only ever happen if the parole board considers you are no longer a danger to the public.' Brown, who sat in silence with his head bowed throughout the hearing and much of the trial, showed no emotion as the sentence was passed, while members of Ms Maxwell-Nelson's family yelled 'thank you' to the judge. Jurors heard the couple had wed just months after meeting in early 2007 but had not seen each other for more than a year at the time of Ms Maxwell-Nelson's death. She was killed after a chance . encounter with his victim as Mr Brown waited for his sister outside her home in . Durban Road, Tottenham, at around 6pm on April 20 last year. Following a registry office ceremony, she soon became pregnant but suffered a miscarriage, before conceiving their first child later that year. Brown was convicted of murder following a two-week trial at the Old Bailey . Just 18 days following the birth of Abraham on May 14, 2008, the young mother left Brown alone with his newborn son while she went to the toilet in the middle of the night. She returned five minutes later to find the infant's eye was bloodshot, with Brown admitting he had slapped him to stop him crying. Miss Maxwell-Nelson immediately moved out before reporting him to the police, the court heard. Months later, in breach of his bail conditions, Brown turned up at her mother's house and hurled a brick through a kitchen window after she refused to speak to him. An entry in Miss Maxwell-Nelson's diary from early 2008 also said her husband had pushed her into a hedge during a row. She later agreed to see him, becoming pregnant with their second child, before permanently breaking off contact and filing for divorce in September 2010. Describing the killing, Adrian Darbishire, prosecuting said: 'He ignored completely his wife and two young boys - he blanked them. 'The defendant went into the house, playing with his nephews and nieces, and after about 10 or 15 minutes came out of the house and walked away. 'He must have reflected on what he had seen, and after about 20 minutes he came back and told his sister he needed to use the toilet.' Brown then headed into the house and grabbed a kitchen knife before emerging seconds later and beginning the brutal attack on his former partner. 'Altogether some 15 to 20 knife wounds were found on Zandra's body, particularly on the torso but also on the arms and other parts,' said Mr Darbishire. 'He stabbed her again and again and again.' 'Eyewitnesses described the defendant as remaining quiet, with a calm demeanour throughout the attack. 'He appeared to one to be ""almost methodical"".' After handing himself in on the same day of the killing, Brown maintained that he could not remember the murder and argued at trial that he had been suffering from severe depression and narcissistic personality disorder, which affected his judgement. But a consultant psychiatrist told jurors the jobless murderer was simply 'chronically unhappy' with his life - not depressed - and his state of mind could not explain the attack. Brown, of no fixed address, denied murder, but admitted manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility.","Nathaniel Brown lay in wait for former partner who had been for picnic with their children and his sister .

"A huge security operation is underway today ahead of the clandestine Bilderberg conference starting at a five-star hotel in Hertfordshire tomorrow. Anti-capitalists are planning to descend on the secret annual meeting of the world's leading politicians, bankers, academics and business minds. It is being held at the exclusive Grove Hotel near Watford, which is now surrounded by a giant fence being guarded by police. Famous for being shrouded in secrecy, the Bilderberg conference is taking place in Britain for the first time since 1998, and conspiracy theorists believe this is where leaders plot world domination. Scroll down for full Bilderberg Conference guest list and video... Luxurious: The secretive conference will take place at the five-star Grove Hotel near Watford, Hertfordshire (pictured) and a major police security operation has started today, which includes adding fencing . Preparations: Police were seen  doing security checks in bushes outside the hotel and checking the perimeter . Chancellor George Osborne and his Labour counterpart Ed Balls will be there along with Amazon's Jeff Bezos and Eric Schmidt of Google. But delegates never reveal exactly what is discussed, but it will involve the key issues these leaders believe the world faces. There is already a heavy police presence . in the area because of the fears that the three-day meeting may be . disrupted by anti-Globilisation protesters. Extra fencing was erected in . the grounds and footpaths were being closed. The Grove Hotel, which is set in 300 acres or parkland, is close to the M25, the River Gade and the Grand Union Canal. Guest list: Chancellor George Osborne and his Labour shadow Ed Balls will attend the Bilderberg Conference . Delegates will be spending three days . with the heads of global corporations such as Google, Amazon, Goldman . Sachs and BAE Systems as well as other leading figures such as Christine . Lagarde, head of the IMF, and former US secretary of state, Henry . Kissinger. They are among the . 140 people, including only 14 women - . who will this week discuss topics such as ‘cyber warfare’ and ‘jobs, . entitlement and debt’. Dorothy Thornhill, the Mayor of . Watford has written to the Prime Minister voicing concern about cost of . the security operation will have on Hertfordshire's police budget . Hertfordshire Police said the . Bilderberg Group had made a donation to the policing costs of the . conference, but would not say how much. Given the amount of prestigious names . set to attend the event at the luxury hotel, local police have been . forced to step up security, which will be part-funded by the government. As a result, there are fears that anti-capitalist protesters will cause ‘violence and disturbance’. Also attending: Jeff Bezos (left) and Eric Schmidt (right) of Google will be at the clandestine conference . Bilderberg - which will also be . attended by former Barclays chairman Marcus Agius - has a shadowy . reputation which has come under scrutiny in recent years, forcing . organisers to be more open. A . Bilderberg spokesman said in a press release on Monday: ‘The conference . has always been a forum for informal, off-the-record discussions about . megatrends and the major issues facing the world. ‘Thanks . to the private nature of the conference, the participants are not bound . by the conventions of office or by pre-agreed positions. As such, they . can take time to listen, reflect and gather insights.’ Policing resources in Watford have been stretched to accommodate the elite guests that will arrive tomorrow. Protest are expected to break out . The . conference was founded in 1954 as an annual event designed to foster . dialogue between Europe and North America. Between 120 and 150 people . take part each year. They will also debate subjects including . ‘can the U.S. and Europe grow faster and create jobs’, ‘how big data is . changing almost everything’, ‘U.S. foreign policy’ and ‘Africa’s . challenges’. The cloak of secrecy surrounding the meetings bans journalists from attending. Bilderberg follower Charlie Skelton said today he believes this year's conference to attract more attention than ever. He also described how at the 2009 meeting in Greece he was 'being chased around Athens by the Greek secret police'. Speaking to the International Business . Times he said: 'I'm expecting quite a large number of people to be . coming along to Watford to see it'. Google has come under fire in recent weeks over reports that it paid just £10million in corporation tax in Britain between 2006 and 2011, despite revenues of £11.9billion. Amazon said it paid just £2.44million in corporation tax on UK sales of £320million last year - but told investors it in fact turned over 13 times that amount, with British sales of more than £4billion.","Bilderberg Conference being held at the 5-star Grove Hotel in Watford .

"So, farewell Andy Murray. It was good while it lasted, but nothing lasts forever. You may be the current Olympic champion, even the reigning Wimbledon champion, until Sunday at least. But you have won nothing all year, you are 27 years old and the shades of night are falling fast. British tennis expects rather more from its heroes than a string of near-misses and might-have-beens. The old guard is changing, time to move aside. Or so we were told. The reaction to Murray’s defeat in the Wimbledon quarter-finals carried the whiff of an epitaph. He had not merely lost a tennis match, he had disappointed his public, he had let the country down. Worse, he hadn’t behaved terribly well. VIDEO: Scroll down to see fans react to Andy Murray's Wimbledon exit . Harsh: People were quick to criticise Andy Murray after his quarter-final defeat to Grigor Dimitrov at Wimbledon . Aggressive: Murray is believed to have screamed foul-mouthed words during the straight-sets loss . It was reported that the court-side photographers — innocent folk who are strangers to profanity —  apparently heard him yell ‘Shut the f*** up!’ in the direction of his box. The same delicate souls also claimed to have heard him shout “Five minutes before the f*****g match!’, when he was standing beneath the Royal Box, which was occupied at the time by the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge. My dear, the shock! And the shame! Now nobody is justifying the  cavalier use of industrial language, but the presence of royalty seems wholly irrelevant. William experienced seven-and- a-half years of full-time military  service, while Kate is a graduate of the University of St Andrews. It is just possible that they may have heard the charmless term a time or two before. No matter. Murray is the week’s designated whipping boy, and as such he could expect no mercy. In fact, he behaved with genuine dignity in the aftermath of his loss. He paid handsome tribute to his conqueror, Grigor Dimitrov: ‘He was the better player from start to finish.’ He conceded his own shortcomings: ‘I need to make some improvements to my game.’ He spoke of the need to ‘work harder, get stronger and become physically better’. And he offered this philosophical reflection: ‘You can have bad days as an athlete. You don’t win all the time. Sometimes, you just have to take it on the chin and move on.’ Class act: Murray was respectful to Dimitrov after the match, typifying the champion he is . Disappointing: New coach Amelie Mauresmo watches on at Centre Court on Wednesday . He could not have expressed  himself more eloquently. And he spoke as an authentic achiever. Murray was the first British man in 77 years to win the singles title. He had won 23 of his previous 24 matches at Wimbledon, his single defeat being inflicted by Roger Federer. He is ranked five in the world, while the next-best Briton is ranked 143rd. The state of British women’s  tennis is almost equally dire. They are the poor bloody infantry; natural victims for whom the second week of a Grand Slam tournament is a  distant dream. At this level, Murray is our only player, certainly our only star. And he carries the burden pretty well. He faces the questions, tells his tale and asks to be judged by his performance on court. He is not the most avid attention-seeker in his sport; indeed, he may not be the most avid in his own family. But he goes about his work with scrupulous diligence, he wins with grace and loses without recourse to trite excuse. He comes across as a serious man who has emerged into impressive maturity from a faintly gauche  adolescence. Waving goodbye for now: But Murray has matured well, and is carrying the state of British tennis on his shoulders . Shame: But he is still not fully accepted in this country . Yet still he is not fully accepted. He is too intense, too chippy, simply too Scottish for the Home Counties crowd which sits in judgment on such matters. There is a suspicion that Wimbledon has never really forgiven him for not being Tim  Henman. In fact, Henman’s verdict on Murray was a model of fairness and concision: ‘There’s not much to analyse’, he said. ‘Andy didn’t play well and his opponent took full advantage.’ But of course, we can’t leave it there. And so we hear that he  surrendered rather too easily; that he might have pushed himself a  little more vigorously; that he should have worked harder to retain his grip on the title. All this to the greatest tennis player that Britain has ever  produced — and we must discount Fred Perry’s remarkable record on  the grounds that he was playing a different sport  with different equipment  at a quite different pace. Legendary: Murray is the greatest tennis player Britain has ever produced . This time last year: Murray was the hero at Wimbledon, and nobody would dare say a bad word about him . Murray is a towering example  of what may be achieved by a  combination of immense natural  talent and ferocious dedication. After generations of pointless poseurs who imagined that being  No 1 in these islands represented the end of the rainbow, Murray taught us to reject the mundane, to raise our sights, to believe in better. Yet despite all this, he is fatuously chastised, pushed aside long before his time. And all on account of  a single defeat by an urgently  emerging talent. I sense there is unfairness verging on injustice at work here, for the young man is possessed of a talent which British tennis scarcely recognises or deserves. Reports of Andy Murray’s professional demise have been pitifully exaggerated. Soon it will be time to revel in his rebirth.","The criticism of Murray after his Wimbledon 2014 exit is unfair .
British No 1 was knocked out in straight sets by Grigor Dimitrov .
But he was just beaten by the better man on the day, he will return .
He is carrying the state of British tennis on his shoulders .
Made history last year by winning Wimbledon on Centre Court .
He is the greatest player we have ever produced ."
"A Texas mother-of-four is going to face manslaughter charges for the deaths of two of her children after slamming her vehicle into two parked cars last night. Police said that 30-year-old Crytsal Suniga's blood alcohol was twice the legal limit when she lost control of her SUV and crashed near Gilbert  Elementary School on East Pioneer Drive in Irving, Texas, about 8pm on Sunday night. Suniga's two sons - identified by family members as Angel Reyes, 14, and Ricardo Hernandez, 10 - died at the scene, police spokesman James McLellan told WFAA. Her 16-year-old son's pelvis was crushed and her daughter was also injured in the collision and officers said Suniga could have been driving at up to three-times the speed limit. Scroll Down for Video . Victims: Ricardo Hernandez, 10 (left) and Angel Reyes, 14 (right), died in the high-speed crash in which their mother could have been driving up to 100mph while intoxicated . 'They are only estimates at the moment; it could be anywhere from 60-70 miles per hour, up to 90-100 miles per hour, but the investigation is still in the early stages,' Irving Police Officer James McLellan said on Sunday. Police said Suniga is currently being treated for unspecified injuries at the Parkland Memorial Hospital in Dallas. Witness Noe Osuna said that the scene of the crash was horrifying. 'We heard a little girl screaming for help, and we ran with my brothers to try to get people out,' said Osuna to NBC DFW. 'We didn’t know until the little girl said that there were still two kids in the car, that’s when we tried to break the window, open the other windows. That’s when we saw the bodies,' he said. Police have said that all the children were wearing seatbelts. Raging fire: The wreckage of Crystal Suniga's SUV reveals the crash scene where she smashed into two parked cars while driving under the influence of alcohol at speeds of up to 100mph . 'In this case, that didn’t seem to restrain them enough to keep them from being partially ejected and killed,' said Officer McLellan. Investigators have said that Suniga's blood alcohol level was measured at 0.18 - which is twice the legal limit. Irving police said she is charged with two counts of intoxication manslaughter and two counts of injury to a child as well. 'Certainly it’s tragic,' McLellan said to The Dallas Morning News. 'Here’s someone who caused the death of her two children. It was completely avoidable and unnecessary, but she still needs to be held accountable.' Clean-up: This is the front porch in Irving, Texas this morning after the SUV was removed and the fire damage had been dealt with . Another witness to the crash, Eric Sorto, said he heard what sounded like a bomb going off outside his home when Suniga crashed into the cars. His father's pickup truck was damaged and the force of the impact sent the tailgate onto the roof of his home. 'It was like a nightmare,' he said, 'like seeing something you’d see in a movie.' Adan Ozuna, who lives next door to Sorto, said Suniga's 12-year-old daughter girl kept screaming for him to help her brothers who were pinned under the car. Scene: Suniga allegedly lost control of her sport utility vehicle and crashed near Gilbert Elementary School on East Pioneer Drive in Irving, Texas, (pictured) Scene: Suniga was taken to Parkland Memorial Hospital in Dallas (pictured) with minor injuries . 'We tried to lift the car to try to save them, but the SUV was too heavy,' he said. 'We couldn’t move it.' Leslie Weaver, a spokeswoman for the Irving Independent School District, said the two boy who died attended Gilbert Elementary School and Austin Middle school. Grief counselors will be at each location on Monday, she said.","Crystal Suniga charged with intoxication manslaughter .

"It was a trend started by Andy Murray’s hiring of Ivan Lendl and we see its ultimate manifestation in the fascinating sub-plot to Sunday's men’s Wimbledon final. Boris Becker and Stefan Edberg faced off 35 times in their career, with three of those being on this very same occasion. Now the rivalry rekindles itself by proxy, with their respective coaching charges Novak Djokovic and Roger Federer going for the ultimate prize. It is a sweet coincidence that this will also be the 35th meeting between this afternoon’s finalists, although their career record against each other (18-16 to the Swiss) is much closer than the 25-10 superiority of the German over the Swede. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Novak Djokovic: Wimbledon is 'home' for coach Boris Becker . Rivalry: Stefan Edberg and Boris Becker met three times in Wimbledon final . However, Becker is painfully aware that in three of their four Grand Slam final meetings he lost, and that includes two of their three consecutive Wimbledon finals between 1988 and 1990. A quarter of a century on, Edberg barely looks a day older than he did then, that sublimely easy mover who could glide to the net as if his feet never touched the ground, so often delivering a beautifully executed volley to win the point. He has lived an uncomplicated, low-profile existence since and is said to have multiplied his fortune from tennis by working as a high-end financial planner for himself and others. Becker has had a far more complex existence in both his business and private lives, and middle age is a more obvious intruder on his much larger frame. ‘Stefan was my biggest rival,’ said Becker. ‘Always a nice guy off the court but a very difficult opponent on it. He always had such control of himself and was such a great natural athlete. In some ways losing that 1990 final was one of the most  difficult matches to get over in  my career. In these matches, we can give our players some of the  things we learned from our experience.’ Incredible: Roger Federer will play his 25th Slam final on Sunday . Murray’s partnership with Lendl has spawned a host of copycat arrangements. Croatian quarter-finalist Marin Cilic, for example, works with his compatriot Goran Ivanisevic, and Japan’s rising star Kei Nishikori is with Michael Chang. In all cases the modern-day players are seeking to garner that little bit of stardust from those they once idolised. Federer has described Edberg as his boyhood hero, and this year it has been clear that the Swede has acted as extra inspiration — hard to find when you are a 32-year-old who has won 17 major titles and has nothing to prove. The key to Federer’s longevity is quite simple: he loves the game as much as he ever did and the Swede, now 48, is part of that, as is the challenge of doing it with a large, young family in tow.‘Stefan is clearly a piece of the puzzle but then so is my fitness trainer and Severin (Luthi, his longstanding general coach and confidant), and everybody around me,’ said Federer. ‘They make it possible to wake up every morning motivated, healthy, fit and eager to play. ‘The fun for me is being able to do it at this age. I know so many people on the tour after being on it for so many years and travelling on it is still something I really enjoy. It’s the whole package. You’ve got to love the game because if you don’t, it’s too hard to keep going.’ Focus: Roger Federer (left) and coach Stefan Edberg (right) take part in a practice session on court four . Federer is a month away from his 33rd birthday. We should enjoy him  while we can because even he cannot keep going for ever. It is hard to imagine him going all the way at any other Grand Slam but a key this fortnight has been that he has got through his matches relatively quickly and that they have been on what is, for the body, the most forgiving of surfaces.Only on grass, where his ability to come forward is most rewarded,  can you look at this match-up and struggle who to pick as favourite. Do not believe that there is anything other than a massive incentive for Federer to win. Aside from wanting to prove wrong those of us who believed 2012 would be his last Grand Slam title, it is a priceless, and possibly last, opportunity to add to his tally. With Rafael Nadal on 14 Slam titles but aged 28, it could be very tight who ends up with the most, and one more for the Swiss might yet make all the difference. There is also not a great deal of love lost between Federer and Djokovic, the 27-year-old Serb who hardly lacks for motivation either. Experience: World No 2 Novak Djokovic will contest his eighth Slam final . For such an incredible competitor it is remarkable that Djokovic has lost five of his last six Grand Slam finals, and he is without a major title since the Australian Open 18 months ago. His most lacklustre display in all of those was probably this time a year ago, although he faced an inspired Andy Murray at the height of his grasscourt powers, plus the whole of the Centre Court. Federer is certain to be the huge sentimental favourite again today, and the crowd support could be a factor again. And do not underestimate how important this is for Becker. His appointment last December was greeted with much scepticism, and with Djokovic’s other coach Marian Vajda absent (he wants to travel less) the German has been running the show. For Becker, a Djokovic victory would represent quite a comeback in itself. Helping hand: Novak Djokovic of Serbia talks with his coach Boris Becker during a practice session on Saturday .","Becker and Edberg faced off 35 times, three times at Wimbledon .

"An Iraq war veteran who was the alleged victim of a racially motivated beating in Mississippi continues to improve but is 'not coming home anytime soon,' his father said. Former U.S. Marine Ralph Weems, 32, suffered a traumatic brain injury after being attacked by a large group of black men in a restaurant parking lot in West Point in August. After the attack, Weems had surgery and was put in a medically induced coma. He began treatment at a VA rehabilitation facility in Texas where he learned to walk again and is now set to move to a facility in either Louisiana or Arkansas. Former U.S. Marine Ralph Weems, 32, suffered a traumatic brain injury after being attacked by a large group of black men in a restaurant parking lot in West Point in August . Weems and his friend were followed to the parking lot of this Huddle House by a group of more than 20 black men who proceeded to attack them . 'He's physically made a lot of improvements,' Weems III told the Clarion-Ledger. 'Traumatic brain injury takes a long time to recover in a lot of ways.' A Gofundme webpage setup to help pay for his medical expenses has so far received over $9,000, but is hoping to raise $25,000. Weems and a friend visited a Waffle House in late August, but soon left after a man politely told the pair that the restaurant was not safe for white people. David Knighten of West Point said the man told him that people were upset by the killing of unarmed teenager Michael Brown in Ferguson just weeks earlier. The pair went into the restaurant anyway, but Weems started arguing with around seven black men and so they left, said Knighten. A Waffle House employee told police who answered a 1am disturbance call that a patron was creating a disturbance and upsetting other patrons. Courtez McMillian, Constance McFarland and Marquavious McMillian, from left to right, have been charged with aggravated assault in connection with the alleged attack . Weems and a friend visited this Waffle House in late August, but soon left after a man politely told the pair that the restaurant was not safe for white people . After Weems was asked to leave, employees also asked the other patrons to leave. On the way to Weems' house, Knighten said, they went into a Huddle House restaurant with a nearly vacant parking lot but were followed by a group of more than 20 black men. Knighten, who had served with the Air Force in Afghanistan, said he came out of the restroom to find Weems surrounded. 'I was trying to defuse the situation,' he said. After some shoving, he said, the security guard told everyone to leave. Knighten said some people blocked him from leaving with Weems. When he got out, he said, Weems was down and people were kicking him. After the attack, Weems had brain surgery and was put in a medically induced coma. He began treatment at a VA rehabilitation facility in Texas and is now set to move to a facility in either Louisiana or Arkansas . Knighten said others attacked him, adding 'I do remember racial slurs being yelled from the crowd.' Police were called to the Huddle House about 2am and West Point Police Chief Tim Brinkley said the evidence suggested it was 'a verbal altercation turned physical and somebody got hurt.' The FBI and the Mississippi Bureau of Investigation have yet to determine if the case is a hate crime. In November, Constance Levail McFarland, 21, became the third man to be charged with aggravated assault in connection with the alleged attack. Marquavious McMillian, 20, and Courtez McMillian, 22, were arrested in August in connection with the incident.","Ralph Weems, 32, suffered a traumatic brain injury after being attacked by a large group of black men in West Point in August .

"Donald Sterling's estranged wife issued a strong statement against his racist recordings but new court records have revealed that she also has a history of making incendiary comments about minorities. Rochelle 'Shelly' Sterling has been legally married to the Clippers owner since 1955 though they have long been described as being separated and estranged. Court documents discovered by the Los Angeles Times names Shelly as part of a discrimination lawsuit filed against the couple by their former tenants, with one African American resident claiming that she called him a 'black motherf*****' during an argument. Estranged but connected: Donald Sterling's comments got him banned from the NBA but his wife Shelly- the couple is separated- has also been noted as making racist remarks in earlier lawsuits . 'I asked her again, I asked her, ""would you reduce the rent?""' and she said, ‘who do you think you are, you black motherf*****,' tenant Darrell Rhodes said in the 2009 deposition. 'The way in which she said motherf***** was more lower voiced, under her breath. She said black loud enough for me to hear, she said mother loud enough for me to hear. F— part was a little lower. I had to look at her lips to hear her say it. And I did.' Still allowed in: Shelly was seen cheering on the Clippers when they won against the Golden State Warriors on Tuesday night, just hours after Donald had been banned indefinitely from the NBA . The incident with Mr Rhodes, which was a part of a larger discrimination case that ended in Sterling paying a $2.75million settlement to the Justice Department, was not the only one that suggests Mrs Sterling's personal beliefs are rather in line with that of her husband. One of the on-site property managers that the Sterlings employed said in a deposition how Shelly complained about how her minority tenants kept the apartments from staying clean. 'She said, ""Oh, my God. This is so filthy. I can’t remodel my apartments the way that I want because Latinos are so filthy,""' manager Maira Oliva said of Shelly. When asked for clarification about the exact phrasing, Ms Oliva recalled Shelly saying: 'I can’t remodel my building the way I want and that the building was filthy because of the Latinos.' Mrs Sterling's actions were at the center of an earlier court case, when a different property supervisor accused Shelly of sneaking her way into tenant's apartments by claiming to be a health inspector. 'Sumner Davenport declares that when she worked for Sterling she often accompanied Rochelle Sterling on apartment inspections, that Rochelle Sterling would regularly pose as a government official in order to gain access to tenants’ apartments,' a court order obtained by the Los Angeles Times reads. The judge reportedly called the accusations 'troubling' but found insufficient evidence to try the case, leading to an out of court settlement with the Housing Rights Center. Though her husband has been issued a lifetime ban from the NBA and ordered to pay a $2.5million fine, Shelly still has a number of supporters within the basketball family. The Clipper's coach Doc Rogers told Yahoo News that he spoke to Shelly on Tuesday and 'she has been through as much as anyone as well'. Hurtful words: Shelly (pictured here on Sunday) was listed as making derogatory remarks about black and Latino tenants in the mid-to-late 2000s . Times of need: Shelly was seen going to dinner Sunday with her estranged husband just hours after releasing a statement condemning his racist recording . 'It’s a tough one for Shelly, really,' Rivers said following the team's victory against the Golden State Warriors on Tuesday. “ . 'She didn’t do anything wrong either. You have compassion for her. I kept hearing about the girlfriend. I kept thinking, ""Shelly is the wife."" You know what I mean?' That sentiment was echoed by former Clippers star Ron Harper who played for the Los Angeles team under the Sterling’s purview for five years before leaving in 1994. 'The only bad part is I know how much his wife loves the team and mostly I feel sad for her,’ Harper told The New York Post. 'When I was there she was very good and kind to me... I was at a game last year, sat down and ate with her. She loves the team and the sport and loves basketball. She knows what’s going on. It’s probably going to hurt her more than him. The other woman: Shelly is in the midst of a lawsuit against her estranged husband's girlfriend V. Stiviano (left), who is the woman on the other end of the racist recording . 'The only way any of those sponsors are going to return is if they sell that team. If he transfers the power over to her, it still feels like he owns that team.' While Donald Sterling has been banned from attending any NBA games or stepping foot in any facility associated with the Clippers, the same ban has not been extended to his wife. She was seen at the Tuesday night game and took a seat in the lower bowl area- as opposed to her normal courtside seat. She was wearing head-to-toe black which is believed to be in support of the player who have been wearing black socks and armbands since the racist recording was released Saturday morning.","Disgraced LA Clippers owner Donald Sterling's wife has an alleged history of making racist comments as well .

"Ed Miliband hopes of seizing power next year were rocked last night by a poll suggesting Labour faces a wipeout in Scotland. Ipsos Mori found that 52 per cent of Scots would vote for the SNP if there was a Westminster election tomorrow, compared with just 23 per cent for Labour. If the findings are repeated next May, Labour will lose 37 of its 41 seats in its Scottish heartland, dealing a major blow to Mr Miliband’s hopes of becoming prime minister. Nicola Sturgeon is the new SNP leader vowing to take on Ed Miliband, whose hopes of becoming Prime Minister could rest on securing dozens of seats in Scotland . The results would deliver the SNP an incredible 54 seats, potentially leaving them as kingmakers at Westminster. The poll also makes gloomy reading for Tories and Lib Dems, putting them on 10 and 6 per cent respectively. High-profile victims of such a swing to the SNP would include Labour’s shadow foreign secretary Douglas Alexander and the Lib Dem Treasury Chief Secretary Danny Alexander. The shock poll for STV News follows a calamitous period for Labour in Scotland, which has seen it lose power in the Scottish Parliament and struggle to connect with many traditional supporters in the recent referendum campaign. Mr Miliband, who was in Glasgow last night at a gala dinner for Labour supporters, denied the party was in disarray north of the border. The Labour leader acknowledged it had been a tough week following the resignation of Scottish Labour leader Johann Lamont, who quit with a parting blast at the Westminster leadership. But he insisted Labour could still win the General Election. A surprise new IpsosMORI poll for STV reveals how support for the SNP has surged since 2010 . ‘I look forward to working shoulder to shoulder with whoever the party in Scotland elects as leader to win that election,’ he said. ‘We face a tough fight but no tougher than the fights we have faced in the past.’ One Labour source even suggested the poll could help the party by reinforcing the message that voting for the SNP will help David Cameron to retain power. But the senior Scottish Labour MP Thomas Docherty said the party was in a ‘dreadful position’ in Scotland. Mr Docherty, shadow deputy leader of the Commons, said: ‘The state that the Labour party is in right now is we are in a dreadful position. ‘We’ve got to be honest about ourselves. The electorate looks at us and has no idea what our policies are. We have a moribund party in Scotland that seems to think that in-fighting is more important than campaigning. And we have a membership that is ageing and inactive. ‘We can return to be the grown-up party that wants to be in government or we can self-indulge like a throwback to the 1980s and watch our party implode, the SNP win again, the Tories win again, and have another referendum.’ Former Labour Cabinet minister Jim Murphy has confirmed he will stand for the leadership in Scotland, but the prominent Blairite may struggle to pick up union support and is expected to face a stiff challenge from Left-wingers. Labour is braced for possible defeat in another heartland today, with Ukip quietly confident of winning the by-election for a police and crime commissioner for South Yorkshire. It was sparked when Labour’s Shaun Wright quit following controversy over his handling of the Rotherham child sex abuse scandal. Labour MP Thomas Docherty warned his party was in a 'dreadful position' A Labour frontbencher today issued a damning assessment of the party's fortunes. Thomas Docherty, shadow Deputy Leader of the House, warned his party is in a 'dreadful position'. The Dunfermline and West Fife claimed Labour is now 'moribund' in Scotland and risks being plunged into infighting. He told BBC Radio 4's World at One: ‘The state that the Labour party is in right now is we are in a dreadful position.' He said Labour has 'got to be honest about ourselves', adding: 'We have very low esteem with the electorate. The electorate looks at us and has no idea what our polices are. 'We have a moribund party in Scotland that seems to think that infighting is more important than campaigning. 'And we have a membership that is ageing and inactive. We can return to be the grown-up party that wants to be in government or we can self-indulge like a throwback to the 1980s and watch our party implode, the SNP win again, the Tories win again, and have another referendum.' At the 2010 general election Labour won 42 per cent of the Scottish vote, compared with the SNP's share of 19.9 per cent. The poll was carried out amid a turbulent period for Scottish Labour, which culminated in the resignation of leader Johann Lamont on Friday. She stepped down with an attack on UK Labour colleagues whom she accused of treating Scotland as a 'branch office'. A leadership race is now in full swing, with Mr Murphy and Lothian MSPs Neil Findlay and Sarah Boyack vying for the position. Speaking before details of the poll emerged, Mr Murphy, the latest candidate to declare, pledged to end the streak of 'losing Labour' in Scotland. The shadow international development secretary told BBC News he is confident he can turn around the party's fortunes in Scotland and hold the party's current Westminster seats. He said: 'I'm not interested in left-wing Labour or right-wing Labour, or old Labour or new Labour. I'm interested in losing Labour. 'I want to end that period of losing Labour here in Scotland, starting with the UK general election in 2015, where I'm confident we can hold all the seats we currently have but pick up one or two on top, and also win that election in 2016 for the Scottish Parliament.' Pledging to unite the party, Mr Murphy said: 'There is so much that has to change about the Labour Party and so much that has to change about our country. 'I'm determined to bring the Labour Party together, end the period of self-harm that we've had in the Scottish Labour Party and get on and improve our country.' He denied Ms Lamont's claim that the Scottish party has been treated like a branch office. Mr Murphy said: 'I don't think the Scottish Labour Party has ever been run in that way. 'The Scottish Labour Party takes so many of its own decisions but I want to do more of that. I want to devolve and have a more autonomous Scottish Labour Party. 'I'm confident that I can appeal not just to Scottish Labour voters, not just to trade unions, but to people who are undecided, people who turned away from us in recent elections in Scotland and build that movement for change here in Scotland.' Former premier Mr Brown ruled himself out of the running in the leadership contest but Mr Murphy plans to meet him to discuss further devolution for the Scottish Parliament. He said MSPs James Kelly and Jenny Marra will act as joint chairs of his leadership team. He will formally launch his campaign this weekend under the slogan Leading Labour, Changing Scotland.","IpsosMori poll has SNP on 52%, Labour 23%, Tories 10%, Lib Dems 6% .

"Parents, pay attention. If you let out a groan every time your children have a snow day off school, this video could be for you. It was put together by North Carolina couple Penn and Lynn Holderness, from Raleigh, who performed an hilarious song with their children Penn and Lola to post on YouTube. Already, the video - title Snow Day The Musical - has had more than 600,000 views since it was posted last week. Scroll down for video . In the video by Penn and Lynn Holderness, from Raleigh, they are woken up at 6am . The snow hasn't escaped the attention of the couple's children, who want to get out and play . Mr and Mrs Holderness are the same people who recorded and released a rap video of them in their Christmas pyjamas in December. It ended up with more than 13 million hits. The family's new video chronicles a typical day in which the children are home because there is no school due to snow. The song's story begins at 6am, when father Penn wakes up with a sigh and feels 'like Bob Costas's left eye'. Already the children are up and ready to go and by 7am the parents have been forced out to go sledding. Needless to say parents Penn and Lynn Holderness are still waking up and want their coffee . By 7am the children are out enjoying the snow on their sled . By 10am young Penn needs to go to the rest room but claims he is wearing too many layers and 'going inside would spoil [the fun we're having]'. The Holdernesses move inside at 4pm to watch a few movies. By 8am father Penn needs to finish some work. Then his wife Lynn sings about the long lines at the supermarket when she went to grab bread and milk, when all the parents really need is wine. The video ends with the exhausted parents slumped on the couch at the end of the evening, only to find out that school is canceled tomorrow, too. At midday Penn has had enough, he's cold and tired and wants to be indoors . The Holdernesses move inside at 4pm to watch a few movies. By 8am father Penn needs to finish some work .

"Ukip's latest attempt to draw a line under accusations of racism and extremism suffered a fresh blow today as it emerged one of its candidates used his Facebook page to 'like' a series of Nazi war criminals. The row threatened to overshadow a bizarre ethnic minority ‘rally’ hosted by Nigel Farage in London in a bid to show he does not lead a racist party. Black and ethnic minority candidates and councillors were paraded at the ‘myth-busting’ event in an attempt to counter a string of damaging stories about racist and sexist comments made by some Ukip candidates. Scroll down for video . Nigel Farage rejected accusations of racism leveled against the party at last night's ethnic minority rally in London . The Ukip leader said the party was not racist - and paraded a host of ethnic minority supporters as proof . John Withill, who is standing as a UKIP candidate in the Armley ward of Leeds, West Yorks, created a section on his public Facebook page listing a collection of ‘inspirational people’. Anti-racism group Hope Not Hate say the people he ‘likes’ include convicted war criminals Kurt Student, Albert Kesselring and Albert Speer. Speaking ahead of last night's event Nigel Farage conceded that too many ‘idiots’ had slipped through the party’s vetting procedures and said he planned to ‘fight back’ against the impression they had made. Last night’s event was targeted by more than 100 anti-fascist demonstrators. Amid chaotic scenes, more than a dozen were ejected from the hall by security guards after heckling Ukip speakers. A noisy group of around 100 anti-fascism protesters gathered outside the building. The party paraded around 50 black and minority ethnic councillors and election candidates on the stage, who stood behind Mr Farage as he spoke. Amjad Bashir, the party’s small and medium size business spokesman, told the rally: ‘Take a look at all the faces and skin colours represented on this stage and tell me Ukip is a racist party.’ Ukip’s drive to feature more diverse supporters underlines concerns about the damage being done by exposure of the racist views of some of its supporters. Until now, it has tended to claim it is being singled out for criticism and suggested it will not bow to political correctness. Andre Lampitt, the star of Ukip’s latest political broadcast, was suspended last month for claiming Ed Miliband is ‘not British’, Africans should ‘kill themselves off’ and Nigerians are ‘bad people’. Other council candidates subject to disciplinary action by the party include a conspiracy theorist linking the Prince of Wales to allegations of paedophilia on the basis that he knew Jimmy Savile, and another who suggested that Lenny Henry should emigrate to a ‘black country’. Earlier this month Mr Farage launched the party's Euro-elections billboard campaign, with a controversial picture of an escalator welcoming immigrants to Britain . Addressing last night’s rally, Mr Farage said: ‘I don’t care if you disagree with us, I don’t care if you think we’d be better off in government with Cameron, Miliband or Clegg, I don’t care if you think uncontrolled immigration is better for Britain, I don’t care what you call us - right wing, left wing, small minded. But from this moment on please do not ever call us a racist party. We are not a racist party.’ He said that only those who share the party’s views can become members and that its membership forms clearly state that extremists are not welcome. But he added: ‘There will always be a few people who creep over the line and cause us embarrassment. I would rather for the ten people out of 2,234 ‎who have said things that are extremist or offensive that it hadn’t happened. ‘These idiotic statements of a handful of people have been lifted up as representing the view of the party, but they never have and never will.’ The Leeds candidate who 'liked' Nazi war leaders on his Facebook page dismissed claims it had anything to do with his politics. It came after Mr Withill was condemned by anti-fascist campaigners. He insisted his Nazi 'likes' merely showed an interest in military history. He said he also ‘liked’ historical figures such as George Washington and Gandhi. Hope Not Hate writer Simon Cressey said: 'We all have heroes and we all take inspiration from a variety of people. So imagine my amazement when I discovered that a Leeds UKIP candidate listed a number of Nazi war criminals as some of  the people that inspired him.' But on his Facebook page Mr Withill defended himself, claiming that Hope Not Hate were trying to imply that 'knowledge and interest in some of the Military leaders of the Third Reich implies that in some way my politics is influenced  by this'.","Ukip leader Nigel Farage demands end to racist accusations against party .

"An independent Scotland would find itself at the back of the queue to get into the EU, David Cameron claimed today. The Prime Minister said Scotland would have to wait its turn behind Serbia, Macedonia and Montenegro before it would be readmitted. Mr Cameron's provocative remarks come after the Scottish Tories announced that they now backed full income tax powers for the Edinburgh Government - if the country voted to stay in the United Kingdom. David Cameron told workers at an electrical goods warehouse in Newark that Scotland would not automatically get back into the EU if it left the UK. He said the country would have to apply like every other country . David Cameron risked a Conservative backlash by going much further than Labour in offering new powers to Scotland in a bid to persuade voters to reject independence later this year. The PM's remarks are also likely to infuriate Scottish nationalists who insist that the country would not even have to reapply for membership of the EU if it voted for independence. Mr Salmond has predicted that negotiations to stay in the EU 'will be completed within the 18-month period between a yes vote in September and achieving independence in March 2016'. But European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso has said it would be 'extremely difficult, if not impossible' for Scotland to join. Today Mr Cameron insisted Scotland would have to 'queue up' like all other countries trying to get into the Brussels club. He also hit out at Alex Salmond's decision to block Scots living in England from taking part in September's independence referendum. Mr Cameron said it was a 'source of regret' that Scottish people living in the rest of the UK would not be able to vote in the poll - but insisted that the decision was Mr Salmond's. The PM made the remarks on the campaign trail in Newark this morning ahead of Thursday's by-election. He said: 'If Scotland vote for independence they are no longer members of the EU and it's become clearer and clearer since this campaign started that they would have to reapply to join the EU and as such, as an independent country, they would have to queue up as it were behind other countries - for instance those in the western Balkans that are already on the path towards membership. 'This is yet another reason why I very much hope that the Scottish people will vote no, will vote to remain in the United Kingdom. I think we're a successful family of nations all bringing something to this United Kingdom. 'Let's hope that we'll stay together. I think the risks of separation are very great.' Mr Cameron was in Newark campaigning on behalf of the Conservative candidate Robert Jenrick in the upcoming by-election, where he is desperate to hold off UKIP's challenger Roger Helmer . Serbia, Montenegro and Macedonia are all categorised as candidate countries by the European Union, meaning they are in the process of integrating their laws with the EU. Mr Cameron said he was 'confident' that the No campaign would win and said the issue of Europe was just one of the risks. He added: 'The risk that outside the UK you wouldn't keep the pound, the risk that outside the UK you've got to reapply to the EU, the risk that outside the UK you wouldn't have such a strong economy with so many jobs and you know in the end its a positive argument I'm making because I think the UK has been a great success story. 'We're there for each other. You know when there was a banking crisis and a big Scottish bank goes down you've got the whole of the UK there to support that bank and that economy. We're stronger and better off together. 'We obviously have great rivalry on the football field and rugby field and one or two other things but we're a family of nations and I hope we stay together.' Scottish Tory leader Ruth Davidson today u-turned on her previous opposition to further devolution by backing plans to hand the Holyrood Parliament full income tax powers . Some Tories warned the move would fuel resentment in England and disenfranchise Scots who do not want the Scottish Parliament to have chance to levy swingeing new taxes on the better off. MP Philip Davies said: ‘This is an idiotic idea that will only serve to hasten the break-up of the UK. 'How can you have a referendum where you get more independence whether you vote yes or no? 'Where does that leave people who want to preserve the Union as it is?’ Scottish Tory leader Ruth Davidson meanwhile today came out in support of full tax raising powers for Scotland. She said Holyrood was like 'a tricycle' where politicians can spend without any accountability for their actions in the tax system. She has pledged to 'take the stabilisers off' and give the Scottish Government full control over income tax if it votes No to independence, as part of the Tories' devolution offering drafted by former Leader of the House of Lords, Tom Strathclyde. Mr Cameron and Chancellor George Osborne have backed the proposals, Ms Davidson said. Launching the report of the Strathclyde Commission in Glasgow, Ms Davidson said: 'What we have at the moment is like a tricycle, what the Scotland Act 2012 brings in is a bike with stabilisers, and what this builds on is taking the stabilisers off. First Minister Alex Salmond has dismissed promises by the unionist parties to hand more powers to Edinburgh in the event of a 'No' vote. He has also insisted that an independent Scotland will not have to reapply to join the European Union . 'So it does allow MSPs to take decisions not just over the rates of taxation that we levy, but it also allows them to vary one or more. 'It allows them to introduce a new band of income tax. It allows them to find the formula that best allows the work that the particular government of the day wants to carry out and has a mandate for in Scotland. 'I think that flexibility shows a responsibility.' Scottish VAT receipts should also be given to the Scottish Parliament, according to the Strathclyde Commission. Holyrood should be given more responsibility on some welfare issues, particularly where a cash benefit is related to a devolved policy area such as housing benefit and attendance allowance, it said. All three parties supporting Better Together are now signed up to giving Edinburgh more powers if the country votes to stay in the UK.","Prime Minister says an independent Scotland would have to wait to join EU .

"Sales of household goods soared by 12.7 per cent last month compared with August last year. It is the largest annual increase since 2001. File photo . The rush to buy powerful vacuum cleaners before an EU ban has been a major boost for the High Street, official figures revealed yesterday. Sales of household goods soared by 12.7 per cent last month compared with August last year. It is the largest annual increase since 2001. In electrical appliance stores alone, sales were 10.3 per cent higher than in 2013, and the amount spent rose by 6.4 per cent. The Office for National Statistics said the surge had been partly caused by the stampede to buy high-powered vacuum cleaners. The rush, in which some retailers reported a fourfold leap in vacuum sales, came after the Mail highlighted the EU’s impending ban – and offered readers an exclusive discount on top Hoover models. The EU directive, which came into effect on September 1, banned cleaners of more than 1,600 watts in a bid to reduce energy consumption. This will be lowered even further to 900 watts by 2017. Kate Davies, of the ONS’s retail sales index, said: ‘August is usually a quiet month but the feedback we are getting from retailers is that the rise in electrical stores was very much down to vacuum cleaners.’ The Co-operative Electrical shop said sales of vacuum cleaners rose by 60 per cent between July and August this year. A spokesman said: ‘Vacuum cleaners were a big-selling item last month. ‘We have also seen an increase in the sale of vacuum cleaners year over the last twelve months, which are up 20 per cent since August 2013. This has been one of the drivers behind a successful year.’ Furniture sales also drove up business for household goods stores last month, rocketing by 23.4 per cent – the largest annual increase since records began in 1988. Analysts attributed the boom to the healthy property market, as many Britons look to redecorate their new homes. Alan Clarke, a strategist at Scotiabank, said: ‘Household goods sales are posting double digit annual growth. ‘That is probably no surprise in an environment of rapid house price inflation, where people feel inclined to splash out or those moving house buy new appliances.’ Across the entire retail industry, sales were up by 3.9 per cent in August compared with last year, and the total amount spent also rose by 2.7 per cent. But while sales and spending increased, stores dropped their prices by 1.2 per cent, the largest fall since July 2009. Prices in food shops fell for the first time since December 2004, dropping by 0.1 per cent over the year, which the ONS said was ‘in part due to “supermarket price wars”.’ Helal Miah, an investment research analyst at The Share Centre, said sales figures had benefited from ‘benign weather conditions and the one off impetus of a rush to buy powerful vacuum cleaners’. He added that the figures show ‘consumer spending remains fairly robust’, despite a lack of wage rises. This week, ONS figures showed workers received the worst annual pay rises on record for a third consecutive month. The average salary increased by just 0.7 per cent, less than half the current rate of inflation at 1.5 per cent.","In electrical appliance stores, sales were 10.3% higher than in 2013 .

"Rizana Nafeek was beheaded by sword despite pleas for a pardon from her native Sri Lanka . A maid convicted of killing a baby has been beheaded in Saudi Arabia, despite being only 17 at the time of the crime. Rizana Nafeek was beheaded by sword in Dawadmy, near the capital Riyadh, on Wednesday morning. The execution went ahead despite years of international appeals from Miss Nafeek's family and human rights groups. Supporters of the housemaid, from Sri Lanka, say the age on her passport was changed so she could get work and that according to her birth certificate she was just 17 at the time. The Sri Lankan government said it 'deplores the execution' and human rights groups also condemned her death. Miss Nafeek was sentenced to death in 2007 after her Saudi employer accused her of strangling his four-month-old baby two years earlier after a dispute with the child's mother. But Miss Nafeek always protested her innocence and said the baby had choked to death while being bottle fed. Her parents repeatedly appealed to . King Abdullah to pardon their daughter. The Sri Lankan government . also appealed against the death penalty but the Saudi Supreme Court . upheld it in 2010. It was again ratified by the Saudi interior ministry yesterday. The . Sri Lankan foreign ministry said in a statement that President Mahinda . Rajapaksa twice personally appealed to the Saudi government to halt the . execution and pardon Miss Nafeek. Rizana Nafeek's passport states she was born in 1982 but her birth certificate states she would only have been 17 at the time of the alleged killing . It added: 'President Rajapaksa and the government of Sri Lanka deplore the execution of Miss Rizana Nafeek despite all efforts at the highest level of the government and the outcry of the people locally and internationally over the death sentence of a juvenile housemaid.' The government held a minute's silence on Wednesday. Amnesty International said the passport Miss Nafeek used to enter Saudi Arabia in May 2005 stated she was born in February, 1982. However, the group said her birth certificate states she was born six years later, making her just 17 at the time of the baby's death. Human Rights Watch also condemned the execution. Nisha Varia, senior women's rights . researcher at the organisation, said: 'Saudi . Arabia is one of just three countries that executes people for crimes . they committed as children. Rizana Nafeek's mother, left, repeatedly appealed to Saudi Arabia's King Abdullah to pardon their daughter but the death penalty was ratified on Wednesday . 'In . executing Rizana Nafeek, Saudi authorities demonstrated callous . disregard for basic humanity as well as Saudi Arabia's international . legal obligations.' Miss . Nafeek said her original confession and been made under duress and there . translation services were not made available to her. Amnesty International said Miss Nafeek had no access to lawyers either during her pre-trial interrogation or at her 2007 trial. Philip Luther, the organisation's Middle East and North . Africa programme director, said the day before the execution: 'It appears that she was herself a child . at the time and there are real concerns about the fairness of her . trial.' Saudi households are highly dependent on housemaids from African and South Asian countries and there are reportedly 1.5million domestic servants working in the oil-rich country. There have been reported cases of domestic abuse in which families mistreat their maids, who have then attacked the children of their employers. Saudi Arabia is an absolute monarchy that follows the strict Wahhabi school of Islam and applies sharia law. Last year as many as 76 people were beheaded, according to The Telegraph.","Rizana Nafeek was beheaded by sword in Saudi Arabia on Wednesday .

"Anthony McErlean not only faked his own death but had also been claiming pensions relating to his late father-in-law from a previous marriage . Fraudster Anthony McErlean had everything in place to pocket a hefty £520,000 life insurance pay-out. After faking his own death the pensioner impersonated his wife and claimed he had been knocked down and killed by a cabbage lorry in Honduras. But, unlike Canoe Man John Darwin, who fooled insurers into making a payout, McErlean didn’t get a penny. His suspicious insurance company contacted the police – who found the conman’s fingerprints on his own bogus death certificate. The twice-married former insurance salesman was jailed for six years yesterday after admitting fraud and stealing £68,000 by claiming two pensions in the name of his late father-in-law. Sentencing McErlean, 66, who has convictions dating back to 1963, judge Adele Williams told him the 'deliberate and calculated fraud’ had been carried out 'to gratify your overweening greed’. His case at Canterbury Crown Court bears striking similarities to that of John Darwin who faked his demise with wife Anne in a £680,000 insurance swindle before fleeing to Panama. He and his wife were jailed in 2008 after he reappeared claiming to have lost his memory. McErlean’s bogus claim was made to Glasgow-based Ace European Insurance in the name of father-of-two McErlean’s Honduran wife Sonya. The fake witness statement, from a man named Ronald Lodge, recounted the tragic account of how McErlean was killed in December 2009. He was, apparently, knocked over as he tried to change a tyre on his vehicle during a wildlife photography trip in Honduras. The fake death certificate on which, in a complete giveaway, insurers found McErlean's own fingerprints . The 'witness’ described how farm workers transported McErlean to a small village where local people 'took care of the body’. The following month insurers received . documents, reputedly from McErlean’s wife, which included a death . certificate, police report into the crash and a claim form for the . conman’s accidental death policy. At an earlier hearing at Canterbury . Crown Court prosecutor Donna East said: 'The company expressed some . suspicions about the claim.’ Detectives found McErlean’s . fingerprints on the bogus death certificate and matched them to prints . already held. The conman had served three and a half years behind bars . in 1975 for robbery. He was arrested and during police . interviews said he 'didn’t want to be destitute in old age’, claiming he . got into £150,000 worth of debts while looking after his terminally ill . first wife. He said his second wife had no knowledge of the scam and that he had obtained the documents by bribing officials in Honduras. After being charged with fraud earlier . this year McErlean was freed on strict bail conditions banning him from . trying to leave the UK. But the day after his release from custody last . March he applied for a new passport claiming he had lost his last one – . which had been seized by police. Detectives intercepted the new passport and re-arrested McErlean several days later.

In 2009 they moved to Honduras, where she is still believed to be living. She was not treated as a suspect in the case. Echoes: The case bears similarities to that of back-from-the-dead John .

"Fifty years after her husband became one of the most reviled men in American history Marina Porter has revealed she is convinced Lee Harvey Oswald was not responsible for killing President John F Kennedy. Half a century after a gunshot rang out and rendered her a widow with two young children to care for, the now 72-year-old has seen in public, stepping out to shop in Walmart. Since her husband - a Soviet defector - was named the man responsible for assassinating JFK, Russian-born Marina has lived a quiet life behind closed doors, hiding away from suspicious eyes. Marina Oswald Porter, widow of Lee Harvey Oswald who assassinated JFK, told a press conference in 1977: 'I believe that Lee acted alone in this murder and shot the President , ironically a man whom he respected and admired'. She now no longer believes he killed the president . Gripped by fear and facing accusations from those who believe she was a co-conspirator in a KGB plot, the grandmother has lived in Rockwall, Texas since the mid-1970s with her second husband Kenneth Porter and three children. But as the 50th anniversary of the tragedy approaches the now 72-year-old has emerged from her inconspicuous life. Mrs Porter, is said to be struggling through a life blighted by illness, made worse by the impending 50th anniversary and the inevitable media frenzy which will ensue. Immediately after the assassination the then mother-of-two told the Warren Commission investigating the assassination that she thought her 24-year-old husband was guilty of shooting the president. But as the 50th anniversary looms, sources have revealed, the mother-of-three has, after reading 40,000 books and conspiracy theories about the shooting, she has changed her mind. She now believes, along with the majority of American citizens, that a more complex cover up led to the shooting of the beloved president. Close friend and documentary film maker Keya Morgan, said she now believes her husband was set up to take the fall for conspirators in the CIA and Mafia. The 72-year-old is said to be convinced her phones are still tapped by the Secret Service and lives in fear of being targeted and killed by spooks herself. Marina Oswald weeps as she views the body of her husband and JFK assassin Lee Harvey Oswald shortly before burial on November 25, 1963. She is holding her 22-month-old daughter June . Lee Harvey Oswald, his wife Marina, and his daughter June Lee, when they lived in Minsk in the USSR, shortly before they moved to the U.S. Mr Morgan told the Daily Mirror: 'She has spent half a century fearing for her own life. 'The . anniversary is a constant reminder of what happened. Her life now is . like a terrifying episode of the Twilight Zone, where every day she is . forced to answer the same question about the most traumatic moment of . her life. 'She is terrified of what might happen to her if she allowed herself to be thrust back into the limelight.' He . said he fears the 50th anniversary bandwagon is seriously damaging her . health - causing her to develop an immune deficiency disorder from the . stress. Marina, a Russian immigrant to the U.S., was living apart from Oswald when he shot dead President Kennedy on November 22, 1963. The night before the assassination she remembers him bringing his rifle to her home and putting it in the garage. The next day, she noticed it was gone. Due to her relationship with Oswald, Marina found herself the focus of intense scrutiny, so has spent many years hidden away in the small town, where a sign at the end of her driveway warns to 'Keep Out'. Two years after the JFK assassination, Marina married Kenneth Porter and they moved to Texas around ten years later. The family settled in Rockwall just 20 miles from Dallas. Assassin's ring: A wedding band worn by Lee Harvey Oswald until just hours before he killed President John F. Kennedy was sold at auction this month for $108,000 . She has two daughters by Oswald - June and Rachel - who confirmed to the National Enquirer that Marina does believe their father was innocent of the shooting and just a patsy for the Mafia and CIA. The Porters also have a son called Mark. The 72-year-old Mrs Porter has changed her mind about Oswald's guilt, according to the report, after reading books and watching documentaries on the assassination which has been mired in conspiracy theories for decades. Mr Morgan, told the Enquirer: 'She certainly doesn't believe the official story - she always told me Lee Harvey Oswald loved President Kennedy. Banded together: Oswald is pictured wearing his wedding band as he and wife Marina leave Belarus in the early sixties for America. It sold for $108,000 at auction earlier this month . 'Marina says she remembers the day the Kennedys' premature baby Patrick died (August 7, 1963) and she found Lee sobbing.' Despite her change of heart over Oswald, Mrs Porter's neighbors in Rockwall told the National Enquirer that she is a much-loved member of the local community. Fred McCurley, who lives nearby, told the Enquirer: 'She and Ken are good people, the  best neighbors you could ever have.' In . July, Mrs Porter announced that she putting his wedding ring up for . auction as she breaks the final ties to what she describes as the 'worst . day of my life'. She had . given the band up to be auctioned in New Hampshire after it was returned . to her following 50 years lost in an attorney's folder of legal papers . from the trial. The ring sold to an anonymous Texas bidder on October 24 for $108,000. It is accompanied by a fascinating letter written by Mrs Porter which gives the background to the historical object. Previous life: Lee Harvey Oswald, his wife Marina and their daughter June Lee in 1962 . Fateful day: A snapshot taken of the moment JFK was shot in the head in 1963 while driving through Dallas, Texas . President and Jacqueline Kennedy arrive at Dallas Love Field a few hours before he was killed by a sniper, Lee Harvey Oswald . It is widely believed that Oswald shot three bullets from his rifle. One missed entirely, a second hit Kennedy and passed through Governor Connally, the third was the fatal shot to the President. Through FBI testing it was established the gun could be fired by an experienced shooter three times within five to eight seconds. But in Governor Connally's own words: 'There were either two or three people involved, or more, in this — or someone was shooting with an automatic rifle.' The politician's wife believed that her husband was hit by a bullet that was separate from the two that hit Kennedy. In the Zapruder film, the JFK's head appears to move backwards after the last, fatal shot, an indication to some that a bullet was fired from the front. There have been witness statements that two men were seen on top of a grassy knoll to the west of the Texas School Book Depository before the shooting. A small section reads: 'At this time of my life, I don’t . wish to have Lee’s ring in my possession because symbolicly [sic] I want . to let go of my past that is connecting with Nov. 22, 1963.' Mrs Porter will keep the proceeds from the sale. In the letter she writes that the ring, which has a . tiny engraving of a hammer and sickle, was bought by Oswald in Minsk in . 1961 shortly before the couple returned to the U.S. The ring was left on the couple's bedside table when Oswald set out to kill the President. Oswald was himself later shot and killed by Dallas nightclub owner Jack Ruby while in police custody. She had refused to speak publicly as the 50th anniversary of President Kennedy's assassination approaches. The wedding band was discovered in 2004 stuck in a manila folder at a Forth Worth law firm. It was among the papers of Forrest Markward, a lawyer who represented Mrs Porter following the Kennedy assassination. After several years of legal tussles, the ring was returned by post to Mrs Porter in an envelope marked 'Treasury Department Secret Service'.

"No details: Guerrero state Gov. Angel Aguirre gave no details about the DNA of the 28 bodies that were uncovered in clandestine graves last week . The governor of the southern Mexico state where 43 college students disappeared said Saturday that some of the bodies recovered from clandestine graves last weekend did not match the missing students. Guerrero state Gov. Angel Aguirre gave no details about the DNA of the 28 bodies that were uncovered in clandestine graves last week. CBS News reports that the remains were severely burned and DNA tests are being conducted to identify the dead. On Sept. 26, 43 local students were taken, but not as a result of organized crime -- they were taken by local police officers. Authorities say that officers rounded up the students who had visited the city from their rural college in Ayotzinapa to solicit donations and drove off with them after two shooting incidents in Iguala in which police gunfire killed six people and left 25 wounded. Investigators say that a video showed police taking an undetermined number of students from the city after the violence, according to ABC 7. Yahoo News reports that the officers are believed to have turned the students over to a local drug gang that had ties to Iguala's fugitive mayor, Jose Luis Abarca. Few students escaped. ABC 7 reports that a person taken into custody told authorities that 17 students were taken to a mass grave site outside of Iguala and killed.

More than two weeks after the students' disappearance, 34 arrests have been made in the case including 26 Iguala police officers. Four of the suspects led investigators to four mass graves near the site where the 28 bodies were found. Karam declined to confirm or dispute the governor's claim that the uncovered bodies did not match those of the students. He stated that experts 'have not finished testing.'

"Most people enjoy a good hug and now scientists think that the ‘cuddle hormone’ could one day be used to slow muscle wasting, boost bone health and even combat obesity. Hugs prompt the body to produce ample amounts of the hormone oxytocin, which is released in response to physical touch and repairs muscle. The hormone is presently used to induce labour in pregnant women but it could be put to new use in slowing down sarcopenia – or muscle wasting - in the elderly, a new study claims. Hugging (pictured) releases the 'cuddle hormone' oxytocin and scientists think it could be used to slow muscle wasting, boost bone health and even combat obesity . Oxytocin is released in response to physical touch and is associated with maternal nurturing, social attachments, childbirth and sex. It is essential for healthy muscle maintenance and repair. The hormone is injected to induce labour and a new study claims it could one day be used to slow down muscle wasting in the elderly. Research has shown so far that it does not cause cancer when injected and could help old people recover from muscle injuries faster. Levels of oxytocin are high in children, but it is not known when levels of the hormone start to decline and how much is needed to maintain healthy tissues. Previous research found that administering oxytocin helped prevent the development of osteoporosis in mice. Oxytocin is associated with maternal nurturing, social attachments, childbirth and sex is essential for healthy muscle maintenance and repair. Research has found that unlike other treatments for muscle wasting, the hormone does not cause cancer and when injected, it could help old  people recover from muscle injuries faster. ‘Unfortunately, most of the molecules discovered so far to boost tissue regeneration are also associated with cancer, limiting their potential as treatments for humans,' said Irina Conboy, associate professor of bioengineering at the University of California, Berkeley. ‘Our quest is to find a molecule that not only rejuvenates old muscle and other tissue, but that can do so sustainably long-term without increasing the risk of cancer.’ The study, which was published in the journal Nature Communications, found that oxytocin, which is secreted into the blood by the brain’s pituitary gland, is a good candidate as it reaches every organ and is not known to be associated with tumours or to interfere with the immune system. Research has found unlike other treatments for muscle wasting, oxytocin (the molecular model is pictured) did not cause cancer and when injected, helped old people recover from muscle injuries faster . Levels of oxytocin are high in children, but it is not known when levels of the hormone start to decline in later life and how much is needed to maintain healthy tissues. Previous research found that administering oxytocin helped prevent the development of osteoporosis in mice. The new research also involved mice and found that blood levels of oxytocin declined with age and there were fewer receptors for oxytocin in muscle stem cells in older mice. To determine its role in muscle repair, the hormone was injected under the skin of old mice for nine days. While testing is currently on mice, scientists think that the hormone could be used to speed up the repair of muscle damage (illustrated) in older people . The scientists found that the muscles of the mice that had received oxytocin injections healed far better than those of a control group of mice without oxytocin. Researcher Dr Christian Elabd said: ‘The action of oxytocin was fast. The repair of muscle in the old mice was at about 80 per cent of what we saw in the young mice.’ However, the muscles of young mice given the extra boost of oxytocin did not regenerate especially quickly, leading researchers to believe it ‘boosts aged tissue stem cells without making muscle stem cells divide uncontrollably.’ The researchers also found that blocking the effects of oxytocin in young mice rapidly compromised their ability to repair muscle, which resembled old tissue after an injury. They also studied mice whose gene for oxytocin was disabled and those left unaltered.  At a young age, there was no significant difference between the two groups in muscle mass or repair efficiency after an injury. It wasn’t until the mice with the disabled oxytocin gene reached adulthood that signs of premature ageing began to appear. Professor Conboy said: ‘When disabling other types of genes associated with tissue repair, defects appear right away either during embryonic development, or early in life. ‘To our knowledge, the oxytocin gene is the only one whose impact is seen later in life, suggesting that its role is closely linked to the ageing process.’ Further research is planned to examine oxytocin’s role in extending a healthy life in animals and in conserving its beneficial anti-ageing effects in humans. A growing number of scientists believe that ageing is the underlying cause of a number of chronic diseases, including Parkinson’s and Type 2 diabetes. ‘If you target processes associated with ageing, you may be tackling those diseases at the same time,’ Professor Conboy said. Further research is planned to examine oxytocin's role in extending a healthy life in animals and in conserving its beneficial anti-ageing effects in humans. A growing circle of scientists believe that ageing is the underlying cause of a number of chronic diseases, including Parkinson's and Type 2 diabetes (illustrated)","Scientists at the University of California, Berkeley, believe that the 'cuddle hormone ' oxytocin could help old people recover from muscle injuries faster .

"The world's biggest tobacco firms are pouring millions into electronic cigarette advertising, bringing back the cigarette commercials that were banned in the 1990s. Tobacco companies have already spent £11.5million advertising 'smoking deterrent products' in the UK this year - including e-cigarettes and nicotine patches - beating last year's £13.6million record. And the total figure since 2009 amounts to a staggering £60million, according to market research company Nielsen. Scroll down for video . Glamorous: Stephen Dorff fronts a campaign for BluCigs promoting e-cigarettes . Sales of electronic cigarettes have risen tenfold in the last year, labelled as a 'healthy' alternative to smoking and promoted by celebrities who have taken them up. Existing advertising rules ban tobacco products from being promoted, but there are no rules against depicting cigarettes. British American Tobacco, the maker of Lucky Strike and Benson & Hedges, was the first tobacco company to launch an e-cigarette in Britain in July, and Philip Morris International, the world’s biggest tobacco company, is due to launch e-cigarette soon. Imperial Tobacco, the maker of Davidoff, has an electronic cigarette coming out next year. Around 1.3million Britons have taken up 'vaping' - inhaling nicotine vapours given out by the battery-powered plastic devices, which contain liquid nicotine. That figure is up from 700,000 last year - and sales of the fake fags are predicted to rise to £193million by the end of the year and £339million annually, Nielsen said. The devices not due to be regulated . as medicines until 2016, and health experts are concerned that they could glamourise smoking again after decades of fighting to cut smoking rates. Breathe in... Jenny McCarthy, former Playboy model, is also the face of a BluCigs campaign . ...And out: There is no concrete evidence to suggest e-cigarettes are dangerous, but health experts are concerned . Prices typically range from £7 to £60 and the devices come in flavours such as blueberry and chocolate. Analysts at Canaccord Genuity, the investment bank, expect them to be the 'most significant development in the history of the organised tobacco industry'. The existing tobacco business is worth £450 billion, and big tobacco companies companies in the United States have made television advertisements using Jenny McCarthy, a former Playboy model, and actor Stephen Dorff. And e-cigarette campaigns have already come to UK TV screens, with actor and Strictly Come Dancing contestant Mark Benton fronting a £600,000 ad for the E-Lites brand. Gamucci brand plans to raise £200 million from investors partly to fund an advertising blitz in 2014. BAT uses social media, such as Twitter and Facebook, and attractive young people tour cities promoting its smoking devices from cars with Vype branding. Philippe Zell, director of sales and marketing at Nicoventures - owned by BAT, which is using Facebook and Twitter to promote its devices - said that the company 'will be ramping up our presence'. Advertising spending on e-cigarettes and . other smoking materials and accessories went from £1.7 million in 2010 . to £13.1 million last year, according to Kantar Media. Shane MacGuill, a tobacco industry analyst at Euromonitor, says BAT is likely to advertise on television using 'modest, vague and after the watershed' tactics. Tobacco advertising was banned in cinemas in 1986, while cigars and loose tobacco were banned from television commercials in the early 1990s. Cool? Analysts say that if cigarettes appear on TV again, it could undo years of anti-smoking campaigning . And while there is no concrete proof that the e-cigarettes are damaging to health, New York's mayor Michael Bloomberg has said he wants to rid his city of both real cigarettes and the electronic alternative. Recently leaked drafts of three tobacco-related bills that are expected to be introduced into the City Council indicate that Bloomberg's planning to regulate e-cigs into extinction. Sales of e-cigarettes are already banned in Norway, Singapore and Brazil, among others, and France is set to impose the same restrictions on ecigs as on regular smokes.","Tobacco firms spend £11.5million on e-cigarette advertising in UK this year .

"A woman tending to her 3-year-old daughter and infant son last week was ruthlessly attacked by a home invader and the shocking beating was caught on a nanny cam. An unidentified man repeatedly kicked and punched the terrified mom, all while her 3-year-old daughter watched and an infant boy slept upstairs in the Millburn, New Jersey home. The woman and her daughter were watching morning cartoons on the couch when a man kicked in their front bolted door and immediately began to savagely attack the helpless mother. Scroll down for video... Otherwise quiet: A home invader in Millburn, New Jersey savagely beat a mother as her daughter, 3, watched and the footage was all caught on nanny cam Friday morning . A baby’s photograph can be seen hanging from the wall above the home’s staircase in video of the incident. It was, by all appearances, the home of a happy, growing family. But their foundations have been shaken. The comfortable, tree-lined neighborhood now worries for its safety as the intruder remains at large. And that includes its children.

As the woman’s little girl—seen blurred in the footage—watched her mother being kicked over a dozen times, video shows the attacker turn and speak to her. At a point, the invader seems to make physical contact with the child, but she was not injured. The robber made off with an undetermined amount of jewelry, according to NBC News. But not before shoving his victim down the basement stairs. She was taken to the hospital and treated for a concussion and extensive bruising on her face and body. Her husband was at work in New York City when the invasion took place. Lasting: The attack occurred Friday morning while the woman's husband was at work in New York City.

"A Muslim woman was reportedly told to remove her headscarf before a Canadian judge would hear her case. Judge Eliana Marengo was said to have told Rania El-Alloul that the courtroom in Montreal is a secular place and she was not suitably dressed. 'Hats and sunglasses for example, are not allowed. And I don't see why scarves on the head would be either,' it was claimed she said in a recording of proceedings, according to CBC News. Rania El-Alloul was reportedly told to remove her headscarf by a judge before she would hear her case in Montreal . El-Allouk had attended court in a bid to have her car returned after it was seized by police. Her son was reported to have been driving the vehicle with a suspended licence when he was stopped and it was confiscated by Quebec's automobile insurance board. The car was due to be kept for a month, but El-Allouk wanted the court to return it sooner, according to the broadcaster. After the hearing she was said to have felt scared and 'not Canadian anymore,' CBC reported. Her case was said to have been adjourned indefinitely. Quebec's Ministry of Justice did not immediately respond after business hours to a request for comment on the case. Judge Marengo could also not be reached for comment. The incident was claimed to have happened in a courtroom in Montreal, Canada. Pictured: Montreal . The public display of religious symbols has been hotly debated in the predominantly French-speaking Canadian province in recent years. In 2013, the pro-independence Parti Quebecois (PQ) government moved to ban public servants from wearing Muslim head coverings such as hijabs, Jewish skullcaps or other obvious religious symbols. But the bill died when the PQ was defeated in a provincial election last year.","Rania El-Alloul was applying to Montreal court to have her car returned .

"A mother who spent 23 years on death row before an appeal court threw out her murder conviction is to be released pending retrial, MailOnline can reveal today. Debra Milke was found guilty of playing a part in the murder of her four-year-old son Christopher in 1989. But in a decision handed down today Maricopa County Superior Court Judge Rosa Vroz agreed with the appeal court’s opinion that ‘the only direct evidence’ linking defendant, Debra Milke, to the crime was her confession to  Detective Armando Saldate Jr. Milke’s conviction was dramatically overturned in March when it emerged that the State had knowingly withheld evidence that lead detective, Armando Saldate, Jr, ‘lied under oath and trampled the constitutional rights of suspects.’ Mother love? Debra Milke pictured with her son Christopher, killed at the age of 4. Prosecutors portrayed her a callous murderer convicted by her own 'confession' Life Sentence: Debra Milke, now 49, has spent 23 years of her life on Death Row for the murder she maintains she did not commit . Attorneys for Milke last week urged Judge Vroz to set Milke’s bond at $50,000. Today the judge ordered the bond to be set at $250,000 and placed various conditions on Milke’s release. Milke will be electronically monitored . and must have no contact with Arizona Milke – her former husband and . Christopher’s father. Milke’s conviction was sensationally . overturned in March. Then, Chief Judge Alex Kozinski wrote in his damning . conclusion that: ‘The Phoenix Police Department and Saldate’s . supervisors there should be ashamed of having given free rein to a . lawless cop to misbehave again and again, undermining the integrity of . the sytem they were sworn to uphold.’ The original trial, where Milke . convicted and sentence to death, was - according to Judge Kozinski - . ‘essentially a swearing context between Milke and Phoenix Police . Detective Armando Saldate, Jr.’ Judge Vroz reiterated the 9th US . Circuit Court of Appeals’s findings in March and noted that ‘serious . doubts on the validity of the Defendant’s alleged confession.’ There was no physical evidence . connecting Milke to the crime and no corroborating testimony. The . State’s case depended entirely on a confession extracted by Detective . Armando Saldate, Jr. Milke has consistently denied the . confession which was neither witnessed nor recorded. Saldate’s notes . were not submitted at trial. Final Days: Milke's mother, Renate Janka was diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2010 and may not have long to live . Yet, Judge Kozinski observed: ‘The . judge and jury believed Saldate…they didn’t know about Saldate’s long . history of lying under oath and other misconduct. The state knew…but . didn’t disclose it.’ A Willing Walk to Death: Christopher trusted the men who told him he was going to see Santa Claus but abducted and shot him dead . With barely concealed outrage Judge . Kozinski added: ‘No civilized system of justice should have to depend on . such flimsy evidence, quite possibly tainted by dishonesty or . overzealousness, to decide whether to take someone’s life or liberty.’ State attorney Vince Imorbino last . week pressed the court to deny bond on the grounds that the evidence was . ‘no different now’ than on the day of Milke’s conviction 23 years ago. If granted at all ,Mr Imbordino requested the court set Milke’s bond at . $5million. Judge Vroz disagreed and stated that ‘much had transpired since the original trial.’ Attorneys for Milke urged the court to . set a low bond, pressing the case that her mother, Renate Janka is now . terminally ill with cancer. In a statement seen by MailOnline and . submitted by Mrs Janka, to Maricopa County Court, she said: ‘In view of . Judge Kozinski’s Opnion, it becomes less and less bearable what the . State of AZ is putting us through. ‘For Debbie and I it is a constant mental stress between time left and utmost fear.’ Mrs Janka received the ‘devastating’ diagnosis of third stage Ovarian Cancer in June 2010. She underwent . aggressive surgery and chemotherapy but Mrs Janka’s condition is . terminal. Now living in Switzerland, Mrs Janka . told of her agony as, two months ago, ‘my phone calls to Debra were . cancelled without explanation. 'Then I was told not to write letters . (only postcards), not to mention what the next few weeks will bring us.’ Christopher Milke, 4, begged his mother to take hiim to the mall to see Santa Claus, instead she sent him with James Styers and sent him to his death . Convicted Killers: James Styers, left, and Roger Scott, right are both facing lethal injection for their crime . Judge Kozinski has set aside not only the conviction but has also barred the use of the 'so-called confession.' The facts of the case, such as they . were known, were enough to shock America. On the last evening of his . life, Chrisopher Milke saw Santa Claus at the mall near the home in . Phoenix he shared with his mother and her room-mate James Styers. He enjoyed it so much he woke the next . morning and begged his mother to take him again. Milke, then 25, agreed . but asked Styers to take him instead. On the way Styers picked up his friend . Roger Scott. The two men drove the boy to a secluded ravine where . Styers shot Christopher three times in the head. Both Styers and Scott are currently on death row awaiting lethal injection for their part in the killing. In the immediate aftermath Scott . implicated Milke. He claimed the three had plotted Chrisopher’s killing . and planned to split his $50,000 life insurance. Corrupt Witness: Phoenix Police Detective Armando Saldate 'lied under oath and trampled over suspects rights,' and his testimony convicted Debra Milke . Christopher's family mourn where the little boy was shot and his body abandoned . If Looks Could Kill: Prosecutors argued that Milke murdered her son because of his resemblance to his father, the ex-husband she loathed, Mike 'Arizona' Milke, above left . Much was made in trial of Milke’s . hatred for Christopher’s father, her ex-husband, Mark ‘Arizona’ Milke . and Christopher’s striking physical resemblance to him. But neither of Milke’s co-accused took . the stand at the original trial. Styers has vociferously maintained . that Milke had nothing to do with the killing that shocked America, while . Scott recanted his earlier claims. Speaking to MailOnline, Milke’s . Phoenix based attorney, Michael Kimerer said: ‘We have learned from . various sources that Styers and Scott continue to maintain that Milke . had nothing to do with the killing.’ Both men, he said, have the added . incentive of having their death penalties reduced to life sentences if . they turn State witnesses.  Yet both continue to maintain Milke’s . innocence. Milke’s retrial will start on 30 September.","Debra Milke was convicted of plotting the murder of son Christopher, 4, two decades ago .

"Laws safeguarding journalists’ sources must be strengthened to prevent ‘snooping’ by the police, Nick Clegg said yesterday. He said he was ‘concerned’ by recent cases in which detectives used powers to spy on reporters and obtain details of their sources ‘without clear justification’. The Deputy Prime Minister called for journalists to be given a wider public interest defence if charged with breaking the law in pursuit of a story, saying it was ‘incredibly important in a free society’. Protection: Laws protecting journalists’ sources must be strengthened to prevent ‘snooping’, Nick Clegg said . Revelations that police used the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act (Ripa) to access details of reporters’ phone conversations sparked calls for reform. Speaking at a press conference in London yesterday, Mr Clegg said the law should be changed to require the use of Ripa powers to reveal journalists’ sources to be signed off by a judge. Asked about recent cases, Mr Clegg replied: ‘I am concerned about this. It is incredibly important in a free society that journalists should be able to go after information where there’s a clear public interest to do so without fear that they will be snooped upon or have their files rifled through without clear justification.’ He went on: ‘Where the police ask you (a journalist) for information which might reveal your sources – privileged information – that shouldn’t be done on the say so of a police officer, even a senior police officer. That should only be done on the say so of a judge. 'It is a big thing to say to the Press in this country: “We can demand to know where you got your information from and we don’ t even need to go to a judge to do so.” That needs to change.’ Police used the powers against the Mail on Sunday as part of its inquiry into Constance Briscoe (above) Mr Clegg also signalled unease over the large number of current prosecutions against journalists. Existing laws provide reporters with only a limited defence that the story they were pursuing was in the public interest. Mr Clegg said this defence should now be enshrined in law, with amendments made to a number of major pieces of legislation to make it clear that there are circumstances where journalists can legitimately break the law in pursuit of a story. ‘There should be a public interest defence put in law - you would probably need to put it in the Data Protection Act, the Bribery Act, maybe one or two other laws as well - where you enshrine a public interest defence for the press so that where you are going after information and you are being challenged, you can set out a public interest defence to do so,’ he said. Mr Clegg also called yesterday for jail terms for anyone found guilty of large-scale data theft. ‘The penalties that exist at the moment are pathetic - a small rap over the knuckles and a £100 fine. There should be a custodial sentence attached to major data theft.’ Recent concern has focused on four cases in which it emerged that police forces used Ripa to spy on journalists. In three cases, the powers were used to seize phone records, despite the journalists involved not being suspected of breaking the law. In one case involving the Mail on Sunday, the phone records of two journalists were seized as part of an inquiry into allegations that Constance Briscoe, a former judge, had misled the police. Home Secretary Theresa May has promised to publish a revised code ‘to make clear that specific consideration must be given to communications data requests involving those in sensitive professions, such as journalists’. But Mark Rowley, assistant commissioner at the Metropolitan Police, has defended the practice, saying ‘nobody should be above the law’. Speaking mast week, Mr Rowley said: ‘We will keep using the powers to chase down criminals whether they are ordinary members of the public or journalists.’","Mr Clegg voiced concern over powers used to expose confidential sources .
He said recent examples show incidents do not have a 'clear justification'

"The potentially massive impact of fracking on house prices was revealed yesterday – with one woman saying the value of her home has been cut by £535,000. Dianne Westgarth told how the price of her five-bedroom house had plummeted by over 70 per cent as a result of a proposed fracking site nearby. In 2012, the property – which comes with two-and-a-half acres of land – was valued at £725,000. Dianne Westgarth said the price of her five-bedroom house on the Fylde peninsula in Lancashire - just 300 yards from a site where a drilling firm wants to start fracking - had dropped by 70 per cent . ‘The new valuation came in at £190,000,’ she said. ‘Two other estate agents said they would rather not even comment, because the possibility of fracking meant they couldn’t actually say if it was worth anything at all.’ The divorced 53-year-old wants to downsize in preparation for her sons, aged 17 and 21, finishing their education. Her house is on the Fylde peninsula in Lancashire – just 300 yards from a site where drilling firm Cuadrilla wants to start fracking. ‘I’m directing all my efforts at ensuring the site near my home doesn’t get permission,’ she added. ‘Currently, my house is worth next to nothing.’ She spoke out as it emerged that the Valuation Office Agency (VOA) – which values properties for council tax – had admitted that commercial activities such as fracking could cause their estimates to be downgraded. ‘If you have a wind farm or other development built near your house it can have a significant impact on the value of your property,’ a spokesman told The Sunday Times. ‘Fracking is not widespread yet but if a new site had a knock-on effect on the value of the house then it could also affect the council tax banding.’ Supporters of shale drilling claim it could revolutionise Britain’s energy supply, with trillions of cubic feet of gas said to lie beneath Lancashire. But the detrimental effect experienced by Mrs Westgarth has been echoed elsewhere. James Nisbet, who lives near another potential drilling site near Blackpool, said a would-be purchaser pulled out of buying his £375,000 house after hearing about the plan. Cuadrilla wants to start fracking on the nearby site. Supports claim it could revolutionise Britain's energy supply, but several homeowners are feeling the detrimental effects of the proposals . ‘I’ve been a Conservative voter since I was 18,’ he said. ‘I’m now 60 but it’s the last time I will vote Conservative because they have sold Lancashire down the swanny with no regard for people’s health and well-being.’ Similar fears have been expressed further south at Fernhurst in West Sussex, where another fracking proposal has been lodged. Chris Hebert, of Hamptons estate agency in nearby Haslemere, said: ‘If someone’s got something going on 24/7, people will not buy their house.’ The revelations come just weeks after the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs was accused of a fracking ‘cover-up’ after it censored a key report on the topic no less than 63 times in 13 pages. The chapter examining the effect of drilling on house prices had three sections redacted – although it did acknowledge a study which found the value of properties near a well in Texas had fallen by up to 14 per cent. However both the VOA and the Department for Energy and Climate Change (DECC) yesterday insisted there was no evidence to link fracking with falling house prices. ‘There is no evidence that house prices have been affected in over half a century of oil and gas exploration in the UK or evidence that this would be the case with shale,’ a spokesman for the DECC said. ‘This Government believes that shale has a positive part to play in our future energy mix, providing energy security, driving growth and creating jobs.’ A spokesman for VOA said: ‘Every case is different and each... value change is assessed on its own merits.'","Dianna Westgarth said the price of her house had dropped by 70 per cent .

"A pre-op male transsexual has been sent to one of Britain's most notorious all-female prisons after robbing a man and attacking three police officers. Katelyn Findlay, 18, who was born Stuart Kelly, is being held at Cornton Vale prison near Stirling, which in recent years was officially Scotland's most violent jail. Findlay was sent to the female-only institution . because she has been actively living as a woman - but has not physically started the sex change process. Controversial: Katelyn Kelly, who was born Stuart Kelly, has been sent to an all-female prison after she has admitted robbing a man and assaulting police . Jail: Cornton Vale women's prison in Stirling, which became notorious for violence in Scotland . Two years ago it was revealed Cornton Vale had more fights and assaults per prisoner than any male jail north of the border. The teenager, of Airdrie, Lanarkshire, was born male but has been dressing as a woman for at least two years and is hoping to have a sex-change operation. She was sentenced to six months in prison at Airdrie Sheriff Court after already having spent a month at the prison on remand. Her solicitor Robin White told the court she had experienced a 'difficult' time in the jail because she was a transsexual and was desperate not to go back there. But the court refused to the request because of the seriousness of her crime. Trouble: The pre-op transsexual has been held on remand in the same prison but has had a 'difficult tine', her legal team said . Life: Katelyn has not officially started the sex change process, however, she has been dressing as a woman for two years . 'This is her first time in custody and it's an experience which has not been particularly good for her,' Mr White said. 'She has had a very difficult time in Cornton Vale given her present circumstances and it's not a situation she wants to find herself in again. 'Her lifestyle has been extremely chaotic and she has suffered difficulties in her social life. 'She does not want to go back to Cornton Vale.' Criminal: The teenager, pictured outside her local Co-op in Lanarkshire, is hoping to have a sex-change . However, Sheriff Dickson said there was no alternative to custody as Findlay had been an 'active participant' in a robbery. She admitted robbing David Aitken of house keys and a mobile phone sim card at an address in Airdrie on April 12. She also admitted resisting arrest and shouting, swearing, spitting at and violently struggling with three police constables on the same date. Sitting in the dock, Findlay wore no make up and had her hair tied in a bun. A prison source said: 'She is being held at Cornton Vale because she insists she is a woman. 'However she is actually still a man and it has caused quite a stir. 'Staff are having to refer to her as Katelyn and she is being recognised as a female.' Findlay's Facebook page is littered with suggestive comments from men and she refers to herself as a single female. She has uploaded over 300 pictures of herself posing as a woman and posted that she 'needed a boyfriend.' Colin MacFarlane, director of Stonewall Scotland, who campaign for transgender equality, said: 'We would expect Cornton Vale prison to act very sensitively with this issue. 'A person who is transsexual does not need to have any surgery to obtain a gender recognition certificate and be recognised legally in their acquired gender.' A Scottish Prison Service spokesman said: 'We cannot comment on individual inmates. 'The Scottish Prison Service has established policies in place for such occasions.'","Katelyn Findlay, whose real name is Stuart, is being held at Cornton Vale jail .

"A grandmother was left with horrific cuts and bruises to her face and neck after new tiling created an optical illusion that hid a trip hazard. The new paving in Pontypridd, South Wales, has been blamed for a spate of falls after more than 20 shoppers were taken to hospital. The patterned tiles, part of a £10.5million town centre makeover, has created a hidden trap for many unable to spot the edge of the kerb. Treacherous trip hazard: Morfydd Jenkins, 75, suffered horrific cuts and bruises to her face and neck after tripping on new tiles in the Pontypridd town centre which created an optical illusion . Grandmother Morfydd Jenkins, 75, was left badly bruised when she fell over on the tiles while rushing to get a bus. She said: ‘I was going to the bus stop and all I remember is falling over the kerb - I didn’t see it. ‘I was taken to hospital and had X-rays and I had a lot of bruising and cuts to my face and neck. ‘I’m feeling alright now but I’m much more cautious about going out on my own.’ The tile pattern at street level is . very similar to the loading bay - four inches below - and many pedestrians are . unable to see the drop. Can you see the kerb? The new tiles (pictured) have created an optical illusion, hiding the edge of the kerb on Taff Street . Optical illusion: This is the kerb after the redesign, blamed for the spate of falls. It is four inches above ground level and on a slight slope . Before the revamp: On the left is the spot before the £10.5m revamp of the town centre. The revamp was completed in May and aimed to make the town safer . The Welsh Ambulance Service said it had been called to the spot 20 times since the redesign was completed in May. Cheryl . Hull, manager of Shaws the Drapers, works opposite the paving stones . and has already called an ambulance for around 10 shoppers. She said: ‘The regeneration made them the same colour and this is causing an optical illusion. ‘It tends to blend into one - some people see the edge of the kerb but others don’t. ‘Surely they can do something to try to highlight the pavement. At some angles it can look as if it’s all one level. ‘I think when older people are rushing for the bus, they might not see it, especially as their eyesight tends to be bad. Safety first: The new tiling has been blamed for a spate of falls after more than 20 shoppers have been taken to hospital . ‘And . at that age they fall quite heavily and some of the people I’ve helped . have been quite badly hurt. At that age, it can really be a big deal . too.’ Sarah Crumb, who works at Age Cymru directly across the road from the troublesome spot, has seen plenty of people fall. She said: ‘Obviously they’re mostly elderly people but I’ve seen some young people fall too. ‘It’s slightly sloped and even though the tiles are different shades, a lot of people say they can’t see the difference where the step is. Town revamp: The new tiling is part of a £10.5m makeover of the Pontypridd town centre . ‘Maybe it should be painted with a yellow line to make it stand out. It wouldn’t be as pretty but safety is more important.’ Rhondda Cynon Taf Council claimed the revamp, completed in May this year, had made the town centre safer. A spokesman said: ‘Accessibility throughout Pontypridd has been greatly improved due to the regeneration scheme. ‘Throughout the town improvements have been made with more accessible floor surfaces. ‘We have introduced flat surfaces where possible which greatly assists those with mobility issues. ‘There are some areas in the town that do require a kerb to ensure services such as buses and . deliveries to shops can continue to be provided.’ The council is yet to respond to Mail Online's request for comment on how they would deal with the safety issue.","More than 20 shoppers have been taken to hospital after tripping on the tiles .

"David Cameron let mounting criticism of his Cornish holiday wash over him today - by going body boarding. Opponents have accused the Prime Minister of complacency over the Iraq crisis and have publicly demanded that he return to Number 10 to get a grip on the developing crisis in Iraq. Mr Cameron only returned to Downing Street on Wednesday morning, following the brutal execution of hostage James Foley - but went back to the West Country just 19 hours later. Scroll down for video . Making waves: Prime Minister David Cameron clutches a body board enjoys the surf  in Cornwall . Drying off: The Prime Minister with a towel. He returned to his holiday after a 19-hour dash to Downing Street . Mr Cameron today appeared to put the stresses of high office to one side, by joining fellow holidaymakers riding the waves on a beach in Cornwall. It comes after the  Barack Obama sparked anger in the US after being pictured laughing with friends on a golf course just hours after describing the beheading of Mr Foley 'an act of violence that shocks the conscience of the entire world'. Images of Mr Cameron playing in the surf come amid mounting pressure for a recall of Parliament to deal with the growing threat of Islamic State insurgents sweeping through Iraq and Syria. In the latest developments, Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond, who has been left in charge of the situation while Mr Cameron is in Cornwall, last night ruled out a deal with Syria’s Bashar al-Assad – despite warnings it will be impossible to defeat Islamic State fanatics without his help. Dealing with the tyrant, who has killed tens of thousands of his people, would poison Britain’s wider diplomatic efforts in the Middle East, he said. ‘I’ve said very often that one of the first things you learn in the Middle East is that my enemy’s enemy is not necessarily my friend. ‘We may very well find that we are aligned against a common enemy, but that doesn’t make us friends. ‘It doesn’t make us able to trust them, it . doesn’t enable us to work with them. It would poison what we are trying . to achieve in separating moderate Sunni opinion from the poisonous . ideology of IS.’ Surfing safari: Cameron clutches his body board as he walks across the beach after time in the sea . Despite the protestations, some kind of deal might be reached,  with the Independent newspaper reporting that the US has already supplied Assad’s forces with intelligence about the location of jihadi leaders – allowing Syrian aircraft and artillery to target them. The newspaper claims the German intelligence service, the BND, had been used as a back channel for the communications. The Prime Minister returned to Downing Street for emergency meetings with the Foreign Secretary on Wednesday morning after a video was published online of the brutal beheading of Mr Foley by a jihadi thought to be British. Mr Cameron is believed to have ordered the security services to track down Mr Foley's British killers, but pledged not to offer a 'knee jerk' response to the murder. Speaking from Downing Street, Mr Cameron said: 'Let me condemn the barbaric and brutal act that has taken place and let's be clear what this act is - it is an act of murder, and murder without any justification.' Just 19 . hours later however Number 10 announced that Mr Cameron was on his way . back to Cornwall to join his third family holiday of the year - and his . fifteenth since becoming Prime Minister. Mr . Cameron today took to the water in a three quarter-length wet suit and . brightly-coloured bodyboard after hiring boards  from a local trader. An onlooker said: 'He seemed pretty relaxed and having a good time by himself. 'He . didn't do any real surfing - the conditions weren't really there for it . - but he had a go on the body board a couple of times. Wet and wild: Wet suit wearing Cameron turned a few heads as he strolled along the sand after a dip . The PM was pictured back on the beach hours after being accused of complacency over the Iraq crisis . Crashing the waves: Cameron decided to go back to his holiday instead of handling the crisis in Downing Street . 'The weather was pretty good - rather sunny - and he took full advantage of it.' Another onlooker said: 'He then walked down the beach and happily spent around 20 minutes body boarding in the sea. 'The waves were over a metre high so there was a bit of surf to play in. He seemed to really enjoy himself. After a while they all got out and walked back up the beach.' After the surf session Mr Cameron left in his security convoy. Government sources have insisted that he remains in full touch with Whitehall during his break with a secure phone line set up for his stay . But critics accused the Prime Minister of a dereliction of duty – and questioned why he has refused to recall Parliament to debate Mr Foley’s murder and the threat to security posed by jihadis who return to the UK. In the US, . President Obama faced similar criticism after he was pictured smiling on . the golf course within minutes of giving a speech condemning the . murder. Mr . Obama's decision to return to the golf course just hours after giving a . sombre five minute address over the killing of Mr Foley sparked fury in . the US. The . President told a global audience that 'when people harm Americans, . anywhere, we do what’s necessary to see that justice is done'. But . he was then seen laughing with friends and fist-bumping them during a . five-hour round at Farm Neck on Martha's Vineyard in Massachusetts. Retired . US Army Lieutenant Colonel Ralph Peters could hardly contain his anger . Wednesday night on the Fox News Channel as he discussed Obama's . reactions to the ISIS terror network's beheading of Foley, an American . who had been missing since 2012. 'There is no way the president should be stupid enough to go play golf' after such a somber speech, Peters said. Cameron's security team watched the PM from the beach while he enjoyed the surf for  20 minutes . 'Not only did he insult the Foley family; he sent a message to Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi (the leader of ISIS) and all of the other jihadi terrorist militants – now soldiers of a jihadi army – that he doesn't take it all seriously.' Labour MP Ann Clwyd, former British human rights envoy to Iraq, was equally furious about Mr Cameron's decision to return to his holiday in Britain. She said: ‘I just find it extraordinary that he has gone off on holiday again after a few hours back in London – it is just not good enough. 'If he is serious about the threat to Britain, as he says he is and as he ought to be, then he should not be pushing off on holiday. He should be recalling MPs to Parliament so that we can discuss the situation and debate our response.' Meanwhile, former Army chief Lord Dannatt, once a defence adviser to David Cameron, said the West would have to talk to Assad if it was serious about destroying IS. ‘The Syrian dimension has got to be addressed,’ he said. ‘You cannot deal with half a problem. Whether it is above the counter or below the counter, a conversation has got to be held with him.‘Because if there is going to be any question of air strikes over Syrian airspace it’s got to be with the Assad regime’s approval.’ He spoke as defence chiefs put the Cyprus-based Yorkshire Regiment on ‘high readiness’ to deploy to Baghdad, as special forces focus on identifying IS commanders and British recruits. Sun . and sand: But critics accused the Prime Minister of a dereliction of . duty and questioned why he has refused to recall Parliament to debate Mr . Foley’s murder and the threat to security posed by jihadis . In the US, chairman of the joint chiefs of staff Martin Dempsey said IS strongholds in Syria, as well as Iraq, would ‘have to be addressed’. US defence secretary Chuck Hagel said the extremist group was ‘beyond anything we have seen’ and suggested that strikes in Syria would be necessary to defeat them. But Mr Hammond was backed by Tory MP Rory Stewart, chairman of the Commons defence committee, who said: ‘I would be very, very cautious about seeing Assad as an ally. ‘He is completely unreliable and he may have his own reasons for wanting to keep IS in place in some form, because their presence relieves the pressure for regime change.’ Fellow Tory Nadhim Zahawi, who has just returned from northern Iraq, said: ‘The real issue, unpalatable as it is, is working with Iran, which holds much more sway in the region.’ However, former foreign secretary Sir Malcolm Rifkind said: ‘You cannot get rid of the Islamist terrorist in northern Iraq and allow them to have safe haven in Syria. ‘We are all determined to get rid of this ghastly Islamic caliphate state which carried out such savage acts of terrorism and which is such a threat. We’ve got to be serious about it and swallow hard as to what is required to do that.’ The Government is under growing pressure to reintroduce anti-terror control orders to stop radicalised Britons going overseas to fight or plotting attacks at home. Independent terror watchdog David Anderson QC, his predecessor Lord Carlile and MPs criticised the Coalition for axing control orders in 2011. These were replaced by weaker powers – T-Pims – which allowed terror suspects more freedom so as not to breach their human rights. But not a single person is currently covered by the measures, designed to protect the public from fanatics who cannot be jailed. A Home Office spokesman said: ‘We introduced T-Pims precisely because control orders were not working and their powers were being struck down by the courts. ‘People seeking to travel to engage in terrorist activity in Syria or Iraq should be in no doubt we will take the strongest possible action.’","The PM took time off dealing with Iraq crisis to go body boarding in Cornwall .

"One of Labour’s most senior figures defected to Ukip last night in protest at Ed Miliband’s refusal to hold a referendum on Europe. Harriet Yeo, a former chairman of Labour’s ruling National Executive Committee, quit in order to campaign for Nigel Farage’s party. Her departure is a major embarrassment for Labour, which has started a belated fightback against Ukip in recent months. Scroll down for video . Snookered! Ed Miliband pulls a series of faces after challenging children in Lincoln to a game of pool . Mrs Yeo served as chairman of the NEC, which runs the party, until 2013, and was leader of the Labour group on Ashford Borough Council in Kent. She is the most senior Labour figure to publicly back Ukip. In a further sign of Labour tensions on the issue, the party’s biggest donor warned that Mr Miliband’s refusal to hold a referendum on Europe will ‘inevitably weaken’ Britain’s chances of getting a better deal from Brussels. John Mills, who gave the party £1.65million in 2013, said ‘many in the Labour Party’ want Mr Miliband to abandon opposition to an in/out vote. Mrs Yeo could not be contacted for comment last night. But in a message on Twitter, her daughter Angharad – a former Ukip candidate – said: ‘Pleased that mummsy Caroline Yeo will be supporting Ukip in the 2015 election.’ Ukip also confirmed the defection. Nigel Farage said: ‘I’m delighted that Ukip can now count upon the support of such a respected figure as Harriet Yeo. ‘A life-long trade unionist and Labour Party member who served as chairman of Ed Miliband’s NEC, she is yet another voice calling for Britain to have a choice about its future. We are welcoming support from across the board and Harriet’s support is evidence of this.’ Game over: Ed Miliband at the centre in Lincoln yesterday, left, and Harriet Yeo, right, who defected to Ukip . In a speech on the economy on Monday, Mr Miliband appeared to rule out holding a referendum on Europe. ‘The real threat to prosperity after the general election would be to leave the European Union,’ he said. ‘Under a Labour government, Britain will be a strong and proud member of a reformed EU.’ Mr Mills, a long-time supporter of a referendum, will today be among the keynote speakers at a conference in London examining options for Britain outside the EU. Last night he said Mr Miliband’s hopes of reforming the EU would be seriously compromised by his opposition to a referendum. ‘If Ed Miliband becomes Prime Minister in May and renegotiates without committing to a referendum, he will inevitably weaken the UK’s bargaining position,’ he said. ‘Minds in Brussels are much more likely to take renegotiation seriously if they know that there is a substantial risk that the UK will leave the EU if there is not a satisfactory deal on the table to persuade the UK to stay in.’ Former Tory Cabinet minister Owen Paterson, who is also speaking at the conference organised by the Conservative MEP David Campbell Bannerman, will also make the most explicit call yet for Britain to leave the EU. He said last night Britain could become ‘really active, major players’. ‘I see a huge optimistic vision for this country, a really spectacular future, but to do it and to get there, we have to leave,’ he added. Labour sources claimed Mrs Yeo had lost her role in Ashford for non-attendance at meetings. A spokesman said: ‘The vast majority of the Labour Party are united behind our position on Europe, believing Britain’s best interests are served by staying in a reformed EU and not sleepwalking towards an exit which would cost jobs and influence.’ One of Britain’s leading businessmen has accused Ed Miliband of being a ‘card carrying Marxist’ who is unfit to govern. In the latest salvo from a captain of industry, Sir John Ritblat also accused the Labour leader of ‘learning nothing and forgetting everything’ from the financial crisis. Sir John, who bought British Land for £1million in 1970 and transformed it into one of the UK’s biggest property investment companies, voiced concerns that a Labour government would ‘pick up some of the flaws of the French economy’. He said: ‘I would simply say there is a problem when the leadership is obviously very inexperienced, has never been involved in commerce and whose family tradition is one of left wing, totally unreconstructed, card carrying Marxists. This is not a good basis for pragmatic government.’ The 79-year-old City grandee, who was responsible for transforming the skyline of London with the development of the giant Broadgate office complex, added: ‘This all adds to the impression that Mr Miliband is unfit to govern.’ Last night one of Britain’s leading fashion entrepreneurs also joined the backlash against Labour. Arguing Mr Miliband warrants his ‘Red Ed’ nickname, Harold Tillman – who previously owned British fashion chain Jaeger – said: ‘I am only just realising how socialist Miliband is. I am shocked at this, but Labour sound as if they want to stamp on aspiration.’ The criticism will be a blow to Labour, which this week slipped behind the Tories in the polls after a series of battles with big businesses.","Harriet Yeo is former chairman of Labour's National Executive Committee .

"They say two heads are better than one - but this horse seems to be taking the phrase quite literally! Photographer Geoffrey Baker, 57, was stunned when he checked out a snap he'd taken of a wild pony - but discovered it appeared to have grown a second head. Bird watcher Geoffrey, from Port Talbot, South Wales, had taken out his camera to capture rare birds on film. Optical illusion: Photographer Geoffrey Baker managed to snap what appeared to be a two-headed horse on a hill overlooking Three Cliffs bay on the Gower Peninsular . But after an unsuccessful day's twitching with a friend, Geoffrey turned his attentions to the ponies nearby. And more through luck than any design, he managed to capture he exact moment when one of the ponies turned, creating the striking optical illusion of a horse with two heads. It was not until Geoffrey looked at his camera's display that he realised how his split-second timing had caught the amazing image. He said: 'A friend had bought a two-man folding chair hide and he asked if I wanted to test it out with him, in an area of gorse up on the hill called 'Cefn Bryn' overlooking the beautiful Three Cliffs bay on the Gower Peninsular. Beauty spot: Geoffrey Baker was birdwatching on a hill overlooking the stunning Three Cliffs bay in Gower Peninsula near Swansea when he photographed the 'two-headed horse' 'I got up at 5am and we sat for hours waiting for some birds but only one landed all morning. 'We noticed some wild ponies in the distance so I put my 1.7x converter on my Nikon D3 and 200-400mm lens and took some shots. 'I saw one pony coming out from behind a bush so I waited and when it turned its head to look at us, I instinctively pressed the shutter button. 'When I then looked at it on my camera's LCD screen to check exposure, I noticed that there were in fact two horses side by side. 'I think my photo of a two-headed horse turned out to be better than any I could have taken of birds!' The optical illusion is created when the distance between the two horses is foreshortened by the telephoto lens used by Geoffrey. Over long distances, this effect causes the two subjects to appear much much closer than they really are.",Geoffrey Baker captured the striking optical illusion of two-headed horse while out birdwatching .
"Holster the young guns, the old fellas are not quite ready to step aside for the new wave of talent in men’s tennis. These Championships have seen the emerging prospects come close to cracking the superiority of the established quartet of Rafael Nadal, Novak Djokovic, Andy Murray and Roger Federer. The barometer will ultimately be a new name on one of the Grand Slam trophies or, at the very least, a final not contested by one of those four. Incredible: Roger Federer will play his 25th Slam final on Sunday . No major sport is more in need of new winners; no old guard is putting up more of a fight. In context, today’s meeting between Federer and Djokovic will be the 38th Slam final since one of the current ‘Big Four’ was not involved; in that time only two other men — Stanislas Wawrinka and Juan Martin del Potro — have crashed the gates of the winner’s circle. It is a situation that will change, naturally, but not quite yet, despite the charges of Grigor Dimitrov and Milos Raonic, both 23, to the Wimbledon semi-finals. Behind them, 19-year-old Nick Kyrgios and Kei Nishikori, 24, are part of a group taking large strides up the rankings, Kyrgios reaching the last eight and Nishikori already up to 12th in the world. It’s a slow passing of the torch but one, you can see, is already happening. Dimitrov, who battered Murray before running into Djokovic’s brick wall, put it best, saying: ‘We are already in that space, if you think about it. Quarters [Kyrgios], semis [Dimitrov, Raonic] — it’s just a matter of jumping over that next hurdle. We are all for attacking the top.‘As soon as it comes to clutch matches, like those ones against Andy Murray, Novak Djokovic, whoever else I have to play, this is where I want to get into that next gear and bring all my goods to the court. Experience: World No 2 Novak Djokovic will contest his eighth Slam final . ‘But I think the rest is just a matter of time.’ For Federer, a 25th Slam final beckons against a man going into his 14th. The Swiss said: ‘It was always going to be hard to get rid of all four guys at the same time, let’s be honest. ‘It’s a big shock. In Australia, there was one [of the old guard] left in the final; here there are two again. At the French it was two. He added: ‘I said before the tournament that it was probably going to be one of the [older] guys in the finals. Novak did his end; I was hoping I was going to be the other one. So I’m very happy with that. ‘Milos and Grigor have both been around for a while now. ‘It’s not like they came about just this year. They have been on tour for five, six years now,  so it’s not somebody entirely new. ‘But with Nick Kyrgios, he’s a totally different situation. We hope we have more of the Kyrgios type, the teenagers coming through. But I am happy to see that Grigor, Milos, all those guys, are knocking on the door more consistently now. We’ll see how the year plays out, if a few guys can make it to the Tour Finals at the end of the year.’ To that end, with Murray set to fall to 10th in the world, some or all of Nishikori, Raonic and Dimitrov could net a debut spot in the Tour Finals in London. But for now, they are still waiting for the torch to be passed.","Young talent are impressing but it will still be a big four name on the trophy .

"The TV ad featured the French footballer lauding the 'French' ingredients . Football icon Eric Cantona heralded France’s favourite beer, Kronenbourg 1664, and the farmers of Alsace who grow the hops used to produce it. A British TV commercial and associated advertisements declared: ‘If you find a better tasting French beer, we’ll eat our berets’. However, perhaps a better analogy would have been flat caps, for this ‘French’ beer is actually brewed in Manchester by the Dutch-owned brewer, Heineken. Now, the Advertising Standards Authority(ASA) has banned the advertising campaign for misleading drinkers about the true origins of the lager. The TV ad featured the French footballer, who spent much of his career at Manchester United, saying: ‘Here in Alsace, things are a little bit different. The hop farmers are treated like the footballers of Britain. ‘They are idolised and adored. And why not? They are living legends. They are the men that grow the noble hops that make Kronenbourg the taste supreme ...’ A second print advertisement made the point that the beer is brewed with Streisselspalt hop to produce ‘A taste supreme’. However, an investigation found that the beer is not made in France, while these Steisselspalt hops make up only a small proportion of the four types that are used. Heineken insisted that its advertisements were simply designed to highlight the beer’s French heritage and ingredients. At the same time, they said there was no danger of viewers being misled because the commercial carried smallprint text stating the beer was ‘Brewed in the UK’. However, in a ruling published today, the ASA said the commercial was misleading. The Advertising Standards Authority has banned the advertising campaign for misleading drinkers about the true origins of the lager . An investigation found that the beer is not made in France, while the 'special' Steisselspalt hops make up only a small proportion of the four types that are used . It said: ‘Although we acknowledged . Heineken’s arguments as to the beer’s heritage and the French origins of . the recipe, we considered that the degree of emphasis in the ad on the . connection with France would lead consumers to believe that the entire . brewing and manufacturing process took place in that country. ‘The ad contained small print stating . that the beer was brewed in the UK, but we considered that contradicted . rather than clarified the main message of the ad. The beer is made at the Royal Brewery in Manchester alongside 'Australian' lager Fosters, which is advertised using two typical alpha-male Aussies on a beach . 'Because we considered . that the overall impression created by the ad was that Kronenbourg 1664 . was brewed in France when it was not, we concluded that it was . misleading.’ The ASA said it . accepted that Strisselspalt hop from Alsace is used in the recipe. But . it said it ‘did not constitute a significant majority of the total hops . used in the recipe for the beer’. The . authenticity of the French identity and ingredients are not the only . suspect elements about the beer. For while the name suggests it has been . brewed since 1664, its origins are much more recent. The . lager was first developed in France in 1952 to celebrate the founder, . Geronimus Hatt, who established the company in Strasbourg in 1664. Global beer companies have developed something of a reputation for using their marketing to fudge the origins of their brews. The Kronenbourg 1664 is made at the . Royal Brewery in Manchester alongside the ‘Australian’ lager Foster’s, . which is advertised using two typical alpha-male Aussies on a beach. Heineken said it was ‘very disappointed’ by the ASA’s decision and has asked for the decision to be reviewed. A . spokesman said: ‘In creating our commercials, we work to the highest . standards and are careful to operate within the letter and spirit of the . relevant codes. ‘Kronenbourg . 1664 is French by any reasonable measure, including brand ownership, . history, heritage and the authentic recipe used. We have never made any . secret that it is also brewed in the UK, and indeed this fact is clearly . communicated within the two commercials that were challenged; and on . every bottle and can. Local brew: Kronenbourg 1664 is brewed in Manchester . ‘The . Strisselspalt hop is a key ingredient, but it is very common in brewing . to use a variety of hops to achieve the final unique taste of a beer. ‘Again, we have never claimed or implied the Strisselspalt is the only hop used, but we feel strongly that we should be able to celebrate the important role that this particular ingredient plays to the taste, aroma and character of the beer. ‘Whilst we must respect and comply with the ASA adjudication, we have already submitted a request to the Independent Reviewer of ASA Adjudications, for it to be reconsidered; as we believe that there were significant flaws in the ruling. ‘In the meantime, we have agreed that the two advertisements will not be used again in their current form.’","Ads watchdog said footballer's adverts for brew were 'misleading'

"Any sprinkling of stardust is guaranteed to light up Westminster. But when it involves Hollywood royalty some who should know better can get drunk on the excitement. David Cameron and William Hague looked more like a pair of awestruck schoolboys than senior politicians as they met Angelina Jolie yesterday. While they retain a statesman-like gravitas in the presence of presidents and monarchs, a Hollywood A-lister is definitely another matter. Particularly this one. Scroll down for video . David Cameron met Angelina Jolie and  William Hague at Downing Street today - after the first day of the Global Summit to End Sexual Violence being chaired by the Hollywood star and the Foreign Secretary . Mr Hague brought Miss Jolie to Number 10 through the gates to Downing Street from the Foreign Office . Their faces lit up, their conversation was animated and they grinned broadly at every comment their star visitor made. Miss Jolie was meeting the Prime Minister and Foreign Secretary in her role as a special envoy for the United Nations. While . she has a serious campaign to promote, she caused quite a stir as she . visited Downing Street and the ExCel exhibition centre  in Docklands.

And All women and girls must be heard.' Far . more impressed by Miss Jolie than the Foreign Secretary, crowds of . visitors followed their every move, camera phones held aloft in the hope . of a photograph with her. One picture of  Miss Jolie and Mr Hague, . posted on Twitter, had the rather uncharitable caption: ‘Brad Pitt . hasn’t aged  very well.’ Other . celebrities attending the event included Stella McCartney, who also . dressed in a flowing white outfit. While Mr Hague and Miss Jolie may . seem an odd  couple, even by the standards of Hollywood, they have made a . number of visits to war zones around the  world together.

William Hague said the Hollywood star's impact on the global campaign to end sexual violence in war had been huge. He said: 'She is very committed to this, very knowledgeable about the issues, she has come up with many of the ideas for the campaign.'

The 'End Sexual Violence in Conflict' summit in London starts today and finishes on Friday. William Hague urged the public to attend the conference . William Hague and Angelina Jolie have formed an unlikely partnership in their battle to end sexual violence in war . Angelina Jolie's attendance at today's Global Summit on Ending Sexual Violence in Conflict is the culmination of 10 years work on the subject . Angelina Jolie may be one of the world’s most famous stars but she has got 'credential as well as celebrity', according to a senior director at a children’s charity. The Special Envoy for the UN Commissioner for Refugees and star of action adventure film Lara Croft: Tomb Raider has a 'strong track record of knowing what she’s talking about'. Jolie’s interest in humanitarian affairs was piqued in 2000 when she went to Cambodia to film Tomb Raider, according to The UN Refugee Agency Website. She was named a Goodwill Ambassador in 2001 by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. In 2012, High Commissioner Antonio Guterres appointed Jolie as his Special Envoy. Anita Tiessen, deputy executive director of children’s charity Unicef UK, said that while she brings her fame to the summit she also brings experience. Ms Tiessen talked about the impact of the 2011 film written and directed by Jolie called In the Land of Blood and Honey which is set during the Bosnian war. 'I think Angelina herself has shown a big commitment to the issue over the last ten years that she’s been an envoy for the issue. 'So yes she clearly brings her fame to the issue and so that attracts a lot of media. But I think she’s got a strong track record of knowing what she’s talking about, of really taking action. 'I was recently in a meeting and the film that she did about rape and abuse during the Bosnian conflict, I heard somebody say very, very powerfully that what that’s done is that it’s made it possible for people in Bosnia to talk about things that they’ve been keeping inside for a long, long time, so I think she’s got credential as well as celebrity,' she said. Ms Tiessen said she believes the summit is going to be 'hugely significant', and said there has been a build-up of about 18 months of work led by Foreign Secretary William Hague. She also said she thinks the week 'will be very, very emotionally charged'. 'I’ve heard children talk about how they’ve been sexually abused, or how they’ve been threatened with sexual abuse, and clearly it’s a very, very...it cuts close to the bone. 'It’s not something that people talk about easily,' she said.","Hollywood star co-hosting conference with Foreign Secretary William Hague .

"Their preparations for the World Cup have been meticulously planned by a dedicated team of sports scientists, physiotherapists and nutritionists. It is therefore something of a surprise that England's footballers were allowed to enjoy a feast of burgers the night after they returned to Rio after losing their opening game. BBC sports presenter Gabby Logan revealed that Roy Hodgson's men dined at a restaurant famous for serving some of Rio de Janeiro's best fast food, including a mammoth 10oz 'Mega Burger'. BBC presenter Gabby Logan talks to former England player Danny Murphy before Saturday's match in Manaus . In the process they denied her the chance to sample the Argentine beef patties for herself because they had booked out the whole place. The FA said the England players' nutritionists gave them special permission to have the treat at the Aquarela Burger bar in the five-star Royal Tulip hotel, where they are staying in Rio. Perhaps of more concern is that a month ago a Brazilian consumer group said it had found food well past its expiry date in the hotel. Restaurant reviews reveal that the burger restaurant has in the past been a favourite with players from Brazilian teams Vasco da Gama and Flamengo, and stays open until 1am every day. Hodgson has a more relaxed attitude to his team's diet, having already reinstated the use of tomato ketchup and brown sauce after they were banned by former England manager Fabio Capello. Logan, 41, who is also staying in the Royal Tulip, wrote on her blog of how the 'Three Lions' scuppered her dinner plans on Monday night. England players were given special permission to have the treat at the Aquarela Burger bar in the five-star Royal Tulip hotel, where they are staying in Rio . England's Jordan Henderson and Daniel Sturridge leave the team hotel, the Royal Tulip at Sao Conrado, for training . Logan, 41, is staying in the Royal Tulip where England are based in Brazil . She said: 'With filming wrapped I suggested to my producer we should try the hotel burger bar, they looked amazing when I saw ITV eating them last week and we haven't succumbed yet. 'You know when you have built up a food in your head all day and you want it so much you can taste it, it is the human equivalent to our Boxer Dog watching a Sunday Roast being carved.' But sadly for the salivating presenter, her hopes of tucking into one of the Royal Tulip's celebrated burgers were dashed. She wrote: 'As we approached the burger bar, I saw a sign saying 'Private Event – Closed”. My heart sank, my stomach flipped. Then I peered in to see who was eating my burger, it was Team England. 'So as Wayne, Steve G and the rest devoured the best Argentinian beef, I had a bowl of chicken soup in the restaurant next door, not that I begrudge them at all. There's always tomorrow….' A source close to the England team told the Daily Mail: 'Poor Gabby really missed a trick – yes, we were enjoying our burgers but she could have ordered one from the adjoining hotel restaurant. She should have read the menu.' An FA spokesman added: 'The team were given a special treat which was cleared by the nutritionists. 'They have been together for more than a month now and they have burnt off thousands of calories so having a burger was not deemed to be harmful in any way.' Several of England's rivals have also been allowed a few comfort foods between their matches in Brazil. Prior to the tournament it was revealed that the Italian FA's chef had packed parmesan, lots of olive oil and prosciutto ham. Team USA brought oatmeal, Cheerios, peanut butter and A1 Steak Sauce to the World Cup party, while the Mexican squad naturally required a little more spice and travelled with chilli peppers, chipotle chillies and cacti. Meanwhile, England's star striker Daniel Sturridge posted a candid selfie on Twitter to vent his frustration when his hotel room TV stopped working. The 24-year-old Liverpool forward was unwinding after training on Monday night by watching an American basketball game. But when the TV set started playing up, he uploaded an angry photograph of himself lying on his bed wearing his white England t-shirt and a second picture of the blank screen. Sturridge, who scored England's only goal in the opening match against Italy, wrote: 'Just when I start getting into the game and it's going off my TV starts acting up... I'm fuming right now!!!' Brazil 2014 is the first true 'selfie World Cup', with many players using Twitter and other social networks to share their personal experiences of the tournament. More than 10,000 people have retweeted or favourited a picture posted by Sturridge of the England team travelling on their coach the day before the Italy game. It is not just the footballers who have succumbed to the current fad for sharing photographs of oneself online. Iranian president Hassan Rouhani took a break from dealing with the jihadist onslaught in neighbouring Iraq to watch his country's 0-0 draw against Nigeria on Monday night. To illustrate his support for Iran's players, he tweeted an incongruous picture of himself relaxing in front of his TV, having swapped his normal black clerical robe and white turban for an Iranian football shirt and tracksuit trousers. In language far removed from the bombastic anti-Western rhetoric of some of his predecessors, Mr Rouhani wrote: 'Proud of our boys who secured our first point - hopefully the first of many more to come.' German chancellor Angela Merkel grinned in a selfie with Germany and Arsenal striker Lukas Podolski while celebrating her country's 4-0 victory over Portugal on Monday. She was earlier pictured with the team in their changing room before many of them had got fully clothed again.","BBC sports presenter revealed Roy Hodgson's men feasted on fast food .

"The secret lives of Britain’s voters has been laid by new research revealing Conservatives are the highest earners, Lib Dems are better educated and Labour voters are least likely to own their own home. But strikingly the study shows the average Ukip supporter is a white, working class man from the Midlands, shattering the image of Nigel Farage’s appeal stretching only to disaffected shire Tories. The study comes as it emerged comedian Jethro has joined Ukip, and the watchdog Ofcom ruled that it should be treated as a major party in England and Wales by broadcasters covering this year's European elections. The survey reveals the stark differences between the appeal of (left to right) David Cameron's Conservatives, Ed Miliband's Labour, Nick Clegg's Lib Dems and Nigel Farage's Ukip . Ukip voters are overwhelmingly male compared to the other parties, who are more evenly split between men and women . Ukip voters are much more likely to be over 65, with Labour having the highest proportion of 18-34-year-olds . The Lib Dems take most of their support from the south, while Labour's appeal is more evenly spread . A major opinion poll of 14,000 people by Populus tracks the age, gender, race, religion and class of voters across the country, and reveals how the major parties appeal to different groups. Tories emerge as the most middle-class, highest earning, most likely to own their own home and living in the south and Midlands. Ukip voters are more likely to be older, white, male, married, retired and living on an average income of £25,410. More Lib Dem voters have a degree, are single and have an average income of £28,730. Almost half of Nick Clegg’s backers live in southern England. Labour supporters are younger, unmarried, earn only £26,460 and are more likely to work in the private sector than other parties’ supporters. Laurence Stellings, associate director of Populus, said: ‘If you look beyond the headlines you can quickly dispel the casual stereotypes about UKIP supporters. ‘They are not just grumpy shire Tories as some suggest. In fact, your typical UKIP supporter is a working class male from the Midlands. ‘Perhaps the most striking feature of UKIP’s support is just how male it is. Nearly two out of three UKIP voters are men, and three quarters of UKIP voters did not continue their education beyond secondary school. ‘You don’t win back voters like this by simple positioning on immigration and Europe. The challenge for David Cameron and others is a lot more difficult than that. He has to find some way to show that he is genuinely on their side.’ Today Ofcom announced that Ukip will be given the same status as the Conservatives, Labour and Liberal Democrats in England and Wales for election broadcasts and news coverage of the May 22 European elections. But Ukip's limited support in Scotland means it will not have to be treated as a major party by broadcasters north of the border or in news coverage focusing solely on Scottish constituencies. While most of the parties divide 50:50 on gender the country overall is split down the middle between men and women, almost two-thirds of Ukip voters are men. Ukip voters are also likely to be much older, with 59 per cent aged 65 or over, compared to 49 per cent of Tories, 40 per cent of Lib Dems and 28 per cent of Labour voters. Westcountry comedian Jethro has joined UKIP. The . comic, real name Geoff Rowe, said he once stood as an anti EU . Independent but had never previously been a member of any political . party. The Cornishman - whose catchphrase is 'what happened was' - said: 'I have given the Conservative Party a few chances but though they make noises about Europe they do nothing. 'That is why I am joining UKIP. They have become a formidable force carrying with them the beliefs of many people.' By contrast, a third of Labour backers are aged 18-34, well ahead of the Tories on 19 per cent and Ukip on just 9 per cent. George Osborne’s pitch for the Tories to become the party of home ownership appears to be paying off: already 81 per cent of Conservative voters own their own property, well ahead of Ukip and the Lib Dems on 70- 71 per cent. Among Labour voters almost half (54 per cent) are renting, including 26 per cent in social housing. Some of the most dramatic differences are found between achievement at school and who people want to run the country. Ukip are most popular among those that never progress beyond secondary school, accounting for 76 per cent of all support, at least 15 points ahead of the Tories and 30 points more than the Lib Dems. Nationwide, 26 per cent of people have a university degree but among Lib Dem voters the figure is 31 per cent, and another 15 per cent have a higher degree, much higher than any of the other parties. On ethnic background, Ukip voters are overwhelmingly white – 98 per cent, compared to 95 per cent for the Tories, 94 per cent Lib Dems and just 86 per cent among Labour. The Tories have the most rural support, accounting for 27 per cent of voters compared to just 21 per cent of the overall population. Only 17 per cent of Labour voters live in rural areas, with Lib Dems and Ukip both on 22 per cent. Fewer than half of Ukip voters are working, compared to 60 per cent of Labour supporters. More than a third (38 per cent) of Ukip support comes from retired people, double the 18 per cent among Labour voters. Tory voters are much more likely to be middle-class. Almost two-thirds (63 per cent) of Conservatives are ABC1 social class, compared to the national average of 54 per cent, and well above to the 45 per cent of Ukip backers. Labour voters are more likely to have children under the age of 10 (27 per cent) compared to Ukip on 10 per cent and a national average of 21 per cent.","New poll shatters image of Ukip supports being disaffected shire Tories .

"Broadcaster Sir Michael Parkinson last night said Sir Cliff Richard is the victim of a 'witch hunt' and criticised the way the BBC covered the raids on his house. The 79-year-old's comments come as sources close to the singer claim he is becoming more and more upset with the way the investigation is being handled after the search of his Berkshire home was beamed live around the world by the BBC on Thursday. Speaking on ITV News, the former BBC journalist said: 'I just think that it's wrong. I think anybody not charged should not be named by the police.' Scroll down for video . Anger: Former Broadcaster Sir Michael Parkinson (left) last night said Sir Cliff Richard is the victim of a 'witch hunt' and criticised both the BBC and South Yorkshire Police over the raids on the singer's home . Search: People, thought to be police officers involved in the search, inside the property on Thursday . Controversial: A BBC news crew  provides news of the raid on Sir Cliff Richard's Berkshire apartment . He added: 'I think the Cliff Richard case only highlights the feeling there is some kind of witch hunt going on. 'I think the BBC did create an error in judgment, not in understanding the story and having the story and trying to follow it through. It was the manner in which they chose to actually cover the event – if you can call it an event.' It has also been reported that three more celebrities are being targeted by police investigating historic sex offences. The Sun claims two TV stars and a musician who lives abroad for tax reasons are under scrutiny. Sir Cliff, 73, has been left 'completely in the dark' by detectives investigating claims of historic child abuse, it emerged last night. South Yorkshire Police has said detectives want to speak to the 73-year-old over an allegation of sexual abuse on a boy under 16 at a Christian rally in 1985. Sir Cliff Richard, with his friend John McElynn, has not been asked for an interview by South Yorkshire Police nor even been contacted by them . Despite police publicly stating they want to speak to the star, he has yet to be contacted since the search. Sources close to Sir Cliff said he did not want to 'start a war of words' over the handling of his case but is understood to be growing increasingly upset with his treatment. The latest development came as stars, politicians and a policing standards body spoke out against the way the case had been handled. Amid farcical scenes, Sir Cliff has been left in 'cruel limbo' since police swooped on his £3million Berkshire home in front of BBC cameras as he holidayed in Portugal. But the singer has yet to hear from police, has not been formally approached for interview and knows nothing of the allegation – nor who his accuser is, his spokesman said. A spokeswoman from South Yorkshire Police said: 'We are not releasing any information on speaking to the owner of the property. That would form part of the investigation and we wouldn't comment.' Sir Cliff, who has dismissed the allegations as 'completely false', is currently at his home in the Algarve . Yesterday Sir Cliff enjoyed tennis in the sunshine as an extraordinary row erupted over the BBC's coverage of the police raid. A source close to the star, who has dismissed the allegations as 'completely false', said: 'He has been left completely in the dark about what is happening. 'There has been no formal request for an interview and no phone call from police since this all started on Thursday.' Smiling and apparently relaxed, Sir Cliff appeared in good spirits as he also enjoyed a dinner party with friends at his Algarve vineyard. Meanwhile in South Yorkshire, Chief Constable David Crompton faced blistering criticism over the force's handling of the case. Former Attorney General Dominic Grieve suggested the force may have contravened police guidelines which say suspects should not be named before being charged unless doing so serves a 'policing purpose' such as protecting the public. He said: 'They have not arrested him or charged him. All they have done is carry out a search of his house so why have they notified the BBC so it could film this taking place? It is very questionable.' Keith Vaz, chairman of the Commons home affairs select committee, is writing to the chief constable to demand an explanation. Crusade: Sir Cliff Richard and Billy Graham at an evangelical rally in Birmingham in 1984 . Former shadow home secretary David Davis added: 'The extraordinary decision by the leadership of South Yorkshire police to allow the searching of Sir Cliff Richard's house to be televised, like some morally challenged reality TV show, demonstrates there is something sick at the heart of Britain's police and justice system.' Investigative journalist and former detective Mark Williams-Thomas, the first to receive the allegations in 2012 when the alleged victim contacted him after his documentary exposing Jimmy Savile, said: 'I am very disappointed at how South Yorkshire Police have handled the investigation.' Meanwhile, South Yorkshire has written an official letter of complaint to Director-General Lord Tony Hall amid suggestions detectives were virtually blackmailed into cooperating with the broadcaster. The force said it reluctantly agreed to 'work with' the BBC after being contacted weeks ago by a reporter who had found out about the investigation. Critical: Former shadow home secretary David Davis and former attorney general Dominic Grieve have both spoken out against South Yorkshire Police . 'It was agreed the reporter would be notified of the date of the house search in return for delaying publication of any of the facts', it said in a statement. 'The force was reluctant to cooperate but felt to do otherwise would risk losing any potential evidence. The broadcasters appear to have contravened editorial guidelines.' Police also called for an inquiry into how the leak reached the BBC. The College of Policing, the professional body that sets standards, said if the leak to the BBC was an unauthorised police disclosure it would contravene the code of ethics. The college's chief executive, Chief Constable Alex Marshall, said: 'The presence of a BBC film crew at the scene of a police search, usually a closely guarded secret, has attracted understandable attention.' Top human rights barrister Geoffrey Robertson QC accused officers of 'treating Cliff Richard as though he were a bank robber or a mass murderer' then leaving the star in 'cruel limbo'. South Yorkshire Police and Crime Commissioner Shaun Wright also launched a probe. His spokesman said: 'Questions need to be answered as to the original source of the leak, which put the force in a difficult position when approached by the media.' Yesterday the BBC said: 'The BBC agreed to follow normal journalistic practice and not to publish a story that might jeopardise a police inquiry.'","Broadcaster criticises coverage of police raid on star's home .

"A 21-year-old woman who was seven months pregnant was killed on Sunday in a drive-by shooting in Miami, but doctors still managed to deliver her baby before she passed away. The child, a little boy, remains in a critical condition. Police have identified the victim as Quelecia James, of Miami Gardens, who was a passenger in a car that was travelling northbound on Northwest 32nd Avenue about 2pm. A second car drove up alongside the vehicle that was carrying James - who has a four-year-old daughter - and its passenger began shooting, according to CBS Miami.

"More than one in ten of the world's overweight people live in America, a larger amount than any other country, and almost the same as China and India combined . British girls are the fattest in Europe – almost a third are overweight or obese, says a study. Girls under 20 top a league table of 22 nations in Western Europe, with 29.2 per cent being overweight and obese. Of those, 8 per cent of the girls meet the clinical definition of obesity, having a Body Mass Index of 30 or above. Older British women are also battling the pounds with 57 per cent classified as fat – third highest after Iceland and Malta. Estimates from a global study for 2013 found 66.6 per cent of men in the UK are fat. This places them fifth in the European league table. An estimated 26 per cent of British boys under 20 are overweight and obese – placing them 10th. The report from the US-based Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, published in The Lancet, says there has been an increase in obese  children in developed countries. But the rise in adult obesity has slowed down. ‘In developed countries, peak prevalence of obesity is moving to younger ages,’ says the report. ‘Evidence of a slowdown in the rate of increase of overweight and obesity in the developed world provides some hope that the epidemic might have peaked in developed countries.’ But obesity remains a ‘major global health challenge,’ the report adds, with no national success  stories reported over the past  three decades. The UK and Australia have seen large rises in obesity during this period. However, the US tops the global league table, containing 13 per cent of the world’s obese people. Globally there are around 2billion overweight people, a third of the world's population, with every country seeing waistlines expand over the last 30 years . The study was funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. John Newton, chief knowledge officer at the government agency Public Health England, said that the ‘worrying’ prevalence of obesity among British girls was partly due to peer pressure to eat fast food. He told The Times: ‘We have to look at the environment in which people are living, and the constant pressure to eat unhealthy food means things are particularly a problem for girls more than boys.’","Study finds 29.2 per cent of girls under age of 20 are overweight or obese .
