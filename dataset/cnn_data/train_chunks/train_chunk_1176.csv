"A Sydney radio presenter has been dumped from a guest spot on 2GB radio after he called the prophet Mohammed a pedophile. Michael Smith had been booked to present Chris Smith's afternoon program on 2GB for three weeks starting on Monday. But the former 2UE presenter claimed on his website that 2GB's program director David Kidd phoned him on Friday night and said he wouldn't be needed because 'you can't call a Deity a pedophile'. Scroll down for video . Michael Smith had been booked to present Chris Smith's afternoon program on 2GB for three weeks starting on Monday but claims he was told he was no longer needed after controversial comments made on Thursday . Smith's controversial comments came during a regular guest spot with 2GB host Ben Fordham on Thursday. 'The prophet Mohammad was a pedophile, a pederast, a sexual offender, a man who promoted the idea that it was okay to marry a six-year-old and consummate the marriage when the little girl was nine,' he said. 'And that's written into their books, it's part of the philosophy… the Koran. It's factually correct.' Smith pointed out that he'd made similar comments on 2UE in 2011 and had been acquitted of a complaint of inciting hatred and of factual inaccuracy by the Australian Communications and Media Authority. The pair were discussing the recent controversy over a talk the Festival of Dangerous Ideas had booked and later cancelled at the Sydney Opera House with a Muslim activist on whether honour killings could be morally justified. Smith's controversial comments where he called the prophet Mohammad a pedophile came during a regular guest spot with 2GB host Ben Fordham (pictured) Smith implied activist Uthman Badar's invitation to speak at the festival was similar to asking the leader of the Ku Klux Klan to speak. The comments sparked a barrage of calls from angry listeners, including a very emotional man named Mohammad who hung up after telling Smith his comments were 'ridiculous'. 'What the heck do you think you're adding to the debate when you call the prophet, peace be upon him, a pedophile?' the listener said. 2GB presenter Ray Hadley also criticised Smith's comments during his show on Friday morning. The pair were discussing the recent controversy over a talk the Festival of Dangerous Ideas had booked and later cancelled at the Sydney Opera House with a Muslim activist, Uthman Badar, on whether honour killings could be morally justified . 'I value the worth of this station in the community and sometimes I've been guilty of tarnishing its reputation and for that I've apologised,' Hadley said. 'I want to go on record today and completely distance myself from Mr Smith's comments as well. Yesterday I was insulted by what was said… and I've got to speak out against it. It's not about stifling speech, it's about being fair and decent.' Smith said on his website he stood by his comments. 'I've thought about what I said in answer to Ben's question. I think it's wrong for a man in his 50s to have sex with a 9 year old child. It is wrong, it's a crime and it should be called out for what it is,' he wrote. 'I know Ray Hadley disagrees with me - perhaps Ray could let us know what part of a grown man having sex with a 9 year old girl is right?' Despite criticism from 2GB radio veteran Ray Hadley, Mr Smith Smith said on his website he stood by his comments .","Michael Smith was booked to present 2GB's afternoon radio program for three weeks starting on Monday .

"Mario Balotelli gave manager Brendan Rodgers a timely reminder of what he is capable of as the misfiring Liverpool striker hit the target during an indoor training session, although it was only a bottle and not the net. The 24-year-old has failed to impress for the Reds since his £16million move from AC Milan last summer, scoring just twice in all competitions - and still without a goal in the Premier League. Such was his lack of form and playing time, the maverick Italian was linked with a move away from Anfield in the recent transfer window, but a return to Italy failed to materialise. Mario Balotelli gets hold of the ball prior to the target practice on Tuesday . The Liverpool striker strikes the ball cleanly with his right foot as the ball heads towards the bottle . The ball lands straight on to the bottle as the Liverpool striker shows he still has got it . But there is still room for optimism that Balotelli can turn his Liverpool career around, with the striker all smiles as he posted a video on Instagram showing off his ball skills. Balotelli posted the message 'lol crazy easy' accompanied with the video, as the former Milan striker accurately knocked over a plastic bottle from distance with a right-footed effort . Balotelli will be hoping to strike up a partnership with fit-again Daniel Sturridge at the heart of the Liverpool attack, after the latter returned from a five-month lay off to score in a win against West Ham last Saturday. The 24-year-old celebrates after effectively hitting the target - in this case a  bottle . The former AC Milan striker has failed to score a single Premier League goal since arriving at Anfield . Mario Balotelli's agent recently revealed the striker has been 'very disappointed' with his time at Liverpool .","Mario Balotelli is yet to score in the Premier League for Liverpool .

"From water-fuelled cars to shape-shifting tricycles, finding ways to cut emissions has led to some bizarre vehicle designs over the years. Now Mercedes-Benz has unveiled what it claims to be the ultimate in ‘green driving’- a concept car that doubles up as a huge solar panel to generate energy. Using something known as ‘multi-voltaic’ silver paint, the German manufacturer’s Vision G-Code is designed to capture energy from solar rays to power a hybrid engine. Scroll down for video . Mercedes-Benz has unveiled what it claims to be the ultimate in ‘green driving’- a concept car that doubles up as a huge solar panel to generate energy . It can even generate power using electrostatic charge from the bodywork slicing through wind, as well as kinetic energy from the suspension. The SUV concept car - or SUC (Sports Utility Coupé) as Mercedes-Benz calls it - was unveiled this week at the company’s new research base in Beijing. As part of its set up, the back wheels are powered by an electric motor while the front wheels are driven by a hydrogen combustion engine. Mercedes-Benz envisages operating the motor and engine either individually or together, depending on road conditions. Using something known as ‘multi-voltaic’ silver paint, the German manufacturer’s Vision G-Code is designed to capture energy from solar rays to power a hybrid engine . The four-door vehicle is roughly the same size as a Nissan Juke, at 13.5ft (4.1 metres) long. Mercedes has yet to offer other specifics on speed and power. Instead of B-pillars, the vehicle’s doors are hinged front and back allowing easier access to the rear-seat. The car also features a light display at the front of the car - a reference to Starship Enterprise’s glowing warp drive. The light glows blue when the car is parked, purple during normal hybrid driving and red in sport mode.

Instead of B-pillars, the vehicle’s doors are hinged front and back allowing easier access to the rear-seat . The car also features a light display at the front of the car - a reference to Starship Enterprise’s glowing warp drive (pictured) in Star Trek . Just as striking is the continuous glass panel which stretches from the driver's side window around the windshield to the passenger side. The interior also features anti-dirt fabrics and 3D body scanners that keep an eye on biometrics of each passenger, automatically switching on the massage-mode if the car decides passengers are getting tired. Daimler has opened a research and development (R&D) centre in Beijing tasked with further tuning its Mercedes-Benz brand to wealthy Chinese tastes. The German car maker is expanding its Mercedes-Benz brand in China at a time when an investigation into anti-competitive practices in the auto industry is prompting car makers to lower prices. The company said it plans to raise the number of Mercedes-Benz engineers and other specialists in Beijing to 500 by the end of next year from 350. Its focus on Chinese tastes should help Mercedes-Benz catch up in the local luxury car segment with Volkswagen AG's Audi and BMW, he said. Researcher LMC Automotive projects Mercedes-Benz to sell 291,000 vehicles in China this year, compared with 581,000 for luxury market-leader Audi and 448,000 for second-placed BMW. Meanwhile, oxygen produced by the hydrogen drivetrain is pumped into the cabin to improve air quality. It even features electric scooters hidden under the trunk floor to complete journeys without having to go on foot. While this is a concept car, the hope is that a number of the ideas featured in the design could someday make their way onto Mercedes-Benz’ models in the future.

"The damaging effect alcohol can have on health is widely publicised - with experts warning of depression, liver disease and even an early grave. But a new tool created by website Rehabs also shows the negative effect excessive drinking can have on your appearance. By uploading a picture you can chart the change in your features over five-year intervals to see how alcohol can alter your face. Scroll down for video . Try out the tool directly below . California-based company Rehabs has released an 'alcoholic' tool (pictured). It shows you what your face will look like if you keep drinking for years. The tool shows your changing appearance over the next 20 years . To the use the tool you need to click the ‘Start’ button above. You will then be asked to either upload a photo or use your webcam to take one of yourself. Then the tool asks you to position eyes, nose and lip icons over your own facial features. The result is a series of pictures that shows how your appearance will change from two to 20 years into the future. ‘Our team over at rehabs.com is well aware of the many different causes of alcoholism, and in an attempt to combat them, created this interactive web tool that shows users what they would look like after two, five, 10 and 20 years of heavy drinking,’ a spokesperson told MailOnline. The programme initially morphs the user's face to bring about changes to the face's shape. It then applies a transparent mask  to add skin defects characteristic of long term alcoholism such as broken capillaries, a bloated face, reddened complexion and so on. The spokesperson added: 'The purpose of the program is to create a shock factor for users, preying on the vanity, in hopes that the very ugly future of their actions will incite behavioural change.' Alcohol is a diuretic, so it causes us - and in turn our skin - to become dehydrated far more easily. This has both an instant and long-term effect on our skin and hair. Dehydration causes skin to become dry and hair to become brittle. Excessive alcohol consumption also depletes iron levels which can exacerbate a pale, lifeless complexion and hair loss. Facial puffiness can also be caused by lymph fluid leaking from enlarged blood vessels into tissue. Because alcohol can sap the body of Vitamin C and A, the skin also becomes less resilient to environmental causes of ageing such as the sun and pollution. This is because lowered levels of these vitamins lead to the reduced production of collagen, the substance responsible for making our skin look plump and youthful. Heavy drinking also affects the skin because alcohol robs us of B Vitamins. Alcoholics often develop skin rashes that could resemble eczema from such deficiencies. Skin is also much more prone to becoming red and blotchy. This is because alcohol dilates the blood vessels. Many people who suffer from the flushing condition rosacea find that they become red-cheeked if they drink. However, if you drink large amount regularly, eventually the blood vessels can burst leaving people with permanently red cheeks or the notorious 'drinker's nose'. Chronic alcohol abuse often shows itself in  dark circles under the eyes. This is because in the long-term, alcoholism thins the skin, making blood vessels beneath the surface more visible. It is worth adding that those who abuse alcohol tend to neglect their health in general, so the damage that drink does often goes hand-in-hand with the incredibly ageing and health-damaging habit of smoking. Terrifying: The program initially morphs the user's face to bring about changes to the face's shape. It then applies a transparent mask to add skin defects characteristic of long term alcoholism such as broken capillaries, bloated face, reddened complexion and so on. Shown is a young male using the program . Earlier this month researchers from the University of Missouri School of Medicine warned that binge drinking can also alter your genes. They say that excessive alcohol use can cause changes in the liver. However, they also say the discovery could lead to new treatments for alcohol related kidney disease. Drinking just two glasses of wine a day can damage your health, according to a study. The research challenged previous claims that moderate amounts of alcohol could have a protective effect on the heart. Even if you drink as little as 12 units a week - less than a pint of beer or two small glasses of wine a day - this will still have a negative effect on health said scientists from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. Earlier this month, the Government warned people to have a 'one day on, one day off' policy when drinking, to avoid damaging their health. 'We know that chronic alcohol use is damaging to the liver, but binge drinking amplifies that damage,' said Shivendra Shukla, who led the research. Excessive alcohol use is one of the most common causes of chronic liver failure. Long-term liver damage from alcohol use is irreversible. Excessive alcohol use is also associated with high blood pressure, heart disease, stroke, cancer and digestive problems. 'Every response in the body is due to alterations in proteins,' Shukla said. 'Binge drinking is an environmental trigger that negatively affects histones by altering the correct binding of DNA. 'The result is unnecessary replication in the copied structure. 'This initially causes inflammation and damage to the cells as they form, but it is also eventually the cause of more serious diseases such as cirrhosis and cancer.' The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism defines binge drinking as a pattern of drinking that brings a person's blood alcohol concentration to 0.08 grams percent or above. To use the tool you need to upload a picture or take one with a webcam.

"An 18-year-old who beat his mother to death with a hammer then sexually abused her body smiled at jurors during the murder trial. Kevin Davis, from Corpus Christi, Texas, was found guilty and sentenced to life in prison for the murder of 50-year-old Kimberly Hill on Wednesday. During the trial, prosecutors played a taped confession of Davis confessing to the murder on March 26. Kevin Davis, an 18-year-old who beat his mother to death with a hammer then sexually abused her body smiled at jurors during his murder trial . Kevin Davis, from Corpus Christi, Texas, was found guilty and sentenced to life in prison for the murder of 50-year-old Kimberly Hill (pictured) on Wednesday . Davis admitted to investigators he had choked his mother with a cord and stabbed her in the head before finally killing her with a hammer, according to KiiiTV. The teenager had reportedly asked his mother for permission to die, because he had grown 'weary with life and hated other people.' When she told him she was upset, but that he could decide to do what he wished, he snapped and murdered her, the Corpus Cristi Caller Times reported. Grisly: Jurors heard Davis describe everything he did to his mother during an interview, where he signed his confession . No remorse: Davis told police who interviewed him that he did not regret what he had done, though he says he did love her . Police found Hill's body undressed from the waist down and posed. Davis told investigators during his interview that he had sexually abused his mother after she was murdered. In the interview, Davis told investigators, 'I wouldn’t take back what I did. I did love her in a way' Davis almost waited for his sister to kill her too, but decided against it, instead leaving a trail of blood in the home leading from the living room to the master bedroom, along with written messages such as 'Chase me. Sorry for the mess. KD.' 'I had my fill of killing. It seemed a little much,' he told investigators. From his home, he took his bicycle and backpack and tried to leave town. He eventually abandoned both in a bush by the train tracks and walked to a home in nearby Robstown, where he confessed to a couple. In the interview, Davis told investigators, 'I wouldn’t take back what I did. I did love her in a way.' 'I’m a terrible, disgusting person,' he added. He also told investigators he had homicidal fantasies about his sister and mother. Calling it 'a night to remember,' he described another fantasy where he would decapitate a girl before having sex with her body in a dress. The defense called no witnesses during the trial, and when Davis's lawyer appealed for a lighter sentence in light of mental issues Davis had, the prosecution's reply was to say that it had seen no medical evidence of any mental or emotional illness. Davis told investigators he thought he deserved 100 years and claimed, 'I'm not mentally disturbed. I’m sane. I know what I did.' 'I don’t have standards. I don’t have morals. A body’s a body. A piece of meat,' said Davis.","Kevin Davis, 18, killed his mother, Kimberly Hill, 50 in March in Texas .

Star Trek actor William Shatner has been forced into an embarrassing apology after joking on television that the coastal town of Ilfracombe is 'laced with prostitution'. Shatner, who had been guest hosting the BBC's satirical quiz 'Have I Got News For You' last month, singled out the Devon town as a 'haven' for sex workers, to howls of laughter from panellists and the studio audience. The 81-year-old made the ill-judged quip despite never having visiting the town, and drew a furious response from an Ilfracombe councillor, who wrote to Shatner personally. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Colourful: Shatner's outspoken remark on Have I Got News For You (above) capped a typically outrageous on-air performance from the actor, who also showed a woeful grasp of British current affairs on the topical news quiz . Response: Ilfracombe councillor Paul Crabb wrote to Shatner inviting him to the town following the on-air comments made last month . Ill-judged: William Shatner's remark led to a letter from former mayor of Ilfracombe Paul Crabb (right), who subsequently received an apology from the veteran actor . On an episode of the show broadcast on . May 28, Ilfracombe had been mentioned as an Olympic torch relay venue, . causing Shatner to comically mispronounce its name and guest Charlie . Brooker to note that it sounded 'deeply sexual'. This . led Shatner to joke that the town is 'laced with prostitution', drawing . guffaws of shocked laughter from regular panellists Ian Hislop and Paul . Merton. Ilfracmbe is billed on its own tourism website as a Devon town with 'curious coastal charm'. According to Trip Advisor, the top attraction in the seaside resort is the Tunnels Beaches, a network of hand-carved tunnels 'leading to unique sheltered beaches and tidal victorian bathing pool'. Ilfracombe Museum, meanwhile, boasts 'natural history specimens from around the world, and so much to explore about Ilfracombe's past'. Another attraction in the coastal town is Watermouth Castle, a castle which is also a family theme park with 'eclectic treasures, nostalgic displays and curios'. Animal lovers might be tempted by the nearby Combe Martin Wildlife and Dinosaur Park, which features African lions, wolves, meerkats, penguins and exotic birds among its residents. A final historical suggestion for visitors to the town is Larkstone Cafe and Leisure Park - a 1920s tennis club and tearoom which boasts views of Ilfracombe Harbour and the Bristol Channel. Straight away . Charlie Brooker suggested: 'That will be their new slogan now', while . Paul Merton added: ''You try and buy a stick of rock there.' Following the remark, town councillor Paul Crabb wrote to Shatner via his agent inviting him to the coastal town. Mr . Crabb said: 'As Captain James T Kirk, Mr Shatner has been to places . where no man has gone before, however, the episode of HIGNFY clearly . shows he has never been to Ilfracombe. 'If . he came we could show him that there is no prostitution in Ilfracombe . and that it is a lovely coastal town with spectacular scenery and a . close community.' In an email sent to Mr Crabb and signed 'Bill', Shatner wrote that prostitution 'commonly means sex for something of value. 'I would be hard pressed to believe that sex was not being had in Ilfracombe for something of value, perhaps a lengthy marriage, children or a valuable career. 'In any event, my apologies for having singled out Ilfracombe as a potential haven for prostitution. With you overseeing, I am sure that will not happen.' The incident is the second time in less than a year that Ilfracombe has come in for a public slating. Last September, a tourist complained of the 'foul stench' of fish his family were subjected to after walking past a trawler in the working harbour. David Copp, 46, was with his children on a trip to Devon when he contacted authorities in the port of Ilfracombe to lodge a formal complaint about 12 crates of dead fish and crabs lining the harbour wall.","Veteran actor made remark whilst hosting Have I Got News For You .

"A key clue has linked pro-Moscow rebels to the truck seen carrying the BUK missile system towards Russia hours after MH17 was downed, it is claimed. The owner of what is said to be the only such white Volvo truck in the Donetsk region of Ukraine has identified his lorry and said it was commandeered by separatists who took over his premises nine days before the Malaysia Airlines Boeing 777 was shot out of the sky, killing all 298 people on board. Footage shot by a clandestine Ukrainian police team showed an image of a BUK weapons system on a Volvo truck being smuggled out of eastern Ukraine in the early hours of July 18, the day after the plane crash. Scroll down for video . The owner of what is said to be the only such white Volvo truck in the Donetsk region of Ukraine has identified his lorry and said it was commandeered by separatists who took over his premises nine days before the Malaysia Airlines Boeing 777 was shot out of the sky . Footage shot by a clandestine Ukrainian police team showed an image of a BUK weapons system on a Volvo truck being smuggled out of eastern Ukraine in the early hours of 18 July . A Lithuanian news website revealed it has spoken to the truck's owner - identified only as Vasiliy - stressing: 'Western intelligence agencies have managed to establish the truck's origin and movements.' Website alfa.lt said that Vasiliy - a 'new witness to this horrible crime' - now fears for his life. It is believed he could identify the rebels who commandeered his premises and vehicles, a potentially key link in building a case against those responsible for downing the aircraft. 'The testimony of this person is exceptionally important -- it becomes undeniably clear that the anti-aircraft system that shot down the passenger plane was in the hands of the terrorists supported by the Kremlin,' stated the news agency. Vasiliy said that on July 8 his truck was taken by rebels. 'Do not reveal my name -- I already have plenty of problems,' he said. 'My base in Donetsk was taken over and it was parked there. Yes, this is my vehicle. They came to our base and said they needed it.' Members of a group of international experts inspect wreckage last week at the site where the downed Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 crashed . 'Everyone left from the eighth (of July), and the base was under their control, including my equipment and that white truck.' Asked if the truck was his - in the video footage at 4.50am on July 18 showing the BUK missile system being transported through Kransnodon towards Russia - he said: 'Yes, of course. It is easy to recognise. We know our vehicles. Yes, it is ours.' He insisted it was 'the only one of its kind in the region of Donetsk. It is the only Volvo with such a cabin'. Vasiliy did not specify for what work his 'base' was used. Neither . he nor his staff now work at the premises which are in rebel hands, he . made clear. The website said it knows Vasiliy's full identity. The footage is said by Ukrainian sources to show the BUK system being transported through Krasnodon. A woman pushes her bicycle near the crash site of the Malaysia Airlines Flight MH17 . Meanwhile, Russia is staging major new military exercises on Ukraine's frontier amid fresh fears in Kiev over an invasion. More than 100 planes and helicopters will take part in the manoeuvres from Monday until Friday, said an air force spokesman, quoted by Interfax news agency. The new Kremlin show of strength is certain to alarm Western leaders and comes after Kiev had warned of a significant swelling of military equipment and troops in Russian border regions. Spokesman Igor Klimov said aircraft such as Su-27 and MiG-31 fighter jets, Russia's newest frontline bomber Su-34, and Mi-8, Mi-24 and Mi-28N helicopters would be used in the exercises and the aircraft would conduct missile practice. The move comes as the Dutch and Australian experts are sifting through the wreckage of flight MH17 in tense conditions in rebel-held eastern Ukraine. Its timing comes as many Western leaders go on holiday following today's ceremonies to mark the start of World War One. Russia is staging major new military exercises on Ukraine's frontier amid fresh fears in Kiev over an invasion. Pictured is Russian military equipment in Gomel, Belarus . More than 100 planes and helicopters will take part in the manoeuvres from Monday until Friday, said an air force spokesman, quoted by Interfax news agency . The aircraft will be testing 'aircraft weapons on land and air targets on new ranges, and will be conducting real and electronic launches of anti-aircraft missiles in Ashuluk (Astrakhan region in southern Russia) which is specifically designed to aide the coordination between aviation and anti-missile defence',  said the spokesman. Ahead of the announcement, Ukraine had already warned that Russia has placed forces displaying the insignia of 'peacekeepers', with concerns expressed about an invasion of eastern regions. A weekend demonstration was allowed in Moscow attended by up to 4,000 calling for Vladimir Putin to defy the West and send troops to rebel-held Donetsk and Lugansk. Residents in both cities fear a siege as Ukraine's army closes in and Kiev defence minister Valeriy Heletey claims his forces will be victorious 'very soon'. But Ukraine's National Security and Defence Council also say that Russia is building up its forces in border areas and even in neighbouring Belarus. Kiev has long feared that if Russian troops invade from the east they will do so under the pretext of 'peacekeeping' while in fact annexing all or part of Donetsk and Lugansk regions. Ukraine's National Security and Defence Council also say that Russia is building up its forces in border areas and even in neighbouring Belarus . 'The Russians have been amassing their personnel and hardware near the Ukrainian-Russian border,' stated spokesman for the National Security and Defence Council, Andriy Lysenko. 'A brigade of helicopter units from the Russian armed forces was transferred into Belovsk and Sudzha districts in Kursk region. 'And 34 items of military armoured hardware bearing signs of a military peacekeeping contingent are deployed near the village of Belaya Berezka in Bryansk region. 'A Russian military train comprising 65 platforms with self-propelled mortars arrived at the Pawnochnaya railway station in Gomel, Belarus.' Lysenko also alleged that ten more Russian tanks broke through the Ukrainian border and into rebel hands at the weekend. 'The tanks are moving towards Donetsk,' he said. Ukrainian tanks drive near the eastern Ukrainian village of Novoselivka Persha, some 15kms from Donetsk, Ukraine, last week . Russia has repeatedly denied Western claims that its military hardware is being put into separatist hands, and there was no independent verification of Lysenko's claims. He also alleged rebels had barred an Australian police contingent from deploying drones at the site of the crashed Malaysia Airlines aircraft, amid fears they would provide proof of separatists using Russian weaponry in the area. 'The ban on using an UAV shows that the terrorists are not interested in a comprehensive and unbiased investigation. The use of an UAV would have made it possible to swiftly examine a large area, identify the site on the plan and find new evidence. 'It can also register areas where mines are laid and gunmen's positions are located.' Ten civilians were killed in Donetsk region in the latest  clashes between rebels and government forces. People in Donetsk are stocking up with flour, canned food, cooking oil, instant coffee, candles and batteries as government forces tighten the noose around pro-Russian separatists.","Key clue links pro-Moscow rebels to truck seen carrying BUK missile system .

"George W. Bush has praised the 40 passengers and crew who fought back against their Flight 93 hijackers on 9/11 for carrying out what he described as one of the most courageous acts in U.S. history. The former president was at a ceremony on Saturday dedicating a memorial at the nation's newest national park in Shanksville, Pennsylvania, as the U.S. marks the 10th anniversary of the terror attacks. Americans will also come together on Sunday where the World Trade Center soared in Manhattan, New York, and in Washington D.C. where the Pentagon now stands as a fortress once breached.

Barack Obama planned to attend ceremonies at both sites, as well as the . Pennsylvania memorial, and was scheduled to speak at a Sunday evening . service at the Kennedy Center. The . New York ceremony begins at 8:30am local time, with a moment of silence 16 minutes . later - coinciding with the exact time when the first tower of the World Trade Centre was struck by a hijacked jet. And . then, one by one, there will be the reading of names of the 2,977 . killed on September 11 - in New York, at the Pentagon and in rural . Pennsylvania. Where the twin towers of the World .

Mr Bush said the cockpit storming . ‘ranks among the most courageous acts in American history’ and former . president Bill Clinton said the passengers and crew were ‘ordinary . people given no time at all to decide’ what to do. Mr . Clinton likened the actions of those aboard Flight 93 to the defenders . of the Alamo in Texas or the Spartans at the Battle of Thermopylae some . 2,500 years ago, who knew they were going to die. 'They . gave the entire country an incalculable gift,’ Mr Clinton added. ‘They . saved the capital from attack’ and avoided Al Qaeda’s a symbolic victory . of ‘smashing the centre of American government.’ The remarks by Mr Bush and Mr Clinton . drew standing ovations and loud cheers from the ceremony which drew . about 5,000 people, including 4,000 invited guests including the crash . victims' families.

Former first lady Laura Bush and Jill Biden, wife of Vice President Biden, were both seen to wipe tears away at the ceremony. ‘The . moment America's democracy was under attack our citizens defied their . captors by holding a vote,’ Mr Bush said, referring to when those on the . plane decided to try to overpower the hijackers. ‘The choice they made would cost them . their lives,’ he added. Mr Bush was joined at the ceremony by the . Reverend Daniel Coughlin, who was the U.S. House chaplain at the time of . the attacks. Gordon Felt, president of the Families . of Flight 93, whose brother Edward participated in the revolt by . passengers and crew, described the memorial a ‘huge accomplishment’. ‘It's . one that brings so much comfort to the families knowing, finally, that . the sacred ground, the site where the flight came down and our loved . ones rest in perpetuity, is finally protected,' he said.

Mr Obama was a little-known state senator in Illinois at the time of the attacks, but now has the responsibility to help lead the nation in remembrance of a trauma 10 years on. Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, who gave the weekly Republican address, said the terrorists achieved their goal of killing Americans, but failed to destroy the U.S. spirit. ‘The country was not broken, but rather, it was more united in the days after September 11 than at any time in my lifetime,’ Mr Giuliani said.","America remembers the day 10 years ago when terrorists flew planes into the World Trade Center and Pentagon .

"Bungling: Andrew Cushman took a bath during a raid on a home and helped himself to a microwave dinner . A burglar who took a bath during a raid on a home and helped himself to a microwave dinner has been jailed for nearly four years. Andrew Cushman was caught after taking a soak in the tub and having dinner at a house he broke into in Chatham, Kent, on October 20 last year. Maidstone Crown Court heard how the 40-year-old serial burglar had sneaked into the house through the window and helped himself to various electronic items and tools. But before leaving the house he ran himself a bath and cooked himself dinner before trying to sneak out. However, his luck ran out when he was spotted by a neighbour - who wouldn't have noticed him had Cushman not spent more than an hour relaxing in the tub and eating a microwave meal. The neighbour approached the crook and demanded to know what he was doing in the house, when Cushman punched him in the head and ran off. The neighbour called the owner - a woman with small children - telling her she had been burgled and she came home to find her house 'trashed', with food gone from her freezer, the microwave splattered with food and her bath covered in dirt. The court heard how drug addict Cushman, of no fixed abode, was arrested after police discovered a hypodermic needle with his DNA on it in a cot of one of the victim's children. Detective Constable Steve Day of Kent Police, said: 'Cushman is a prolific career criminal with numerous convictions for burglary dwellings. 'He has had a significant impact on people's lives in the past with his criminal offending and in this case, entering a property and leaving needles around the house, including in a child's bed, is beyond contempt. 'This sentence should send a clear message out to burglary offenders in Medway that criminals will be dealt with robustly and that Kent Police will do everything in its power to make the public feel safe in their homes.' Guilty: Cushman was jailed for nearly four years at Maidstone Crown Court. He was trapped by DNA evidence from a discarded needle . Cushman denied two counts of burglary and common assault, but was found guilty and jailed for a total of three years and nine months. A spokesman for Kent Police said: 'A prolific burglar that took a bath and cooked food during a break-in at a house in Chatham has been jailed for nearly four years. 'When she (the victim) returned home she found the house had been trashed, food had been eaten, the microwave used and a number of hypodermic needles left around the house, including one in a child's cot. 'It was also found the intruder had decided to take a bath. 'A neighbour walking past the house at the time stopped after noticing the property had been trashed and confronted Cushman who was seen coming out of the house with some tools. 'The man asked him what he was doing and when he tried to look in the property, Cushman punched him in the side of the head. 'The man hit him back before running into the property to check if the occupant and her children were in and Cushman ran off.' He added: 'Officers sent the needles off for forensic identification which confirmed they were Cushman's.'","Andrew Cushman stole tools and electrical items from empty home .

"Comedian Eddie Izzard issued a plea to Scotland ‘please don’t go’, becoming the latest celebrity to warn against backing independence. Izzard admitted he found the launch of the new slogan ‘intimidating’ after being subjected to online abuse when he announced he would stage a fundraiser for the Better Together campaign. Singer David Bowie, tennis ace Andy Murray and broadcaster Andrew Marr have previously been targeted online by ‘cyber nats’. Comedian Eddie Izzard today issued a plea to Scots not to leave the United Kingdom . Speaking ahead of the fundraiser, . Izzard said he is expecting more foul-mouthed abuse than when cutting . his comedy teeth on the streets of Edinburgh and Glasgow. ‘It's . quite a tricky thing because you guys are quite intimidating,’ he . said.  ‘Obviously if there are people who are politically against it, . that is quite intimidating. ‘I am going into politics. I'm running for office in 2020 so I am more up to speed on this, but it's a tricky old thing.’ He . said he remains ‘positive’ about the Scottish people and its . Parliament, which he thinks should have as many powers as Scots want it . to have. He contrasted the . ‘blood and death’ of the border wars of history with the united spirit . of Team GB, recalling Scottish tennis ace Andy Murray's Olympic gold . winning victory which he watched in the back of an Edinburgh taxi. ‘It . wasn't me, an Englishman, saying look there's a Scotsman,’ he said. ‘It . was just that we are British, and he was winning, and it was us, and I . think that is beautiful. ‘If . you look back at the history of what used to happen between the Scots . and the English, the war and the blood and the death, I think it is . beautiful that we have got to this position of being together.' The event marked a stepping up of the Better Together campaign after polls narrowed in recent days . Izzard joined activists making telephone calls to undecided Scottish referendum voters at Teviot House part of Edinburgh University . Izzard went on: ‘I am an Englishman called Edward, and . there are a few Edwards that have had a history at Bannockburn and in . the Braveheart film. ‘But I . am an Edward who ran eight marathons with a Scottish flag. I ran to the . top of Arthur's Seat here in Edinburgh, and I've also played nearly . every major town and city in Scotland up to and including Shetland. ‘I've run the whole of the UK and I didn't find a difference when I got to the border of Scotland. ‘I . do want to do honour to the Scottish people. When I watched Braveheart I . was in tears and I was rooting for the Scottish people.’ He . appeared alongside former Chancellor Alistair Darling as the No . campaign stepped up its drive to woo voters, amid growing concern that . the polls have narrowed I recent weeks. Izzard . pledged to keep his jokes apolitical at the Better Together fundraiser . at Edinburgh's Festival Theatre tonight, but said he is expecting some . heckling. ‘You've got to . realise that I am transvestite so I've already had a lot of negative . things said to me over the years in the street, so nothing in politics . can happen which is worse than that,’ he said, bearing his nails painted . with the British and European flags. ‘It's . a political statement, British European transvestite, and if you're a . Scottish transvestite you can have the same nails and it will still . work.’ Better Together leader Alistair Darling joined Izzard at the event to launch the slogan: 'Scotland, Please don't go!' Izzard will be joined on stage by local comedian Andy Todd, author of the satirical book Fat Minister's Question Time. Todd said: ‘The referendum is a serious issue but that doesn't mean we can't make jokes about it. ‘With months of campaigning behind us and five months still to go, it's easy to lose track of the issues as each side goes over them again and again and again. ‘A good joke is like a firework. It cuts through everything and makes even the most jaded sit up and listen. ‘The referendum is a decision for the people of Scotland but its impact doesn't stop at Gretna. ‘It's right that people in the rest of the United Kingdom make their feelings known. ‘They might not have a vote but they have a voice and it should be heard.’ Families and businesses would face soaring costs in an independent Scotland regardless of what currency is adopted, it was warned yesterday. New research by one of the country's largest firms yesterday cast severe doubt on the SNP's plans for separation and predicts rising costs, higher taxes and deep public spending cuts. A three-month study commissioned by Weir Group from experts at Oxford Economics said the economy 'could succeed' after the referendum in the event of a Yes vote, but it could take around 15 years to achieve. It added that whatever currency is used, Scottish companies are 'likely to face higher funding costs post-independence'. Changing currency could mean 'substantial one-off costs for business, amounting to around £800million'. This is along with 'ongoing transaction costs on businesses and households of around £500million per year'. But it added that even if a currency union with the UK is agreed, it would lead to either higher taxes or public spending cuts of around £9billion a year to meet strict debt ratio requirements. Weir Group is the latest in a number of huge employers - including Standard Life, Lloyds Bank, RBS and Scottish Widows - who have raised concerns about the economic impact of separation. Research yesterday showed that the firms who have expressed alarm over independence employ a total of 50,000 Scots. Weir Group chief executive Keith Cochrane said: 'As a political document, the Scottish Government's White Paper paints a picture of independence as being a risk-free option with only potential benefits. 'However, voters should be aware that what they are being asked to say Yes to carries substantial risks to our economy and therefore to the quality of life of millions of people. The costs of independence are guaranteed but the benefits are uncertain.' Deputy First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said: 'The Weir Group is an important company in Scotland. I actually welcome their contribution to the debate. 'I am looking forward early next month to meeting senior management and staff to discuss these very issues and I hope to reassure them on some of the points they have made.' Scottish Tory leader Ruth Davidson said that with some of Scotland's biggest employers raising 'legitimate concerns' about the economic impact of independence 'the SNP can no longer be so dismissive over their warnings'. Former chancellor Alistair Darling, leader of the pro-UK Better Together campaign, said: 'Yet again, it is clear from a company employing hundreds of Scots that being part of the UK is good for jobs here and it keeps down costs for families in Scotland.

"The U.S. and Iran are now fighting alongside one another in a bid to counter the growing threat ISIS poses in the Middle East. Military expert Joseph Dempsey believes the latest set of aircraft to be delivered to Iraq is Iranian, despite steps being taken to mask its origin. The U.S. has just announced it's sending an additional 300 troops to Iraq, raising its total presence in the war-ravaged country to 750. Those troops will now be working alongside the newly delivered Iranian fighter jets to form an unlikely international military aid package. The aircraft pictured in the footage have several key differences to Russian aircraft of the same type . The serial numbers on the aircraft pictured correspond to numbers on known Iranian fighter jets . Joseph Dempsey also said the aircraft's camouflage scheme was unique from other known militaries . Attempts to conceal imagery were visible - here the colours of the Iranian flag can be seen . Joseph Dempsey, an analyst for the IISS's Military Balance Online publication, said new footage showed Iraq's latest Su-25 Frogfoot attack aircraft originated from Iran. Their arrival follows a delivery of identical aircraft from Russia - but with a number of key distinctions. He said video footage of the fleet showed serial numbers matching those from known Iranian aircraft, while their camouflage scheme was unique and attempts to conceal Iranian insignia were noticeable. 'Although these aircraft were likely delivered to Iraq by Iranian pilots, it is unclear who will now be responsible for crewing and maintaining them. 'Given this recent apparent growth in their Su-25 inventory, it seems increasingly unlikely that Iraq retains the capacity to operate this type of aircraft in any significant number without some level of external support. 'Whilst the presence of Iran-sourced aircraft in Iraq is clearly significant, the exact circumstances surrounding their presence and intended use remain unknown, as does the existence of any wider arrangement between the governments of these neighboring countries to counter the ISIS threat.' Iraq has been vocal in its opposition to ISIS, with public protests held in the capital last week and new reports of drone strikes taking place across its border. Protests took place in Tehran, Iran, last week where the public voiced its concerns about ISIS - it is believed Iran has now supplied fighter jets to assist the Iraqi Government to repel the Islamic extremists . A map shows the areas ISIS aims to include in its caliphate, which include Spain, North Africa and India . Only days ago did ISIS formally announced the creation of its caliphate, or Islamic State, across the territory it holds in Syria and Iraq. Its push across Iraq in recent weeks has been brutal, with more than 2,400 people killed in the month of June alone. The group is responsible for committing a number of mass executions and bloody atrocities during its surge to the edge of the city of Baghdad and has called on all Muslims to join its campaign. Yesterday, the leader of the extremist group called on Muslims to come to the territory his group has seized to help build an Islamic state, declaring: 'The earth is Allah's.' Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi said: 'In this virtuous month or in any other month, there is no deed better than jihad in the path of Allah, so take advantage of this opportunity and walk the path of you righteous predecessors. 'So to arms, to arms, soldiers of the Islamic, fight, fight.'","Expert believes Iraq's latest aircraft delivery is from Iran, not Russia .

Welsh businessman John Hughes. Fearing . an imminent bloody battle, many residents have left the city, and . others were following last night while many businesses have shut down. Ukrainian . National Security and Defence Council deputy head Mykhailo Koval warned . soldiers would impose a 'full blockade' of both Donetsk and Lugansk -- . both capitals of self-styled 'people’s republics'. Koval vowed 'measures that will force the separatists, the bandits to lay down their arms'.

Cities, towns and infrastructure must not be destroyed.' He urged new Kiev president Petro Poroshenko: 'We must avoid suffering and deaths of peaceful people.' Threatened . by harsh new Western sanctions, Vladimir Putin has so far resisted . sending in troops he has stationed in positions close to the border. Separatist . leader Denis Pushilin made an unverified claim that his men had killed . “tens” of Ukrainian soldiers in the eastern coal mining region of . Saur-Mogila, pledging this was a  turning point. 'After . massacring the fascists at Saur-Mogila, I understood the words of one . of my colleagues: we abandoned Slavyansk to take Kiev,' he boasted. But . Poroshenko warned: 'My order is now in effect - tighten the ring around . the terrorists. Continue the operation to liberate Donetsk and Luhansk . regions.' Recent days have seen Ukrainian forces make significant gains, retaking Slavyansk and other key towns from separatist hands. Three female rebel snipers surrendered, say Kiev commanders. But Russia yesterday accused the Ukrainians of using banned cluster munitions in eastern Ukraine. 'This . irresponsible policy of the Ukrainian authorities and their Western . sponsors is only leading to new victims and the civilian population’s . sufferings,' said a statement. Rebels were shelling Luhansk with Grad multiple rocket launchers, said Ukrainian media reports. Ukraine’s . secret service has launched an investigation into senior Vladimir Putin . aide Sergei Glazyev, accusing him of planning 'military operations' and . 'helping terrorists'. The adviser hit back, claiming the SBU intelligence service 'plays the same role as Gestapo did in Nazi Germany'. At a rally in the Donetsk's central . square yesterday, pro-Russian commander, a Muscovite using the name Igor . Strelkov, told thousands of supporters that his men would fight for the . city, which was 'much easier to defend than little Slaviansk'. Businesses have closed down and . thousands of residents are believed to have fled as the fighters fortify . positions and buildings in the city, which they have held for the past . few months. But . the government government pressed what it clearly saw as its advantage, . announcing it had carried out an air strike against rebel fighters who . had attacked the airport in Luhansk, another eastern city, on Sunday. It accused separatists in the area of opening fire in populated areas under the guise of being government forces. 'They . use flags of military paratroopers, Ukrainianian state flags and thus . fool the population,' said military spokesman Oleksiy Dmytrashkivsky. Separatists prepare to steal a tank from the museum using a crane . Tanks very much: The pro-Russian militants raise the T-54 on to a large flat-bed truck .

Slaviansk residents talk to Ukrainian troops on patrol in the city, which had been a rebel stronghold for months . The Defence Ministry said early this . morning that separatists had launched 10 attacks on government posts and . army positions in the previous 24 hours with mortars and small arms. It . gave no details of the incidents or casualties, but said troops had . returned fire: 'The terrorists were given a fitting reply.' The . months-old conflict has already cost the lives of more than 200 . Ukrainian troops, as well as hundreds of civilians and rebel fighters. Separatist . rebellions erupted in mainly Russian-speaking eastern regions of . Ukraine in April following the overthrow of a pro-Russian president in . Kiev in February. It . appeared that the militants had been encouraged to take action after . Moscow annexed the Crimea peninsula in March - leading to speculation . that the Kremlin may have designs on other parts of the country. Rebels . have since then been barricaded into government buildings in Donetsk, . which they declared capital of an independent 'people's republic', but . Slaviansk, with 120,000 people, was their most symbolic stronghold.

"America's painkiller epidemic has been laid bare in its most stark terms to date as a UN report reveals that U.S. citizens abuse more pills than any other country in the world. The United Nation's World Drug Report 2014 shows that 6.1 per cent of American adults, aged between 15 and 64, abused prescribed pain opioids, such as codeine and oxycontin, in 2012. Shockingly, that figure is twice as high as the world's second-worst offender, Australia, where opioid addicts comprise 3.1 per cent of citizens. Epidemic rising: The United Nation's World Drug Report 2014 shows that 6.1 per cent of American adults abused prescribed pain opioids, such as codeine and morphine, in 2012 . 'In the United States, past-year illicit drug use by persons aged 12 years or older reached the highest level in the past 10 years,' the report said, adding: 'The number of deaths resulting from prescriptionpainkiller overdose also continues to rise, especially among women.' It goes on to state that 'medical emergencies related to the non-medical use of pharmaceuticals' skyrocketed by 132 per cent between 2004 and 2011, while with the number of trips to the ER for overdoses of 'opiates and/or opioids' leapt 183 per cent in the same time frame. According to official figures, more than 250 million prescriptions for antidepressants were written for Americans in 2010. Danger: The danger of opioids - such as oxycontin - lies primarily in the fact that they are so highly addictive, say experts . OxyContin, the most infamous of prescription opioids and the main protagonist in the painkiller epidemic, did not come in a tamper-resistant formulation until 2010. By then, it had been implicated in thousands of overdose deaths since it hit the market in 1996 as its earlier formulation allowed users to crush it into a powder to snort or inject. The danger of opioids - which also include Tylenol with Codeine, Empirin with Codeine, Roxanol, Duramorph, Demerol, Percocet, Tylox and Dilaudid - lies primarily in the fact that they are so highly . addictive, say experts. 1. U.S.A. - 6.10% . 2. Australia - 3.40% . 3. Afghanistan - 2.92% . 4. Pakistan - 2.40% . 5. Seychelles - 2.30% . 6. Russia - 2.29% . 7. Iran - 2.27% . 8. United Kingdom - 1.71% . 9. Estonia - 1.53% . 10. Azerbaijan - 1.50% . The Johns . Hopkins Center for Drug Safety and Effectiveness said last year that, by . 2008, 'the annual number of fatal drug poisonings . surpassed those of motor vehicle deaths and overdose deaths attributable . to prescription drugs exceeded those of cocaine and heroin combined.' The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime - who published the report - describe the effect such prescription drugs have on the human body. It's . authors write: 'At the heart of opioid addiction is the powerful . rewarding effect [that triggers] a cascade of intense pleasurable . responses related to the brain dopamine release. 'Users describe an initial rush followed by feelings of warmth, pleasure and sedation. 'Once . regular use is established, vulnerable individuals develop an . uncontrollable compulsive behaviour that is the main characteristic of . opioid dependence, seeking to obtain the substance in spite of any . negative consequence.' It . comes a month after it was revealed that most people who abuse . addictive prescription painkillers get them for free from friends or . relatives, while drug dealers are a relatively uncommon source for those . at highest risk for deadly overdoses. A . government study found that people who abuse most frequently, often 'doctor-shop'; more than 1 in 4 who used these drugs almost daily said . they had been prescribed by one or more physicians. Almost . as many said they got them for free from friends or relatives; only 15 . percent of the most frequent abusers said they bought the drugs from . dealers or other strangers. Those . abusers 'are probably using at much greater volumes and simply asking a . friend for a pill now and then is not going to be sufficient,' said Dr. Leonard Paulozzi, a researcher at the federal Centers for Disease . Control and Prevention.","UN's World Drug Report 2014 shows 6.1% of Americans abuse opioids .

"Click here to read Sportsmail's interview with Liverpool captain Gerrard in full. Brendan Rodgers has confirmed he wants Steven Gerrard to remain at Liverpool and for his captain to be given a contract extension. Gerrard raised the prospect that he could play at another club next season in an interview with Sportsmail on Friday, after revealing that he has yet to receive the offer of a new contract. The 34-year-old's current deal runs out next June and this is the first time he has ever come so close to being out of contract at his boyhood club. Steven Gerrard mentioned the possibility of leaving Liverpool in an interview with Sportsmail on Friday . Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers wants his captain to sign a contract extension to remain at Anfield . Gerrard, pictured in action against Hull, insists he has no plans to retire at the end of this season . Appearances: 9 . Goals: 2 . Assists: 1 . Chances created: 23 . Pass accuracy: 87 per cent . Shot accuracy: 60 per cent . Tackles won: 14 . In our interview, he pointedly said: 'I won't be retiring this summer. I will play beyond this season. We will have to wait and see if that's at Liverpool or somewhere else. That's Liverpool's decision.' Rodgers, however, has made no secret that he believes Gerrard still has a key role to play next season. Speaking to BT Sport before Saturday's match at Newcastle, Rodgers said: 'Steven is a wonderful player. The situation is very simple. I have already spoken with Steven's representative over a week ago so a real productive good conversation and we took that to the ownership and they are obviously now in the process of getting a deal hopefully agreed and done. 'In terms of Steven, he's a player of course we want to keep. He has been a big part of my plans since I have been here. 'I've said it a number of times, he's a player that going forward I still want to very much be a part of my plans so hopefully that can be done very soon.' Gerrard and Rodgers discuss tactics during Liverpool's 0-0 draw with Hull City at Anfield last weekend . Rodgers believes Gerrard, pictured celebrating against Everton, still has a key role to play at Liverpool . If Liverpool do not speak to Gerrard in the next two months, he would be able to begin talks about moving elsewhere on a Bosman from January 1. Liverpool travel to Newcastle this afternoon and a win could potentially take them into the top four, though Rodgers is still trying to find the right blend. It was a summer of significant change at Anfield, following the sale of Luis Suarez and the arrival of nine new players but the manager insisted he had no choice but to break up the squad that finished second in the Barclays Premier League. 'It was not even a bold step (to do that),' said Rodgers. 'It's what we had to do. We couldn't go this season with the same group of players. And also we lost a top player. Mario Balotelli was one of nine summer signings made by Rodgers after the departure of Luis Suarez . 'So some of it had to be done. It was clear we needed to do that and it is clear that some of the young players that have come in, we've see their qualities. It's just going to take them time to adapt.' Rodgers added: 'The players we brought in were not really established. With young players, you get mistakes. Then there is the lifestyle. You have adaptation, new players coming into a different way of life. It may be difficult for other people to understand it because of where we were last season. 'As I said the natural progress of the team was halted a wee bit because we lost a world class talent.' Lazar Markovic, pictured in action against Swansea, is another new player yet to show his best on Merseyside .","Steven Gerrard's contract at Liverpool is due to expire in June next year .

"Trying to find a comfortable way to catch a quick nap on the move is a feat that has eluded even the most experienced traveller. But help could soon be at hand – literally. A new product which allows users to strap a portable pillow to their arms, hands or elbow has now been designed, and which promises to ‘continue the napping revolution’. Scroll down for video . The Ostrich Pillow Mini allows users to strap a portable pillow to their arms, hands or elbow, and rest their heads on desks or against walls . The product has been described as ‘Quality Napping Within Arm’s Reach’, with the designers heralding the ‘cutting-edge design which is intriguingly cool’ The Ostrich Pillow Mini has been created by the same company who developed the Ostrich Pillow - a bizarre invention that looks like a padded balaclava and allows wearers to rest their head and hands inside. The product, which has been designed by a young team of creatives called Studio Banana Things, is currently being advertised on crowdfunding website Kickstarter. The firm initially wanted to raise $15,000 (£9,300) in order to commence production, but just two days after being placed on the Kickstarter website they have already exceeded that amount with donations currently reaching $15,466. The product, which has been designed by a young team of creatives called Studio Banana Things, is currently being advertised on crowdfunding website Kickstarter . The inventors claim it will prove popular with office workers and acceptable with many organisations who ‘understand and acknowledge the correlation between sleep and performance' People who make donations are being offered free Ostrich Pillow Minis in return for their money. It is hoped that the product will be manufactured between the end of October and the beginning of December, with the first batch ready for sale by mid-December. The inventors claim it will also prove popular with office workers and acceptable with many organisations who ‘understand and acknowledge the correlation between sleep and performance, making sleeping at work even more acceptable'. They add that many companies are already ‘taking steps to tackle our sleep deficiencies through introducing state of the art sleep facilities at work’. A slacker's dream: Now pupils can catch up on their sleep while pretending to hit the books . The product has been described as ‘Quality Napping Within Arm’s Reach’, with the designers heralding the ‘cutting-edge design which is intriguingly cool’. They add: ‘It comes in four fashionable colours, resembles a cute cartoon character, or perhaps an ostrich egg, yet fits like a glove and is the grooviest little portable pillow.’ The pillow straps on to users’ arms, elbows or hands, allowing them to rest their head comfortably in a variety of positions either on a desk or table, or against a wall. The invention comes a couple of years after Studio Banana Things, headed by inventor Ali Ganjavian, released the Ostrich Pillow in 2012. No more distractions: The invention was designed to block out any noise or bright lights . The Ostrich Pillow offered a solution for resting for on the go -power naps . The quirky idea is a cross between a luxury pillow and a balaclava which wearers can rest their head and hands inside and which allows users to comfortably nap anywhere they like - whether it's at a desk at work, an airport or on a train. Mr Ganjavian came up with after feeling tired at work. The 35-year-old hopes his latest invention will revolutionise the powernap and prove to be a worldwide hit. The inventor, who was born in Romsey, Hampshire, said recently: 'We spend many hours working all day and sleep is an essential part of our day. 'So I thought why not create a product that can help us unwind at work.' A cheeky work nap: The pillow is designed to give people a place to rest their heads while they snooze . The name is inspired by the way ostriches bury their heads in the sand. Mr Ganjavian, who now lives in Madrid, Spain, said: 'I think it's a useful product that makes you smile whenever you see it.' It has a hole for the wearer's mouth and two 'shelters' above the ears for their hands. The product, which costs £50, proved immediately popular and clocked up 500 sales in its first week. Mr Ganjavian set up his company with a friend from university in 2000. They now have offices in America, France, Spain, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. Previous inventions include the Deskshell, which offers privacy to computer users in open-plan offices.","The Ostrich Pillow Mini promises to 'continue the napping revolution'

"A businessman funded his lavish lifestyle using a £1.6million scam that tricked investors into thinking they were saving the rainforest, a court has heard. Mathew Ames, 38, is accused of persuading a number of people to plough their life savings and pensions into two investment schemes that he claimed would provide 15 per cent annual returns through Sri Lankan teak trees or carbon credit. Instead the Essex-based Forestry for Life and The Investor Club were part of an elaborate Ponzi scheme which Ames used to hire a Lamborghini, rent Caribbean accommodation and make use of an executive lounge at Colombo Airport in Sri Lanka, Isleworth Crown Court was told. Sham: Mathew Ames (left) is accused of setting up a £1.6 million Ponzi scheme. He enlisted the support of celebrities, with former footballer Jack Charlton (right) attending the opening of Forestry for Life . The court heard Ames, of Thundersley in Essex, got well known faces including veteran sports executive Sir Rodney Walker and industry experts to help promote the schemes. The property mogul and charity trustee is one of 20 witnesses called by the prosecution and the court was he had been recruited as chairman of Forestry for Life, but never registered as a director. Former footballer Jack Charlton was among the guests at the opening of Forestry for Life. Prosecutor Stuart Biggs said: 'The method was to create an enticing glossy brochure. It included quotes from Prince Charles, Tony Blair and referenced the Kyoto Protocol and Harvard University. There was an added bonus you were doing something ethical.' He added: 'In truth no investments were made by either company, not a single piece of land was purchased abroad or a tree planted, or money kept safe in a separate account. It was used to pay company expenses, staff, and to support Mr Ames and his lifestyle.' The court also heard that in 2010 Ames bragged to top racing driver David Brabham about how well his companies were doing before any land had even been bought. Ames . said in an email to the sports star: 'David you just caught me out of . the Lamborghini after ordering my new one. I had a meeting about you the . other day and I have opened offices in Dubai, Singapore and Sri Lanka.' Reward: Mathew Ames is accused of using the income from fraudulent businesses to fund a lavish lifestyle, including this home in Thundersley, Essex. He allegedly claimed investors would see 15 per cent returns . Stuart Biggs prosecuting told the jury it was to give the false impression of a successful business to attract investment. City of London investigators found evidence £250,000 was paid out to investors, but it came from other clients’ deposits and not generated by any investment. Mr Biggs added: 'This is often referred to as a Ponzi scheme, taking from Peter to pay Paul out of new creditors’ money that is being shuffled around.' Mr Biggs said while running both companies Ames dishonestly represented what invested money would be used for, the level of return, and misappropriated cash for other uses. The court heard one agent, who also invested, was shown title deeds for land in Brazil which Ames’ companies never bought, while an industry advisor who suggested it may be a Ponzi scheme was sacked. By late 2010 interest payments to clients stopped and both firms were liquidated in March 2011 after the Financial Services Authority got wind of the unregulated investments. Ames was arrested in September that year and denies two counts of fraudulent trading between 2008 and 2011. The trial continues.

"A successful Missouri surgeon has beaten unbelievable odds by returning to the OR after suffering sudden paralysis from the waist down. Dr. Ted Rummel lost his ability to walk or stand when a blood-filled cyst on his spine burst in 2010. A year of intense rehabilitation later, he was back in the game. Rummel even overcame the hindrance of sitting as he worked by utilizing an ingenious stand-up wheel chair. Now, the tenacious orthopedic surgeon can do virtually everything in the OR he previously could and maintains his physical strength with daily exercise and his emotional strength thanks to a deeply devoted family. Scroll down for video . Uplifting: Dr. Ted Rummel is seen working from his stand-up wheelchair. The device allows him to perform soldier surgery, a procedure that requires the doctor be standing . Inspiring: Here, Dr. Rummel is seen in his special chair. A year after he became paralyzed, Rummel was already back in the OR. But his sitting chair left him unable to perform shoulder procedures, his favorite surgery . Paging Doctor Rummel: Dr. Ted Rummel is a an orthopedic surgeon in Missouri and performs his operations on joints from a wheelchair . Tenacious: The tenacious doctor lost his ability to walk when a cyst burst in his spine. A year of grueling rehabilitation later, he was right back in the OR repairing joints and improving lives . Rummel told the Enquirer that his freedom despite his disabilities have been a lifesaver. ‘When I’m able to do this, and I can get a piece of my life back, it’s huge,’ he said. ‘It’s so special.’ But the miraculous outcome wasn’t always a sure thing. The surgeon’s troubles began in 2009 when he was diagnosed with a cavernous hemangioma, a type of blood-filled sac, on his spine. Doctors fearful they might cause him immediate paralysis opted not to operate. He lived with the cyst for 11 months until September 2010, when the sac ruptured and the necessary surgery he underwent thereafter left him numb from the waist down. Suddenly Rummel, who practices in O’Fallon, Missouri, found himself going from performing 1,000 surgeries per year to not knowing if he’d ever work again. ‘One of my first thoughts was, “Oh my gosh, my life as I know it was erased,”’ he recalls. ‘Who you are out of the OR is gone and you have to redefine yourself.’ But the dedicated physician soon came to his senses and decided he’d be back in the OR no matter what it took. A year later, that’s exactly what he did. The first surgery he undertook was watched over by another surgeon in case Rummel needed help. But he never did. ‘Very quickly it was apparent that . his skills were still there,’ said Ann Abad, of Progress West Healthcare . Center, where Rummel works. Rummel began performing all the procedures he could from a sitting wheelchair: on hands, elbows, feet, ankles, and knees. But he couldn’t perform he favorite surgery, on shoulders, because it required him to be standing up. Undeterred, he beat that problem, too. Loving family: Here, Ted Rummel hugs his wife, Kathy, before going into the operating room. Rummel credits his wife for and family for helping him overcome his disability . On the job: Dr. Rummel is able to repair knees, elbows and other joints while sitting in his wheelchair. He uses a special standup wheelchair to repair shoulders, which requires the patient to be sitting up . 'It¿s just been a very powerful experience': Rummel briefly feared for his future--professional and personal--after he fell ill. But he quickly came to his senses and started on the long road to recovery and continued success as a surgeon . Now when the doctor performs shoulder surgery he does so strapped into a wheelchair that keeps him in an upright position. So where does the doctor get his incredible strength? It’s not just from his rigorous workouts. ‘I . have found the key is to communicate with family and loved ones. I got . to know my family again, and I regret the time I wasted,’ he says. ‘The . entire thing has made me phenomenally better with my family. It’s just . been a very powerful experience.’ Specifically, he credits his wife Kathryn. Admirable: 'I had a profession, was well-educated, had resources, family and colleagues to support me,¿ he says. ¿I know so many don¿t have any of this, and I wrestle with how I can help others. One day I will.' ‘I wouldn’t have made it through any of this if it wasn’t for my wonderful wife,’ he says. ‘I am so grateful for her and my family, who I’ve gotten to know all over again.’ Rummel admits there are hard times, but he’s intent on looking toward the bright side and focus on doing good in the world. ‘When this happened to me, I had a profession, was well-educated, had resources, family and colleagues to support me,’ he says. ‘I know so many don’t have any of this, and I wrestle with how I can help others. One day I will.’","Dr. Ted Rummel, an orthopedic surgeon in O'Fallon, Missouri, was suddenly paralyzed in 2010 when a blood-filled cyst burst in his spine .

Their last engagement was at a jobs fair at Sony Studios on behalf of Service Nation: Mission Serve - a programme honouring members of the armed services, at which William thanked Los Angeles for welcoming him and his new wife. He said: 'As this is my last opportunity before we leave this afternoon, I would just say, on behalf of us both, how grateful we are to have been welcomed so warmly in the Golden State and the City of Angels. Thank you so much.' They have enjoyed an action-packed tour that has seen them take part in casual events, where their ease as a couple and love for one another was on frequent display, to the more formal, allowing William to show his statesman qualities. That's my boy! Prince William gives a speech at the job fair, and it seems to go down well with his wife Kate who applauds . Impressed: William warms up for his speech at the Service Nation: Mission Serve event which helps get ex-servicemen into employment; he spoke of how he and Kate both had friends in the UK who could benefit from such a scheme . All smiles: The final leg of the royal visit saw William and Kate attend a job fair designed to get ex-servicemen back into work . Among the highlights in Canada were a dragon boat race and a game of street hockey while the Duke . was able to show off his piloting skills, landing a Sea King . helicopter on water for the first time. At their final event in the U.S., for Service Nation: Mission Serve, the . royal couple arrived in a motorcade with an escort of 17 officers from . the Californian Highway Patrol - affectionately known as Chips - who had . British flags fixed to the back of their large bikes. Service Nation: Mission Serve is an umbrella organisation set up by the U.S. government which . brings together different service charities to support the . re-integration of servicemen and women into civilian life. Proud moment: William, who is a service officer, spoke highly of the workshop and hopes it can inspire veterans in their careers . Helping hand: William and his wife Kate help prepare care packages for military children . William and Kate were greeted by Sir Howard . Stringer, chairman and chief executive of Sony Corporation, and then led . inside a building for a 25 minute-long private meeting with the senior . staff from the programme. In . Sound Stage 15, a huge 42,000 square foot open-plan building, dozens of . business recruitment stands for the former U.S. servicemen and women were . set up. Sets from iconic . movies were built in the huge area, ranging from the yellow brick road from the . Wizard of Oz to elements of the latest Spiderman movie.  Sir Paul . McCartney has used it as a rehearsal space. The . royal couple were cheered by the ex-servicemen and women and their . partners who were attending the fair when they arrived, and the couple . did a short walkabout. Worthy cause: William boxes USO care packages in a scheme he hopes can be adopted, and acted upon, in Britain while Kate looks on, her usual radiant self . Packed out: William made the audience laugh when he joked that his brother, Harry, was a 'low-flying Apache very average brother' On stage, with an enormous 60ft . American flag in the background, the Duke said: . 'This is the last event on our tour of North America, but to my mind, it . is one of the most important. 'This . is because it is about men and women who - of their own free will - . choose to put their life on the line for their country.' He . added: ""Service Nation: Mission Serve, and all the companies and . employers taking part today, are providing opportunities which mean . something very immediate and personal to us. 'Catherine and I both have friends back in Britain who could benefit from a brilliant initiative like this.' William made the audience laugh by . taking a swipe at his brother Prince Harry: 'I am delighted, therefore, . that our Foundation – and in that I include my low-flying Apache very . average brother – is a partner in today’s event.' Before heading to the airport they stopped at the charity, the Tusk Trust, where they met author Kristin Gore, actress Reece Witherspoon and heiress Jessica de Rothschild . William gets a good reaction from one of his jokes as he and Kate meet Charlie Mayhew, chief executive of the Tusk Trust, and director Meredith Ogilvie-Thompson . Kate chats to donors to the Tusk Trust, Ernie and Diane Burgess. Prince William is the royal patron for the charity which used their visit to launch the Trust's U.S. Patron Circle . William went on to tell the audience 'how grateful we are to have been welcomed so warmly in the Golden State and the City of Angels. Thank you so much'. The couple then filled boxes given to youngsters whose parents have been deployed to Afghanistan. William and Kate were first shown a teddy bear called Cuzzie who was dressed in a scarf, goggles, jacket that was one of the main items. The royal couple stood next to each other and filled the package with a journal for the children to jot down their feelings,dogtags, so they can be just like mum or dad, a DVD that takes them through the issues around deployment, and postcards to send to the frontline. When William picked up the popular American toy - Uno playing card - he said: 'I haven't seen these in ages, I used to play this a lot,' then put it in the box. The couple then left for their BA flight back to the UK. The Duke and Duchess took part in an impromptu walkabout outside their residence in LA to the delight of fans who posed for pictures with Kate . Kate speaks to the parent of a girl who appears a little bashful at meeting the Duchess . The crowds weren't as big in the U.S. as they were in Canada, but there were sufficient people to make the couple feel welcome . Full steam ahead: Kate cracks on with a drawing at the Inner-City Arts centre, but William was a little slower off the mark, looking as though he was asking for advice . Coming along nicely: Kate overseas the tortoise operation whilst in the background William seems mesmerised by the shell . Glamour: The couple looked spectacular as they joined Hollywood royalty for a red carpet event while, left, Kate and Nicole Kidman dazzle in their floor-length gowns . Nicole Kidman appears starstruck, smiling as she listens intently to Prince William... but then she breaks into a laugh as the prince pulls a face . Big moment: Kate talks to Tom Hanks and his wife Rita, left, while Jennifer Lopez puts a hand on William and listens intently while the Duchess laughs in the background .","The couple wrap up their action-packed trip to North America with a visit to two charity projects .

"The mistress of the philandering French President has denied claims that she is four months pregnant. Actress Julie Gayet, 41, was said to be expecting Francois Hollande’s baby in June, according to unconfirmed reports by a French blogger who claimed the source was a journalist at the respected M6 television news channel. Mr Hollande, 59, has been sneaking off on his scooter for nights of passion with Miss Gayet in an apartment 150 yards from the Elysee Palace, where he lives with partner Valerie Trierweiler. Pregnant? Actress Julie Gayet, 41, is said to have spent several nights with French President Francois Hollande . Rumours: A Twitter post apparently by the Le Reel website claims Julie Gayet is four months pregnant . A translation of the post reads: 'Julie Gayet is four months pregnant according to a source close of Francois Hollande at L'elysee, information confirmed by a journalist at M6.' Miss Gayet has since denied being pregnant - but not before the claim spread across the Internet following a . post on Twitter from a French blogger called Le Reel. And . it quickly began to gain momentum, with former Tory MP Louise Mensch writing: . ‘French blogger tweeting source says Gayet 4 months pregnant; Valerie . evidently not First Lady any more.’ A spokesman for M6 denied ‘any knowledge’ of the rumour. An Elysee Palace spokesman said he had ‘no comment’ on ‘such a matter’. Miss Trierweiler, 48, has been in hospital since Friday suffering from ‘extreme shock’ over the affair revelations. But . in a press conference yesterday, Mr Hollande made no mention of his . partner of seven years, refusing to say whether she was still First Lady . and furiously denouncing questions about his ‘painful’ love life. Addressing the nation, he proclaimed himself ‘totally indignant’ that his affair had been exposed. 'Distraught' Miss Trierweiler, 48, was admitted for treatment following the publication of photographs of the French leader sneaking in and out of his love-nest on the back of a moped . Waving . his hands in frustration, he said it was a private matter which of the . women was now his partner at the Elysee Palace – a role that is . estimated to cost French taxpayers £70,000 a month. He contemptuously indicated he would make up his mind before a state visit to Washington just before Valentine’s Day. At . a scheduled twice-yearly press conference, the first question was: . ‘Valerie Trierweiler, is she still today the First Lady of France?’ Mr . Hollande pointedly refused to back his long-term love, saying only: . ‘Each and every one of us, in their personal lives, can go through . difficult periods. And that’s our case. They are painful moments. ‘But . I have one principle, which is that private matters are dealt with . privately, within a respectful intimacy. So therefore it is neither the . time or the place to do so.’ He . added he would answer ‘any questions on this particular subject’ ahead . of his state visit to Barack and Michelle Obama on February 11. French President Francois Hollande has refused to answer whether his long-term girlfriend Valerie Trierweiler is still France's First Lady . As he faced the world's media for the first time since the news broke, the 59-year-old remained tight-lipped during questioning from journalists . Intriguingly, an Elysee Palace spokesman would not say to today whether Mr Hollande had even visited his de fact first lady in hospital, where Ms Trierweiler has so far spent four nights . The Prime Minster made it clear at Elysee Palace press conference in Paris that he had not made up his mind who he wanted to be with. He said: 'Everyone of us can go through difficult . periods in our personal life  and that is our case. They are painful . moments, but I have one principle and that is that private matters are . dealt with privately within a respectful intimacy. Therefore it is . nether the time nor the place to do so.' Asked if he would tighten France's already very strict privacy laws, Mr Hollande said: 'No, I am against changing laws for personal convenience. 'But my outrage is total. We are a country of great freedoms in France, but we do have a respect for private life and for human dignity.' In words which may be considered extremely cruel by both women, Mr Hollande even confirmed that the presidential partner had 'no official status' in France, and he was determined to keep costs down, whoever was confirmed as first lady. When questioned if his security had ever been compromised as suggested by some reports about his affair, Mr Hollande answered: 'When I travel officially and when I travel on a private basis, I have protection that is less suffocating. But I am protected everywhere.' When . later in the two-hour press conference he was asked again who the . French First Lady was, he lost his cool, telling 600 assembled . journalists from around the world he deplored last week’s expose of his . infidelity in French Closer magazine. ‘My . outrage is total. I am totally indignant, and it is not only personally . that I’m indignant – it is a violation that affects a fundamental . freedom, and could involve all of you,’ he said, pointing. ‘We are a country of great freedoms in France, but we do have a respect for private life and for human dignity.’ French . journalists failed to grill him on why he had chosen to have his trysts . in an apartment which has links to the Corsican mafia. And . he was let off lightly about the fact that Miss Trierweiler, as First . Lady, has five members of staff, her own chauffeur and the use of . private jets and limousines. In . words which may be considered extremely cruel by some, unmarried Mr . Hollande claimed the presidential partner had ‘no official status’ in . France, and said he was determined to keep costs down, whoever was . confirmed as First Lady. The role was just a ‘habit’, he suggested. But he did acknowledge that  Miss Trierweiler was on the public payroll and said: ‘For me, what is essential is transparency.’ Despite . Mr Hollande’s protestations of an ‘invasion’ of privacy, Miss . Trierweiler has been supplying daily briefings on her condition in . hospital to French newspaper Le Parisien. She told the paper she was ready to forgive her partner, if only he would make his intentions clear quickly. Yesterday . the newspaper claimed Mr Hollande wanted to announce his separation . from Miss Trierweiler – for whom he left the mother of his four children . – but is scared to do so while she is in hospital. Today in answer to a question from a journalist about the Closer magazine photos Mr Hollande said he is outraged by the violation of his privacy, but says he will not sue . Mr Hollande added that 'my indignation is total' and the report is a 'violation that touches a personal liberty' French president Francois Hollande gives a press conference to present his 2014 policy plans at the Elysee presidential palace in Paris . As Mr Hollande spoke to the world's press this mock-up appeared on the internet of the prime minster wearing a helmet Photoshopped over his head, similar to the one he was seen wearing in Closer magazine . A tweet from journalist Andrew Neil questioning the French First Lady's status . ‘Some . have advised him to make an announcement of a split, but the . hospitalisation of Valerie Trierweiler convinced him to give it time,’ one friend told the publication. An Elysee Palace spokesman would not say whether Mr Hollande had visited Miss Trierweiler in hospital. There . is nothing physically wrong with her, but she said Mr Hollande’s . confession of cheating was like ‘being hit by a high-speed train’, and . she is desperate to win public sympathy. Bizarrely, though, it is Mr Hollande whose public ratings have risen as a result of the scandal – among women at least. An . opinion poll for Le Nouvel Observateur magazine showed his approval . among women had jumped from 23 per cent in December to 26 per cent now. It has been claimed the pair met at a £2.5million Paris love nest, registered to writer and actor Michel Ferracci . Julie Gayet (left) with Emmanuelle Hauck (right). The flat is registered to Ferracci, who is a former lover of the French actress Hauck, who now uses the flat with their children . Meanwhile, . despite being highly recognisable as one of France’s  most famous film . stars, divorced Miss Gayet has gone into hiding. The actress, who has . starred in several erotic movies in the past, has two teenage sons. Her . ex-husband, Argentine screenwriter Santiago Amigorena, 51, yesterday . described her as ‘very calm and confident’ as she hid away from the . media storm. He said . she was a ‘sublime actress, who works a lot, a mother who cares for her . children,’ insisting there was ‘no fault, no deception’ on her part. She has indicated that she is prepared to forgive President Francois Hollande for his affair with an actress, even though she felt she had been 'hit by a high speed train' when first told about it. But Elysee Palace sources in turn said Ms Trierweiler solely wanted to hold on to a position which ensured her wealth, fame and huge public influence . Trierweiler (left) became Mr Hollande’s live-in . girlfriend following his separation from Segolene Royal, the mother of . his four children. But her place in the president’s affections have been . taken by Julie Gayet (right) These black and white photographs show a topless Julie Gayet in a photo shoot in 1998 . Since . early last year, Mr Hollande has been making visits to his love nest on . the back of a moped, using a crash helmet as a disguise.

"Muslim fundamentalists are plotting to take over state schools, according to leaked documents. Activists have launched a campaign to oust headteachers using dirty tricks such as spreading false allegations and packing governing bodies with their supporters. The plot, which ringleaders have named Operation Trojan Horse, has emerged in documents drawn up by the group and leaked to a local newspaper. The dossier names several schools in the Birmingham area as targets of alleged plots. The authors of the documents discuss extending the ‘jihad’ operation to Bradford and Manchester – cities with rapidly growing Muslim populations. Investigation: There have been allegations of faked resignation letters at Adderley Primary School in Birmingham, possibly connected to a reported Trojan Horse operation by Islamic fundamentalists . Last night Birmingham City Council . said it had launched an urgent probe to establish the authenticity of . the documents, which are understood to name up to 12 schools. The . investigation is being monitored by police and the Department for . Education, which said it would not hesitate to take ‘firm action’ against those involved. The . Mail understands Education Secretary Michael Gove met the leader of . Birmingham City Council last month to discuss the documents. Apparently . written by fundamentalist Salafist Muslims, the papers outline a . five-point guide to forcing out a headteacher and installing supporters . in key positions to ensure a school is run according to Islamic . principles. This involves identifying state schools in Muslim areas which are underperforming and at risk of being turned into academies. Under the academies programme, schools are removed from local council oversight. Assemblies were allegedly carried out in Park View School promoting radical Muslim clerics with links to terrorism and extremist views . One . passage reads: ‘We have caused a great amount of organised disruption . in Birmingham and as a result we now have our own academies and are on . our way to getting rid of more headteachers and taking over their . schools. ‘Whilst . sometimes the practices we use may not seem the correct way to do things . you must remember this is a “jihad” and as such all means possible to . win the war is acceptable.’ One . head, who is understood to have resigned following a plot to oust him, . said last night his decision to quit had been ‘vindicated’. Balwant . Bains, former headmaster of Saltley School, said he was unable to . comment directly on the claims but confirmed he had been forced to leave . his job. But he said . last night: ‘It was a difficult situation. I had to leave. It’s a tough . time. I am trying to move away from a very horrible, horrible . experience, and I am pleased that it has been exposed.’ Another . headteacher targeted by the extremist group is understood to have been . the victim of unfounded allegations that she was encouraging pupils to . cheat in their SATs exams. Linked: Saltley school was also named in the documents . The . documents are understood to refer to the group having ‘planted the . seed’ of the allegations in order to undermine headmistress Tina . Ireland. The . allegations against Miss Ireland resulted in her pupils’ SATs results . being cancelled. Soon afterwards she resigned from her job at Regents . Park Primary. At a . third named school, Adderley Primary, police have launched a fraud . investigation into claims from four staff members that supposed employee . resignation letters had been faked. A . fourth school, Park View Academy, which is headed by Lindsey Clark, was . given a snap Ofsted inspection this week after claims were raised of . unfair treatment of non-Muslim staff. That . school said in a statement last night: ‘Although we are not aware of . any such campaign actually being carried out in relation to Park View, . we are of course concerned about the school potentially being targeted . for such action. ‘We remain on alert for any such conduct, and will act appropriately.’ The Trojan Horse documents have been leaked to media outlets including the Birmingham Mail. Similar documents have since been sent to several head teachers. The council investigation involves several departments, including legal, audit, human resources and education. A . spokesman said: ‘We have received letters making allegations in . relation to some schools in the Birmingham area. Birmingham City Council . is continuing to investigate these allegations and therefore cannot . comment further.’ Lindsey Clark, Park View's executive head, reportedly said faith classes were being organised, but for after-school lessons . West Midlands Police is being kept updated on the inquiry. Chief . Superintendent, Alex Murray, commander of East Birmingham police, said: . ‘In December 2013 Birmingham City Council brought the content of a . letter they were investigating to the attention of West Midlands Counter . Terrorism Unit requesting we make an assessment of whether any criminal . offences had been committed. ‘The . assessment at that time and remains the case today is that the . allegations in the letter were for further investigation by Birmingham . City Council and the Department for Education and were not a matter for . the police. ‘The city . council has continued to keep us updated on their enquiry in the event . that any findings either warrant police investigation or impact on our . joint delivery of Prevent (anti-extremism strategy) across the city.’ A . Department for Education spokesman said: ‘We are aware of the serious . allegations made in relation to some local authority schools and an . academy in Birmingham, and are in close contact with a number of . parties, including the police, the council and teaching unions. ‘Birmingham City Council is investigating all these allegations and we are also looking specifically at the Park View Academy. ‘All schools are subject to a tough inspection framework and must meet the high standards and requirements rightly expected. ‘We . will not hesitate to take firm action if these are not being met – in . particular where we become aware of issues of concern in an academy we . will move quickly to resolve these.’ The Trojan Horse documents appear to be correspondence between a Birmingham-based Muslim fundamentalist and an acquaintance in Bradford. They outline a five-point guide for taking over a school and encourage expanding the operation to Bradford and then Manchester. The recipient is first urged to identify any Salafi parents – Muslim fundamentalists – sending pupils to the school. ‘They are always the most committed to the faith and are hardliners in that regard and once charged up they keep going for longer,’ the documents say. ‘When the parents have been identified, we start to turn them against the headteacher and leadership team. ‘The only way to do this is to tell each parent that the school is corrupting their children with sex education, teaching about homosexuals, making their children pray Christian prayers and mixed swimming and sport. ‘If you can get them to be very vocal in the playground as they drop off or pick up their children that will stir up other parents. ‘The parents MUST be given direction and told not to discuss this with anyone, you only need a maximum of four parents to disrupt the whole school, to send in complaints to question their child’s education and to contact their MP and local authority.’ Plot: It was claimed that fundamentalists 'planted the seed' that the head of Regents Park Primary, pictured, had encouraged pupils to cheat in exams . Further steps are to ‘parachute in’ Muslim governors to ‘drip-feed our ideal for a Muslim school’ and . galvanise staff to urge the council to investigate the school. The document stresses the importance of having ‘an English face among the staff group to make it more believable’. Anonymous letters should then be circulated to MPs, press and ministers. The . documents state: ‘All these things will work toward wearing the head . down, removing their resolve and weakening their mindset so they . eventually give up.’ The . documents state: ‘Operation Trojan Horse has been very carefully . thought through and is tried and tested within Birmingham, implementing . it in Bradford will not be difficult for you.’ The . operation, the papers say, has been fine-tuned so that it is ‘totally . invisible to the naked eye and allows us to operate under the radar’. They . go on: ‘I have detailed the plan we have in Birmingham and how well it . has worked and you will see how easy the whole process is to get the . headteacher out and our own person in.’ State . schools with poor Ofsted reports and with large Muslim pupil . populations should be targeted for takeover, the writer says: ‘The poor . performing schools are easy to disrupt, the better performing with . strong head teachers are much harder and so we have to manufacture a . strong enough reason, but rest assured we have not failed yet, no matter . how difficult removing the head teacher may be. ‘You just have to be clever and find the most appropriate way to deal with the school.’ The . documents add: ‘This is all about causing the maximum amount of . organised chaos and we have fine-tuned this as part of operation Trojan . Horse. You must identify what the heads’ strengths are and build a case . of disruption around that.’ Salafi . Islam is a strong fundamentalist version of the faith that seeks to rid . itself of modern-day ‘impurities’. Followers believe in strict . adherence to the Koran. They . argue worshippers have lost touch with the true nature of the religion . and want to revert to the ancient form of Islam. Salafi comes from the . root word ‘ancestors’.","Birmingham city council has warned of an alleged dirty tricks campaign .

"A British pensioner was sentenced to death for drug smuggling by an Egyptian court yesterday. The Foreign Office said it was ‘extremely concerned’ about the sentence passed on 74-year-old Charles Raymond Ferndale, said to be a graduate of the Royal College of Art and Oxford University. He was originally sentenced to death on April 7 with four other men. Arrested: Charles Raymond Ferndale, a 74-year-old British sailor is . among five people sentenced to death in Egypt for drug smuggling. Two of the Seychellois involved in the drug trafficking case: Ronny Jean, . left, Yvon Vinda, centre and Dean Loze . The sentences were confirmed by a . court in Hurghada, a tourist city on the Red Sea coast, yesterday where a . fine of 85million Egyptian pounds (£8million) was also imposed. Executions in Egypt are usually carried out by hanging. Ferndale, who is said to divide his . time between the UK and Pakistan, was accused of attempting to smuggle . three tons of the cannabis product hashish, worth almost £3million, in . 118 bags into Egypt aboard his boat and being part of an ‘international . gang’. Dean Loze, the other Seychellois national convicted on charges of drug trafficking in Egypt . The pensioner, three men from the . Seychelles and one from Pakistan were arrested by armed police aboard a . vessel near the Red Sea coastal town of Marsa Alam in 2011. The Pakistani man is said to have fled the scene and to have been sentenced to death in absentia. Positioned in south-eastern Egypt, and located on the western shore of . the Red Sea, Marsa Alam is a popular spot for tourists and in particular . yachts and sailors. Egyptian investigators said that they . boarded Ferndale’s vessel and discovered the hashish hidden and in . sacks disguised as food supplies. Some reports described the vessel as a yacht, others a small ship. A Foreign Office spokesman said: ‘We are opposed to the death penalty in all circumstances. Our consular team in Cairo are in contact with the British prisoner and we will do our utmost to prevent this execution.’ Ferndale, who is said to have been . living mostly in the Pakistan port city of Karachi, and those convicted . with him are expected to lodge an appeal against the sentence within the . next 28 days. Egyptian officials said yesterday . they believed the bags of hashish had originated in Pakistan although a . spokesman in the capital Islamabad said it was unaware of the case. Anti-death penalty campaigner Kim Manning Cooper, of Amnesty International UK, said: ‘This is extremely worrying news. ‘The death penalty is cruel and . unnecessary in all circumstances, but international standards clearly . stipulate that capital punishment should never be imposed in non-lethal . cases like this one. ‘We will be pressing for the sentence against Mr Ferndale and the others in this case to be commuted. ‘Executions were something we saw . almost every year in Egypt during Hosni Mubarak’s long authoritarian . rule. Egypt should immediately impose a complete moratorium on the death . penalty.’ Arrest: The case dates back to 2011 when four of the defendants were arrested on board a ship near the Red Sea coastal town of Marsa Alam . Fine: The court in the city of Hurghada also imposed a fine of 85 million Egyptian pounds (£850,000) Amnesty claims that 91  people were . sentenced to death in Egypt last year, although it is not thought that . anyone has been executed for two years. There have been no executions of Europeans for more than 20 years, officials in Cairo said. There is also concern over fair . trials in the country. A recent report claims that some 1,100 people . failed to get a fair trial from the Egyptian courts in the past year. In recent years, Ferndale has written . for both the British and Pakistani media on subjects including . terrorism, Al Qaeda, Osama Bin Laden, the Middle East and Afghanistan. He claims to have a degree from the Institute of Psychiatry in London and lists his occupation as charity worker. The other men convicted in Egypt were . named as Ronny Norman Jean, 41, Yvon John Vinda, 38, Dean Dominic Loze, . 27, all from the Seychelles, and Munawar Saeed Khan, 44, from Pakistan. Ferndale’s case mirrors in some ways the plight of British grandmother Lindsay Sandiford. She is in a Bali jail having been . sentenced to death – by firing squad – after being convicted of trying . to smuggle cocaine on to the holiday island in May 2012. The 56-year-old is appealing against the death sentence.","Court ruled Charles Raymond Ferndale was part of 'an international gang'

"Families of those killed in the tragic Lockerbie bombing 25 years ago today have gathered in the Scottish town for a memorial service. The mourners, whose loved ones were killed when Pan Am flight 103 was struck by a terrorist bomb as it passed over Scotland, were joined by politicians, officials and members of the local community. Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond, a representative of the US government attended the service, held for the 270 people who died when the flight, headed from London to New York City, was struck by a bomb and crashed to the ground. Remembrance: A family attend the memorial service in Dryfesdale cemetary in Lockerbie, southern Scotland . Sadness: Mourners attended the service, and were joined by representatives of the Scottish Government, the US Government and the Queen . Sombre: Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond highlighted the importance of remebering the 'harrowing events' of 1988 . The service was led by the Rev John MacLeod, while readings and prayers were given by Major Kingsley Layton, commanding officer at Lockerbie Corps, the Salvation Army, and Lord Lieutenant Jean Tulloch, representing the Queen. US government representative Craig Lynes said: 'We gather today to remember each of the lives that were lost in this tragic event of December 21, 1988. 'Families, friends, it is you who bear the heaviest of hearts. While our words can do little to repair the damage caused by this act of terrorism, we offer them with hope. 'We offer these words as a tribute to the 270 lives that were cut short that evening, we offer them as a way to help carry their lives forward as we continue ours. 'Your ability to move on from this incident to create your own families, yet remember the loved ones lost, is an encouragement to those who witness your tenacity. 'The comfort and reassurance you have given each other over the years is an inspiration to anyone who has known such loss. Crash: Emergency workers arrive at the scene where the plane had crashed, killing 270 people . Crash site: Police remove a body from the wreckage after Pan Am flight 103 exploded over Lockerbie . Crater: Debris from the plane cut through the ground in Lockerbie, killing 11 people on the ground . Reconstruction: The surviving pieces of the Boeing 747 craft, which were reassembled in a warehouse . 'From the callous and the cowardly acts committed throughout history by those who attempt to strike terror in our hearts and minds, comes the resolve and strength to continue to fight and prevent organisations and individuals from committing such atrocities. 'We stand together united in our search for justice.' Speaking just before the service, Lord Wallace told BBC news: 'There are families who suffered a huge loss at the time, and it changed their lives forever. I don't think we should ever forget what man's inhumanity to man does. 'I saw the signs of a community that was trying to build on the bonds of community. I think they have taken tremendous strides to ensure that real sense of community is here.' Tribute: A hand-written card was one of the items attached to the wreaths laid at a memorial stone at the cemetery . Service: US government representative Craig Lynes said: 'While our words can do little to repair the damage caused by this act of terrorism, we offer them with hope' Pan Am flight 103 was on its way from London to New York when it exploded above Lockerbie, in southern Scotland, on the evening of December 21 1988, killing everyone on board and 11 people on the ground. Today Mr Salmond said: 'On this 25-year anniversary, and as the country prepares once more to relive the harrowing events of that terrible night, it is important that we remember that the pain and suffering of the families and friends of those who died has endured since that winter night in 1988.' Prime Minister David Cameron said: 'To families, friends, neighbours, loved ones and all those caught up in the painful process of recovery, let us say to them: our admiration for you is unconditional; for the fortitude and resilience you have shown; for your determination never to give up. 'You have shown that terrorist acts cannot crush the human spirit. That is why terrorism will never prevail. 'And even in the darkest moments of grief, it is possible to glimpse the flickering flame of hope.' Respectful: Lord Lieutenant Jean Tulloch, centre left, the Queen's representative, appears alongside servicemen as she attends the wreath-laying ceremony . Reaching out: A woman who attended the ceremony reaches out to touch a memorial stone inscribed with the names of those who died . Only one man, Abdelbaset al-Megrahi, was convicted of the bombing. He was found guilty in January 2001 and given a life sentence. He was diagnosed with prostate cancer in 2008, leading to a decision to free him under compassionate release rules. The Lockerbie bombing in 1988 killed more people than any other terrorist act over UK soil. An explosive which was smuggled into the plane's luggage compartment exploded in mid-air, tearing a hole in the fuselage and sending the plane plummeting towards the ground. When it landed, all 243 passengers, 16 crew members and 11 people on the ground in Lockerbie were killed. The 103 Pan Am flight had originated in Frankfurt, and passengers switched planes at London Heathrow from a Boeing 272 plane to a 747. The plane had been airborne for a little less than an hour when it lost contact with ground control. Minutes later another aircraft sent in a report of flames on the ground above Lockerbie. The impact of falling sections of the plane destroyed several houses. There were no survivors. Scottish Justice Secretary Kenny MacAskill took that decision on August 20 the following year, sparking a row among politicians on both sides of the Atlantic. Megrahi died in Tripoli, Libya in May last year. Despite the guilty verdict and Megrahi's decision to drop a subsequent appeal against conviction, politicians, campaigners and families of victims are still dealing with the impact, and some of the British relatives are considering another appeal against his conviction when they meet with lawyers in the new year. During the service Reverend Macleod said: 'It is 25 years after the day on which certain men chose to set aside their humanity and destroy the lives of 270 people in the air over this area of Scotland and here in the little town of Lockerbie; not only their lives but also those who survived, families and friends. 'What we the people of Lockerbie in this area will never tire of saying is we welcome you once again to this place where you know you are always welcome. In doing so we seek to comfort and console you.' US Consulate General in Edinburgh Zoja Bazarnic, who also attended the ceremony, said it is important to mark the tragedy. 'I . think, 25 years on, there were so many lives that were affected by that . and it was very important and meaningful for my colleagues and I to be . here today to pay our respects to the victims but also to share our . thoughts and prayers with the families and the people of Lockerbie,' he . said. Jane Schultz lost her 20-year-old son Thomas, who was part of a group of Syracuse University students on board the flight. Today she said: 'In my heart, to me this is home and there was no other place I felt I should be on this very sad and special occasion. 'I . wanted to be here to honour my son as well as the 269 other victims and . to be in the place where he took his last breath,"" she said. Memorial: A stone dedicated to Thomas Schultz in Lockerbie . 'I thought the service was very meaningful and the weather co-operated with us. The service was just really spot on. 'I . try to get back to Lockerbie at least every two years because to me . it's home. It's nice and peaceful and it's where Thomas was, so it's . like coming home.'","Loved ones of victims told: 'The comfort and reassurance you have given each other over the years is an inspiration'

"A cosmetic surgeon struck off the medical register for a series of botched operations has been allowed to treat patients again while a review of his case is scheduled. A medical tribunal found Dr Olufemi Adeyinka Adeogba was unfit to practise last December. But the High Court has since reinstated his name on the medical register, allowing the surgeon to practise without any restrictions. Meanwhile, judges have ordered the General Medical Council (GMC) to reinvestigate the allegations against him. The GMC is going to the Court of Appeal to have the original decision reinstated, raising serious concerns over patient safety. Cosmetic surgeon Dr Olufemi Adeyinka Adeogba was deemed unfit to practise and struck off the medical register in December after a medical tribunal found he left patients like Rita Nugent, above left and right, disfigured after surgery . Ms Nugent, 31, paid £2,200 for her nose job but soon realised there was a problem when her nose caved in . GMC chief executive Niall Dickson said: 'Drr Adeogba faced very serious charges which the MPTS panel found proved. 'We believe the panel's decision to stop him from practising medicine was the right one and was necessary to protect patients. 'Following a legal challenge from the doctor, the High Court referred the matter back to the panel. 'However, we remain of the view that the original decision was correct and are now taking the case to the Court of Appeal. 'We are here to protect the public and make sure that doctors who treat patients are safe to do so.' The decision to remove Dr Adeogba from the medical register followed an investigation into complaints from patients, left disfigured after procedures carried out by the Merseyside-based surgeon. A Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service (MPTS) panel heard one patient was left with a dented breast, and her nipples too high. When she begged Dr Adeogba for help, he told her to wear a supportive bra. Another patient's nipple turned black after he failed to warn her of the dangers of tissue necrosis if she continued her 12-a-day smoking habit after her operation. Rita Nugent, 31, ended up disfigured after paying what she thought was a bargain £2,200 for a nose job. She said things started to go wrong almost immediately after her surgery, and by the time her wounds had healed six months later, her nose had caved in. Dr Adeogba is now free to practise again without restriction after a High Court ruling when he appealed the decision. Judges have called for his case to be reinvestigated by the GMC . 'It was like something from a horror movie,' she said. Dr Adeogba was employed at the private Birkdale Clinic in Crosby, Merseyside, until 2011. Women rushed to sign up for cosmetic surgery, attracted by half-price discounts. The MPTS panel heard how Dr Adeogba, who passed his exams in Germany in 1979, repeatedly failed to take adequate medical histories of patients, and failed to give full information on the dangers of surgery. In December MPTS panel chair Dr Malcolm Philips, said: 'Dr Adeogba's standards fell below or seriously below those to be expected of a competent cosmetic surgeon. 'The failings were wide-ranging and occured over a two-year period. 'Dr Ageogba's failings placed patients at risk of harm, some did suffer direct harm as a result of his lack of care.' But after being removed from the doctor's register by the MPTS, Dr Adegoba has since successfully overturned the decision in the High Court. He is now free to practise without restriction, pending further legal challenges. The High Court wants the MPTS to look at Dr Adeogba's case again but a date for the hearing has yet to be set. Until the second hearing he is back on the medical register with no conditions. The doctor's watchdog, the GMC, which investigates cases and brings doctors before the MPTS, is now taking the case to the Court of Appeal, to reinstate its original decision. The Birkdale Clinic, based in Park Road, went under the control of new management more than a year ago and renamed itself The New Birkdale Clinic. It has no links with its predecessor. Dr Adeogba could not be contacted for comment.","Dr Olufemi Adeyinka Adeogba was struck off in December 2013 .

"A new, unofficial report indicates that a Jewish doctor who claimed she was the victim of an antisemitic when she was thrown off of a JetBlue flight earlier this month was actually the aggressor in the mid-air dispute with a Palestinian woman who she said was a 'murderer' and that she probably had explosives in her bag. The new report, which WPBF says it did not receive from the airline, Queens Doctor Lisa Rosenberg 'accused customer 9C of being a Palestinian murderer, and that her people . were all murderers and that they murder children,' the station reported . on Wednesday.

Scroll down for video . Booted: Dr. Lisa Rosenberg was tossed off of a JetBlue flight after an intense argument with another passenger . In a phone interview with WPBF, the airline said that Rosenberg's version of events 'in no way reflects the report that we have.' In the unofficial report, a flight attendant described how Rosenberg 'went even further to suggest 9C had explosives in her bag and it would bring the aircraft down.' Rosenberg maintains that she was not the aggressor in the argument, saying in an interview with the New York Daily News that she didn't say 'anything like that.' Slurs: Dr Rosenberg claims the Palestinian woman called her a 'zionist pig' 'As far as I know, the reports are heresay,' she told The News. She then went on to say that the flight attendant used an antisemitic slur against her. The argument reportedly began when Rosenberg was overheard by the Palestinian woman praising Israel's military offensive in Gaza. The Palestinian woman then reportedly said her comments were offensive, which is when Rosenberg is said to have launched into her tirade. Report: In the JetBlue report, the airline claims Rosenberg refused to stop screaming so she needed to be removed from the aircraft . Blogger Steven Frischling posted on his website some excerpts from what he claims to be the official JetBlue incident report. According to the report, Rosenberg would not sit down or stop yelling, so the captain sent a conflict resolution officer to try and calm her down. Rosenberg continued to cause a scene and other passengers were complaining, so the crew determined she needed to be removed from the aircraft.","Dr. Lisa Rosenberg claims the woman called her a 'Zionist pig'

"He has already given himself Wolverine's claws and Magneto's gravity defying boots. Now British inventor Colin Furze has unveiled his latest attempt to give himself X-Men superpowers - with a wrist mounted flame thrower. It can produce flames up to 12 metres long. Scroll down for video . Colin Furze demonstrates the wrist mounted flame thrower . The system is mounted in a backpack, with controls on each wrist. Propane cylinders used for a blowtorch provide the gas. It is used to fill a reservoir which allows a far larger flame to be created. To operate the system, the wearer flicks their wrist to start a pilot flame, then their other wrist to light the gas. Colin Furze, a 34 year old plumber from Lincolnshire said the fire-thrower was a natural choice for this third attempt to give himself X-Men powers. 'I just had to do Pyro as I seem to have a connection with fire,' he said. 'After working with some special effects guys on a TV pilot they showed me a great way of creating a gas powered device that was safe and controllable. 'The result is a real life super hero -  well, as close as i could get.' To operate the system, the wearer flicks their wrist to start a pilot flame, then their other wrist to light the gas. The system is mounted in a backpack, with controls on each wrist. 'I like the idea of being able to shoot flames from my wrist,' said Furze. The system is mounted in a backpack, with controls on each wrist. A propane cylinders usually used for a blowtorch provides the gas. The system in action: It can shoot flames up to 12 feet . Previous projects have also been a big success for Furze. In ‘X-Men: Days of Future Past’, super-villain Magneto is shown ripping a baseball stadium from its foundation and levitating it off the ground. Inspired by this incredible power, a plumber from Lincolnshire has attempted to recreate this metal-controlling power using home-made magnetic shoes. X-men: Pyro in action in The Last Stand (X3) Colin Furze, 34, spent a week creating the strange gadget, which allow him to walk upside down along metal ceilings. Mr Furze built the magnet in the shoes . using a microwave transformer, with one of the coils removed, and . hooking it up to a car battery. He then placed the transformer on a shoe shaped plate and clamped his foot to it. He has attached straps to the shoes with switches which power the flow of electricity and enable him to walk. The father-of-one said he could potentially use his mad invention to scale skyscrapers, instead of taking the lift. ‘The shoes are great fun but it is rather bizarre trying to walk upside down, you have to really force your feet on to the ceiling,’ said Mr Furze, who lives in Stamford, Lincolnshire. ‘It’s rather nerve-racking because if the electricity fails the magnets won’t work and I will fall. An X-Men fan has invented his own magnetic shoes which help him to walk upside down.

"Target: This so-called Muslim Patrol take the alcohol from this man and filmed it for a YouTube propaganda video . Police are investigating reports a gang claiming to be Islamic vigilantes have been confronting members of the public and demanding they give up alcohol and women cover their flesh in their 'Muslim area'. The hooded men, who call themselves Muslim Patrol, have been filmed walking London's streets and calling white women 'naked animals with no self respect.' The group is also shown taking 'evil' booze from revellers and film a cyclist being treated after a road accident, claiming they were injured because they were unclean. In one exchange a member of the group says:  'We don't care if you are appalled at all', before calling themselves 'vigilantes implementing Islam upon your own necks'. They have uploaded videos to their YouTube channel with the most recent three-minute clip causing a stir online. 'The Truth About Saturday Night', which was uploaded on Sunday, has already been viewed more than 42,000 times. Scotland Yard says it is investigating. It was shot on a mobile phone at night in what the Met say is Waltham Forest, London, with a number of men seen shouting 'this is a Muslim area' towards white Britons they've confronted. The video, which first appeared on The Commentator, states: 'From women walking the street dressed like complete naked animals with no self respect, to drunk people carrying alcohol, to drunks being killed in the middle of the road, we try our best to capture and forbid it all.' One scene shows the hooded yobs forcing a passing man to put a can of lager away, telling the stunned gentleman they are the Muslim Patrol and that alcohol is a 'forbidden evil'. They then tell a group of women 'they need to forbid themselves from dressing like this and exposing themselves outside the mosque'. Scroll down for video . Message: The speaker on the film says this person was injured because of their unclean life drinking alcohol . Want: The group tell people to leave their area of London because it is Muslim in their controversial film posted on Sunday . On another occasion, a woman takes offence to their requests and tells them they are in Great Britain at which point they respond by saying 'they don't respect those who disobey God'. Mohammed Shafiq, the chief executive of the Ramadhan Foundation, a Muslim organisation which campaigns for a peaceful co-existence among communities, has condemned the group's behaviour. He said: 'We live in the UK and we are governed by UK law, there should be no mob rule. If people are involved in this behaviour then it is worrying but it is an isolated incident.' Taken: In another film they target posters they believe are immoral, ripping them down and spray-painting them . Burnt: The poster advertising a bra from H&M was then thrown on the ground and set alight . The vigilante video follows an earlier clip made by the group where they protested against adverts for push-up bras by High Street retailer H&M. In the clip they say: 'The Muslims have taken it upon themselves to command the good and forbid the evil and cover up these naked people.' They then show a number of adverts for the product which has been sprayed over and also film themselves pouring petrol over one advert and setting it on fire.","Group has released a video filmed in London called: 'The Truth About Saturday Night'

"A porn star has publicly named and shamed Philadelphia Flyers defenseman Michael Del Zotto claiming the NHL star is 'constantly pestering her to arrange dates'. Adult film actress and director Lisa Ann posted a string of embarrassing messages on Twitter suggesting the sportsman persistently asks her to organize rendezvous with other women. She calls him the 'most annoying texter in the history of my life' and notes: 'Strange, most guys want to date me, not use me to find other dates.' Porn star Lisa Ann (left) has posted a series of messages on Twitter claiming NHL player Michael Del Zotto (right) constantly pesters her to arrange dates with other women . Del Zotto, 24, was a New York Rangers first-round draft choice in 2008 and played in the city from 2009 until 2014, when the Blueshirts traded him to the Nashville Predators. But Nashville wouldn't re-sign him, and Del Zotto, known for his shaky off-ice reputation, became a free agent until Philadelphia Flyers signed him this summer on a one-year contract. Lisa Ann, 42, has been in the adult film industry for more than 20 years - while also making mainstream appearances on the the Howard Stern Show and in a music video for rapper Eminem. As well as posting the revelations about Del Zotto's questionable dating methods, the porn star also told her 750,000 followers the story of how they became acquainted. Del Zotto signed a one-year contract with the Philadelphia Flyers in August after spending time as a free agent . She wrote: '(S)hort story... It all started about 2 years ago when I was hosting an event @MichaelDelZotto reached out to the promoter to meet me.. 'I looked him up, he was with the Rangers at the time, looked cute, I thought ok, Pro Athlete, he won't try to kill or rob me, so sure I will. 'So, we go on a date, its nice, hang out- yada yada yada... about a week later he started asking if could hook him up with girls on the road.

'We reconnect and start talking and we get right back to this before we even had another date our selves.. I did warn him of this outcome.' Ann doesn't hold back in her assessment of the ice hockey star's behaviour . Ann's Twitter feed is filled with posts about Flyers defenseman Del Zotto . She later jests: 'As you may imagine, I get some pretty random texts.. Takes a lot to annoy me, but some people strive at it. 'So girls,... Do me a favor... Just to do the kid the favor and get it out of my hands @MichaelDelZotto is looking for dates, lots of them! 'Wait now..

"Headteachers are warning that schools across Britain have been targeted in an alleged Islamist plot to take over classrooms. The National Association of Head Teachers said it had ‘serious concerns’ about attempts to ‘alter the character’ of at least six schools. It also warned that efforts to infiltrate classrooms were not limited to Birmingham and were likely to be affecting other major towns and cities. Under investigation: Park View school, pictured above, is being investigated over the plot - which headteachers fear could spread . The Bradford Muslim Education Forum has run events involving alleged Birmingham plotter Tahir Alam, who heads the governing body at the city's Park View school . The union said ‘concerted efforts’ had been made to infiltrate state schools and run them according to strict Islamic principles. While the body did not name the additional areas affected, there are concerns over schools in Bradford, Manchester and parts of East London, according to the Daily Telegraph. Russell Hobby, NAHT general secretary, said some teachers were being appointed because of their Muslim faith rather than their skills. Pupils at a school affected by the alleged plot freely praise terrorism, are segregated by gender, and are taught women must obey their husbands, it has been claimed. Park View School in Birmingham allegedly failed to challenge the views of pupils who praised suicide bombers in the 9/11 and 7/7 atrocities. Staff also taught that wives are ‘not allowed’ to refuse sex with their husbands, and that women belong in the kitchen, the Association of British Humanists said. The organisation – which says it was told of the practices by former employees – also said girls were made to sit at the back of classes, and ignored when they tried to answer questions. Park View denied the allegations, and said the idea it supports terrorism is ‘abhorrent’. There was also evidence of ‘pressure’ being brought to bear on heads to adopt ‘certain philosophies and approaches’. Speaking ahead of the union’s annual conference in Birmingham, he said: ‘We ourselves have concerns about what has been going on in and around half a dozen of those schools. ‘There have been things going on inside our schools which would make some of us feel uncomfortable.’ Meanwhile, it has been claimed that dozens of teachers pushed out of schools by an alleged Islamist takeover plot are too afraid to speak out because of gagging orders. Birmingham MP Khalid Mahmood said at least ten teachers told him they were made to sign agreements offering cash in return for their silence. The latest allegation of the so-called ‘Trojan Horse’ plot – whereby Muslim extremists infiltrate state schools and run them according to Islamic principles – was made last night as Ofsted announced inspections at a further three schools, bringing the total to 21. Birmingham City Council is also investigating 25 schools. Mr Mahmood said: ‘A lot of people are still not speaking, even in private, because they are frightened of what may happen. They think if they come forward they will lose their pay-off or pensions and are worried they will then not be able to teach.’ Inquiry: Earlier this month, the names of 18 schools at the centre of the alleged plot were revealed in a list by Birmingham City Council. Above, one of the schools, Gracelands Nursery School in Sparkbrook . Under investigation: The allegations came to light earlier this year. Above, Adderley Primary School in Saltley . Lindsey Clark, former head of Park View, resigned this month after being reduced to a 'figurehead' with no real control over her school, a Department for Education probe found . Noshaba Hussain, a moderate Muslim former headmistress of Springfield Primary, was forced out of her job by a ‘well-organised and sinister’ group of extremists more than 20 years ago. The 69-year-old told the Mail she was made to sign a confidentiality agreement, or ‘gag’, that threatened to withdraw her pay-off of a few months’ salary if she spoke to the press. She claimed false rumours were spread about her by the Muslim governing body until she was sacked by Birmingham education chiefs for what was described as a ‘loss of faith and trust in the head by the governing body’. ‘It was all done through my union,’ she said. ‘I was told if I spoke to the press about what happened to me I would have to return the money.’ A source from one of the schools affected said: ‘A lot of teachers who leave are being bullied and harassed. The threat of taking away a reference can be worse than a monetary threat as they are worried their career will be affected.’","National Association of Head Teachers has voiced 'serious concerns'

"Dr Death: Teenage gym instructor Travis Barber was found dead after a violent reaction to the deadly ecstasy-type tablet . A 19-year-old gym instructor who died after taking an overdose of a super-strength Ecstasy drug known as ‘Dr Death’ was so badly injured that police thought he had been murdered. Travis Barber suffered a violent reaction to the Class A drug and trashed the house he shared with his mother, ripping down curtains and tipping over tables before collapsing. Dr Louise Barber found her son’s body in the dining room when she returned home to Salford after a weekend away. Travis was lying on his back with his fists and teeth clenched. Yesterday, Dr Barber, 42, pleaded with young people not to play ‘Russian roulette’ with their lives by taking the drug. A post-mortem found Travis had 62 separate injuries. It concluded he died of a massive overdose of Paramethoxyamphetamine, known as PMA. The concentration in his blood was the largest ever recorded, six times the fatal level. After an inquest into her son’s death, Dr Barber said: ‘I would say [to young people] just don’t do it and please avoid all drugs, it’s like playing Russian roulette with your life, you just don’t know what is in the drugs. You think when you are young it will never happen to you, but it does. ‘Travis was kind, considerate and just a lovely, beautiful lad in every way. He loved his personal training and keeping fit. Travis loved music and playing the guitar and he was a wonderful son who was very much loved by his family, who are all  devastated by his death.’ PMA is similar to Ecstasy and often comes in pink, heart-shaped tablets. Police issued a warning to youngsters to be careful after it claimed the lives of five people in January alone. The hearing was told that Travis, who was described as ‘very healthy and happy’, trained as a lifeguard before accepting a job as a fitness trainer at a gym in Stockport. But he started taking steroids to bulk up his muscles and confessed to his mother and girlfriend he had been experimenting with other drugs.

His girlfriend, Hayley Chaddock, told . the inquest in Bolton: ‘We had a conversation one night about the . different drugs he had tried. He took out a plastic bag with some . tablets in. He didn’t take any when he was with me. ‘I wasn’t telling him off but I didn’t . agree. I think he just thought he was alright and he was safe to take . them. Obviously, no one is safe.’ Dr Barber said: ‘He told me he had . tried it on three occasions. He didn’t say he was taking it regularly, . just that he had experimented. We talked about the things that he had . tried. I asked him to promise me that he would not take Ecstasy again. He did say he wouldn’t.’ Lethal dose: The deadly drug PMA responsible for the tragic death of teenage gym instructor Travis Barber . But he failed to heed his mother’s . advice. A work colleague told the hearing that Travis took a tablet on . Friday, February 15, after finishing his shift. Dr Barber found his body . two days later, when she returned home from a weekend in London. She found drug paraphernalia under his . bed, including cannabis, cigarette papers, Tamoxifen tablets and . needles. Pills and powder were found in the boot of his car. Julie Evans, a consultant forensic . toxicologist, said Travis may have accidentally overdosed on PMA because . it is much slower to take effect than normal Ecstasy – but it is around . five times as strong. Tragic: Kimberley Bradbury (left) and Rachel Woodiwiss are just two of the victims who have died this year after taking the lethal PMA drug . She said: ‘If you are used to Ecstasy, you could just take an extra tablet or two thinking that the pill is low-strength.’ Recording a narrative verdict, Alan . Walsh, deputy coroner of Bolton, said Travis’ death exposed a ‘grave . tragedy and grave problem with the drug industry.’ ‘Travis got himself into this . situation by experimenting with this drug,’ he added. ‘He was a healthy . young man with a large number of friends who was respected by his peers . and clients. I see a young man with great potential. Any drug is . unlawful and any drug that is unlawful should not be used.’ PMA, nicknamed Dr Death for its lethal side-effects, has claimed the lives of ten young people within a 60-mile radius of Manchester since January. The pills, which are available for as little as £3 each, are sometimes pink and shaped like Love Hearts sweets, or stamped with an ‘M’. The amphetamine is also known as pink ecstasy, but it contains a different active ingredient which makes it as much as five times stronger. PMA also takes longer to have an effect than ecstasy which means some users take more and unwittingly give themselves fatal overdoses. The youngest victim was  16-year-old Ellie Jones, who died after suffering breathing difficulties at a friend’s house in Warrington. PMA has also been linked  to the deaths of eight revellers in Canada and there have been other deaths in Norway and Denmark.","Promising teenager tragically found dead in the family home by his doctor mother .

His administration in being besieged by problems overt the implementation of his signature Affordable Care Act.

In addition, millions have Americans have had their health insurance policies withdrawn because they do not comply with the Act. That contradicts Obama's earlier oft repeated claim that 'If you like you health insurance, you can keep it'. The President apologised for the problems, saying: 'We fumbled the rollout on this health care law'.But he insisted that the butt-of-jokes website has 'gotten a lot better over the last few weeks' despite problems with 'information technology procurement' that are inherent in the federal government.Adding to the blow, the latest poll broke the results down into gender and age demographics, showing that every such group disapproves of the work the President is doing.

"An Indian flight was delayed by more than 90 minutes after an argument broke out between an irate passenger and the plane’s crew. The Indigo flight from Delhi to Chennai was delayed when a businessman, angry at being forced to wait in an airport coach for 35 minutes, started remonstrating with cabin crew. The pilot reportedly gave a message over the speaker in the plane, saying he would not take off until the passenger had apologised for his behaviour. The spat is said to have occurred following a delay in boarding the aircraft on Sunday. Passengers claim they were forced to wait for 35 minutes in three airport coaches parked on the tarmac as they were transferred from the terminal to the runway. When boarding finally began, the businessman started arguing with the cabin staff over the delay. An announcement was then broadcast declaring that the aircraft would leave for Chennai only after the businessman, who asked not to be named, apologised. ‘The captain had the cheek to threaten the passenger that he would be offloaded if he didn't apologise,’ fellow passenger Alok Kumar told the Mumbai Mirror. IndiGo's scheduled flight from Delhi to Chennai on Sunday was delayed by more than 90 minutes after an argument broke out between an irate passenger and the plane’s pilot . Passengers had already filled the three coaches that were ferrying them to flight 6E 287, scheduled to leave Delhi at 8.45 pm. They were asked to remain in the coaches until the aircraft, which had come in from Ahmedabad, was prepared for take-off. Just over 30 minutes later, they were asked to board the flight, which is when the businessman from Mumbai complained about the delay. ‘The first cabin announcement the captain made should have been about the reason for keeping passengers waiting in the coaches for so long and he should have apologised for the delay,’ said Amit Mohan, who recorded the altercation on his phone camera. Mr Mohan, the director of a multinational medical equipment manufacturing company, instead claimed the captain immediately sought an apology from the passenger. Passengers claim they were forced to wait for 35 minutes in three airport coaches parked on the tarmac as they were transferred from the terminal to the runway . When the man refused, IndiGo security staff were summoned before proceeding to haul the passenger off the aircraft, upon which several others stepped in to help the businessman and security staff then backed off. It was just over an hour later that the flight finally took off for Chennai. The airline confirmed that the flight had been delayed, but claimed it had been unavoidable as crew were helping a wheelchair-bound woman disembark from the previous flight from Ahmedabad. ‘It was a one-off case, where a senior citizen with special requirements was seated in row five,’ an IndiGo spokesman said in a statement to the Mumbai Mirror. He explained that due to the passenger's multiple fractures she could not easily be moved without causing pain so helping her off the flight took longer than expected. The airline claimed the angry passenger 'abused' ‘the captain as he stepped out from the cockpit and said staff were forced to call security to intervene.","Flight from Delhi to Channai delayed by 90 minutes following the row .

"John Wayne Bobbitt - the American man who became a household name when his ex-wife used a carving knife to slice off his penis - has broken his neck in a car accident, it has been claimed. Mr Bobbitt is understood to have been driving to his brother's house in Buffalo, New York on Tuesday when a driver jumped a red light and plowed into the 47-year-old's pick-up truck. The former U.S. Marine achieved worldwide notoriety in 1993 when his then wife Lorena used an eight inch carving knife to cut off his penis as punishment for what she said were repeated beatings. Scroll down for video . Injured: John Wayne Bobbitt, who famously had his penis sliced off by his wife in 1993, is pictured in hospital after he suffered a broken neck when a driver jumped a red light and plowed into his pick-up truck . Past:  Bobbitt (right in court) achieved worldwide notoriety when his then wife Lorena (left) used an eight inch carving knife to cut off his penis as punishment for what she said were repeated beatings . Although Mr Bobbitt suffered a broken vertebrae and slipped disc in his back during the crash, his injuries are not thought to be life threatening and he is expected to make a full recovery, TMZ said. Mr Bobbitt found fame in 1993 when his abusive relationship with wife Lorena made international headlines after she used a large knife to cut off his penis. He claims to been out drinking with friends in Virginia on the night of June 23, 1993, which led to the couple having a furious row when he got home. A court later heard that she claimed he tried to rape her, but Mr Bobbitt was acquitted of this. Crash: The other driver smashed into his jeep, pictured, as he drove to his brother's home in Buffalo . After he fell asleep, Lorena went out to the kitchen and chose her weapon - an eight-inch knife. She then returned to the bedroom and sliced off his penis. In a rage, she jumped in the car and drove off, throwing the severed end out of the window. The former US Marine recalls seeing torrents of blood gush from his groin before losing consciousness. He next woke momentarily in hospital, about to enter surgery. Fortunately, realising her error, Lorena had called the emergency services and a painstaking search had found his penis in a field. Doctors James T. Sehn and David Berman worked for 10 hours re-joining his detached penis - carefully stitching together nerve endings to give him the best possible chance of regaining feeling. Although he was initially told he would never be able to have sex again, Mr Bobbitt claims to have subsequently slept with more than 70 women - and has even starred in pornographic movies. Fresh start: Although he was initially told he would never be able to have sex again, Mr Bobbitt (centre) claims to have subsequently slept with more than 70 women - and has even starred in pornographic movies . Attack: Dr. James T. Sehn, one of the surgeons who reattached the penis, holds a blurred photo of it in court . Last year it was revealed he had become a devout Christian, had put his past wild behaviour behind him and now planned to settle down with his third wife. While he would not wish his horrific ordeal - which still gives him nightmares 20 years after it happened - upon anybody, Mr Bobbitt last year said he cannot deny it has transformed his life. Speaking to The Sun, he said: 'The doctors told me I would never be able to have sex again because my injuries were so bad. But I've proved them wrong time and time again. I believe I've slept with 70 women since the incident.' He added: 'Being the most famous man to have his penis chopped off does have its advantages. It definitely has not hurt my love life - in fact it improved it.'","Former U.S. Marine broke his neck in car crash in Buffalo, New York .

"Outraged: Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he deplored gender segregation . A woman who took to Facebook to vent her disgust after being shoved to the back of a bus in Israel, despite segregation being outlawed more than a year ago, has sparked outrage across the country. Tanya Rosenblit, 28, from the southern town of Ashdod, boarded a bus to an Orthodox neighborhood in Jerusalem. Shortly after . she sat down behind the driver, a man wearing the black garb and flowing . sidelocks of the ultra-Orthodox boarded the bus and asked her to move. Since Ms Rosenblit spoke of her treatment she has become a cause celebre in the Israeli media over the weekend. The case even drew public comment from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and chief rabbis, who said they deplored gender segregation. Ultra-Orthodox Jews, who make up about 10 per cent of Israel's population of 7.6 million, have become increasingly aggressive in their efforts to impose their norms in public spaces. The ultra-Orthodox have segregated bus lines and some walkways in their neighbourhoods. When Ms Rosenblit refused to move, the man then blocked the bus from driving, she told reporters. Segregation: The practice of splitting men and women up on Israeli buses was outlawed last year but one woman's story has shown some ultra-orthodox Jewish men are still submitted to the practice . She . held her ground - even after a male police officer dispatched to the . scene asked her if she was 'willing to respect them and move to the back.' She said: 'I said, ""I respected them enough with my modest dress and I don't plan to humiliate myself to respect them or anyone else."" The man opted to stay in Ashdod rather than travel on the bus with her. In Jerusalem, billboards depicting women have become a rarity because ultra-Orthodox vandals rip them down. The issue also has seeped into the military, where religious soldiers walked out of a military event several months ago because women were singing - which extremely devout Jews believe is contrary to Jewish law. In the past, ultra-Orthodox Jews have confined their strict practices to their own neighbourhoods, alongside occasional attempts to pass restrictive legislation banning sale of pork or opening shops on the Jewish Sabbath. Political storm: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu addressed the issue yesterday saying it was 'unacceptable' Recently the extremist Jews have been trying to impose their norms outside their own enclaves, but the effects are scattered. Most of Israel's secular majority is not directly affected. The Supreme Court was forced to wade into the controversy last year, when it ruled on the segregated buses and sidewalks. Although activists say harassment on buses has diminished since the court ruling late last year, some of the fiercely devout are persisting with their efforts to block the mixing of the sexes in public. Netanyahu spoke out against the attempted segregation at the start of the weekly Cabinet meeting. 'Today I heard about moving a woman on a bus. I adamantly oppose this,' Netanyahu said. 'Fringe groups must not be allowed to tear apart our common denominator. We must preserve public space as open and safe for all citizens of Israel.' Israel's two chief rabbis, themselves ultra-Orthodox Jews, concurred that the religious have no right to impose their opinions on others and proposed private bus lines as a substitute. 'It's not an ultra-Orthodox state,' said Chief Rabbi Yona Metzger, who represents Israel's Ashkenazi, or European-descended Jews. 'A person can subject himself to a stricter code, but not others,' the Ynet news website quoted Chief Rabbi Shlomo Amar, who represents Sephardic Jews of Mideast descent, as saying.","Tanya Rosenblit took to Facebook to complain about her experience which was fast reported on by the Israeli media .

"The world's fastest sailboat will attempt to achieve one of the greatest feats in the sport by breaking the Transpacific speed record crossing. The state-of-the-art vessel Hydroptere has been dubbed 'the flying boat' as it combines leading technology from both the aeronautic and marine industries. French yachtsman Alain Thébault, who designed the experimental boat, is leading the record-breaking attempt from Los Angeles to Honolulu. Scroll down for video . Hydroptere, dubbed 'the flying boat', will aim to break the Transpacific speed record crossing . The state-of-the-art vessel combines leading technology from both the aeronautic and marine industries . How fast: The fastest sailboat in the world, it can reach speeds of over 95km per hour . The record is currently held by another French team who completed the 2,215-mile journey in five days and nine hours in July 1997. The vessel and the rest of the team, architect Jean Nouvel, and teammates Jean Le Cam and Yves Palier, are currently in California preparing to launch the attempt. They will set off at the end of May but have not set a date because it will depend on the perfect weather conditions. The Hydroptere is able to achieve world-record speeds through its drag-minimising design. The boat rises above the sea surface to eliminate resistance using its 'marine wings', which are under each of the floats of the trimaran. Its name is even taken from the Greek for water and wing. Once the boat reaches ten knots, the underwater wings, generate an upward thrust to raise the boat like the wing of a plane. The pioneering sailing team of (from left to right) Yves Parler, Alain Thébault and Jean Le Cam . The foils of the vessel withstand twice as much pressure as the wings of a jet fighter . The boat, pictured in front of San Francisco, already holds the outright sailboat speed world record . The hull and the floats then fly five metres above the sea surface and just 2.5 square metres of the boat is in contact with the water. In feat of engineering, the ship's foils manage to withstand a huge amount of pressure, which is estimated to be twice as much pressure as the wings of a jet fighter. The boat can accelerate from 20 to 45 knots in just ten seconds. Hydroptere broke the outright sailboat speed world record in 2009 when it sustained a speed of 52.86 knots for 500metres in just 30 knots of wind. The same year she broke the 50 knot barrier for a nautical mile in France. Development on the extraordinary trimaran began more than 20 years ago and is made from carbon fibre and titanium. Hydroptere, pictured under the Golden Gate Bridge, accelerates from 20 to 45 knots in just ten seconds . When Hydroptere is in flight just two square metres of the vessel is in contact with the water. It can reach a maximum speed of 56 knots and accelerate from 20 to 40 knots in just ten seconds. The acceleration is faster than a 2 X 250 HP speedboat. The vessel requires 12 knots to take off but can then travel at twice the wind speed. It will launch a bid to break the Transpacific record at the beginning of June. Mr Thébault said the team that has been put together is exceptional. He said: 'Jean and Yves participated in the first flights of Hydroptere in the 90s. We made the first trials together and experienced unforgettable moments. 'Jacques Vincent joined me in 2005 and we crossed the 50 knot speed barrier together. He is an impressive helmsman.' Mr Palier said they will be in period of 'stand-by' until June as they wait for the best weather. He said: 'In June the position of the Pacific anticyclone is ideal because it provides the most direct route to Hawaii. 'The thermal wind is active in this season and we will quickly leave the California coast. 'Then we will surf the long Pacific swell downwind and we will probably have to make a gibe close the Hawaiian Islands.' The sailors have their sights set of further records and want to break the average sailing speed barrier of 80 knots. In . the trimaran, the team also want to cross the Atlantic in three days . and cross the barrier of one thousand nautical miles in 24 hours. Mr Thébault said:'We have considerable . experience in the field of foils and high speed. With these three . challenges, we have an ambitious program in the short, medium and long . term. 'Technology, human adventure and pioneering spirit will always be the core of the project.'","Hydroptere will try to break the Transpacific record when it sets sail in June .

"A young woman screams uncontrollably as a priest recites a passage from the bible in a final attempt to exorcise the devil which has possessed her for 15 years. It sounds like something from a horror movie, but this sinister scene is from a new real life documentary that highlights the extraordinary work of one of Europe’s only Vatican-approved 'exorcists'. Produced by Norwegian filmmaker Fredrik Horn Akselsen, the film entitled The Exorcist in the 21st Century follows Father José Antonio Fortea on his one man crusade to rid the world of demons. Devil woman: Constanza, who claims to have been possessed by the devil screams as one of Europe's only Vatican-approved priests tries to 'free' her . The movie is released this month and the new trailer begins with the eerie sound of monks chanting as an anonymous, hooded figure wearing a long black robe mysteriously paces across the camera. The mysterious man is Father Fortea who meets Constanza, a Colombian woman who claims to have been possessed by demons since 1997. She says the Spanish exorcist is her last hope for 'spiritual liberation'. Adding: ‘I know that Father Fortea is a very wise person who knows demonology and exorcism. 'I know that through Father Fortea I can be liberated completely.’ Ghostly: Dressed in a black hooded robe Father Fortea is on a one man mission to exorcise the devil wherever it appears in the world . Possessed: As Father Fortea tries to exorcise the devil from Constanza she shouts: 'Get away from me, you damned priest' José Antonio Fortea is a Spanish priest who specialises in performing exorcisms. Father Fortea is also an expert on demonology - the study of satanic forces - having written a number of studies and novels on the topic. While any Catholic priest or even layman can perform an exorcism, certain priests are specially trained in the art. Although exorcisms may seem old-fashioned, in fact they became much more popular during the 20th century. The success of horror films such as 1973 hit The Exorcist is thought to have fuelled the demonic boom. In disturbing scenes the woman is shown screaming: ‘Get away from me you damned Priest’ as the clergyman tries to exorcise the apparent demon within. Father Fortea says: ‘Exorcism is a fight between all the forces of light against all the forces of demons. ‘The demon inside the person can call more demons to go there to help him. ‘And at the same time the minister of exorcism can call the saints, call the angels. ‘There is a battle with the weapons of prayer. ‘There are a small number of exorcists, there are a small number of miracles. We are the proof that the kingdom of heaven has arrived.' The trailer has already attracted huge interest on the internet, but some are casting doubt on the authenticity of the film. Posting . the video on online sharing site Digg, Meredith Woerner writes: ‘Is . this the real deal? You be the judge — either way the fervor on display . here is pretty chilling.’ The film is director Akselsen's second documentary. His debut film Treason and Sabotage premiered on Kosmorama International Film Festival in March 2010. In addition to this, Akselsen is writing and directing three other projects, currently in development. Demon slayer: Father Fortea says: 'There are a small number of exorcists, there are a small number of miracles. We are the proof that the kingdom of heaven has arrived.' Healing powers?

"Fox is gambling large on its upcoming reality series 'Utopia,' investing millions of dollars in the show that challenges 15 participants to create their own mini societies on a secluded piece of land. 'Utopia' is what the network calls its 'boldest' and 'most groundbreaking social experiment.' It will put 15 people from all walks of life in a secluded plot of land in California, where they will build  their ideal civilization for one year — starting with no heat, no electricity and no plumbing. The set includes a self-filtering lake and a barn, which will provide the participants with two dairy cows and twelve chickens. The 15 'Utopians' start with no more than $10,000 and have to decide how to use it to develop their new economy and develop more of the land. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Fifteen participants will remain in isolation for a year while they build a new civilization for Fox's new reality behemoth, 'Utopia' Aside from a barn with a couple of cows and some chickens, participants have to build new structures and find their own food . The show will air on Tuesday and some Fridays, and is expected to be Fox's big programming bet this fall . The roster includes a bellydancer, an ex-con, a veterinarian technician and a pregnant woman due in December. 'This is the most pure form of reality that I have ever produced in my career,' boasts executive producer John de Mol, the man behind 'Big Brother.' 'Utopia,' which debuts on Sept. 7 with a three-night premiere, comes with 200 crew members, hundreds of cameras and round-the-clock video streaming. Fox has scheduled the show for Tuesdays and some Fridays, counting on it to replace 'X Factor' and 'American Idol.' The network will also stream the show online 24/7. The 15 participants on 'Utopia' come from all walks of life, from a belly dancer to a veterinarian technician, a chili farmer and a pregnant woman . But so far, the series has seen plenty of snags. Insiders say the network stands to spend $50 million on just 20 episodes — and is also struggling internally with a group of new producers involved in the show, TheWrap reported. 'The bill has arrived and it is on the very high end of staggering,' one network executive told the news outlet. Executive producer Conrad Green told Variety the cost for the set was 'not insignificant,' though he wouldn't give any more details. And this is a time of internal changes at Fox. The man behind the project, ex-chairman Kevin Reilly, moved on in June — leaving a group of incoming executives to inherit the schedule he created, Variety reported. It is also the first big project for Simon Andreae, in charge of alternative, who joined the network in October. The dutch version of the show premiered in January and has thus far been a success, industry insiders say.","Network is said to be investing $50 million to produce the show .

"Full time: Chris Jarvis said he was expected to work from 9.30am-6pm . When you sign up to do a spot of work shadowing to 'gain an insight into the business', you don't expect to be working for nine hours a day doing the work of a full-time - and fully-paid - employee. So Chris Jarvis took legal action against entertainment and electronics giant Sony when it refused to pay him for four months' work. And the company has paid the its 'unpaid intern' £4,600 after the video games design graduate took his case to HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC). Mr Jarvis, a video games design graduate from Milton Keynes, signed up to do an internship at Sony Computer Entertainment in Cambridge last September. He signed up for the role of '3D Environment Artist intern'  and expected that he would be shadowing a Sony designer to learn about the company. But he found himself in the office from 9.30am to 6pm every day, testing 3D artwork for games. 'I was basically clicking buttons to make sure the pictures that had come in from China were working,' Mr Jarvis said. 'It's normally part of the Environment Artist's job - but it's time-consuming and boring work. The 25-year-old, who has a first class degree in Games Art and Design from Norwich University, 'politely informed' the . company that they owed him at least minimum wage of £6.19, considering . he was effectively working as a full-time employee. 'They were very dismissive and told me I was a volunteer and that's how I could work for free,' he said. Mr Jarvis said he was also making a daily round-trip commute of three-and-a-half hours to Sony's City . House base in Cambridge, a journey which the company agreed to cover in travel expenses. But he said that after the first month's payment, the travel expenses dried up. 'I was at the end of my overdraft and I didn't know what to do' said Mr Jarvis, who is now a lead graphic designer at Air Raid Clothing in Milton Keynes. 'So I looked into my rights and found that I was legally doing the work of an employee.' Unpaid: Mr Jarvis, then a recent graduate, expected his internship to involve a few months' shadowing a Sony designer . The case went to a tribunal, and the . $20billion company coughed up weeks before it was due to be heard. Sony ended up paying Mr Jarvis around £1,000 more than he originally asked for. The company also asked him to sign an agreement to keep quiet about the deal, which Mr Jarvis declined. Jasmine Patel of solicitors Leigh Day, who dealt with Mr Jarvis's case, said: 'In Chris’s case, it was very clear. We . looked at the fact that he had set hours, that he was expected to do the . work he was given and that he was required to do that work personally. She added that employees needed to have a better understanding of workers' rights. 'The only people who will be able to afford to do these internships are the ones who can pay to do them, while the people from poorer backgrounds can’t,' she said. 'On a legal level, under the National Minimum Wage Act 1998, interns who meet the definition of a “worker” are entitled to be paid at least the national minimum wage. 'A key question when determining whether someone is a worker is whether the intern is obliged to perform work or services for the company and whether the organisation is obliged to provide it – i.e. a mutually of obligations. 'If the intern is doing work which is of value to the company this may also be a good indication that the intern is actually a worker and should be paid. Work experience: Mr Jarvis undertook the internship at Sony Computer Entertainment in Cambridge from September till December 2012 . 'These cases are very case specific . but where there is a mutuality of obligations, someone is really . providing value to the company and the internship is for quite a long . period - say six months - there will probably be a higher chance that . they will be a worker and therefore should be being paid. 'You could argue that someone who . comes in every single day and makes the tea should eventually be paid . for that service if they’re proving to be of value for the company, but . these cases will in the end be decided on a case by case basis.' According to Government regulations, . employers do not have to pay the minimum wage if an internship only . involves observing an employee and no work is carried out by the intern. Charities, voluntary organisations associated bodies and statutory bodies do not have to pay volunteers, but other businesses are not allowed to refuse to pay a worker by claiming they are a volunteer. About 100,000 young people are thought . to be working for no pay and 100 companies are being investigated by . HMRC for allegedly breaching minimum wage laws. Sony declined to comment.","Chris Jarvis, 25, signed up for work experience at Sony in Cambridge in 2012 .

"Letters show how 'shaky' Hitler's hold on power was at times and how . unpopular the Second World War became among the German masses . Letters written by ordinary Germans to Adolf Hitler during the dark days of Nazi Germany have been discovered in a Russian archive. The fascinating correspondence, which will surprise many with their critical tone, begins in 1924 and goes right through to the Fuhrer’s last days as he cowered in a Berlin bunker in 1945. The documents, which were found in a Russian archive, have now been translated into English and reveal a side of the Nazis that is rarely considered. Support: Gustav Jaindl of Vienna wrote this letter to Hitler thanking him for the integration of Austria into the greater German Reich.  His letter is among those recently found in a Russian archive and which are now published in a new book . Fan mail: A decorative telegram to Hitler declaring 'loyalty and love' sent in 1937 from a Dr Otto Hellmuth . Tribute: Erwin Walther composed the 'Heil Hitler, Heil' march for his beloved Fuhrer . They show how the popularity of Hitler's National Socialists party was carefully managed as support grew among the German population - and beyond. But, more surprisingly, the letters . also show how 'shaky' Hitler’s hold on power was at times and how . unpopular the Second World War became among the masses. His office even received, and replied to, letters from Jews complaining about his party's increasingly anti-Semitic stance. Chillingly, the British editor of a . book publishing the correspondence, Letter To Hitler, claims the . collection shows how a similarly totalitarian regime could emerge today. Dr Victoria Harris said: 'Some letters from people who idolise . him are totally fawning, but you get the impression from the others . that he could easily lose his approval. 'The biggest lesson I learned was how shaky his popularity was and how the regime had to work hard to maintain popularity. 'What is chilling is that you can see how he built his support and how you could see it happening elsewhere.' Lotte Kaiser wrote this Mothers' Day card for Hitler. 'Unutterably great thanks to Adolf's parents for giving birth to Our Fuhrer', she gushed . Young admirers: Susi and Daisy from the Sudetenland thank Hitler for having 'freed us and brought us into your beautiful Reich' Document: An eulogy from the Basalt works of Radebeule in praise of the Fuhrer . The Nazis carefully filed all the letters that their leader received, copied the replies and filed those as well. The letters grew in number through . the 1930s as the Nazi party became more powerful, and include thousands . wishing Hitler a happy birthday. The correspondence includes letters . from Jews unhappy with his policies, and from others pointing out to . Hitler what he ought to be doing. From Mrs von Ponief in 1930 . As early as 1925 the direction of the National Socialist party was being questioned, especially its lack of religious revival. Hitler’s deputy Rudolf Hess responded . to one such enquiry by stating that religious revival was not among the . goals of the Nazi Party. Hess replied to another correspondent in 1925 who asked whether Hitler drank. The reply was: 'Mr Hitler does not . drink alcohol, except perhaps a few drops on very exceptional occasions. He does not smoke at all.' Support for anti-Semitic policies was received from a Mrs von Ponief in 1930. She wrote: 'In order to do completely . Jew-free work, we must require our members to agree not to buy from . Jews, in this way we can gradually succeed in driving Jews out of . retailing and thus put the middle-class back in the saddle.' International appeal: A bizarre book from the Austrians of Argentina declaring their approval of Hitler . Frankfurt mayor Freidrich Krebs sent his best to Hitler for the New Year in the form of a medieval manuscript . Awed: Lottie H wrote a poem to Hitler worrying that he worked too hard . The letters also show how well . Hitler’s book Mein Kampf was doing, and in 1932 his publisher wrote to . him: 'Between the beginning of this year and 21 May we have been able to . sell a total of 29,385 copies of your work. Therefore we are crediting . you with a payment of 21,157.20 marks...' Another writer wanted permission to market 'Hitler Cigarettes', but the offer was declined. One letter from a Jew showed how integrated into German society they were and how the discrimination surprised them. Heinrich Herz wrote: 'But what I . cannot say I am satisfied with is the one-sided treatment of thousands . of my co-religionists, whose feeling and thinking are just as German as . mine. 'How much I should like to help build up my beloved Fatherland, if only an opportunity to do so were offered me.' In 1934, as Hitler built up a head of . steam, the fawning letters grew in number and included this from . Stanislaus Jaros, who wrote: 'I am prepared, like my father, even to . sacrifice my life, when Germany is involved and you, my Leader, call.' As war approached, correspondents . kept asking for peace. In 1938, Josef and Elli Jablonski wrote: 'It . makes us happy and glad to know that peace exists and will remain.' Treasure trove: The box in the Russian archives that contained the Hitler correspondence . The correspondence has been gathered in new book Letters To Hitler . As the Second World War headed to its . conclusion many wrote to Hitler with ideas for new weapons, but the . letters asking for autographs and showing declarations of support fell . to zero. But some remained faithful unto the . end, like Justizrat W von Zezschwitz, who wrote: 'But it may be granted . to your prudent, temporising leadership, as we all confidently hope it . will, at the right moment, with fullest health, to put a compelling halt . to the enemy who has penetrated so far into German lands in the East . and the West.' Dr Harrissaid: 'Through . the 1930s the letters grow in number and Hitler received many before . the elections in 1933. And he got thousands on his birthday. 'The high point was in 1938 and then the numbers of letters dropped off quite suddenly when the war started in 1939. 'In the 1930s, the letters show veneration and excitement but also strongly-worded criticism. 'People wrote to complain about . specific aspects of his policies. In 1934, he received a letter from a . Jew who was not practising, but still had the confidence to write. 'Surprisingly those who complained . often received feedback and it is clear that the regime realised the . importance of popularity. 'Hitler said that popularity was the . most important aspect of authority and by replying to the letters the . regime was giving the illusion of paying attention. 'And the longer the war went on the more they needed to enhance their popularity. 'It is also clear what a strategic . error it was to start the war because the people saw Hitler as someone . to bring peace and they didn’t want to go to war. 'And they did feel able to write to . Hitler about it and the letters were carefully filed away and copies of . replies that were sent were filed alongside the letters. 'There is even one objecting to a relative being sent to Auschwitz.'","Correspondence includes adulatory and critical letters from 1924 to 1945 .

"IKEA is likely the world’s largest single consumer of wood.The Swedish conglomerate needs about 1% of the world’s wood supply to make the furniture sold in its roughly 300 global stores, according to Pacific Standard.The company needs so much wood, in fact, that Swedwood, a subsidiary company, handles production of all wood-based furniture. Outraged as many may be, critics and their eco-conscience friends might pause before deciding to chain themselves to a forest of Scandinavian trees, the company has a sustainability plan for all this wood. Mountains: These are mountains of wood chips outside IKEA's particle board factory in southern Sweden . Almost a quarter, 23%, of all wood used by the discount furniture peddler meets Forest Stewardship Council standards, according to last year’s IKEA Sustainability Report. The goal is to have half of all wood used meeting those standards by 2017, the report further explained. Additionally, the report says IKEA does not accept wood that has been illegally logged and further supports an additional 13 projects run by the World Wildlife Federation, ‘so that more wood can come from certified forests.’Anyone who’s bought IKEA furniture knows the ‘wood’ is actually particle board. That particle board all comes from one place, Hultsfred – a factory in southern Sweden dedicated making the hardwood alternative. Cavernous: IKEA needs giant construction equipment to navigate around and transport saw dust out of the giant piles surrounding its massive particle board factory . Busy: This Swedwood factory in Northern Poland, the IKEA subsidiary's biggest, churns out 30,000 pieces of furniture a year . Hultsfred, according to National Geographic, plows through 150,000 loose cubic yards of pine saw dust every single day. This in addition to the spruce trees thrown into massive wood chippers, that combine with the saw dust and a vile glue-like mixture containing synthetic urea to make the particle board.The factory churns out so much of the stuff that a giant dryer capable of holding 45 tons of the saw dust-wood chip mixture refills every hour before sucking all the moisture out of the former trees at a temperature of 840 degrees Fahrenheit, National Geographic reported. Massive: This giant dryer tumbles 45 tons of saw dust and wood chips at 840 degrees Fahrenheit each hour, note the giant piles of wood chips and saw dust surrounding it . Gigantic: These huge dryers each hold 90 particle boards and slowly turn them until fully dried before they head out to one of 12 different suppliers across Europe . After combining the wood with the revolting glue, urea is found in urine, the processed particle boards are loaded onto giant rotating drying racks that can hold 90 of the massive boards, reported National Geographic. Famous: Ingvar Kamprad, founder of IKEA, is well-known in Sweden for making the company a global household name . It takes over 16,000 people across 50 different Swedwood sites in 10 countries to make the 100 million pieces of furniture sold each year by its parent company, according to the subsidiary. Swedwood has grown between 20-25% per year since it’s founding in 1991, and it plans to keep growing. That’s a lot of trees but, one question still hasn't been answered, which does IKEA go through more of each year – meatballs or trees?","The wood is needed to make the roughly 100 million pieces of furniture sold each year by the Swedish company .

"California pastor Danny Goia and wife Daniela claim they've received a sign from god in the ghostly image of a veiled woman hovering in the background of a photograph. 'I can clearly see the face,' Daniela said. 'I can even see the long hair. I can see, like a veil that covers all the way to the floor.' The couple, who preside over First Romanian Pentecostal Church in Anaheim, said the photograph came to them through a member named Radu. Signs: Could this picture of a factory worker have captured the image of an emissary from God? Sign from above: A California pastor believes this photo captures and angel and is a 'sign from God' Man of faith: Pastor Danny Goia said the picture was shown to him by a newly baptized member of his church . Radu declined to appear in person for television news crews, but explained that he had taken a picture of a co-worker at an Irvine warehouse two weeks ago and saw the figure floating over the man's shoulder. Radu claimed not to have altered the image in any way. Radu and his wife were recently baptized at the church and married later that day. Fact or fiction? The photo was taken at a warehouse as a man was trying to take a picture of his co-worker . 'The next day was when this photo was taken,' Daniela told CBS 2. 'God is trying to reveal to the people before something major will happen,' Danny Goia added. Preacher: Goia has shown the image to his flock and warned them to right themselves with God . The pair believe that the image is both a message from God and an angel watching over their new member. Danny Goia presented the image to his flock on Thursday during church service, admonishing them to prepare for big events. 'God wants to say, 'Hey, get ready. Get well with me because something good is gonna come soon,' he said. .","Pastor and wife believe image means God has something big planned .

"WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT . These pictures show frightened girls lined up before villagers in Kenya to be circumcised - even though the brutal practice is now illegal in the country. But in many African tribes, traditions are more important than laws and circumcision is considered a rite of passage that marks their transition into womanhood so they can marry. Reuters photographer Siegfried Modola captured this ceremony in rural Kenya for four teenage girls of the Pokot tribe, in Baringo County. Draped in animal skin and covered in white paint, the girls squat over large stones in the remote village after being circumcised - a life-threatening custom banned in the country three years ago. Tearful: One of the young girls, covered in an animal skin, cries after being circumcised. The practice was outlawed three years ago . Frightened: Four young Pokot girls stand outside one of the girl's homes just before the beginning of their circumcision ceremony . Adorned: After the ceremony, the girls, now covered in animal skins and beaded necklaces, walk to where they will rest after the tribal ritual . Painted: After the ritual, the girls faces are painted white to show they have been circumcised and transitioned into womanhood . Scared: One girl, after her ceremony, walks to a resting place covered in an animal skin in the remote village of Pokot in Baringo County . More than a quarter of Kenyan women have undergone the ordeal, despite government efforts to end the practice in the East African country. 'It's a tradition that has been happening forever,' the father of one of the girls, who asked not to be named fearing reprisal from the authorities, told Reuters from the isolated Pokot settlement some 80km from the town of Marigat. 'The girls are circumcised to get married. It's a girl's transition into womanhood,' he said. Wrapped in bright coloured shawls, the girls spent the night huddled around a fire in a thatched-roof house as local women gathered to sing and dance in support. One woman fell into a trance after sipping a local wine. Circumcision is heavily practiced among the Pokot community, and one of the girls' mothers believes it is a sign of strength. 'The pain will make her strong. She can show the rest of the community that she can endure it,' the woman said after having her daughter circumcised by a Pokot elder donning a beaded neck collar and large brass earrings. 'I'm proud of my daughter for doing this,' she said. Tradition: Despite a government ban on the practice, circumcision remains a rite of passage, particularly among poor families in rural areas . Smeared: Village elders cover a young girl's face in white paint after she is circumcised, a requirement for young girls before they can marry . Rampant: More than a quarter of women in Kenya have been circumcised, despite the government making the practice illegal in 2011 . At its most extreme, circumcision, also known as female genital mutilation, involves cutting off the clitoris and external genitalia, then stitching the vagina to reduce a woman's sexual desire. Anything from razor blades to broken glass and scissors is used. The U.N.'s Children's Fund, UNICEF, says more than 125 million women have been cut in the 29 countries in Africa and the Middle East where genital mutilation is carried out. Kenyan law provides for life imprisonment when a girl dies from the procedure, which in addition to excruciating pain, can cause haemorrhage, shock and complications in childbirth. It set up a prosecution unit in March and is currently investigating 50 cases. Officials are optimistic they can force a change in attitude but still worry that the practice is too ingrained for legal threats to have an impact. 'We face a myriad of challenges,' said Christine Nanjala, who heads the prosecuting unit. 'You will find the practice is something highly valued. You will keep quiet and you will not report it - if you do, you face reprisal.' Still, Nanjala was optimistic that genital cutting would be eventually wiped out. 'Not tomorrow but it will end, she said. 'At the end of the day, without hope, you have nothing.' Naked: Draped in animal skins, the Pokot girls sit naked on rocks before village elders perform the ritual . Wait: The Pokot girls wait in their homes to be circumcised.

"Plea: Alistair Darling has made a last-ditch appeal to Scottish voters to oppose independence in tomorrow's referendum . This is it. Here we are. After two years of campaigning, criss-crossing the length and breadth of Scotland, only 24 hours remain before we make the biggest political decision of our lives. The only question to ask yourself before you go to the polling booth is do you know what will happen if Scotland decides to break away from the UK. I certainly don’t. Day in, day out, I have asked Alex Salmond questions. I have asked him what currency Scotland will use, who will pay Scotland’s pensions, if there will be a new border, if Scotland will be a member of the European Union. And if Scotland will be a member of Nato. He has no answers. The campaign trail is littered with unanswered questions. Mr Salmond bluffs and blusters, he make assertions. And now, for the third time in this campaign, this week we find he has been deceiving us on, of all things, our National Health Service. It has been some saga. First of all, he told us David Cameron could privatise the health service in Scotland. That is not true. Responsibility for health care in Scotland is completely devolved to the Scottish parliament. Mr Salmond is, in fact, the only person in Scotland who could privatise the health service. Then we find the Scottish parliament is spending less than its budget allocation on health, so as health spending goes up in the rest of the UK, in Scotland it goes down. Scotland’s spending priorities are decided at Holyrood, nowhere else. They could improve the NHS; they could invest more in the NHS; but they don’t. Instead, they have spent less on health in Government than their counterparts in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. And as if that wasn’t bad enough, we now find health boards throughout Scotland are facing draconian cuts of around £450million. We were not meant to know until Friday, the day after Scotland went to the polls, but thanks to a leaked report we know now. It is not a report drawn up by politicians, but by finance directors and Scottish Government officials. Debate: Mr Darling has repeatedly clashed with Alex Salmond over Scotland's plans for independence . Head-to-head: The two rivals were interviewed by Andrew Marr in Edinburgh on Sunday . How dare Mr Salmond try to deceive us, to let us vote on a false prospectus. But we should not be surprised. He has a track record. When asked if he sought legal advice on Scotland joining the EU, he said he had. He spent taxpayers’ money going to court to stop the publication of that advice and then we found it didn’t exist in the first place. And then, only last month, the Bank of England took the unprecedented step of publicly denying SNP claims that they had discussed plans for a currency union. The Bank said there had been no such talks. I have been accused of scaremongering. It is not scaremongering to tell the truth. I don’t think it is scaremongering to ask questions. I think it is my patriotic duty. Every pensioner in Scotland deserves to know how their pension will be paid. They need to know it will be safe. At the moment, the UK guarantees the pensions throughout the UK. The costs are spread across 60million people. If Scotland breaks away, Scottish pensioners will be dependent on five million people in Scotland. Down to the wire: The polls are almost tied in the independence referendum with just a day to go . Passion: A pro-independence rally in central Glasgow today attracted a large crowd . In the next few years, Scotland will have a bigger proportion of retirement age inhabitants and fewer people working than in other parts of the UK. No matter how you look at it, the circle is hard to square. Where will the money come from? Alex Salmond has said the SNP would be willing to pay pensions to people earlier if the UK breaks up. The independent experts at the Institute of Fiscal Studies have said a separate Scotland would face extra cuts of £6billion. That’s equivalent to nearly the entire pensions budget at present – far less unfunded promises in the future. Whatever decision is made tomorrow, there is no going back. It is irreversible. Whatever the outcome, we can’t change our minds. I hear people say this referendum is a battle between head and heart. Well, believe me, my head says No. But my heart says No too. For Scotland’s sake, for the sake of my children and their children. Voting No does not mean there will be No change. All three main parties have pledged to deliver more powers for Scotland. It makes sense to give Scottish people control over our own daily lives while relying on the UK to secure the defence, prosperity and welfare of every citizen. Scots have made a tremendous contribution to the UK’s success. We faced down fascism in the Second World War, standing alone for many months; we founded and built the most socially just health service in the world; and the UK had the strength to withstand the financial crash that crippled other countries. If we stay together, the NHS will be safer, our pensions will be more secure, our schools, further education colleges and universities will be protected and there will be greater employment opportunities for our children and our grandchildren. These are the issues I care about, and I believe the majority of Scots do too. Campaign: Mr Darling at the centre of a crowd during a rally in Glasgow . Controversy: Police officers outside a No campaign event to guard against potential unrest . Most serious businessmen and women in Scotland want to stay in the UK. That is simply because they know what is best for business and what is best for jobs in Scotland. Scotland sells twice as much to the rest of the UK as it does to the rest of the world. Around one million jobs in Scotland are linked directly to trade with the rest of the UK. Our shipbuilders want to stay within the UK because they know the UK Government will not commission ships in a foreign land. Our farmers want to stay within the UK because they know their biggest market is in England. Our manufacturers want to stay in the UK because anything getting in the way of trade, such as borders and different tax regimes, is bad for them. Everyone’s vote tomorrow is crucial. It’s not like a normal election, where it only counts in your constituency. Scotland is one big constituency, so every vote counts the same. Don’t let the Nationalists tell you otherwise. And don’t let them intimidate you either. They’ll try and make out that somehow a No vote is a vote against Scotland. Over the last few weeks, some of their extremists have been too eager to throw around words such as ‘traitor’, ‘quisling’ and ‘slave’. Well, they won’t bully me. Don’t let them bully you either. I don’t want anyone who wants us to stay in the UK to wake up on Friday morning, to turn on the TV or the radio and realise they’ve forgotten to act. By then, it will be too late. A single vote could decide this referendum. One more for Yes than No and that’s it – the 307-year-old Union will end. There is no second chance, no rewind button, no point complaining we didn’t know. This is our only chance. So please act. I’m not exaggerating when I say Thursday is probably the most important day of our democratic lives. From 7am until 10pm, Scotland and the UK will be in limbo, and everything which we have built over these past three centuries will hang in the balance. For the sake of future generations, we should vote No tomorrow.","Chairman of Better Together makes a final heartfelt plea .

"It's not exactly the sort of father-son moment most parents dream of. But Arkansas governor Mike Beebe took a moment to reflect how much his son had grown up - after agreeing to pardon him for a marijuana conviction . The pardon stems from Kyle Beebe's felony conviction for possession of marijuana with intent to deliver in 2003, when his dad was serving as the state's attorney general. Outgoing governor Beebe said the reason the pardon had taken so long was because his son, who is now 34, had not requested it until now. Governor Mike Beebe (right) said his son Kyle (left) 'took his sweet time' asking for pardon . 'I would have done it a long time ago if he'd have asked, but he took his sweet time about asking,' the governor told KATV. 'He's still embarrassed, and frankly, I was embarrassed and his mother was embarrassed. 'All of the families that go through that. It's tough on the families, but hopefully the kids learn.' Kyle was given fined following the conviction and given three years supervised probation, which he completed in 2006. Mike Beebe has served two terms as governor of Arkansas after being elected in 2006 . Governor Beebe told the news station Kyle was no different from other kids who do 'stupid stuff' when they are young and he has grown up since then. 'His mother and I were stereotypical parents from the different end of the spectrum, he said. 'She was the enabler that tried to fix everything. 'I was the nuclear bomb thrower that thought you ought to shoot him. Somewhere between those two extremes was probably the right thing to do.' In Arkansas, a pardon restores the rights of an individual after a felony conviction, including  the right to bear arms. Governor Beebe says he has issued than 700 pardons, mostly of non-violent offenders. He said: 'Especially young people with drugs if they've straightened up, to get their life back on track and have a second chance, so this is no different.' In a pardon application letter to his father Kyle Beebe wrote: 'I am asking for a second chance to be a better son to my parents and prove to them that I am the person they raised me to be. 'At the time of my arrest I was living in a fantasy world, not reality. I was young and dumb. 'At that time in my life I felt like I was missing something and I tried to fill that emptiness by selling drugs.'

"Milk, cheese, butter, cream - in fact all saturated fats - are bad for you. Or so I believed ever since my days as a medical student nearly 30 years ago. During that time I assured friends and family that saturated fat would clog their arteries as surely as lard down a drain. So, too, would it make them pile on the pounds. Recently, however, I have been forced to do a U-turn. It is time to apologise for all that useless advice I've been dishing out about fat. Scroll down for video . Go ahead: New studies have found that saturated fats, found in butter, don't cause heart disease . New studies have not only failed to find a convincing link between saturated fat and heart disease, they have shattered other long-held anti-fat beliefs, too. We now have compelling evidence that low-fat diets rarely work and that eating the right kind of fat is not only good for your heart but may also help you lose weight. So why the sudden change? And what is making us fat? The roots of our current confusion lie in a paper by an American scientist called Ancel Keys in 1953. It covered the increasingly common problem of clogged arteries. Keys included a simple graph comparing fat consumption and deaths from heart disease in men from six different countries. Americans, who ate a lot of fat, were far more likely to have a heart attack than the Japanese, who ate little fat. Case solved. Or was it? Other scientists began wondering why Keys chose to focus on just six countries when he had access to data for 22. If places like France and Germany were included the link between heart disease and fat consumption became much weaker. These were, after all, countries with high fat consumption, but relatively modest rates of heart disease. Change of diet: Dr Mosley now eats more oily fish, Greek yoghurt and eggs . In fact, as a renowned British scientist called John Yudkin pointed out, there was actually a much stronger link between sugar consumption and heart disease. Professor Yudkin argued that sugar was behind the rise in heart disease ravaging the West. He also pointed to another dangerous trend emerging in Fifties Britain: the close relationship between the number of televisions being bought and fatal heart attacks. Buying a TV in the Fifties was a sign that you were affluent, but it also meant you'd spend a lot more time sitting down. This research was among the first to highlight the dangers of a sedentary lifestyle. But Yudkin's warnings about sugar were denounced by a fellow scientist as 'nothing more than scientific fraud'. He was, as one of his colleagues colourfully put it, 'thrown under a bus'. Meanwhile, the war on fat gradually gained momentum, to the extent that by the time I reached medical school in the Eighties, there was no mention of Yudkin's findings. People were cutting down on dairy products and switching to sugary carbohydrates and vegetable oils. This, it turns out, was a mistake. To turn vegetable oil into margarine, manufacturers used a process called hydrogenation (gas pumped through oil at high temperature), which produces trans fats. These are the Darth Vader of the fat world: good fats turned bad. Unlike saturated fats, there is clear evidence that trans fats damage your heart. They were found in most shop-bought biscuits and cakes until they were removed in 2007. Which was a bit late in the day for me. As a student I took the advice that saturated fats - not hydrogenated fats - were the enemy very seriously. I was slim and I did a lot of exercise, but I also ate butter and burgers. With a family history of heart disease, strokes and a father who'd just been diagnosed diabetic, I told myself it was time to act. I persuaded my father to go on a low-fat diet. He lost a little weight, but soon gave up. Reluctantly, I said goodbye to beef, switched to skimmed milk and avoided yoghurt with any hint of fat. It made for a much duller diet, but at least I was healthier. Or was I? Well, no. I kept this up for the next few decades - and the results? I put on over two stone, despite regular exercise. My cholesterol soared past the healthy range and two years ago I discovered I was borderline diabetic. While I didn't look fat, I'd piled on the pounds in the worst place possible: tucked away in my abdomen, coating internal organs. My response was to exercise more but it had little effect. I was eating less fat, but compensating with starchy pasta and potatoes. What I hadn't appreciated is the way these foods act on your body. A boiled potato will push your blood glucose up almost as fast as a tablespoon of sugar, since it is rapidly digested. Ironically, we now know that if you eat that potato with butter, the fat will slow absorption and the blood sugar peak will be less extreme. Rapid spikes in glucose force your pancreas to pump out insulin, which drives it back down, but can leave you hungry again a few hours later. Carbohydrates are also less satiating than fat or protein. So you eat more and the weight creeps up. Back on the menu: Eggs are now celebrated for their protein content while adding butter to potatoes can prevent a spike in blood sugar levels . Eggs are a prime example of how we got it wrong on fats. In the Eighties we were told they were cholesterol time bombs and were warned to eat no more than one a week. So I gave up eggs and tried to persuade my family to do likewise. What a mistake that was. A study in the British Medical Journal in 2013 concluded: 'Higher consumption of eggs is not associated with increased risk of coronary heart disease or stroke.' So eggs are back, and the protein means you'll feel fuller for longer. So, is fat really fattening? It contains far more calories than carbohydrates or protein, and the easiest way to lose weight is obviously to cut it out. Yet low-fat diets rarely succeed because people won't stick to them - they get too hungry. In the Fifties, Oxford professor Hugh Sinclair argued that we should be eating more fat, not less. He'd been to Canada and was intrigued to see that the Inuit had a high-fat diet yet low rates of heart disease. Was something in oily fish protecting them? He decided to find out by eating nothing but seal, oily fish, molluscs and crustaceans. While making Medical Mavericks for the BBC, I decided to repeat his experiment. Thankfully, the seal we tried to import was impounded by customs, so I ate a diet mainly of fish. Sinclair stuck to his for three months, I managed a month. While on his diet, Sinclair timed how long it took for his blood to clot by cutting himself once a week. It increased from three minutes to a terrifying 50. For me, it doubled. Even though he'd taken it to dangerous extremes, Sinclair showed that fish oils reduce the stickiness of platelets in your blood and thus the risk of clot formation, which can lead to a heart attack or stroke. A more recent example of how wrong we were about low-fat diets was the Look Ahead trial, which began in 2001. Over 5,000 overweight diabetics were put on a low-fat diet and encouraged to exercise. The NHS says the average man should eat no more than 30g of saturated fat a day, and the average woman no more than 20g . After almost ten years the study was stopped. Those on the low-fat diet had lost little more than a control group, and there was no significant change in heart attacks or strokes. A study last year put a further nail in the low-fat diet's coffin. A group of 7,500 men and women were randomly allocated a low-fat diet or a much higher-fat Mediterranean one. On this diet, along with fruit, vegetables, meat and fish, they were to eat oily nuts, olive oil and have a glass of wine with their meal. Again, the trial was stopped early. But this time it was because those on the Mediterranean diet were doing so much better than those on the low-fat diet, with a 30 per cent drop in heart attacks and strokes. So some fats are good for us, but surely saturated fats are bad? Even this has been undermined by a study funded by the British Heart Foundation and published this year. Based on 72 previous studies the researchers found no evidence that saturated fats cause heart disease. This isn't a licence to pour cream down your throat, because even if saturated fats don't directly harm the heart, too many calories will. Personally, I try not to have biscuits and cakes in our house as I know I can't resist them. But I have gone back to butter, Greek yoghurt and semi-skimmed milk. I eat more oily fish, eggs and the odd burger. After all those years believing them the enemy, saturated fats taste more delicious than ever. Dr Michael Mosley is the author of The Fast Diet.

"Accused: Patryk Borys allegedly helped bury his friend's girlfriend alive in a shallow grave . A terrified mother was buried alive in a cardboard box by the boyfriend who wanted rid of her, a court heard yesterday. Michelina Lewandowska, 27, was shot with a 300,000-volt Taser stun gun by Marcin Kasprzak, 25, who was allegedly bored with her and thought she was not pretty enough. She was bound and gagged with parcel tape and put in a box with two small air holes, a jury was told. She was put in the boot of a car, driven to a wooded area and buried in a ‘shallow grave’. Kasprzak and a friend, Patryk Borys, 18, used shovels to pile soil on the box and then put a tree branch weighing more than six stone on top of it, Leeds Crown Court heard. Fearing the consequences of crying out, Miss Lewandowska kept quiet throughout the ordeal and as far as the men were concerned she could have been unconscious, the jury was told. They ‘simply left her there’ and drove to a supermarket cashpoint where they used her bank cards to withdraw £500 of her money. Over the next hour their victim, ‘with great difficulty’, managed to get out of the box and escape from the makeshift grave. She stumbled to a nearby road and raised the alarm by flagging down a motorist. The court heard that Miss Lewandowska and Kasprzak – who met six years ago in their native Poland before moving to work in England – have a three-year-old son, Jakub. However, Kasprzak was ‘bored’ with his partner. He told her she was not as good-looking as the girls he saw at the gym. He would go out with friends, sometimes staying out all night, rather than spending time  with her. He allegedly wanted her removed from the scene so he could look after Jakub without her and pursue a relationship with another girlfriend. Both Kasprzak and Borys deny attempted murder in May this year. Prosecutor Jonathan Sharp told the court that Kasprzak had changed his Facebook  status to ‘single’ about two weeks before the attack and developed a plan of killing his partner. He recruited his Polish friend Borys to help and spent the night before the incident with another girlfriend. The following day Kasprzak arranged for his mother to take his son out and, the jury heard, put his plan into action at the family home in Huddersfield. 'Left for dead': Michalina Lewandowska was allegedly buried alive near Woodsome Hall Golf Club, Huddersfield . Using the stun gun he tried to ‘immobilise’ his girlfriend by twice discharging 300,000 volts into her neck. Mr Sharp said the two men bound her at the wrists and ankles and gagged her. ‘Michelina was not paralysed,’ said Mr Sharp. ‘But nevertheless, as you can well imagine, she was terrified and she agreed to do whatever he wanted.’ The men emptied the house of her clothes, which they dumped outside with the rubbish, and put their victim into a cardboard box just 22in deep which had contained a computer. She would probably have been curled up inside with her knees tucked up towards her chin, the jury was told. They carried the box up steps and into the boot of Kasprzak’s Vauxhall Astra. Mr Sharp said the defendants dug a hole big enough to take the box in woodland on a hill near Huddersfield. Terror: Michalina Lewandowska, 27,  was allegedly shot with a Taser at her home in Huddersfield (pictured) ‘They carried Michelina, sealed in the box, up the hill, placed her in the hole, and then piled earth both around and on top of the box,' he said. 'They found a large branch and placed it across the box.’ By the time they finished, the airholes on the box were obscured by earth, the jury heard. Mr Sharp added: ‘When they put Michelina, who was not making a sound, in a shallow grave and put earth around and on top of her, they intended to kill her. But by great good fortune, they failed to kill her. ‘To bury somebody alive has very well-known consequences. After a very short time that person will die from lack of oxygen. ‘The Crown says it is plain not just that Kasprzak and Borys well knew that, but they intended her to die from lack of oxygen.’ Tasered: Michelina Lewandowska, 27, was allegedly shot with a 300,000 volt Taser stun gun (similar to the one pictured) by her boyfriend . Both men returned to the car and drove a short distance to a Morrisons supermarket, where they were captured on CCTV using a cash machine at 11.01pm. Miss Lewandowska was spotted by a motorist at 11.55pm and police arrested both suspects later that night at Borys’s house in Huddersfield. Mr Sharp told the court both men would admit being involved, but claim they did not intend to kill their victim. The case continues.

"He won his battle against throat cancer more than ten years ago. Now Geoffrey Boycott has revealed his strategy for preventing the illness reappearing – taking 16 different vitamins and supplements every day. The veteran England cricketer, 73, said yesterday he had researched online different foods and supplements which are known to help combat cancer. His new regime, which includes taking garlic, carcumin and echinacea tablets, has also seen him give up sugar and dairy products. Scroll down for video . Cricket legend Geoffrey Boycott, centre, with his partner Rachel, right and daughter Emma, left, said he now takes 16 different vitamins every day in order to stop his throat cancer from returning . He revealed he now only drinks green tea, after discovering research suggesting that milk can hasten the return of cancer. Boycott was diagnosed with cancer in 2002 but after a gruelling spell of radiation treatment, he went into remission. Speaking yesterday at the Cheltenham Literature Festival, said he had also tried alternative therapies, including Feng Sui and visiting a medium. And the famously grumpy commentator said that surviving cancer has made him feel less cross – because the illness has put things into perspective. Boycott, who was awarded OBE after his retirement from his international career in 1982, was at first reluctant to talk openly about his illness after his diagnosis. But yesterday, the Test Match Special commentator said he wanted to inspire other people with his new book about his experiences, The Corridor of Certainty. He said: ‘There’s a lot of knowledge out there that you’re not being given that can help people to stay alive. ‘I take 16 tablets a day of various vitamins. Echinacea, omega fish oils, garlic, carcumin, all sorts of things like that. I’ve been taking them for 12 years. As well as taking vitamins, the former cricketer, pictured, said he now drinks green tea and avoids milk . ‘I eat whatever. But I watch what I eat in terms of I’m aware, which many people aren’t and I wasn’t before, that cancer loves sugar. Get rid of sugar. Also get rid of dairy – not good for you. ‘I drink a lot of green tea. I used to be a tea drinker but now I drink a lot of green tea because it has no milk. ‘But other than that, I eat normal fish, meat, what have you.’ Told by one audience member that he looked amazing, he quipped: ‘Really? Well I’ve got a chance with Kim Basinger then. She was 60 at Christmas, so she’ll be just right for me.’ He added that when he was diagnosed with cancer, he was ready to try anything – leading him to alternative therapies. ‘There are things in life that we don’t totally understand,’ he added. ‘And I always felt that China is the oldest civilisation in the whole world. ‘I went to a medium. I was open to Feng Shui. If you’re going to die, I’m receptive to anything and I think you have to be.’ He said recounted how, at the height of the illness, he had burn pads on his neck because of the radiation and was dosed up with morphine. Boycott said he regularly researched different foods and supplements on the internet . He said his wife Margaret Rachel Swinglehurst, acted as a ‘buddy’ to ‘frighten’ him into eating well and taking his meditation. After all the trauma of his illness, he said he has mellowed in comparison to his days on the cricket pitch. ‘People around me say it has changed me,’ he said. ‘I don’t think it can change what you’re born with, your DNA. But it can have a rounding off of the edges. ‘I do see things differently. When I get cross and I swear, I stop then I think, hang on – no point. ‘In the big picture, I’ve had 12 years and I might have been dead – some people are. It teaches you to look forward and say “hey, come on, it’s not really that important.” ‘Just get over it quicker. Sometimes I don’t get as cross as I did.’","Geoffrey Boycott said he changed his diet completely after beating cancer .

"David Murdoch has paid an emotional tribute to his father Matt after he died suddenly at the age of 70 from a suspected heart attack . A fortnight ago he led the British men’s curling team to Olympic silver in Sochi as his father watched proudly from a few feet away in the audience. But yesterday a shocked David Murdoch found himself paying an emotional tribute to his father Matt after he died suddenly at the age of 70 from a suspected heart attack. Mr Murdoch Snr inspired the men’s team skip to take up curling as a boy – and both he and his wife Marion travelled to Russia to watch the 35-year-old achieve Olympic glory last month. But days after watching the highlight of his son’s career, Mr Murdoch, of Lockerbie, Dumfriesshire, has passed away, plunging his family into grief. In a statement issued last night, David Murdoch, 35, said: ‘Myself and my entire family are shocked and devastated following the sudden loss of my father Matt. ‘My dad was a three-time Scottish curling champion and former president of the Royal Caledonian Curling Club. ‘He was a brilliant dad to us all. My mum and dad inspired me, my brother and sister to take up curling and have done so much to help us all in our careers in addition to helping to inspire many others to take up the sport. 'I dedicated my recent Sochi Olympic success to my parents, without whom I wouldn’t be where I am today. ‘My dad will be missed by us all and was so happy to see me and touch the medal he has helped my whole life to aim towards.’ The statement concluded: ‘Our dad was much loved – by all our family, by his friends and by the curling community.’ In Lockerbie, friends and fellow curlers described Mr Murdoch Snr as ‘one of the great men of the game’ and expressed shock that he had died so unexpectedly and so shortly after the homecoming celebrations. Proud: Matt Murdoch inspired his son David to take up curling as a boy and watched the 35-year-old achieve Olympic glory last month . Alastair Stevenson, chairman of the town’s ice rink, said: ‘Our thoughts are obviously with the family. 'We’ve known Matt a long time and the family have been involved in the ice rink for a long time and everyone is just very sorry it has happened at this time. Matt was extremely happy as to what had happened, whether that is any comfort or not. But he was very pleased about his son’s success. ‘He was a director of the ice rink and past chairman and Marion is a coach at the ice rink. She is one of the reasons for the success of these kids over the years.’ Mr Stevenson added: ‘Mr Murdoch was a keen curler, played cricket regularly and golf from time to time.’ David Murdoch (cenrte) delivers a stone while Scott Andrews (right) and Michael Goodfellow sweep during the semifinal match between Sweden and Great Britain in the men's curling competition in  Sochi . epa04088956 . EPA/TATYANA ZENKOVICH . Lockerbie is planning to mark the achievements of the curling teams but Mr Stevenson said at the moment they were just thinking about the family. He said: ‘It’s just such a shock for someone who was as happy as Larry. I wouldn’t say he was basking in the glory, he was just enjoying it. 'He said it had been a great experience and fantastic to be there to see his son win an Olympic medal.’ Mr Murdoch Snr had been curling earlier this week at Lockerbie Ice Rink and was due to compete in a tournament near Paisley yesterday. Team-mate and close friend Bobby Rae said: ‘I just can’t take it in. We played together for 42 years. It certainly came as a huge shock to me. I was with him two days last week at a tournament and we had a great time. We shared a room together and he seemed fine, as far as I could tell.’ David Murdoch celebrates winning the semi final match between Sweden and Great Britain at Ice Cube Curling Centre in Sochi, Russia . Mr Rae added: ‘He will be a big miss to me and many, many others. I just can’t believe it’s happened.’ Before setting off for Sochi, David Murdoch acknowledged the pivotal role his parents had played in giving him his start in curling. He said: ‘I must have spent my entire childhood in the rink. ‘Most people don’t start learning to curl until they are 12 or older but I was already on the ice because my parents were heavily involved in the rink. ‘My dad has been chairman a few times and mum is one of the coaches there. It was almost a second family home.’ His siblings caught the curling bug early, too. His sister Nancy is the assistant national men’s coach while brother Neil is a former European champion.","David Murdoch paid tribute to his father Matt who died from a suspected heart attack .

"Cristiano Ronaldo says he would love to play for Manchester United again, one day. Lionel Messi has vaguely mentioned United as one of the very few clubs other than Barcelona whose shirt he would even remotely consider wearing, one day. Bastian Schweinsteiger, Arjen Robben, Thiago Silva, and Neymar are among those who have hinted that Old Trafford would be their preferred destination should they ever appear in the Premier League, one day. The way the transfer mania is going it could happen for all of them, for just one day each. VIDEO Scroll down for Ronaldo: Falcao and Di Maria excellent players for  United . One day: With the current loan situation, it may soon reach the point where we see Cristiano Ronaldo back in a Manchester United shirt, but just for a single game . A Messi situation: Could it be that Lionel Messi would turn out for United at some point? VIDEO 'Sensational' Premier League spending not slowing down . Now we have reached the scandalous point at which clubs the size of United are allowed to borrow leading players for a season or so, then why not for one match? If Real Madrid have an easy game one weekend and a big lead in La Liga, why not pick up a few million quid to let Ronaldo pop over to Manchester for a key Premier League fixture? Then, if United have a defender crisis on a vital Saturday, let’s give Silva a shed-load of dosh and a day return ticket on the Eurostar from Paris. Sounds crazy? No more lunatic than the beg-and-lend lunacy upon which the transfer window has just closed. As it happens, this is the logical progression into a madness which descended to its lowest ebb yet with Radamel Falcao going to Old Trafford on loan. Falcao is touted as one of the best forwards in the world. Yet Monaco have leased him out to United like a hire car. Given the gross amounts of money involved, this is little short of obscene. It is not players and deals like this for which the loan system was invented. The concept was for up-and-coming fringe players at big clubs to gain first team experience lower down the leagues, thereby helping the smaller clubs as well in the process. It was not created so mega-clubs could gain temporary use of superstars. Nor was it designed originally for the Chelseas of this world to sign as many of the best and most promising footballers they can get their hands on and then farm out a couple of dozen of them. Enabling Chelsea to use some of their owner’s billions of roubles to exert as close a monopoly of the world’s top talent as they can muster was never the idea. Seeking agreement that the borrowers do not field those loan players in matches against themselves perverts the integrity of the Premier League. Everton have finally made an honest man of Romelu Lukaku. But how could it have been right that he scored goals against Chelsea’s Premier League rivals while not permitted to play against the Blues themselves? Grinners are winners: Bayern Munich duo Arjen Robben (left) and Bastian Schweinsteiger both admire United . Boys from Brazil: Neymar (left) and Thiago Silva have hinted they could play for United one day . That has been one of several similar contradictions which corrupt the flagship competition of the English game. Driving the wrong way: Radamel Falcao was leased to Manchester United like a hire car . United have performed their Falcao trick in reverse by sending Tom Cleverley – an England midfielder, by the way – on loan to Aston Villa. And can the Champions League consider itself immune? Remember Chelsea kicking up a stink about their man Thibaut Courtois keeping goal against them for Atletico Madrid, then demanding money if he did so? The excuse for all these convolutions is that they enable clubs to live under UEFA’s fair play wage cap, that this is nothing more than financial juggling. The reality is that loans between major clubs threaten the ethos of the game we know and love. Loyalty, of course, has long gone out of the transfer window. But now – albeit travelling in private jets - football’s supposed aristocrats are bartering like beggars in the streets with nobody much caring upon which money-grubbing corner they end up squatting. For this mess to be cleared up it has to be a case of if you can’t afford to buy, you can’t sign the man. To be clear, United and Chelsea are by no means alone in lawfully exploiting the regulations as they stands. Out of Old Trafford: Tom Cleverley moved on loan from United to Aston Villa . They are pretty much all at it. Largely to the detriment of the young English player and our national team, by the way,. If a stop is to be put to this unseemly haggling, laws need to be implemented which: . 1) Prohibit player loans between Premier League clubs – and between clubs in the top divisiions of all countries in Europe; . 2) Limit the number of players who can be registered by any club, be they on that club’s payroll or on loan elsewhere. Sounds simple? Do not expect the Premier League, the FA or UEFA to initiate such action any time soon. But, hopefully, as Monaco fans begin queuing to demand refunds on their season tickets because Falcao has been lent to Old Trafford, the economics of the game may force them to do so. One day. Sterling the bright spark (let's hope he doesn't burn out) Raheem Sterling was the one bright spark against Norway in the first game of the post-Brazil World Cup era.

Sterling work: The England youngster wins the penalty against Norway on Wednesday night . Because nothing seems to have changed since the sorry retreat from Rio. England still need to prove there is any point in them possessing so much of the ball. And as for the hugely promising Sterling, if he fades again, the way he did in Brazil after that bright start against Italy, then England may even prove that it is possible not to qualify for a European Championship purpose-designed so that all the big-to-middling nations go through. Heaven forbid.","Monaco leased Radamel Falcao to Manchester United like a hire car .

"The parents of a severely-epileptic boy have found a life-altering treatment for his painful syndrome. Kim and Chris Clark's son Caden was diagnosed with Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome, an illness which causes the 10-year-old boy to suffer 10 to 100 seizures a day. But after moving to Colorado, Caden can now go days without a single seizure thanks to a special strain of marijuana called Charlotte's Web, named after the famous children's book. Over the years, the Clarks have tried over 20 drugs, a brain lobectomy and extreme diets to treat Caden's syndrome but still the seizures persisted. Scroll down for video .

They were running out of hope last year, when Caden reached 'expiration age, a point at which the seizures become increasingly frequent and deadly. That's when they heard about the revolutionary strain of medical marijuana oil that was being used to treat other children like Caden. Charlotte's Web was developed five years ago by Colorado company Realm of Caring, as a drug for cancer patients. The strain was once called 'Hippie's Disappointment' since it doesn't get users high, due to a lower amount of THC and higher amount of cannabidoil (CBD). Medical authorities still have not found conclusive evidence that CBD limits seizures, but the Clarks have seen the good it can do after just one month. Chris Clark was hesitant to give his child the drug at first, however, since he has worked for the Atlanta Police Department for 26 years and currently is in charge of their drug evidence inventory. 'I was real nervous about what my peers would think about me doing this,' Mr Clark told the Guardian. 'I finally came to the conclusion that if there is a chance that this product could help my child, then you've got to do it.' Hesitation: Mr Clark was hesitant to use the drug on his son at first, since he has worked in law enforcement for the last 26 years and currently is in charge of the Atlanta Police Department's drug evidence inventory. But They tried Charlotte's Web as a last ditch effort and saw improvement almost immediately. Mrs Clark (left) says her son (right) can now go days without a seizure . Mrs Clark moved to Colorado Springs with Caden and his 13-year-old brother Jackson in December while Mr Clark stayed at home to continue to work. The Clarks put Caden on a waiting list and were cleared to start using Charlotte's Web for the first time on May 31. They noticed an instant improvement since Caleb could go whole days without a single seizure. In April, Mrs Clark spoke with Atlanta news station WSB-TV over Skype, detailing how her son's improving quality of life. 'He's not having hundreds of seizures in the last week. He's had seven. It's huge for us,' she said. 'And that may not last. We're not saying it's a miracle cure, but it means a world of difference for us.' Today, more than 400 families are using Charlotte's Web to treat their seizure-prone condition and thousands more are on a waiting list. Many, like the Clarks, have found the drug to be useful, but others have not been so lucky. Mrs Clark says she knows a few families who have left Colorado after the drug failed to help their children. And doctors at Children's Hospital Colorado say some patients have had negative experiences using the drug, and been submitted to the intensive care unit/ . Dr Orrin Devinsky, who runs the NYU Epilepsy Center, is one of the doctors who has started early testing of the drug in its use with children. 'It's common for people hearing incredibly wonderful anecdotal stories to feel like they know the answer, and no one should like today, based on the data, that anyone has any of the answers about safety or efficacy,' Dr Devinsky told the Guardian.","Caden Clark, 10, was diagnosed with Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome, an illness which causes him to suffer 10-100 seizures a day .

"A Denver father says he's been forced to watch his daughter be twice resuscitated and battle for her life after taking a sample of a tainted rave drug. According to a Facebook post that has quickly gone viral with more than 17,000 shares, Keith Roehm said his daughter Bianca ended up in the hospital after attending an electronic dance music festival called Skylab at the Denver Coliseum on Sunday. While there she took Molly, which he claimed was part of a 'bad batch' that had circulated and poisoned several other people at Sklab. Bianca Roehm ended up in the hospital after attending an electronic dance music festival called Skylab at the Denver Coliseum on Sunday . Bianca has since made some strides towards recovery, sitting up and speaking softly . The 17-year-odl Denver East High School student is now in critical condition. 'She is now on life support and going into renal failure. Her heartbeat was at 165 beats per minute and her temperature was at 108 degrees for 20 minutes,' Roehm wrote. 'They had to resuscitate her twice. My daughter died in front of us twice! On 9-16-14 her brother, Evan, had an episode and decided to drink bleach, and although he's in a seperate hospital, I have tell him that his sister might not make it, and I could seriously use some help right now...Please share this to bring awareness to what happens at these raves.' 'Molly' is a term for a purified version of amphetamine drug MDMA, widely known as Ecstasy, favored in club culture. Father Keith Roehm claims several other people at Skylab were endangered by a batch of tainted drugs . 'This could be your child,' Roehm wrote. 'Mine was responsible and did well in school. These raves are death peddlers...' A Go Fund Me page has been set up seeking $10,000 to help with Bianca's medical care and has received $440 in donations so far. A recent update to the page claimed she was still in critical condition but appeared to be improving. 'She woke up this morning, sat up, whispered something, then went back to sleep!

"He might be about to become a father for a second time but it seems that the Duke of Cambridge already has his hands full with Prince George. Handed a bag of Christmas bells by nine-year-old Dylan Marten Hughes during an event  last night, the Duke joked that he knew 'just what to do' with them and went on to tell the delighted children of his plans to use them as a means of keeping track of his son. 'I'll probably put them in his pocket, we'll know where he is then,' the Duke added. Scroll down for videos . Christmas bells? We need those for Prince George, revealed the Duke of Cambridge during a gala last night . Prince William met the children during a visit to the Imperial War Museum, where he attended a gala dinner on behalf of SkillForce, a charity that matches troubled children with mentors drawn from the armed forces. William was without his wife for the event, who earlier the same day had visited the GSK Human Performance Lab in Brentford on behalf of charity, SportsAid. The Duchess of Cambridge, 32, is thought to be around 16 weeks pregnant, although barely a hint of a baby bump could be seen under her plum dress by British label, Goat. During a speech at the dinner, the Duke, 32, said that remembrance 'must never become the preserve or responsibility of one generation' and called on young people to show their support. 'I was privileged to be able to visit the poppy installation at the Tower of London in its early days,' he continued. Keeping track: According to a proud Duke of Cambridge, George is keeping his parents on their toes . Support: The Duke meets SkillForce ambassador Kate Adie during a gala dinner at the Imperial War Museum . Patron: The Duke has been involved with SkillForce, which mentors troubled children, since 2009 . On his own: The Duke of Cambridge was without his wife for the Imperial War Museum event . 'Even then, before it was as famous as it is now, the people observing the poppies came from every generation. 'The young there were just as moved as the old. Their grief and thanksgiving for the sacrifice of previous generations was just as real.' He was speaking three days after joining the Queen to lay wreaths of poppies at the Cenotaph in London's Whitehall to commemorate those who have made the ultimate sacrifice. The Duke has been patron of SkillForce since 2009 and joined the charity to celebrate the launch of the Junior Prince's Award - a programme that aims to help children prepare for secondary school via 'character-building' activities and projects. Important: During a speech, William called on the young to do their bit to remember Britain's war dead . Honour: On Sunday, the Duke joined Prince Edward and the Duke of Edinburgh at the Cenotaph . Remembrance: The service was led by the Queen and also saw Prince Charles lay a wreath . Mr Marten Hughes, from Watford, was among a group of children invited to meet the Prince at the Imperial War Museum, along with Thomas Brooker and Ellis Knight, both 10. Their Remembrance Day project, a figure laden with red poppies, each of which represented a fallen soldier, certainly met with William's approval. 'It was clear that they, like those children who gather at the Tower of London or at Remembrance Day parades, are grasping something that will instil hopefulness and commitment about a better future in themselves and in their generation,' he said afterwards. 'This is no small achievement. Only by pointing to all that remembrance means can we have any chance of making our society a better place and giving these young people hope, which is the fuel for all the work they will need to do to fulfil their potential.'

"A mother searching for the son she gave up for adoption 50 years ago has told of her grief at learning only recently that he was killed in the 1988 Lockerbie Bombing. Carol King Eckersley, 65, from Oregon in the US, gave up her newborn son Kenneth Bissett when she was 19 years old. But this year, following the death of her husband, she decided to try to track him down. Grief: Carol King Eckersley, 65, from Oregon, has just discovered that the son she gave up for adoption 50 years ago was killed in the 1988 Lockerbie bombing . Her hunt led her to a remembrance . website for the 35 students of New York's Syracuse University who were killed in . the 1988 atrocity on which she was stunned to find a picture of young man . with a familiar-looking face. After checking the date of birth she realised he was her long lost son. Mrs King Eckersley tells her story in a BBC documentary commissioned to mark the 25th anniversary of the Lockerbie bombing. American student Ken Bissett, was one of the 270 victims of the . Lockerbie bombing . She told the documentary: 'I looked and I said ""my God, it's him"". 'It was his birth date, he looked just like my dad. I looked in the mirror and I said ""he looks like me"". 'I called my sister and I said ""but why are they only showing a part of his life? They've got December 1967 but then they've got December 21 1988. That's not right"". 'And it finally dawned on me that it was right and I just said 'my God, my baby's dead'. 'I realised that it was the Lockerbie Pan Am 103 remembrance page and I said 'My God, he was on that plane'. 'Two hundred and seventy people died in that tragedy and one of those happened to be the only child I ever had.' Ken had been returning to the US from a term spent studying in London. He had been told he was adopted but had never met his birth mother, the daughter of a school principal who felt it would have been socially unacceptable for her to keep him. She said: 'I gave up Ken for adoption at birth and even though I was told his name I never looked for him because I had given my word. 'There was always the hope and dream that some day there would come a knock on the door and I would open it and there would be this tall, handsome gentleman saying 'hi, I guess you're my mum'.' Ken's adoptive parents are now both dead but left a detailed account of his childhood in Syracuse University's archives, where his mother saw a baby picture for the first time. She said: 'I had never seen him, except wrapped up in a yellow blanket on the day we left hospital.' She added: 'In a way, I'm going backwards...because the getting to know him makes it sharper, makes the regret deeper. He was an incredible artist. I saw comic strips that he drew when he was 11 years old.' Atrocity: Pan-Am flight 103 from London to New York exploded above the Scottish town of Lockerbie on  December 21, 1988 . Students from the University of Syracuse, read the names of the victims . at the memorial in Lockerbie, Scotland. 35 Syracuse students flying home for Christmas were killed . in the bombing . She described the feeling of never . having felt like a proper parent as a result of giving up her son. She . said: 'I have carried that stigma around. It's just a real regret that . I'll never, in this life, see him.' Pan Am Flight 103 exploded as it flew to New York from London on December 21, 1988. All 259 people aboard were killed, and 11 on the ground below in the Scottish town of Lockerbie also died. Libyan agent Abdel Basset al-Megrahi was the only person found guilty of murder.

"A baby died at just three days old of organ failure after his mother failed to control her blood sugar levels throughout her pregnancy following her struggle with her diabetes, an inquest heard. Thomas Gaskarth-Roberts was born three weeks early and had to be placed in an incubator after he was found to be 'very floppy' and didn't cry after being born. He died in Burnley General Hospital three days later. The child's mother Joanne Gaskarth is a qualified nurse with Type 1 diabetes but often forgot to provide doctors with readings of her blood sugar levels throughout her pregnancy, but said feels she is now being blamed for his death. She admitted she had struggled with her diabetes since being diagnosed at 24 and Burnley Coroners' Court heard doctors raised concerns that her levels of blood glucose were not being monitored properly throughout her pregnancy. Thomas Gaskarth-Roberts died at three days old from multiple organ failure. An inquest heard  his mother Joanne, a diabetic, had failed to properly control her blood glucose which increases the risk of stillbirth and complications. His parents provided a picture of his treatment in an incubator at Burnley General Hospital . Diabetic women have an increased risk of stillbirth if they do not control their sugar levels properly. Just before Thomas' birth Miss Gaskarth's blood sugar levels were almost five times what they should have been. The inquest heard that having poor control of her diabetes meant Miss Gaskarth was four times more likely to have a stillbirth or complications with her pregnancy and doctors said this meant they would have advised her against having a child. Speaking after the inquest Miss Gaskarth said doctors should have advised her better. She said: 'I didn't get any impression that anything was wrong. Pregnancy and diabetes in someone - I have no idea about, so why wasn't I advised? I don't understand, you go to a clinic every week but it seems it its up to you - if that's right, what's the point? Miss Gaskarth said she only occasionally forgot her records, not all the time. She said: 'I offered to go home or for someone to bring it back that day. It's alright for them to say they didn't have my readings but they take an overall blood sugar every few weeks, why didn't they pick upon it? If I was so bad why wasn't anything flagged up to me? 'If they had said at any stage 'this is serious' not to be doing this, but nobody did. It has annoyed me. You go to see medical professionals because you think they are going to advise you because it's their speciality. 'Hindsight is a wonderful thing. but I feel like I'm being blamed for it all. If all the emphasis has to be on the mum why do you have to go and seek medical advice. I knew I had responsibilities but if they were saying I was so poorly and serious why was no medical doctor looking at me straight away? 'You are supposed to bring home your baby not leave them in a mortuary. I don't want to blame anyone but the emphasis seems to be blame on me.' Miss Gaskarth had admitted having diabetes had changed her life and that despite hating needles she injected herself after she found out about her condition as her blood sugar levels were twice what they should have been. Miss Gaskarth said her blood glucose levels remained controlled. She is pictured with partner Mark Roberts . The nurse, who qualified in 1999, later controlled her condition using pump therapy, an alternative to injecting herself, which released insulin into her bloodstream. This pump also recorded her blood sugar levels. The 39-year-old unexpectedly fell pregnant with Thomas in 2012, with partner Mark Roberts, now 39, a constable with Lancashire Police. Miss Gaskarth discussed her blood sugar levels at joint antenatal and diabetes clinic sessions where her readings had been a little high at between five and seven, the inquest heard. She said she would have done anything to ensure the health of her young son and added: 'I always did what they told me, I never came out thinking I had to change anything.' But the inquest heard Miss Gaskarth, who has two older children Isobel and Max, frequently failed to bring her blood sugar records to appointments over a seven month period while she was pregnant with Thomas. She told professionals her levels were well controlled and satisfactory, running at between five and seven. However discrepancies arose after retrospective readings of her glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c)- a measurement which enables clinicians to get an overall picture of average blood sugar levels for the previous three months. Miss Gaskarth, told the inquest: 'Any suggestion I was fabricating blood sugar levels or making them up is nonsense.' Thomas was put on an incubator after he was born after doctors found he was floppy and didn't cry after birth . Thomas died of multiple organ failure and damage to his brain, caused by a lack of oxygen to the organ . She accepted that she had on occasions forgotten her blood sugar diary or pump meter but would offer to go and get it, yet was told to bring it the following week. 'I offered to go home and go back the same day, it's one of those things which got missed, it was just an oversight,' Miss Gaskarth told the inquest. Sean Hughes, consultant obstetrician at Preston Royal Hospital who discussed diabetic care with Miss Gaskarth said: 'The most glaring risk is if you have got poor control, the event of a stillbirth is four times the likelihood of a normal pregnancy. It's very easy to motivate women.' Dr Simon Howell a consultant physician said Ms Gaskarth's glycated haemoglobin levels were of concern. He said he had written to her GP expressing concerns that she had not been bringing her blood glucose record to appointments, and said they had 'never managed to achieve very good glucose control.' He added that he would have advised her not to get pregnant because the 'risks would be too high'. Diabetic women can be advised against having a baby if they have poor control of their condition because of the increased risks. Dr Stephen Walkinshaw a consultant in Maternal and Foetal Medicine at Liverpool Women's Hospital said Miss Gaskarth had an increased risk of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) - which is a recognised cause of stillbirth. Miss Gaskarth, with Thomas' father Mr Roberts, said she did everything to ensure Thomas was healthy . He added: 'Frequently she did not bring her blood glucose profile. Without this information and records it's very difficult to achieve control. Hers was rarely in the target range. Overall in my view the diabetes team did all they could. Generally her control meant it was always close to the threshold where DKA can occur.' A few weeks before Thomas was born Miss Gaskarth reported blood glucose levels of between five and seven. But when she was admitted to hospital feeling unwell they were elevated at 25. She then reported feeling ill on November 26 and phoned the hospital believing she was in the early stages of labour. Miss Gaskarth said her blood sugar levels were normal and was told to get to the hospital . Thomas was born three weeks early in December and had to be delivered using forceps. Tests showed he had high acidic levels and his blood pressure was low. He was diagnosed with high metabolic acidosis and was suffering from seizures and brain damage. Thomas died at Burnley General Hospital at 3 days . The child was placed in an incubator but died three days later from multiple organ failure and brain injury caused by a lack of oxygen, known as hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy. Coroner Richard Taylor recorded a narrative verdict and said: 'The problem was that the mother was a Type 1 diabetic and on her own admission said it was very difficult and a life changing illness to control and maintain. She accepted in the past she had problems controlling her diabetes. On her first check in hospital it showed worryingly high HbA1c levels. 'The levels did come down but blood sugar levels were consistently too high. It is the doctors' view they were not properly controlled for whatever reason. The case of a child dying, especially so young is very difficult to come to terms with or accept. 'My feelings do go out to Thomas' mother and father. ' Consultant obstetrician Dr Fiona Crossfill of the Womens Health for Lancashire Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust said that after reviewing the case they would be randomly testing Type 1 diabetes patients approximately every month. She said: 'Every time I saw Joanne, she was well controlled and said they were controlled and between four and seven and I presume she said the same to other members of the team. It would not be good practice to say 'I don't believe you.' 'Most people with poor control are actually quite up front..' Every year just over 3,000 women in England with diabetes give birth – about half have type 2 diabetes, which is linked to obesity, and the other half type 1. The condition greatly increases the risk of still birth, the baby dying shortly after labour or being born with heart problems or other defects. A report by the Health and Social Care Information Centre found that babies born to women with diabetes are six times more likely to die shortly after birth than the national average. The infant mortality rate for pregnant women with diabetes is 17 per 1,000 compared with 2.8 per 1,000 for healthy women. The report, which looked at 1,700 pregnant women, also found one in ten with type 2 diabetes were taking pills to lower blood sugar. Another 5 per cent of all pregnant women with diabetes were on statins and 2.5 per cent were on high blood pressure pills.","Thomas Gaskarth-Roberts was born early at Burnley General Hospital .

"The 9-year-old boy fatally stabbed in a Michigan playground on Monday spent his dying breaths telling his brother he loved him and re-assuring him that the shocking attack wasn’t his fault, a family member has revealed. Michael ‘Connor’ Verkerke was playing with two of his brothers and another boy Jamarion Lawhorn, 12, who pulled out a knife and repeatedly stabbed Connor. The boy's great-uncle Jim Stearns told MLive that the horrific incident had left the family ‘absolutely numb’. He said Connor had told his brother: ‘If anything happens to me, it’s not your fault. I’ll always love you,’ as the boy had rushed his dying brother back to their parent’s house in Kentwood. Horrific: Michael 'Conner' Verkerke died Monday night after being stabbed in the back multiple times and he and friends played on a playground near his home . Police Jamarion didn't know Conner before the attack. They say the two boys had been playing together when Jamarion pulled a knife out of the sand and stabbed Conner multiple times in the back . ‘Their . top priority right now is the mental health of their three remaining . children,’ Stearns said of the devastated Verkerke family. A candlelight vigil was held on Wednesday night at Pinebrook Village Mobile Home Park, the site of Monday’s deadly attack. About 100 people gathered to celebrate Connor's memory. Children . and adults both laughed and cried during the vigil, reports MLive before Stearns, who is the uncle of Connor's mom, . spoke to the crowd and everyone joined in to sing Jesus . Loves Me. Community . members honored Connor's memory with teddy bears, passed out by vigil . organizers, placed next to a cross on the side of the playground. A candlelight vigil was held on Wednesday night at Pinebrook Village Mobile Home Park, the site of Monday's deadly attack . Stearns . said the incident has 'terrorized' the park for kids - in particular, . two of Connor’s brothers who were with him when the attack occurred. 'They’re afraid,' he said. The Verkerke family were also concerned about the Jamarion Lawhorn's family. 'Even though . we’re dealing with a different type of pain, they’ll be dealing with a . similar pain every day for the rest of their lives. That’s not to be . taken lightly,' said Stearns. The community has some together to help Conner's mom pay for his funeral. A Go Fund Me page set up yesterday has already raised more than $13,000 from 321 people. The Grand Rapids Press . reports that Jamarion sobbed and trembled as he appeared in court on . Tuesday to face murder charges. Even the prosecutor, who has opted to . try him in juvenile court as an adult, remarked that he looked 'tiny' and younger than his age. His mother appeared in court with him and wiped away his tears and rubbed his back to comfort him. About 100 people gathered on Wednesday night to celebrate Connor's memory and sing Jesus Loves Me . Shocking: . Jamarion Lawhorn, 12, is charged with murder. He will be tried as an . adult in juvenile court. Even prosecutors said he looked small and young . for his age . Jamarion's lawyer entered a 'not guilty' plea and asked that the boy undergo a psychological examination to determine if he is fit to stand trial. The 12-year-old did, however, tell a judge that he understood the charges against him. Under Michigan law, Jamarion could be given a 'blended' sentence if he is convicted, which would keep him in a juvenile detention facility until he is 21. After that, a judge would determine whether he should be released or sent to adult prison. Police say that Jamarion's attack on Conner was unprovoked and inexplicable. He didn't know Conner before the attack and had joined the 9-year-old and two friends on the playground. Horrific: A 9-year-old boy died at the hospital after being attacked on the playground by a 12-year-old, police say. He was stabbed at least once in the back with a kitchen knife . Random: Police say the 12-year-old didn't know the young boy he attacked and he didn't live in the trailer park near the playground . Suddenly, . he pulled a knife out of the sand and stabbed Conner multiple times in . the back, authorities say. Police aren't saying where Jamarion got the . weapon. Conner . ran to his home house nearby and collapsed on the porch. He was taken . to the hospital in critical condition an died hours later. Authorities . say Jamarion is the youngest child ever charged with murder in Kent . County - and one of the youngest in the state of Michigan. An . 11-year-old boy was convicted of killing his mother's boyfriend in 1997 . in Pontiac, Michigan. Witness Glen Stacy told the Press he was doing yard work when Jamarion approached him and asked to borrow his cell phone. Mr Stacy said he assumed the child was calling him mother. Instead the 12-year-old called cops and admitted to a brutal crime. Mr Stacy says the boy told police: 'I want to die. I don’t want to be on this earth anymore. Please pick me up.' Witness: Glen Stacy says the 12-year-old suspect asked to borrow his cell phone then called 911 and admitted he had killed . He says Jamarion told him that he lashed out because he had 'taken many pills' and nobody loved him. The 12-year-old was eerily calm and patiently waited for police, Mr Stacy told the Press. He only became animated when police finally arrived - and didn't immediately arrest him. Mr Stacy said the first emergency personnel went to the playground to help the victim. This upset the boy. 'Hello. I’m right here. You’re going the wrong way,' Jamarion shouted as officers arrived. When police did finally come for him, he walked toward the cops with his hands out in front of him - showing he wanted to be handcuffed.","Michael 'Connor' Verkerke was fatally stabbed while playing in a Michigan playground on Monday .

"The British terrorist dubbed ‘Jihadi John’ has been described as a 'dead man walking' by commentators as the UK's security services seek to track him down and bring him to justice. But while some experts have suggested he has been identified by MI5 and MI6, his sickening appearance in this ISIS video is a reminder of how much work British agents must do before they bring his reign of terror to an end. The best hope for eliminating him may come from the skies. Last week it was revealed the US has begun sorties using drones equipped with the latest cameras and weapons over Raqqa in northern Syria – where it is believed ISIS is holding Western hostages. Scroll down for video . Search: The hunt for 'Jihadi John' was sparked by the release of the first beheading video in which US journalist James Foley was killed by a man with a London accent . It is hoped footage taken by US drones in northern Syria may help in tracking him down and targeting him . It has also been reported that President Obama would approve an immediate strike on Jihadi John if drone operators reported they had found him. Intelligence experts are certain to forensically examine the latest video for new clues as to his whereabouts. On first viewing, the outline of the desert background behind David Haines looks similar to the scene behind Steven Sotloff, the US aid worker whose beheading was also broadcast online by IS. The video only shows the bleak ground immediately behind them. This would suggest that IS has learned from the video of the beheading of US journalist James Foley, where a green plain in the distance was enough to allow computer experts to pinpoint the exact location in the hillsides of Raqqa. British and US security forces are said to have been studying the fighter's movement, speech and the weapon he used in a bid to work out who he is . Experts have also called attention to the high level of production in ISIS videos, which use multiple cameras and professional microphones. The militant who appears in the David Haines beheading video appears similar to the man who featured in recent clips of US hostages being murdered, a security expert has said. Raffaello Pantucci, senior research fellow at defence think-tank the Royal United Services Institute, said there were numerous similarities in the films showing the killings of British aid worker Mr Haines and Americans James Foley and Steven Sotloff. All three open with a media clip of the leader of the hostage's home country - Barack Obama in the first two and David Cameron in the video featuring Mr Haines - before the captive reads what appears to be a prepared message. In each video the militant is dressed in a similar all-black outfit with only his eyes visible, while all three hostages are seen kneeling in orange boiler suits in what appears to be a desert location. He speaks with what appears to be a British accent. The apparent killer stands to the left in all of the videos and holds a knife in his left hand. Mr Pantucci said: ‘They are posed in a very similar way, opening with a message from Obama or Cameron. Then there is the similarity of having the hostage make a false statement to the camera.’ He said he was ‘pretty sure’ the same Islamic State fighter appeared in all three videos. ‘The voice sounds the same,’ he said. ‘He is clearly dressed in the same manner and his stature looks the same. It looks like the same figure. They are clearly setting this person up to be a figure.’ These are in contrast to the grainy, low-definition videos of other terror groups. It is understood that hundreds of British Special Forces and intelligence-gathering personnel are currently working in the region in an effort to capture Jihadi John. The operation also involves liaison with Kurdish and Iraqi soldiers. They are using an array of sophisticated equipment to track him down and free other hostages. Jihadi John is believed to have travelled to the war-torn country from London over a year ago after becoming radicalised and raising money for the jihadists whilst in Britain. US authorities believed they had worked out the fighter's position shortly before the first video - showing US journalist James Foley's execution - was released on September 2. However, the militants had moved on from the camp shortly before American commandoes arrived at the scene. Security forces drew up a shortlist of possible extremists who could be the murderer after Mr Foley was killed. Experts then used high-tech analysis of the man in the video's body and voice to try and narrow down the potential suspects. Britain's Ambassador to the U.S. Peter Westmacott has told CNN that security services in Britain and the US are pumping huge resources into finding out who he is and where he is hiding. He said: 'We're putting a lot into it. And there are some very sophisticated technologies, voice identification and so on, which people can use to check who these people are.' The masked man, who speaks with a clear London accent, has appeared in two chilling videos showing him beheading American journalists and issuing threats to President Obama. The videos have been filmed in barren desert, but experts have gleamed some clues to the group's location . The same killer is thought to have appeared in the first two films - in which James Foley and Steven Sotloff (pictured) were killed, and authorities will now analyse the latest video in a bid to find further clues . He was at first suspected to be Abdel-Majed Abdel Bary, the so-called 'hip hop jihadist' who left his £1million home in Maida Vale to join Islamist militants fighting for the ISIS in Syria. However, earlier this month, officials appeared to rule out Abdel Bary as the killer and focused their attention on another man, whose name has not yet been released. They are reportedly confident they have worked out the fighter's identity using high-tech analysis of his body and voice and do not believe it to be Abdel Bary. European hostages freed earlier this year have identified the man as being one of three jailers they dubbed 'The Beatles', who guarded them and oversaw torture and mock executions. The militants are thought to be in northern Syria, hiding in the swathe of the Middle East now under ISIS control . During extensive 'debriefings' with intelligence officers, the hostages were shown pictures of suspected UK and other European jihadists. The former captives are understood to have been able to recognise around eight Britons they had 'come into contact' with during their months of captivity in a dozen locations around Syria. The Daily Mirror reported earlier this week that MI5 had identified a prime suspect and was on the verge of arresting known associates still believed to be in the UK. The latest video of Mr Haines' execution will however raise fears that - despite two weeks having passed since the first execution video was released - the killer still appears to be able to carry out further killings.","US forces carried out raid on terrorists' camp before first hostage was killed .

"The Lockerbie bomber’s release was linked to a £400million arms deal with Libya, secret documents reveal. They show ‘reprehensible’ connections between the Labour government boosting business and freeing the man convicted of Britain’s worst terrorist atrocity. An email sent by the then UK ambassador in Tripoli to former premier Tony Blair explained how a prisoner transfer agreement will be signed once Libya ‘fulfils its promise’ to buy an air defence system. Handshake: Tony Blair, pictured with Colonel Gaddafi in Tripoli, met the dictator six times after he resigned as Prime Minister . The disclosure, obtained under Freedom of Information laws, reignites a row which is hugely embarrassing for Labour. At the time of Abdelbaset Al Megrahi’s release in August 2009, then prime minister Gordon Brown and his senior ministers insisted there was no link to ‘blood money’ trade deals with Colonel Gaddafi. Megrahi, a Libyan, was convicted of killing 270 people by blowing up an American airliner over Lockerbie in December 1988. He was sent home early from a Scottish jail on compassionate grounds because he had terminal prostate cancer. He died last year. Ministers insisted his release was a decision taken solely by the Scottish government. The email was sent by Sir Vincent Fean, then the UK’s top diplomat in Libya, to Mr Blair, ahead of his visit to Gaddafi in June 2008. It updated Mr Blair, who quit Downing Street a year earlier, on the UK’s ongoing relations with the brutal dictator. Prior to this, Mr Blair met Gaddafi and his prime minister Al-Baghdadi Ali al-Mahmoudi in Sirte in a desert tent. The pair thrashed out a memorandum of understanding on prisoner transfers just before BP announced the firm was investing about £545million to search for £13billion of oil in Libya. But according to the email, Mr Blair and Baghdadi agreed Libya would buy a missile defence system from MBDA, part-owned by BAE Systems. When he returned in June 2008 the Government appeared to see a chance for him to push for the arms deal to be sealed. Release: Lockerbie bomber al-Megrahi was released from prison in 2009 with only 'weeks to live'. He died almost three years later . Sir Vincent wrote: ‘There is one bilateral issue which I hope TB [Tony Blair] can raise, as a legacy issue. On 29 May 07 in Sirte, he and Libya’s PM agreed that Libya would buy an air defence system (Jernas) from the UK (MBDA). ‘One year on, MBDA are now back in Tripoli aiming to agree and sign the contract now — worth £400million, and up to 2,000 jobs in the UK. We think we have Col Q’s [Gaddafi’s] goodwill for this contract. This issue can also be raised with Libya’s PM. It was PM Baghdadi who told the media on 29 May 07 that Libya would buy British. ‘Linked (by Libya) is the issue of the 4 bilateral justice agreements about which TB signed an MoU with Baghdadi on 29 May. The MoU says they will be negotiated within the year: they have been. Atrocity: 270 people died when Pam Am flight 103 exploded over Lockerbie, in Scotland on December 21, 1988, in the worst terror attack ever seen on British soil . They are all ready for signature in London as soon as Libya fulfils its promise on Jernas.’ The prisoner transfer agreement was signed in November 2008. Susan Cohen, whose daughter Theo, 20, was among those killed at Lockerbie, said: ‘These revelations simply serve to increase the awful stench that still surrounds the whole scandal. They turned human tragedy into a business transaction. It’s absolutely reprehensible.’ Lord Mandelson, Business Secretary at the time of Megrahi’s release, said then that it was ‘offensive’ to suggest it was linked to improving commercial relations with Libya. He said yesterday: ‘I was not aware of the correspondence covered in this FOI request.’ Mr Blair’s spokesman said the email did not show ‘the UK government was trying to link the defence deal and Megrahi’. He said: ‘Actually it shows the opposite – that any linkage was from the Libyan side. As far as we’re aware there was no linkage on the UK side. What the email in fact shows is that, consistent with what we have always said, it was made clear to the then Libyan leader that the release of Megrahi was a matter for Scotland. Of course the Libyans, as they always did, raised Megrahi.’ MBDA said yesterday the Libyans never signed the arms deal.

"He's known as the 'King of Collagen', the 'Baron of Botox' and Dr Frederic Brandt uses more of both than any other dermatologist on the planet. But Brandt isn't just about the injectables. He made a name for himself in the beauty naturals world by pioneering the use of green tea in skincare, and has his own beauty range (boasting products with names like 'Crease Release') to prove it. Still, it's his cosmetic work and the invention of what has been dubbed the 'New New Face' that has brought hundreds of women in pursuit of eternal youthfulness to his door - A-list celebrities among them. The Botox Baron: Dr Frederic Brandt pioneered the use of injectables, and also green tea . Although Brandt is evangelical about the anti-ageing power of green tea, he's no slouch when it comes to using injectables on himself, and controversially, argues that cosmoceuticals should be used to prevent wrinkles as well as deal with them once they appear. 'As far as procedures go, [you should start considering them] in your mid to late 30’s,' he says. 'In terms of prevention, it is never too early to begin cosmetic procedures and treatment.' One of the first to use fillers and Botox, Brandt, who first set up shop in 1982, was instrumental in getting the substances approved for cosmetic use in the USA. Initially billed as an alternative to surgical cosmetic procedures, injectables have since become an industry in their own right, with spending on them going up by a staggering 784 per cent in the last decade alone. So was he expecting Botox to be such a success? 'I did,' he replies, enthusiasm in his voice. 'I saw its potential when I first started using it. 'I . marbled the results upon initial use and knew it was going to be one of . the most innovative, influential procedures to be performed. Not that Brandt is resting on his . laurels. Despite his love for the wrinkle-freezer, he's casting around for something new, despite not being totally convinced by the results he's had thus far. Ideal: Devotees of the New New Face want the radiant youthful looks of Demi Moore (left) and Madonna . New: Dr Brandt's new CC cream launches in the UK next month exclusively at feelunique.com . 'The newest form of botox to be approved . in the U.S. is Xeomin which has a lower amount of protein mixed in with . the toxin,' he muses. 'It remains to be seen whether it differs substantially from . the presently available forms.' Whether Botox or Xeomin, the reason for the success of Brandt and his 'New New Face' is the result. Unlike traditional cosmetic surgery, 'New, New Face' treatments should leave you looking fresh-faced, radiant and recognisable, albeit considerably younger. So at what point should you start? According to Brandt, although treatment for preventing wrinkles can never begin too soon, you need to wait until you actually have some before bringing out the big guns. 'If you have no lines, you are too young,' he says. 'I . feel that there is no ""right age"" to start considering Botox as it is . based more on a patient’s biological age rather than their . chronological age. 'For example there are women in their 20’s with a lot . of sun damage who are showing signs of aging who might be a candidate . for it when at the same time there are women in their 40’s who do not . have fine lines or wrinkles yet. He's also wary of overdoing it and is rumoured to have turned actress Demi Moore away when she asked for more Botox than he deemed necessary. 'It definitely is possible to have too much Botox,' he reveals. 'If you use too much, you can create a very unnatural look, . and you can also create a heavy brow effect if you over-botox the . forehead.' How about women who want to avoid injectables altogether? What should they be doing? Once again Dr Brandt has some advice. 'The most important thing is to apply sunscreen every day - minimum of SPF30, come rain or shine,' he says. 'Try to avoid the sun whenever possible. A teaspoon of sunscreen should be used for the face, and an additional teaspoon should be used for each arm. 'Sunscreen should be re-applied when you are exposed to the sun for prolonged periods of time. Apply peptide cream at night and antioxidant cream daily,' he continues. 'Exfoliate the skin once or twice a week, depending on skin type and lastly, apply eye cream morning and night.' Dr. Brandt’s new CC mat beauty balm, £34, launches next month and will be available exclusively at feelunique.com . Big business: The use of cosmetic fillers and Botox has increased by 734 per cent over the last decade . From a super-smooth forehead to gently plumped lips and a fresh-faced glow, Brandt's New New Face is all about looking like you, only better and younger. Demi Moore and Madonna, both of whom look like improved versions of their younger selves, are the ideal. Forehead: Smooth and wrinkle-free, usually achieved with the help of Botox injections . Eyes: Wide and Bambi-like with no deep creases in between. This can be created by injecting filler into the lower eyelids. Nose: Straight and feminine. The Duchess of Cambridge's nose is currently the most requested model. Lips: Full and slightly turned up, although not too much: trout pouts are definitely out . Cheeks: Plump and youthful. This is created by injecting filler just below the cheekbone, which adds anti-ageing volume.","Dr Frederic Brandt first started working on cosmetic jabs in the 1990s .
Today he uses more Botox and filler than any other dermatologist .
He also researched green tea benefits and uses it in his beauty range ."
"Fantasist: Academics have compiled over 700 of Himmler's letters and photographs . Heinrich Himmler - S.S. chief and organiser of the Holocaust of six million Jews - has been exposed as an insecure romantic fantasist who kept the secret of the mass Jewish extermination programme he directed from his wife and mistress in case it upset them. Academics in Germany have spent the last three years examining the letters, photos, memorandums - even a recipe book - of the most feared man in Nazi Germany after they were discovered in Israel. Himmler, who as S.S. Reichsfuehrer was in charge of the entire complex of concentration camps throughout Europe and oversaw the systematic murder of around six million Jews during the Second World War. But in the letters and diaries being serialised by Germany’s Die Welt newspaper he comes across as a foppish, even diffident accomplice to mass slaughter. In all, the SS commander sent some 700 letters to his wife, Marga. many evoking the 'banality of evil’ famously ascribed to his murderous SS lieutenant Adolph Eichmann, who organised the transportation of Jews to gas chambers. On the eve of Operation Barbarossa, the invasion of the Soviet Unon in June 1941, one of the letters Himmler wrote to his wife Marga said: 'Now it is war again. I knew it - I slept so badly.' Collection: A trove of letters, notes and photos that were in possession of an Israeli family. The letters are believed to be written by Nazi SS leader Heinrich Himmler and had not been shown to the public . Marga wrote back; 'There is a box of caviar in the fridge. Take that with you.' Twenty seven million Russians and millions more German soldiers were to die in the campaign that the Third Reich launched on June 22 that year. Himmler, who was in charge of the entire complex of concentration camps throughout Europe, wrote to Marga on July 7, 15 days after the invasion had begun, apologising for missing his wedding anniversary. 'I am so sorry I missed our anniversary for the first time', he wrote four days after the event. 'There was lots going on in these days. The fighting is very hard for the S.S.' Not that Himmler was anywhere near the frontline - the letter was sent from his holiday home in Bavaria. Historians have spent three years studying the archive, which belonged to a Jewish man before it was sealed in a bank vault in Tel Aviv, in order to test its authenticity, before coming to the conclusion that it is genuine. In an editorial Die Welt writes: 'At . first glance Himmler’s letters, especially his early ones, to his wife . revolve around mundane things. 'But they say much about the world of . ideas and the self-image of an apparently unfeeling, self-righteous . bureaucrat who became the pioneer and chief organizer of humanity’s . greatest crime - the Holocaust.' Himmler is seen here with his daughter, Gudrun . Himmler, who was in charge of the entire complex of concentration camps throughout Europe, is seen here inspecting a Russian prisoner of war . The newspaper adds: 'There was ´no word . about the countless crimes in which he was involved as Reichsführer SS, . or that he had arranged. 'Not a word about the persecution, deprivation . of rights and murder of approximately six million European Jews. And . barely a word about the ghettos guarded by his SS and his police, and . the death camps, which he also attended. Family: Heinrich Himmler in Valepp, Bavaria, with his wife Marga (back right) his daughter Gudrun (front centre), his son Gerhard (front right), and a friend of Gudrun (front left) ''I'm going to Auschwitz. Kisses, your Heini'. That was all what the closest advisor to Hitler wrote.' The Himmler correspondence was taken from his home at Gmund on the shores of Lake Tegernsee in Bavaria in 1945 as he went on the run. He had taken the identity of a lowly serviceman, shaved off his moustache and went walking across Germany before he was caught by a British patrol in May 1945. He committed suicide with a phial of cyanide hidden in his mouth before he could be questioned. Himmler met his future wife, Margarethe Siegroth, seven years his senior, on a train in September 1927 where, according to Die Welt, he displayed his 'anti-Semitism' on a trip from Berchtesgaden to Munich. From Christmas that year they were a partnership. Later she would write to him: 'I am so . happy to have a good bad man that loves his evil wife!' The academics . who authenticated the correspondence for Die Welt said that he often . referred to himself as a 'beast' and a 'wild man' in his letters to . Marga that fuelled the sexual fantasies of them both. 'My black soul thinks of only the most impossible things,' she wrote to him in 1928. He . refers to her often in the letters as 'beloved, golden woman,' and . describes himself as a 'good and wild Landsknecht' - a class of . mercenary soldier in Germany in the 16th and 17th centuries. They . traded insults about the Jews in letters before the war, and in one . Marga wrote: 'The Jew pack has much dread of you.'  In another. 'The Jew . remains the Jew!' Himmler . wrote back to her on June 21 1928; 'Don’t get angry about the Jews, . good woman, I can help you.' The previous year he wrote: 'I like Berlin . today because you are there, just like I would like the small poor . village where you came from if you were still there.' As head of the SS,  Himmler was one of the most feared men in Nazi Germany.  He was widely considered to be one of Adolf Hitler's key henchman during the Second World War . The young couple shared not only common . distaste for Jews. Also, the Imperial capital Berlin, where Marga . managed small private sanatorium at the beginning of their relationship, . not particularly good came away. 'Berlin is today like me because you . live there, just like me the poor small village would love if it were . your home', Himmler wrote on Christmas day 1927 at his girlfriend. 'The . system of Berlin, that does not treat well a good and pure woman like . you, I hate, and will always hate.' Historians spent three years studying the archive, which once belonged to a Jewish man . Himmler addressed his letters to his 'small, sweet, beloved wife' and later 'Beloved mummy.' But in 1938 he began a long term affair with his secretary Hedwig Potthast and fathered daughters Helge and Nanette-Dorothea with her. He called her 'My dear love' and the letters show he assauaged his guilt with his wife by sending her enormous food parcels later in the war from the conquered lands. The archive also reveals letters from Himmler’s and Marga’s daughter Gudrun, now living as an 85-year-old pensioner in Munich who assists still-surviving wanted Nazis to keep out of the claws of justice through the sinister Stille Hilfe - Silent Aid - organisation. On the actual day of the invasion of the Soviet Union the 13-year-old Gudrun wrote to him with a presience the regime’s hierachy did not possess: 'It's awful that we make war against Russia. They were our allies. Russia is soooo big.  When we take over the whole of Russia the fight will be very difficult.' The serialisation begins ahead of World Holocaust Memorial Day on Monday, which marks the date in January 1945 when the major Nazi slaughterhouse of Auschwitz was liberated by the Red Army. Commenting on the publication, Karen Pollock, Chief Executive of the Holocaust Educational Trust, said: 'The Nazis were not ""monsters"" but people who committed monstrous acts. 'As these photos and letters show, Heinrich Himmler was a family man - which makes the choices he made elsewhere in his life all the more shocking and incomprehensible.'","Academics have compiled over 700 of Himmler's letters and photographs .

"Sainsbury's customers today pledged to shop elsewhere after it halved the value of its Nectar points. Britain's third biggest supermarket chain says customers will only receive one loyalty point for every pound spent - rather than two as it is now - from next year.

They say shoppers will still get similar amounts of Nectar rewards because of regular 'bonus events'. Scroll down for video . Anger: Sainsbury's customers are upset after they halved the value of its popular Nectar points . This month Sainsbury's suffered a slump in quarterly sales, which pushed the retailer's shares to a six-year low. Now it faces a further backlash from customers angry it has reduced Nectar points from April 11, 2015. Chris Whitehead wrote on Twitter: 'Hey @sainsburys if I enter into a relationship with an agreed expectation of loyalty, then you change it, expect divorce. Hi @Ocado £Nectar' Another said: 'Shocking that @sainsburys is cutting the value of nectar points in half! They're already hard enough to accumulate.' Bosses have also scrapped points for customers who reuse plastic bags - but say they will offer promotions including 5p off every litre of fuel for a month. Another promotion will see shoppers win more points by swiping their card in store. Anna McNally said: 'So @sainsburys will no longer be giving me nectar points for reusing my bags but will be giving out extra points on fuel. Sounds very green.' And Emma Gibbs said: 'Disappointing that @sainsburys has dropped Nectar points for those reusing carrier bags. Should be incentivising people to £recycle.' Millions of people are members of the Nectar card scheme, which was launched in 2002. Popular: Millions of Britons haver a Nectar card in their wallet or purse . Customers currently enjoy a number of perks, including double Nectar points on all Sainsbury’s shopping – online and in store – and two Nectar points per £1 spent on Sainsbury's fuel - plus one point per litre when the customer also swipes their Nectar. A spokesman for Sainsbury's said: 'We are changing the way customers earn Nectar points and launching more high-value bonus events, like Swipe to Win, 10xpoints on fuel and adding more categories to our Christmas 'Double Up' event so that customers can make their points go even further.' It claims that the extra point usually given to customers will be handed back through various initiatives. The  giant  faced further embarrassment last month after a poster urging staff to encourage customers to spend an additional 50p in the supermarket was accidentally placed on the front window of a store.

"Lionel Messi found himself at the centre of a World Cup storm on Monday as Argentine hero Diego Maradona and FIFA boss Sepp Blatter both registered their shock that he had been voted the outstanding player of the tournament. Messi seemed a little sheepish, perhaps embarrassed to be told after Argentina had lost Sunday’s final to Germany in extra-time that he would be expected to trudge up the steps at the Maracana Stadium to collect his Golden Ball trophy from the presentation balcony. Perhaps he was simply worn out, or perhaps he too felt there were more deserving candidates, such as any number of the triumphant German team, Holland’s dashing winger Arjen Robben or Colombia’s six-goal playmaker James Rodriguez, who won the Golden Boot for finishing as top scorer, and who got Maradona’s personal vote.

What could have been: Messi uncharacteristically missed good chances to win the Cup for his country . Gracious: Messi stops for a photo with Germany's World Cup-winning goal scorer Mario Gotze . It was FIFA’s technical study group who chose Messi but a conspiracy theory was soon established that it might be the muscle of sportswear manufacturer adidas who sponsored the Golden Ball award and who might want Messi to win it because he is the global face of their brand. ‘I would give heaven and earth to Leo but when marketing people want him to win something he didn’t (deserve to) win, it is unfair,’ said Maradona, who claimed the same award when Argentina won the World Cup in 1986. ‘I could see that he didn’t want to go up and collect it.’ By his own incredibly high standards Messi did not have the best of seasons in Spain, where his rhythm was hit by injuries but he started the World Cup in Brazil in great touch. There were wonderful solo goals against Bosnia and Herzegovina and Iran in the group stage. He struck twice against Nigeria, including one of his trademark curling free-kicks, as Argentina won Group F with a maximum nine points but he was unable to transfer this prolific form into the knock-out rounds.

Without his moments of magic, Argentina’s goal-flow seized up. They scored only twice in four knock-out ties, even though three of the games went into extra-time. Messi seemed to fade, looked increasingly tired and was unable to find the net again. He was on target with his penalty in the shoot-out against the Dutch after their semi-final in Sao Paulo had remained goalless through extra-time but his performance in the final against Germany was subdued and he missed one of the Argentina’s clearest chances. ‘I was a bit surprised when I saw Messi getting the best player of the tournament,’ said FIFA president Blatter. ‘If you compare the beginning of the tournament and why the team of Argentina got to the final then look at the decisive goals he scored.’","Messi won the award for the World Cup's most outstanding player .

"A mother who lived at a squalid  home where the bodies of three infants were found has been ordered held without bail. Not guilty pleas were entered on Friday on behalf of 31-year-old Erika Murray on charges including fetal death concealment and witness intimidation. She isn't charged in the deaths. Meanwhile, the search continued for more possible bodies at the filty, vermin-infested home in Blackstone, Massachusetts where four other children previously were removed into state custody. The two youngest children have been also receiving medical treatment after showing signs of long-term neglect. Scroll down for video . Erika Murray, 31, who is believed to be the mother of all seven children, was arraigned on Friday for charges relating to the foul living conditions, however no criminal charges have been filed in connection with the deaths of the three babies found at the Massachusetts home . Murray's attorney said that her client is mentally ill. A not guilty plea was entered on her behalf today during her arraignment at Uxbridge District Court . Neither child has birth records. The three-year-old cannot walk, has poor muscle tone and only makes a few sounds, the Boston Globe reported. A six-month-old baby is extremely sensitive to sunlight. The father of the children apparently did not know he had two younger children, according to investigators. Ms Murray appeared disheveled as she was arraigned in Uxbridge District Court on Friday morning. The judge agreed to a request by a prosecutor to seal a file concerning a previous court appearance on reckless endangerment charges related to the two youngest of the four children taken from the home last month. Murray's lawyer, Keith Halpern, pointing to the conditions in the home, suggested that his client was mentally ill. She was held without bail, NECN reported and is due back in court on October 14. Detectives investigating a case of reckless endangerment of children found the bodies on Thursday at the house in Blackstone, about 50 miles southwest of Boston along the Rhode Island border. Four other children had been removed from the home two weeks earlier. Erika Murray, 31, who is believed to be the mother of all seven children, was arrested on charges relating to the foul living conditions, however no criminal charges have been filed in connection with the deaths. Worcester District Attorney Joseph Early Jr. said the house was in 'deplorable condition.' He said authorities don't know when or how the babies died, or their ages and genders. The body of one infant was found inside a closet, police said. The two other babies were found on Thursday. Murray is led out of the district court in Uxbridge, Massachusetts following her arraignment on Friday. She is being held without bail and is due back in court on October 14 . The infants were found dead inside the home in Blackstone, Massachusetts on Thursday where four children were removed by authorities last month . Prosecutors said Murray, 31, would be arraigned on Friday on charges including intimidation of a witness. It was not immediately known whether she had an attorney. A spokesman for the Blackstone Police Chief  told the Boston Globe today that Murray is believed to be the mother of all seven children. The search of the home, which is just a couple hundred feet away from the town's police station, is expected to take several days. The four other children, ages 13, ten, three and six months old, were removed from the house on August 28 after a neighbor notified police about their living conditions. The prosecutor said one of them approached a neighbor about a child who wouldn't stop crying. Early said the six-month-old was found covered with feces lying on a bed. Both 'condemned' and 'keep out' signs are attached behind police tape to the front door of a house where a Massachusetts prosecutor said the bodies of three infants were found Thursday in Blackstone . Emergency personal in protective clothing fold a tarp on the street in front of a house where a Massachusetts prosecutor said the bodies of three infants were found . Investigators working in the small house were wearing hazardous material suits. 'The house is filled with vermin,' the prosecutor said. 'We have flies. We have bugs. We have used diapers, in some areas, as much as a foot-and-a-half to 2-feet high.' Marilynn Soucy, 68, who lives a few doors down, said she was still in shock at the news in the neighborhood where she has lived for 35 years. 'I am so disgusted. It hasn't really registered in my head yet,' she said. 'My husband and I raised seven children. We have 11 grandchildren and two great grandchildren. I cannot imagine hurting a child.' She said she and her husband, Bob, had rarely seen the couple who lived in the house for at least three years, or their children. She said they occasionally saw the 10-year-old, a boy, playing outside or the woman sit on her porch. Soucy said she never heard any major complaints about the couple, other than her grandkids noted once that the house smelled bad. Police investigators work outside a home after they discovered the remains of three infants inside a home filled with bugs and trash including dirty diapers piled several feet high, in Blackstone, Massachusetts . An official described the interior of the home crawling with vermin, swarming with flies and covered in dirty diapers . The house, Soucy said, had been renovated extensively before they moved in. 'If we thought kids were being abused or living in squalor we would have said something,' she said. Soucy said the only time there was commotion at the house was when officials removed the children. The state Department of Children and Families said in a statement Thursday that the children who were living at the home are in state custody. It said the department did not have a case involving the family and that it learned about the situation through a report of possible abuse or neglect. Early said it's too soon to know if charges will be filed in the infants' deaths, or against whom, because investigators don't even know who was living at the home when they died. It wasn't immediately clear where the children's parents were. Officers on the scene have found swarms of flies, bugs, vermin and 'piles of used diapers as much as a foot or two high'. Four other children, aged six months, three, ten and 13 years old, were removed from the house last month after a neighbor who discovered their living conditions notified police. He said the six-month-old baby was found covered in feces lying on a bed. The State Department of Children and Families said on Thursday that the children who were living at the home are now in state custody. On Thursday, 31-year-old Erika Murray was arrested in connection with the appalling living condition but not over the children's deaths. Murray is facing several charges, including witness intimidation. She will be arraigned on Friday.","Not guilty pleas were entered today on behalf of 31-year-old Erika Murray on charges including fetal death concealment and witness intimidation .

"The real bomber? Mohammed Abu Talb has been named as a likely suspect in the Lockerbie bombing . For 25 years, the Lockerbie Bombing has been shrouded in mystery. Now, an Eyptian terrorist has been revealed as a likely suspect in the devastating attack. Mohammed Abu Talb - who is serving life in prison for a series of bombings - has been named in a private investigation called Operation Bird. He is alleged to be behind the blast that took place on board Pan Am Flight 103 over Scotland in 1988 - killing 270 people. The investigation - put forward as a report by Forensic Investigative Associates in London - has also accused the CIA of covering up Talb's role in the atrocity, according the The Sunday People and Exaro. It was commissioned by lawyers for Libyan Abdelbaset al-Megrahi, who was jailed in 2001 for masterminding the bombing. If the report is correct, it means al-Megrahi - who died of cancer aged 60 last year after being controversially freed from jail in 2009 - may have been wrongly imprisoned. Investigators claim key pieces of . evidence in the case against al-Megrahi - including a fragment of . circuit board for a timer - were faked. They . also allege the bomb was planted in luggage at Heathrow airport in . London - not loaded by al-Megrahi in Malta, as the prosecution . claimed during his trial in 2001. And . they say Talb - who was an initial suspect in the case - met with other . Middle East terror suspects in the run-up to the bombing. The report - written in 2002 - was supposed to form part of al-Megrahi's appeal in 2009, but it was never used. Horrific: Pan Am Flight 103 exploded over Lockerbie, Scotland, on December 22, 1988 - killing 270 people . Wreckage: Eleven people in the Scottish town were killed when parts of the plane plummeted to the ground . Jailed: Libyan Abdelbaset al-Megrahi, pictured left and right, was jailed in 2001 for masterminding the bombing . However, it is due to be aired in an Al Jazeera TV documentary this week. Its authors - Jessica de Grazia, a . former New York chief assistant district attorney, and ex-Met police . officer Philip Corbett - expect their findings to provoke calls for the case to be re-opened. They conclude: 'We have never seen a criminal . investigation in which there has been such a consistent disregard of an . alternative and far more persuasive theory of the case.' Talb, . now 59, was jailed for life in 1989 after carrying out bombings in . Copenhagen, Denmark and Amsterdam - killing one person and reportedly . injuring a further 20. Cover-up? The private investigation has accused the CIA of covering up Talb's role in the terrorist atrocity . He has always denied any involvement in the Lockerbie bombing - and even gave evidence against al-Megrahi during his trial in return for immunity from prosecution. However, ex-CIA expert Robert Baer later claimed the terrorist had been paid $500,000 (£307,000) just months after the atrocity. And Operation Bird suggests police were misled in . their investigation due to a government agency - most likely, the CIA - . deliberately covering up the true culprit. Ms . De Grazia and Mr Corbett said the five-month inquiry 'leads us to . believe the investigation into the Lockerbie bombing was directed . off-course as a result of government interference.' Denial: Talb, now 59, has always denied any involvement in the attack over Lockerbie (pictured) in Dumfries . They added: 'In our experience, the decision to intervene would have been made at the highest level of government, most likely a top executive of the United States Central Intelligence Agency.' Earlier this year, members of the Lockerbie investigation . team - including officers from Dumfries and Galloway Police - visited Libya to look into possible leads which could result in further convictions for the bombing. However, Libyan authorities later said they did not want to 'dig into the past' amid . fears they could be forced to pay out further compensation to the . families of the victims. Tragic: The Daily Mail's front page following the Lockerbie bombing on December 22, 1988 . The Lockerbie bombing remains the worst terrorist attack to have been committed in the UK. On December 21, 1988, Pan Am Flight 103 exploded over the Scottish town of Lockerbie as it flew to New York from London.All 243 passengers and 16 crew members were killed - while a further 11 on the ground below also died. Some of the victims' bodies were never found. In November 1991, murder warrants were issued for two Libyan nationals - Libyan agent Abdelbasetal-Megrahi and Libyan Arab Airlines station manager Lamin Khalifah Fhimah. However, al-Megrahi was the only person found guilty of murder. He was controversially freed from a Scottish jail in 2009 on compassionate grounds because he had been diagnosed with terminal prostate cancer. He died in Libya aged 60 last year. Ministers insisted al-Megrahi's early release was a decision taken solely by the Scottish government. But documents later came to light showing that the Labour party secretly helped free Megrahi to appease Colonel Gaddafi, who was threatening to scupper oil contracts and unleash ‘holy war’ on Britain.","Egyptian terrorist Mohammed Abu Talb named as likely suspect in bombing .

"Patrick Rock, a key advisor to the Prime Minister, has been arrested on suspicion of child porn offences . One of David Cameron's closest aides has resigned after being arrested on child pornography allegations. Patrick Rock has been closely involved in drawing up Government policy on internet porn filters. He quit after the Prime Minister learned he was at the centre of a police probe over images of child abuse. Detectives from the National Crime . Agency searched No 10 and examined IT systems and offices used by Mr . Rock, deputy director of the Downing Street policy unit. Mr . Rock was a protege of Margaret Thatcher and has held a series of senior . posts in the Conservative Party. He has been close to Mr Cameron for . many years. Described as . the Prime Minister's 'policy fixer', the unmarried 62-year-old had been . tipped as a leading contender for a Conservative peerage only weeks ago. His . arrest and resignation from Downing Street, where he has worked since . 2011, will send shockwaves through the party's high command. The Prime . Minister is said to be 'extremely shocked'. A friend said: 'He has known Patrick for a long time and never expected anything like this.' Mr . Rock was arrested last month after officials at No 10 were made aware . of a 'potential offence relating to child abuse imagery', Mr Cameron's . spokesman told the Daily Mail. One well-placed source said Mr Rock . had also been the subject of a sexual harassment complaint from a civil . servant working in Downing Street, which is understood to have been . passed to Mr Cameron's chief of staff Ed Llewellyn. 'There . were accusations against him that didn't turn into a formal process. That has upset some people at No 10,' the source said. Mr Cameron's relationship with Mr Rock goes back to the Home Office, where they both worked under Michael Howard in the 1990s. Mr . Rock, who has repeatedly tried to become an MP, is known in Westminster . for coining the phrase 'Cows moo, dogs bark, Labour puts up taxes' used . by the Tories in the 1970s. The Prime Minister brought him back . into Downing Street in 2011, a move welcomed by critics as heralding the . return of a 'grown up' to the centre of government. In . the No 10 policy unit, he has taken a particular responsibility for . home affairs issues and has also been involved in drawing up the . Government's measures against internet pornography and child abuse . imagery. Close aide arrested: Prime Minister David Cameron leaves 10 Downing Street . Prime Minister David Cameron and his chief of staff Ed Llewellyn (standing), who was made aware of a sexual harassment complaint filed against Mr Rock . Google and other search engines introduced changes that will prevent depraved images from being listed in results for more than 100,000 searches after Government pressure . In a crusade . spearheaded by the Prime Minister, Downing Street brokered a deal with . internet firms which means that all 20million households connected to . the internet are being contacted and asked whether they want . family-friendly filters installed. Downing Street also persuaded Google and other search engines to introduce changes that will prevent depraved images from being listed in results for more than 100,000 searches. Downing Street confirmed that Mr Rock, who lives in West London, had been involved in the policy. 'The Prime Minister believes that child . abuse imagery is abhorrent and that anyone involved with it should be . properly dealt with under the law.' Downing Street spokesman . 'Patrick . Rock was one of a number of advisers and officials involved in dealing . with this issue – but the work was led by somebody else, and decisions . were taken by ministers,' a spokesman said. 'On the evening of February 12, Downing Street was first made aware of a potential offence relating to child abuse imagery. It was immediately referred to the National Crime Agency. 'The Prime Minister was immediately informed and kept updated throughout. Patrick Rock was arrested at his home in the early hours of February 13, a few hours after Downing Street had reported the matter. 'Subsequently, we arranged for officers to come into No 10 and have access to all IT systems and offices they considered relevant. 'This is an ongoing investigation so it would not be appropriate to comment further, but the Prime Minister believes that child abuse imagery is abhorrent and that anyone involved with it should be properly dealt with under the law.' The spokesman denied suggestions that colleagues in No 10 had been told Mr Rock was 'off sick', but only the Prime Minister and a handful of his most senior officials appear to have been told the reason for his absence. Downing Street refused to comment on the allegation of sexual harassment, but insisted: 'All complaints are dealt with very seriously and are dealt with appropriately.' Oxford-educated Patrick Rock comes from a noble background . By . Tom Kelly and James Chapman . Born Patrick Robert John Rock de . Besombes to a family of European aristocrats, he has worked for leading . Tories for four decades. But . despite his impeccable social and political contacts, Oxford-educated . Rock has repeatedly failed in his ambition to become a Conservative MP, . despite being selected to fight safe seats. Rock, . 62 and unmarried, lives in a £500,000 flat in Parsons Green, West . London. He was born in Kensington in 1951, a year after the marriage of . his mother Gertrud and Egyptian-born father Robert John Rock de . Besombes. His paternal grandmother was a D'aigneaux, from a noble French family that originated in Normandy and boasts a coat of arms. As . a teenager, Rock boarded at the elite Jesuit Stonyhurst College in . Lancashire, winning a scholarship to Worcester College, Oxford, where he . studied history. After . graduation he worked as Margaret Thatcher's political correspondence . secretary in the then Prime Minister's Office and also as managing . director of the Retail Consortium. It . is not clear when he shortened his name to plain Patrick Rock, but he . used it while fighting the Woolwich East election in 1979, aged 28, . which he lost despite increasing the Tory vote. After . losing Crewe and Nantwich in the 1983 election he was selected in a . by-election to defend the seemingly impregnable safe seat of Portsmouth . South in 1984, which had a Tory majority of over 12,000. The . Portsmouth News described him as 'Mrs Thatcher's protege' who had been . hand-picked by Downing Street to contest the seat ahead of more . impressive local candidates. During . the campaign he was described as 'likeable and energetic but slightly . wet behind the ears'. His campaign went catastrophically wrong after he . spoke on TV about a hospital that was not in the constituency. Rock . was unconcerned, declaring at a public meeting that he was 'absolutely . certain' he would win the seat, predicting Labour would finish second . and the Liberal SDP Alliance trail in third. But . after a 14 per cent swing against him, he was defeated by the . Alliance's Mike Hancock in what was labelled the 'biggest election upset . for years' and a 'great surprise' to Mrs Thatcher. Newspaper reports described the defeated Rock leaving the count 'pale with shock'. He . blamed the defeat on too many Conservatives staying at home and Mrs . Thatcher phoned him the following morning to assure him the defeat was . not his fault. The following year, he was appointed to the Conservative . Research Department. He . later worked as special adviser to Cabinet ministers in the Department . of the Environment and then the Home Office, where he met David Cameron. The pair are famously said to have repaired to the Two Chairmen pub on . the day of the death in 1994 of Labour leader John Smith, where they . agreed Tony Blair would take over, leaving their party 'f*****'. Rock again attempted to become an MP in 1990, applying for the safe Tory seat of Devizes, but failed to be selected. He . also worked in Brussels for EU Commissioner Chris Patten, with the . responsibility for the western Balkans, before becoming a policy adviser . at Downing Street. Colleagues . describe him as 'abrasive' and 'a commentator rather an a doer'. Another said his arrest over child abuse images was a 'terrific shock'.

"For most fathers, today is about spending time with their children and enjoying the influx of gifts and cards, but for one parent, Father's Day is one he thought he would never get to celebrate at all. Kevin Byrne, from Soham in Cambridgeshire, was diagnosed with non-Hogkin's lymphoma aged four and was told at 16 that he would never be a father. Today, however, Mr Byrne, 38, is celebrating his first Father's Day as a parent after a pioneering fertility treatment led to the birth of his baby son. Kevin Byrne, centre, had been told that he would never be a father, but today he proudly shows his son Arthur, right, with wife Natalie, after he underwent pioneering fertility treatment . Now enjoying life with baby Arthur and wife Natalie, Mr Byrne says he hoped his decision to seek treatment might help others. 'He's a very special little boy,' said the overjoyed father. 'I was concerned my family line would stop with me, but now Arthur is here, he can go on to have a family of his own. 'Being a parent - something I never thought would happen for me - is simply incredible.' And it's all the more so given the hurdles Mr and Mrs Byrne have had to overcome. Although Mr Byrne's sperm was all but destroyed during treatment for cancer - leaving him infertile. 'I knew it was unlikely that I would be producing sperm but the . results still come as a blow,' he says of the moment he was given the bad news. 'I was disappointed but not surprised. 'I . felt particularly bad for Natalie, as she was more hopeful then I was . about the result and was quite upset. 'We talked about adoption but . decided we wanted to try IVF with a sperm donor first so went to our . local hospital for further fertility testing.' Although the couple were resigned to using donor sperm but experts at Bourn Hall, a fertility clinic near Cambridge, suggested they try a new procedure known as testicular sperm extraction. Kevin Byrne, right, developed non-Hodgkin's lymphoma as a four year old and was told he would never be a father as a result, however, Dr Oliver Wiseman, left, was able to use a new technique to make his dream true . There are . several methods of surgical sperm retrieval, which is used when there . are no sperm in the ejaculate - this includes removing sperm from liquid . in the epididymis where it is stored, or by extracting immature sperm . from tiny pieces of testicular tissue where it is made. Incredibly, much to their delight, an operation 18 months ago, doctors successfully found sperm, which was then frozen until the Byrnes were ready to start a family . 'I was worried Kevin might not bond with a child that wasn't his . own,' adds Mrs Byrne. 'He was realistic and stoical about the whole thing - but I was . disappointed for him.' Happily for the Byrnes, the treatment worked and baby Arthur was born by caesarian section in November last year. The couple's consultant, Oliver Wiseman, said the case illustrated how difficult men found it to confront the issue of infertility. He added: 'For many, an appointment with me is the first time they've been able to freely ask questions without embarrassment and often don't realise just how common the problems are.' Mr Wiseman said couples struggling to conceive should take an equal role investigating the causes of infertility. 'Boosting fertility with good diet and improving general health can increase the chances of natural conception,' he added. 'Couples should also consider having a semen analysis as this can identify or eliminate issues early on and determine if further medical help may be required. 'If there is a problem with the sperm count, then patients should be seen by a male fertility specialist.'","Kevin Byrne, 38, from Cambridgeshire was told he would never be a parent .

"Dodge has unveiled its most powerful car ever – the 707 horsepower Challenger SRT Hellcat. The muscle car tops the competition with a 6.2 liter V8 HEMI engine that comes in either an eight-speed automatic or a six-speed manual transmission, the car maker announced. It is being positioned against the supercharged likes of Ford’s Shelby Mustangs and Chevrolet’s Camaro ZR1 models. Scroll down for video . A monster: This is the 707 horsepower engine that powers the Hellcat . Gorgeous: The interior of the Hellcat is first class all the way . The most powerful mass produced American car ever made even comes with two sets of keys, according to Fox News. ‘One that restricts the engine to 500 hp and another that opens the gates of the Hellcat,' said Fox. Both sets are actually keyless ignition key fobs, according to CNN Money. Even with just the black key fob, the supped-up Challenger has 15 more horsepower than the next fastest model of the Challenger. ‘I thought we'd reached the point of ridiculous horsepower numbers when the Corvette ZR1 hit in 2009 with 638 horsepower,’ Karl Brauer, a senior director at the automotive Web site KBB.com, told CNN Money. ‘Clearly I was off, as the horsepower wars appear to have only just begun.’ In the dust: The 707 hp Dodge Challenger SRT leaves all other cars trailing behind . Beast: The Shelby Ford Mustang GT500 is second only to the Hellcat with its 660 horsepower . Also fast: 2014 Dodge Viper SRT has a staggering 638 horsepower, but only comes in third place . Gas mileage and pricing have not been publicly released by the automaker, but expect both to be wallet-busting. The beast will hit showroom floors in the fall. A four-door model is also expected to be released. The Dodge may be the fastest American muscle car off an assembly line, but it did have to overcome some stiff competition. The Dodge Viper SRT clocks in at 640 horsepower, and the Corvette ZR1 comes with a cool 638 horses under the hood.

"A village of just 1,000 residents in Switzerland has been forced to raise taxes because an African refugee and her seven children cost the local authority £40,000 in benefits every month. Hagenbuch, in the Swiss canton of Zurich, is understood to be spending close to a third of its total annual budget on the family after they arrived from Eritrea in East Africa three years ago. The massive benefits bill covers day-to-day living expenses such as groceries and cleaning costs, as well as paying for four of the woman's children to be housed in an orphanage and even bills for general entertainment - such as guided tours of local attractions and entry fees for the zoo. Outraged: Hagenbuch (pictured), in the Swiss canton of Zurich, is understood to be spending close to a third of its total annual budget on the family after they arrived from Eritrea in East Africa three years ago . The Eritrean woman and her family arrived in Hagenbuch three years ago in possession of a visa allowing her to stay in Switzerland for five years, with the option to extend her stay beyond that date. It is not known if the family had lived elsewhere in Switzerland before moving to the quiet village. Solely to cover the cost of the family's massive benefits bill, the local authority is now planning to raise taxes in the village by a shocking five per cent . 'I don't know where to turn. I think we have no other choice but to raise taxes,' Mayor Therese Schlaepfer told daily Swiss newspaper Blick. She added that local residents were justifiably outraged by the spiraling costs of caring for the family, who require a team of social workers to spend six hours a day, six days a week on them alone. The family arrived in Hagenbuch after spending time at a Swiss immigration centre, like the one pictured above . When the woman and her family arrived in Hagenbuch three years ago, the municipal government immediately agreed to cover the full cost of their rent and £1,700 a month in living expenses. A short time later the woman sought further financial help, claiming she had become overwhelmed by family commitments and was now struggling to look after all seven of her children. This resulted in four of them being sent to an orphanage - with the local authority paying out £6,000 for each child every month - a total cost of £24,000. £24,000 - Cost of looking after four children at the local orphanage . £13,000 - Social worker expenses . £1,700 - General living expenses allowance . £1,300 - Housing costs and entertainment bills . On top of this there are also the costs of helping the woman pay her cooking and cleaning bills - plus rolling entertainment expenses, such as paying the entry fee for all eight family members at the zoo. As well as straight handouts, the family also reportedly cost the local authority thousands more every month by tying up social workers and carers for six hours a day, six days a week. On average these social workers cost the council about £90 every hour they work, rising to £95 an hour in the evening or at weekends.","Village of Hagenbuch spends thousands every month on one refugee family .

"Dismantled: Villagers in Lower Hartshay said their Guy Fawkes night bonfire was removed and replaced with 'environmental crime scene' tape by council health and safety officials (file picture) It has been a much-loved annual fixture of village life for decades. Days before Bonfire Night locals would dump wood and grass cuttings on site ready to give the Guy his traditional send-off. But this year residents of Lower Hartshay were left to celebrate around a few fireworks and sparklers after council officials swooped to dismantle the 6ft stack claiming it amounted to ‘fly-tipping’. They said there was no licence for the event and, to emphasise the seriousness of the misdemenaour, left police-style tape marking out the ‘environmental crime scene’, along with a sign warning villagers ‘we are watching you’ and threatening a hefty fine. The gathering has taken place on the Derbyshire village’s recreation ground for more than 20 years. David Crowder, 50, said his children, George, 13, and Charley, 11, were left disappointed by the move. ‘This is an event that brings us together as a community. We have no church, no community centre and, consequently, everyone comes together for this event,’ he said. Mr Crowder said villagers had never asked the council for permission because they ‘never felt they needed to’. He added: ‘I’ve been in the village for 29 years and every year we build a bonfire. 'It’s just garden waste and hedge-cuttings.You’ve only got to look at the ground to see there’s a scorch mark.’ Scene: Villagers in Lower Hartshay had celebrated bonfire night at their recreation ground for 20 years without incident .

"Accused: Dustin Kent, 36, allegedly raped a 13-year-old relative as her father watched . The uncle of missing Alabama teenager Brittney Wood raped a 13-year-old relative as her father watched, a police detective has testified in court. Dustin Kent, who stands accused of sodomy and sexual abuse in multiple cases, is just one of Brittney's five relatives arrested on sex charges since her disappearance in May. Police say that the charges do not relate to the missing 19-year-old, who left behind her two-year-old daughter. Her uncle, Donnie Holland, shot himself with her gun just two days after she vanished. On Monday, Sgt. Scott Congleton from the Mobile police testified at a preliminary hearing in Mobile County District Court that the rape committed by Kent took place in 2008 when the girl was 13. The victim, now 17, only came forward earlier this year amid the search for Brittney and her claims were 'credible', Congleton said. He recounted her ordeal, explaining the girl's father lured her with the promise of going to a pet store to buy a hamster - but instead, they drove to Kent's workplace, the Mobile Register reported. Kent, 36, joined them in the car and they drove to a run-down industrial park as it became darker. As they were driving, the girl complained that she had a headache and Kent rubbed her head, Congleton said. He started to kiss her but she pushed him away, he added. When the car pulled over, Kent took off her clothes and performed a sex act on her before raping her as her father watched, Congleton testified. Mystery: 19-year-old Brittney Wood, pictured with her daughter, vanished in May 2012 . 'She kept telling him to stop. He did not,' the detective said. At the hearing, the judge concluded . that prosecutors had enough evidence to send the rape and sodomy charges . against Kent to a grand jury. Kent has been freed on bail but cannot contact the victim or children younger than 16. Police have downplayed any connection . between Brittney's disappearance and the charges against her . relatives. Assistant District Attorney Nicki Patterson said it remains . under investigation. Family affair: Donald Holland Sr., left, was under investigation for sex abuse when Brittney went to visit him and he shot himself two days later. His wife, Wendy, right, has been arrested for endangering a child . Cousins in crime: Their son, Donald Holland Jr. (left), was charged with raping a 12-year-old girl, while his cousin, and the brother of Brittney Wood, Derek Wood, was also charged in the same incident . The young mother vanished on May 30 after saying that she planned to visit her uncle, Donnie Holland, in Baldwin County, but she has not been seen since. Two days later, Holland shot himself in the head with what police later learned was Brittney's gun. His suicide came as he, too, was under investigation for molestation, and he killed himself just half an hour before he was being interviewed by detectives, police said. But while he escaped the investigation, five of his other relatives and one family friend have not. The five relatives are Brittney's brother, cousin, aunt and two uncles - including Kent. Most recently, her aunt and Donnie Holland's wife, 33-year-old Wendy Holland, was arrested and charged with one count of endangering the welfare of a child. 'Sick': Wendy Holland's brother, Randall Scott Wood (left), has been arrested on charges of sodomy and sexual abuse. Family friend William Brownlee (right) was charged in the incident with the 12-year-old . Wendy Holland's two young children, who are in grade school, were handed over to the Department of Human Resources after her arrest on October 17, authorities said. In a bizarre twist in the case of missing teenage mother Brittney Wood, her brother (Derek Wood), cousin (Donald Holland Jr.), aunt (Wendy Holland), and two uncles, (Dustin Kent and Randall Scott Wood), have been arrested on sex abuse charges in separate cases. Donald Holland Sr., . the husband of Wendy Holland and father of Donald Holland Jr., was also under investigation for sex abuse . when he shot himself following Brittney's disappearance. Wendy Holland and Randall Scott Wood are her mother's siblings. Dustin Kent is married to another of her mother's siblings. Her stepson, Donald Holland Jr., also stands accused of raping a 12-year-old girl in January 2011. Brittney's brother Derek Wood, 22, has been arrested for rape and sodomy, and allegedly had sex with the same 12-year-old. Another uncle - her mother's brother - Randall Scott Wood, was arrested on June 19 on charges of incest, sodomy and sexual abuse - the same day Kent and Donnie Holland Sr. were arrested. Kent is the brother-in-law of Brittney's mother; he is married to Wendy Holland's twin sister, Mendy. In addition to the family arrests, Donnie Holland's friend, William Brownlee, was arrested on July 22 for second-degree sodomy and for having sex with the 12-year-old girl. Police said they anticipate even more arrests in the sex-abuse investigation, which they carried out over three months. Where is she? Police say the disappearance of Brittney Wood, whose brother, cousin, aunt and two uncles have been arrested for different sex charges, is not related to the cases . Justice: Kent appeared at Mobile County District court on Monday and his charges will go to a grand jury . There has been no sign of Brittney since she went to her uncle's house on May 30, and at first relatives thought she might have run away. 'We as a family do not see how she had . the means to run,' her mother Chessie Wood said. 'We've covered every friend, every one of them are . accounted for,' Mrs Woods said. 'I mean if she had to run because she's that scared, I would really believe that she would have [taken] her daughter with her.' Of Donnie Holland's suicide, she said: 'It just really does not look good that she went missing May 30 and two days later he commits suicide.'","Brittney Wood, 19, vanished in May as she went to visit an uncle .

"A woman has lost nearly three stone since a hypnotist convinced her she'd had a gastric band fitted. Nichola Prichard, 45, of Sebastapol, Pontypool, said she has slimmed down from 14st 1lb to 11st 13lb since being hypnotised. She said the treatment was a far better alternative to paying thousands to go under the knife to have a real gastric band fitted. More body confident: Nichola has dropped three stone since being hynotised, left. She used to weigh 14st 1lb so covered up on the beach, right . She . said: 'I was so fed up with being overweight I was ready to go the . whole hog and pay £6,000 for a gastric band and go through all that . pain. 'I've saved all that time and pain and money going to nice relaxing hypnotherapy sessions instead.' Nichola said following hypnosis, she has transformed her eating habits. She now craves healthy food instead of sugary snacks and knows when she's had enough. She explained: 'I don't need to diet. I eat healthily, slowly and taste my food and feel full without eating so much.' Nichola said her treatment was preferable to paying out for a real gastric band as she was fed up of being a size 18-20 . Her hypnotist Simon English, 41, from Cardiff, said there's a growing appetite for his treatment. He said he talks clients through every aspect of real-life surgery during his five one-hour hypnotherapy sessions, costing £350. He said it's a 'visualisation technique' that makes people thing they really have had the op. He explains: 'I say: ""The nurse is here now, she is taking your blood pressure and they are wheeling you out on a trolley. Now you are going into the operating theatre. They are making incisions for the surgery.""' 'Then as the music fades in the background I describe them being taken into the recovery room. When it's over they feel a little tightness, that sort of thing, as if the band has been fitted, but nothing painful.' Think yourself slim: Hypnotist Simon English convinced Nichola she'd had surgery . As they would be in real life, patients are given dietary sheets and advise on how to change eating habits. They are also given a CD which helps reinforce the hypno-technique over following weeks. Simon said he allows clients to imagine their own surgeon - who could be anyone from a medic who has previously carried out a successful operation to a fictional character from Harry Potter. 'It is a question of who a person is comfortable with. You can choose anyone to be your surgeon,' said Simon, 41, who sees 20 clients a week. 'We had one lady who was into Harry Potter who chose Professor Snape to be her surgeon. People have different ideas about hypnotism based on what they see on TV or what they have seen some guy do down the pub. But people certainly don't leave here clucking like chickens,' he laughs. Hypnotists use visualisation techniques to make people believe an event has happened (posed by models) 'Basically it is about relaxation, not control. There are no swinging watches. It is not a state as such it's a sort of relaxation.' Nichola said it certainly worked for her. She's dropped from a dress size 18-20 to 12-14 and can't wait to show off her new figure this summer. She said: 'We are off to the Maldives to celebrate . my husband's 50th birthday in November and I'm going to be wearing that . little white bikini on the beach.'","Nichola Prichard, 45, has slimmed down from 14st 1lb to 11st 13lb .

"Trapped in the wrong body for nearly half a century, one women made the brave decision to go under the knife to celebrate her 47th birthday. Born a boy named Sam, Samantha Denning, 47, always felt like a woman inside a male body, but she battled her feelings and overcompensated with motorbikes, weightlifting and dressing in masculine leather jackets. Struggling with suicidal thoughts, she confided in her nephew who persuaded her to finally start living as a woman. Samantha Denning (left, today) made the brave decision to go under the knife to celebrate her 47th birthday with gender reassignment surgery. She has spent her life overcompensating for her feelings of being a woman trapped in a man's body with very masculine hobbies and clothing (right) After four years of hormone treatment Miss Denning, of Bristol, celebrated her 47th birthday in September 2014 with NHS-funded gender reassignment surgery. She said: 'I'm finally able to be myself for the first time in my life. 'I've always known I am woman, now I truly feel like one. I couldn't have asked for a better birthday present.' Miss Denning kept her feelings to herself while growing up and felt confused about why she did not fit in with classmates. Samantha, here as a young boy called Sam, says she felt more comfortable dressed as a girl from the age of six . She said: 'I always preferred the company of girls. While the boys at school liked football, I tried to join the netball team. I couldn't understand why I was turned away. 'I was bullied mercilessly and had to change school several times. My skull was caved in after one particularly horrific incident which hospitalised me after a bunch of boys jumped on me for being 'queer'. 'I spent most of my time on my own. I didn't feel comfortable being around people.' From the age of six, the unhappy child would sneak into her sister's wardrobe and try on girls' clothing in secret. She said: 'I felt at ease in women's clothing. It wasn't a sexual thing. It made me more comfortable. 'I used to try on my sister's jeans, t-shirts, jumpers and tops. Then I started to try on her swimming costumes. I used paint from my art set as makeup.' After she left school Miss Denning tried desperately to fit in as a male. She grew a beard, listened to heavy metal music, started weight-lifting, wore leathers and drove a motorbike. She said: 'I did everything I could to try and fit in. I tried to bulk myself up with weight-lifting. I had always been very slight in school. 'When I look back at the pictures I think I look terrible - no wonder I couldn't find a girlfriend. 'I now wear a much more fashionable leather jacket.' One night when she was 32 years old Miss Denning turned on the TV and stumbled across a documentary on gender reassignment. She then realised she wanted to make a permanent change and become a woman. She said: 'Finally, everything clicked into place. As I watched the people on the screen, it was like staring into a mirror. I felt like my whole life had been one big lie. 'I watched the documentary twice, then went online and started chatting to transgender people on message boards. 'Before watching the show I had no idea that this was even possible. I had been so confused as to why I was upset. Now I knew I was transgender, and everything made sense.' She ordered tablets from an online supplier and began years of self-administered hormone therapy. Desperately unhappy Samantha, left as Sam with her nephew, began taking hormones to become a woman aged 32 . She said: 'The hormones gave me mood swings, and I found the process slow and frustrating, but gradually my skin got smoother and my moods settled. I felt like I was getting somewhere.' As her appearance began to change, she became more and more terrified of telling her family and friends the truth. The former NHS administrator battled suicidal thoughts and even wrote a suicide note in preparation for ending her life. Then one evening she received a phone call from her nephew who had seen a comment she had left on a transgender message board online. She said: 'He was very quiet at first. Then he came over to my house. 'He saved my life by coming over and being so understanding. His support stopped me from taking my own life. Matthew even promised to help me tell my parents. He had a friend at college who was transgender, so he was very understanding.' On January 6th 2011 Miss Denning left her house in women's clothing for the first time in her life. That same month she told her parents she was a woman and started phoning all her friends to tell them her news. She said: 'A lot of my friends were disgusted and told me never to contact them again, which really hurt. I did hold on to a few true friends. 'More importantly, my parents slowly came to terms with it too. 'I donated all of my male attire to charity shops. Everything to do with the man I wasn't I threw away or gave away. I stepped out of the house as myself for the first time in my life. Now living as a woman following her gender reassignment Samantha runs a support group for other transgender people and is hoping to have breast augmentation to complete her transition . 'I suffered a lot of abuse from strangers when I began dressing as a woman in public, but I persevered.' Now, after four years of counselling and hormone therapy from her GP, Miss Denning took the final step in her transformation. She had an operation at Charing Cross Hospital to turn her penis into a vagina on September 29th 2014, just after her 47th birthday. She said: 'I woke up after surgery and I knew my life had changed forever. 'I had a look under the sheets and I saw that the bump was not there anymore. My new vagina was still covered in tape and bandages, but I felt happy.' Since her operation Miss Denning has worked with Bristol City Council on LGBT issues and runs a support group for other transgender people. Miss Denning, who is currently out of work recovering from surgery, is hoping to have breast augmentation to complete her transition from male to female. She said: 'I would love to be able to answer the door without having to find my padded bra. Having breasts would make me feel totally comfortable with people.'","Samantha Denning has always felt more comfortable dressed as a girl .

"Roman gladiators were subjected to strict training regimes, hours of physically exhausting tasks and battled to the death. But instead of eating a diet rich in protein like modern athletes, evidence suggests they managed these tasks on a diet of grain, washed down with a ‘sports drink’ of vinegar and ash. German researchers studied the collagen in the bones of Roman corpses found in a 2nd century cemetery to confirm theories of this vegetarian diet. Researchers from the MedUni Vienna examined bones from a 2nd century gladiator cemetery (pictured) in Turkey. Using spectroscopy, stable isotope ratios were investigated in the collagen of the bones, and results show that gladiators mostly ate a vegetarian diet and drank a 'tonic of ashes' as a form of sports drink . The cemetery was initially uncovered in 1933, in the Roman city of Ephesos, now in modern-day Turkey. At the time, Ephesos was the capital of the Roman province of Asia and had over 200,000 inhabitants. Using spectroscopy, researchers from the Department of Forensic Medicine at the MedUni Vienna studied stable isotope ratios, including levels of carbon, nitrogen and sulphur. Historic sources and ancient texts report that gladiators had their own diet, comprising of beans and grains, and they have been referred to as ‘hordearii’, or ‘barley eaters’. Their diet also featured oatmeal and dried fruit, and it is believed that they may have been larger than modern-day athletes to protect their bodies . Historic sources and ancient texts report that gladiators had their own diet, comprising of beans and grains, and they have been referred to as ‘hordearii’, or ‘barley eaters’. The word ‘barley eater’ relates to the fact that gladiators were probably given grain of an inferior quality. Research from MedUni in Vienna, which analysed bones found in a 2nd century Roman cemetery, has confirmed these claims. It found that meals of the individuals they examined would have consisted primarily of grain and meat-free meals. All individuals consumed plants including wheat and barley as staple food, while others ate beans. The findings also suggested these meals were washed down with a vinegar and plant ash drink, to give them energy, as a form of ancient sports drink. Despite the strict training regime, gladiators were seen as 'assets' and were well cared for. Their diet also featured oatmeal and dried fruit, and it is believed that they may have been larger than modern-day athletes to protect themselves from blows. They also looked at the ratio of strontium to calcium in the bone mineral. Levels of strontium indicate the amount of vegetable matter consumed over a lifetime, and the higher the levels the more likely that the diet is devoid of meat. In total, 53 individuals, including 22 gladiators, were analysed. The results revealed that meals consisted primarily of grain and meat-free meals. All individuals consumed plants including wheat and barley as staple food, while others ate beans. The cemetery was initially uncovered in 1933, in the Roman city of Ephesos, now in modern-day Turkey (pictured left). The city map of Roman Ephesos is pictured bottom right, with excavations sites shown top right. The cemetery is shown labelled DAM93G . Researchers also looked at the ratio of strontium to calcium in the bone mineral. Levels of strontium indicate the amount of vegetable matter consumed over a lifetime, the higher the levels the more likely that the diet is devoid of meat. All individuals examined ate a diet of wheat (left) and barley (right) The findings also suggested these meals were washed down with a vinegar and plant ash drink, to give them energy, as a form of ancient sports drink. ‘Plant ashes were evidently consumed to fortify the body after physical exertion and to promote better bone healing,’ explained study leader Professor Fabian Kanz. ‘Things were similar then to what we do today - we take magnesium and calcium, in the form of effervescent tablets, for example, following physical exertion. ‘Calcium is essential for bone building and usually occurs primarily in milk products.’ In total, 53 individuals, including 22 gladiators, were analysed. This images shows a gladiator tombstone excavated in the Turkish cemetery. A further research project is looking at the migration of gladiators, who often came from different parts of the Roman Empire to Ephesos . Historic sources and ancient texts report that gladiators had their own diet, comprising of beans and grains, and they have previously been referred to as ‘hordearii’, or ‘barley eaters’. The word ‘barley eater’ relates, in this case, to the fact that gladiators were probably given grain of an inferior quality, explained researcher Professor Fabian Kanz. According to the research, the difference between the diets of gladiators and the ‘normal population’ of the region is highly significant in terms of the amount of strontium measured in their bones. A further research project is looking at the migration of gladiators, who often came from different parts of the Roman Empire to Ephesos. The researchers are hoping that comparison of the bone data from gladiators with that of the local fauna will yield a number of differences. The findings are published in the journal Plos One.","Study claims Roman gladiators ate grains and beans, with a tonic of ashes .

"He may have made history by helping Philae land on comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko. But British Rosetta Project Scientist Dr Matt Taylor is hopeless at parking and finding his car in large multistorey car parks, according to his sister. She described him as ‘brilliant,’ but ‘lacking common sense’ just hours after this team at the European Space Agency (Esa) guided the Philae lander the duck-shaped rock after a four billion mile journey. Scroll down for video . Dr Matt Taylor, Rosetta Project Scientist (pictured)  is one of the most important members of the team at Esa and made history by helping to land Philae on comet 67P yesterday. However, his sister has claimed that the scientist is not good at making small everyday life decisions or parking - and finding - his car in carparks . Dr Taylor, 40, is one most important people involved in the Rosetta mission and yesterday became a Twitter sensation because of his unorthodox appearance, involving bright shirts and an array of body art - including a tattoo on his leg of the space probe landing on the comet, which he got in January. The father-of-two from Manor Park in north east London now lives in the Netherlands with his wife Leanne and children Lily, 13 and Harry, 11. His sister Maxine, 39 told The Evening Standard that he is a genius but is sometimes so indecisive when making real-life decisions that he is useless. ‘He gets so involved in everything that sometimes common sense goes out the window - like losing the car in the car park, silly things. ‘If you go out with him you end up going round and round looking for a car parking space...he doesn’t want to make decisions.’ His wife admitted that the scientist is terrible at following directions and has lost track of where he has parked his car on many occasions. While there was jubilation in mission control yesterday when Philae touched down on the comet’s surface, Esa scientists are now concerned about the future of the  probe after it was revealed that it is likely stuck in a cave on the surface of the comet - and it may also be on its side. The scientist was so positive that the mission to land on the comet would be successful that he got the triumphant moment of landing permanently etched on his body (pictured). Dr Taylor became a Twitter sensation thanks to his flamboyant dress sense and colourful body art . Esa scientists are concerned about the future of the Philae probe after it was revealed that the probe is likely stuck in a cave on the surface of the comet - and it may also be lying on its side. With limited access to sunlight, and only a maximum of 30 hours of charge in its battery, scientists now face a race against time to get useful data from the probe before it dies - or find a way to recharge its solar panels and keep Philae alive. If you look at the images we have at the moment, it looks like Philae is resting against a very irregular rock’, mission director Paolo Ferri told MailOnline. ‘There is some speculation about it being in a hole…honestly, we have no idea, because we haven’t seen all the images. ‘But what is more important is the attitude [angle] of the lander, and the clock is ticking for us to find this out.’ In a press conference in french Esa also added: 'We are in a kind of cave, not a very flat area.' And they said that the probe has access to 90 minutes of sunlight every 12 hours - which might be enough to keep it alive. With limited access to sunlight and only a maximum of 30 hours of charge in its battery, scientists now face a race against time to get useful data from the probe before it dies - or find a way to recharge its solar panels and keep Philae alive. Experts are now waiting with baited breath for the results of critical tests but said Philae is receiving a good signal and has already sent an image back from the comet. Scientists hope that by analysing the comet’s surface, it will offer fresh insights into the origins of Earth and the solar system. Dr Taylor’s sister revealed that the whole family is ‘immensely proud’ of Dr Taylor’s part in the 25 year mission. His daughter sent him a message on Twitter that reads: ‘Dad! You’re famous! Haha how are you doing? Xx’ to which the scientist replied: ‘Just want to come home n see you lot xxxx’. He has become the poster-child of the ambitious mission after several video appearances wearing flamboyant shirts, showing off his tattoos. He was so sure that the mission to land on the comet would be successful that he had the moment permanently etched on his body in January. He told BBC Breakfast: ‘I'm incredibly confident that we're going to nail this landing. I'm confident enough to have it drawn on my body.’ Dr Taylor, the son of a brick layer, was reportedly told to cover his tattoos at media events in the past, but his appearance seems only to have increased his popularity. Twitter users praised Dr Taylor for being ‘a proper cool scientist’ and ‘definitely not boring’ after he appeared on the European Space Agency live stream and BBC Breakfast wearing a multi-coloured shirt emblazoned with illustrations of glamorous women, which he teamed with shorts, which showed off his tattoos. To convince his new team of his dedication, Dr Taylor promised that if Rosetta woke up from its hibernation, he would get a tattoo to commemorate the event. This video shows the creation of the tattoo . One Twitter user wrote: 'Dr Matt Taylor is what every scientist should look like - rad shirt, sleeve tattoos. Rad,' while another said: ‘Matt Taylor causing thousands of people to choke on their cornflakes this morning.’ Dr Taylor studied at the University of Liverpool and Imperial College London, winning a PhD in space plasma physics . He has worked at the European Space Agency since 2005 and was given the top scientific job on the mission in the summer of 2013. The role was a real change from his previous job, which was studying the physics of the northern lights, The Guardian reported. Professor Mark McCaughrean, senior science advisor at ESA, who appointed Dr Taylor, said that he took a chance on the young scientist as he would have to come up to speed with the mission quickly and gain the trust of older experts who had been working at ESA for decades. To convince them of his dedication, Dr Taylor promised that if Rosetta woke up from its hibernation, he would get a tattoo to commemorate the event. In January this happened, and a school friend turned tattoo artist etched a reminder of the ambitious mission on his leg. In his profile on the Rosetta project website, Dr Taylor says: ‘The opportunity to work on Rosetta was huge and I cannot begin to describe the excitement associated with this mission. It really is just so cool.’ Esa has successfully made contact with the Philae lander after it separated from the Rosetta spacecraft this morning at 08.35am GMT. It is now heading towards the comet and is expected to attempt to land on the surface at 4pm GMT. Pictured right is Paolo Ferri, Head of Mission Operations, celebrating making contact . Rosetta has chased comet 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko through space for more than ten years in what has been described as 'the sexiest, most fantastic mission ever'. After a four billion mile (6.5 billion km) journey, it is now positioned in an orbit 19 miles (30 km) away from 67P .","Dr Taylor is the Rosetta Project Scientist at the European Space Agency .

"Animal victims of the wildfires that has ravaged the coastal city of Valparaiso in central Chile which has killed at least 15 people and left 11,000 homeless, are being treated for their injuries at a local vet clinic. Some of the animals are strays, but many were accompanied by their distraught owners who had returned to their neighbourhoods after the still-raging fires destroyed more than 2,500 homes in the city. Volunteer veterinarians are now trying to treat as many animals as possible, as the population of Valparaiso's slums return to their streets after days of fires, only to discover their houses in ruins. Victim: A cat gets treated for burns by volunteer veterinarians, who managed to rescue animals from the uncontrolled wildfire still affecting the poorer urban areas of the city of Valparaiso, Chile . Pain of the innocent: A man sits next to his injured dog as it is treated by a volunteer vet following the blaze which has killed at least 15 people in Valparaiso . Casualty: A veterinary nurse tends to young dogs that suffered burns in the fire that has seen 11,000 people evacuated, at a temporary animal hospital in the Chilean city . The . fires, so hot they created their own fierce winds, consumed a entire neighborhoods on the Valparisian hills. In other districts, some houses stood unscathed . but remained in danger from glowing embers carried by the shifting . winds. 'We are looking at . the largest air operation ever assembled against a fire like this,' Chilean President Michelle Bachelet said. She said the blazes had grown to 'dimensions never before seen.' Chile's . forestry agency predicted it would take three weeks to completely stamp . out the fires, which began Saturday in a forested ravine and quickly . spread into ramshackle housing on one of Valparaiso's 42 hills. Hot . dry winds blowing out to sea whipped embers onto other neighborhoods on . six densely populated hills where people live in poorly constructed . homes without municipal water or sewer connections, fire hydrants or . streets wide enough for emergency vehicles. Volunteers, like these women, are caring for the injured pets and street animals which have been found in areas ravaged by the forest fire over the weekend . Human loss: A resident, whose house was damaged by the fire, talks on a phone in a shelter for victims of the blaze in Valparaiso . Witnessing destruction: Two residents of the hillside neighbourhoods of Valparaiso whose home was destroyed by the devastating blaze feed a pig amid the destruction in their street . Returning home: Volunteers help in clearance work at a hill in Valparaiso, following the fire, which began on 12 April on a forestry road, near Valparaiso's La Polvora road, but quickly expanded to several populated  neighboring hills . On Monday, there was no end in sight. Helicopters were flying without pause, dumping water on hotspots. Aid . was flowing in from all over Chile to Valparaiso, where evacuees . crowded into eight shelters. Hundreds of young volunteers climbed hills . carrying bottles of water and shovels to help victims search the ruins . of their homes. 'We're . going to rebuild right here. Where else would we go?' said Carolina . Ovando, 22, who lost the humble home she kept with three small children. Schools were closed, some of them damaged by fires and others jammed with evacuees. Navy . officer Julio Leiva said Monday that the death toll rose to 15. Most of . the bodies were too badly burned to identify without DNA tests, the . national forensics service said. More than 500 people were treated at . hospitals, mostly for smoke inhalation. Bachelet . coordinated the emergency response with her Cabinet, cancelling a trip . to Argentina and Uruguay. She asked Chile's neighbors for backup in case . of other fires, freeing Chilean planes and helicopters to join the . fleet in Valparaiso. Argentine .

"With memories of summer flings fading faster than their tan lines the singletons of Britain are bracing themselves for lower temperatures and a dip in their standards. Finite relationships are beginning up and down the country as men and women prepare for what is being dubbed as 'the cuffing season', a phenomenon involving lone rangers deciding to 'cuff' themselves to an unwitting partner so they have someone to attend parties with and cuddle up to in winter. As the temperatures drop, so do our romantic standards.. the cuffing season has begun . Many romance experts warn that if you find yourself in a seasonal-specific relationship like this you should beware of forming attachments as come spring you may be dumped. But FEMAIL Sexpert Tracey Cox is a little more optimistic. She says: 'It's absolutely true that people feel more comfortable being single in summer - everyone is a lot more social when the weather is good, so you're less lonely if you're not paired up. Snuggly weather makes you wish for someone to snuggle up with! 'But while I think cuffing is a real phenomena, most people do it on a subconscious basis rather than deliberately choosing relationships they assume will only last a few months. 'Most of us find it hard to separate our hearts from our heads. It's a bit like casual sex. A lot of one-night-stands end up turning into long term love, even if we never expected it to!' Lone rangers in the UK are increasingly 'cuffing' themselves to an unwitting partner for the winter . Sex and relationship blogger Nixalina Watson of the award-winning Sex And London City says: 'I have heard of cuffing season before and believe it or not, it happens a lot more than people think. 'The idea makes me chuckle - basically grabbing yourself a seasonal partner then ditching them when the sun comes out. It is like hibernation of your single life. We all prefer to stay indoors during the cold winter months and, if single, this isn't as fun as cuddling up to someone. 'I know a girl who realised she'd been dragged into the cuffing season only after he ditched her come March. Brutal. She thought long term, he thought only until winter is over. 'You don't want a partner who says ""I will love you until the clocks go forward"".' An anonymous twenty-something London-based designer added: 'It's a running joke with my friends that every year around autumn time I get a new boyfriend, it's like clockwork. Guys all seem to be looking for a girlfriend in the winter, then in summer no one wants to settle down - they're just looking for easy hook ups which I'm not really into. 'Saying that, I've always broken up with guys just before summer - not intentionally but summer gives you the feeling that you don't want to be tied down by something that's not really working. You want to be free to have fun. In winter, your friends are less likely to want to go out in the cold and do things, but having a relationship is like guarantee for having company.' Many singletons are facing up to the cold hard fact that they want some temporary companionship . People are noticing their friends hooking up and are suspicious it's down to cuffing season . Chris HInes, Editor-In-Chief of music magazine Hit The Floor, reveals a man's view: 'I've never known it as cuffing season as such, but this time of year is definitely where those who were longing for a summer romance, and failed, or people who had a bit too much fun, seem to want to all of a sudden settle down. 'Why? Maybe it's just the weather making people sad and everyone lowers their standards. I can imagine that previous 6 becoming a strong 8; perhaps thanks to 'Winter Goggles'. 'Come the Spring it's all about the 'culling' though. If you're looking for a serious relationship you best be ready to put the leg work in good and start getting good at buying Christmas presents!' Match.com's Kate Taylor adds: 'Winter is a wonderful time of year to be in love. Have you ever seen a Richard Curtis film that doesn't feature snow falling, or a kiss under the mistletoe? We often find people looking for love in the winter aren't hoping for a seasonal fling that dies before the clocks go forward.'

"Holidaymakers got more than they bargained for when on safari at a South African game reserve. The tourists were given an uncensored view of wild animals in their natural habitat. In dramatic footage taken by staff at the Londolozi ecotourism reserve, on the western border of Kruger National Park, tourists can be seen in a jeep watching a fierce stand-off between hyenas and lions over a buffalo carcass. Tourists: Visiting safari tourists film the lions and the hyenas on their mobile phones and cameras . The pride of lions had been eating a buffalo carcass when a few hungry hyenas came to demand a share. Shortly after the big cats were located by the trackers, more hyenas arrived and the aggressive confrontation kicked off. In the sometimes distressing footage, a tourist can be heard saying: 'I can't watch.' The larger big cats eventually scare the persistent cackle away and the lions were left to devour the remains of the buffalo. The animals were tracked by Londolozi tracker Judas Ngomane and ranger Don Heyneke during a morning game drive. The hyenas and the lions meet at the edge of a pond at the Londolozi ecotourism reserve . Carcass: The hyenas gather around the carcass of a buffalo and begin eating it . The whole sighting lasted for around 45 minutes. Rose Hipwood, founder of The Luxury Safari Company, which arranges trips to Londolozi, said holidaymakers 'dream' of seeing some good 'predator action' whilst on safari. She added: 'The combination of Londolozi's unrivalled location, abundant wildlife and exceptional guides means that the game viewing here is second to none. 'An experience such as this, which the guide has positioned the guests perfectly for is truly once in a lifetime. These two giants of the African predators battle it out often, but never with such force of numbers or such drama.'","Large groups of lions and hyenas battle it out for buffalo .

"It might not just be men who are from Mars, claims a new study which suggests that all life on Earth actually began on the red planet. An element believed to be crucial to the origin of life would only have been available on the surface of Mars, it is claimed. Geochemist Professor Steven Benner argues that the 'seeds' of life probably arrived on Earth in meteorites blasted off Mars by impacts or volcanic eruptions. As of the application deadline a week ago, more than 200,000 people from 140 different countries have applied to be among the first colonists on Mars . As evidence he points to the oxidised . mineral form of the element molybdenum, thought to be a catalyst that helped . organic molecules develop into the first living structures. Professor Benner will present his findings to geochemists gathering today at the annual Goldschmidt conference. ‘In addition recent studies show that these conditions, suitable for the origin of life, may still exist on Mars,’ said Professor Benner, of the Westheimer Institute for Science and Technology in Gainesville, Florida. ‘It’s only when molybdenum becomes highly oxidised that it is able to influence how early life formed. ‘This form of molybdenum couldn’t have been available on Earth at the time life first began, because three billion years ago the surface of the Earth had very little oxygen, but Mars did. ‘It’s yet another piece of evidence which makes it more likely life came to Earth on a Martian meteorite, rather than starting on this planet.’ Molybdenum can be mined from becomes  Molybdenite (pictured). Scientists believe the oxidised form of molybdenum was available on Mars, but not on Earth . The research Professor Benner will present at the conference tackles two of the paradoxes which make it difficult for scientists to understand how life could have started on Earth. The first is dubbed by Professor Benner as the ‘tar paradox’. All living things are made of organic matter, but if you add energy such as heat or light to organic molecules and leave them to themselves, they don’t create life. Instead, they turn into something more like tar, oil or asphalt. Prof Benner added: ‘Certain elements seem able to control the propensity of organic materials to turn into tar, particularly boron and molybdenum, so we believe that minerals containing both were fundamental to life first starting. ‘Analysis of a Martian meteorite recently showed that there was boron on Mars; we now believe that the oxidised form of molybdenum was there too.’ Analysis of a Martian meteorite recently showed that there was boron on Mars (pictured). Boron is though tot be another key element for life . The second paradox is that life would have struggled to start on the early Earth because it was likely to have been totally covered by water. Not only would this have prevented sufficient concentrations of boron forming - it’s currently only found in very dry places such as Death Valley - but water is corrosive to RNA, which scientists believe was the first genetic molecule to appear. Although there was water on Mars, it covered much smaller areas than on early Earth. Prof Benner said: ‘The evidence seems to be building that we are actually all Martians; that life started on Mars and came to Earth on a rock. ‘It’s lucky that we ended up here nevertheless, as certainly Earth has been the better of the two planets for sustaining life. ‘If our hypothetical Martian ancestors had remained on Mars, there might not have been a story to tell.’ Scientists have discovered that Martian meteorites found on Earth could be four billion years younger than previously thought, meaning that Mars could still be geologically active. A team of researchers has shown that a meteorite from the Mars collection at the Royal Ontario Museum in Canada started as a 200 million-year-old lava flow on Mars. In a paper published in the journal Nature, a new technique using isotopic and micro-structural analysis is described to determine the age of rocks. Scientists from the University of Portsmouth, the Royal Ontario Museum, the University of Wyoming and the University of California, claim that the rocks left Mars 20 million years ago. Previously it was thought the rocks could be up to 4,000 million years old. Nearly 100 meteorites found on Earth are thought to be from Mars.","Molybdenum mineral is thought to have been crucial to the origin of life .

"An Alaskan judge has recommended that a medical custody order that has kept a 27-year-old insomniac in hospital for seven months should be lifted. Hunting guide Bret Bohn was taken to hospital in October last year after he started to hallucinate after not sleeping for 11 days. But in November Bohn was put into protective custody after his parents, Lorraine and Glen Bohn, and the doctors treating him disagreed about the medication he was being prescribed. Hope: Bret Bohn could soon be free of a medical custody order which his family claim has led to him being given strong medication . Change: Bret Bohn was working as a hunting guide when he suffered insomnia brought on by steroids he had been prescribed . When Bohn's condition deteriorated, his parents wanted to have power of attorney but a court ruled in favor of the state having protective custody. The resulting state guardianship order, which was put into place on November 15, led to an anxious and lengthy legal battle by his family to gain access to him and have a say in his treatment. If the recommendation to end the protective order is agreed by a superior judge, Bohn will once again have the right to make his own decisions about his medical treatment, as well as personal and financial choices. ''He can be his own man again,' the family's attorney, Mario Bird, told the Alaska Dispatch, adding that Bohn would be released from the care of his state-appointed guardian. The 27-year-old, who worked as a guide in Wasilla, had fallen sick during a hunting trip on October 11. He was prescribed anti-anxiety drugs and medication for insomnia, but within a few days he had become unresponsive. Reunited: Lorainne Bohn, pictured right with Bret, was prevented from regularly visiting her son . Family: Bret and his father, Glen, walk along the corridor of a Seattle medical center after his mother stole him away from the place where he was being treated . It is thought his original case of insomnia was a side effect of steroids he had been prescribed while recovering from an operation. By January, doctors said he was suffering from autoimmune encephalitis, in which his immune system was attacking his brain. When his parents clashed with doctors over complaints that the drugs he was prescribed were causing him to deteriorate, they had their visits limited to just one hour a day. Friends of Bohn described how the practical joker who loved the outdoors quickly became a shell of a man, unable to get up or hold a conversation. A picture posted of on the Free Bret Bohn Facebook page in April showed the once fit young man with a face swollen from medication. 'A picture tells alot! Bret is definately declining on all these drugs,' the accompanying caption read. The situation came to a head shortly after that picture was taken. As a hospital worker tried to take Bohn back to a locked ward in his wheelchair, the young man's mother, Lorraine Philips-Bohn, intervened. She allegedly pushed the hospital employee aside and fled with her son, according to court documents. Fun loving: Before his insomnia, and seven-month hospital stay, Bret was full of life . Unresponsive: Bohn went from being an active hunting guide to a shell of his former self . Progress: The courts have recommended that Bohn should be allowed to make his own decisions again . When Mrs Bohn was arrested at a medical clinic in Seattle for kidnapping, she told police she had just wanted a second opinion on her son's condition, the Daily News reported. No formal charges were made against her. Bohn wasn't present at his hearing on Friday, but he listened into the proceedings on a telephone. He is currently staying with family in Idaho. After the hearing, his attorney, Mr Bird said: 'I think all the parties have come to the agreement that Bret Bohn has regained capacity - thanks be to God - and he is now ready to reenter society as the young man he was before he had a guardian placed over him last fall.' Bohn's mother added that her son was happy to have his rights back, and said: 'He's doing great, able to make his own decisions ... I’m just happy, really happy.'","Bret Bohn was taken to hospital in October after suffering side effects from prescription steroids .

"Just weeks after city officials in suburban Miami decided Donald Trump was worthy of having a key to the city, he's accusing them of having an unconstitutional noise ordinance. Trump told the Miami Herald on Wednesday that Doral needs a noise ordinance with 'specific rules and regulations.' Records show that since August, the city's code compliance department has issued more than 100 violations to Trump's resort, Trump National Doral. Most violations are for the resort's lawn maintenance crews making 'unreasonably loud noise.' In a lawsuit filed February 12, Trump said the ordinance 'is vague and ambiguous in its definition of prohibited activity, and provides the city's Code Enforcement Department with unfettered discretion for determining whether a violation exists.' Suing: Donald Trump has sued the city of Doral, Florida after his hotel there was issued some $150,000 worth of noise complaints . The city has yet to be served the paperwork, but City Attorney Daniel Espino told the Herald on Wednesday that he's disappointed a lawsuit was filed. 'Instead of striving to resolve the residents' noise concerns, the Trump resort has escalated this situation unnecessarily,' Espino wrote in an email. Espino says he will defend the city, its code and the public welfare. 'It is, however, my continued hope that the Resort will look to be a good neighbor and resolve this situation amicably,' Espino said. Trump rejects the accusations against his resort. 'This is the finest resort in the world and you have to cut the grass,' Trump said. 'Why is it that we have brand new equipment and get fined, when the people who had the property before me didn't get any citations?' he said. 'Maybe it's because I have money.' Trump's lawyers say he's already spent $50,000 in legal fees to fight the citations. They say since buying the property out of bankruptcy in 2012, Trump has pushed the city to amend the noise ordinance . Trump's lawyers say each violation carries a $1,500 fine and he's already spent $50,000 in legal fees to fight the citations. They say since buying the property out of bankruptcy in 2012, Trump has pushed the city to amend the noise ordinance. The resort recently hosted the Miss Universe pageant. Trump says he's not sure whether the lawsuit will interfere with the plan to award him a key to Doral. 'If it does, this is much more important,' he said. 'They may be giving me the key to the city, but I have not been treated right.' Donald Trump, no stranger to noisy publicity, is complaining again about the roar of jets in a $100 million lawsuit over air traffic he says is purposely being directed to fly over his ritzy Palm Beach club. Trump filed the suit against Palm Beach County last month, claiming his history of conflict with Palm Beach International Airport has led officials to spitefully redirect air traffic over his historic Mar-a-Lago estate in south Florida. 'I am saving one of the great houses of this country and one of its greatest landmarks,' he said in an interview, 'and it's being badly damaged by the airplanes.' Rather than fanning air traffic in multiple directions, Trump says the county's airports director -- who has been named in prior litigation filed by the real estate mogul -- has successfully pressured the Federal Aviation Administration to have controllers direct almost all flights due east, directly above Mar-a-Lago, the lawsuit claims. It calls the actions 'deliberate and malicious.' Noise, vibrations and emissions from the planes are causing cracks and other damage to porous stone construction, antique Spanish tiles, roofing, floors and columns, not to mention disrupting 'the once serene and tranquil ambience,' the lawsuit says.","The real estate magnate has filed suit against Doral, Florida, where his Trump National has drawn over 100 noise complaints from residents .

'If you look closely at the picture, there is no balance and the perspective is very wrong and disproportionate. 'In my work I have reshaped her booty in order to give harmony and balance. I wanted to improve and capture the best of Kardashian's back, without overdoing it. I like her but I'm just terrified about what will happen in a few years when her booty will ""collapse"".'

Food items has also been another way to describe Kim's glistening rear; from peaches and potatoes to glazed donuts the internet went to the market on comparisons. 'Krispy Kim' proved to be an apt nickname for the reality star, and her rear was even replaced with two pieces of Aero chocolate. She's had the yellow touch, too!

"When authorities found an 11-year-old Guatemalan boy's body just about a mile from Texas' southern border, they also discovered his brother's Chicago phone number scribbled on the inside of his belt buckle. The boy, wearing Angry Birds jeans, black leather boots and a white rosary around his neck, had apparently gotten lost on his way north from his native country and was found earlier this month, alone in the brush less than a mile from the nearest U.S. home, a South Texas sheriff said Monday. While hundreds of immigrants die crossing the border each year, the discovery of Gilberto Francisco Ramos Juarez's decomposed body in the Rio Grande Valley earlier this month highlights the perils unaccompanied children face as the U.S. government searches for ways to deal with record numbers of children crossing into the country illegally. Tragic: The boy had his brother's Chicago phone number written on the inside of his belt buckle when he was his body was found in the desert . Heartbreaking: The 11-year-old boy's Abgry Birds jeans helped authorities identify his body . 'Down here finding a decomposed body ... we come across them quite often,' Hidalgo County Sheriff Eddie Guerra said, adding that this was the first child immigrant his office has found since he became sheriff in April. 'It's a very dangerous journey.' More than 52,000 unaccompanied children have been apprehended entering the U.S. illegally since October, creating what President Barack Obama has called an 'urgent humanitarian situation.' On Monday, Obama asked Congress for more money and additional authority to deal with the surge of youths, mostly from Central America. Obama wants flexibility to speed the youths' deportations and $2 billion in new money to hire more immigration judges and open more detention facilities. The number of unaccompanied immigrant children arrested along the border has been rising for three years as they fled pervasive gang violence in Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador. More recently, children and parents have said they heard children traveling alone and parents traveling with young kids would be released by authorities and allowed to continue to their destination. Long hike: The boy was found wearing black boots on his long, hot journey through the desert . Common: Sheriff Eddie Guerra says finding decomposing bodies of immigrants in the desert is not uncommon . Far from home: Gilberto Francisco Ramos Juarez was found dead a mile from the border . Many of the . children turn themselves in to the first law enforcement person they . see, so Guerra said it was unusual to find a child in this more remote . area — near La Joya, about 20 miles west of McAllen. The . boy's body was found June 15. Sometimes smugglers leave people behind . if they can't go on; other times a group may scatter when authorities . approach. Investigators were able to reach the boy's brother in Chicago; his phone number was one of three on the boy's belt. It's . not uncommon for immigrants to put relatives' phone numbers on their . clothing because scraps of paper can get lost or wet during their . journey. The boy's brother gave authorities his father's phone number in Guatemala, and the dad identified the boy's personal items. Th boy was found in an area with dense brush and no water . The . cause of death has not been determined, but authorities suspect heat . stroke, Guerra said. The boy was no longer wearing a shirt when he was . found. An autopsy did not find signs of trauma and the pathologist . estimated the body had been there for about two weeks. The . boy's family in Huehuetenango, Chiantla, Guatemala, had last heard from . him about 25 days before his body was found. At that time, he was in . Reynosa, Mexico, waiting to cross the border. His father told . authorities the boy was traveling with a coyote, or smuggler. Although . the number of immigrant children who have died crossing into Texas was . not immediately available, such discoveries are not unheard of.","Boy identified at Gilberto Francisco Ramo Jaurez, who was found June 15 less than a mile from the border .

"Thousands of men with advanced prostate cancer are to miss out on a life-extending drug because of new NHS restrictions. Enzalutamide prolongs life by at least five months in men who have run out of treatment options – with some surviving more than 18 months. But health chiefs in England are issuing guidance which will stop it being prescribed to patients who have already received a different new drug called abiraterone. Restricted: Enzalutamide prolongs life by at least five months in men who have run out of treatment options . In effect, guidance from NHS England means men with advanced prostate cancer will only be able to get one of the two drugs – which British scientists helped to develop – on the NHS. Around 10,500 British men have advanced prostate cancer that has become resistant to standard hormone treatments. Up to 3,000 a year would benefit from the new drugs, which have been offered in turn to many patients either before or after chemotherapy in recent months. The Cancer Drugs Fund and the NHS have funded the drugs until now, while awaiting a decision from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice) on whether enzalutamide should be routinely funded. It was initially recommended for NHS funding last October, but Nice proposed in January that it should be banned for men in England and Wales previously treated with abiraterone. Men in Scotland are getting it without restrictions. The outcry over the plan led to Prostate Cancer UK spearheading a campaign, with over 13,500 people signing its petition. The protest had widespread support from high profile figures such as Sir Michael Parkinson and other organisations such as Tackle Prostate Cancer. Nice then performed another U-turn in April which seemed to go back to its original position of recommending enzalutamide regardless of a patient’s previous treatment. However, guidance from Nice today (wed) merely says there is not enough evidence to make a recommendation about how the two drugs should be used. NHS England, the body which advises local area cancer teams on which drugs to fund, says as a result of the lack of evidence patients who have been treated with abiraterone cannot have enzalutamide. It goes further, saying men who have received enzalutamide cannot then have the other drug – effectively restricting patients to only one drug during their treatment. Lethal: A scanning electron microscope image of human prostate cancer cells . Ian and Jackie Fitch are now selling . their possessions to raise money for enzalutamide to treat him. Mrs . Fitch said: ‘It’s just cruel and wrong. ‘Our . life is lived from one consultant appointment to the next, there’s no . dignity and now the NHS has snatched away the last hope for us both.’ Our life is lived from one consultant . appointment to the next, there’s no dignity and now the NHS has . snatched away the last hope for us both... The drug, a pill called Xtandi which is taken at home, costs around £25,000 for an average course of treatment. But the manufacturer Astellas Pharma has reduced the price through a patient access scheme which makes it cost effective, say Nice. Owen Sharp, Chief Executive of Prostate Cancer UK, said it had received notification of NHS England’s intended guidance. He said ‘We are extremely disappointed that NHS England has interpreted NICE’s guidance to mean that they are not obliged to fund enzalutamide for men who have had abiraterone. ‘We have heard many heartbreaking stories of men and their families  now left with nowhere to turn, with some resorting to raiding  their savings or fundraising to pay for enzalutamide privately. ‘The system has given with one hand and taken with another, cruelly snatching away once again a last hope of extra time with loved ones. ‘As these drugs are both relatively new there is not currently a huge volume of evidence to prove the efficacy of sequential use. ‘However in this situation the default position should not be to deny access. ‘Doctors should be enabled to prescribe whichever drugs they feel clinically appropriate and learn from the outcome, without having to worry that their decision may mean another door is closed further down the line.’","Patients who have already had abiraterone will not get enzalutamide .
It can prolong life by at least five months when other treatments have failed .
Patients in Scotland will have access to the drug with no restrictions ."
"These harrowingly intimate photographs reveal the daily violence of El Salvador's slum gangs. In poor parts of the Latin American country's capital, young people often say they have just two futures - either they can join the Mara Salvatrucha gang, or its deadly rivals Barrio 18 (18th Street). Despite the dangers, Czech photojournalist Jan Sochor spent three years among the gangs and police in San Salvador compiling an unprecedented picture of the unrest and despair they have caused. Scroll down for video . Slums: Czech photojournalist Jan Sochor spent three years among the gangs and police of El Salvador, compiling an unprecedented picture of the nation's unrest . Hunt: A policeman with El Salvador's special emergency unit, Halcones, chases two gang suspects down an alleyway between tin huts in the capital San Salvador . Tattoed: A gang suspect lies detained on the floor in a crime-ridden part of the Soyapango neighbourhood. Mr Sochor said the tattoos reminded him of warriors . No Christmas: This arrest by an anti-gang unit was made in December 2013, and a forlorn decorated tree can be seen inside next to ordinary household possessions . Intimacy: A Barrio 18 gang suspect gives a goodbye kiss to his wife in Soyapango, San Salvador, as he is detained in a night raid by an elite police unit . The 39-year-old said that although the murder rate in the country has dropped significantly - after a truce between the two major street gangs was agreed in 2012 - many people say crime is still rampant. Despite the truce, he said the gangs never stopped their criminal activities, including extortion, wholesale drug dealing and kidnapping. Mr Sochor, who began his Chasing The Homeboys project in 2011, said: 'Since I first stepped into Rio de Janeiro twelve years ago, Latin America has become a major inspiration for my photography work. From then on, I have been working and living in various Latin American countries. 'I stay focused on photojournalism with an intention to portray truthfully Latin America and its social, cultural and everyday phenomenons in all their complexity.' Based in Quito, Ecuador, Mr Sochor completed another project called Fear In El Salvador earlier in 2011. The photographer was partly inspired into his work after seeing pictures of the Mara gang members in the 1990s, their faces and bodies heavily tattooed. Armed: Mr Sochor went on night raids with police in San Salvador. Mr Sochor began his Chasing The Homeboys project in 2011 and said things have barely improved . Under arrest: A gang member is detained by police. Despite a truce, some say the gangs never stopped their criminal activities, including extortion and kidnap . 'They reminded me of the ancient tribe warriors,' Mr Sochor said. 'I followed the night patrols and raids of the anti-gang police unit in San Salvador' 'No one can leave the gang,' a local policeman told the Czech photographer. 'Once you get to the gang, it is a commitment to the end of your life' Bloodthirsty: The murder rate in San Salvador dropped after a truce between the rival gangs in 2012, but many residents say crime continues unabated . 'They reminded me of the ancient tribe warriors,' he said. 'I followed the night patrols and raids of the anti-gang Police unit in San Salvador, a troop that fights directly the major street gangs, the Mara Salvatrucha and 18th Street Gang.' Mr Sochor said he has not seen many signs of positive change. 'Although I wish I could say the things are getting better in El Salvador, especially issues related to gangs and violence, I cannot say that,' he said. 'From my point of view, violence is still the main issues in people's daily lives.' The photojournalist found one incident particularly memorable. 'In 2011 I was shooting in a gang neighbourhood,' he said.' I met a young man on the street, a Barrio 18 gang member, with his face completely tattooed. He was barely 18 or 20 years old. Holding a bible in his hand, he was going to the local church for the mass. Remains: An abandoned apartment used by gang members as a refuge which was stumbled upon by police officers on a night raid in the capital San Salvador . 'After three years, I found myself in the same neighbourhood where I had met the tattooed man,' the photographer said. 'I found a local policeman and asked about the tattoed man. ""He's dead. A year ago he was killed by people from his gang. He knew too much,"" the cop just shrugged' Violence: The Mara Salvatrucha and Barrio 18 gangs agreed a truce in 2012 which reportedly involved the government. But some details still remain a secret . 'I started to work on several themes there,' the photographer said. 'The more time I am spending there, I am becoming more involved with the people' 'After finishing his three-year sentence for killing a boy from a rival gang, he turned to God in the prison and swore he had left the gang.' 'But a local cop with whom I shared my experience told me: ""No one can leave the gang... Once you get to the gang, it is a commitment to the end of your life.""' 'After three years, I found myself in the same neighbourhood where I had met the tattooed man. I found a local policeman and asked about the tattoed man. ""He's dead. A year ago he was killed by people from his gang. He knew too much,""  the cop just shrugged.' The sad incident made the photographer even keener to document the country. 'I started to work on several themes there,' he said.' The more time I am spending there, I am becoming more involved with the people, and the more stories I find to tell. I would like to keep working in El Salvador in the future.' Marked: The gangs show their territory by leaving graffiti on walls. The violence has continued for many years despite the efforts of police and the government . Colourful: The neighbourhoods are lively, but they are also plagued by crime. Some wealthy people hire private security and drive bulletproof cars . Surprisingly to many, initial reports suggested the truce had an effect. The crime rate dropped some 70 per cent. But not all citizens of San Salvador are in agreement . Reading his rights: A woman looks on as specialist police handcuff a suspected gang member in the night - keeping their weapons at the ready as he lies on the floor . Home: But Mr Sochor said there were positive moments: 'Eating hot ""pupusas"", traditional Salvadoran handmade corn tortillas, during the long chilly nights' And there were enjoyable times too, he said - 'maybe eating hot ""pupusas"", traditional Salvadoran handmade corn tortillas, while following the policemen on the patrol during the long chilly nights.' Mr Sochor is one of many angry about the 2012 truce, saying he cannot judge whether it was effective as the conditions were never fully revealed to the public. 'I witnessed what ordinary Salvadoran people say and according to them, the truce is a cheat and it does not work,' he said. 'The main reason for their disillusion seems to be the fact that the gangs have never stopped their criminal activities, including extortions, distribution of drugs and kidnappings.' In April officials said the murder rate, which dropped from 14 to five per day after the truce, had risen to nine per day since January. Members of the Mara 18 gang have orders to take revenge against police and soldiers who wound or kill one of their own, officials added. Public Safety Minister Ricardo Perdomo said: 'If there is a shootout with police and a gang member is killed or wounded, the whole gang has to take revenge on the officer who fired against that gang member, that's the order.' Between January and April there were 61 attacks on police in El Salvador, up from 30 in the same period of 2013. An estimated 20,000 Salvadorans belong to street gangs that deal drugs and extort businesses.

"Crash investigators have said Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 broke up in the air over eastern Ukraine after it was struck by multiple 'high-energy objects from outside the aircraft'. A newly-released report contains pictures of the downed airliner showing holes in the fuselage and cockpit which could have been caused by shrapnel from an exploding anti-aircraft missile. The carefully-worded initial report avoids saying that the plane was shot down or making any suggestion as to who was responsible. A preliminary report into the disaster by the Dutch Safety Board said it was likely the damage caused 'resulted in a loss of structural integrity of the aircraft, leading to an in-flight break up.' Scroll down for video . Analysis: Images of the wreckage by the Dutch Safety Board highlighted where the plane was damaged. Circled are holes in the fuselage which could have been caused by shrapnel from an exploding anti-aircraft missile . Mystery: Investigators said 'a large number of high-energy objects penetrated the aircraft from outside' The Boeing 777 suddenly plunged out of the sky on July 17 over pro-Russian rebel-held territory in Ukraine, killing all 298 passengers and crew on board. The report said: 'The damage observed in the forward section of the aircraft appears to indicate that the aircraft was penetrated by a large number of high-energy objects from outside the aircraft. 'It is likely that this damage resulted in a loss of structural integrity of the aircraft, leading to an in-flight break up.' The board is leading the international investigation into the cause of the disaster. Its full report is expected within a year of the crash. Although the report drew no conclusions about responsibility, U.S. State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf said the findings were consistent with 'our original assessment, that it was likely shot down by one of these surface-to-air missiles fired from separatist-controlled territory in eastern Ukraine.' 'I'm unaware of other objects or ways that it could be brought down that are consistent with that finding,' Harf said of the report. 'It highlights questions for which Russia must still answer.' Catastrophic: Puncture marks (yellow arrow) and pitting (red arrow) in the plane's fuselage . A preliminary report into the disaster by the Dutch Safety Board said Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 broke up in the air over eastern Ukraine after it was struck by multiple 'high-energy objects from outside the aircraft' The Boeing 777 suddenly plunged out of the sky on July 17 over pro-Russian rebel-held territory in Ukraine, killing all 298 passengers and crew on board . Deadly: Russian air defense missile system Buk  seen at a military show in Zhukovsky outside Moscow in 2010 . Christopher Yates, an aviation safety specialist at Yates Consulting, said the report 'is extremely consistent with damage from a missile for the simple reason there are penetration marks'. 'It must have been moving at very high velocity to create the damage,' he said. 'It could only be a missile of the type that would reach the altitude that would have struck the aircraft' – potentially a Buk missile. The slow pace of the inquiry, its cautious preliminary conclusion and the fact that wreckage and human remains are still lying in Ukraine frustrated and angered victims' families. 'Well, I don't know what to say about this,' said Samira Calehr, a Dutch mother who lost two sons, 11-year-old Miguel and 19-year-old Shaka, in the crash. Evidence: A picture of the cockpit voice recorder from the Boeing 777 of Malaysia Airlines flight MH17, released by Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) through the Dutch Safety Board . She said that she wants the people responsible for downing the plane brought to justice 'as soon as possible,' pausing for emphasis on every word. 'I want to know who killed my children.' Zenaida Ecal, a 53-year-old resident of Pagbilao in the northeastern Philippines who lost her best friend, Irene Gunawan, expressed frustration that the report discloses only what many already knew - that the Malaysian plane came under fire - but fails to identify the perpetrators. 'We just want all of the victims to be found, identified and given a proper burial. We want the perpetrators to be identified and punished. As long as these don't happen, all the families and friends of the victims will continue to suffer,' Ecal said. 'It's taking so long.' Tribute: Flowers and soft toys left at a monument for Malaysia Airlines Flight MH17 crash site in the village of Hrabove (Grabovo), some 80km east of Donetsk . A separate Dutch-led criminal investigation is underway aimed at bringing the perpetrators to justice. Tjibbe Joustra, chairman of the Dutch Safety Board that is leading the international investigation, acknowledged the preliminary report - mandated by international aviation guidelines - did not shed much new light on the downing of the Boeing 777. 'Perhaps you could say we are a little bit behind, but we are not behind with the truth. We try to make a report that's for the next of kin - very important - but also for history,' he said. 'I understand a lot of people say, `Why don't they work a little quicker?' But this will take its time,' he added. Pro-Russian rebels officially deny having shot down the plane, but unofficially one senior rebel admitted they were behind a missile strike. Just three hours before the plane was shot down above rebel-held territory in Eastern Ukraine, the Associated Press reported on the passage of a Buk M-1 missile system - a machine the size of a tank bearing four ground-to-air missiles - driving through the rebel-held town of Snizhne, near the crash site. The Buk uses a proximity fuse aboard the missile that determines when it will detonate, creating an explosion of shrapnel to destroy the target. Russian sources launched a scathing and concerted attack on the MH17 crash report yesterday evidently in a bid to undermine any future criticisms that missiles or military personnel from Moscow were responsible for the crash. Several senior figures were given license to question the motives of the 'careless' Dutch-led investigation into the doomed Malaysia Airlines aircraft. One suggested a Western plot to hide the real cause of the crash of the Malaysian Boeing 777-200, which among some figures in Moscow is blamed on the Ukrainian army. Pyotr Deinekin, a former Russian Air Force commander and the chairman of the public council of the Russian Federal Air Transport Agency (Rosaviatsia), declared:'I was totally shocked by the data published by the investigative commission. 'Did it take them so long to find out that the Boeing was in good repair? It was clear from the start there would be no claims against the airplane's serviceability.' He said accusingly: 'The Netherlands is careless, it draws conclusions before examining the plane's debris and body fragments.' Meanwhile, rebel official in Donetsk, Miroslav Rudenko, told Interfax alleged that the downing the the plane was 'a provocation carried out by the Ukrainian armed forces in order to discredit Russia and the people's militia'. Forlorn: Wreckage of the plane remained at the crash site in eastern Ukraine today as the report was published . Terrifying: There were three other commercial aircraft in the area at the time of the tragedy . A highly-placed rebel officer told the AP in an interview in the aftermath of the disaster that the plane was shot down by a mixed team of rebels and Russian military personnel who believed they were targeting a Ukrainian military plane. Intercepted phone conversations between the rebels released by the Ukrainian government support that version of events. In those tapes, the first rebels to reach the scene can be heard swearing when they see the number of bodies and the insignia of Malaysia Airlines. In a statement, the board's chairman Tjibbe Joustra said: 'The initial results of the investigation point toward an external cause of the MH17 crash. 'More research will be necessary to determine the cause with greater precision. The Safety Board believes that additional evidence will become available for investigation in the period ahead.' Because of the ongoing conflict between pro-Russian rebels and Ukrainian forces, investigators from the board have not visited the fields where the wreckage of Flight 17 plunged to the ground.

Investigators so far have studied photos of the crash site, radar data and information gleaned from the downed jet's 'black boxes' - its cockpit voice recorder and flight data recorder. They all indicated that there was no technical fault that may have caused the plane to disintegrate. The cockpit voice recorder 'revealed no signs of any technical faults or an emergency situation,' the Safety Board said. 'Neither were any warning tones heard in the cockpit that might have pointed to technical problems.' Christopher Yates, an aviation safety specialist at Yates Consulting, told The Associated Press the report 'is extremely consistent with damage from a missile for the simple reason there are penetration marks.'

He said the report gave no indication whether the missile had been fired from the ground or from another aircraft, but it likely came from the ground as there were no military aircraft known to have been flying at the time. The missile could not have been shoulder-fired because it would not have reached the necessary altitude, Yates added.

"Hero: William Walker, who at 99 was the oldest remaining Battle of Britain pilot has died . He was the oldest of an ever-dwindling band of heroes, the Battle of Britain airmen who put their lives on the line for freedom. But Spitfire pilot William Walker always insisted he was just doing his job, never accepting he was brave. Yesterday, after his death at the age of 99, tributes were paid to a veteran who helped to stave off a Nazi invasion – and who left a legacy that will forever speak just as loud as his deeds. The Second World War flight lieutenant spent a lifetime championing The Few, raised money in their memory and wrote poetry in praise of their sacrifice. Weeks before he died on Sunday, after suffering a stroke at his home in West London, he was happily answering questions from schoolchildren who had asked him for first-hand accounts to help with a history project. ‘He knew how important it was that we continue to tell the story of what he and the rest of The Few did in 1940,’ said Battle of Britain Memorial Trust chairman Richard Hunting. ‘He was a warm, engaging and friendly man who always had a twinkle in his eye.’ Only 60 known Battle of Britain veterans are alive today. Flt Lt Walker’s story is typical of many of them – young men who served with the RAF as Hitler and the Luftwaffe prepared to invade Britain. Scroll down for video . Brave: William Walker looking at  the nose of a Spitfire - the type of plane he was shot down in in 1940 . Celebrated: William enjoys a laugh and a drink with the Prince of Wales at an event for RAF veterans . Royal approval: Stood with the Duchess of Cornwall and a magnificent Spitfire in the background at Capel Le Ferne in Kent . Proud: William Walker's ode to his dead comrades - Absent Friends - is still read at special events before a toast to them . Two days after celebrating his 27th . birthday he was scrambled to attack a large German bomber force heading . for targets which included RAF stations at Biggin Hill and Kenley. In a dogfight over the Channel with . Messerschmitt 109s, his plane was hit and badly damaged. He was shot in . the right ankle and baled out at 20,000ft. They fought the most important battle this country ever faced and their victory saved Britain from the tyranny of Nazi Germany. The heroes of the Battle of Britain repelled Hitler’s Luftwaffe in the summer of 1940, although only around 70 of them are still alive. At the time were in their late teens or early 20s when they took to the skies in Spitfires and Hurricanes from July to October 1940. Others flew in Blenheims, Beaufighters and Defiants, becoming the ‘aces’ of the Battle, shooting down plane after plane. During the Battle, Sir Winston Churchill said: ‘The gratitude of every home in our island, in our empire, and indeed throughout the world, goes out to the British airmen who, undaunted by odds, unwearied in their constant challenge and mortal danger, are turning the tide of the world war by their prowess and by their devotion. ‘Never in the field of human conflict was so much owed by so many to so few.’ When it was over, 544 RAF pilots and aircrew were dead and had made the ultimate sacrifice to keep generations of Britons safe. Landing in the water, he managed to swim to a wrecked ship on a sandbank and was picked up by a fishing boat some time later, bleeding and suffering from hypothermia.He was applauded by crowds when taken ashore at Ramsgate. ‘They cheered me up the harbour steps and a woman gave me a packet of cigarettes,’ he would later recall. After the war he resumed his work in the brewing trade and rose to become chairman of Ind Coope, a role previously held by his father.But he never forgot The Few. Two years ago he and a dozen other RAF veterans and their wives were taken on a 70th anniversary Battle of Britain memorial flight and given a guard-of-honour escort by a Hurricane and Spitfire flying alongside. ‘Beautiful aircraft,’ he told me  as he watched the Spitfire. ‘I’d love to fly one again.’ William Walker often read his poetry at memorial events. One is set in stone. It is inscribed alongside 2,936 names on the Kent coast’s Capel-le-Ferne memorial to those who served in the most critical action of the war, a permanent reminder of their dedication and sacrifice: . Behind each name a story lies  Of bravery in summer skies,  Though many brave unwritten tales Were simply told in vapour trails. In later life he dedicated a huge amount of time to the . Battle of Britain Memorial Trust. Active . until the very end, despite the aches and pains associated with his . advanced years, William had been planning to attend the Trust’s End of . the Battle Gala Dinner in the presence of the Patron, HRH Prince Michael . of Kent last Thursday but he suffered a stroke and was taken to . hospital where he later died. His . absence was made even more poignant by the fact that in recent years it . had become traditional for William to raise a toast to his fellow . Battle of Britain pilots after reading his poem 'Absent Friends'. Mr Walker wrote: 'Those unwell and far away, Those who never lived to see, The end of war and victory, And every friend who passed our way, Remembered as of yesterday, It's absent friends we miss the most, To all, let's drink a loving toast.' In 2011 his poems were published with the proceeds donated to the Battle of . Britain Memorial Trust. Richard Hunting CBE, chairman of the . Battle of Britain Memorial Trust, said: 'Flight Lieutenant William . Walker was a warm, engaging and friendly man who always had a twinkle in . his eye. 'He worked hard for the trust and gave freely of his time to help with . fundraising for The Wing - which is the trust's planned new building at . the Capel-le-Ferne site of the national memorial to The Few. 'He was much loved by his fellow veterans, his family and friends and all of us at the Battle of Britain Memorial Trust. 'He was regularly prevailed upon to recite one of his poems at trust . events and signed many copies of his book to help raise money for The . Wing. 'He knew how important it was that we continue to tell the story of what he and the rest of the Few did in 1940.'

"Vanessa Stiviano, the woman at the center of allegations of racism aimed at LA Clippers owner Donald Sterling, 80, has denied she is his girlfriend. Sources close to Stiviano has claimed that the 31-year-old works in a purely professional capacity for Sterling as his 'archivist' and spilts her time between the Clippers and the teams official charity. Stiviano is currently being sued by Sterling's estranged wife Shelly for allegedly embezzling $1.8 million from him during the four years she has been working for the billionaire. Scroll Down for Video . Silence: Vanessa Stiviano talks on the phone while wearing a sun visor over her head that covers her eyes on Sunday in California . Bizarre: Despite Stiviano's lawyer stating that the model wasn't Sterling's 'first rodeo', she is now claiming she isn't his girlfriend . Refusing to answer questions when reporters caught up with her outside her home on Sunday, Stiviano has allegedly been gifted four sports cars by Sterling and his wife believes the two have been involved in a relationship. This comes as it was claimed that Sterling contacted Stiviano to ask, 'How can we make this go away?' amid claims she has more than 100 hours of recordings, it has been reported. Stiviano has insisted a racist recording in which the NBA boss allegedly tells her not to bring black people to his games is authentic but she claims she wasn't the one who leaked it to the media. Sterling contacted Stiviano on Sunday and was told to contact her lawyer, TMZ Sports has now reported. Tape: Vanessa Stiviano, left, caused a firestorm when a tape she recorded of Donald Sterling making racist remarks were made public . Her attorney Mac Nehoray said in an e-mail Sunday to the Los Angeles Times V. Stiviano's attorney Mac Nehoray said Sunday that the male voice heard on the 15-minute recording making incredibly offensive remarks to his client about African Americans is definitely Sterling's. But the NBA boss claimed Stiviano released it in a bid to 'get even' with his wife, Shelly Sterling, who is suing the archivist for allegedly seducing her wealthy husband. 'Due to the present litigation and its absurd allegations, which Ms. Stiviano vehemently denies, Ms. Stiviano and this office have no comments at this time,' Nehoray said in a statement to the newspaper. Stiviano, 38, sparked a firestorm on Saturday by allegedly leaking the audio recording of the 81-year-old Clippers owner launching a racist rant in which he berated her for being seen in public with black friends, including Magic Johnson. Listen to the Rant here . Authentic: V. Stiviano's attorney Mac Nehoray said that the 15-minute recording definitely features Sterling making incredibly offensive remarks to his client, pictured, about African Americans . The shocking clip set off a massive scandal, with current and former NBA players like LeBron James and Charles Barkley calling on the league to take immediate action against Sterling. The NBA is investigating the claims and is set to make a decision within days. In the meantime, a lawsuit filed by Sterling's estranged wife of 50 years Rochelle claims to show how the Clipper’s owner treated his girlfriend before the apparent row – by lavishing her with a series of gifts including a Ferrari, two Bentleys, a Range Rover and a $1.4million apartment. In court documents filed March 7 by Sterling's spouse of 50 years and the mother of his three children, Rochelle Sterling writes that her husband and Stiviano - who also goes by the aliases Vanessa Maria Perez, Monica Gallegos, Maria Monica Perez Gallegos and Maria Valdez – first met in 2010 at the Super Bowl. According to Mrs Sterling's lawsuit, cited by the Los Angles Times, over the past four years, her husband used their commonly owned resources to buy his girlfriend a 2012 Ferrari, a pair of Bentleys and a 2013 Range Rover worth a total of more than $500,000. In additional to the high-end vehicles, some of which are prominently featured on Stiviano's instagram account documenting her high-flying lifestyle, Mr Sterling also gifted her $1.8million to buy a duplex on West 4th Street in Los Angeles and $240,000 for living expenses.

Heartbreaker: The vanity plate on Stiviano's red Ferrari reads: 'V Loves You' Mrs Sterling's lawsuit, which claims that her husband gave Stiviano money and presents without her consent, seeks full restitution along with unspecified compensatory damages. According to Rochelle Sterling, before she filed her complaint in court, Donald Sterling himself had asked Stiviano to return the money and property, but the woman allegedly refused. Stiviano's attorney, Mac Nehoray, presented a counter-argument, claiming that a gift cannot be revoked by the giver – legalese for ‘no taksies backsies.’ In a court filing, the lawyer also insisted that there is not ‘a peppercorn of a fact’ that his client committed any fraud or exercised undue influence. Nehoray added that nowhere in Mrs Sterling’s lawsuit does it say that ‘the feminine wiles of Ms. Stiviano overpowered the iron will of’ Donald Sterling, ‘who is well known as one of the most shrewd businessmen in the world.’","Vanessa Stiviano has kept silent this weekend after the release of tapes which allegedly reveal LA Clippers owner Donald Sterling making racist remarks .

"Being circumcised does not affect a man's sex life, a landmark study has revealed. Australian scientists analysed nearly 40 studies and concluded that the procedure had no effect on sensitivity or satisfaction. While some studies have previously reported a negative outcome, these were found to have flaws - and their reliability has been called into question by this latest research. Being circumcised does not affect a man's sex life, a landmark study has revealed. Australian scientists analysed nearly 40 studies and concluded that the procedure had no effect on sensitivity or satisfaction . The most scientifically rigorous studies, however, concluded the circumcision had little, if any, effect. Lead author of the study, Professor Brian Morris of the University of Sydney, told MailOnline: 'This is a ground-breaking article. 'The health benefits of male . circumcision have been well documented, including substantially lower . risks of HIV and other viral and some bacterial sexually transmitted . infections. 'It also lowers . rates of penile cancer and possibly prostate cancer - and women whose . partners are circumcised have lower rates of cervical cancer and . infections such as HPV and chlamydia. 'However, there is continued concern that circumcision may reduce male sexual function and pleasure. 'Yet the highest-quality studies suggest that medical male circumcision has no adverse effect on sexual function, sensitivity, sexual sensation, or satisfaction.' He and his co-researcher John Krieger . looked at 36 studies totalling 40,473 men - half of were circumcised . and half were not. Each of the studies was graded in terms of quality, . according to official guidelines. Male circumcision prevalence in 2007: Yellow is lower than 20%, orange is 20-80% and red is higher than 80% . The professors found that the very . high quality studies reported circumcision 'had no overall adverse . effect on penile sensitivity, sexual arousal, sexual sensation, erectile . function, premature ejaculation, duration of intercourse, orgasm . difficulties, sexual satisfaction, pleasure, or pain during . penetration.' In contrast, the studies which find negative effects were poor quality, Dr Morris said. He added: 'The methodology was impeccable - it searched all of the conventional . publication databases to retrieve all research articles containing . relevant data. It then ranked these by quality according to the . conventional guidelines.' The study, published in the Journal of Sexual Medicine, discusses large studies to back up the findings. One high-quality trial of nearly 3,000 . sexually experienced men in Kenya involved them completing a . questionnaire at six-monthly intervals up to 24 months after they were . circumcised. Circumcision lowers rates of penile cancer and possibly prostate cancer - and women whose partners are circumcised have lower rates of cervical cancer and infections such as HPV (pictured) and chlamydia . At each time point, there were no significant differences in sexual performance or satisfaction in men who were circumcised and those who weren't. At 24 months, 99.9 per cent of men were satisfied with their circumcisions. In fact, 72 per cent of men said sensitivity had increased and 19 per cent said it was the same. Ease of reaching orgasm was greater in 63 per cent and the same in 22 per cent. Another large trial, involving 2,250 Ugandan men, found no difference in sexual desire or difficulty in achieving or maintaining an erection.  A year after circumcision, 99 per cent reported being sexually satisfied. However the authors concede that circumcision for medical reasons may be linked with problems in the bedroom. They mention an Australian study which found that men circumcised after infancy for medical reasons were less likely to want sex.","Australian scientists analysed nearly 40 studies and concluded that the procedure had 'no effect on sensitivity or satisfaction'

During the press call, the spokesman also said that Clinton plans 'at some point' to appear before Congress to testify on the Sept. 11, 2012 attack on the U.S. mission in Benghazi, Libya. 'She is committed to testifying, and we are working with the committees on an appropriate set of dates,' Nuland said. The Secretary of State's illness has prevented her from appearing before the committee in Washington, which was become a point of contention among detractors.

Manhattan yesterday. Wearing a black puffy coat to brave . the chilly New York temperatures, Chelsea appeared self-assured as her . mother leaned on her for support. There was initially confusion on Wednesday afternoon about whether . Secretary Clinton's appearance outside the hospital meant that she had been discharged but later in the evening, the Clinton's daughter confirmed that her mother had indeed been released. 'Grateful my Mom discharged from the . hospital & is heading home. Even more grateful her medical team . confident she'll make a full recovery,' she tweeted.

Recovering: Hillary Clinton was driven . to a medical facility across the street from the hospital on Wednesday for tests and then officially discharged . Back to work: Secretary of State Hillary Clinton grins widely as she is driven away from New York-Presbyterian Hospital. She is already actively engaging with her staff, a spokesperson said . The Clintons . bought the home, located only a 40-minute drive outside of Manhattan, . in 1999 and have used it as their primary residence for much of the last . decade.

A New Castle Police Officer said that . members of the media are not allowed to park on the road that leads to . the Clinton home, according to the Chappaqua-Mount Kisco Patch. 'Please let her recover as quickly as possible but without paparazzi,' one local resident Nora Mackenzie commented on the local news website.

Home to rest: The Clintons purchased this home in the New York suburb of Chappaqua in 1999 for $1.7million . Her short public appearance on . Wednesday seemed to signal that she was ready to get back to work . following an unspecified recovery period, though some detractors . suggested her health condition could keep her out of the running for a . rumored presidential bid in 2016. Others . scoffed that perhaps the outgoing Secretary of State was using her . health scare to avoid facing a Congressional inquiry on State Department . security failures in the September 11 attack on the U.S. Consulate in . Benghazi. She was admitted to the hospital on Sunday after an MRI revealed the . clot. According to BuzzFeed, a hospital source said that she received treatment in a VIP wing on the hospital's ninth floor. Her doctors announced that she was . being treated for the condition on Monday, causing alarm over the . secretary's health following a concussion she suffered from a fall on . December 9. In the . Monday statement, Dr. Lisa Bardack, of the Mt. Kisco Medical Group, and . Dr. Gigi El-Bayoumi, from George Washington University, said the clot . 'did not result in a stroke, or neurological damage.' Despite . the assurances, people became alarmed when a photo emerged of Chelsea Clinton looking distraught and anxious as she visited her mother at . the hospital on Monday. Early on: Chelsea Clinton looked distressed on Monday while visiting her mother (pictured) but by Wednesday the 32-year-old appeared more upbeat as she supported her mother . Chelsea, who is married to investment banker Marc Mezvinsky and lives in the Madison Square Park neighborhood of Manhattan, is extremely close to her family. In a Vogue profile of Chelsea, who entered the limelight in 1993 when her father became president, a friend of the Clinton's only child said the loss of her maternal grandmother, Dorothy Rodham, last year came as a devastating blow. Her childhood friend, Nicole Fox, said in August 2012 that death of her mother's mother 'was the hardest thing I’ve ever seen Chelsea . go through. She was really destroyed by it.' But after the pained expression on Monday, Chelsea Clinton displayed more optimism in a New Year's Day message. 'Wishing . all a healthy & happy 2013,' Chelsea Clinton tweeted on Tuesday. 'Grateful to be starting the new year with my family.' Relief: Chelsea tweeted that her mother was formally discharged on Wednesday evening . Health scare: Hillary Clinton's doctors discovered the clot during a follow-up exam on Sunday and confirmed it was in her head on Monday . Clinton also thanked the public via Twitter for their support for her mother. 'Thank you to all for sending good thoughts my Mom's way,' she wrote. 'Grateful to all her doctors & that she'll make a full recovery!' Chelsea Clinton has always enjoyed a close relationship with her parents and is increasingly becoming a political force in her own right. She was a fixture during her mother's bid for the Democratic  presidential nomination in 2008 and has not been shying away from the spotlight with speaking engagements, her gig as a correspondent for NBC and her political advocacy for LGBT issues. But for now, the poised and glamorous scholar is committed to being by her mother's side. Grateful: Chelsea tweeted from her mother's bedside on New Year's Day . Optimism: Chelsea also thanked the public via Twitter for their support while her mother is hospitalized . Former President Bill Clinton had also been spotted driving to and from his . wife's side at New York-Presbyterian Hospital during his wife's stay at the hospital. In . the Monday statement announcing Clinton's condition, doctors assured . the public that it was not a life-threatening condition and said she had . suffered no brain damage or stroke. 'In all other aspects of her recovery, the Secretary is making . excellent progress and we are confident she will make a full recovery. She is in good spirits, engaging with her doctors, her family, and her . staff,' Doctors Lisa Bardack and Gigi El-Bayoumi said in a statement. A clot occurs when a blockage builds . up, either from partial thrombus (coagulated blood) or an outside . compression. When the vein becomes blocked, the coagulated blood may . extend to veins draining the area, which could lead to a lack of oxygen . and tissue death. The condition was discovered during an MRI but leading up to the discovery.","Hillary Clinton, 65, left New York-Presbyterian Hospital looking relaxed with daughter Chelsea and husband Bill by her side on Wednesday .

"Car giant Audi employed thousands of concentration camp inmates during the Second World War and was 'firmly ensnared' in the Nazi regime, an investigation has found. During the war years Audi was known as Group Auto Union and, in a deal brokered by the SS, hired 3,700 concentration camp inmates to work . in what was then Germany’s second biggest car firm. The academic study also revealed another 16,500 forced laborers, who were not imprisoned in concentration camps, were working in Auto Union plants. Dark history: Car giant Audi, then called Auto Union, employed thousands of concentration camp inmates during the Second World War, an investigation has found . Authors of the study, economic historian Rudolf Boch of the University of Chemnitz, and Martin Kukowski, head of the Department of history at Audi, were granted access to the Audi archives for the first time for their 'house cleaning' history of the firm. Their book, Wartime Economy And Labour Usage Of Auto Union Chemnitz AG During The Second World War, centres on the firm, which was the only serious competitor to Mercedes during the 12 year lifespan of the Third Reich, with a 20 percent market share for luxury cars. During the war some of the plants were turned over to military production, churning out tanks and air-craft engines. The 500 page report claims that Auto Union - now Volkswagen’s luxury marque Audi - built its success on the back of human misery and suffering, and that founder Dr Richard Bruhn was largely  responsible for the firm's large-scale exploitation of forced labour. 'More than 20,000 forced laborers were used in the production of Auto Union in their Saxon works, including almost one-fifth from concentration camps,' said the study authors. Production: During the war some of the plants were turned over to military production, churning out tanks and air-craft engines . Conditions in the concentration camp in the city of Zwickau, where many workers were held, were particularly appalling with 1,000 prisoners - many of them forced labourers from France - living in unheated barracks. 'The conditions were devastating,' said the historians. The researchers also discovered that disabled workers were shipped north to the Flossenburg concentration camp to be executed, and their numbers replaced with prisoners from that camp. Towards the end of the war, 688 Zwickau inmates were sent on a death march to Karlovy Vary, now in the Czech Republic, with almost half of them dying on the way. Audi recognised its wartime guilt in using forced labour more a decade ago, paying massive amounts into the £3billion fund which German industry set up to compensate Nazi slave workers and their descendants. The company was founded in 1932 following a merger of four car makers, and dropped the Auto Union name after a further merger in 1985. It is the last of the large German car makers to commission a study into its wartime past, with Volkswagen, Daimler and BMW already having done so.","Firm hired 3,700 concentration camp inmates in deal brokered by the SS .

"A crash on a Chicago highway has sent a 4-year-old boy flying through the rear window, but police say the child's father who was behind the wheel was too drunk to notice. Franklin Jackson, 46, of Texas, has been charged in connection to his toddler son's death Sunday on Day Ryan Expressway in Chicago. According to Illinois State Police, Mr Jackson was heading north on the highway with his wife and four young children at around 4.20pm Sunday when he smashed his Ford Expedition SUV into a guardrail twice. Bad dad: Franklin Jackson (left), 46, of Texas, has been charged in connection to the death of his 4-year-old son (right), who was ejected from the family SUV through the rear window without his drunken father even noticing . Franklin Jr was ejected from the vehicle on impact, landing on a grass-covered embankment near the 87th Street exit. The . toddler's father reportedly didn't realize his son was not in the car . until he pulled into a gas station four exits away to check on the . damage to his SUV, Chicago Tribune reported. Meanwhile, the 4-year-old was rushed to Comer Children's Hospital, where he was pronounced dead at 5.25pm. The Cook County Medical Examiner’s Office determined that the boy died from head trauma.

According to Prosecutor Maura White, six hours after the crash Franklin's blood alcohol level was .04 per cent, which is below the legal limit, Chicago Sun-Times reported. But forensic experts estimated that at the time of the collision, his blood alcohol level was between .11 and .15 per cent – nearly twice the legal limit. Jackson's wife, Linda Bassett, posted a message on her Facebook page Saturday telling her friends how excited she was about traveling to Chicago to visit her family for the holidays. 'Chicago here we come,' the woman gushed. 'Will be there soon.' Earlier that day, however, the 23-year-old mother of four expressed some concerns about taking the 1,110-mile trip up north. 'Heavenly farther I pray that you watch over me n[sic] my family on this long trip to Chicago,' she wrote. In response to a friend's comment about the 17-hour road trip, Miss Bassett promised to be 'very careful.'","Franklin Jackson Jr, 4, died from head trauma an hour after being thrown from car .

"Shaped like a heart - and with two hands clasped together in decorative sleeves at its base - this piece of jewellery may be tiny but it was to prove an enormous find for one lucky metal detector enthusiast. Stan Cooper, 60, unearthed the 2.5cm gold brooch beneath the soil in a farmer's field near Sandbach, Cheshire - and was initially unaware of its true provenance. But the item - no bigger than a pound coin - has now been dated to between 1350 and 1450 and is thought to have originally been a betrothal gift because the hands appear to be male and female. Furthermore, it is worth an astonishing £25,000. A metal detector enthusiast who found a 2.5cm gold brooch in a farmer's field is celebrating after it was identified as a medieval piece of jewellery worth £25,000 . Stan Cooper, 60, discovered the treasure near Sandbach, Cheshire . Experts said it is rare to have a brooch containing the heart and clasped hands together on one piece. Bill Forrest from Adam Partridge auctioneers in Macclesfield, Cheshire, which is selling the brooch, said: 'It is an annular-style brooch that combines two symbols; a heart and hands clasped. 'It . is rare to find these two symbols together on one brooch and it really . is such a fine thing that a jeweller today would struggle to make it. 'The hands are slightly different, meaning they might be a man and a woman’s hand - and they are in sleeves, which are decorated. 'It . was probably a betrothal gift from a gentleman to his other half and . would originally have belonged to someone of very high standing. The brooch has been dated to between 1350 and 1450 and is in the shape of a heart with two clasped hands. The size of a pound coin, it is thought it was originally a betrothal gift because the hands appear to be male and female . 'It will be of interest to brooch collectors and those who collect medieval jewellery.' Mr Cooper made the discovery last June and described it as a 'find of a lifetime'. He was not sure what it was at first because it was covered in . dirt, but after it was cleaned, he realised it was gold. Mr Cooper, who is a works manager for a manufacturing company, has been detecting for over 20 years and will share any proceeds with the farmer . Incredibly, the jewellery appears to be in perfect condition despite having lain underground for hundreds of years. The brooch was reported to the authorities and then sent to the British Museum for experts to examine. And because the Crown disclaimed it, there was no need for a treasure trove inquest and it is free to be sold. Mr Cooper, who is a works manager for a manufacturing company, has been detecting for over 20 years and will share any proceeds with the farmer. The grandfather, who lives near to the site of his find, said: 'I got permission to dig on the farm in May last year. 'In other fields, I found copper coinage and musket balls, then I selected a field that had a stream running through it. 'I was about eight feet from the stream when I got a good signal and I decided to dig it. 'The brooch was only about four or five inches down and it was covered in dirt, but I could see that it was a precious metal. 'There was so much dirt that the pin wouldn’t swing so I put it in a polythene bag and took it to a friend’s house where we put it in an ultrasonic cleaner. 'When it came out after about ten minutes I could tell it was quality gold because it gleaned as if it had been polished. 'It had detail on both sides and the workmanship made me think it was earlier than Victorian. 'It really was the find of a lifetime. You have two weeks after making a find before you have to declare it so I did a bit of research. 'It is unusual to have the clasped hands and heart together in one piece - the clasped hands are something you find from Roman times.' Mr Forrest added: 'It is really exciting. 'It was found on June 11 last year by a metal detectorist in the Sandbach area. 'We can’t give out any more details of the location for obvious reasons. 'It was brought in to us by the finder for an insurance valuation and after some research came up with a valuation. 'It was then sent to the British Museum so it could be examined, authenticated and documented. 'It was disclaimed by the Crown so there was no need for an inquest and it can now be sold.'","Jewellery unearthed near Sandbach, Cheshire is the size of £1 coin ."

New home: Biggie (above with Dr. Nichole Agarwal), a 37-pound cat, has been adopted by the staff at Riverside Cat Hospital . One fat cat: The cat grew obese after his owner, who worked long hours, left him with too much food . 'As a vet, I have never heard of a cat this heavy,' the hospital's veterinarian, Dr. Nichole Agarwal, told the Los Angeles Times. A normal cat, she explained, weighs around 12 pounds. Biggie's former owner was frequently working and, not wanting her precious feline to want for anything while she was away, she overfed the cat, leading to Biggie's current obesity problem. The cat has trouble breathing, is constipated and, even worse, does not purr or meow, which is a sign of stress. He is also in so much pain he requires painkillers. Nursing him back to health: The staff if hoping that with exercise and a diet high in protein, Biggie can get healthy . Backed up: As seen in this x-ray, the cat is also extremely constipated . That being said, Dr. Agarwal says the cat moves remarkably well given his weight issues and, with a new diet that is heavy on protein and some serious exercise, she is hoping to save Biggie's life. It will however be an uphill battle, as most cats who weigh over 30 pounds are never able to bounce back. Here's hoping Biggie can prove them all wrong.","An animal hospital in Riverside, California, has adopted a 37-pound cat after his owner wanted to have him put down .

"North Korea has banned workers from being paid bonuses in Choco Pies after their popularity sparked a black market trade in the chocolate biscuits, it has been reported. North Korean employees of South Korean companies at the joint Kaesong Industrial Complex, in North Korea, were used to receiving the marshmallow and chocolate treats, similar to Wagon Wheels, as a form of payment. But they have now been told they will receive foods such as sausages, instant noodles, powdered coffee and chocolate instead. North Korea has banned workers from being paid Choco Pies as bonuses . North Korean officials told employers to stop handing the biscuits out last month, the Seoul-based newspaper Chosun Ilbo has reported. The biscuits became popular among North Korean workers after South Korean companies were banned from paying them bonuses in money and so opted to give them the treats instead. The chocolate biscuits would however be taken back to Pyongyang and sold for substantial amounts on the black market. Last year it was reported that when Pyongyang closed the Kaesong Industrial Complex, amid heightened tensions in the region, black market values of the biscuits soared, with some changing hands for up to £14. In North Korea, the black market for capitalist products is highly illegal, but thriving. North Korean workers at the Kaeson industrial park were used to receiving the marshmallow and chocolate treats, similar to Wagon Wheels, as a form of payment . It is believed the North was first introduced to the confectionery via the Kaesong Industrial Complex - where 100 South Korean factory owners employ about 50,000 North Korean labourers . North Korea suffered a crippling famine in the 1990s that killed an estimated one million people, and it has struggled with food production since. Previously, food such as pizzas, hamburgers and french fries were banned from the North. Choco-Pies have even been sent to North Korea in balloons by advocacy groups.","North Korean employees had been used to receiving the biscuits as bonuses .

"An armless man who steered his car with his feet has had his car confiscated to stop him driving because it’s ‘too dangerous’ – though he’d already clocked up 100,000 miles behind the wheel. Police in China said Wo Guo, 45, was a danger to himself and other road users. He was pulled over in a routine road traffic check in Xiantao city in central China’s Hubei province, where officers found he did not have a licence. Toe-tally incredible: Wo Guo has driven 100,000 miles using his feet . Banned: Mr Guo has had his car confiscated by police in China . He used his feet to drive the car. He used the big toe and the toe beside it on the left foot to control the steering wheel and used the right foot to control the brake. According to the armless motorist he has clocked up 100,000 miles without mishap. Guo lost his arms at the age of seven when he went to cut grass to feed a horse, and accidentally touched high voltage wires with his scythe. Tragedy: Mr Guo had his arms ampuated at the age of seven after touching high voltage wires with a scythe . Crucial: Mr Guo says he needs a car to sell fruit . After his arms were amputated he learned to wash his face and brush his teeth, write and to sew using his feet. He is married, has a son who is at college, makes a living selling fruit and says he has a ‘happy life.’ But he says he needs his car to make deliveries: ‘I don't find driving automatic cars hard. My friend taught me to drive within a week, but I can't get a licence because of my disability so I do it in secret. A police spokesman said that he would not be fined and he would get his car back if he hired a driver, adding: ‘He is admirable, but it’s too dangerous for him to drive. I hope he can give up driving himself and employ someone else.’","Police in China caught armless Wo Guo, 45, driving with his feet .

"Arsenal players were put through their paces by Arsene Wenger on Saturday as they looked to put an unsatisfactory week behind them with victory against Everton.

Sanchez will be looking to lead his team back to victory after a disappointing Champions League defeat . Jack Wilshere will be absent after he had a minor operation on his ankle, but other than that Wenger insists he has no extra injury concerns after Wednesday's defeat. Aaron Ramsey and Mathieu Flamini could also return to action soon. Wenger is open to embracing change and can turn the team into an effective defensive force again, according to former Double winner Bob Wilson. The manner of the performance against Monaco - which saw Arsenal punished on the break for what Wenger himself described as 'suicidal defending' - drew plenty of negative headlines and debate across social media, with Wilson calling for support of the manager and unity behind the team. Wilson, who was in goal when Arsenal battled to the 1970/71 Championship and FA Cup success, believes Wenger still has what it takes to find the balance needed to blend the attack-minded squad into an effective unit.

'I believe this squad has the potential to challenge the likes of Chelsea and Man City, for all of their salaries and transfer fees. 'This Arsenal squad are right on the brink. 'Arsene Wenger has assembled a squad which is now nearly perfect, there are virtually two players in every position and going forwards they have an embarrassment of riches. 'We just have to make sure victory is based on good defence. 'Arsene's principles are to always entertain and play this beautiful football to watch, but you need to make sure your defence is always secure, and that involves everybody from the goalkeeper out, so as soon as you lose possession every one of you becomes a defender immediately and have to win the ball back.'

"It is the most famous ship in the world and the tale of its doomed maiden voyage has spawned countless books, blogs and one of the most lucrative films in history. But a unique project to colour original black and white images has shown The Titanic in a different light. Russian photo editor Anton Logvynenko has breathed new life into the story of the iconic ship by painstakingly colouring in the photographs. Majestic: New life has been breathed into The Titanic by photo editor Anton Logvynenko who painstakingly coloured in black and white images of the doomed ship . Impressive: The liner has been authentically coloured in Mr Logvynenko's project that he started to commemorate the 100th anniversary of its sinking . Start to finish: Mr Logvynenko's coloured images show the Titanic under construction in the gantry  (right) to the finished deck . Awesome: The photo editor even coloured in the well-wishers who gathered to wave farewell to The Titanic . Mr Logvynenko took original images and used current technology to give them authentic colour. The project was launched to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the doomed voyage last year but has grown in popularity this month after being shared on a number of blogs. The RMS Titanic was one of the most opulent liners to have ever been built and the largest steamship in the world. It struck an iceberg on its maiden voyage from Southampton, England, to New York City and sank on April 15, 1912. A total of 1,517 people died in the disaster. As well as its tragic end The Titanic is renowned for the luxury on board. Mr Logvynenko's project shows the quality of the interior to amazing effect. The luxurious interior of the ship resembled the contemporary style of leading hotels such The Ritz and the dining rooms were decorated with ornate ceilings and plush carpets. The first class cabins resembled rooms from the finest hotels. Mr . Logvynenko has been able to bring out the sumptuousness of the bedding . and carpets and artistry of the decoration of the first class rooms. Opulence: The luxury of the first class and even second class cabins have been brought to life in Mr Logvynenko's astonishing pictures . Stylish: The Titanic's Cafe Parisien is shown in its original splendour in this coloured photograph where the ivy and ornate ceiling stand out far more than in black and white . Keep fit: Passengers on the luxury liner could enjoy state-of-the-art facilities including a gymnasium (pictured), Turkish bath and telephone . Ornate: Mr Logvnenko chose green and gold decoration to illustrate the opulence of the suites. Tickets for suites would have cost up to £870 in high season (£72,932 today) Expensive: The Titanic's designers wanted their liner to resemble a fine hotel on water with the highest stands of luxury . Dinner time: The dining room, painted here with white walls and green chairs, was a grand room . Among the photographs used in the Titanic In Color series are of a man in fine white sports gear shown on the rowing machine on the liner's gym. Elsewhere, passengers could use a library, visit the barbers or go swimming in the ship's pool. There was also a squash court, Turkish bath and electric bath. A black and white image of the Titanic's Cafe Parisien has also been restored in colour. The table tops of the cafe, that was meant to resemble a sidewalk cafe in Paris, have been coloured in greens, pinks and reds. Ivy growing up the . walls is barely noticeable in the colourless picture but suddenly . stands out in Mr Logvynenko's version. The awesome scale of the ship's construction is also brought to life in the project.

"The district attorney in upscale Nassau County, New York, has unleashed civil strife by posting the names and pictures of 104 men arrested in a prostitution sting over the last six weeks. 'Operation Flush the Johns' on Long Island nabbed young men and old men, lawyers, doctors, engineers, teachers, college professors and students. All of them set up dates to meet with prostitutes at local a hotel using the classified ads site backpage.com. District Attorney Kathleen Rice said police started a sting operation in April after receiving numerous complaints about prostitution at hotels across the county. Wall of shame: District Attorney Kathleen Rice said she hopes that this poster of the 104 men arrested in a prostitution sting will put men on notice that they will be humiliated if they try to buy sex in Nassau County . It's unknown how many of the men arrested were married and whether any of their spouses had to wait until the public release of information today to learn of their infidelity. Nassau divorce lawyer Bryan L. Salamone says he has had four women come . to him seeking divorces because their husbands were charged with . soliciting prostitutes. About 20percent of marriages where a wife finds out her husband has been cheating - with a hooker or otherwise - will end in divorce. Such divorces are usually bitter. 'There’s much more feelings involved. The cases are often high-conflict cases involving a spouse that will now question the husband’s decision-making abilities and wish to limit his access to young children. She may not trust the husband so the spouse will want to freeze assetts and get up-front payment if the husband’s finances may be going to other woman,' Salamone told MailOnline. The other 80percent of men will eventually be forgiven by their wives - often after marriage counseling and significant amounts of contrition. 'But, basically, four out of five guys get away with it,' Salamone says. All walks of life: The arrested men ranged in age from 17 to 79. Several races and nationalities and religious backgrounds were also represented in the arrests of the alleged johns . Most of the suspects are professionals. Several lawyers were arrested. The suspects also include two doctors, two dentists, two engineers, two college professors, two college students, a teacher, a stockbroker and a car salesman. Each man arrived at the hotel after agreeing to meet online with an undercover officer posing as a hooker in the escorts section of backpage.com. The arrested men range in age from 17 to 79. The average age is 40. Most, 79, came from Nassau County and 25 traveled from out of town. Most are professionals. Several lawyers were arrested. The suspects also include two doctors, two dentists, two engineers, two college professors, two college students, a teacher, a stockbroker and a car salesman. Salamone says in his experience, busy professionals who aren't getting enough attention from their wives are more likely to look for extra-marital sex from prostitutes than from a mistress. 'These are people who don’t have the time to go out to court a woman or an affair. They can just hook up very easily and be done,' Salamone says. 'They don’t have to do three dinenr dates and two nights out and explain that to their families.' But, he cautioned, wives often profit handsomely if that affair results in divorce. 'Equitable distribution of assets does not mean equal distribution. The wife doesn’t split everything 5/50, especially if she can prove special circumstances such as a humiliating arrest around the time of a bar mitzvah or graduation,' he said. Prosecuted: Rice said each of the men pictured was arrested after agreeing to meet an undercover officer posing online as a prostitute and then handing over cash at a hotel room . Rice said she released the composite 'wall of shame' because she wanted to put the men who buy prostitutes in Nassau county on notice . District Attorney Kathleen Rice said police started a sting operation in April after receiving numerous complaints about prostitution at hotels across the county . The district attorney in upscale Nassau County, New York, unleashed civil strife by posting the names and pictures of 104 men arrested in a prostitution sting over the last six weeks . Each man arrived at the hotel after agreeing to meet online with an undercover officer posing as a hooker in the escorts section of backpage.com. When the would-be john handed over cash in exchange for sex, officers swooped in and promptly arrested the offender. Each interaction was recorded by hidden cameras and microphones planted in the hotel room. Rice said she released the composite 'wall of shame' because she wanted to put the men who buy prostitutes in Nassau county on notice. 'Not only do people have a right to know who their prosecutors and police are arresting and charging with crimes, but we know that the commission of this specific crime is dramatically affected by the perceived risk of getting caught,' she said. 'We are giving fair warning to johns that the risk is growing rapidly.' But one Nassau County criminal defense lawyer who is representing men arrested in the sting is crying foul. Elliot S. Schlissel told MailOnline that Rice' decided to publicly shame the men who are still legally innocent. 'These people could lose their jobs or marriages or have other problems and never be convicted of anything,' he said. Nassau County District Attorney said that by publicly naming and picturing each of the men arrested, she hopes to made potential johns understand the the risk of being caught and publicly shamed is growing rapidly.

"Vietnam's booming Internet scene is littered with failed start-ups that tried to take on Google and other entrenched U.S web companies. But that's not deterring a newly launched Russian-Vietnamese outfit which believes it can unseat the American search engine in this fast-growing Asian market and also contend with a jittery, authoritarian government seeking to clamp down on freedom of expression online. Like Google rivals elsewhere, Coc Coc, or 'Knock Knock' in English, believes the ubiquitous search engine doesn't get the nuances of the local language. It says its algorithms make for a better, quicker search in Vietnamese, while its local knowledge means the information served will be more relevant - and hence more valuable. Competition: Coc Coc has spent $10million and employed 300 staff at its headquarters in the capital of Vietnam, Hanoi . Fast-growing market: Coc Coc is hoping to unseat American giant Google as Asia's search engine of choice . Coc Coc also flags another possible vulnerability; Google has no office or staff in Vietnam. The company, whose code of conduct includes the phrase 'Don't be evil', is concerned about the liability it faces over content hosted on its servers and having to cooperate with censorship requests by Vietnam's authoritarian, one-party government. Unlike other past hopefuls, Coc Coc is not short of cash. The company has so far spent $10 million, hired 300 staff - including 30 foreigners, mostly Russians - and spread itself out over four floors of a downtown office block in the Vietnamese capital. According to Coc Coc's founders, its investors have $100 million over the next five years to try and get a chunk of the 97 percent of Vietnamese web surfers who currently use Google to switch. They declined to name the investors. 'When I came here, I had some understanding why Vietnam was a good market to beat Google,' said Mikhail Kostin, the company's chief search expert and like others in Coc Coc, a veteran at Russia's largest Internet company, Mail.Ru. 'But after living here for one year, I understand the language and market much more deeply. I'm sure it's right.' Close to a third of Vietnam's 90 million people are online and men and women browsing phones and tablets are a common sight in the cafes of its towns and cities. The country's potential for growth, its young population and good Internet infrastructure have made it an attractive destination for regional and international investors and startups in online content, e-payment and other services. Knock Knock: The firm is contending with an authoritarian government seeking to clamp down on freedom of expression online . Companies, however, have to factor in legal and political uncertainties. Shaken by an explosion in online dissent, the government is drafting laws that would tighten freedom of expression on the Internet and possibly force companies such as Google to keep their servers inside the country. It routinely blocks and filters sensitive sites, sentences bloggers to long jail terms and is alleged to be involved in hacking attacks on websites critical of the ruling party. Patrick Sharbaugh, a lecturer in Asian Internet studies at RMIT International University Vietnam in Ho Chi Minh City, wondered whether Coc Coc might be more willing to censor search results on behalf of the government, something Chinese search engine Baidu does for Beijing. While not as close as they once were, Russia and Vietnam have a special relationship because of their shared ideological history. 'If a player like Coc Coc came in, or Baidu, and said ""hey we are perfectly happy to filter whatever you want us to filter"" and in return they would get preferential treatment from the government, that could put Google in very tough spot,' he said. But there is so far no sign that Coc Coc is prepared to play the role of Hanoi's favorite Internet son. Test searches for politically sensitive terms such as Viet Tan, the overseas pro-democracy group that Hanoi regards as terroristic, were comparable with Google's and didn't hint at censorship. Yet the sensitivities surrounding the topic were apparent when one of Coc Coc's three cofounders, Nguyen Duc Ngoc, was asked whether the company would censor searches if asked. After a minute of silence punctuated by an occasional 'um', Ngoc came up with an example of a search request that might not be honored: someone tapping in 'Ho Chi Minh', the founder of Vietnam's Communist Party and the focus of a state-manicured personality cult, and 'is a dog'. 'A lot of queries like that are made by politically-interested people,' he said. 'Average people are caring about more simple things like how can I find information about my life. In some cases, if they really want to go for that kind of information, we can offer them alternative search engines,' he said, without elaborating. In a statement, Google said it welcomed the competition Coc Coc represented and it hoped to bring more products and services to Vietnam in the future. It said that for the moment it had nothing to announce regarding the opening of an office in the country. Separately, it announced last week that it was launching AdSense, its popular advertising network, in Vietnam. Fledgeling firm: The start-up is hoping to attract a chunk of the 97 per cent of Vietnamese web surfers who currently use Google to search the internet . Google and Baidu were fighting over the search market in China until 2010, when Google shifted its search engine to Hong Kong after a reputation-bruising dispute with Beijing over censorship. Baidu is now the dominant search engine in China. Baidu has a language laboratory in Singapore and is believed to be looking to expand into other Asia markets, but it is not involved in the search market in Vietnam. Anti-Beijing sentiment has left Chinese web companies facing consumer boycotts in Vietnam that make it hard to launch products.

The company's ethos reflects both countries, and in its relaxed office space something of the California-style tech startup: cutoff jeans, laptops on laps, fish tanks, and as per Vietnamese culture, shoes off before you go in. Google dominates search across the globe, but there are a handful of markets in eastern Europe and Asia where it trails local companies, such as Yandex in Russia, Baidu in China and Naver in South Korea. In most cases, the local companies were entrenched before Google entered. Capturing existing market share from the American giant is a far more difficult task.

'Vietnam as a country is a pretty hard place to do business unless you are here. There are a few things that Google can't keep up on.' Coc Coc's hopes lie in the distinctiveness of Vietnamese, which it believes Google doesn't do such a good job with because it hasn't invested in understanding its grammar and syntax. Search engines that can recognize nuanced and complex sentences can deliver better and potentially more valuable search results. Coc Coc believes its large office means it is better placed for marketing, cutting deals with content providers and making its search results more localized. Its camera crews are already filming and photographing streets and logging shops, cafes and businesses - data that will makes search results far richer.

"Rupert Murdoch is being investigated by police over comments he made in a secretly recorded conversation in which he suggests he knew about payments to public officials . Detectives are investigating Rupert Murdoch over comments he made in a secretly recorded conversation in which he suggests he knew about payments to police. The Metropolitan Police is trying to access the tape as part of the Operation Elveden Inquiry into corrupt payments to public officials. Senior officers suspect that the recording ‘may contain evidence of conspiring to commit misconduct in a public office’. Yesterday, Assistant Commissioner . Cressida Dick, who has responsibility for inquiries sparked by the . phone-hacking scandal, told the Home Affairs Committee that officers are . trying to get a copy of the recording and would ‘assess the full . contents of that tape’. The dramatic development came as the Commons media, culture and sport committee revealed it intended to summon the 82-year-old press baron for a second time in the autumn over the comments. In the tapes, Murdoch expresses his fury at ‘incompetent police’ as he tries to placate staff furious at dawn raids at their homes, arrests and criminal charges. In one exchange, the News Corp boss is told that dubious ‘working practices’ at News International went back many years. He says: ‘We’re talking about payments for news tips from cops. That’s been going on a hundred years, absolutely. You didn’t instigate it.’ Critics say the tape shows Murdoch’s real attitude to the crisis, in contrast to the apparent contrition he displayed when giving evidence to MPs two years ago. Commander Neil Basu, who is directly responsible for Operation Weeting, which is investigating the hacking scandal, said he was not surprised by the tape. ‘It would be wrong to say I am surprised to hear the chairman of News International making those comments,’ he said. It emerged that Scotland Yard is resorting to court orders to obtain material from News International after an agreement broke down. The Metropolitan Police is trying to access the tape as part of the Operation Elveden Inquiry into corrupt payments to public officials . The last time: Mr Murdoch memorably addressed the culture select committee in July 2007 . An internal committee set up by the publisher had already handed over millions of emails. The secret recording, broadcast by Channel 4 News, was made during a meeting with journalists from The Sun at their Wapping HQ in March. Murdoch is heard railing at the way the police behaved. ‘It’s a disgrace. Here we are, two years later, and the cops are totally incompetent,’ he said. ‘The idea that the cops then started coming after you, kick you out of bed, and your families, at six in the morning, is unbelievable. ‘But why are the police behaving in this way? It’s the biggest inquiry ever, over next to nothing. And now they’re arresting their own, who never even took money … They’re going to put all newspapers out of business.’ When asked why so much material had been given to police, Murdoch branded it a ‘mistake’ but said a new lawyer had ended the deal, adding: ‘[He] has said ‘No, no, no – get a court order. Deal with that.’ Recording: The mogul was speaking to staff at The Sun at the headquarters of News International . Murdoch went on to reveal how the News of the World kept cash in a safe because: ‘Sometimes the editor needs some on a Saturday night for powerful friends.’ The police inquiry into illegal payments, Operation Elveden, has led to the arrest of 70 people for allegedly making payments to officials. Responding to the Murdoch tapes, a News Corp spokesman said: ‘No other company has done as much to identify what went wrong, compensate the victims, and ensure the same mistakes do not happen again. 'Rupert Murdoch has shown understandable empathy with staff and families affected and will assume they are innocent until and unless proven guilty.’ The spokesman added: 'Mr Murdoch welcomes the opportunity to return to the Select Committee and answer their questions. He looks forward to clearing up any misconceptions as soon as possible.'","Met suspects tape ‘may contain evidence of conspiring to commit misconduct in public office’

"The second fatal victim of the Boston Marathon terror attacks has been identified as a 29-year-old steakhouse manager who went to the race every year. Doctors initially told William Campbell Jr. that his daughter Krystle had survived the bombing. But doctors had mistaken her for her best friend, Karen Rand, because Rand had been carrying Campbell's identification and was in surgery and unable to correct the mistake. Campbell spent 12 hours believing his daughter had survived and only learned the truth after going into the post-operating room and saw Rand lying there instead. 'We had the doctors come out and tell us everything they did (to save Rand) — and it wasn’t our daughter,' Campbell said. Scroll down for video . Victim: Krystle Campbell's parents had believed she survived for 12 hours and only learned she had died after going into the hospital room and finding Miss Rand instead . Krystle went to marathon, which she did every year, and was with Rand, cheering on Rand’s boyfriend. They were struck by the first blast as they waited near the finish line. William Campbell rushed to the hospital and felt relieved when doctors said they were operating on their daughter's leg at Massachusetts General Hospital. But when nurses brought him into a post-operating room around 2 a.m. and saw Rand instead. 'I said, ""That’s not my daughter, that’s Karen! Where’s my daughter?"" The doctors were as shocked as we were,' Campbell said. A Boston detective later showed them a photo of Krystle, who worked as a manager at Jimmy's Steakhouse. 'I almost passed out on the floor,' Campbell said as he was about to view his daughter's body. 'She was the best person you’d ever . meet. She helped everybody,' Campbell said. 'I don’t care who you were, . she was always there.' Krystle was one of the three victims . killed in the two blasts that came just seconds apart. The first victim . identified was eight-year-old Martin Richard. There were 183 people injured in the attack, and 23 people remain in critical condition. As many as 10 people suffered a lost limb, including two children. Heartbreaking mix-up: William Campbell was told his daughter, Krystle, (right), survived but later discovered doctors were actually operating on her friend Karen Rand (left) Heartbroken: Krystle's mother Patty Campbell, center, flanked by her brother, John Reilly, and son, Billy, spoke to reporters outside her home in Medford, Massachusetts on Tuesday and said her daughter had a heart of gold . Mourning: Patty Campbell (top right), mother of Boston Marathon explosion victim Krystle Campbell, told reporters that she couldn't have asked for a better daughter . 'My daughter was the most lovable girl. She helped everybody, and I'm just so shocked right now. We're just . devastated,' he said. 'She was a wonderful, wonderful girl. Always . willing to lend a hand.' Krystle went to watch the Marathon every year, according to Boston.com. Krystle's mother, Patty Campbell, was overwhelmed with grief when she addressed reporters gathered outside her home on in Medford, Massachusetts on Tuesday. 'She had a heart of gold...she was always smiling and friendly,' Patty Campbell said, fighting back tears as she remembered Krystle. 'I couldn't ask for a better daughter. It's hard to believe this is happening. This doesn't make any sense.' Krystle's grandmother Lillian Campbell said she went to the marathon every year 'because she loved people' 'She was the best,' the mother said. 'She’s been doing it since she was a little girl,' said her grandmother, Lillian Campbell. 'She didn’t miss a Marathon, watching it at the finish line. 'She enjoyed doing it because she liked people. She’d meet a lot of people over there. She was very friendly, Krystle. She’d talk to anybody.' Her grandmother added that Krystle had just moved to the town a short time ago. She was living with her grandmother to care for her during an illness for the past couple of years. Lillian said that her granddaughter 'was just beautiful. 'She was fun, outgoing person. She was always there to help somebody. All her friends loved her. 'The family is besides themselves now because something happened to her,' the grandmother said. Tragedy: Krystle Campbell worked as a manager at a steakhouse and was living with her ill grandmother so she could take care of her . Before working at the steakhouse, Krystle was a manager at The Summer Shack. 'The . Summer Shack family is devastated by the loss of our beloved Krystle . Campbell. Please keep her & her family in your thoughts & . prayers,' the popular restaurant Tweeted this afternoon. She attended the University of Massachusetts-Boston and was graduate of Medford High School. Her father had harsh words for whoever carried out the attack. 'I’m very angry. I hope they catch the bastard and fry him,' Campbell said of whoever perpetrated the worst terror attack on U.S. soil since 9/11. 'I can’t understand it — someone doing that. People are out there enjoying a beautiful day and then to have this happen. 'And then the little boy that passed,' he told the New York Daily News, referring to 8-year-old Martin Richard. 'It’s totally tragic.' 'My daughter was the most lovable girl': William Campbell said about his daughter, Krystle, (right), pictured with a friend . The mayor of Medford, Mass., Krystle's hometown, said he had attempted to console her father. 'Mr. Campbell said that she certainly was a dream daughter, the daughter that every father dreams to have and friends of hers said that she was eager about life,' Mayor Michael McGlynn said, according to Reuters. 'She had a great sense of humor and freckles and red hair that brought her right to her Irish roots. She was someone who worked hard at everything she did.' McGlynn said. 'Another friend said she may have been a little loud at times but it was a loudness you loved.' A former colleague of Krystle's, Steve Sullivan of Pembroke, MA, told BuzzFeed that Krystle was 'a beautiful person' and 'an angel.' 'Whenever I saw her she always had a smile on her face.' Campbell's death was reported as authorities released further information about the type of bombs used in the attack. The two bombs were made from six-liter pressure cookers crammed with shards of metal, nails and ball bearings and stashed in black backpacks, police sources revealed today. The cruelly-designed bombs have 'frequently' been used in Afghanistan, India, Nepal and Pakistan, according to a 2010 Homeland Security Department pamphlet - hinting at the origins of the bombers behind the worst terrorist atrocity in the U.S. since 9/11. When the devices exploded near the crowded Boston Marathon finish line around 2:50pm on Monday, victims suffered as many as 40 shrapnel wounds each and at least 10 people needed amputations. Witnesses described seeing body parts flying through the air and shoes that 'still had flesh in them.' Fatal victim Martin Richard's younger sister, Jane, lost a . leg in the explosion and his mother Denise is in hospital after . undergoing brain surgery.

"The moment a flaming meteorite shot across the British night sky has been captured by a police car. Stunned traffic officers spotted the ‘bolide’ meteor as they travelled on the M42 in the West Midlands at 03:00 BST on Monday. The clip released by West Midlands Police shows the bright white flash of light hurtling across the sky in front on their vehicle. The video was taken from a camera on the front of one of the force’s traffic cars as it left Junction 4 of the motorway near Shirley. Posting the footage on their Twitter account, West Midlands Police said: 'We’re used to catching suspects on camera but on Mon we recorded this meteor fireball in the sky over @m42motorway.' There is no official definition of a bolide, but it is generally taken to be a fireball. It comes from the Greek 'bolis', which means missile. Particularly . bright meteors, such as the one spotted in the UK today, that burn up . in the atmosphere are generally regarded as bolides. Fireballs that explode in the upper atmosphere are also known as bolides. Bolides that reach exceptional brightness are known as superbolides. Experts said the meteor was spotted over the West Country, Wales and the West Midlands in the early hours of Monday morning. The rock broke into pieces as it entered the earth’s atmosphere but did not cause any damage. Spotting meteors like this is rare in the UK and astronomers said catching one on camera is a huge achievement. The incredible sight was also captured by two cameras operated by the Norman Lockyer Observatory in Sidmoth, Devon. This is the moment a flaming meteorite was captured shooting across the British night sky - from a camera in a police car. The meteorite is visible at about the 12.30 position in this image. Stunned traffic officers spotted the 'bolide' meteor as they travelled on the M42 in the West Midlands at 03:00 BST on Monday . Posting the footage on their Twitter account, West Midlands Police said: 'We're used to catching suspects on camera but on Mon we recorded this meteor fireball in the sky over @m42motorway' The ten-second clip released by West Midlands Police shows the bright white flash of light hurtling across the sky in front on their vehicle.  The video was taken from a camera on the front of one of the force's traffic cars as it left Junction 4 of the M42 motorway near Shirley . Dave Jones, of the UK Meteor Observation Network, said it was by far the largest fireball ever spotted by the observatory. He added: 'We have two cameras that watch for meteors during darkness, so upon hearing the news I logged in to check our data and see if we had captured anything. 'Fortunately the meteor passed in front of both of our cameras so we ended up with two videos of the same event. 'Due to cloud and raindrops on the camera lenses the image was not as clear as we would like, however the sheer size and brightness of this object burning up in our atmosphere almost overwhelmed our cameras as it was so bright.' The dashcam video was taken from a camera on the front of one of the force's traffic cars as it left Junction 4 of the M42 motorway near Shirley in the early hours of Monday morning . The discovery was first made by cameras at the Norman Lockyer Observatory in Sidmouth, Devon at 03:04 BST on Monday. Events such as this in the UK are rare, so spotting one on camera is a huge achievement. Some eyewitnesses are reported to have said it was green in colour, and it was said to even cast shadows due to its brightness. Astronomers at the Norman Lockyer Observatory in Sidmouth heard reports that a massive shooting star had been spotted streaking across the sky in the early hours. They rewound the observatory’s two fixed cameras and were thrilled to find a perfect clip of a flaming meteor arcing across the sky at 3:04 before disappearing behind clouds. Built in 1912 and situated 15 miles south of Exeter, the Norman Lockyer Observatory is used by students, researchers and amateur astronomers. Thanks to its coastal location and the lack of light pollution, it is renowned as one of the best places in the UK for spectral analysis. A meteor has been spotted streaking over skies of the UK. It was caught on two camera operated by the Norman Lockyer Observatory in Sidmoth, Devon, shown here in this still from a video. It did not cause any damage but shows how vulnerable our planet can be to space rocks such as asteroids and comets . This meteor comes on the 106th anniversary of the Tunguska event. On 30 June 1908 a giant explosion occurred over the Tunguska River in Russia, believed to have been caused by an asteroid or comet exploding in the atmosphere. It flattened 770 square miles (2,000 square kilometres) of forest (picture taken in 1929) Meteors that enter our atmosphere often undergo this intense event as they are heated during re-entry. On occasion rocks make it all the way through and impact the ground, forming craters. More often than not though the debris merely burns up in the atmosphere, in some cases as a super-heated fireball known as a bolide. Some even explode in the upper atmosphere and, if they’re big enough, can cause widespread damage like the Tunguska event 106 years ago. On . 30 June 1908 a giant explosion occurred over the Tunguska River in . Russia, believed to have been caused by an asteroid or comet exploding . in the atmosphere. The Tunguska event, as it would be known, flattened 770 square miles (2,000 square kilometres) of forest. And . on its 106th anniversary the UK has experienced a Tunguska event of its . own, albeit on a much smaller scale. An asteroid is a large chunk of rock left over from collisions or the early solar system. Most are located between Mars and Jupiter in the Main Belt. A comet is a rock covered in ice, methane and other compounds. Their orbits take them much further out of the solar system. A meteor is what we call a flash of light in the atmosphere when debris burns up. This debris itself is known as a meteoroid. Most are so small they are vapourised in the atmosphere. If any of this meteoroid makes it to Earth, it is called a meteorite. Meteors, meteoroids and meteorites normally originate from asteroids and comets.","New footage of the meteor that streaked across the UK has been revealed .

"The race is on to build a self-driving car that can negotiate difficult driving conditions, with auto manufacturers trialling a number of different technologies. And now BMW has revealed it is testing autonomous cars that can slide round corners at high speeds, with the sort of precision it takes racing drivers years to perfect. The German car company’s new prototype . cars use ‘advanced technology to demonstrate maximum safety up to the . car’s dynamic limit,’ by enabling them to negotiate turns and obstacles . at high speeds. BMW has revealed it is testing autonomous cars that can slide round corners - or 'drift' - at high speeds, with the precision it takes racing driver years to perfect . BMW showed off a modified 2-Series Coupe and 6-Series Gran Coupe sporting its latest technology, at the 2014 Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. Both cars are fitted with a Lidar system - a remote sensing technology that measures distance by illuminating a target with a laser and analysing the reflected light - 360 degree radar, ultrasonic sensors and cameras that track the environment, enabling them to make driving decisions. BMW showed off a modified 2-Series Coupe (pictured right) and 6-Series Gran Coupe (pictured left) sporting its latest technology, at the 2014 Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas . Sensors monitoring road conditions as well as picking up other data feed information to the car's computer so that it can make autonomous decisions. Understeer – where the car pushes over its front wheels – is controlled by ‘opening’ the steering and a sliding rear end (oversteer, which is used to drift) is caught using a carefully gauged combination of countersteering and brake inputs. This allows a driver to slide around a corner at speed but also in safety. The programmable electronic steering required to make this possible carries out carefully targeted and rapid adjustments such as braking at the perfect time. These technologies, coupled with electric braking, throttle and steering control that comes with all new BMWs, means that the cars can change lanes, slide round corners and even perform a slalom at high speeds without any intervention from the driver. BMW said: ‘The prototype can pilot its way at high speeds and with exceptional precision on a slalom run between cones, adheres to a marked out circular course regardless of the friction coefficient of the road surface and executes an obstacle-evading lane change to perfection.’ The fact that the cars are able to ‘drift’ by themselves has excited motoring enthusiasts, as it is a tricky technique used by professional drivers who intentionally oversteer so that the rear tyres slip but they maintain control of the car. This move enables them to take corners quickly and efficiently. While the technology will excite would-be racers, it could help people in dangerous driving conditions such as aquaplaning to give a regular driver the skills of an expert. Here a demonstrator keeps his hands on his lap as the car takes a corner at high speed . The fact that the cars are able to 'drift' by themselves (pictured) has excited motoring enthusiasts, as it is a tricky technique used by professional drivers who intentionally oversteer so that the rear tyres slip but they maintain control of the car to take corners quickly . ‘Even when deliberately provoked into oversteer – the clearest way of highlighting a vehicle’s dynamic limit – the highly automated prototype follows its path safely and along almost identical lines time after time,’ the car company said. While the technology will excite would-be racers, it could help people in dangerous driving conditions off the track. It would give a regular driver the skills of an expert when aquaplaning, for example. The cars constantly factor in the condition of a road surface to respond intelligently and BMW has tested them on the famous Nürburgring circuit. Look, no hands! The new autonomous technologies, coupled with electric braking throttle and steering control that comes with all new BMWs, means that the cars can change lanes, slide round corners and even perform a slalom at high speeds without any intervention from the driver . The intelligent systems actively intervene in the direction-changing, decision-making process and BMW says its technology goes ‘a crucial step further than current systems’ that which react to the onset of understeer or oversteer with carefully calculated braking inputs, to keep drivers safely on the road. BMW is testing the high-speed autonomous system as it believes only one that can master all driving situations will gain the trust of the public.

"A second British hostage ISIS fanatics are threatening to murder can today be revealed as a taxi driver who travelled to Syria to help refugees. Islamic militants warned in a chilling video that 47-year-old Alan Henning - who is originally from the Greater Manchester area - would be the next person to die after father-of-two David Haines. Mr Henning is believed to have been working for a Muslim charity and had originally thought that he would be released by ISIS because he was only in Syria to carry out aid work.

Prime Minister David Cameron today held emergency talks with senior representatives of the military, security services, the Foreign Office and the Home Office over Mr Haines's murder. 'Whatever steps are necessary': Prime Minister David Cameron today held emergency talks with senior representatives of the military, security services, the Foreign Office and the Home Office . But Government sources indicated that the death of Mr Haines, 44, would not change Britain's policy and Parliament would not be recalled to discuss the grim development. Mr Cameron said Britain stands ready to take ‘whatever steps are necessary’ to help an international push to destroy the ‘evil’ extremist group who murdered Mr Haines. He hailed Mr Haines - who was captured in Syria in March 2013 - as a ‘British hero’ and vowed to ‘hunt down those responsible and bring them to justice no matter how long it takes.’ Islamic State were ‘not Muslims they are monsters’, he said, and added that the UK could not afford to ignore the severe threat the jihadists' spread posed to both world and domestic security. Mr Cameron said the UK would seek to 'mobilise the broadest possible support to bear down' on ISIS at the UN as efforts continue to form a coalition of countries to take part in a concerted offensive.

He dedicated his life to promoting peace in places of violent conflict and oversaw projects to save civilians from land mines.

He had a teenage daughter in Scotland from a previous marriage with his first wife, and a four-year-old daughter, Athea, in Croatia from his second wife. Mr Haines was born in Holderness in East Yorkshire and brought up in Perth by his parents Herbert, 77, and Mary, 79, who now live in Ayr. He studied at Perth Academy before joining the military aged 17. According to his online CV he spent 11 years in the military, holding 'various positions covering security and threat assessments in a number of different countries' between 1988 and 1999. It did not specify with which armed forces he served, although the Islamic State video claimed he had been in the Royal Air Force. His brother Mike later confirmed this, saying he was an engineer. Despite getting married to his first wife when he was 22 – and having his first daughter five years later – Mr Haines was determined to continue working across the world to help civilians trapped in war-torn countries. Scroll down for video . RAF engineer: Mr Haines spent 11 years in the military, holding 'various positions covering security and threat assessments in a number of different countries' between 1988 and 1999 . The . video was released hours after Mr Haines's family made a direct plea to . his captors to contact them. His second wife, Dragana Prodanovic Haines . (pictured with him), previously said she cried for her husband daily . Between 1999 and 2004, he was at a . German NGO helping to revive abandoned villages and to return refugees . to their homes after the civil war in the former Yugoslavia. The . work led to swift promotion and he left a few years later to become an . independent consultant, spreading his experience in dealing with . security to various charities and organisations. He . worked as a consultant director for manufacturing company Astraea, . based in Croatia, and went to Libya three years ago, working with . Handicap International on demining programmes. The charity said Mr Haines had worked as 'a humanitarian' since 1999, helping people in the Balkans, the Middle East and Africa. Home: The garden of the house where Mr Haines lived with his wife and four-year-old daughter in Sisak, Croatia . Family man: The 44-year-old has a teenage daughter in Scotland and a four-year-old daughter in Croatia . A year later, the aid worker . travelled to South Sudan, where he was a security manager for Nonviolent . Peaceforce, a civilian peacekeeping group. Mr Haines was kidnapped by 'professional' ISIS gunmen on an isolated road in northern Syria in an attack that took just seconds, according to an eyewitness. A Syrian translator, who worked for the same charity as Mr Haines, said they were driving back to Turkey via Aleppo as part of a four-strong group when the militants struck. Travelling in two cars, the masked gunmen ambushed their vehicle, before ordering them to 'get out' and restraining Mr Haines and their Italian colleague Federico Motka. They then threw the pair into the boots of their cars, while one placed a gun to the translator's head and threatened him with death if he told anyone what he had seen. Finally, they shot out the tyres of the victims' car, before driving off with Mr Haines and Mr Motka, who was released by the terror group in May. The group, all of whom worked for the Agency for Technical Cooperation and Development (Acted), had been travelling back from a three-day tour of potential new locations for Syrian refugee camps in March 2013 when they were attacked. They had been taking a shortcut down an isolated farm road near the Atmeh refugee camp and were just miles from the Turkish border, reported The Independent. The camp houses more than 30,000 refugees and is less than a mile from the hilltop of a village. It has become a rallying point for foreign jihadists who have targeted aid workers, journalists and members of the Syrian Free Army. Wanting more freedom and a . shorter-term contract, Mr Haines left to join French non-governmental . organisation ACTED, or the Agency for Technical Cooperation and . Development, which works to support civilians affected by wars, natural . disasters and economic and social crises. Mr Haines met his wife, Dragana . Prodanovic Haines, 45, when she was working as a translator. At the . time, Mr Haines was helping refugees return to their homes after the . Balkans war. The couple ran a . supplies business from their home near Zagreb, where friends said their . relationship was 'a true love story' and they were ecstatic when she . became pregnant with their daughter at the age of 41. The . couple, who married in Croatia in 2010 in a ceremony in which Mr Haines . wore a kilt, were due to celebrate their fourth wedding anniversary in . November. Earlier this month, she described how she 'cries every day' for her husband, but has yet to tell their child of his capture. He was with ACTED in Syria – whom he had . been working for for just ten days - when he was kidnapped with a . colleague, Italian aid worker Federico Motka, 31, in March last year by . IS forces near the Atmeh refugee camp, by the Turkish border. Mr Motka was released in May, after a ransom was paid. Mr Haines's plight came to light at the end of a video showing the beheading of US journalist Steven Sotloff earlier this month. He was being held by a group that included at least one of the British jihadis linked to the kidnap and killing of James Foley and Steven Sotloff, who have been nicknamed 'The Beatles'. Reports from those with connections to the militants said Mr Haines developed vomiting and diarrhoea. He was also said to have been beaten so badly that his kidnappers were forced to arrange medical treatment.","David Haines travelled with aid agencies through Syria, Libya and Sudan .

"Police have identified the man who stabbed a woman and killed his own father with a bow and arrow before killing himself in a senseless act of murder at a central Wyoming community college. Casper Police Chief Chris Walsh said today that Christopher Krumm, 25, of Vernon, Connecticut, first stabbed his dad's girlfriend Heidi Arnold, 42, about two miles southwest of Casper College on Friday morning. Krumm then went to the college and shot his father, 56-year-old computer science instructor James Krumm, in the head with the bow-and-arrow in front of his horrified students. Scroll down for video . Killer: Christopher Krumm, 25, first stabbed his dad's girlfriend before heading to Casper College, where he shot his father with a bow and arrow . Murdered: Christopher Krumm stabbed Heidi Arnold, left, to death before going to Casper College where he shot his father James Krumm, right, through the head with a bow and arrow . On Duty: Police officers responded in full tactical gear to the campus attack at Casper College. No Suspects: Police say they no longer have any suspects, suggesting that the attacker may have been one of the three dead. He then stabbed himself with a large knife. Walsh said the younger Krumm smuggled the weapon into the classroom under a blanket. The classroom killing prompted a . college-wide lockdown as police attempted to ensure that it did not . spiral into yet another campus massacre. Casper Police Chief Chris Walsh said investigators were still trying to determine a motive. Christopher Krumm graduated from the University of Colorado in 2008, where he studied in the school's Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering. Lockdown: Casper College was put on lockdown after apparent bow and arrow attack that left three people dead. 'I want to emphasize that this is a . horrible tragedy,' Walsh said. 'And I want the city to... just feel safe . right now. There is no one at large.' The attack at the two-year community . college in Casper occurred just before 9am in a classroom on the science . building's third floor. All students and staff were evacuated from the . building. The college sent out a campus-wide . alert via text message and email within two minutes of receiving word of . the attack at 9.06am, school spokesman Rich Fujita said. The lockdown . ended at about 11am after school officials received word that police . were no longer searching for a suspect. There are fewer classes on Fridays . than any other day of the week at Casper College, so only between 1,500 . and 2,000 of the college's 5,000 students were there, Fujita added. Tragedy: Students and staff listen to a new conference discussing the apparent murder-suicide on their campus. Political science instructor Chris . Henrichsen said he was showing the film Frost/Nixon to his government . class when he stepped into the hall to get something for a student and . was told a homicide had occurred on campus. He went back to his classroom, where students were getting messages about the campus lockdown on their phones. 'We locked the door and waited for further instruction,' Henrichsen said. The students were later sent home, . but some who parked near a different campus building where the attack . occurred had to leave their cars there, Henrichsen said. About two miles away, Dave Larsen . said he was headed to the gym when he drove past a body in a gutter with . two people standing over it, one talking on a cellphone. Larsen lives about a block from the location of the body, a well-kept neighborhood of mostly single-story houses. Emergency vehicles had the street blocked off on Friday afternoon. Scene: The horrific murder-suicide took place in the science building of the community college . Walsh said 33 law enforcement . officers from different agencies responded to the college after . receiving reports of the attack. He said authorities first thought it . might have been an 'active-shooter-type situation.' 'We quickly contained the building and started a sweep through the building,' he said. Walsh said that within minutes of the . initial call, there was another report of a traumatic injury about two . miles southwest of campus. That victim was found in the street, the . Star-Tribune reported. Classes were canceled for the rest of the day at the school, one of seven community colleges in Wyoming. A meeting was held in the afternoon . for the 150 teachers and students who remained. College president Walt . Nolte addressed them, calling it the worst day of his more than 40 years . in higher education and encouraging the community to come together. 'It is particularly painful because of our size,' Fujita said of the small, tight-knit campus. Counselors were speaking to students and planned to be available through the weekend. About 450 students live on campus. Classes are due to resume on Monday. 'We agreed it doesn't do any good to . just set the students loose. It makes the most sense to have them come . back to campus, where they can get help if they need help and come to . terms with what happened,' Fujita said. Investigation: Police were concerned there could be a gunman at large on the campus or in the town . Walsh said police train for such incidents but had no warning of Friday's violence. Wyoming governor Matt Mead, who went . to the campus on Friday evening, said it was too early to assess . security precautions at the college. 'There's no sense in doing that now until we understand fully what has taken place,' he said. The governor added that the focus now . 'should be on the victims' family, the community college family, the . president, the trustees and the students, and making sure we're . attending to any of their needs.' Casper College opened in 1945 as the . state's first junior college and moved to its current site 10 years . later. The campus consists of 28 buildings on more than 200 acres. The . college provides more than 140 academic-transfer, technical and career . programs. Casper is Wyoming's second-largest . city with a population of about 56,000. Wyoming residents refer to it as . the 'Oil City' because it's a hub for the state's oil industry.

"Arsene Wenger is dreaming of Monaco and that is not entirely down to the romantic notion that he has yet to return in competition to the principality since leaving the club 20 years ago. Monaco, one of six teams Arsenal can be paired with in Monday’s draw for the Champions League last 16, are struggling in the French league after selling James Rodriguez and loaning out Radamel Falcao. Porto is another option he would take ahead of the other four: European champions Real Madrid, German champions Bayern Munich, Spanish champions Atletico Madrid or Barcelona. Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger, pictured with Glenn Hoddle at Monaco in 1987, is keen to play the French side . ‘We’ve never had an easy ride,’ said Wenger, who has been drawn against Bayern at this stage in the last two seasons and, in the two years before that, AC Milan and Barcelona. Arsenal have not been past the last 16 since 2009-10 when they beat Porto before losing in the quarter-finals to Barcelona. ‘I don’t think many teams want Madrid,’ said Wenger. ‘We don’t want Bayern Munich and I’m sure they don’t want us.

Samir Nasri (right) and Nicklas Bendtner celebrate during Arsenal's 2010 victory over Porto - the last time the Gunners advanced from the last 16 stage of the Champions League . ‘I’ve got great memories of Monaco because they gave me a chance when I was a very young manager. ‘When I arrived they had never been past the first round in the European Cup so we have good memories. It is a fantastic place. That would be good.’ Wenger was in charge of Monaco for seven years from 1987, during which time he won the league title and the French Cup. Wenger spent seven years with Monaco and won the league and French  Cup during his time in charge . Arsenal defender Mathieu Debuchy said: ‘It would be great if we could wait a bit for Real Madrid or Barcelona. Monaco would be great.

"A sheriff from Douglas County, Georgia is vehemently apologetic after two teenagers were left locked up in holding cells without food or water for almost three days because 'police forgot they were there.' Sheriff Phil Miller said that the teenagers aged 16 and 17 met with a judge on Friday afternoon and were taken to holding cells to await going back to the youth detention center where they were assigned. Miller said that his deputies didn't notice the teenagers were there so they left for the weekend leaving the teens without food, water, or even toilet paper. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Sheriff Phil Miller says he's embarrassed about his department's failure to properly care for the teenagers left in holding cells without food or water and will do what it takes to make sure it never happens again .

Miller says the fault is that of the department and he is committed to making sure something like this never happens again. 'Nobody that works in security is supposed to leave that building at night without checking the cells, and it's not a hard job to do,' said Miller. Miller told reporters that there is a policy set in place aimed at preventing these mistakes from happening but that deputies failed to follow guidelines. Miller says that there is a color-coded system that alerts deputies as to whether or not a cell is locked. A red light indicates that a cell is locked and that someone is inside. 'We, not following our policy, allowed this to happen and we're wrong,' said Miller. 'We're going to do everything in my power to correct it.' The sheriff said that the teens were found on Monday morning. Other than complaining of hunger they appeared to be in good health. 'Thank God nothing more serious than what happened went wrong,' said Miller. 'If I were the parents or the family of these children, I'd be looking at the sheriff to make sure this never happened again, and I'm going to make sure that it doesn't.' Investigators are questioning deputies and if necessary the responsible parties may be fired.

"Liverpool forward Fabio Borini has defended himself against accusations he has wildly unrealistic expectations after turning down two moves during the transfer window. The Italian rejected both Sunderland, with whom he had a successful loan spell last season, earlier in the summer before turning down QPR in the closing hours of the window on Monday. QPR claimed they were unable to match the 23-year-old's wage demands, with reports suggesting he wanted £90,000-a-week. VIDEO Scroll down to see what Borini spends his wages on . Staying put: Fabio Borini saw a move to QPR collapse on transfer deadline day . That led to criticism of Borini, who will struggle to find a place on the bench at Anfield - never mind get close to the starting line-up - after manager Brendan Rodgers spent £65million on forwards Mario Balotelli, Lazar Markovic and Rickie Lambert. That sum does not include the £10million invested in Divock Origi, who was immediately loaned back to French club Lille. However, former Chelsea trainee Borini has hit back. Reflection: Fabio Borini takes to Twitter to discuss a crazy transfer deadline day for him personally . Proud: Borini says he believes he took control of the situation unlike others . Proud: Borini is happy with the final outcome as he remains a Liverpool player beyond the transfer window . 'Finally the madness is finished!' he wrote on Twitter. 'I protected the MAN and the player that I am today, taking all the responsibility of the situation and for people who didn't want it. 'And I'm VERY happy with myself to have taken such an important decision!' Borini was Rodgers' first signing at Anfield in the summer of 2012, at a cost of £10.5million, having previously worked with him in Chelsea's youth team and during a loan spell at Swansea. However, injuries have dogged his time on Merseyside and he scored just two goals in his maiden season before moving to Sunderland for the 2013-14 season, where he became something of a favourite on Wearside. He scored in both games against arch-rivals Newcastle, including a brilliant winner in the Stadium of Light encounter. Value: Liverpool wanted a return on the £12m they spent on Borini, rather than letting him leave on loan . The Black Cats had a £14million bid accepted by Liverpool in July but Borini rejected a move and, even with his options limited, he refused the escape route offered by QPR after a £10million fee was agreed. While Borini considers what lies ahead for him Rodgers' final summer signing Balotelli will be looking for a long run in the side having made his debut in Sunday's 3-0 win at Tottenham. Defender Jose Enrique made his comeback in that game after nine months out with injury and he is relishing playing alongside the Italy striker. 'Everyone knows that Mario has all the qualities to be one of the best strikers in the world,' he told liverpoolfc.com. 'He knows this is an amazing chance for him at play for Liverpool and I think he's going to do really well. 'During the time he's been with us I've talked with him a lot and inside the dressing room he's been really good. 'Hopefully what we saw on the pitch at Tottenham is what he'll be like all season. He can make a real impact.'","Borini was close to joining both Sunderland and QPR in the transfer window .

"A motorist left devastated when thieves took his beloved sports car has been reunited with it - 33 years later. George Talley, 71, last saw his prized Chevrolet Corvette in 1981 when it was stolen after he parked it on a street.

George Talley is pictured in his prized Chevrolet Corvette after being reunited for with the car 33 years after it was stolen . George Talley, pictured, was told that his Chevrolet Corvette had been found 600 miles away in Mississippi . Despite being missing for more than three decades, the treasured motor had travelled just 47,000 miles extra and was in perfect running order. It had been sitting in a police station in Hattiesburg, Mississippi, the American Automobile Association told him. General Motors, which owns Chevrolet, offered to pick it up and returned it to a delighted Mr Talley this week. He said: 'It was a lucky day to hear that my car had been found. They told me it was running, had 47,000 miles on it and was ready for me to pick up.' Perfect working order: The vehicle was in good condition having only been driven an extra 47,000 miles since being taken in 1981 . GM Product Development Executive Vice President Mark Reuss heard the story and offered to ship the car back to Detroit where it was delivered to Mr Talley at the automaker's world headquarters - about three miles from where it was stolen. 'George's story brought a smile to my face,' Mr Reuss said. 'As a longtime Corvette owner myself, I know the passion the car inspires.

"It's no surprise that Olympic heroes the Brownlee brothers have been announced in the England squad for this summer's Commonwealth Games. The Yorkshire-born and bred brothers will be going for gold in the triathlon - with their main competition one another. But while they are both keen to add Commonwealth champion to their list of achievements, they are also hoping their sportsmanship can encourage others to get active. Fun competition: The Brownlee brothers recommend families hold their own Commonwealth Games in their gardens this summer . Jonny, 24, told MailOnline: 'I remember getting up early to watch the . Sydney Olympics in 2000 and that really inspired me. I got up about 1am so I . could watch the triathlon live and it made me really want to get out . there and train. 'The Commonwealth Games is a massive opportunity for us . to inspire kids in the same way. There was a massive take up in sport . after the London Olympics and hopefully we'll see the same thing happen . this summer. It's so important that we capitalise on the current . climate of excitement ahead of the Games to inspire kids . to be more active.' Alistair, 26, who was originally hoping to compete in the 10k race in the Glasgow games as well as the triathlon (before injury intervened), agreed. But he added that it's not just children they want to encourage to get fit but their parents too. They teamed up with Warburtons to suggest fun activities families can do over the summer including creating their own Commonwealth Games in their gardens, by staging relay races and long jump competitions between siblings and their friends. Don't just sit on the sofa! The Olympians hope they can inspire children to be more active . Being competitive is important - the brother's sibling rivalry has certainly never done them any harm - but they point out it really is the taking part that counts. Alistair said: 'We like to do as much as we can to help people to get fit and this is one way to do that and encourage . people to be outside.' Alistair added it's important for parents to get involved, pointing out that along with his sporting heroes growing up like Paula Radcliffe, it was the adults in his life - his parents, teachers and coaches - who inspired him to become an Olympian. In turn, he inspired younger brother Jonny to strive to be the best. Research by Warburtons found that the 2012 Olympics had a positive effect on more than 50 per cent of children in the UK, inspiring them to work harder at school, join a sports club and spend more time outside. High profile sporting events this summer, including the World Cup, which kicked off last week, and July's Commonwealth Games, are set to continue the trend and inspire a third of children and over a quarter of parents to be more active this summer. The Brownlees said they would love it if they could inspire more people to take up triathlon, which has only been an official part of the Commonwealth Games since 2002. Olympic gold and bronze: Alistair, left, and Jonny hope to repeat their success at the Commonwealth Games . Alistair said they have definitely noticed an uptake in the sport, which involves swimming, cycling and running, since the London Olympics in which he took the gold and his brother the bronze. He said: 'Everyone knows what it . is now and many people will know someone who has done one. A lot more . people follow it more so there has been a massive change.' The brothers have responded to the demand by setting up their own triathlon races called Brownlee Tri. The first race was held in West Sussex yesterday and will be followed by an event in Leeds in September. The races are open to all abilities with 'super-sprint (400m open-water swim, 16km cycle, 2.5km run and 'sprint' (750m open-water swim, 29.5km cycle, 5km run) races on offer. The brothers said their own family inspired them to keep fit . The brothers are also in the process of setting up their own charity - the Brownlee Foundation - which will offer free triathlons to children in partnership with schools to encourage participation in the sport from a young age. But while the brothers are keen to inspire others to be triathletes, Jonny joked that he hoped it doesn't lead to a protege stealling their thunder in the near future. He said: I would be pleased in a way but hopefully it will be a few years before the people we inspired start beating us!'

"Face to face for the very first time with the man who had killed her son, Donna Holcomb was not gripped by anger in the Indianapolis court, but by overwhelming sadness. Because as she stared at Marvin Carter, 20, at his August 2012 bond hearing, it dawned on Methodist minister Holcomb that the young man who mowed down her son in a hit and run felt exactly the same way. But what neither of them knew at that moment was that they were to embark on a powerful journey of forgiveness that would eventually lead to Carter coming to call Holcomb 'mom' Salvation: Marvin Carter, 21, was imprisoned for . the July 12th, 2012 fatal motorcycle accident in Downtown Indianapolis . which killed Michael Holcomb and was offered forgiveness by his mother . Donna Holcomb . Carter was sentenced to two years in prison in November for the July 12th incident in Indianapolis, which left motorcyclist Michael Holcomb, 36, fatally wounded on the road. He still remembers the words of Halcomb's father, Michael Sr. as he told him, 'You were at the scene of the accident and you basically left my son there to rot and die.' As the judge ordered him to spend the next two years behind bars, Donna Holcomb broke down in tears on the witness stand. But as she held up a picture of her son and his dog Brody, she noticed that Carter too, had broken down. During the trial she learned that Carter had been in and out of foster care and had little contact with the criminal justice system. She heard how he cared for his dying mother when he came out of care at the age of 16 and how two weeks before his 18th birthday she died from a heart attack with Carter by her side. His sister told the court that her brother was the victim of a terrible childhood in care and suffered physical and sexual abuse. Holcomb told the Indystar.com that Carter's world, was one she has 'never been familiar with.' 'I’ve never been a young, black, underprivileged individual in the inner city,' she said. 'This situation opened my eyes and world to something I’ve never experienced. I began to really understand and realize the need and the opportunity to, maybe, just help one person. Maybe.' However, what occurred at his sentencing stunned Carter as Donna Holcomb walked over and said that she would like to stay in contact with him while he served his sentence. She said that it was her wish to help him get back on his feet. 'I was kind of shocked,' said Carter to the Indystar.com . 'I didn’t really understand why somebody would want to stay in contact with me. I thought it was kind of weird.' Imprisoned: Marvin Carter is visited by Donna Holcomb at Marion County Correctional Facility in Indianapolis where he serving his sentence for the hit and run of her son Michael . However, as Carter was being led out, Halcomb said, 'I'll talk to you like a mama, is that OK?' 'Yes ma'am,' replied Carter. Just three days later, the victim's advocate at the Marion County Prosecutor's Office received an email from Halcomb asking how to write letters to Carter. 'The true remorse that Marvin displayed that day was heartbreaking for everyone there,' she wrote. 'You can’t fake what he went through. .. This young man has lived through hell growing up and it’s only going to get worse in the DOC. 'And for sure, we want to send Marvin letters of encouragement and support. Someone has to start making a difference in his life so that he can see life is worth living.' It was on the evening of July 12th that Donna Holcomb's son Michael was riding his motorcycle through Meridan, Indiana when the 36-year-old IT project manager in Indianapolis careered into the car Carter was driving. Carter had been drinking, upset that his boyfriend had cheated on him and was driving without a license for his friend who did not feel well. The the immediate aftermath of the crash, Carter pulled over and exited the vehicle to witness Michael Holcomb try to reach for his cellphone as he lay on his back. Carter told the Indystar.com that for a brief moment their eyes met. 'If I stayed,' Carter said. 'I knew they would lock me up.' A cross dresser, Carter told the Indystar.com that he was fearful of the consequences for himself in prison. 'I was scared of me being gay,' he said. 'Of somebody raping me or probably just doing something to me.' So he ran and spent the next six days on the run - playing a game of phone-tag with the police who had tracked him down after they found his friend and the car they drove away from the scene. Grief stricken by their son's death, Donna Holcomb said that his arrest brought her only relief that he wouldn't do it again. Indeed, the next day when her son's killer's mugshot appeared on a news website, the emotional impact was small. In fact, the picture caption only read, 'a young black man in a mugshot.' Scene of the Tragedy: Intersection of 12th and Meridian in Indianapolis - where Marvin Carter smashed into Michael Holcomb and left him for dead . Holcomb could not have predicted that four months later she would be about to exchange life-changing letters with the young man who killed her son and ran away. Explaining why she began sending the letters, Holcomb said that she couldn't bear the thought of two lives going to waste. 'My son is dead and somebody else's son is going to be penalized. All of this for nothing,' she explained to Indystar.com . Writing her first letter in December, Holcomb told Carter about her family, about her son Michael. Two weeks later she received the first apologetic reply from Carter. 'If I could give my life and bring your son back, I would,' wrote Carter to Holcomb. Encouraging him to spend his time behind bars gaining a high school diploma, Holcomb even sent Carter a photograph of her family from Christmas. 'It might be really hard for you to understand that someone you don’t know can care, but we do and we want you to know that,' wrote Holcomb. As Carter slowly opened up, he told Holcomb about his abusive childhood and of his dreams to be a model. And then Carter asked her if she would mind terribly if he called her 'Mom'. 'It feels like you are more like my mom than anyone I’ve known since my mom died,' Holcomb recalled Carter saying in one of his letters to the Indystar.com . 'I feel like I can call you Mom.' In fact, Holcomb now signs off her letters as 'Mamma Donna', which is what her dead son used to call her. In February, Carter was visited by Holcomb and even pays a little money into his prison account so that he can buy snacks and toiletries. When he is released next May, Donna and Michael Holcomb Sr. hope to set up job training for Carter. 'I hope and pray that the bond we have formed helps him in some way to see himself as a valuable human being and that someone loves and cares for him versus the world taking advantage of him,' Donna Holcomb said.","Marvin Carter, 20, was drink driving on July 12th 2012, when he hit Michael Holcomb, 36, and fled the scene .

"When a 'charming' property goes on the market, it's often the same story- a pokey space dressed up as a cosy pad by estate agents who are looking for a quick sell. But in the case of this one-bed flat in London's exclusive Muswell Hill, which was the scene of serial killer Dennis Nilsen's murders, it'll take some serious convincing to make buyers look beyond the building's gruesome history. According to the Sun, the second floor flat, where Nilsen lived for 15 months in the early 80s has gone on the market for the bargain price of £265,000- nearly £100,000 less than comparable properties in the area. Scene of gruesome acts: Dennis Nilsen lured men back to his home in Muswell Hill and killed them. The one bed flat at the top of the house is now up for sale . On the cheap: The flat is a bargain-hunter's dream at just 265,000. Similar properties in the area sell for £350,000 . 'Rare opportunity': The property listing does not mention the  building's gruesome history, but potential buyers have been informed of its previous owner . Bairstow Eves estate agents say they are 'delighted to offer' the flat, which they describe as a 'rare opportunity' with 'lots of charm'. Perverse: Nilsen, now, 78, targeted rent boys and the homeless. He strangled them, had sex with the corpses and boiled the flesh off their bodies . The second floor period conversion in Cranley Gardens, Muswell Hill is said to have 'access to loft storage space'. The serial killer was only caught out after moving to the flat, where he lived in the attic and had no access to a garden. As a result he stuffed pieces of his victims' bodies down the drain. After complaints about the smell, a plumber found 30 to 40 pieces of . human flesh beneath the manhole cover, leading to Nilsen's arrest. Bairstow . Eves have revealed the details of the former owner to prospective . buyers but do not mention Nilsen in their online listing. According to the Sun, the property . was first put on the market for £280,000 in February and neighboring . flats are on sale for £350,000. The current owner has had the property for more than ten years, The Sun reports. The owner has shaved £15,000 off the asking price for the apartment which is still on the market six months on. Desirable area: Muswell Hill is one of London's most sought-after areas. But, according to the Sun, this property has been for sale for sic months . Room with a view: Nilson was caught after he moved to the Muswell Hill flat because he didn't have access to a garden. Instead, he put pieces of his victims' bodies down the drain . The top floor apartment has a double . bedroom with south-facing balcony, shower room, separate WC, living room . and fitted kitchen. Nilsen killed three of his fifteen male victims in the Cranley Gardens house between 1981 and 1983. He is known as the 'Muswell Hill murderer'. He killed most of his victims in Cricklewood, North West London between 1978 and 1981. Nilsen's victims were rent boys, . students and the homeless who he lured back to his home with the promise of food or shelter. Nilsen attempted to dispose of the bodies by boiling the heads, hands and feet to remove the flesh. He admitted to having sex with the corpses.","Scene of gruesome murders on sale for £100,000 less than its value .

"It is the exclusive Caribbean playground of the ultra-wealthy – a real-life fantasy island where nothing is too much trouble for its elite guests. Richard Branson’s idyllic Necker Island promises A-listers privacy and discretion, as well as the sort of unparalleled luxury that £40,000 a night buys. But now some of the secrets of the Virgin Islands paradise hideaway can be revealed, including the bizarre lengths staff go to in ensuring that their moneyed guests’ every whim is satisfied. One employee – an accountant – has told how she allowed guests to eat sushi off her naked midriff. Other visitors are encouraged to hit golf balls at a human target; while male serving staff have been asked to perform their duties ‘shirtless’. Scroll down for video . Staff have revealed the bizarre goings-on at Richard Branson’s idyllic Necker Island, where guests paid £40,000 a night . Visitors to Branson's Caribbean island take aim as they fire golf balls at human targets out to sea . Staff ear sumo suits and bounce on a trampoline as guests try to hit them with golf balls, a documentary reveals . Branson says staff are free to drink with guests and even have relationships with them, as part of the carefree atmosphere. ‘Necker is a place where people can draw up the drawbridge, let their hair down and relax,’ the Virgin mogul says. The approach seems to work, since the island’s guests have ranged from Princess Diana and Nelson Mandela to Kate Moss and One Direction’s Harry Styles. In a new BBC documentary, offering a rare glimpse at how the rich and powerful spend their holidays, one member of Necker Island’s accounts team, Milli, speaks of how she let guests eat sushi off her body for a birthday party. She originally suggested ‘eating sushi off a hot girl’ to some guests – not intending to be the human plate herself. But that is exactly what happened, causing some discomfort in the Caribbean sun... Milli, originally from Luton, said: ‘The sushi got really, really quite warm and stuck to me, so that was interesting. But it was fun. I love that I get to be an accountant and do this stuff and then go and lie on a table and have people suck soya sauce out of my belly button. It’s brilliant. Who else gets to do that?’ Amelia (left), an accountant on the island, allowed guests to eat sushi off her stomach. Right, another gorgeous worker . Necker Island promises A-listers privacy and discretion, as well as the sort of unparalleled luxury that £40,000 a night buys . According to Necker’s French chef, Clement Baris, it’s vital that the staff serving the food are as ‘sexy’ as the dish. A waiter explains to the BBC: ‘My role today is to look after the kayak in the pool – being sexy in the pool. About ten minutes before the guests come we will fill the kayak with palms and flowers and chopsticks and then we add the sushi to it. Then I’ll jump in the water, float about and people will jump in the pool and have fun, have drinks and eat the sushi. I might have a cocktail or two, sneaky ones, as well.’ Sir Richard, who bought Necker for just £180,000 in 1978, says: ‘We once had a new management team that came and they brought in two rules. The first was that staff cannot drink with the guests and staff may not have relationships with the guests. That management couple lasted one weekend. That is not the way this island would work or run very well.’ One member of Branson’s team tells the programme that the tycoon is a ‘matchmaker’ who makes it a mission to look after the girls who are ‘gorgeous and single’. Necker accommodates only 30 guests at a time but these VIPs have access to more than 100 staff. Regular visitors say the attractiveness and attentiveness of the staff are reasons they keep coming back. Branson says staff are free to drink with guests and even have relationships with them, as part of the carefree atmosphere . British-born property developer Penny, who was on her 21st visit to the island, said: ‘None of them are bad on the eyes. They are all pretty good-looking. We have favourites.’ Another British guest, called Patch, is shown enjoying a game of ‘sumo golf’, in which he and other guests shoot golf balls at a member of staff who bounces up and down on an offshore trampoline, while wearing protective clothing. Patch, from Birmingham, said the game uses balls made from soluble fish food rather than the real thing. But it was boiling hot inside the human target’s costume, and he later has to apply an ice pack to his neck. In other scenes, a couple ask for a massage on the trampoline in the sea, while a group who are sharing a hot tub ask if the waiter can serve their pina coladas ‘shirtless’. Sir Richard’s mansion on the island was hit by a lightning strike in 2011 and burnt down, but it has since been rebuilt at a cost of £9 million. Billionaire’s Paradise: Inside Necker Island will be broadcast on BBC2 on January 6 at 9pm.","Staff on Richard Branson's Caribbean island reveal bizarre goings-on .

"A former Chinese official arrested in a corruption probe has revealed the shocking catalogue of horrors he was subjected to as state torturers tried to force him to confess. Zhou Wangyan, who was land bureau director for the city of Liling, said he had his thigh bone snapped, was spoon-fed excrement and made to smoke ten cigarettes at the same time. 'My time in shuanggui (Communist party detention) was tragic and brutal. It was a living hell,' Zhou Wangyan, land bureau director for the city of Liling, said. Scroll down for video . Zhou Wangyan, head of the Liling city land resources bureau, shows X-ray images taken after surgery on his leg, which he says was broken by local Communist Party anti-graft investigators . Zhou Wangyan sits in a car in Zhuzhou city in central China's Hunan province across the road from Qiaotoubao, a Communist Party detention center where he says interrogators tortured him for months in 2012 and broke his leg . 'Those 184 days and five hours were not a life lived by a human. It was worse than being a pig or a dog.' Zhou said he was subjected to torture for 184 days before he confessed to graft as the Communist party regime heightens its fight against corruption under the leadership of premier Xi Jinping. Zhou was detained for six months at the notorious Qiaotoubao centre of anti-corruption where he had his thigh bone snapped by interrogators. He still walks on crutches 18 months later. Before his release in January 2013, Zhou gave what he said was a false confession to stop the torture. He signed a confession document that stated that he had received 40,000 yuan (£3,900) in bribes and wrote a resignation letter to that effect. During his torture he said he was pinned down and force-fed excrement with a spoon. The interrogators called it 'American Western Feast' and 'Eight Treasures Porridge'. Zhou demonstrates how he was tortured by Communist Party anti-graft investigators who struck at the soles of his feet with wires . Zhou is one of four party members in Hunan who provided rare, on-the-record accounts of abuse they suffered in the party's secretive 'shuanggui' detention system . Zhou uses crutches to stand near a computer displaying an image of him after his release from Communist Party detention . He was punched, dragged by his hair and forced to smoke 10 cigarettes at once. Interrogators broke four of Zhou's teeth by hitting him with a shoe and dunked his head into water until he believed he was drowning. Zhou's testament was corroborated by medical records, police statements and interviews with his family. Three others who detailed their experience provided other horrifying first-hand accounts of torture at the hands of Chinese interrogators. Wang Qiuping, an official in Ningyuan, was forced to stand and kneel for hours on end during his year in detention while Wang's deputy, Xiao Yifei, was beaten by a man known as 'Tang the Butcher' and hooded for an entire month. Fan Qiqing, a contractor in Ningyuan, alleged that he was lashed and forced to ingest hallucinogenic drugs. A local official said that an investigation into three corrupt officials had found no involvement in torture. Analysts have estimated that several thousand people are detained every year under a secret internal system that is not linked to the state justice structure. The alleged torture methods have been used on normal Chinese citizens, such as activists, as well as supposedly corrupt officials. China has been widely criticised for its human rights record and recently refuted a UN report linking its role in North Korea's human rights abuses.","Zhou Wangyan was held for 184 days before he confessed .

"They say that pets become more and more like their owners as time goes by. So it should come as no surprise then that, like his master, Larry the Downing Street cat is himself fond of a little ‘chillaxing’ now and then. And on a day when Britain basked in the hottest day of the year so far, with temperatures reaching a sizzling 27c (81f), who could blame him. Taking it easy: Larry the Downing Street had more of a reputation for chillaxing outside on the pavement than catching mice - until now . Stretched out in the Midday sun the brown and white tabby slumped down on his side and took a well-deserved cat nap just a few feet from the door of Number 10. Larry, a rescue cat from Battersea Dogs and Cats Home, was given the title of Chief Mouser to the Cabinet and was chosen by Downing Street staff to tackle a growing rat problem last year. But since his arrival he appears to lack the killer instinct and instead of boasting an impressive kill ratio Larry has become better known for his...sleeping. He may not have to worry about the eurozone crisis or hauling Britain out of recession, but that didn't stop Larry seemingly neglecting his rat catching duties when he soaked up the sun yesterday. Is David Cameron too 'chillaxed' to run the country? Is David Cameron too 'chillaxed' to run the country? Now share your opinion . David Cameron attracted some criticism for his own 'chillaxing' last week following claims in a biography that he spends weekends at Chequers singing karaoke, playing tennis against a machine dubbed ‘The Clegger’ and downing several glasses of wine with lunch. His latest afternoon snooze came as Britain baked. After the wettest April on record and perhaps the coldest start to May in 70 years the mercury is finally beginning to move in the right direction. Sunseekers poured onto the country’s beaches whilst others headed into the garden for a spot of sunbathing. Creature comforts: Larry, pictured last year, appears to enjoy a cat nap as much as any other feline . Those at the Chelsea Flower Show were left wilting whilst one man and his dinghy floated out to sea in South Devon sparking a major rescue operation. Incredibly Britain was hotter than parts of Australia, South America, Africa and the Middle East. It also left most of the Mediterranean in the shade. And the temperature is expected to rise even further today (thurs). Forecasters said it could reach up to 28c (xxf) in the south and south east - and best of all, the glorious sunshine and blue skies are here to stay for at least a fortnight. Met Office forecaster Helen Chivers said: ‘It is bikini and ice cream weather for almost the whole country. Distracted: The preoccupied Prime Minister attracted criticism for his supposed 'chillaxing' style when pictured watching the end of the Champions League final . Running talks: Earlier in this week's G8 summit talks at Camp David, Mr Cameron and President Obama staged a 35-minute 'treadmill summit' side by side at the gym . ‘Pretty much everywhere has temperatures in the 20s Celsius and wall-to-wall sunshine. ‘In recent weeks we had low pressure over or close to the UK, bringing rain and cold temperatures. ‘Over the last couple of days, that has given way to high pressure, sunny weather and rising temperatures from the Continent.’ At 26.9c (80.4f) yesterday (wed) was the hottest day of the year, but it is expected to get even hotter today (thurs). It will be 28c and sunny in London. Summer sun: Larry's sunbathing session came as the rest of the UK enjoyed a gloriously hot May, including here in Aviemore, Scotland, where temperatures reached 26.9C . Basking: Rhianna Mallia, 18, and Louise Dougherty, 21, were just two of the many people who enjoyed the sun in Aviemore, which posted the hottest temperatures of the year in the UK yesterday . Bizarrely, the highest temperature was not recorded in the south but in the Scottish ski resort of Aviemore. It also hit 26.9c (80.4f) at London’s Heathrow Airport, 25.9c (78.6f) on Bournemouth’s beaches and 25.6c (78.1f) in London’s St James’s Park. Supermarkets reported a surge in sales of sausages, burgers and summer tipple Pimms as well as picnic treats such as pork pies. Five million sausages - 70 per cent more than normal - are expected to fly off supermarket shelves over the weekend as the country makes the most of the mini heatwave. Not the only one: Larry the cat was one of many who decided to kick back yesterday, including angler Arthur Cansfield in the Lake District . Asda also predicts it will sell one million burgers, half a million bags of salad - 20 per cent more than in a normal week - as well as a 115 per cent increase in burger bun sales. Chris Carden, Asda’s head of fresh food supply, said: ‘We have already seen rising sales throughout the week of typical BBQ fare such as burgers and sausages but with the mini heatwave expected to continue into the weekend, we’re expecting it to be one of the biggest we’ve ever seen for barbecue foods.’ Only days ago the country endured temperatures up to 4c colder than the average for this time of year. Ironically, the sweltering weather comes amid a relaxation of the hosepipe ban which was imposed by seven water companies on April 5 after months of drought only for it to rain almost non-stop for the rest of the month. Meanwhile, the arrival of the sun saw betting firm Ladbrokes slash the odds of the temperature soaring past 39c (103f) during the Jubilee weekend from 20/1 to just 8/1. Jessica Bridge of Ladbrokes said: ‘It finally looks like summer has arrived, and the odds suggest the Jubilee weekend could be a scorcher.’","Downing St pet shows same knack for down time as his 'chillaxing' master .

"Yesterday, the European Space Agency made history when it landed its probe on the comet 67P. The event was fraught with excitement - and nerves -  after reports the probe hadn't managed to anchor itself to the site. For one scientist it all proved a little too much. Professor Monica Grady, who helped develop tools for the Philae probe, was filmed jumping for joy following the announcement, shouting: 'It's fantastic. It's wonderful. I've waited years for this and I'm so excited, I'm going to cry.' At one point, the 56-year-old space scientist was so overcome with emotion, she was filmed turning and hugging BBC Science editor David Shukman, for which she later apologised. Scroll down for video . Professor Monica Grady, who helped develop tools for Philae, was filmed jumping for joy following the landing announcement and shouted: 'It's fantastic. I've waited years for this. I'm going to cry.' At one point, she was so overcome with emotion, she was filmed hugging BBC Science editor David Shukman (pictured) The successful landing was the result of a decade of research and development, including a 4 billion mile (6.4 billion km) journey. Professor Grady, from the Open University, was part of a team which developed a tool used in the project called Ptolemy. The tool, which is the size of a shoebox, is fitted to Philae and will be used to analyse the composition of samples and gases from the 4.5 billion-year-old comet. Once she calmed down, she said to Mr Shukman: 'Now I'll try and be a professional scientist. 'This is an amazing moment in European space agency history. It's just so wonderful, we've waited so long and now it's happening.' Her colleague Professor Ian Wright added: ‘The idea that comets may have brought the building blocks of life to Earth is one of the reasons why we want to study them.’ Professor Grady, from the Open University, was part of a team which developed a tool used in the project called Ptolemy (pictured bottom left). Ptolemy, which is the size of a shoebox, is fitted to Philae and will be used to analyse the composition of samples and gases from the 4.5 billion-year-old comet . Scientists hope the £1billion project will solve some of the greatest puzzles in science – including the origins of life on Earth. Launched in March of 2004, the Rosetta spacecraft travelled over an arching orbit, that took it beyond the orbit of Jupiter on its way to the Comet 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko. However, controllers revealed that because harpoons supposed to tether it to the surface had not fired, the lander may have actually bounced, effectively landing twice - and leaving it attached only by screws on its legs. 'It's complicated to land on a comet, and complicated to understand what has happened during this landing,' said Dr Stefan Ulamec, Philae Lander Manager. The probe separated from the craft yesterday morning, and at the European Space Agency’s mission control in Germany, a faint radio signal came back from the lander at 4pm GMT. The Ukrainian astronomer Klim Tchurjumov (right), one of the discoverers of the comet 67P/Tchurjumov-Gerassimenko, and ESA General Director Jean-Jacques Dordain (left) hug each other at the satellite control center of the European Space Agency (ESA) in Darmstadt, Germany yesterday . The probe separated from the craft yesterday morning, and  a faint radio signal came back from the lander at 4pm GMT. There were fears that Philae was unstable, after thrusters and anchoring harpoons failed to fire. But, earlier this morning Esa announced it had made contact with the probe, and released this image . At mission control in Germany, the news of the landing was greeted with jubilation and high emotion by staff on the project. It is thought Philae is currently resting on the surface of the comet but its orientation is unknown Mark Bentley, the Principal Investigator on Rosetta's Midas instrument, told MailOnline . This was the proof the team needed that it had finally reached the surface of the comet. Dr Stephan Ulamec, who ran the audacious landing programme, said early tests suggested the craft had bounced softly before turning and settling again. He said: ‘It touched down and was re-bouncing. So maybe we didn’t just land, we landed twice.’ There were fears last night that Philae was unstable, after the landing thrusters and anchoring harpoons failed to fire. However, earlier this morning Esa announced it had made contact with the probe - but questions still remain about how secure it is. It is thought Philae is currently resting on the surface of the comet but its orientation is unknown and there is a 'chance it is on its side', Mark Bentley, the Principal Investigator on Rosetta's Midas instrument, told MailOnline. ‘From what we’ve heard overnight it seems there is a suspicion yesterday that there was some bouncing involved. ‘Two instruments have confirmed Philae appears to have touched down followed by two subsequent touchdowns effectively. Rosetta has chased comet 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko through space for more than ten years in what has been described as 'the sexiest, most fantastic mission ever' The lander announced its arrival with this historic tweet following its ten-year mission. Launched in March of 2004, the Rosetta spacecraft travelled over an arching orbit, that took it beyond the orbit of Jupiter on its way . The lander was dropped from a height of 13.6 miles (21.8 km). This image shows comet 67P/CG from a distance of approximately 1.8 miles (3km) from the surface . ‘So the fact we’re now getting data back from the orbiter looks good, it suggests the lander is stable on the surface. The probe bounced twice on the surface after the landing yesterday, once to a height of 0.62 miles (1km), before coming to rest on the comet. Dr Stefan Ulamec, Philae Lander Manager said: ‘Did we just land in a soft-sand box and everything is fine? Or is there something else happening? We still do not fully understand what has happened.’ British scientist Dr Matt Taylor, who played a key role in the mission, said: ‘To see this mountaineering effort, that we’ve descended a lander to the surface of a comet, I can’t put words to it. It’s beautiful.’ And the expert was so confident of success that he had even had an image of the space probe tattooed on his right leg. There were fears last night that Philae was unstable, after landing thrusters and anchoring harpoons failed to fire. However, earlier this morning Esa announced it had made contact with the probe - but questions still remain about how secure it is . When Philae touched the surface of the comet it fired harpoons into the surface to keep it anchored there. To keep it attached to the surface a thruster at the top was meant to push it down as the harpoons fired. But before the launch, the thruster didn't appear to be working - and it was confirmed the harpoons didn't fire. This meant the lander may have had to rely solely on screws on its legs. The surface was much softer than they expected, so there were some concerns that Philae was not securely fixed on the comet - although from a software point of view things seemed to be fine. However, earlier this morning Esa announced it had made contact with the probe - but questions still remain about how secure it is. It is thought Philae is currently resting on the surface of the comet but its orientation is unknown and there is a 'chance it is on its side', Mark Bentley, the Principal Investigator on Rosetta's Midas instrument, told MailOnline. ‘From what we’ve heard overnight it seems there is a suspicion yesterday that there was some bouncing involved. ‘Two instruments have confirmed Philae appears to have touched down followed by two subsequent touchdowns effectively. Before the attempt yesterday, there was also a good luck message from a man who had once boasted of boldly going into space himself. Star Trek actor William Shatner sent the team a video in which the 83-year-old said: ‘Good luck Rosetta, Philae’s gonna land.’ One scientist then described the seven hours of ‘terror’ they went through to drop the Philae lander 13.6 miles above the comet from its mothership, Rosetta. Much of the equipment aboard the lander was switched on for the first time after lying dormant during the ten-year journey. Klim Churyumov, one of the Ukrainians who discovered the comet 45 years ago and named it, said from mission control in Darmstadt, Germany: ‘We saw the first light from this comet in 1969, now we are landing on it. It is a fantastic, outstanding event, the first like it in human civilization.’ The probe is equipped with cameras, a suite of ten instruments, and a drill that can bore out samples to a depth of nine inches.","Professor Monica Grady was filmed following the announcement the Philae probe successfully landed on the comet 67P yesterday .

"After winning the Tour de France and an Olympic gold medal last year, it is no surprise that Sir Bradley Wiggins wants to give his legs a much needed rest. Instead of getting on his racing bike, the 33-year-old Mod who is known for his mutton-chopped sideburns and Fred Perry t-shirts, was spotted in Southport cruising around on a white and gold scooter. The BBC Sports Personality of the Year winner, who was awarded a knighthood in the 2013 New Year Honours, recently shaved off his trademark sideburns but kept up his Mod credentials speeding around on the moped while sporting a pair of Wayfarer sunglasses.

"Eccentric and outgoing fitness personality Richard Simmons, who was once famed for his attention-grabbing behavior, has not been seen in public for a year. The 66-year-old fitness instructor who rose to prominence for his quirky weight-loss videos and TV appearances is now reported to be suffering from health issues. According to his official website, Richard has helped 'millions of overweight men and women lose more than three million pounds' with his 65 fitness videos and nine books. Scroll down for video .

The eighties fitness guru (pictured left and right) claims to have helped Americans shed three million pounds . But there are concerns Simmons is hiding out at his home in a state of depression over some much-needed knee replacement surgery. If the surgery is ignored, he may never be able to exercise again, TMZ reported. A source said Simmons was terrified of the surgery and has avoided undergoing it for most of the year. MailOnline has requested comment from Mr Simmons' agent. Since his 80s heyday Richard Simmons has constantly sought to regain his faded fame, and can be easily recognized in LA by his bushy hair and trademark exercise shorts and tank top. In 2011, the fitness guru had Dancing With The Stars viewers talking about his seemingly slimmed down build whist appearing on the show to coach celebrity contestant Chaz Bono. The 63-year-old's smaller frame sparked speculation that something was awry, and perhaps he might even be ill - though this speculation was later quashed by his agent. Simmons continues to run the Beverley Hills exercise studio, called Slimmons Studio, that he established in 1974.","Eccentric fitness guru Richard Simmons not seen in public for months .

"Despite the obvious delight in finding his long-lost cat Freya, George Osborne must have had some concerns about letting her loose on Downing Street. Ever since David Cameron replaced Gordon Brown as Prime Minister, there has only been one feline ruling the roost on the famous street. Larry the cat - the Prime Minister's pet - was often spotted by famous dignitaries, reporters and photographers hunting for prey. New predator: Mr Cameron has brought in Chancellor George Osborne's tabby Freya (above) as chief mouser at Number 10 in Larry's place . Turf war: When Freya was returned to George Osborne, there would no doubt have been some concerns as to how she would get on with Larry, the Prime Minister's cat . But a few weeks ago, after George Osborne's long lost cat Freya was found safe and well - Larry's world turned upside down. No longer was he the only Downing Street cat, which must have led to concerns about a turf war between the two pets. But if these latest pictures are anything to go by, it seems the Chancellor has little to worry about. New friend: The Prime Minister's cat Larry, pictured, has had the run of Downing Street since David Cameron took office . Freya was pictured yesterday prowling the famous street and getting used to her new surroundings, clearly unafraid of upsetting Larry. Chancellor George Osborne and his family had assumed Freya had vanished for ever up until recently. Tabby Freya was just a few months old when she went missing from the Osbornes’ Notting Hill home three years ago. Mr Osborne, wife Frances and their two young children Luke and Liberty searched the streets of West London and put up ‘lost’ posters, but to no avail. Nice surprise: The Chancellor and his family had given up hope of finding Freya after she went missing three years ago . They gave up hope long before moving into Downing Street last year, assuming the cat had got lost – or worse, been run over. So they transferred their affections to the family budgie, Gibson, named after RAF Dambusters hero Guy Gibson, and two goldfish. But two weeks ago, Frances, an author, received a phone call telling her Freya was alive and well. She had been living as a stray in a garden a few streets away from the Osbornes’ Notting Hill house, lovingly fed and looked after by a neighbour who had not seen the posters. Freya, looking particularly well-nourished, was reunited with the Osbornes after a visit to a vet revealed a microchip beneath its skin bearing Mrs Osborne’s phone number. A few days later, Freya, looking fit and healthy, was installed in Downing Street. The Osbornes live in the flat above No 10, which they moved into more than a year after the 2010 Election, while the Camerons live above No 11. Before Freya was let loose in the garden, she was introduced to Larry, the Camerons’ cat. A Treasury spokesman said recently: ‘She is settling in nicely and getting on well with family, staff and Larry.’ Neighbour: The Camerons' cat Larry (pictured) is getting on well with Freya .

"Bookmakers William Hill weighed in punter Alistair Lee with a special present of £5,000 yesterday after he staked £50 at 100-1 that he could lose 100lbs by Christmas. Alistair, 28, had placed a £25 bet a year earlier at 46-1 that he’d spend Christmas thinner, but that failed so he returned with an increased stake of £50 12 months later as an incentive to lose a third of his body weight. And remarkably after falling ill at the start of this year, Alistair lost all the weight with an exercise and healthy eating regime in just three months and saw his waistline plunge from 52 inches to 38 inches. Before and after: Alistair Lee (left before) bet he would lose 100lbs by Christmas and managed to (right after) No longer a Christmas pudding, Alistair, who went from 23st 2lbs to 15st - a full stone below his 100lbs target weight to win the bet, said: ‘It was all about exercise and healthy eating. ‘I’d seen a story a couple of years ago in the papers about a man called Peter Heeks who placed a bet to lose 100lbs and won £10,000 and that’s when I tried to do the same. ‘That year I had £25 on and failed in my attempt, but I was getting depressed by my weight so last Christmas tried again with a fresh bet. ‘The odds this time were 100-1 and I placed £50 on to win £5,000 - the winnings were an added incentive to reach the target. ‘I fell ill with pneumonia at the start of the year and was unable to do anything for about six weeks. I ended up in hospital for three to four weeks with a lump in my chest that needed a drain fitting. ‘It was only at the end of August that I was fit enough to start exercising properly and I started with a Slimming World diet for the first eight weeks. ‘But my trainers Jun Yung and Kelsey Yung at the FDMA gym in Barrow-in-Furness altered my diet to make sure that I was eating the right level of calories to do the exercise. Slimming World helped me with the support group side of things. ‘I’ve been to loads of gyms in the past, but Jun was fantastic and everyone at the gym was very supportive and gave me all the information I needed to reach my target. ‘I am single and one of the main motivators for me, apart from the bet, was I wanted to meet someone and I wanted to look my best to do it. William Hill paid out the £5,000 winnings to Alistair who bet who could lose 100lbs by Christmas Day . ‘About five years ago I lost all the weight, but I put it all back on with lack of exercise and my diet before was genuinely horrendous. ‘I developed sleep apnea and got depression, but everything is back to normal now. My parents are amazed as they hadn’t seen me for about eight weeks and in that time I dropped about 70lbs. ‘I have had friends drive past me in the street who didn’t recognise me. When William Hill accepted that second bet they helped change my life.’ Alistair, from Crewe, Cheshire, who works for a Manchester-based safety engineering company, was spending one to three hours a day in the gym doing circuit training and walking for 40 minutes daily with a 60lbs pack on his back. He added: ‘On Sundays I go out for a couple of hours and do an eight to 10 mile walk. I feel pretty good now, apart from occasionally being knackeredfrom training.’ Bookmakers William Hill take about one hundred bets a year on weight loss,but Alistair is in the top three all-time payouts from dieting flutters and the only punter ever to win his bet on Christmas Day. William Hill’s spokesman Rupert Adams said: “When he called to say he had succeeded we were flab-ergasted, this is an amazing achievement and he deserves his winnings. ‘We obviously, reckoned he was a 100-1 shot having failed in his attempt the year before.'","Alistair Lee bet he would lose 100lbs by Christmas .

"A number of McDonald's restaurants have been slammed for advertising their fast food directly to young children and offering them free food products. The Advertising Standards Board (ASB) heard that the fast food chain issued vouchers to children aged 10 years and under who were participating in the University of Sunshine Coast Basketball Club Competition in late September. Forming part of the Team Spirit Award handed to the children, the voucher was redeemable for a 'small cheeseburger meal' or 'seared snack wrap, apple bag and small orange juice' at eight McDonald's restaurants in the Sunshine Coast, Queensland. McDonald's restaurants in Victoria and the Sunshine Coast have been caught advertising fast food to children under the age of 14 . The ASB upheld the complaint, finding that McDonald's had breached the Quick Service Restaurant Initiative for Responsible Advertising to Children (QSRI) as the products advertised did not meet the nutritional criteria. The complainant claimed that the fast food chain had 'little concern for the dietary health of Australian children' due to repeatedly breaching the QSRI. The comment referred to an earlier instance in July when McDonald's stores were found to have breached the code after handing out vouchers at a playground in Victoria. Picturing Ronald McDonald standing with a group of people on one side with the words 'play money', the other side of the voucher had an image of McDonald's chips next to the words 'free small fries with any purchase'. The most recent complaint regarded a voucher redeemable for a small cheeseburger meal' or 'seared snack wrap, apple bag and small orange juice' that was handed out as an award for children participating in the University of Sunshine Coast Basketball Club Competition in late September . The vouchers were redeemable at five different McDonald's restaurants in Victoria. McDonald's responded to the complaint by saying that the vouchers were withdrawn and made no longer available once it became aware of the breach. 'We believe this Complaint to be an isolated incident concerning the Nominated Restaurants only,' the chain restaurant wrote to the ASB. 'McDonald's is a business with over 920 restaurants and whilst we have strict controls in place to ensure compliance with the QSRI the Voucher was unfortunately not passed through our standard internal review and approval process.' The ASB upheld the complaints, finding that McDonald's had breached the Quick Service Restaurant Initiative for Responsible Advertising to Children (QSRI) Following the second incident, McDonald's responded again by saying the Awards had been withdrawn and made no longer available. 'In light of this complaint… McDonald's has updated its guidelines in consultation with the ASB in relation to its compliance requirements when providing food or beverage vouchers to children under 14 years of age,' it wrote in response to the complaint. 'All members of the McDonald's system will be reminded of their responsibilities under the QSRI to ensure that only food and beverages that represent healthier choices are promoted to children. 'We have also reaffirmed our standard advertising review protocol which requires advertising to be approved through appropriate channels. Training has and will continue to be undertaken with relevant McDonald's team members to improve understanding in these areas.'","McDonald's restaurants in Victoria and the Sunshine Coast have been slammed for advertising free food to children under 14 .

"Alesha Dixon has quit the judging panel of Strictly Come Dancing. The pop star, who controversially replaced choreographer Arlene Phillips in 2009, is leaving after three series on the BBC show.

"Ask a man in his 50s about his ideal woman, and chances are she would be half his age. And if a 20-year-old described his dream date, he’d probably choose someone a little bit older. For, according to a study, no matter how old a man is he always hankers after a woman in her mid-20s. Scroll down for video . A study has found that men, no matter what age they are, want to be with a woman in her mid-20s. Celebrity couple Jason Statham, 47, Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, 27, show that this can work . But, while the odd celebrity may enjoy some success – such as 47-year-old actor Jason Statham, who is dating model Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, 27 – most men’s daydreams do not match their reality, as their wife or girlfriend is more likely to be close to them in age. But women seem to be a little more realistic, as they tend to fancy men their own age or slightly older. They are more likely to get their way, too, with most of those surveyed in relationships with men a year or two older. Finnish researchers asked more than 12,500 men and women about the age of their partner and the age of the people they felt most attracted to or fantasised about. The magic number for men of all ages was around 24 or 25, since older men preferred younger women and those in their late teens or early 20s fancied slightly older women. The researchers believe evolution has programmed men to desire women in their mid-20s because they are highly fertile, meaning they have the highest odds of bearing the man’s child and passing on his genes. But women are programmed very differently. The study, in the journal Evolution and Human Behavior, found women think men their own age or slightly older are the most attractive. The biggest age gap was for women in their late teens and early 20s, who fancied men around four years older. Researcher Jan Antfolk, of Abo Akademi University in Turku, south Finland, said a slightly older male is more likely to have the money and stability to bring up a family than a younger man. And although a much older ‘sugar daddy’ may have more money, he is more likely to die while his family are still young.","A study has found that men always want to be with women in their mid-20s .

"Tottenham have developed a reputation this season for finding the target late on in games, but it is in fact local rivals Arsenal that have scored the most injury-time goals in the Premier League. Football statistics company WhoScored.com identified that the Gunners have scored an incredible seven times in the closing stages of matches in 2014-15, four more than any other side in the top flight. On the opening day of the season Aaron Ramsey scored a 91st minute-winner against Crystal Palace at the Emirates, remarkably it is the only one of the seven injury-time goals that have converted a draw into three points.

"It is 6.30am on the A1 just outside of Durham. Four lifelong followers of Sunderland Association Football Club are in a Peugeot 508, the Sat Nav loaded for the railway town of Eastleigh in Hampshire. The mood is one of optimism. For the past fortnight the Black Cats have been purring in the wake of their 3-1 win victory over Stoke. Paul Dobson – the 58-year-old assistant editor of the fanzine A Love Supreme – and his three pals spend the next six hours debating team selection – Jordi Gomez versus Jack Rodwell – and tactics – two up front versus lone frontman Steven Fletcher. As the quartet will later learn, it matters not. Sunderland's player collapse on the floor during their humiliating 8-0 defeat on the south coast . They arrive at their Travelodge in Eastleigh, settle the £60 room rate, square up £20 a man for petrol and dish out the match tickets - a relatively reasonable £24 each – leaving £50 in their back pocket for a few beers – they’ ll certainly need them as the day transpires. They then jump on a train to Southampton where they join 2,500 fellow supporters for Saturday afternoon’s game at St Mary’s Stadium. And so the nightmare begins. By 3.20pm their side are trailing by two, the first an absolute belter of a volley from Santiago Vergini. The Argentine, however, is a Sunderland defender rather than a Southampton striker. Just over an hour later it is 5-0. ‘At 5-0 we were angry,’ reflects Dobson. Come full-time, however, fury had made way for gallows humour, the scoreboard reading a humiliating 8-0. The electronic scoreboard at St Mary's displays the full extent of the defeat for the travelling supporters . ‘It was just comedic come the end,’ Dobson continues. ‘We were just laughing at how bad it was – it had gone way past being angry. ‘In a perverse way we actually started supporting the team and the away end was bouncing – some things never cease to amaze me. ‘A few of the players came over to applaud – the goalkeeper Vito Mannone was nearly crying – but a couple of them were down the tunnel faster than they’d moved all day. ‘It was a shocking performance, as bad as I’ve seen.’ So had 90 minutes ruined an entire weekend? ‘Yes,’ Dobson returns without hesitation. ‘The match completely spoilt the day. The home fans revel in the delight of their team's destruction of a hapless Sunderland side . ‘It was embarrassing. The own goals were comical. The first one, a striker would have been proud of it, and that set the tone for the day really.’ The crestfallen Mannone later insisted the players should refund fans who made the trek to the South Coast. ‘I would rather they’d just put on a performance and got three points,’ Dobson – a retired engineer, father of two and grandfather of two - says of Mannone’s suggestion. ‘But it would be a nice gesture I suppose – money back or tickets for a game in the future.’ Travelling supporters sit stony-faced after watching Gus Poyet's side concede their sixth goal of the afternoon . Tickets for a game in the future? ‘Yeah, of course, I’ll still be going home and away,’ he counters. ‘It was like being punched in the face and yeah, it was horrible, but we’ll be back. That’s what you do. ‘We held the post-mortem over a few beers on Saturday night. Thankfully, we missed the start of Match of the Day because we were first on. ‘We drove back up yesterday and didn’t even mention the game. I think we all just wanted to get home as soon as possible.’ Home – that is probably where they wish they had stayed all along.

"An Iranian strategic expert has warned that one of President Obama's daughters will be kidnapped and raped if America attacks Syria. Alireza Forghani, also the former governor of southern Iran’s Kish Province, warned of mass abductions and killings of American citizens worldwide in the event the Obama administration launches a military strike in Syria. 'Hopefully Obama will be pigheaded enough to attack Syria, and then we will see the … loss of U.S. interests [through terrorist attacks],' he threatened. 'In just 21 hours [after the attack on Syria], a family member of every U.S. minister [department secretary], U.S. ambassadors, U.S. military commanders around the world will be abducted. And then 18 hours later, videos of their amputation will be spread [around the world]' he said reported The Daily Caller. The threat comes amid reports today that the U.S has intercepted an order from an Iranian official instructing militants in Iraq to attack U.S. interests in Baghdad if the attack goes ahead. Claims: The U.S has intercepted an order from an Iranian official instructing militants in Iraq to attack U.S. interests in Baghdad in the event the Obama administration launches a military strike in Syria, it was reported today .

In addition, the State Department issued a warning on Thursday telling U.S. citizens to avoid all but 'essential' travel to Iraq . The newspaper said the message went to Iranian-supported Shi'ite militia groups in Iraq. The Journal reported that the message informed Shi'ite groups to be prepared to respond with force after any U.S. military strike on Syria. 'Travel within Iraq remains dangerous given the security situation,' according to the State Department's warning, which replaced an earlier one 'to update information on security incidents and to remind U.S. citizens of ongoing security concerns in Iraq, including kidnapping and terrorist violence.'

Sunshine smiles : President Putin, left, President Obama and German Chancellor Angela Merkel and PM David Cameron as they pose for the family photo . The department said that numerous insurgent groups, including al Qaeda's Iraq affiliate, remain active and 'terrorist activity and sectarian violence persist in many areas of the country at levels unseen since 2008.' It added: 'The ability of the embassy to respond to situations in which U.S. citizens face difficulty, including arrests, is extremely limited.' The State Department declined immediate comment. The CIA declined comment. The US and France are so far the only nations attending the G20 to have backed the use of military force against the Assad regime, with Russia and China insisting that any action in the absence of UN Security Council approval would be illegal.

President Barack Obama, left, listens as Russian President Vladimir Putin, right, speaks during the start of the G-20 Working Session . US frustrations over Russia's stance were reflected in comments by the American envoy to the UN, Samantha Power, who told a New York news conference: 'Even in the wake of the flagrant shattering of the international norm against chemical weapons use, Russia continues to hold the (Security) Council hostage and shirk its international responsibilities. 'What we have learned, what the Syrian people have learned, is that the Security Council the world needs to deal with this crisis is not the Security Council we have.' The US Government accuses Assad's forces of killing 1,429 people in a poison-gas attack in a suburb of the Syrian capital, Damascus, on August 21. Britain announced yesterday that scientists at the Porton Down research laboratories have found traces of the nerve gas sarin on cloth and soil samples retrieved from the site of the attack. Meanwhile, there were signs that Mr Obama may struggle to secure support in Congress for his proposal of 'limited and proportionate' military action against Assad. A poll commissioned by the BBC and ABC News suggested more than one-third of Congress members were undecided whether or not to back military action, while a majority of those who had made a decision said they would vote against the President. The survey found that 226 members of the House of Representatives said they would oppose or were likely to oppose military action, against 45 who were certain or likely to support it and 189 who were undecided or did not respond. Some 17 members of the Senate were certain or likely to oppose Mr Obama's plans, against 23 certain or likely to back him and 60 whose position was undecided or unknown.","Threats made by Alireza Forghani, former governor of Iran’s Kish Province .

"Cesc Fabregas was involved in a light training session on Thursday, though it remains unclear whether the Chelsea midfielder will be fit for the title showdown against Manchester City this weekend. The Spaniard, 27, limped off during the Capital One Cup clash with Liverpool with a hamstring problem minutes after colliding with captain John Terry at Stamford Bridge. While Fabregas wasn’t able to take part in a full session with his team-mates at Cobham, he was assessed and is yet to be ruled out of Saturday’s game at home to the Premier League champions.

"The Chinese Swimming Association (CSA) has defended the three-month ban handed out to world and Olympic swimming champion Sun Yang for a doping offence. The CSA released a statement on Tuesday saying it believed Sun had made a mistake but never intended to cheat. 'Sun took the drug without an intention to improve his result, but both he and the Zhejiang swimming association had made mistakes,' said the statement. The Chinese Swimming Association has defended the three-month ban handed to world champion Sun Yang . Sun, who competes for the Zhejiang swimming association, secretly served the suspension earlier this year after testing positive for the banned stimulant trimetazidine during the Chinese national championships in May. The China Anti-Doping Agency (CHINADA) could have imposed a longer ban but said it decided on three months because Sun had been given medication by a doctor to treat a heart issue and was unaware it had been added to the World Anti-Doping Agency's (WADA) banned list this year. 'We believe Sun did not intend to cheat,' said Xu Qi, team leader of the Chinese national swimming team. Yang won four medals at the London 2012 Olympics including two golds (400m freestyle, 1500m freestyle) 'The punishment was in accordance with related rules and reasonable.' Swimming's world governing body FINA issued a brief notice confirming the three-month ban and also a 12-month suspension that was handed out to Sun's doctor, Ba Zhen. Sun served his suspension in time to represent China at the Incheon Asian Games in South Korea in late September, where he won three gold medals. But news of the ban was only announced on Monday, prompting questions as to why it was not released earlier. In China, where Sun is regarded as a national hero after winning two gold medals at the 2012 London Olympics, the media were looking for answers. World champion yang served his ban between May and August this year, but nobody knew about it . The People's Daily, the official newspaper of the ruling Chinese Communist Party, raised several questions in a commentary. The paper asked why Sun did not declare his medication to the doping control officer and why star athletes 'still do not understand the rules.' 'Perhaps society cannot demand that public figures maintain excellence in everything, but to ask that public figures pass every test in every undertaking, that standard is not too much,' the paper wrote. 'Clearly Sun Yang has shortcomings and those closest to him have not helped him improve.' On Weibo, China's version of Twitter, the hashtag 'Sun Yang's punishment for doping' was viewed more than 67 million times.","Sun Yang served three month ban after testing positive for trimetazidine .

"These unusual structures - with their intricate designs and symmetrical forms - may look like they have been created by a 3D printer, but they are in fact more than a century old. Displayed at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), they are the artistic equivalent of a mathematical equation. According to the team that collected the designs, the structures reveal how mathematics can describe the world around us, even in its most complex forms. The unusual structures - with their intricate designs and symmetrical forms - may look like they have been created by a 3D printer, but they are in fact more than a century old . The Clebsch Diagonal Surface is one of the most famous surfaces in mathematics.  It was described by Alfred Clebsch in 1871. It is remarkable as it has exactly 27 straight lines that lie flush to its surface. The surface has three branches that join in a central column and in a flaring base. The 27 lines, etched in black, extend toward infinity. There are exactly 10 points on the structure’s surface where three of the 27 lines meet. These points are called Eckardt points, and the Clebsch diagonal surface is the only cubic surface to contain them. Joshua Batson in Wired reports that the structures were created by Göttingen-based mathematician Felix Klein and displayed in Chicago in 1893. MIT, the University of Arizona, Harvard, and the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign ordered a large collection of his models which are now on display. ‘Digitally controlled 3D printers now produce such mathematical objects in exactly the same way as people did a century ago,’ Professor George Francis from the University of Illinois told MailOnline. ‘Both compute the data points from formulas, and build up the models, layer by layer like a wedding cake - but with thinner layers.’ MIT describes the structures as the artistic equivalent of a mathematical equation, designed to let algebra move away from the chalkboard and into physical form .

To build the model, workers in Klein’s laboratory drew the horizontal sections solving a planar version of the equation. Each cross-section was cast separately, in a plaster made from powdered chalk.

"Google funnelled an astonishing £6billion through the tax haven of Bermuda in a year – while paying just 0.1 per cent of that amount in British corporation tax. Official documents reveal that by exploiting the tiny tax haven the internet giant halved its global tax bill in 2011 – leaving governments, including the UK, out of pocket by more than £1billion. In the same year the firm legally arranged its accounts to surrender just £6million in corporation tax in the UK.

In a letter to Barack Obama, Angela Merkel, Vladimir Putin and other G8 chiefs, the Prime Minister said co-ordinated action is needed to make major corporations and wealthy individuals pay their fair share of tax. Mr Cameron said: ‘I do believe  we all have a common interest in being able to tell our taxpayers who work hard and pay their fair share of taxes that we will make sure others do the same.’ His intervention follows a year in . which the tax affairs of multinationals and wealthy individuals have . come under intense scrutiny and criticism in the UK. Bold steps: David Cameron urged fellow G8 leaders to crack down on tax dodging by international companies . Major firms such as Google, Amazon and Starbucks were described as . ‘immoral’ by MPs on the Public Accounts Committee following revelations . about the legal loopholes they exploit to reduce their corporation tax . liabilities in this country to almost nothing. Last month Starbucks was shamed into offering to pay £20million to the Treasury over two years following a public backlash and consumer boycott. But campaigners say a systematic drive is now needed to close down tax loopholes across the world. Official documents revealed that the amount Google is diverting offshore has almost doubled over the past three years. They also show the extraordinary lengths taken by the firm to avoid tax. Google’s UK boss Matt Brittin admitted . to MPs last year that the company uses Bermuda, a renowned tax shelter . where firms are not forced to pay a penny on their profits, to hide some . of its money. Google . lowered its UK tax bill for 2011 by more than £200million by pushing . £2.6billion of British revenues offshore. Company chairman Eric Schmidt . said he is ‘very proud’ of the elaborate structure which enabled it to . pay so little. Now official documents have emerged showing the full extent of the labyrinthine payments. Google lists its employees and operations based in the UK as a ‘service arm’ – which reports considerably smaller revenues. The firm uses an Irish subsidiary to collect advertising revenues from Britain and other nations. The . Irish group then pays royalties to another Irish company, and these . payments are then transferred to a holding company in the Netherlands, . which has its tax base in Bermuda. Last year the payments to this Dutch . group, which has no registered employees, were £6.1billion, according to . official documents filed by the company. This is an increase of 81 per cent on the £3.4billion sheltered in the company in 2008. By . using this complex structure to push revenues offshore, Google cuts its . global tax bill in half – as the amount sheltered is equal to around 80 . per cent of its pre-tax profits from last year. Dodgers' heaven: Google's haven of choice, Bermuda, is a renowned for their tax laws which do not force companies to pay tax on their profits . The same official documents show that Google’s tax rate outside of the US was just 3.2 per cent last year, even though the vast majority of its operations are in European countries where tax rates vary between 26 and 34 per cent. The findings are ‘a deep embarrassment to governments across Europe’, said tax accountant Richard Murphy. ‘The only people who benefit from this policy are Google’s management. ‘As well as short-changing taxpayers, the company’s shareholders are short-changed because the money is locked away in Bermuda. ‘Management is denying shareholders any prospects of the dividends they deserve for investing in the company.’ The Chancellor has announced he will this year bring in a general anti-abuse rule to clamp down on tax avoidance – which is legal but viewed as morally questionable. The UK yesterday took over the 12-month revolving presidency of the G8 group of leading industrialised countries. In his letter to fellow leaders Mr Cameron urged them to start work now on preparing ‘bold steps’ to take when they meet in Northern Ireland in June for the G8’s annual summit. He warned he would not allow a summit where rich nations ‘simply whip out a chequebook at the 11th hour, pledge some money and call it a success’.","Google funneled £6billion to Bermuda, avoiding £1billion tax bill .

"A mysterious plane has reportedly been raided for drugs by police at an Illawarra regional airport after flying from the US via the Marshall Islands, Guam and the Philippines. The search of the Swearingen Merlin 3 twin-turbo prop plane at Albion Park, south of Wollongong, started on Tuesday even though it arrived at the airport almost two weeks ago. The Middle Eastern Organised Crime Squad carried out the raid with help from local police. Police continue to go over a US-registered Swearingen Merlin 3 twin-turbo prop plane at the Illawarra Airport, Albion Park on Thursday . A spokesman for the State Crime Command said the operation was part of an active investigation and refused to provide further comment. Acting Inspector Matthew Glasgow from Albion Park police told Daily Mail Australia local police assisted with the initial search of the plane but had 'nothing more to do with it'. It is reported that 35kg of drugs were seized from the aircraft and a man was taken into custody in relation to the incident, but police would not confirm this. Flight records show the 43-year-old plane is owned by a US-registered company called the Oregonian Aero Club and since April it has flown through Florida in the US via Alaska, Missouri, Texas, California, Washington and Hawaii, the Illawarra Mercury reported. The mysterious plane has reportedly been raided for drugs by police at the airport after flying from the US via the Marshall Islands, Guam and the Philippines . The plane left Hawaii on May 2 to fly to Marshall Islands, roughly halfway to Queensland. It then flew northeast to the US territory of Guam, which is 2000km east of the Philippines. On May 5 it arrived in Angeles City, near Manila in the Philippines – the last place it is known to have been before arriving in Australia. It did not show up on control tower records until June 27 when it left Coffs Harbour airport to travel to Albion Park. The Oregonian Aero Club was incorporated in Wilmington, Delaware – where tax on planes can be limited because aircrafts are able to be registered to a trustee corporation rather than a person. It is reported that 35 kg of drugs were seized from the aircraft and a man was taken into custody in relation to the incident .","A plane has reportedly been raided for drugs by police at Albion Park .

"'To boldly (not) go': William Shatner as USS . Enterprise captain James Tiberius Kirk, who explored space in the . original series of Star Trek . As Captain James T Kirk he was ready to boldly go where no man has gone before. But it's been claimed that William Shatner turned down the chance to travel into space aboard Virgin Galactic's Spaceship Two because he's scared of flying. Virgin tycoon Sir Richard Branson said he offered the original Star Trek star the opportunity to be among the first extraterrestrial tourists because of his links with space. But the billionaire said the 82-year-old Canadian actor turned down the offer because he's scared to take to the skies. 'He actually said he's frightened of airline travel - which is slightly disillusioning. Captain Kirk is scared of flying,' the Sun quoted Sir Richard as saying. But Shatner, who played the all-action, alien-romancing captain of the starship Enterprise in 79 episodes of the original Sixties series and seven subsequent Star Trek films, has a slightly different story. After he was given an honorary doctorate of Letters at his alma mater, Montreal’s McGill University, in 2011, he told reporters that Sir Richard had expected him to foot the £125,000 ($200,000) bill. 'I said, ""Well, that’s not much, how much do you guarantee to come back?"" And he didn’t have a price on that,' quipped Shatner. 'He wanted me to go up and pay for it and I said: ""Hey, you pay me and I’ll go up. I’ll risk my life for a large sum of money."" But he didn’t pick me up on my offer.' That wasn't the first time he had indicated his reluctance to be blasted into the unknown. Five . years earlier Shatner said: 'I'm interested in man's march into the . unknown but to vomit in space is not my idea of a good time. 'Neither is a fiery crash with the vomit hovering over me.' According to Sir Richard, 63, rockers Muse are the latest big names to enquire about joining him on his pioneering flight. But he added that they too would have to find the cash for their fares. 'We . have a policy that however famous people are they won't get upgrades or . freebies,' he said, adding that he thought Muse would be able to afford . tickets. 'Slightly disillusioning': Sir Richard Branson, left, said Shatner, right, now 82, had told him he's even afraid of airline travel. Shatner two years ago said Virgin should be paying him to take part in such a risky adventure . The Virgin Galactic SpaceShipTwo: The . spacecraft, also known as the VSS Enterprise in homage to Star Trek, . earlier this month carried out its second powered test flight. the first . commercial flights are planned for 2014 . Virgin Galactic earlier this month carried out its second powered test flight of its spaceship VSS Enterprise, breaking the sound barrier and climbing higher than ever before. Its manned spacecraft has become the highest commercial winged vehicle to ever fly and it flexed its shuttlecock-inspired 'feather system' for the first time, which is used for safely re-entering the Earth's atmosphere. The flight took place over the Mojave desert and was piloted by Mark Stucky and Clint Nichols and lasted approximately an hour. The company says it is preparing to launch its first spaceflights next year and claims to have sold 700 tickets so far.","Sir Richard gave William Shatner the chance because of his links with space .

"Britain faces paying £40million-a-month in fines if David Cameron refuses to pay the EU's surprise demand for an extra £1.7billion by December 1. Brussels officials revealed interest would be charged at 2.5 per cent for every month the UK fails to pay, rising higher still if it drags on for months. However, the Prime Minister's hopes of rebuffing the demand were boosted last night as Italy insisted there is a 'widespread willingness to find a solution to this issue'. Scroll down for video . Britain has been told to pay £1.7billion by December 1, on top of the £8billion-a-year it already pays. France, Germany and Denmark are among those told they will get money back from Brussels . The European Commission issued the demand last month after using rules dating back to 1995 and finding Britain's economy has grown faster than expected, so must pay a greater share to Brussels. To add insult to injury, France will receive a £790million rebate because its economy is struggling. Bizarrely, Germany is also in line for a rebate while countries like Greece and Italy must pay more. Mr Cameron has angrily insisted he will not bow to the demands, declaring: 'I am not paying that bill on December 1. If people think I am, they have got another thing coming. It is not going to happen.' However, the UK is now being warned that it will face fines for not paying, levied through increasing interest payments. European Commission spokesman Margaritis Schinas said: ' 'Each member state has to pay what is due. If payment is not made by 1 December there is a process of interest being accumulated.' Britain faces an interest rate based on the base rate of the Bank of England – 0.5 per cent – plus an additional two per cent. This would be 2.5 per cent for the first month, worth an extra £42million. The interest rate would then rise by an extra by 0.25 per cent per month. By the end of 2015 it would reach 5.5 per cent, or £93.5million. Meanwhile Italy, which faces a bill of almost £270million and holds the EU's rotating presidency, has signalled it is keen to strike a deal to avoid a prolonged legal wrangle. Chancellor George Osborne said the EU was 'causing problems for us' – and warned the continent was 'pricing itself out of the world economy' An Italian government source said: 'This is not the end of the story. There is a widespread willingness to find a solution to this issue.' Chancellor George Osborne will use a meeting of EU finance ministers in Brussels on Friday to lobby for changes to the bill. Downing Street says the government is still examining the detail of the rules used by EU officials to calculate the astonishing demand, linked to better than expected economy growth. Mr Osborne warned that the EU is 'not working for Britain' and warned the continent was 'pricing itself out of the world economy'. He told the BBC's Newsnight programme: 'Britain joined [the EU] for economic reasons, and when it's not working economically for Britain that's why we get this debate about the membership of the EU and the nature of that membership. 'I'm someone who wants to stay in the EU, I think that's right for Britain, but it has to be a reformed EU.' He said that the EU was 'morphing more and more into a eurozone focused on the survival of its currency'. He added: 'It's perfectly all right for the UK to say as the big country that's not in the euro, this relationship is not working properly for us.' Britain faces the biggest increase to its payments covering the last four years. The UK is being asked for an extra 2.1billion euros. Preliminary figures show that the Netherlands will have to pay an extra €642million (£506million), while Germany will receive a rebate of €779million (£614million), France €1billion (£790million) and Poland €316million (£250million). Mr Cameron has formed alliances with the Netherlands, Malta, Italy and Greece - who all face bills worth millions - in an attempt to force a change of heart.","EU officials reveal 2.5% interest charge for Britain, rising to 5.5% next year .

"The U.S. Army made a public apology after saying the term 'Negro' was an acceptable term for black personnel back in October. The revised policy now limits the acceptable terms to 'Black or African American.' The decision to change the policy came two days after it was said to be an appropriate term to refer to 'a person having origins in any of the black racial groups of Africa' in section 6-2 of the Army's AR 600-20 regulations. Regulations:  An Army policy published as recently as October 22 said that Negro is an OK term for, 'a person having origins in any of the black racial groups of Africa' 'The U.S. Army fully recognized, and promptly acted, to remove outdated language in Army Regulation 600-20 as soon as it was brought to our attention,' Army spokeswoman Lieutenant Colonel Alayne Conway said in a statement. 'We apologize to anyone we offended,' she said. The New York Daily News reports that 21% of active-duty members of the Army are black. Even the U.S Census Bureau used the term Negro on its forms up until last year. The Census officials said that some older black Americans identify with the term but that others feel that it is outdated and offensive. Outdated: 'The Army takes pride in sustaining a culture where all personnel are treated with dignity and respect and not discriminated against based on race, color, religion...' said an official . CNN reported that the regulations also said that 'Haitian' is an acceptable term. An Army spokesman named Lt. Col. S. Justin Platt came forward after CNN brought the terminology to light. He said, 'The racial definitions in AR600-20 para. 6-2 are outdated, currently under review, and will be updated shortly.' They finally were. 'The Army takes pride in sustaining a culture where all personnel are treated with dignity and respect and not discriminated against based on race, color, religion, gender and national origin,' he added. An Army official defended the document to CNN by saying that the word Negro must have been added to it because a man chose to 'self-report' that he liked being called by that word. A Military officer specializing in personnel issues for the Defence Department told CNN that excuse 'the dumbest thing I have ever heard.' He also told CNN that the Pentagon doesn't use that word in any of its far-reaching collection of demographic data.","'We apologize to anyone we offended,'said Army spokeswoman Lieutenant Colonel Alayne Conway .

"A World War Two veteran who wrote poetry during lulls in fighting on the front line has secured a publishing deal at the age of 91. Dennis Wilson scribbled verse in his official Field Service Pocket Book as he sheltered in slit trenches during the 1944 D-Day landings. The 22-year-old soldier wrote about the horror of war and the life-changing injuries he sustained during enemy action in Normandy. Dennis Wilson has had his poems published 68 years after he wrote them on the battlefields of Normandy . 'The Wilfred Owen of World War Two': Dennis was 22 when he was sent to war in northern France . He even ripped pages from his book . and sent copies home to his mother in Southampton, Hampshire, so his . work would survive if he died in battle. Now . Dennis has finally made it into print after a researcher at Goldsmiths . College, University of London, read his collection of poems. Tim . Crook, who lectures on propaganda and the use of information in war, . described Dennis as the 'Wilfred Owen of World War Two'. He discovered the poems while writing a book on Dennis’s father Alexander Wilson, who worked as a spy and wrote espionage novels. Recognition: Dennis was offered the publishing deal after a researcher found his poems in his mother's papers . Dedicated: Dennis learned to write with his left hand after being injured, and continues to write today . Dennis joined the Royal Artillery in . 1941 as a lance bombardier but was sent to Normandy with the 1st . Tyneside Scottish Battalion, the black watch. He was in Rauray, France, for 21 days, during which time he witnessed horrific scenes that still haunt him to this day. Injured in shelling, he returned to England with a broken right arm, damaged hip and ripped bladder. The anthology of 125 poems 'covers profound human experiences and is drawn from a life spanning 92 years' But Dennis refused to give up poetry and continued to work from his hospital bed after learning to write with his left hand. Dennis, . who now lives in Southampton, says: 'I have read poetry all my life and . was gripped by poets such as Tennyson, Wordsworth and Keats at school. 'I lived my teenage years talking in couplets and felt compelled to write down my thoughts in the form of poems. Discovery: Senior lecturer Tim Crook found the poems . 'I . wrote my first poem at the age of 16. It was about Armistice Day and . how the young men who gave their lives should never be forgotten. 'That turned out to be the first of many, as I continued write throughout the war and even today. 'Many people think war is a continuous horror but you don’t face a continual barrage of bullets. 'There were quiet times in the trenches, when I was just sitting and waiting. 'It was at times like this that I pulled out my pocket book and wrote about the irony and tragedy of war as I saw it. 'I was not writing for an audience but did hope my poems would be published one day. 'I sent them to my mum to look after because I knew there was a risk I would fail to make it home.' Dennis describes his work as 'the reflections of an ordinary soldier, of any nationality, temporarily withdrawn from the front line to an area of comparative peace, in any of the wars to which unwilling Mankind has been subjected by the ambitions, greed or stupidity of his rulers'. What has war done to the Youth of the World? It has trained him; mentally to be alert always, and to think swiftly; . Physically to endure without food, without sleep, and often without hope. It has taught him to gaze on the friend who fell beside him in battle, . With less compassion and anger than inward relief: . Relief that the bullet found a heart other than his own; . But relief followed instantly by guilt that will never go away. It has taught him to think of the enemy framed in the sights of his rifle . Without pity, but with only the kill-or-be-killed instincts of the jungle; . And not as a man like himself, with an anxious wife and children; . With a small house, and a garden in which to rest on Summer ev’nings: . As a man who cares as little for the purpose of the war as he does himself, . And is even now thinking longingly of home...War has made him incurably restless, in a world grown madly impatient; . It has caused him to seek any form of gaudy entertainment promising forgetfulness. It had shown him there is nothing so mean, so lacking-in-glory as war; . And the common peoples of the earth desire only friendship and peace; . But there always will be war, because their Rulers and Mentors lead them away from peace. It has taught him that the common peoples must unite and destroy the causes of war . Before their Rulers fail again, and they perish with the whole of the species of Humankind . He hopes readers will reflect on the 'horrors' of war, 'I don’t think for one minute that my poems will stop people fighting but I do hope they will make people pause for a moment and think. 'Some of what I witnessed was so horrific it still pains me to talk about it. I only talk about those experiences with people who were there. 'On my final day on the frontline, we became surrounded by Germans and I was hit by shells as we tried to make our escape. 'I was in agony and initially thought I was going to lose my arm.'But I later realised I had been lucky and it was one of the happiest days of my life because it proved to be my ticket out of there.' Dennis dedicated one poem to a nurse who cared for him as he recovered from his injuries. He says he is 'delighted' to have secured a publishing deal 'because it shows my work has a commercial value. 'It is now being read by more people, who can learn about the horrors of war. 'It is an honour to be mentioned in the same breath as poets like Wilfred Owen.' Dennis was posted to Scotland after he was discharged from hospital, having fully recovered. There he met his barmaid wife Maisie, with whom he had two children. On leaving the army Dennis secured a job with the Encylopaedia Britannica, where he worked until his retirement. Maisie died 12 years ago. Senior lecturer Tim Crook says 'Dennis is devoted to literature and poetry and his own collection of poems is a treasure trove. 'He has a wonderful technique, which he combines with feeling and insight to produce something very special. 'He captures the despair, fear and sadness of war like the poetic greats of World War One, such as Wilfred Owen and Seigfried Sassoon. 'I was very moved by his work and believed his work deserved a wider audience. It is now selling very well.' Dennis’ book, called Elegy of a Common Soldier, contains 125 poems and is published by Kultura Press.","Dennis Wilson was 22 when he was sent to Normandy for D-Day landings .

"Sharks and crocodiles are predators in their own right, but who would win a fight if the two creatures came up against each other? The answer is a crocodile - at least if this photo is anything to go by. Andrew Paice, 43, managed to capture the moment this 5.5 metre crocodile named Brutus latched onto a bull shark in the Northern Territory before it swam off into the mangroves to devour its prey. Scroll down for video . This is the moment a 5.5 metre crocodile named Brutus latched onto a bull shark in the Northern Territory on Tuesday .

The ordeal took place in Kakadu's Adelaide River on Tuesday when Mr Paice was on a river cruise with his partner Nikki and seven-year-old daughter Madison. 'The tour guide had Brutus jumping at some meat the first time we went past him. Brutus is quite well known up here… he jumps really high for an old crocodile,' he told Daily Mail Australia. 'We were near the end of the tour and we'd fed all of the crocodiles along the river. We were on our way back to the jetty when we saw (the crocodile) had something in his mouth.' The tour guide, Morgan from Adelaide River Cruises, backed the boat back just as Brutus the crocodile was on the river bank with the shark in its mouth. 'The shark was definitely alive... it was still wriggling. The crocodile slid back into the water and the shark started to flip around a bit. The the crocodile swam into the mangroves, I guess to protect his catch,' Mr Paice said. 'I never even thought about a crocodile catching a shark before. It was absolutely amazing to see.

"A North Carolina race that encourages young women to dress like sexy schoolgirls was canceled by organizers, citing 'community controversy.' Sexy Schoolgirl 5K race organizers told Raleigh city officials on Thursday they were canceling the race. Young women dressed as sexy schoolgirls are seen in several images on the group's social media pages. The photos include captions like 'I don't sweat, I sparkle' and 'Friends don't let friends run sexy alone.' Family friendly? A Sexy Schoolgirl 5K scheduled to take place in Raleigh was cancelled by organizers on Thursday, who cited 'community controversy' The group's website encourages participants to 'pull up those knee socks, strap on those suspenders, and come join the fun!' The coed races, which do not have a strict dress code, are also normally followed by a pub crawl. Race participants must be 18 and older. Former Raleigh police captain Paula O'Neal criticized the race to town council members. O'Neal said 'I question the message that is being sent and endorsed by the City of Raleigh due to the increasing problem of rape and violence against girls in the schools and on college campuses,' The News & Observer of Raleigh reports. Other factors in the race's cancellation include 'a lack of early sign-ups and inadequate organization,' the paper said.

Costume party: A Raleigh former police captain questioned the race, 'due to the increasing problem of rape and violence against girls in the schools and on college campuses' MATHCOUNTS, however, said in a statement that it distanced itself from the Sexy Schoolgirl 5K race after it was 'made aware of some of the materials that were designed by the race organizers to promote the race.' 'MATHCOUNTS has informed the race organizers that we do not want to be associated with this event, and that they should remove all reference to MATHCOUNTS from their website and marketing materials,' the organization said. 'Furthermore, we have informed them that we will not accept any donations made from the proceeds of this race. 'At this point, . multiple attempts to contact race organizers by MATHCOUNTS have been unanswered . and they continue to list us on their materials despite our formal request to . have it removed.'

Mary-Ann Baldwin, another council member, told MailOnline she was 'relieved' the race was cancelled. 'I didn't want to get in a war over this,' she said in an email exchange. 'You want to give people the freedom to express themselves and have fun. But I felt this went overboard. It sends the wrong message to young women and devalues them. 'The organizers did the right thing in canceling. But I hope they also do the right thing and run races for charity that are more inspired and respectful.'

"Kurdish resistance forces  have this morning symbolically raised their flag over the Kobane hillside where the Islamic State's black jihadist banner was destroyed in a devastating American airstrike only hours before. In a series of dramatic images, ISIS militants were seen standing by the flag on Tilsehir hill near the Turkish border yesterday afternoon  - after the terrorist group seized control of the strategically important hilltop, which lies two and a half miles to the west of the town.

Yesterday's massive airstrike came after the terrorist group made a renewed assault on Kobane after being pushed out of the centre of the besieged Syrian city by hundreds of brave Kurdish resistance fighters . The YPG forces are believed to have made their massive advances by coordinating fierce street battles with the American and Arab bombing raids - forcing the well-equipped jihadis to retreat into the outskirts of Kobane. One key location the jihadists managed to retain, however, was the strategically important Tilsehir hill in the Kobane suburbs - where the chilling site of their black flag has been flying for the past three weeks. All that changed yesterday evening, when American warplanes carried out the massive airstrike that destroyed the ISIS flag and allowed the brave Kurdish troops to symbolically raise their own banner over Tilsehir. Although the bulk of ISIS have now been pushed outside Kobane, small cells are still thought to operating inside the city. Yesterday the group's flag could clearly still be seen inside city, raised over a multi-storey building just a few hundred feet away from where the yellow, triangular flag of the Kurdish People's Protection Unit (YPG) was seen fluttering above a largely destroyed housing complex. The chilling image of the ISIS flag still flying in Kobane emerged as lawmakers in Iraq's largely autonomous Kurdish region authorized peshmerga forces to cross into neighboring Syria to help fellow Kurds combat Islamic State militants in the city, providing much-needed boots on the ground. The unprecedented deployment will almost certainly depend on the support of Turkey, whose president criticized a U.S. airdrop of arms to Kurdish fighters after some of the weapons wound up in the hands of the extremists.

Smoke and dust is seen rising over the Syrian town of Kobane after U.S. warplanes carry out a bombing raid on Islamic State targets . Turkey, which has riled Kurdish leaders and frustrated Washington by refusing to allow fighters or weapons into Kobane, said this week it would help Iraqi Kurdish fighters cross into Syria to help their brethren against the militants, who also are being attacked by a U.S.-led campaign of airstrikes. But it is not clear how many fighters will be allowed in or whether they will be allowed to carry enough weapons to make an impact. The Kurds of Syria and Iraq have become a major focal point in the war against the Islamic State group, with Kurdish populations in both countries coming under significant threat by the militants' lightning advance. Lt. Gen. Frederick Hodges, the outgoing commander of NATO's Land Command in Izmir, Turkey, said the Turks have agreed to open up 'a land bridge of sorts' so that the peshmerga can get into Kobane to help with the fighting there. 'It seems to me that between the United States, Turkey and other countries, they are figuring out what is permissible to make sure that ISIL is not successful and that it is something that Turkey can live with,' he added, using an acronym for the group.","Resistance fighters this morning raised their yellow flag over Tilsehir hill, which ISIS had held for several weeks .

"Preachers of hate are to be ‘silenced’ with new anti-terror orders based on a dramatically tightened definition of extremism and attempts to block their bile on the internet. The Government is to introduce new civil powers, similar to those used against anti-social behaviour, to target extremists who radicalise others. They are expected to be used to bar people from preaching messages of terror and hate, associating with named individuals thought vulnerable to radicalisation, and from entering specific venues, such as mosques or community halls. Silence: David Cameron wants to silence hate preachers by bringing in new anti-terror orders . The move is part of a sweeping package of measures drawn up by an anti-extremism task force set up by David Cameron after the death of Drummer Lee Rigby in Woolwich. In its initial report to be detailed . to Parliament today, the task force will also propose new internet . filters to block extremist websites and extended powers for watchdogs to . shut down charities suspected of being fronts for extremist groups. ‘I want to see an end to hate preaching in Britain,’ the Prime Minister said. As well as new civil orders against . extremists – dubbed ‘Tebos’, or terror and extremism behaviour orders – . the Government is to consider the case for another new type of order to . ban groups which ‘seek to undermine democracy or use hate speech, when . necessary to protect the public or prevent crime and disorder’. Controversially, both types of order are to be based on a new definition of extremism which specifically includes a ‘distorted interpretation of Islam’. It identifies Islamist extremism as a distinct ideology which should not be confused with traditional  religious practice. This ‘distorted’ view argues for a global Islamic state and against ‘liberal values such as democracy, the rule of law and equality’, and tells people they cannot be both Muslim and British. The Government is also working with internet firms to remove hate-filled websites including material that would be illegal if published in the UK. Family-friendly filters being made standard for web users to block porn will also be expanded to block extremist material, allowing concerned families and institutions to filter out such websites. Mr Cameron said: ‘This summer we saw events that shocked the nation with the horrific killing of Drummer Lee Rigby in Woolwich and murder of Mohammed Saleem in Birmingham. ‘These tragedies were a wake-up call for government and wider society to take action to confront extremism in all its forms, whether in our communities, schools, jails, Islamic centres or universities. 'I have been absolutely clear that this is not something we should be afraid to address for fear of cultural sensitivities. 'We have already put in place some of the toughest terrorism prevention controls in the democratic world, but we must work harder to defeat the radical views which lead some people to embrace violence. ‘The task force I set up has proposed a broad range of measures to counter the extremist narrative. When you look at this report, you can see a very clear analysis, a very . clear definition of the extremism we’re talking about ... now everyone . can see what it is that we need to tackle.’ He added: ‘There are just too . many people who have been radicalised at Islamic centres, who have been . in contact with extremist preachers, who have come across material on . the internet who haven’t been sufficiently challenged.’ ‘Some institutions have wanted to get rid of radicalisers but haven’t had the means to do so,’ he added. Powers: The move is part of a sweeping package of measures drawn up by an anti-extremism task force set up by David Cameron after the death of Drummer Lee Rigby in Woolwich . The task force includes Home Secretary Theresa May, Deputy Premier Nick Clegg, Minister for Faith Baroness Warsi, and has taken advice from police and intelligence chiefs. Other proposals include legally requiring intervention by local authorities in 30 areas identified as radicalism hotspots.","Government to introduce new powers, similar to an ASBO .

"Google Glass has caused controversy with concerns its recording capability is a breach of privacy . Google Glass users have been warned they risk breaking the law by using the devices to film people secretly. The data privacy watchdog has told buyers of the £1,000 ‘wearable technology’ that they could be prosecuted if they mis-use recordings, or face fines of up to £500,000. The Information Commissioner's Office said wearers are effectively covered by the same rules as CCTV cameras, meaning they cannot record people on their glasses and show the films publicly unless they have consent. The warning comes after the devices went on sale in Britain for the first time this week. Andrew Paterson, senior technology officer, warned that using the recording capability of Google Glass for anything other than personal use was forbidden unless the wearer had given warning in advance. Much like a smartphone, the wearable Google Glass provides information and recordings via a display screen inside the glasses' lens. By issuing the voice command 'Ok, Glass' - said to have been the brainchild of Google co-founder Sergey Brin's new girlfriend - you can activate it and then issue voice commands, including recording video and taking photographs. Scroll down for video . Google co-founder Sergey Brin's girlfriend Amanda Rosenberg is said to have got her job with Google after creating the 'Ok, Glass' phrase used to issue voice commands . Amanda Rosenberg, Diane von Furstenberg and Google co-founder Sergey Brin all wearing the new technology at the New York Fashion Week . An early version of the device has just . been released to the UK public despite the controversy and privacy . concerns raised during its release in the U.S. Mr Paterson, who works for the Information Commissioner's Office, wrote that using the technology strictly for your own use would be unlikely to breach data privacy laws. Glass Explorer . The term Google has given to Google Glass users.

Ok, Glass . The phrase a Google Glass wearer uses when wearing the product to activate the glasses and issue a voice command. Glass hole . An obvious spin on the more common phrase for someone who is a pest, obnoxious, rude or a jerk - specifically, one wearing Google Glass. Glass out . The term given to those who appear to be staring vacantly into the distance while they are focusing on their Google Glass display screen. This falls under Google's 'do not' category and is considered poor etiquette. This is . because the laws include an exemption for the collection of personal . information for domestic purposes. 'But . if you were to one day decide that you’d like to start using this . information for other purposes outside of your personal use, for example . to support a local campaign or to start a business, then this exemption . would no longer apply.' He warned that organisations' use of wearable technology were an entirely different proposition to individuals. 'They must process the information collected by these devices in compliance with the legislation,' he said. 'This includes making sure that people are being informed about how their details are being collected and used, only collecting information that is relevant, adequate and not excessive and ensuring that any information that needs to be collected is kept securely and deleted once it is no longer required.' If the organisation was recording video or pictures, then it must consider the issues raised in the CCTV Code of Practice, he said. The product's rollout in the . U.S. has been far from smooth, with reports of users being publicly assaulted and San Francisco bars banning the product due to . concerns from their patrons about being filmed without their consent. Google said: 'We designed Glass with privacy in mind and given the similarities between the functionality of a smartphone and Glass we expect the same rules to apply.

"Those who saw the eight men riding into town that morning would later recall an uneasy feeling that rippled in their wake. Druggist George Bates watched them cross the iron bridge, the sound of their horses’ hooves briefly drowned out by the rush of water into the mill dam below, and worried at their ‘reckless, bold swagger.’ He judged them ‘dangerous men to handle. ‘ He was right. It was 10am, 7 September 1876. Northfield was about to experience ‘the hottest day it ever saw.’ And the James-Younger gang were about to embark on the disastrous bank job that today stands in history as the raid that both sparked their downfall and cemented the legend of their most infamous member, Jesse James. Sixteen years old and already a cold-blooded killer, Jesse James, above, fought in the Civil War - after that, his brother said, they could only ever be outlaws . Now a compelling new book has chronicled that day, the epic manhunt that followed and the fates of the gang members up to Jesse James’s assassination and beyond.. In ‘Shot All To Hell: Jesse James, The Northfield Raid, And the Wild West’s Greatest Escape’ award-winning author and historian Mark Lee Gardner reveals the workings of the gang, using previously unseen documents and eye-witness accounts. He reveals the catastrophic miscalculation that led to the chaos that left two robbers and two townsfolk dead. He charts the extraordinary escape across 14 days and some of the country’s most forbidding terrain that drew admiration from the lawmen hunting the criminals down and citizens following their story. And he names the man who shot Jesse James as Robert Ford. A member of the gang James himself formed after the James-Younger crew fell apart. The iron bridge over which the James-Younger Gang rode into Northfield on that fateful day in 1876 - the 'hottest day Northfield ever saw.' Ford cut James down as he stood to adjust a picture in the parlour of his home. James was parnoid after a life on the run and had invited Ford and his brother Charles to live with him and his wife Zee and protect them. Instead the man who had survived shooting battles and daring raids, died as he had lived; by the bullet and for bounty. While his wife wept by her dying husband’s side Bob and Charley Ford, Mr Gardner writes: ‘Quickly grabbed their hats and also Jesse’s revolvers and gun belt and hurried off for the town’s only telegraph office. ‘Once there, Charley paced nervously…as Bob tried several times to write out a telegram.’ When he finally handed a piece of paper to the operator it read as follows: ‘Meet me in Kansas City tonight or tomorrow. I have my man.' Clell Miller, left, and Bill Chadwell, right, in death: shot down by the people of Northfield and left in the dust . Bob Younger, left, wounded in the Northfield raid and brother Jim, above, captured . The telegram was addressed to Thomas Crittenden, Governor of Missouri who had placed a $10,000 reward on Jesse, dead - $40,000 if he was taken alive but no-one really believed Jesse James would be taken alive. ‘If you hear they’ve captured me alive,’ he once said to a cousin. ‘Say it’s a lie; they may kill me, but they will never get me otherwise.’ That they captured him at all was an event that, according to Mr Gardner, had its beginnings in the chaos of Northfield, Minnesota and the raid on the town’s First National Bank. Brothers Jesse and Frank, four years his senior, had been riding and raiding with Cole and Bob Younger since the end of the Civil War. Along with Clell Miller, Bill Chadwell and Charlie Pitts they made up the Younger-James gang. If the James brothers had been brutal to begin with a botched attempt to arrest them at their home only hardened their resolve. Officers were one day too late to catch the gangsters but their 8 year old brother was killed and their mother maimed in the attempt. They were feared and rightly so. James, with his bright blue eyes and horsemanship was a dazzling sort of figure by all accounts but the glint in those eyes was steel. He murdered without missing a beat – all of them did. The gang had chosen Northfield, Minnesota because it was small and thought to be peaceable. But most importantly there was only one bank and recent newspaper stories had reported that a new safe and time lock and two heavy doors for the vault had just been added to First National’s building. This didn’t put the gang off. They reasoned the threat of a gun would be enough to persuade most men to unlock a vault. It just meant that all the money in town was in one place and if there was enough of it to make it worth investing in a such security there was enough to make it worth robbing. Scene of the crime: Inside Nortfield's First National Bank, the vault door that Joseph Heywoods attempted to shut with fatal consequences is clearly visible . Blueprint of a disaster: The floorplan for First National at the time of the raid, Heywood's desk at the door to the vault is to the top right the positions of tellers Wilcox and Bunker (wounded in the raid) are shown at the bottom of the plan . The day they rode into Northfield they were ‘at the top of their game.’ Mr Gardner writes: ‘They excelled at deception..As outlaws they took on aliases, stopped trains or emptied bank vaults while moving freely in public telling people they were livestock dealers, businessmen or land speculators.’ Yet something was amiss from the start at Northfield. They did attract attention.  Jesse James once stated, ‘It is true we are robbers, but we always rob in the glare of the day and in the teeth of the multitude.’ But Northfield was the town that bit back. Cuckoo in the next: Robert Ford lived with Jesse James who had asked him to protect him. Instead he shot him dead for $10,000 in cash . The bank staff resisted. Frustrated, Frank James fired shots above bookkeeper Joseph Heywood’s head. In the smoke and confusion a colleague though he had been shot and made a run for it,bringing more shots from the robber. Everything began to unravel. The town was alerted to the raid taking place. All their money was held in that building – all uninsured. They decided to fight. The gun battle lasted less than ten minutes – panicked the gang members who had been keeping watched dashed to and fro amid bullets and rocks that arced through the air as locals fought with anything to hand. Inside all was confusion and violence. Mr Gardner states,‘While the townspeople were shooting to kill, the outlaws’ shots were really meant to frighten, to scare away, to buy time – at least in the beginning.’ Keeping watch outside, panic growing Cole Younger signalled the retreat: ‘For God’s sake,’ he shouted. ‘Come out. They are shooting us all to pieces.’ When it was over robbers Clell Miller and Bill Chadwell lay dead in the street. Bookkeeper Joseph Heywood had a bullet in his head and another local had been killed in the frenzy outside.  The gang’s haul totalled just $26.60 ‘in coin and crip.’ Bob Coles had been hit. They left, six men on five horses and for the next 14 days evaded captuer in what became the largest manhunt in US history. More than 1000 men chased them across marsh and woodland. Cole Younger later recalled: ‘We suffered in those fourteen days a hundred deaths.’ The public followed the tale with horror and excitement as reporters wrote of the robbers’ escape with undisguised awe. Mr Gardner quotes one report in the local news: ‘Here were six men hunted by a thousand…Every device was resorted to. Every rod of a vast extent of country was searched. The best detective talent employed. The best woodsmen were engaged in the hunt. Mark Lee Gardner's account of the Northfield raid and the chain of events it set off is the most detailed yet . ‘Yet in the face and eyes of eager pursuers they have passed through the most carefully arranged traps. ‘Such determination, daring and perseverance..cannot but evoke the admiration even of those who most desire their extermination.’ Ultimately his brother’s wound slowed them down. Cole wouldn’t leave him so the James brothers split from the rest and the gang as it had been known and feared ceased to exist. The straggling gang members were arrested and convicted. The James brothers notoriety grew as they continued to evade capture. Had they been able to live the new lives they ultimately both established as farmers in Tennessee that might have been that. But for Jesse, Mr Gardner writes: ‘The rush of that wind-in-your-face, gun-in-your-hand lifestyle was like a drug.’ He craved attention. He craved notoriety. He started a new gang. But it had none of the ‘honour’ of his old brothers in arms. Jesse James was shot on 3 April 1882. He was 34 years old. Terrified of suffering a similar fate - older brother Frank gave himself up. Nobody knows the details of the deal he struck, but the man who rode as part of the most notorious gang in the Wild West was never charged with a single crime. Instead he returned to the Missouri farm where he and Jesse were raised, giving tours for 75 cents. He died age 72. As for Jesse, the last sound he heard was the click of the metallic hammer as Robert Ford cocked his revolver and took aim. But his fate had been sealed years earlier, on 3 September 1876, at the First National Bank in Northfield. It was the day James’s legend was cemented and it was the day his luck truly ran out.

"After a slow start to the season followed by a lengthy injury lay-off, some Arsenal fans were beginning to doubt the abilities of German playmaker Mesut Ozil. Following a long, and ultimately successful, World Cup campaign, Ozil had failed to hit the ground running when he returned to North London. But since recovering from a knee injury which kept him out of the team for over three months, the star has rediscovered the form that led Arsene Wenger to spend £42million to bring him to England from Real Madrid.

Recoveries                 6 . Shots on target          2 . Successful crosses    100% . Chances created        7 . Ozil has three goals and two assists in just five starts since his return from injury, and is linking brilliantly with Arsenal's newest star Alexis Sanchez. That compares favourably with the one goal and two assists he managed in the nine games before injuring himself against Chelsea in October. To cap it all off, Ozil produced a superb display in Sunday's FA Cup win over Middlesbrough, to keep up his perfect record in the competition. Ozil has won all seven of his FA Cup games since joining Arsenal at the beginning of last season . Middlesbrough manager Aitor Karanka asked the Arsenal star for his shirt after the game on Sunday . Ozil celebrates with fans after winning the FA Cup last season, and he is still unbeaten in the competition .

Since moving to the Emirates in 2013, Ozil has played seven FA Cup ties, winning all of them. The German midfielder helped the Gunners end their trophy drought at Wembley last season, and has now played a big part in the side reaching the quarter-finals as they look to defend the cup. During Sunday's game against Middlesbrough he created seven chances, the most of any player in the cup this weekend, and was so good that Boro boss Aitor Karanka even asked him for his shirt at the end of the game. Since returning to the Arsenal team Ozil has scored three goals and provided two assists . The German midfielder scores against Tottenham at White Hart Lane to continue his prolific form .

"Downing Street has a new resident – the long-lost cat Chancellor George Osborne and his family had assumed has vanished for ever. Tabby Freya was just a few months old when she went missing from the Osbornes’ Notting Hill home three years ago. Mr Osborne, wife Frances and their two young children Luke and Liberty searched the streets of West London and put up ‘lost’ posters, but to no avail. Back where she belongs: Freya the cat is settling in at Downing Street after being reunited with the Osborne family . They gave up hope long before moving into Downing Street last year, assuming the cat had got lost – or worse, been run over. So they transferred their affections to the family budgie, Gibson, named after RAF Dambusters hero Guy Gibson, and two goldfish. But two weeks ago, Frances, an author, received a phone call telling her Freya was alive and well. She had been living as a stray in a garden a few streets away from the Osbornes’ Notting Hill house, lovingly fed and looked after by a neighbour who had not seen the posters. Nice surprise: The Chancellor and his family had given up hope of finding Freya after she went missing three years ago . Freya, looking particularly well-nourished, was reunited with the Osbornes after a visit to a vet revealed a microchip beneath its skin bearing Mrs Osborne’s phone number. A few days later, Freya, looking fit and healthy, was installed in Downing Street. This time, they took no chances, keeping Freya indoors until she could get acclimatised to her new surroundings. The Osbornes live in the flat above No 10, which they moved into more than a year after the 2010 Election, while the Camerons live above No 11. Before Freya was let loose in the garden, one vital matter  had to be dealt with: a formal introduction to Larry, the Camerons’ cat. Fortunately for all, the fur did not fly, and yesterday Freya was allowed outside. A Treasury spokesman said: ‘She is settling in nicely and getting on well with family, staff and Larry.’ Neighbour: The Camerons' cat Larry (pictured) is getting on well with Freya .

'We are so blessed to have had Kim . in our family because she was truly a one-of-a-kind soul,' her family . said in a statement released to the organization. Heartbreaking: A funeral was held for Pham on Tuesday at Blessed Sacrament Church in Westminster, California- just three days before what would have been her first wedding anniversary. Her husband was a pallbearer . Hundreds of mourners ca\me to pay their respects . Disturbing: Police were quick to announce that they did not believe the attack was motivated by race, as the area has a large Vietnamese community that were concerned about a possible hate crime . 'She always put . others' needs before herself and never thought badly of anyone. She kept . love in the center of her life and preached kindness and respect for . others. 'We will always remember her as a sweet, vibrant, and wise . daughter, sister, and friend. She is our little angel and God's gift to . all of us.' So far two women are in police custody . and investigators have released the photo of a third woman that they . think may have information pertaining to the attack. Vanesa . Tapia Zavala, 25, was arrested on Monday and is accused of taking part . in the early morning beating. She entered a not guilty plea but remains . in police custody on $1million bail. She faces 15 years to life in . prison if convicted. Candace . Marie Brito, 27, has been identified as the second suspect and has been . arrested for her alleged involvement in the attack. She entered a plea . of not guilty. Brito’s attorney said that the coverage . the case has gotten in the area, which has a sizeable Vietnamese . population, is hindering his client’s chances of receiving a fair trial. ‘Ms. Pham has been anointed a saint and the people on the other side- specifically, my client and Mr. Reed’s client (Zavala)- have been vilified internationally,’ attorney Michael Molfetta told KTLA. Charged: Vanesa Tapia Zavala, 25, was charged with one felony count of murder (left) and now Candace Marie Brito (right) has also been arrested in connection to the attack . Information: Police have released this photo of an unknown person of interest in the case as they believe she may know something about the case . ‘This young lady died tragically; she died unnecessarily. ‘What . occurred out there — whatever occurred out there — was stupid, was . mindless, was senseless and should never have resulted in the death of . anybody, much less a young person.’ A . third woman’s photo has been released in hopes that someone will . recognize her and help the police get in touch with her as they believe . she has some information about the incident. The Los Angeles Times . reports that one of Ms Pham’s friends who was not at the nightclub at . the time of the attack heard that Ms Pham accidentally walked into the . background of a photo and the subjects who had intended to be the focus . of the shot attacked her in retribution. Pham was beaten about 12.20am Saturday January 19 outside the Crosby Bar and Nightclub. She was declared brain-dead Sunday, but was kept on life support for two more days so her organs could be harvested. Pham and a group of friends were headed into the club as another group was coming out, and police say that something prompted the fight during that impasse. 'Three people at various times, depending on what video you look at, were involved physically with Ms Pham,' Santa Ana police chief Carols Rojas said to The Los Angeles Times. 'While there was a physical altercation, we don't know what precipitated it.' Zavala was identified through video taken by bystanders at the scene on their cell phones. Tragic: Ms Pham's husband led the pallbearers into the church and later into the crematorium . Thought-provoking: Ms Pham had previously blogged about ways to enjoy your 20s by avoiding self-doubt . Zavala's attorney, Kenneth Reed, told . reporters after his client's arraignment that she was knocked down . during the scramble, and he doubted reports that it was a beat-down. 'I . refuse to believe that people of this community would watch a woman . stomped to death by five people and nobody would do anything,' Reed . said. The lawyer characterized it as 'a melee, a bunch of people . fighting.' Reed says he’s . been contacted by one of the potential suspects – and friends of Pham . who say they’ve spoken with people involved in the incident – said the . violence outside the club was chaotic and involved at least a half-dozen . other people. Zavala lost . her phone in the brawl, and it was recovered later by police, according . to Reed, who said she is 'devastated' by the violence. 'Your day is fine, your life is fine, . you have a 5-year-old son, you go out one night on a Friday with your . boyfriend and then your life is turned upside down and you find out . someone is killed,' Reed said of his client. 'No matter what the situation is, you're going to be devastated.' Violent Police say a fight broke out between Pham and another woman, whose friends then stepped in . Brutal: A video that friends claimed showed the attack was shared on Facebook. It shows people trying to break up a fight in the street while someone is lying on the ground . The . fight that ended with Pham unconscious has drawn national attention as a . short video circulated online showing a group of people in nightclub . attire wrestling and kicking a figure on the ground in front of a crowd . of about 50 people. In the . video, one person is visible crouching to take another cellphone video. A . bouncer from the club appears to try to intervene, well after the . violence began. Her family . was shocked that Ms Pham would have been involved in a brawl, making it . even more likely that it was an unintentional slight that prompted the . altercation. ‘She would . go out of her way to help others and never expect anything back from . them’, her stepsister Lisa told The Los Angeles Times. ‘That’s the kind of person she is.’ Ms . Pham wrote an uplifting post on her personal blog that was later published on Elite Daily before her death, . titled ‘These Are the 7 Biggest Fears That You Need To Avoid Having In . Your Twenties’. In the post, she called on people her age to stop being . fearful. On the ‘Fear of Missing Out’, a rationale she said was ‘empty’, she wrote: ‘We all have this guilt that tells us we should be doing one thing when we choose to do another. Plea: Posters put near the crime scene appealing for information about the tragic January incident . ‘We may even choose to justify it by announcing it on Facebook or Twitter to receive likes and lighthearted comments that perhaps make us feel more at ease about being “out studying the babes instead of studying for a midterm.” Don’t be a fool. Attend to the things you need to do in order to grow a better you.’ She tells her contemporaries to stop worrying about ‘Not Being Invited to the party’, instead claiming that it is merely the universe’s way of ‘telling you that you’ve got more valuable things to be doing with your time’. On the scourge of social media, in the third part of her missive, ‘Fear That We Don’t Compare’, she wrote that spending hours stalking people online is pointless. ‘We are taught that with photos, we select the ones where smiles are fresh and forward — the good is often highlighted. As for your own life, don’t forget that sometimes the most beautiful lessons in life stem from the unconventional. The elevated focus on showing everyone how much of a superstar you are on social media is quite unnecessary.’ She explained that in ‘Fear of the Unknown, or What the Future Holds’: ‘The greatest harm we can do to ourselves is to not take the chance’. Other ‘Fears’ she addresses include ‘Fear of Being Lonely’, ‘Fear of Rejection’ and ‘Fear of Getting Hurt’ ‘Perhaps in our generation of self-promotion, egos yield a delicate tiptoe around the subject of getting hurt or being disappointed,’ she concludes. ‘However, we need to recognize that this fear should not paralyze us from feeling, living and loving. ‘If you are forthright in your own heart’s honest intent to love, you have nothing to worry about. Be bold, go forward, and love like hell.’","Kim Pham, 23, has been laid to rest after being taken off life support which was used to harvest her organs for donation .

"Lionel Messi would cost a whopping £172m should any of Barcelona's rivals want to whisk him away this month, according to research into the current market values of the world's leading players. The Argentine star comfortably tops a CIES Football Observatory countdown of football's most valuable players and is worth £68m more than his Real Madrid rival Cristiano Ronaldo. The totals serve as a 'guide price' for the January transfer window, using a calculation that takes into account player performance, age, contract and the results of their team. Barcelona star Lionel Messi is valued at a mammoth £172m in a January transfer 'price guide' Real Madrid hero Cristiano Ronaldo is priced at £104.3m in the CIES Football Observatory rankings . 1. Lionel Messi £172.6m . 2. Cristiano Ronaldo £104.3m . 3. Eden Hazard £77.6m . 4. Diego Costa £65.9m . 5. Paul Pogba £56.4m . 6. Sergio Aguero £51m . 7. Raheem Sterling £49.4m . 8. Cesc Fabregas £48.6m . 9. Alexis Sanchez £47.8m . 10. Gareth Bale £47m . The top 10 features six Premier League players - Eden Hazard, Diego Costa and Cesc Fabregas of Chelsea, Sergio Aguero of Manchester City, Raheem Sterling of Liverpool and Alexis Sanchez of Arsenal. But it finds Messi far and away the most expensive player in Europe at the moment. Ronaldo, the favourite to win the Ballon d'Or for the world's best player this month, is valued at £104.3m should someone try to prise him away from European champions Real. Chelsea's Eden Hazard comes in at a cool £77.6m, followed by his team-mate, the free-scoring Diego Costa at £65.9m. Paul Pogba, of Juventus and France, is fifth on the list at £56.4m while Manchester City's prolific Argentine Sergio Aguero is just above the £50m mark. Chelsea's Eden Hazard comes third in the transfer value list at £77.6m following good displays this season . Diego Costa's value continues to rise with the Football Observatory rating him at £65.9m . Paul Pogba of Juventus comes fifth in the ranking with an estimated market value of £56.4m . Liverpool's Sterling (£49.4m), Chelsea's Fabregas (£48.6m), Arsenal's Sanchez (£47.8m) and Real's Gareth Bale (£47m), who commanded the world's biggest transfer fee in 2013, complete the top 10. The values of everyone in the top 10 except Messi and Bale has increased since the last ranking was released in June. The CIES Football Observatory used their own algorithm based on 1,500 completed transfers since 2009 to work out the current 'price guide'. Manchester City striker Sergio Aguero is sixth on the list with an estimated value of £51m . Liverpool's Raheem Sterling is one of six Premier League players in the top 10 . Real Madrid's Gareth Bale comes 10th in the ranking on a predicted transfer fee of £47m . It also takes into consideration player performance such as goals, assists and other on-pitch stats as well as their age, position and contract duration. It also weighs up results achieved by their club and national teams. The star-studded list also features the likes of Neymar (11th, £45.4m), Angel Di Maria (12th, £44.6m), Luis Suarez (16th, £37.6m) and Radamel Falcao (60th, £21.9m). 1.

"The UK’s biggest sandwich maker wants to recruit hundreds of workers from Eastern Europe because no Britons will do the job. Bosses from Greencore Group are flying to Hungary today in search of staff for its new factory. The firm, which supplies Marks & Spencer, Waitrose, Sainsbury’s, Tesco and Asda, admits it will have to recruit most of the 300 workers it needs from overseas. Greencore (pictured) say they have failed to attract many applications from potential employees in Northampton - so bosses are now travelling to Hungary to recruit some of the 300-strong workforce needed . Its vacancy crisis will re-ignite claims that Britain’s generous welfare system has created a generation unwilling to work, while acting as a magnet for foreigners. Allyson Russell, Greencore’s human resources director, said the company had tried to recruit in the UK, but that it was ‘not always the kind of work’ which people wanted to do. Human resources director Allyson Russell (pictured) said most of the 300 new staff members will be recruited from Hungary after generating little interest from locals . The £35million factory, in Northampton, is due to open in early 2016. Mrs Russell said low unemployment meant few locals could be found to fill vacancies, although there are around 8,000 jobless in the town, a rate of 6.8 per cent – the national average – while in nearby Corby it is 9.5 per cent and Luton 8.7 per cent. In Hungary, the average wage is little more than £7,000. Even if workers coming here were on the minimum wage, they would earn almost double that – £13,520 a year. And they would have their wages topped up with tax credits – seen as a major attraction for EU migrants – and housing benefit. These mean a migrant with no dependants on the minimum wage has their net income of about £184 a week boosted to £254, studies have suggested. For those with a partner and two children, that rockets to £543 a week, equivalent to a salary of more than £28,000. Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith has claimed that the last Labour Government’s ‘open-door’ policy led to a huge influx of low-skilled migrant workers while its welfare system disincentivised Britons to work. Conservative MP Andrew Rosindell said: ‘This highlights why we have so many people coming here – because jobs are available and not everyone wants to take those jobs. Greencore staff hard at work in one of their factories - but bosses are struggling to find people who want to work in its new £35 million factory in Northampton, which is due to open in 2016 . Greencore's Food to Go business is one of the world's leading manufacturers of pre-packed sandwiches . People on benefits here should be willing to take any job.’ Greencore is not the only company to go to Eastern Europe in search of workers. Earlier this year, the Mail found British companies had placed almost 8,000 job adverts trying to recruit Romanian nurses, taxi drivers and hotel staff.","Greencore Group's new £35 million factory is due to open in 2016 .

"Owners of lawnmowers, mobility scooters and golf buggies may have to take out motor insurance under a new EU directive. It follows a ruling from the European Court of Justice that an accident involving a tractor trailer on private land should have been covered by compulsory insurance. Cover must now be obtained for ‘any motor vehicle intended for travel on land and propelled by mechanical power’. Dangerous: Graham Davies, 46, council gardener mows the grass on a ride-on lawnmower, which is just one of the kinds of vehicles that may now have to be covered by motor insurance under a new EU directive . UK ministers are worried the directive could even apply to ride-on lawnmowers because the definition of motor vehicles is so unclear. There is also concern that insurance costs could rise for all drivers. The ruling comes following a European legal case involving a Slovenian, Damijan Vnuk. He was hurt after falling from a ladder when it was hit by a reversing tractor trailer. Because it involved a vehicle being used as an ‘agricultural machine’ and took place on private property, motor insurers refused to cover the claim. In September, The European Court of Justice ruled the accident should have been covered by compulsory vehicle insurance. As a result, motor insurance is now required to cover vehicles used in all situations — not just on roads. The definition has also now been extended to ‘any motor vehicle intended for travel on land and propelled by mechanical power’. Tearaway: A man rides a mobility scooter, another of the vehicles that may be covered by the new ruling, which a Conservative party spokesman described as 'bonkers' Roads minister Robert Goodwill said that it would probably lead to a rise in insurance costs for all British motorists. They are charged an average £30 levy to cover accidents involving untraced or uninsured drivers – which he said would have to go up as the scope of motor insurance was broadened. Meanwhile, a Conservative party spokesman told The Times: ‘This is clearly a bonkers ruling. 'Only with David Cameron as PM will British people get a referendum on our membership of the EU.’","Vehicles may be included in new ruling from European Court of Justice .

"The deaf twins killed by euthanasia in Belgium chose to die because they 'had nothing to live for' after learning they would soon become blind, their brother revealed today. The 45-year-olds, named yesterday as Marc and Eddy Verbessem, had lived together their entire adult lives and could not communicate with the outside world. Their brother, Dirk Verbessem, said they were terrified of never being able to see each other and feared losing their independence in an institution. 'That was for my brothers unbearable,' said Mr Verbessem, 46. 'Did not want to end up in an institution: Deaf Belgian twins Marc and Eddy Verbessem chose to die by euthanasia because they feared losing their independence after learning they would also soon go blind . 'They lived together, did their own cooking and cleaning. You could eat off the floor. Blindness would have made them completely dependent. 'I sometimes think, if they had their wives and children, perhaps they would have had something to live for.' The twins, from the village of Putte, near the city of Mechelen, were told they would go blind from a genetically caused form of glaucoma and had other severe medical problems, their local doctor, David Dufour. The pair, who both worked as cobblers and could communicate with each other using a special sign language understood only by them and their close family, enlisted the support of Mr Dufour to be euthanised. But it took them almost two years to find a medical institution to carry out the procedure after they were turned by their local hospital. Mr Verbessem told the Daily Telegraph that the family had tried to talk them out of it, but were eventually persuaded by their arguments. Relied on each other: The twins, pictured here on Belgian television before they were named, had lived together their entire adult lives and could not communicate with the outside world . They died by lethal injection four . weeks ago, dressed in new shoes and suits, with Mr Verbessem and their . parents, Mary and Remy, by their sides at Brussels University Hospital . in Jette. Mr Verbessem said: 'Marc and Eddy waved again at us. ""Up in the sky,"" they said. ""Up in the sky,"" we replied. And then it was over.' Euthanasia is legal under Belgian law . if those making the decision can make their wishes clear and are . suffering unbearable pain, according to a doctor's judgement. The Belgian law differs from that of . Switzerland, famous for its Dignitas clinic, where only 'assisted . suicide' is permitted. This means patients must play an active role in . the administration of the drug that ends their lives. Brussels University Hospital: In Belgium, some . 1,133 cases of euthanasia - mostly for terminal cancer - were recorded . in 2011, about one per cent of all deaths in the country, according to . official figures . In Belgium, some 1,133 cases of . euthanasia - mostly for terminal cancer - were recorded in 2011, about . one percent of all deaths in the country, according to official figures. But this case was unusual as neither twin was suffering extreme physical pain or was terminally ill. Mr Dufour, the doctor who presided . over the euthanasia, told RTL television news that the twins had taken the . decision in 'full conscience'. He said they were 'very happy' and it had was a 'relief' to see the end of their suffering. 'They had a cup of coffee in the hall, it went well and a rich conversation,' Mr Dufour said. More to come? Belgium's ruling Socialists tabled a legal . amendment just days after the twins were killed which would allow the . euthanasia of children and Alzheimer's sufferers (picture posed by . models) 'Then the separation from their parents . and brother was very serene and beautiful. At the last there was a . little wave of their hands and then they were gone.' Belgium was the second country in the . world after the Netherlands to legalise euthanasia in 2002, but it . currently applies only to people over the age of 18. Other jurisdictions where it is permitted include Luxembourg and the U.S. state of Oregon. Just days after the twins were killed, . Belgium's ruling Socialists tabled a legal amendment which would allow . the euthanasia of children and Alzheimer's sufferers. The draft legislation calls for 'the . law to be extended to minors if they are capable of discernment or . affected by an incurable illness or suffering that we cannot alleviate.' The Dignitas building in Pfaeffikon near Zurich: Under Swiss law only 'assisted suicide' is permitted - which means that patients must take an active role in administering the drug that ends their lives . The proposed changes are likely to be . approved by other parties, although no date has yet been put forward for . a parliamentary debate. A bid to tighten legal controls on . assisted deaths in Switzerland and ban suicide tourism was recently . rejected by the country's parliament. Experts say the suicide tourism industry's clients come mainly from Britain, Germany, and France, but that numbers have been declining in recent years. Statistics from Dignitas show the . clinic based near Zurich has helped a total of 1,298 people commit . suicide between 1998 and 2011.","Marc and Eddy Verbessem, 45, died from lethal injection four weeks ago .

"Factors contributing to the state's status as the worst for working women were not limited to wage but included issues of economics, health and leadership in 2013, according to 27/7 Wall Street. 1. Utah . 2. Wyoming . 3. Idaho . 4. Mississippi . 5. North Dakota . 6. Montana . 7. South Dakota . 8. Indiana . 9. Alabama . 10. Kansas . The wild west is no place for working women, according to a survey that says Wyoming, Utah and Idaho are the worst states for females in the workplace. The wage gap is not the only challenge working women face today in America. 24/7 Wall Street recently ranked the 10 states that they say are the worst for working women. The list chronicles how working women in the US fare between the states in terms of the gender wage gap, the poverty rate among women, the percent of women in the state's legislature, and the infant mortality rate in each state. Utah was number one on the list making it the worst state for working women. Women in Utah made 70 percent of what men earned last year, nearly the largest pay gap in the country. On average, women make 79 cents for every dollar a male makes in the workforce, though this varies across the states. Women in the state were reportedly less likely to hold leadership roles and there is very little female presence in the state's legislature. Utah may have been the worst, but  seven of the 10 states: they are all west of the Mississippi River. Utah: Utah was listed as the worst state for working women. The state shows a substantial wage gap and very little female presence in state politics . The western states on the list  had a poverty rate for women of above 15 percent and all had an infant mortality rate of above 6 percent. Four of the seven western states on the list lacked family-friendly and female-friendly health policies in the workplace, according to 24/7 Wall Street. These states have gained the status as the worst for working women, but four of those seven states have among the highest percent of female presence in state legislature. This list is based on a 2013 report by The American Association of University Women . 1. New York: 86 cents per dollar . 2. Maryland: 85 cents per dollar . 3. Florida: 84 cents per dollar . 4.

Ariane Hegewisch, study director at the Institute for Women’s Policy Research, told 24/7 that women are not only discriminated against in pay, but also lack career opportunities that are available to men. The list was determined by looking into three major categories: leadership, economy, and health, according to 24/7. On the list, Wyoming had the biggest wage gap with women making only 69 cents for every dollar a man made. 24/7 found that, on average, working women in Wyoming earned $35,829 a year, which is slightly lower that the U.S. median of $37,791 as of 2012. Men, on the other hand, had among the highest yearly earnings nationwide making close to $52,000. Challenges: Ariane Hegewisch, study director at the Institute for Women’s Policy Research, said that wage discrepancies are not the only challenges working women in America face . Alabama and Kansas tied with the smallest wage gap on the list, working women in both states earn 79 cents for every male earned dollar. However, Alabama is not faring well in measures of health that impact woman, 24/7 reports. The life expectancy of Alabama women is 78.2 percent as of 2010, one of the lowest in the country. The state reportedly lacks family-friendly workplace health policies and has one of the highest infant mortality rates in the country with 9.2 deaths per 1,000 living births. While women reportedly earned 80 percent of a man's salary last year, the poverty rate among women in the U.S. is a factor contributing to states that are the worst for working women. Mississippi had the highest poverty rate on the list with 26.6 percent and Wyoming had the lowest with 12.1 percent. A 2012 report from the Kaiser Family Foundation reported that women are more likely than men to be poor. The 2013 report by the Center for American Progress 'The State of Women in America' reports that women, as a whole, made great advancements in 2012 with a record number of women running for office and women making great progress in issues of health in economics. However, that is women in America as a whole, the state's on the list contrast greatly in each state legislature's female presence. The highest percent of women in state legislature on the list is Montana with more than 27 percent of the state's political leaders being women. Alabama had the lowest percent on the list with only 14.3 percent. The states had noticeable contrasting statistics, however, many of them had one thing in common: measures of health. Idaho, North Dakota, Montana, and South Dakota all lacked some aspect of family-friendly or female-friendly healthcare, 24/7 reports. Half: Today, women make up almost half of the United State's workforce, a great improvement from 1969 when women made up only one-third of it . Inequalities: In recent years, women have made great advancements and have even stepped up to lead the country, but substantial inequalities remain . Nearly 16 percent of women in Montana didn't have healthcare last year, and 24/7 reports that it has among the nation's worst access to health services. Working women in South Dakota reportedly cannot take paid time off to tend to their own health or pregnancy and North Dakota doesn't require employers to offer paid maternity leave to employees. Both Idaho and South Dakota officials have decided not to expand Medicaid benefits allowed under the Affordable Care Act. Issues contributing to these state's status as being the worst for working women include more than just wage. Other factors contribute to the status of working women in the states. Today, women make up almost half of the United State's workforce, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, a great improvement from 1969 when women made up only one-third of it. And, in recent years, women have made great advancements and have even stepped up to lead the country, the Center for American Progress reports. However, substantial inequalities remain. There is still more work to be done. Not only on a national level, but on a state level as well.","24/7 Wall Street recently released the 10 states they found to be the worst for working women .

"Thousands of families whose homes were damaged in the storms that battered Britain in January have yet to receive insurance payouts, with many still in temporary accommodation. In February, Prime Minister David Cameron put insurers on notice that they needed to ‘pay up the money fast’. Yet 7,480 households – 40 per cent of those who made claims – are still waiting for compensation, according to Association of British Insurers (ABI) figures. These also show that 2,600 will still be waiting at Christmas. On the Somerset Levels, an estimated 100 families are still in temporary accommodation – often campers and caravans. The village of Moorland on the Somerset Levels was flooded earlier this year and an estimated 100 families are still in temporary accommodation . Angela Bidmead, 64, and Den Cox, 67, have just started sleeping back at their house but still have to cook and wash in a caravan. Miss Bidmead said: ‘It has been horrendous. For ages I woke each morning crying.’ Mother-of-two Bryony Sadler, 39, hopes to return to her Victorian rectory in the Levels next month. ‘There are so many undecided issues and nobody will take a decision,’ she said. ‘Mr Cameron may have told insurers to pay up fast but obviously they weren’t listening.’ Marines help to place sandbags around a farm in the cut off village of Moorland, Somerset. Gillie Bolton, 66, and her husband Jim Wanamaker, 69, have had to move temporary homes three times since being evacuated from their bungalow in Windsor. She said: ‘We had refurbished the whole house before the floods. We are resilient people but this has almost destroyed us. My husband is suffering from cancer and we’re both on anti-depressants.’ In February, Prime Minister David Cameron put insurers on notice that they needed to ‘pay up the money fast’. Yet 7,480 households – 40 per cent of those who made claims – are still waiting for compensation . Windsor MP Adam Afriyie said: ‘Insurance companies must settle claims quickly.’ The ABI admits it does not know the exact number living in temporary accommodation. Insurers say not all outstanding claims are disputed and many involve residents who have already returned home. They believe 85 per cent of the 18,700 claims submitted will be settled by the New Year.","7,480 households – 40% of claimaints – still waiting for compensation .

"Even her greatest fans would acknowledge that Jo Brand is less than svelte – and the comedienne has long ridiculed her own physique and appetite for food in such books as her autobiography Look Back In Hunger and the TV series Jo Brand Through The Cakehole. So the notion of the star who once dubbed herself ‘the Sea Monster’ managing to squeeze her way through a dog flap sounds a rather fanciful tale. Would I Lie To You? Jo Brand appeared on the popular BBC One comedy show on Friday night . Yet this is exactly how she once broke into the home of an ex-boyfriend to steal all his underpants as revenge for him cheating on her. Recalling that she was ‘about 18-ish’ at the time, Brand said: ‘I was going out with this bloke who was a millionaire. ‘We went to a party next door to his house. He ended up snogging someone else at this party – a woman with blonde hair, I can’t remember her name – so I was quite cross,’ adding that she ‘just wanted to do something’ to make her jealousy clear. She joked that the dog flap was designed for a St Bernard then added: ‘He had a fat Scottie dog. I was thin at the time. I didn’t walk straight through – I wiggled through it.’ The 57-year-old said she searched the man’s bedroom for both washed and unwashed pants, as she wanted to do something ‘he would think was a bit weird’, while leaving him guessing over who was to blame. Brand’s confession came during her appearance on the BBC One comedy quiz Would I Lie To You?, a panel game in which contestants have to decide whether the stories told by other celebrities are true or false. Flap: At the time of the event Jo Brand's boyfriend 'had a fat Scottie dog. I was thin at the time' She had to explain her link to a mystery guest called Andy. ‘He once helped me break into an ex-boyfriend’s house through the dog flap so I could steal all his pants,’ she declared, leaving it up to the opposing team to decide whether or not to believe her. ‘Andy’s part in it was that he helped push me through the garden side and he kept watch in case the neighbours noticed. ‘We went through the bedroom, got all his pants out of the drawer and all his pants out of the washing basket [and] threw them out into the garden. We went and chucked them in a bin and then went to the pub or something. A bit of me wanted to do something that he would think was a bit weird and possibly not know it was me...’ She did not name the boyfriend and said she never saw him again. At the time, in the 1970s, she was living in Hastings, East Sussex, working in the civil service and studying part-time at nearby Bexhill College. In interviews over the years she has described her teenage life as ‘the nightmare adolescent business’ and admitted she was ‘invited’ to leave home at 16 by her parents. Lee Mack (right, with fellow Would I Lie To You? regulars David Mitchell, left, and Rob Brydon, centre) said: ‘I’ve known Jo for some years and I can confirm she is bitter and twisted’ This followed an ultimatum from her civil engineer father Ron to stop seeing her first serious boyfriend. In a newspaper interview 18 years ago, Brand’s mother Joyce recalled the moment. She said: ‘He was full of middle-class airs, with a very cavalier view of the world. She could have chosen almost anyone else and I could have coped better. He was 18, she was 16. The battleground was what time she could come home in the evening. ‘We waited up for her and he came in, too. It was after midnight. ‘When we said it was too late he was very disdainful. It made you feel you weren’t good enough. I was very angry.’ It is unclear whether the boyfriend later became the millionaire pants-snatch victim although due to his age it seems unlikely. Even her greatest fans would acknowledge that comedienne Jo Brand is less than svelte . The family row soon passed and Mrs Brand told how she felt ‘proud and protective’ of her daughter. During Friday’s show, rival panellist Lee Mack led the questioning of Brand about her millionaire lover. He concluded: ‘So you don’t know to this day whether he ... well, he knows now.’ She replied: ‘Hopefully he’s dead so he doesn’t.’ Mack retorted: ‘As long as you’ve got over it then, Jo.’ He suspected she was telling the truth, insisting: ‘I’ve known Jo for some years and I can confirm she is bitter and twisted.’ However he bowed to the votes of his team-mates who were both convinced she was lying. Brand, who lives in south London with her husband and two daughters, was unavailable for comment. Her manager said: ‘Jo is away for half-term.’","Brand, 57, told the tale on the BBC One comedy show Would I Lie To You?

"A Utah police officer who killed his family and then himself in January had drugged and raped his wife while filming it five times in the past two years, a disturbing seven-month investigation into the slayings has revealed. Joshua Boren used his Linden Police Department-issued handgun to shoot and kill his British wife, Kelly, their two children and his mother-in-law, also from the UK. He arranged the bodies of Hayley, 5, Jaden, 7, and their mom on the couple's bed and then shot himself dead next to them. According to Spanish Fork Police investigation, released this week, the couple had exchanged several heated text messages the day before the murder-suicide, with both seemingly agreeing their 8-year marriage was over. Kelly, from Northhampton, had moved to the U.S. where the children were at school, and her mother, Maire King, joined them. Scroll down for video . Shortly before her death, Kelly Boren told her husband she would take the kids, prompting Joshua Boren to reply by text: 'Don't involve the kids, they are innocent' 'You (expletive) drugged and raped me,' Kelly Boren texted, followed by four more texts with only the word 'raped,' according to the report, obtained by the Deseret News. 'I hate my life because (of) you,' she texted. 'You killed a part of me.' Investigators learned of the rapes, the latest of which was apparently in late 2013, through friends of the couple and Boren's therapist, who he's been seeing for sex addiction since the fall. In a journal, which his therapist asked him to write, he listed his weaknesses, stating: 'I have a sex addiction,' 'I fantasize regularly about people I see,' 'I've always hated sex offenders and their behaviors,' and 'I fantasize about drugging and having sex with Kelly and other women regularly.' His wife told the therapist that she hadn't reported the rape because she didn't want to ruin her husband's law enforcement career. She only discovered what had happened to her when she found the tapes in 2013, said Spanish Fork Police Lt. Matt Johnson. New police documents show officer Joshua Boren and his wife exchanged heated texts the night and morning before he killed her, the rest of his immediate family, then himself . Rapes: Kelly, pictured, only discovered what had happened to her when she found the tapes of the rapes in 2013, said Spanish Fork Police Lt. Matt Johnson . However, detectives noted in the . conclusion of their report that 'Word was starting to get out' about . Josh drugging and raping Kelly, and that he may have felt like he was . about to be reported, which would have resulted in loss of his job and . prison time. The . investigation also revealed Boren was allegedly sexually abused as a boy and according to the report . harbored a deep hatred for his mother because she didn't protect him. The . Deseret News reports that his father committed suicide when he was . five, after which time his mom allegedly began seeing numerous men, one of whom . molested him. His . therapist told police Boren spent a significant amount of time trying to . get over his hatred of his mother and described him as a '3-year-old . boy stuck in a big man's body.' The . report states that shortly before Boren ended his final shift for the . police department, he Googled the terms 'America's most brutal serial . killers' and 'narcissism.' Just before 6 p.m. on January 16, Boren sent his last text message. It was to his mother, and it read: 'I hope you are having a good day. Have a long and healthy life.' Josh and Kelly Boren had already been separated for some time when the slayings took place. The night before she was killed, Kelly Boren brought up the alleged sexual assault again, texting the word 'rape' to her husband four times . Boren shot his mother-in-law Marie King, 55, and his two children Haley, 5, and Joshua, 7, before finally turning the gun on himself . The night before she was killed, Kelly . Boren brought up the alleged sexual assault again, texting the word . 'raped' to her husband four times, the documents show. She wrote in another text: 'I don't want to live in fear and hate and anger.' The . next morning, Kelly Boren told her husband she would take the kids, . prompting Joshua Boren to reply by text: 'Don't involve the kids, they . are innocent.' 'Josh was a very troubled individual that felt like he was about to lose his wife and children,' police wrote in the report. Boren had worked for the Lindon Police Department for only three months when the murder-suicide occurred. Before that, he was a Utah County sheriff's deputy for seven years, Johnson said. He used the service weapon he was . given for his duties as a Lindon police officer when he killed his . family members and himself, authorities said. Toxicology reports from the autopsy show he had no drugs or alcohol in his system. Tearful relatives pay respects to 'amazing, wonderful' family killed by police officer dad in quadruple murder suicide including victims . Kelly Boren, her children, Jaden and Haley, and her mother, Marie King . Police said the state medical examiner confirmed what investigators believed: Joshua Boren shot his wife, 32-year-old Kelly Boren; his 55-year-old mother-in-law, Marie King; and his two children, 7-year-old Joshua 'Jaden' and 5-year-old Haley, before killing himself. The five of them had just returned from a Christmas break in Disneyworld, Florida. All five bodies were discovered in bedrooms after Lieutenant Boren, 34, failed to turn up for a night shift. The shooting happened at the family's home in Spanish Fork, a city of about 37,000 located 50 miles south of Salt Lake City. The events stunned the community, as well as friends and family, said Johnson, who added investigators didn't find anybody who suspected Joshua Boren was capable of such an act. Though Joshua Boren wasn't living at the house, friends and family said he still came every morning to get the kids ready for school and preschool, Johnson said. He also picked them up every afternoon. 'He was praised as being an excellent father,' Johnson said.","Report shows Joshua Boren and his wife Kelly Boren exchanged heated texts the night and morning before he killed her, their kids and her mom .

"Passport controls could be required at Scotland's border with England if it becomes independent in order to comply with EU law, Britain's Minister for Europe has warned. A separate Scotland would need to negotiate its own opt-out from the Schengen Agreement, which allows for free travel between 25 EU states, according to David Lidington. The agreement could pose 'a clear problem' should Scotland gain independence from England, he said. 'Clear problem': David Lidington, Britain's Minister for Europe, said the Schengen Agreement would create a challenge for Scotland's border control if they gain independence . Britain's decision to opt out of the Schengen Agreement means that other EU citizens are still subject to passport checks on our borders because is outside the European free travel area. However, if Scotland gains independence it will - as an EU member state - automatically be part of the Agreement and will have to negotiate its own withdrawal which must be approved by every other member state, it was reported. If it doesn't, passport controls would need to be set up at the border because Schengen bans free European travel between those who are part of the Agreement, and those who are not. Mr Lindington said - during a visit to the Scottish Parliament in Edinburgh - that there were no guarantees Scotland could choose to withdraw from the agreement. Opt-out: Britain's withdrawal from the Agreement means it maintains a tighter control of its borders . He said opt-outs from the . single currency and free travel area 'require not just a bilateral . agreement between the UK and an independent Scotland, it would require . the agreement of all of the other member states as well'. He . told the Telegraph: 'The fact the UK has an opt-out from Schengen means that we are . able to maintain the border controls that you don't often have on the . borders between Schengen countries.' Previously, the European Commission's president, Jose Manuel Barroso, warned that no more countries would be able to opt-out of the single currency. A spokesman for Alex Salmond - the Scottish National Party leader - said that the 'scaremongering' stories were demonstrably untrue, adding: 'They are insulting to Scotland, and the only effect they are having is to boost support for independence.'","Scotland will need to negotiate its own opt-out of agreement allowing free travel between EU countries .

"Border guards have been banned from asking EU nationals how long they intend to stay in the UK or even what they plan to do here. The Brussels move, confirmed by the Home Office, prompted incredulity among MPs, who called for Britain to regain control of its borders. EU officials claim asking new arrivals even basic questions would breach free movement rules. The diktat's existence, revealed last night in a report by MPs, means the Home Office is powerless to count net migration to Britain accurately. A Brussels diktat that bans border guards from asking EU nationals how long they intend to stay in the UK has prompted incredulity among MPs . Instead, ministers must continue to rely on a voluntary survey – the one that, as the Mail revealed earlier this month, underestimated the number of new arrivals from Eastern Europe by 350,000. The EU rule is another blow for the £500million e-borders programme unveiled in 2003 to check the details of passengers arriving and leaving the UK and to screen them for security purposes. The scheme has been dogged by IT problems and is still not working fully. MPs on the Public Administration Committee had said that e-borders – when complete – should be used by the Government to produce accurate figures on net migration. But yesterday the Home Office said this would not be possible because visitors from the EU cannot be asked how long they plan to stay. Only those who intend to live here for more than a year are officially classed as immigrants. As a result, the e-borders data would not be complete. In a letter to MPs, the Home Office said asking EU migrants detailed questions 'would be subject to challenge as disproportionate'. Tory MP Dominic Raab said: 'It's bad enough that EU law has stripped Britain of proper border controls' It continued: 'It should be noted that EU free movement legislation supported by historical European Court judgments prevent Border Force Officers from routinely asking additional questions... beyond those necessary to establish nationality and identity.' Last night Tory MP Dominic Raab said: 'It's bad enough that EU law has stripped Britain of proper border controls. 'But it adds insult to injury that, having invested heavily in a system that would enable the authorities to keep track of who is coming and going, Brussels has now banned us from using it.' The fiasco leaves Britain reliant on . the International Passenger Survey, which is based on voluntary . interviews with migrants and was described by MPs as 'not fit for . purpose'. Earlier this . month, the Daily Mail revealed that the IPS had failed to count 350,000 . Eastern European immigrants because inspectors were at the wrong . airports, with only a handful at places such as Luton and Stansted, . where hundreds of thousands of migrants were arriving. The EU rule is another blow for the . £500million e-borders programme unveiled in 2003 to check the details of . passengers arriving and leaving the UK . In addition, immigrants on many ferry routes were rarely or never checked and tens of thousands of children were missed. Failures meant that between 2001 and 2011, net migration – the population change after both immigration and emigration are counted – was underestimated by 346,000, equivalent to a city the size of Bradford. Nearly a quarter of a million went uncounted between 2005 and 2008. The Home Office said improvements had been made to the IPS, adding: 'We do not agree with the conclusion that the International Passenger Survey is inadequate for measuring, managing and understanding levels of migration.' Officials said the Office for National . Statistics had made a number of improvements and the estimates 'are at . the national level as reliable and accurate as is possible to achieve . under current survey design and levels of funding'. A Home Office spokesperson said: 'The . Home Office agrees with both the ONS and UK Statistics Authority that . the International Passenger Survey is the best measure of net migration. Data from the Border Systems Programme is supplied to the ONS to help . improve estimates of net migration. Keith Vaz, chairman of the Home Affairs select committee, said the public have been 'badly let down' The spokesman added: 'Under . this government all passengers are now subject to checks, the majority . before they even arrive in the UK in addition to at the border. 'While . EU freedom of movement legislation prevents Border Force from routinely . asking EU citizens questions in support of migration statistics, Border . Force officers do routinely examine passengers seeking entry to the UK. 'Passengers can be . detained for further questioning, including those from within the EU, if . the officer suspects the individual is presenting a false identity or . nationality or they have reason to suspect the individual is involved in . crime, terrorism or immigration offences.' But Keith Vaz, chairman of the Home Affairs select committee, said: 'I am deeply concerned by the Home Office's response. 'The e-borders programme has cost the taxpayer hundreds of millions of pounds, taken more than a decade and now we know that a key original objective will never be achieved. The public have been badly let down.'","Home Office is powerless to count net migration accurately .

"A penniless Miami mom desperate to feed her hungry family was nearly arrested while trying to steal $300 worth of groceries, but the responding officer decided to help her instead. Officer Vicki Thomas arrived on the scene last month, and when Jessica Robles admitted the food was for her starving family, Thomas sent her home with a misdemeanor citation and $100 worth of groceries. Since news of Thomas's act of kindness has spread, good will offers of money, food, and even a job have poured into the Robles household. Kindness of strangers: Miami-Dade police officer Vicki Thomas chose to buy a penniless mom some of the groceries she was caught trying to steal instead of arresting her . So grateful: Jessica Robles made the desperate decision to steal food for her hungry family. But getting caught has helped her turn over a new leaf . 'I made the decision to buy her some groceries because arresting her wasn't going to solve the problem with her children being hungry,' Thomas, a 23-year veteran on the force, told WSVN. Robles' 12-year-old daughter Anais shared the family's dire situation with the Miami FOX affiliate. '[It's] not fun,' she said tearfully, 'to see my brother in the dirt hungry, asking for food, and we have to tell him, ""There is nothing here.""'

'That $100 to me was worth it' 'To see them go through the bags when we brought them in, it was like Christmas,' she said. 'That $100 to me was worth it.' Thomas left them with one request. 'The only thing I asked of her is, when she gets on her feet, that she help someone else out,' Thomas said. 'And she said she would.' But Robles' good fortune didn't end there. After news of her situation and of Thomas’s good deed spread, offers of money and food began to come in. Robles made a return trip to a grocery store, but this time it was with some members of the community who raised $700 for her to spend at the store. And the mother of four even got to keep what was left over. While Robles certainly needs the cash, she’ll now be making her own money with a new job she landed at a local call center after the owner heard her story. John Challenor of phonedoctor.com invited Robles in to see her resume and hired her as a customer service rep on the spot. 'There's no words,' Robles told Challenor through tears, 'how grateful I am that you took your time and helped somebody out. Especially somebody like me.' Generosity: Since news of her story has spread, Robles was given $700 more to buy groceries with from concerned community members and got to keep the leftover cash .

"Nailed it: Cobbler, Charles Powell, 69, saw off the threat from Tesco, who withdrew their plan to open a new shoe repair outlet nearby . These days independent shops are all too often struggling and the future looked especially bleak for cobbler Charles Powell. With Tesco planning to open a shoe repair outlet in the supermarket car park opposite, he feared it was the death knell for the little shop that has been his pride and joy, not to mention his livelihood, for 30 years. So the 69-year-old shopkeeper from the small town of Cradley Heath in the Black Country wrote to the store chain’s chairman Sir Richard Broadbent to express his worries… and in a remarkable David versus Goliath victory, Tesco withdrew its planning application. Mr Powell, who was backed by a petition from 250 customers, said: ‘You can’t let these big businesses steamroller the smaller shops. ‘I am not against competition, but as a single trader I couldn’t have competed with a business on a car park supported by such a huge supermarket chain that could open from 8am to 7pm seven days a week. ‘Besides, there are plenty of empty shops in Cradley Heath high street.’ In what may seem as a surprisingly humane response from the world of big business, Tesco described the support he received from his customers as ‘heart-warming’ and even invited him to have coffee with the local supermarket’s manager. Mr Powell has run C&C Shoe Repairs since 1984. He refuses to retire because he enjoys his work so much. Like many high streets, Cradley Heath’s has been hit by competition from out-of-town shopping centres as well as online shopping. Mr Powell found out about the Timpson ‘pod’ offering shoe, phone and watch repairs, plus dry cleaning, photo ID, key cutting and engraving services, from a planning notice that was stuck on a lamppost near his shop. Timpson, which opened its 1,000th shop in Britain in January, announced plans to open at least 150 branches during 2014. Despite objections from traders to the branch at Cradley Heath, planning officers recommended councillors approve the application, which was made by Tesco. They said they accepted there were empty shops in the high street but pointed out that the pod was very small and retailers were welcome in the town centre. Sole trader:  Mr Powell has owned C&C Shoe Repairs for 30 years . The application was due before Sandwell Council this week, but was ditched by Tesco last week. Liz Johnston, a Tesco customer services executive, wrote to Mr Powell saying she was sorry the proposal had caused him so much worry and telling him that she had contacted the local store and Tesco’s planning department ‘to see if we could have this decision overturned’. She added: ‘Given the overwhelming support you received from the residents of Cradley Heath, they have all agreed it would be wrong to open a Timpson’s in this store. ‘It was heart-warming to see the support you received from your customers. We realise how important your business is to them and are happy to support your continued presence in the high street.’ Mr Powell said: ‘I have done my little bit for my business and I appreciated Tesco’s decision. You have to help yourself sometimes.’ He added: ‘I want to thank customers and fellow traders for their tremendous support.’ Mr Powell has put the letter he received from Tesco in his shop window. A Tesco spokesman said: ‘We always try and do the right thing for the communities we serve.’","Charles Powell, of Cradley Heath, West Midlands, opened his shop, C&C Shoe Repairs, in 1984 and said it's his pride and joy .

"A new interactive map lets users nuke any location in the world with a nuclear bomb of their choosing. The Nukemap 3D uses Google Earth images to simulate the nuclear attack and bases the animations on how mushroom clouds have behaved using information from various nuclear tests since the 1940s. Users can select a location, choose their weapon and their viewing location, and see the bomb drop and the cloud develop. The altitude of the cloud, how far it spreads and the number of casualties is also shown. Click the map below to nuke a city . The Nukemap 3D uses Google Earth . images to simulate the nuclear attack and bases the animations on how . mushroom clouds have behaved during various tests since the 1940s. Users can select a location, choose . their weapon and their viewing location, and see the bomb drop and the . cloud develop real-time. The altitude of the cloud, how far it spreads . and the number of casualties is also shown. Casualty numbers are based on how many people live in that region and their various distances from ground zero. Nukemap 3D is the third in a series of nuclear bombing simulators . created by historian Alex Wellerstein from the American Institute of . Physics in Mayland. According to Wellerstein, the map was designed to provide a visual and accurate simulation of what would happen if a nuclear bomb was dropped on any city in the world. It was also created to give people a better understanding of how it would affect their hometowns or places they are familiar with. And the map can highlight the varying levels of nuclear bombs and their respective threat. Wellerstein said on his blog: 'We live in a world where nuclear weapons issues are on the front pages . of our newspapers on a regular basis, yet most people still have a very . bad sense of what an exploding nuclear weapon can actually do.' Casualty numbers quoted on Nukemap are based on how many people live in that region and their various distances from ground zero. This image shows the cloud from a 10 kiloton blast on Manhattan, as seen from New York harbour. The Nukemap 3D lets you change location, the size of the bomb and the viewing location . This population information was bought by the Centre for History of Physics at the American Institute of Physics. The behaviour of the clouds is based on equations by E. Royce . Fletcher, Ray W. Albright, Robert F.D. Perret, Mary E. Franklin, I. Gerald Bowen, and Clayton S. White, as well as U.S. Atomic Energy Commission Civil Effects Test Operations, . written in February 1953, and Samuel Glasstone and Philip J. Dolan's The Effects of . Nuclear Weapons, 1964 edition. The bombs Nukemap users can choose from include a North Korean bomb tested in October 2006 as well as the 'Little Boy' Hiroshima bomb and the 'Ivy King' - the largest known pure fission weapon ever tested. If a 20kt nuclear bomb was dropped on Oxford, pictured, the cloud altitude could reach 7,210m. It could cause 11,950 deaths and 42,750 injuries . Each bomb is shown with its relative yield in tonnes or kilotonnes, which determines the size and impact of the nuke. Wellerstein adds that all of the information used to create the Nukemap 3D is publicly available and doesn't provide any secret data. He defends the map against critics who claim the site could be used by terrorists by saying: ' If we get to the point where a terrorist group is asking, 'where should I set off my nuclear weapon that I have?' then we've already gone past the point of no return. There's no way to avert a catastrophe at that point.' Because the Nukemap 3D uses Google Earth images, users must have the Google Earth plug-in installed on their browser to use the map. Previous versions of the Nukemap use Google Maps but don't have the 3D animations of the Nukemap 3D. This map created by nuclear weapon historian Alex Wellerstein demonstrates the fallout caused by 2.3 megaton bomb dropped on Washington. It was modeled on the Soviet weapons held during the Cuban Missile Crisis of the 1960s .","The Nukemap 3D uses Google Earth images to simulate nuclear bombings .

"Faced with months of roadworks and a 14-mile diversion around a busy commuter route, most of us would simply resign ourselves to an earlier start to the working day. But businessman Mike Watts had different ideas. After experiencing the upheaval caused by a road closure in Somerset, he rented a nearby field – and became the first private individual to build a British toll road in more than a century. Mr Watts spent £150,000 building the unofficial road next to the A431, where a small section had been cordoned off after a landslip – leaving thousands with a 14-mile detour through country lanes. Scroll down for video . Mike Watts at the Kelston Toll Road - the first privately run toll road to be built since cars became a familiar sight on British roads more than 100 years ago . That'll . be £2 please, sir: A driver pays up to avoid a 10-mile detour on the A4 . although the local council do not approve of the road which cuts . through an unused field . The new . route, which has not yet received planning permission, opened on Friday . and bypasses the closed section of road. Now for a payment of £2 each . way, motorists can avoid driving on the hour-long diversion, and instead . travel 400 yards along freshly laid tarmac. Speaking . next to his road in Kelston, Somerset, 62-year-old Mr Watts said: ‘I . have had a 100 per cent positive response from the public on this. Too . many people are displaced by the road closure. ‘Their . daily lives have been so disrupted. I think people are very grateful . that we have taken the risk. It’s not easy to build your own toll road, . but we got there in the end.’ The A431 between Bristol and Bath was closed in February after a landslip caused cracks to appear in the road. Mike Watts's toll road will be open 24 hours a day, seven days a week, with toll operators there all the time . Businesses . in the area soon began to suffer – including the cafe and party . supplies shop Mr Watts runs with his 52-year-old wife Wendy in Bath. ‘It . used to just be a very quick drive for us to Bath, but we were having . to do a 14-mile detour which was taking up to an hour down tiny lanes . just not designed to take the traffic,’ Mr Watts explained. He . asked landowner John Dinham for permission to rent the field until . Christmas and hired three workmen to build the road in just ten days. His . bill came to £150,000, but Mr Watts believes the road will cost him a . further £150,000 in upkeep costs, including the salaries of two . 24-hour-a-day toll booth operators. However the father of four is confident he will recoup his investment before the council’s road opens in December. The Kelston toll road has been opened by local businessman Mike Watts, 62, who was fed up of an hour long detour caused by roadworks after just a few hundred yards of highway was cordoned off thanks to a landslip .

Christmas just to break even,’ he said, adding: ‘If we cover our costs . we’ll be very happy indeed.’ Mr Watts has now applied for retrospective permission for the 22ft-wide road. He . has also taken out public liability insurance and officers from Bath . and North East Somerset Council and the Health and Safety Executive have . inspected the site to make sure it is on stable ground.

The six teens include Brandon Peralta, 17, Tyler Joseph Normandin, 18. The other four – three 16-year-olds and one 15-year-old - haven’t been named because they’re juveniles. According to warrants, Peralta is accused of engaging in sexual battery ‘using force and/or coercion to accomplish the battery, the defendant knowing or having reason to know that the victim was mentally defective, mentally incapacitated or physically helpless.’ Investigators said the school resource officer at West-Oak High School received an anonymous tip that a student may have been sexually assaulted at the party on October 12 . Warrants said Normandin encouraged 'others to commit the felony act of criminal sexual conduct upon a 15 year old victim' Warrants said Normandin, ‘with the intent that another commit a crime, did entice, advise, invite, order or otherwise encourage others to commit the felony act of criminal sexual conduct upon a 15 year old victim while said victim was mentally incapacitated or physically helpless.’ According to investigators, two others have been charged with Criminal Sexual Conduct – third degree, one with Criminal Sexual Conduct with a minor – 2nd degree, and one with Criminal Sexual Conduct with a minor third degree, but that juvenile will be charged as an adult. The Oconee County Sheriff’s Office is continuing their investigation. 'The young lady who was assaulted, she did not deserve that to happen regardless of the circumstances. It’s a terrible situation,' said Public Information Officer Jimmy Watt.

"Britain continued to bask in gloriously sunny temperatures yesterday, as forecasters predicted that the long-overdue summery spell is set to continue throughout the weekend in the UK. After Tuesday's temperatures of almost 27C in parts of England set the standard for the hottest day of the year, the mercury rose again as thousands flocked to beaches, parks and gardens. The record for the warmest day of 2012 was again smashed in, of all places, Scotland, as residents in Aviemore, Invernesshire enjoyed a tropical heat of 26.9C.

Time out: Edinburgh University student Camille Kim, 22, has a meditative moment north of the border yesterday . The balmy temperatures in Scotland beat Tuesday's record in Solent, Hampshire by 0.2C, though forecaster anticipated that record could be eclipsed by sunny spells in other parts of England. South of the border, Thorney Island, near Solent, Hampshire, experienced highs of 25.3C by mid-afternoon on Wednesday, while Spadeadam in Cumbria also enjoyed the same temperature. Met Office experts said that, although some breezes were expected across Britain in days to come, the sunny weather was generally expected to hold out in weather which is 'very warm for the time of year'. The warmer-than-average temperatures saw the UK heat climb higher than several other European cities, including Rome, where the temperature yesterday was between 4 and 5C lower than many parts of the UK. Forecaster Helen Chivers said yesterday: 'It should stay sunny for the next four days. 'There will be subtle changes from day to day, and there may some more colder air tomorrow, but overall places will have plenty of sun throughout the weekend.

Taking it easy: The sun was so unexpected, some were caught unawares and still had their brollies out just in case . It follows weeks of weather so wet that officials have had to coin a new name for the strange situation whereby Britain found itself hit simultaneously by both floods and hosepipe bans. Environmental Stress due to Rainfall Deficit, or ‘ESRD’ for short, is the term being employed by the Environment Agency. The agency admits it is not exactly catchy but believes it best describes the situation in the 19 counties no longer in drought. And this is only the start of it. They plan to create ‘more sophisticated terminology’ to describe an array of dry conditions, and address concerns that the term drought is too ‘blunt’. The aim is to prevent a repeat of the situation this year where people were told that their areas were officially in drought despite the fact their homes were being flooded. In future, dry conditions could be divided into a number of sub-categories to describe the level of water shortage and who is affected. The drought was rained off for much of the South West and the Midlands ten days ago after more than double the average rainfall last month. It is still in force in the east of England, where hosepipes are banned. Heavy downpours saw 150 properties flooded, 75 flood warnings issued and more than 10,000 phone calls to a flood helpline.

"Lib Dem minister Norman Baker last night resigned from the Home Office, claiming working with Theresa May was like 'walking through mud'. The maverick and conspiracy theorist claimed he could no longer work with the Home Secretary after the Tories blocked his report on decriminalising drugs. But his decision to resign had been planned with Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg for months and timed to cause maximum damage to Mrs May, who is under pressure over her bungled handling of the government's child abuse inquiry. Mr Baker will be replaced at the Home Office by the International Development minister Lynne Featherstone, who has previously worked under Mrs May. Scroll down for video . Lib Dem Norman Baker, pictured today, after resiging from the Home Office with a swipe at Home Secretary Theresa May, who arrived in Downing Street for this morning's Cabinet meeting . Mr Baker used a newspaper interview to launch a stinging attack on Mrs May, accusing her of running the Home Office as a 'Conservative department in a Conservative government' and not part of the coalition. He accused her of being 'soft on drugs' for refusing to bow to his demands for reform of the law to decriminalise possession of drugs and target dealers. It suggested he had taken the decision to resign after last week's public row over his report into drug laws around the world, which was suppressed for several months by the Conservatives. However, Mr Baker struck a secret deal with Mr Clegg in August to resign from his post at the point which would cause maximum damage to Mrs May and her Conservative colleagues. The Home Secretary was forced to eat humble pie in the Commons yesterday as she explained why not one but two people she had appointed to chair the inquiry into historic child abuse had been forced to resign. She said sorry for the child sex abuse inquiry debacle and admitted the Government may have to look abroad for its third chairman. The Home Secretary insisted the resignation of Fiona Woolf last week would not derail the inquiry, which will meet for the first time a week tomorrow without a chair – four months after it was announced. Hours later, Mr Baker gave an interview in which he claimed Mrs May found it  'hard to accept' that he was the Lib Dem minister in her department, and he could no longer work with her. Mr Baker, 57, will remain as MP for Lewes, where he is defending a majority of 7,647. Mrs May brushed off the row and welcomed the return of Lib Dem Lynne Featherstone to the Home Office . Theresa May remains the top choice as the next Tory leader among party members, a new survey showed today. A quarter of members (24 per cent) surveyed by ConservativeHome back the Home Secretary, ahead of 22 per cent for Boris Johnson and Michael Gove on 11 per cent. However, Mrs May has slipped in the league table of Cabinet ministers' performance, down one place to sixth. It follows the ongoing problems with finding a chair for the child abuse inquiry and growing public unease about immigration. Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith is rated as the best performer, followed by Mr Gove, Chancellor George Osborne, Commons Leader William Hague and Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt. Tories retaliated, accusing him of behaving like a 'Liberal Democrat Home Secretary' despite being a middle-ranking minister. But Mr Baker told The Independent: 'They have looked upon it as a Conservative department in a Conservative government, whereas in my view it's a Coalition department in a Coalition government. 'That mindset has framed things, which means I have had to work very much harder to get things done even where they are what the Home Secretary agrees with and where it has been helpful for the Government and the department. 'There comes a point when you don't want to carry on walking through mud and you want to release yourself from that.' In his resignation letter to Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg, Mr Baker wrote: 'I regret that in the Home Office, the goodwill to work collegiately to take forward rational evidence-based policy has been in somewhat short supply.' Last night it was claimed Mr Clegg had tried to persuade him to stay. But Mr Baker had agreed in August the plan to stay in post until the opportunity presented itself to resign. Mr Clegg has repeatedly clashed with Mrs May, most recently when she claimed the Lib Dems were putting children at risk by blocking the Communications Data Bill, which would give police access to a person's full internet history and who they have contact with on social media websites. Mr Baker spent three years as a transport minister when the coalition was formed, and was a surprise choice for the Home Office when he was appointed in October last year. He wrote a book in 2007 claiming weapons inspector Dr David Kelly was murdered by an Iraqi hit squad, while the security services hushed it up. He has also claimed the death of former foreign secretary Robin Cook was suspicious. Mr Baker wrote a book claiming weapons inspector Dr David Kelly was murdered by an Iraqi hit squad, while the spies hushed it up, and has claimed the death of former foreign secretary Robin Cook was suspicious . Mr Baker said Mrs May had found it 'hard to accept' when he was given the role, but he added: 'To be fair to the Home Secretary, I think she takes the view she has to keep a tight leash on everything otherwise she wouldn't carry on as Home Secretary – she has been there four-and-a-half years. 'I think she is quite competent and professional, and I have a lot of respect for her professionally.' He added: 'I just think it's a pity that she took the mindset that the Lib Dems had to be put up with, and we were almost a cuckoo in the nest rather than part of government.' However, the Tories accused Mr Baker, a keen musician who is about to release his second album, of over-inflating his importance in one of the biggest government departments. Damian Green, a former Conservative immigration minister, said Mr Baker was like 'a guitarist who was only interested in his own solos while the rest of the band was trying to play a close harmony number'. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'Norman's problem was that he came in and announced, he gave an interview to his local paper, saying 'I am the Lib Dem Home Secretary', he regarded himself as being on a par with the Home Secretary and asked for papers from other ministers. 'He wanted to check what everyone else was doing. The world doesn't work like that. If you are a minister of state, in the end, you work to the secretary of state in that department.' Mr Baker sought to suggest the row over the drugs report was the final straw which forced his resignation. When asked about his public row with Mrs May over drugs policy, he said: 'The phrase 'soft on drugs' is used. What is soft on drugs? I think being soft on drugs is pretending there isn't a problem, and this is being sorted. 'If anyone is soft on drugs it's my Conservative colleagues, because they are the ones who allow the process to go on whereby drug dealers continue to make money and people continue to get fined and carry on taking drugs.' Mr Baker last week hailed a Home Office-commissioned report finding 'no obvious' link between tough laws and levels of illegal drug use. He said the report meant the genie was out of the bottle and was not going back in. He said: 'I think the days of robotic, mindless rhetoric are over, because the facts and the evidence will no longer allow that.' But he was slapped down my David Cameron, who said: 'I don't think anyone can read that report and say it definitely justifies this approach or that approach, but the evidence is what we're doing is working. 'I don't believe in decriminalising drugs that are illegal today. I'm a parent with three children; I don't want to send out a message that somehow taking these drugs is OK or safe.'","Baker claims working with Home Secretary is like 'walking through mud'

"David Cameron was today accused of 'sneaking off' from the NATO summit to go sightseeing in Chicago. US President Barack Obama told reporters last night that Mr Cameron slunk away from the talks to enjoy a relaxing stroll around the city. Mr Obama seemed proud that the Prime Minister wanted to take a closer look at his home city. But the intervention may be less than helpful for Mr Cameron, who has been forced to defend himself against claims that he is too fond of 'chillaxing' when he should be getting on with the business of government. Best pals: Barack Obama and David Cameron have spoken about their special relationship but the American president dropped the PM in it after telling journalists he had sneaked off to tour Chicago . Mr Obama revealed that the Prime Minister was 'sneaking off to do a little sightseeing before he heads home'. Aides insisted that Mr Cameron had not missed any of the summit and had around two hours to kill before his flight back to London on a commercial airliner. MailOnline understands Mr Cameron walked around the city centre before visiting the British consulate. According to a new book released this week, the Prime Minister does not find it difficult to switch off from the pressures of leading the country. Karaoke with friends, snooker, playing games on his iPad and three or four glasses of wine at Sunday lunch are just a few of the ways Mr Cameron spends his downtime. In the biography of the Prime Minister and his life at his country retreat Chequers, an ally is quoted  admitting: 'If there was an Olympic gold medal for ""chillaxing"", he would win it.' The cheers and the tears: Prime Minister David Cameron (fourth left) celebrates while watching Chelsea beat Bayern Munich in the Champions League final alongside a rather glum German Chancellor Angela Merkel (centre) Sporting gesture: Mr Cameron hugs Mrs Merkel after Chelsea won on a penalty shoot-out in Munich on Saturday . Mr Cameron has been forced to insist he is dedicated to the job but he has form for mixing summit business with pleasure. On a trip to Australia last year, Mr Cameron left the Commonwealth Heads of Government summit early to visit a vineyard. Mr Cameron has been stung by revelations about his leisure pursuits, and was forced to insist he was ‘completely dedicated’ to the job of Prime Minister. He even went on to say that he was as 'driven' as Thatcher, famous for her dedication and extremely long working hours. But sadly for him, his comments came hours after he was seen celebrating the dramatic finale to Chelsea’s Champions League victory over Bayern Munich. He has been widely lampooned for a picture showing him raising his arms aloft in celebration after Didier Drogba scored the winning penalty. While other world leaders – especially  Germany’s Angela Merkel – looked on with varying degrees of self-restraint, Mr Cameron threw his arms up in triumph and cheered wildly. He then gave a glum-faced Mrs Merkel a consolation hug as a bemused President Obama looked away. The PM was keen to stress that he did not watch Chelsea raise the trophy. ‘I was back to work before any cup was lifted,’ he said. But his friend and Britain's Chancellor George Osborne, however, was not so busy. He was pictured at the match in Munich smiling broadly as the team celebrated with the trophy in front of him. True blue: Chancellor George Osborne, centre, at the match in Germany, who also took some time off from government . Chillaxing: A new book claims Mr Cameron has a machine that fires tennis balls at him, which he has nicknamed 'the Clegger' after his victorious battle against the Deputy Prime Minister during the General Elections . Lap of luxury: Prime Minister's country retreat Chequers where he enjoys karaoke, snooker and three or four glasses of wine at Sunday lunch . The Prime Minister’s leisure habits have been seen by some as a sign of a lack of application. Some Tory MPs say he should spend more time sorting out the run of problems which have plagued the Government in recent months as opinion polls continue falling. Mr Cameron has been dubbed 'DVD Dave' with recent photographs taken inside his Downing Street flat showing the couple had 24, Desperate ­Housewives and Band of Brothers in their box set collection. He was also mocked this week for being pictured enjoying a swanky meal with his wife Samantha on one of their weekly 'date nights.' Storm brewing: The revelation that Prime Minister David Cameron spends long periods playing games on his iPad will not go down well with the unhappy electorate . Slicing through it: Critics claim Mr Cameron seems more bothered about slicing fruit in the platform game Fruit Ninja than dealing with Britain's increasing economic problems . Date night Dave: Mr Cameron was mocked this week for being pictured enjoying a swanky meal with his wife Samantha on one of their weekly 'date nights' The new book reveals that one the first Christmas since he moved into Downing Street, Mr Cameron's friends gave him a karaoke machine which is now at the house and he invites friends over for game of snooker. There is a machine that fires tennis balls, which he has nicknamed 'the Clegger' after his victorious battle against the Deputy Prime Minister in the 2010 General Elections. The book, Cameron: Practically a Conservative, serialised in The Times tells how Mr Cameron flicks through the papers early on a Sunday morning and spends his time at his computer. His afternoon consists of 'a crap film on telly, play with the children, cook, have three or four glasses of wine with lunch, have an afternoon nap, play tennis,' according to a friend quoted in the newspaper. Michael Gove, the Education Secretary and a family friend, told the authors: 'He is the model of how to have a clear divide between the world of work and then relaxation so you can clear your mind. There are very few people who have such a finely developed capacity to do that.' What's he up to? Pictured at his home, is Cameron checking up with government work, or playing games aimed at a younger audience? The book also reveals Mr Cameron can often be found surfing political betting websites. It also discloses his intense dislike of people clicking pens and checking phones during meetings and how his friend of 20 years and policy guru Steve Hilton believes that Mr Cameron had become too power hungry and has compromised his early ambitions for the demands of the coalition and Whitehall. Mr Cameron's aides have stated the idea of Mr Cameron spending a disproportionate amount of time relaxing are grossly unfair. But Mr Cameron was forced into frantic denials over bizarre claims that he spends a ‘crazy and scary’ amount of time playing computer games on his iPad. Running talks: Earlier in the day, Mr Cameron and Mr Obama staged a 35-minute 'treadmill summit' side by side at the gym . Debt crisis: The leaders of the G8 gathered at Camp David in Maryland to discuss, among other things, the crisis in the Eurozone . The Prime Minister, a fan of Apple’s trendy tablet computer, is said to be obsessed with the cult game Fruit Ninja, in which players swipe their fingers across a screen to slice through moving images of pieces of melon, orange and pineapple. Mr Cameron is thought to have taken up Fruit Ninja after completing the hit game Angry Birds. In a separate interview earlier this year the Prime Minister admitted that he found Angry Birds ‘addictive’, but denied it was taking up too much of his time. He said: ‘It is quite addictive, but I want to reassure you I don’t spend a huge amount of time on it. ‘Sometimes on these long flights, when you have done all your  work, you have had all your conversations and prepared all your speeches, you need something to relax with. ‘Sometimes I watch a bit of television, sometimes I play a bit of Angry Birds.’","Barack Obama told journalists the PM had taken two hours off to tour the president's home town .

"Uncontrollable shaking, terrifying nightmares and severe convulsions were among the most devastating symptoms suffered by the many First World War soldiers who suffered shell shock. By the end of the war, more than 80,000 men who had endured the horrors of battle were struggling  to return to normality. And here, disturbing footage compiled by British Pathé film archivists and released to MailOnline today, brings home the terrifying reality that for many the war never really ended. At the time, most shell shock victims . were treated harshly and with little sympathy as their symptoms were not . understood and they were seen as a sign of weakness. But at Newton Abbott's Seale Hayne in Devon, the approach was very different due to the revolutionary approach of a doctor called Arthur Hurst, an army major, who believed he could cure every shell shock victim.

Shell shock was a term used during the First World War to describe the psychological trauma suffered by men serving on the war's key battlefronts. The term was coined, in 1917, by a medical officer called Charles Myers - it was also known as 'war neurosis', 'combat stress' and Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. At first shell shock was thought to be caused by soldiers being exposed to exploding shells. But doctors couldn't find any physical damage to explain the symptoms. Medical staff started to realise that there were deeper causes. Doctors soon found that many men suffering the symptoms of shell shock without having even been in the front lines. Symptoms: . Hysteria and anxiety . Paralysis . Limping and muscle contractions . Blindness and deafness . Nightmares and insomnia . Heart palpitations . Depression . Dizziness and disorientation . Loss of appetite . In several medical establishments instead of receiving proper care, many victims endured more trauma with . treatments such as solitary confinement or electric shock therapy.

On the wards the men were encouraged to write and to produce a magazine with a gossip column called Ward Whispers. 'The main work was occupational therapy,' explained Arthur's son Christopher to the BBC. 'These solders who had been shell shocked had lost vital faculties like walking and speaking. 'They were given jobs to do and this was interspersed with intensive therapy sessions,' said Christopher.

"All you need is Low, apparently. And who can argue? Germany fans lined the streets of a sun-kissed Berlin in their tens of thousands to welcome home the World Cup champions ahead of the largest gathering the city has seen since 1990. Perhaps even a year previous when the wall came down. There they waited at the tip of Brandenburg Gate – the scene of seven parties over the past month to celebrate the hexagon of wins, and that draw against Ghana, over in Brazil – for one final send off. Some of the estimated half-a-million climbed traffic lights - one sat on the top of a Bratwurst truck. Anywhere would do. The take on the Beatles’ All You Need is Love was emblazoned on a homemade banner, supplemented with ‘we take a bow’. It captured the feelings of a united nation. This achievement – decimating all in sight – cannot be overestimated and is down in no small part to the meticulous planning and continued progression of their head coach, Joachim, over the last eight years. VIDEOS Scroll down to watch Germany's antics and dancing on stage as well as fan reaction on the open truck route around Berlin .

Jubilant Germans clap and reach to the sky as the plane carrying the winning squad flies over the fan park before touching down . Despite all that, it's unlike him to take any over-zealous adulation, with the 54-year-old destined to leave that to his players. The victorious 23-man squad were due to reach the fan park at 10am as pictures of them touching down at the city’s airport at exactly 9.08am were met with a chorus of cheers at the heart of the capital. The hordes had to entertain themselves for a little while longer after the side's flight from Rio di Janeiro was delayed by an hour after a luggage truck collided with the side of the aircraft - a fitting end to a chaotic tournament tenure for the Brazilian transport system. Not that it bothered the players, although whether they would've enjoyed the crowd's harmony of DJ Otzi's Hey Baby is highly questionable. They took the last part of the trip to the Brandenburg Gate, just over six miles on an open truck. Not bus, truck. The 'fan mile' had started filling up hours before the arrival, with some waiting overnight to get a place at the front. 'We're all excited to see what it will be like,' Bastian Schweinsteiger told ARD television. 'This time, thank God, we have the cup with us.' 'It will only sink in for us in the next few days.'

The messiah: A battered and bruised Schweinsteiger gees the crowds up even further draped in a Germany flag on the edge of the platform . The truck slalomed through the packed streets of the city as Gotze tweeted 'Wow, what's going on here ... AMAZING!' and Lukas Podolski posed for his now customary photos. For the record, Schweinsteiger and Kevin Grosskreutz were the unfortunate men involved this time. The Arsenal man finds himself on the end of a bit of stick for his social media prowess, but there is little doubt the forward who has 116 caps, 47 goals and has played for a decade for a decade is a key cog in this dressing room. 'The most amazing moment of my career. A super 6 weeks,' he enthused. His tweeting and thirst for pictures is clearly contagious. Team-mate Mesut Ozil followed suit as he gave his 7.4million Twitter followers an on-truck glimpse as to what the morning felt like, posting pictures captioned 'back in the country of the world champions'. And they kept the tens of thousands on tenterhooks upon arriving at the gate, with several players peeking out its interior to have a look at the masses below. It felt like the unveiling of a royal baby at Buckingham Palace. That was until Ein hoch auf uns by Andreas Bourani began to boom out along the mile. You wouldn't get that down Green Park. The chorus to that particular number is 'Here's to us, to this life, and this immortal moment'. A fitting tribute. When they finally made it on stage they were led by the bashful Low, who said: 'It was a long way to the title, and a tough one too, but we're delighted to be here with our fans. First, we wouldn't have got here without you. We are all world champions.' Raise your hands: Manuel Neuer (left) and Low enjoy the rapturous applause as they are cheered along the route . Delight: Ozil, Andre Schurrle and Mario Gotze celebrate on the top of the party truck . Per Mertesacker added: 'We're super proud of what we've achieved, especially after all we've gone through. And we're proud of these fans,' before Jerome Boateng whipped up the crowd. 'I can't hear you Berlin,' he queried. They duly obliged. That went up a notch once Toni Kroos took to the stage moments later, too. 'Miro Klose, Miro Klose, Miro Klose, you are the top man,' he improvised in song. Berlin erupted, as it's likely to do throughout the day. And the next. Probably the one after as well. Germany are world champions, and they know it.","Philipp Lahm, Thomas Muller and Bastian Schweinsteiger arrive at Tegel Airport .

"The mother lived a comfortable lifestyle and chose 'to line [her] pockets from the state' A nurse lied to obtain £92,000 in tax credits and lavished the money on luxury holidays, a holiday chalet and a pet pony for her daughter. Cheryl Henwood, 46, a mother-of-three, had claimed she was a single parent and that two of her children, who are all profoundly deaf, were receiving the highest level of disability living care allowance. But in reality she was living a very comfortable lifestyle with her police officer husband, Gary Henwood, and only one of her children was receiving the top rate DLA. She brazenly continued her lies for seven years before eventually being caught out by HM Revenue and Customs in March 2011. Judge Norman Wright jailed her for 12 months today at Liverpool Crown Court after investigations revealed that she had been living the high life with her ill-gotten gains . Henwood had been using the money to book family holidays to Florida Disney World, Dubai and a Disney cruise. Ironically, despite her claims to be single, she celebrated her wedding anniversary while in Dubai and had booked another Disney cruise shortly before HMRC fraud investigators discovered what she was up to. She also had a half share in a holiday chalet in a prime spot in Abersoch, North Wales, where chalets can be worth up to £185,000. She had bought a jet ski after she and her husband had completed the relevant qualifications. Henwood denied the charges but was convicted after a trial and had been due to be sentenced last month. The hearing was adjourned after the judge was told she could pay all the money back. Her barrister, Paul Becker, today revealed that she had paid £92,075 to HMRC the day after her last appearance and urged the judge to suspend any prison sentence. Comfortable: the close where Henwood lived comfortably with her husband and children . But after outlining the circumstances of the case Judge Norman Wright concluded: 'There has to be an immediate custodial sentence.' He accepted evidence that her and her husband had short times of separation 'but for the overwhelming majority of this period your husband was living with you in that household.' Henwood had been a district nurse in a position of responsibility and relatively high grade income and her husband was a serving police officer and earning a similarly reasonable income, he said. 'So this is not a case that very frequently comes before the courts of people on the breadline or just above trying to keep their head above the water and making false claims. 'You with your twin sources of income had a relatively comfortable background. The only conclusion that can be drawn is you lined your pockets from the state. 'When the authorities came to search your particular premises there outside was a BMW with a personalised plate and a jet ski. 'You are someone with a four bedroom home with ensuite bathroom to the main bedroom, walk in closet and a half-share in a holiday home on the Warren, Abersoch, said to be a very desirable place.' Exclusive: chalets in the Warren, Abersoch, which Henwood held a share in, can sell for up to of £185,000 . Houses on the same road as Henwood - Heythrop Drive, in Heswall, Wirral - are worth an average of £260,000. He said that there had been holidays to Disney Land, Disney cruises and Dubai and her 14-year-old daughter has a pony and goes show jumping. He said that Henwood, who has no previous convictions, is no longer in nursing but has set up her own business as a nurse prescriber in the cosmetic side of care. He accepted that she has long standing depressive illness and that all her children have severe disabilities but pointed out that her sons are 19 and 20 and in higher education. While it was said her children need her, her husband had been able to change his shift pattern when they were younger and he is available to provide them with care, said Judge Wright. In one financial year - 2004/2005 - she received £13,715 in tax credits when she was actually entitled to just £26. In another year, after again maintaining her circumstances had not changed, she should have received £535 but actually obtained £13,688, said Louise Brandon, prosecuting. 'She provided a thoroughly dishonest account of her situation in her application renewals and in telephone calls to the helpline.' While claiming to be separated from her husband they opened bank accounts together, went on holiday and were involved in various businesses together. 'Two laptops and a memory stick were seized after her arrest and they contained photographs of the family together enjoying holidays. Text messages spoke of purchasing a watch in Dubai and referred to her ‘hubby’,' said Miss Brandon. Henwood declined to answer questions after her arrest and denied she had been untruthful. Mr Becker said that Henwood’s new business as a nurse prescriber involves cosmetic procedures such as Botox, but if jailed her registration would lapse and she will not be able to renew it. He said that her original claim for tax credits was legitimate so it was not a case that was fraudulent from the outset. He explained that Henwood, who was a nurse in general practice for 20 years, had managed to raise the £92,075 she needs to repay by various means including her childrens’ savings, disposing her half share in the chalet and her oldest son has sold his car.","Cheryl Henwood defrauded taxpayers for seven years .

"Bedfordshire Deputy Commissioner Tafheen Sharif . A Deputy Police Commissioner was forced to quit after attempting to interfere with a murder plot trial, in a bid to stop embarrassing details emerging about a relative’s love life. Tafheen Sharif, 32, tried to use her position to get a judge to stop her cousin’s name being published as the relative gave evidence about the love triangle that led to her fiance being shot. Her unauthorised approach could have led to the whole case being abandoned at great cost, prompting police and court officials to step in. Miss Sharif, who is also a Labour councillor once named Young Councillor of the Year, was told her position was ‘untenable’ and she resigned over the summer. But the reason behind her resignation could not be revealed until the trial ended for legal reasons. Her boss Olly Martins, the Labour Police and Crime Commissioner for Bedfordshire, was under investigation by the police watchdog at the time, after he revealed secret details of a death in custody to his boyfriend. He only learned last week that he would not be charged over the unauthorised disclosure. Miss Sharif’s case will add to calls for the unpopular PCCs, introduced at great cost only two years ago, to be scrapped following a series of scandals. In the latest debacle, Miss Sharif almost derailed a Luton Crown Court trial in order to spare the blushes of her distant cousin Nazeem Dadd, who was at the centre of a love triangle that nearly led to a brutal murder. Miss Dadd, who like Miss Sharif lives in Luton, had been engaged to accountant Atif Ali, 28. She also had another suitor, Shahzad Mahroof, but her family did not approve of the match. So the jealous Mahroof hired hitman Bernard Pillay to kill Mr Ali in what the judge called a ‘brutal and callous act’. Mr Ali’s silver Audi was rammed off the road by Pillay in Luton in May 2013. When he got out of his car, Pillay blasted him in the leg with a sawn-off shotgun and although he survived after emergency surgery, he was left with life-changing injuries. A trial began in July this year but just before Miss Dadd was due in the witness box, Deputy PCC Miss Sharif contacted the court to ask the judge if her cousin could be granted anonymity to spare her embarrassment. Scroll down for video . Shahzad Mahroof (left) and Bernard Pillay were both sentenced to life in prison . Pillay blasted Mr Ali (pictured) in the leg with a sawn-off shotgun and although he survived after emergency surgery, he was left with life-changing injuries .

Although Miss Dadd’s evidence about her tangled relationships was heard, court officials were so worried that Miss Sharif’s approach might lead to the trial collapsing that they told police who in turn contacted the PCC’s office – leading to Miss Sharif’s forced resignation. Last month Mahroof, 28, and Pillay, 41, of Uxbridge, were found guilty of conspiracy to murder and sentenced to life with minimum terms of 15 and 17 years, respectively. The verdict means Miss Sharif’s intervention can now be made public. There was no comment last night from Miss Dadd, Mr Ali or Miss Sharif. But a close relation of Mr Ali said: ‘I don’t know why she became involved but most people would do the same. ‘It is unfair that Nazeem had her reputation damaged over something that was not her doing so I totally understand why someone would ask the judge about anonymity.’ At Miss Sharif’s home, several male relatives answered the door and said she was ‘out of the country’. On learning that it was an inquiry from the press, one young man sprinted across the street and tried to pull open the passenger door of Mail on Sunday photographer Craig Hibbert’s car. Failing, he went to the driver’s side and demanded Mr Hibbert get out. A reporter had his notebook snatched away and only recovered it after a struggle – during which one of the relatives ripped out a page of notes and stuffed them into his own mouth. Minutes later, six men unsuccessfully tried to stop Mr Hibbert’s car as he drove past. Mr Martins, Labour Police and Crime Commissioner for Bedfordshire said: ‘I was informed on July 30 by the police and representatives of the court of concerns about Ms Sharif’s conduct in relation to an ongoing trial for attempted murder. I met with her on July 31 and after discussions we concluded that her position was untenable. ‘For sub judice reasons it was not possible to comment on this matter, other than to confirm the resignation, while the trial and any subsequent sentencing were ongoing. ‘This issue has been referred to the appropriate authorities and it would therefore be inappropriate to make any further comment at this stage.’ Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Tafheen Sharif, 32, was Deputy Police Commissioner for Bedfordshire .

"A gaffe-prone crime tsar is under police investigation for allegedly driving without insurance, putting her under fresh pressure to resign. Ann Barnes’s Mercedes collided with another car and then ploughed into a tree, and The Mail on Sunday can reveal she is now being investigated by the force she holds to account, Kent Police. If she is found guilty of the insurance charge, she could be fined £300 and hit with six penalty points on her licence. Scroll down for video . Ann Barnes' insurance was allegedly expired when her soft-top Mercedes collided with another car and a tree . Mrs Barnes, 69, also faces a probe by the police watchdog for alleged misconduct in a public office, as she was on official business when the accident took place. The independent Police and Crime Commissioner, who is paid £85,000 a year, was last night facing renewed calls to step down following a series of debacles that have damaged the reputation of Kent Police and the troubled policy of elected crime tsars. Mrs Barnes’s latest troubles began on September 16 when her soft-top Mercedes crashed into another car and then a tree as she drove to a meeting in Dartford. She suffered only minor injuries and later tweeted: ‘Not feeling too bright today, but OK.’ Asked what had happened, she replied to one person: ‘Hit an unforgiving tree! Shaken, sore and bruised, but thankfully OK.’ After the accident, Mrs Barnes was given a ‘producer’ by local officers, which meant she had to report to a police station within seven days with both parts of her driving licence, her MoT certificate and valid insurance. This is common procedure after a road traffic accident. Sources allege that Mrs Barnes’s insurance had expired – making it a criminal offence for her to be driving. ‘She had to produce her documents and she didn’t have a valid insurance certificate,’ an insider said. Kent Police alerted the local scrutiny board, and Mrs Barnes’s own office referred the matter to the Independent Police Complaints Commission. Mrs Barnes has faced criticism of her £85,000-a-year role as Kent police commissioner, and was mocked for her van - called Ann Force 1 - which she drove around the county . Mrs Barnes also came under fire for hiring Paris Brown as her youth crime commissioner shortly after being elected for the job. Yhe 17-year-old stepped down after it emerged she had posted indecent remarks online . The latest fiasco comes amid growing calls for all 41 PCCs across England and Wales to be scrapped. Labour and the Lib Dems say they would abandon the experiment, which cost taxpayers £75million to set up. Even Home Secretary Theresa May admits some PCCs ‘have been responsible for mistakes and errors of judgement’ and backs the idea of voters being given the power to recall any who are failing. Kent Police said: ‘No one has been charged or cautioned in relation to the collision. Inquiries are ongoing.’ A spokesman for Mrs Barnes said: ‘We can confirm that the chair of the PCC was made aware of a referral from Kent Police following an investigation into a collision in Princes Road, Dartford. 'The matter was passed to the monitoring officer at the office of the PCC for further consideration. The monitoring officer has subsequently referred the matter to the Independent Police Complaints Commission.’","Mrs Barnes' soft-top Mercedes collided with another car and a tree .
