Rob Wright, 39, was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukaemia just three weeks before he was due to marry his wife Samantha in April. The father-of-five was put straight onto an aggressive course of chemotherapy and despite his weakened condition he celebrated his wedding in a small ceremony surrounded by close family and friends. Rob Wright and his wife Samantha were overjoyed by the birth of their twin sons Zack and Owen on July 24. Mr Wright had been diagnosed with acute myeloid leukaemia just four months before . Mr Wright, from Wallsend in North Tyneside, had first fallen ill on March 22. Doctors told him he had glandular fever and did some blood tests. But just a few days later he was in the Freeman Hospital in Newcastle having chemotherapy. 'Even when he was first diagnosed with leukaemia, all he was bothered about was getting married and asking if he would be able to go, recalled his widow Samantha, 26. Mr Wright, a firefighter, underwent four rounds of chemotherapy and both doctors and his family had been hopeful he would make a full recovery . 'He just wanted to get on with it, he just took whatever they threw at him. His phrase was ""let's just get on with it"". He was very brave throughout it all. 'He was really poorly and we had to cancel the evening do for the wedding.' During treatment Mr Wright underwent four rounds of chemotherapy. Both doctors and his family were hopeful he would make a full recovery. Thinking their luck was turning around, the couple were overjoyed by the birth of their twin sons Zack and Owen on July 24, just as Mr Wright's recovery seemed to be on course. But a routine MRI scan in October dealt the young family a devastating blow - the cancer had spread to his nervous system. Mrs Wright said: 'All the way through . from the first lot of chemotherapy, all the signs were good. They . thought it would be a standard transplant,so it was a massive shock for everybody.' Mr Wright and his wife Samantha had been set to marry this April and the wedding went ahead, despite his diagnosis. Right: with his son Dominic . Doctors . tried giving him radiotherapy but it did nothing to help and on October . 26 he returned home to spend his last days with his family, passing . away on October 29. Mrs Wright added her late husband 'loved nothing more than a challenge', including taking part in 'tough guy' competitions in Wolverhampton, pushing himself to the limit jumping through rings of fire and swimming in frozen lakes. She said: 'If you took all the words from the thesaurus for amazing it still wouldn't be enough to describe Rob. I will miss everything about him. 'He was very popular and full of fun, always laughing, cracking his jokes and very reliable. He would just do anything to help anybody.' Mr Wright has three children from his previous marriage, step-daughters Jordan, 20,  and Dayle, 17, and 12-year-old son Dominic.

Boris Johnson could boost support for the Tory party if he became leader by reaching out to rock fans of Nirvana, Jimi Hendrix and Muse, new research reveals. The London Mayor would be able to reach parts of the electorate which David Cameron cannot, securing backing for the Conservatives from 36 per cent of voters if he was in charge compared to only 30 per cent for the Prime Minister. While Mr Johnson won over fans of rock bands and comedians, Mr Cameron’s supporters were more likely to prefer Radio 4, Rugby Union and Anneka Rice. Appeal: The Tory party could win over more voters if Boris Johnson was leader because he has a wider appeal than David Cameron, according to new research . The six per cent of voters prepared to switch to the Tories if Mr Johnson was leader were more likely to use Facebook and Twitter, play video games and earn less than £25,000, according to the YouGov study. The data emerged using the polling firm's . new Opigram system, which gets respondents asks thousands of people to . list out everything they have an opinion on, like or dislike - movies, . books, celebrities, even food. Supporters of the Mayor of London were also more likely to be fans of surreal comedians like Eddie Izzard, Bill Bailey and Ross Noble, rock acts Muse, Green Day, Nirvana and Jimi Hendrix, and TV presenters Jeremy Paxman, Clive Anderson and Jeremy Clarkson. They were also likely to name Mediterranean classic aubergine parmigiana as a favourite dish. Fashion: The Mayor of London, pictured this week promoting British menswear, is able to win over younger voters . Rock: Mr Johnson is able to persuade rock fans of (left to right) Jimi Hendrix, Muse and Nirvana to vote Tory . The interests of Mr Cameron’s backers . were more traditional, preferring BBC Radio 4’s long-running comedy show . Just A Minute, and considering themselves admirers of Prince William, . Margaret Thatcher, Bill Gates, and tennis ace Andy Murray. They are also more likely to own their own homes, work full-time, own a car and work in the private sector. People . who like Mr Johnson describe themselves as ‘individualistic, . knowledgeable, disorganised’ but Cameron-likers see themselves as . ‘friendly, organised and hardworking’. Safe: Mr Cameron is viewed by voters as being too risk averse and 'comfortably establishment' by pollsters YouGov . Traditional: People who vote for the Tories lead by David Cameron also like Margaret Thatcher, the England Rugby Union team and TV presenter Anneka Rice . Stephan Shakespeare, YouGov’s chief executive, said: ‘True, much can be derived simply from knowing that Johnson has a greater appeal to younger voters. ‘But there's more to it: the Johnson attraction has something of the 'outsider' to it, whereas DC is all about the establishment.’ Writing on ConservativeHome he added: ‘It would be stupid to propose changing leaders, but Conservatives should be much more serious about understanding the added reach of Johnson, rather than just dismissing it with irritation. ‘To win the next election, Conservatives need to move outside their familiar comfort zones.’ He urged Mr Cameron to ‘take some risks’ in order to broaden his appeal. ‘Being Prime Ministerial doesn't have to mean being so comfortably establishment. ‘He needs to find some of that edginess, some of that ability to surprise, that he had when he first went on his quest to be leader and challenged the status quo,’ Mr Shakespeare added. Of the people willing to switch to back the Tories only if Mr Johnson was leader, 23 per cent voted Lib Dem in 2010 and only a quarter (24 per cent) consider themselves as Conservatives. One in five switchers is aged 18-24, compared to just one in ten of Mr Cameron’s supporters.","36% of people would vote Tory with Johnson in charge compared to 30% for David Cameron .

Eight days after the terror attack that claimed the life of Martin Richard, 8, his family still has an anxious wait for news on his little sister, Jane, who has lost a leg and remains in a critical condition, it has emerged today. Jane Richard, 7, is believed to have been standing on the marathon fence next to the big brother she idolized when Monday's blast took place. Father Bill and mother Denise - who also suffered head injuries - are having to remain strong for their youngest child, who is fighting 'multiple injuries' from the terror attack after losing a leg. Victim: Jane Richard, left, lost a leg in the terror attack and is still in a critical condition. Her brother Martin, right, was killed . Family torn apart: Jane Richard, bottom left, is . pictured in an undated photo with her family. Her brother Martin, . eight, was killed in the terror attacks and her mother, Denise, has undergone brain surgery . Watching: Martin Richard leans against a barrier - believed to be with his younger sister and father - just yards from where terror suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, 19, is thought to have left one of the two bombs . The couple buried their second oldest son in a private funeral today while their youngest remains hospitalised. 'The outpouring of love and support over the last week has been tremendous. This has been the most difficult week of our lives and we appreciate that our friends and family have given us space to grieve and heal,' they said in a statement. 'A private Funeral Mass was celebrated this morning with immediate family. We laid our son Martin to rest, and he is now at peace.  We plan to have a public memorial service in the coming weeks to allow friends and loved ones from our community to join us for a celebration of Martin’s life.' Jane is an enthusiastic Irish dancer having attended classes at the . Clifden Academy of Irish Dance in Milton since the age of three. Several Irish dance groups are now raising money to support her. 'She is just a beautiful little girl. We taught her since she was a baby, pointing her little toe,' Eileen . Dillon Dinn, owner of the Clifton Academy, told the Irish Voice. 'We are just in a state of shock and . disbelief. The Richard family is lovely. They went to the marathon as a . happy family, and then this happened. We don’t know what to say.' Jane loved to learn all the new moves . at the academy, according to her teacher, and was on the sidelines at . the recent Irish World Dance Championships in Boston dreaming that . someday she would get the chance to compete. 'She’s a beauty, always smiling,' said Dillon Dinn. 'Jane really lives to dance.' Her eldest brother Henry, . 12, and father Bill managed to escape from the bomb attack uninjured. Images from the scene appear to show . Bill, 42, a community organizer, holding his youngest children up on the railings as . Dzhokhar Tsarnaev plants his backpack bomb just behind them. It isn't clear whether any of the women in the photograph is the children's mother, school librarian Denise, 43, who sustained head injuries and had to undergo brain surgery following the attack. A spokesman for the family said he was unable to confirm the identities of those in the marathon image or provide an update for Jane's condition given she is under a privacy order. The Children's Hospital of Boston did not identify the seven-year-old girl they said was still in a critical condition. However, previous reports of the injured suggest that Jane Richard is the only one of 11 or so youngsters injured in the terror attacks that fits the sparse description. The family were watching elated runners cross the finish line on Monday. Bill is a former marathon runner himself so the young family liked to support other participants in the event, according to friends of the family. Victims: From left, Martin Richards, eight, Krystal Campbell, 29, and Lu Lingxi, 23, were the three people killed in the explosions which tore through spectators at the Boston Marathon last Monday . Neighbors said Jane looked up to her older brother and they both attended the Neighborhood House Charter School in Dorchester, where their mother served as the school librarian. Tracey Monroe, a bystander who came to Jane's aid in the moments after the blast, told WCVB.com: 'I saw her laying in the street. I held her head in my hands and I tried to rub her and comfort her. I asked what her name was and she said Jane. 'She was just a baby and so badly injured and scared. But she was so incredibly brave. I saw him [Martin] and at that point I knew he was gone. I'll never forget them - that little girl, she was so brave.' The bombs, described by experts as . makeshift anti-personnel devices, were made from pressure cookers packed . with shrapnel and ball bearings to cause the maximum injuries to those . caught in the blast. Boston firefighter James Plourde carried one of the more than 180 injured away from the scene . Triage care: Many emergency workers and volunteers used the old-fashioned method of tourniquets to help stop the bleeding from severely injured limbs . Scars will remain: At least 14 people lost all or part of a limb; three of them lost more than one . Tsarnaev, . whose older brother and suspected accomplice Tamerlan Tsarnaev was . killed in the manhunt to track the bombers down, has been charged with . using a weapon of mass destruction against persons or property. The . bombing killed three and injured more than 200, 48 of . whom were still in hospital today, three in a critical condition, . according to Reuters. A spokesman for the Boston Health Commission reported a sudden jump in the number of injured on Saturday . 264 are now being treated across 26 Boston hospitals, according to Reuters . The sudden jump from 180 came as dozens of people came forward with delayed minor health complaints, such as hearing issues of minor shrapnel wounds . 48 remain hospitalised . At least 14 people lost all or part of a limb and three of them lost more than one. But doctors say every one of the people injured in the Boston Marathon blasts who made it to a hospital alive now seem likely to survive. On Saturday estimates of the injured jumped from 180 to 264 as people with delayed health issues arrived at hospital. Nick Martin, a spokesman for the health commission, explained the sudden jump across 26 hospitals. 'One of the best examples is hearing issues,” Martin said. 'People might have first thought their hearing problems would be temporary.' Others sought delayed care for minor shrapnel wounds. The injured include several people who arrived with legs attached by just a little skin, a 3-year-old boy with a head wound and bleeding on the brain, and a little girl riddled with nails. Even a transit system police officer whose heart had stopped and was close to bleeding to death after a shoot-out with the suspects now appears headed for recovery.

News of the injured came as mourners attended a private funeral yesterday for Krystle Campbell, 29, at St Joseph's Church in Medford, Massachusetts. Miss Campbell, a steakhouse manager who attended the marathon every year, was caught in the first blast as she cheered on runners with a friend. Around a thousand members of the local chapter of the Teamsters Union took part in a vigil outside the church to head off threatened protests by the extremist Westboro Baptist Church, ABC News reported. And last night the family of Chinese graduate student Lu Lingzi, 23, attended a memorial service at Boston University for their daughter.

Hundreds of people, including state . Governor Deval Patrick, joined her father and her aunt who had travelled . from Shenyang, China, to repatriate their daughter's remains. 'She's . gone but our memories of her are very much alive,' said her father, Lu . Jun, who spoke in his native tongue and was followed by an English . interpreter.

The suspected bombers are also believed to have fatally shot a campus police officer at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology on Thursday night, before a gun battle with police and day-long manhunt that left most of the Boston area locked down. The city's residents and many of their well-wishers - including President Barack Obama at the White House - observed a moment of silence at 2:49 pm yesterday, a week to the minute that the bombs exploded .

Using these ancient drawings, historian Bert Hall has successfully managed to recreate one of these designs called the 'hand-washing automaton,' pictured . Al-Jazari was a Muslim polymath who lived during the Islamic Golden Age. He was a mechanical engineer and mathematician and designed various systems all powered by the flow and movement of water.

This automaton is a water-powered system that helps the user wash their hands. Once the water stops running, a cut-out figure presents the user with a towel. According to a video on the Smithsonian Channel, Hall enlisted the help of Chris Warrilow, a designer from Toronto, to create the device and demonstrated that it works effectively.

Professor Noel Sharkey from the University of Sheffield recreated a model, based on Al-Jazari’s design, which featured a programmable drum machine with pegs that moved into levers that operated the percussion. The drummer could be made to play different rhythms and patterns if the pegs were moved to different locations on the boat. Another was the elephant clock. According to the designs, a bucket of water was hidden inside a model elephant that took half an hour to fill. As the bucket sinks with the weight of the water, it pulls a string attached to a see-saw on top of the clock. A swinging see-saw swings releases a ball that drops into the mouth of a model snake, causing the snake to tip forward. The bucket is attached to the tail of the snake and as the snake swings, the bucket is removed from the water. It then slowly begins to fill up again over the course of another 30 minutes. When this happens, a figure hits a drum to indicate the hour or half-hour mark.

The tome vanished right after the New Year's Day ceremony at City Hall. De Blasio, the 109th New York Mayor, had laid his hand on it and taken an oath in front of former President Bill Clinton.

The bible is embossed with a picture of the White House and was given to President Roosevelt as a gift in 1933 at his first inauguration. In a sign of change, the . down-to-earth mayor had arrived for his own ceremony by subway, accompanied by his wife Chirlane McKray and their children Chiara and Dante. Speakers at the event, attended by an . array of guests, from former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and . Governor Andrew Cuomo, to stars including Cynthia Nixon and Steve . Buscemi, reiterated his campaign theme of justice and equality. Bill de Blasio used his first speech as New York mayor to thank the Clintons and Michael Bloomberg. To President Clinton: Over 20 years ago, when a conservative philosophy seemed dominant, you broke through – and told us to still believe in a place called Hope. To Hillary Clinton: Our groundbreaking commitment to nurturing our children and families manifested itself in a phrase that is now a part of our American culture – and something we believe in deeply in this city. It Takes A Village. To outgoing mayor Bloomberg: To say the least, you led our city through some extremely difficult times. And for that, we are all grateful ... We pledge today to continue that great progress you made in these critically important areas. In his first speech as Mayor of New York, de Blasio said: 'When I said I would take dead aim at the Tale of Two Cities, I meant it.' 'We see what binds all New Yorkers together ... the spark that ignites our unwavering resolve to do everything possible to ensure that every girl and boy ... that every child has the chance to succeed,' he added. The new mayor renewed his pledge to extending paid sick leave law, and tackling hospital closures, as well as providing affordable housing. Other key points of his campaign, including reforming the city's stop and frisk policy and providing better education, were raised too. 'We will not wait, we will do it now,' he said, as he talked of plans to ask the rich to pay a little more in taxes so the city can have universal pre-kindergarten. He laid out the framework for the reforms in which those earning between $500,000 and $1 million would see tax increase of $973 a year, with the extra revenue going directly to school programs. 'That’s less than three bucks a day – about the cost of a small soy latte at your local Starbucks,' he said, adding: 'Our common cause is to leave no New Yorker behind.

Clinton added that he endorsed de Blasio's fight against inequality, which was forefront of his mayoral campaign. 'I have to say I strongly endorse Bill de Blasio’s core campaign commitment to shared opportunities … and this inequality problem bedevils the entire country,' he told guests.

Local councils have spent more than £3million on social media since the start of the Government's austerity programme. Public spending has been cut by billions over the past three years, but many councils have been spending ever-increasing amounts on pushing messages through sites such as Facebook, Twitter and YouTube. Eight councils have spent more than £100,000 on tweeting and similar activities, with some employing members of staff solely to work on social media. Others spent thousands keeping up to date with what people are saying about them online - behaviour more often associated with paranoid regimes than local authorities. Pricey: Eight local councils have spent more than £100,000 on social media since 2010-11 . Critics say that councils are wasting their money on social media rather than delivering vital services or reducing the tax burden, but councillors claim they are actually saving money by shifting their communications online. MailOnline sent Freedom of Information requests to every unitary authority, borough and county council in the UK, asking how much money they have spent on social media since 2010-11. Dozens refused to answer, saying it is impossible to calculate how much of their employees’ time is spent updating official social media accounts. In total, 129 councils agreed to provide details of how much they have spent on social media, including staff costs, employee training, technology purchases and advertising. The figures show that they spent a total of £3,222,000 over the past three and a half years - a time when the Coalition Government has ordered councils to cut billions from their budgets. That works out at an average of around £25,000 for each council which responded. Top of the league: Newcastle City Council has spent more than any other authority on social media . The biggest spender of all was Newcastle City Council, where 13 members of staff spend at least part of their time operating social networking accounts - the council estimates that the total cost of social media since 2010-11 has been £147,480. A spokesman for the council said: 'We're proud of our commitment to social media and in terms of Twitter followers we are one of the most followed councils in the country. Newcastle Council's spending on social media since 2010-11 . 'Social media is a cost-effective and innovative way to reach people as they go about their daily lives. 'Our customer service staff use social media to receive and respond to a wide range of service requests from our customers every day. Many people in the city now prefer to contact us in this way.' Manchester City Council came second, with a total bill of £137,626 – including £16,000 on a piece of software which allows organisations to monitor what people are saying about them on social media. Councillor Nigel Murphy said: 'Social media is one of the main ways all modern organisations communicate and Manchester City Council is no different. The technology allows us to both listen to residents and efficiently communicate with them.' Six other councils admitted to having . spent over £100,000 – Belfast, Caerphilly, Cheshire East, Luton, Neath . Port Talbot and South Ayrshire. Communications: A grab from the Facebook page of Luton Borough Council, which has spent £113,250 on social media in the past three and a half years . Messages: A selection of tweets sent out this month by South Ayrshire Council, which has also spent more than £100,000 . 'Town halls should focus on keeping . council tax low, not wasting it on barely followed Twitter accounts,' Robert Oxley of the TaxPayers' Alliance told MailOnline. 'Too . often, local government bureaucrats worry too much about their presence . on social media, rather than focussing on delivering taxpayers value . for money. 'The best tweet a council could give out would be that they're cutting council tax and closing the account.' Cost of video equipment bought by Buckinghamshire Council to make YouTube clips . It is not possible to break down the . data on an annual basis, because of the different ways that councils . provided their figures, but representative examples suggest that . spending has been increasing rapidly. Sunderland . City Council spent less than £8,000 on social media staff in the whole . of 2010-11 - but from April to October last year, a period of just seven . months, the council spent almost £20,000, four times as much per month. While . most local government activity seems to be restricted to Twitter and . Facebook, others spentd thousands on video equipment to help them . produce professional YouTube clips - Buckinghamshire County Council . bought a camera, autocue and clip-on microphones for nearly £4,000. Many councils have sent staff to . attend social media training courses which can cost hundreds or even . thousands of pounds a time. For . example, Antrim Borough Council in Northern Ireland has paid for five . different courses, including one on 'engaging with citizens through . social media' and another on 'building a social media strategy'. And . for the council which governs Shetland, a similar course had an extra . cost - the islands are so remote from the British mainland that . officials had to spend £685 on flights in order to attend the training. Money-saver? Councils claim that using Facebook helps them cut costs on traditional forms of communication . Waste? Campaigners say councils would be better off shutting down their Twitter accounts . Many local authorities insisted that spending thousands on social media allowed them to save money by cutting down on activities such as sending press releases or letters to residents. A spokesman for the Local Government Association said: 'Councils use social media like every other private and public organisation. It is a vital and immediate way to communicate efficiently and effectively. 'For example, during severe weather bouts social media is relied upon by millions of residents wanting to know if vital services are running and transport networks are open. It is also often the only way that many people can access this information from their local authority. 'In addition to keeping residents informed, using new technology, including social media, has helped councils save millions of pounds. Communicating with residents is of huge importance, especially with councils having to make difficult decisions about how they pay for vital services. 'An average annual cost of £4,000 per council is good value considering the impact and reach that social media has.' How much Shetland Council spent on flying staff to social media training . Some councils' social media accounts appear to have a relatively small following - for example, Derby City Council has fewer than 10,000 Twitter followers and just 1,100 Facebook fans, despite a population of 250,000. The council has nonetheless spent more than £80,000 on social networking, working out at £7.50 for each online follower. Newry & Mourne, in Northern Ireland, has spent even more per person - £12.30 for every one of the 3,500 residents who are signed up to its Facebook and Twitter pages. Nearly 80 councils said that they either spend negligible amounts on social media or that they could not work out how much time employees spent on Facebook and Twitter - even though other local authorities, including big-spending Newcastle, were able to provide minute breakdowns of staff duties. Louis High, communications director at Redbridge Borough Council, said that social media has become so integrated into day-to-day work that it is impossible to separate Twitter and Facebook from more traditional media such as press releases. 'Social media is a major tool for us,' he said. 'But I'd find it completely impossible to put a figure against it.' A number of councils, including Edinburgh and Wigan, told MailOnline that they employ a member of staff whose main job is to update social media, but refused to reveal the worker's salary for fear of breaching data protection rules. Around two dozen councils simply failed to respond to the Freedom of Information request within the legally mandated 20-day limit. 'Every bit of the public sector needs to do their bit to pay off the inherited budget deficit, including local government which accounts for a quarter of all public spending,' said a spokesman for the Department for Communities and Local Government. 'Councils should focus on cutting waste and making sensible savings to protect frontline services and keep council tax down. 'If councils are making greater use of social media, then they should be able to drive down costs or remove costs completely. Cutting overall spending on communications is a good way of making sensible savings.'","Local authorities have spent £3.22million on social media since 2010-11 .

Memorial:  A French-German museum is expected to be built at the site of the Hartmannsweilerkopf battlefield (pictured) in French Alsace, where up to 30,000 Germans and Frenchmen died during the war . ‘Our look is at reconciliation, to have as many former enemies together as possible and to show that we have learned from our mistakes,’ said Norman Walter, a spokesman for the German Embassy in London. But Holfer Afflerbach, a German who is professor of central European history at Leeds University, said: ‘Both the UK and France have set aside vast funds for the commemoration and in good time, while Germany decided that their efforts would be reactive - so no wonder many feel that attitude is a bit stupid. ‘It is now clear that there will be a last minute arrangement which seems a bit inappropriate.’ Tribute: French President François Hollande will lay a foundation stone at the site of the battlefield in August next year . German historian Gerd Krumeich, who is advising the French government on the centenary, said the German government was ‘fundamentally uninterested’. The French were irritated with the ‘we want nothing to do with it’ attitude of the Germans, he said. He added: ‘It is a different experience for each country. There is no such thing as a common European mindset or sensitivity, Europe very much remains a rational idea.’ Over the course of 52 months, the war left 10 million dead and 20 million injured on battlefields from the North Sea coast to the deserts of the Middle East. Some six million Britons served in the Armed Forces during the war, and 800,000 of them never came home. That is more than twice the number of troops as perished in World War II. Historian Max Hastings has called for the British government not to bury Britain’s role in the war or to shy away from attributing blame to the Germans. ‘We are witnessing a depressingly familiar spectacle. Political correctness has taken hold. Those planning the commemoration feel almost embarrassed that we won the war, and are determined to say and do nothing that might upset Germany, our modern EU partner,’ he wrote in the Daily Mail. ‘I can think of no greater betrayal than for the British Government next year to pretend that they perished for nothing, because ignorant or frightened ministers flinch from upsetting today’s Germans, who have readily understandable reasons for wishing to ignore yet another of their nation’s least fortunate anniversaries.’ Norman Walter, press attaché at the German embassy in London, said in August ‘it would be easier’ for Britain to adopt a ‘less declamatory tone’ if it wants Germany to take part. ‘Our feeling is that issues about who was guilty and all that should be left more or less to historians and shouldn’t feature dominantly in politicians’ speeches. ‘The biggest single contribution to the start of the First World War was Germany, but others played a part. Whether it was a win or not, it wasn’t worth it.’ Germany would prefer the commemorations to focus on the dead, rather than the battles. Mr Walter also said the focus should be on the unity brought to the continent by the creation of the European Union. But he has denied that there is friction with Britain over the event planning.","Germany showing 'disinterest' in commemorating start of First World War .

The Oscar-winning actor called on lawmakers to tackle the ‘curable problem’ Jeremy Irons is leading a campaign to ban free plastic bags across Europe. The Oscar-winning actor called on lawmakers to tackle the ‘curable problem’ as the European Commission tabled proposals that could lead to a total ban by 2014. Among the measures being  considered are landfill bans, taxes and pay-as-you-throw schemes to encourage recycling. Promoting his documentary Trashed, which focuses on some of the world’s most polluted places, Irons said plastic waste litters the most remote parts of the globe thanks to our ‘throw-away’ culture. He gave ‘100 per cent’ backing to the Daily Mail’s Banish The Bags campaign, which calls on companies and politicians to reduce the number of plastic bags in our countryside and rivers. The actor said: ‘I would like to see a Government policy implemented of zero waste. In San Francisco, they have achieved 80 per cent recycling of all waste, so it is proven to be possible. ‘Worldwide commodity prices are rising . . . it seems obtuse to bury or burn those commodities that could be reused at far less cost than producing them anew.’ Irons, 64, said it would be much easier to cut the volume of plastic being produced, rather than finding ways to get rid of it. ‘I am an actor, not an environmentalist, but from what I have learned, I believe the construction of further incinerators in England is an unnecessary, costly and retro-gressive step, as well as being a danger to our collective health.’ Ban: Of the some eight billion plastic bags used in Britain in 2011, around two thirds ended up in landfill or being incinerated . Asked why he thought there were no . restrictions on disposable plastic bags in England, he said: ‘People are . not yet aware of the seriousness of the problem. I hope Trashed will . allow people an insight on this quite curable but global problem. It . will not be cured without the communal and political will to do so.’ Shoppers are currently charged for . plastic bags in Wales and Ireland, where usage has dropped by up to 96 . per cent. Scotland is also implementing plans to charge for the bags. Asked whether England should follow . suit, Irons said: ‘Of course we should . . . it is eminently possible to . change people’s habits. It makes financial and environmental sense.’ Despite a Coalition promise to tackle the issue, 330million extra bags . were handed out by shops in 2011. Most are used for just minutes, but . can harm wildlife for generations. The Daily Mail’s campaign, launched . in 2008, has won support from groups such as the Marine Conservation . Society and the National Trust. EU environment commissioner Janez Potocnik said that recycling could protect resources. He said: ‘Managing plastic waste is a major challenge in terms of . environmental protection, but it’s also a huge opportunity for resource . efficiency.’","Governments will be 'encouraged' to introduce charges or ban bags .

A massive snowstorm, the season's fifth, is set to dump over a foot of snow on the Northeast this weekend. Boston, New York, Philadelphia and their suburbs are bracing themselves for the season’s biggest snowstorm as it steams up the Atlantic coast just in time to snarl weekend plans. A nasty mix of freezing rain, sleet and snow will plague coastal sections while inland areas can expect to see more than a foot of snow. Wintry conditions: A mall worker is pictured in Illinois as the snowstorm moves toward the East Coast . Here it comes!: A powerful winter storm will wallop the Northeast this weekend . The nasty weather is the child of two separate storms – an arctic cold front moving over the Great lakes, and a strong low pressure system spinning along the coastline – that are expected to collide and wreak havoc over the Northeast, forecasters said. Known as a nor'easter, the coastal storms often cause coastal flooding and have been known to send storm surges into coastal towns. ‘This next system is really going to be a very significant storm for a lot of the country,’ Weather Channel meteorologist Carl Parker told NBC News. ‘It’s going to grab up plenty of moisture off the Atlantic, throw it back and into the Northeast,’ he added. Tens of millions of people can expect travel to come to a halt as wintry weather grounds planes, snarls traffic and makes roads dangerous. A large area: The storm will affect millions of people as it dumps as much as 18 inches of snow . No escape: Flights will be grounded, and traffic will be backed up as snow, sleet and freezing rain bring travel to a halt . Two-day event: The storm will last into Sunday for Boston and New England, but should be mostly over by Sunday morning for New York and Philadelphia . More on the way: People make their way across the Brooklyn Bridge during the season's first snow storm on December 10 . The storm is expected to start impacting New York and Philadelphia from Saturday morning until early Sunday, and should affect New England for most of Sunday. Big cities New York and Philadelphia should expect to see about five inches of snow, Boston could see as much as 8 inches, according to forecasters.

The parents of a seven-year-old boy are desperately trying to raise £255,000 in 11 days so he can have life-saving treatment for a brain tumour that was originally diagnosed as a migraine. Jasmine and Rad Novakovic are making a desperate public appeal to help send son Alex for specialist radiotherapy in America. From a standing start, the couple have already succeeded in raising almost £60,000 from well-wishers in just three days. Alex complained of headaches and nausea for three months and Jasmine, 41, took him several times to her GP and for hospital tests. Alex's parents launched the fundraising appeal when they discovered that proton bean therapy in America was his only chance of survival . But instead of diagnosing his brain tumour, doctors diagnosed a migraine and even suspected scarlet fever. It was only when Alex collapsed suddenly at the dinner table on November 15 that he was correctly diagnosed by doctors at Oxford’s John Radcliffe Hospital. But by then his malignant brain tumour was so far advanced that it was thought to be terminal. Since then, Alex has had endless tests, scans, surgery and intensive chemotherapy for his stage 4 tumour. At one stage, he was given only days to live but neurosurgeons managed to remove some of the tumour. Few hospitals worldwide offer the proton radiotherapy Alex needs quickly to survive and nearly all have long waiting lists. But Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston said it can treat Alex for six weeks from April 30 and doctors there say there is every chance he would make a full recovery. Delay: Alex complained of headaches and nausea for three months. Despite repeated visits to doctors and hospital tests, his parents were told he just had a migraine . The expensive proton beam treatment is not available on the NHS and Jasmine and husband Rad, 53, have to pay the hospital fees up front. There are other conventional radiotherapy options in this country but there would be more side effects and his chances of survival would be slim. Alex, who has three sisters - Kristina, 13, Victoria, 11 and Elizabeth, 3 - has been off school since November. Jasmine is trying to get celebrities to highlight Alex’s plight and singer Joss Stone and TV presenter Jeff Brazier have already lent their support. Joss alerted all her fans on Facebook and since then donations have poured in with £56,500 raised in just three days. Jasmine, from Aylesbury, Bucks, said: 'Alex was complaining of headaches and feeling sick on and off for several months and taking a lot of time off school. Treatment: Alex has had endless tests, scans, surgery and intensive chemotherapy for his stage 4 tumour . 'I took him to the doctor on a few occasions but he only diagnosed a migraine and sent us away. 'He actually vomited in the doctor’s surgery on one occasion. 'I . took him as an emergency case to Stoke Mandeville Hospital and they . thought it might be scarlet fever and gave him antibiotics. 'Then one night at dinner he said he was feeling unwell and asked to leave the table. As he got up, he collapsed.' Alex was rushed to Stoke Mandeville where he had an MRI scan before being taken to John Radcliffe Hospital. Jasmine said: 'I feel devastated that his brain tumour could have been picked up much earlier. 'One of the John Radcliffe surgeons said that even a month sooner would have meant a better prognosis. 'I can’t describe how awful it has been since Alex collapsed. To be given the news that the tumour was terminal and there was nothing they could do was soul-destroying. 'They said that the tumour had progressed so rapidly that they had to try and take as much out as possible. Doctors at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston say there is every chance he will make a full recovery when treated with proton beam therapy . 'Alex recovered from that remarkably well and since then he has been having chemotherapy. 'He . lost his hair but he is a strong, brave, mature boy. I have told him I . am trying to get him better treatment in America and he understands . that. 'Conventional . radiotherapy targets not just the cancer but all the healthy organs and . tissue and we have been told Alex would have a slim chance of survival. Proton radiotherapy only targets the cancer. 'We've been warned it was unlikely anyone would take Alex because of his prognosis. 'There are long waiting lists; so many people are turned away; and we would not have time to organise it anyway.' But Jasmine’s brother Daniel O’Brien, 31, contacted Massachusetts General Hospital and persuaded them to review Alex’s scans. Jasmine . said: 'They e-mailed me and said that Alex would be a great candidate . for proton radiotherapy and that they felt he had every chance of being . cured. Hope: The fundraising appeal has so far raised £270,000 . 'I have spoken to mothers of other English children who have had the treatment there and made a full recovery. 'I am flabbergasted that this opportunity has arisen as a result of my brother pushing it. Getting this opportunity to go to Boston feels like winning the lottery. 'The last few months have been like a bad dream in and out of hospitals. This has given me so much hope.' Board game designer Rad has not worked since Alex was diagnosed in November and the family cannot afford the expensive hospital fees. Jasmine said: 'I have promised the hospital in America that I will find the money. 'They said that we had to pay up front. I asked whether we can have longer to pay but have not heard back yet. 'I’ve never done anything like this before. I’m just a housewife.' Jasmine thanked Joss for her help, saying: 'We really appreciate what she is doing for Alex.'

"By . Ryan Kisiel . PUBLISHED: . 17:39 EST, 2 June 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 08:35 EST, 3 June 2013 . The BBC was at the heart of a homophobic scandal last night after a radio programme asked how lesbian presenter Clare Balding could be ‘turned around’. Broadcast before the watershed, the show also argued that ‘there is no woman that can’t be cured’ from homosexuality.' Contestants were also invited to debate why Miss Balding, who works across a wide range of BBC programmes and other television channels, should be made to present racing coverage topless. Shocking: The show debated how to turn Clare Balding straight. Pictured here with her partner Alice Arnold . The offensive comments were made during the live quiz show Fighting Talk on Radio 5 Live on Saturday at 8.30pm - half an hour before the 9pm watershed. Last night the BBC ‘apologised unreservedly’ for any offence caused by the show but it was still available through their iPlayer service on the internet. It comes six years after the Corporation received 50,000 complaints from listeners disgusted by the obscene phone calls made by Russell Brand and Jonathan Ross to actor Andrew Sachs about his granddaughter on Radio 2. In the latest bout of bad taste Colin Murray asked contestants, during a section called ‘Defend the Indefensible’, to argue: ‘Give me 20 minutes with her and I’m pretty sure I could turn around Clare Balding’. Vulgar: Contestants were invited to debate why balding should be made to present horse racing topless . Sigh: Loud groans were heard from the large audience that was watching the show at the Liverpool Echo Arena . Comedian Bob Mills then stated that the . former jockey and racing presenter was a ‘horse woman’ who ‘appreciates . power between her thighs’. He added: ‘And we all know, there is no woman . that can’t be cured’. His response was met by loud groans from the large audience that was watching the show at the Liverpool Echo Arena as part of the stations Big Day Out event. During a later episode of the same show broadcast at 11pm, host Murray asked another tawdry question involving Miss Balding. Inappropriate: Bob Mills said 'We all know, there is no woman that 'can't be cured'. He set as the subject for the same Defend the Indefensible debate that Channel 4 should get Miss Balding to ‘present the Derby topless’. Ben Summerskill, chief executive of gay rights pressure group Stonewall, described the comments as ‘canteen bullying from the 1960s’. He added: ‘We have warned the BBC for some time that there were problems in their live sports programmes because they have not formally trained staff in what is simply wrong. ‘The BBC should be doing better than this. Given that Clare is employed right across broadcasting and doing loads about the gender gap in sport single handed, we would have thought the BBC would have wanted to keep her happy.’ It is not clear why Miss Balding, who is the daughter of the Queen’s former horse trainer Ian Balding, and is the civil partner of Alice Arnold, a Radio 4 newsreader, was targeted by the show. She had been leading Channel 4’s coverage of the Epsom Derby that day and has recently signed a deal with BT to head the presenting of its new sports coverage with a weekly show. Miss Balding has previously appeared on Fighting Talk and is friends with the show’s host and some of its comedians. Last week, the 42-year-old presenter, said that women on television were judged by their looks while male colleagues on their knowledge. She said: ‘We look at women and we judge, whereas we listen to men and we judge. Their voice as in what they say is stronger than their look. Ms Balding, who recently won a Bafta, also added that she has been criticised for how she looked, but that she tries not to let it affect her. She said: ‘I know that when I’m on TV, I’ll get a lot of comments about my personal appearance. It’s demoralising but it shouldn’t be destructive.’ Jonathan Ross was forced to resign after he and Russell Brand left for veteran actor Andrew Sachs, of Fawlty Towers fame, during a BBC Radio 2 show, referred to his granddaughter Georgina Baillie, who had an affair with Brand. Ross shouted in crude terms that Brand had slept with the burlesque dancer. The national scandal forced the BBC to into an internal investigation and public apology. A BBC spokesman said: ‘The comments were made during a round called “Defend the Indefensible” which asks panellists to comment on topics which, by their very nature, are blatantly indefensible. However, we would like to apologise unreservedly to anyone who was offended by the live broadcast.’","Argued that there is no woman that can’t be cured’ from homosexuality.'

Alex Salmond’s official Christmas card was revealed today, an imposing artwork of the fourth wise man who turned up too late to see Jesus. The Scottish First Minister has opted for the bleak, sinewy painting of Artaban by Scottish artist Peter Howson. The artwork will be sold to raise money for charity, but some questioned whether its choice for a Christmas card was not very festive. Festive? This painting of the fourth wise man Artaban by Peter Howson will grace the front of the First Minister Alex Salmond's 2013 charity Christmas card . Since 2007 Mr Salmond has raised £148,000 for charities in Scotland through sales of the original artwork and limited edition prints of his official card. Today he unveiled the Howson painting, which will be sold at auction in the New Year with the proceeds shared between the Children's Hospice Association Scotland (Chas), CLIC Sargent, Scottish Catholic International Aid Fund (Sciaf) and Combat Stress, the charity chosen by the artist. He insisted the image of Artaban is a ‘hugely appropriate’ work for his card. Mr Salmond said: ‘The legend of . Artaban, or the fourth wise man, is based on a novel by Henry van Dyke. It tells the tale of a Persian scholar who, delayed by helping the . vulnerable, follows the star to Bethlehem but arrives just too late to . herald the birth of the Christ child. ‘Thirty years on in Jerusalem, at Passover, Artaban is still searching. ‘Now . an old man, he parts with the last of his three gifts to Jesus, a . sapphire, a ruby and a pearl, to save a young girl from slavery. However, in a dying vision, Artaban is comforted that his devotion to . the distressed has secured him entrance to the kingdom of heaven. ‘The story reminds us that hope, faith and self-sacrifice are at the centre of the order of things. ‘I . am very grateful to Peter for donating this outstanding painting. As . you might expect it's a typically powerful image, unmistakeably Howson, . and I am sure it will go on to make a significant figure for these four . very good causes at auction next year.’ Reveal: Mr Salmond unveiled the image with its creator today at Malcolm Sargent House in Prestwick . Each charity will be given a series of limited edition prints of the work to help with their fundraising efforts. The artwork was unveiled today in front of Mr Howson, Mr Salmond and representatives of the charities at an event at Malcolm Sargent House in Prestwick, the holiday home run by CLIC Sargent for young people and their families who are coping with cancer. Charity: Mr Salmond's card has raised thousands of pounds for charity since 2007 . Mr Salmond officially opened the home's playroom earlier this year. Lucy Caldicott, CLIC Sargent's director of fundraising, said: ‘We are grateful for his support and hope the card will raise money to help children and young people with cancer throughout the festive season.’ Chas and Sciaf say they are honoured to be chosen to benefit from the card. Andrew Cameron, chief executive of Combat Stress, said: ‘For most of us the realities of war are far removed from our everyday lives. 'It means a great deal for a war artist like Peter Howson, who served in the Royal Highland Fusiliers and bore witness to the horrors of war in Bosnia and Kosovo, to support us. ‘Peter Howson and the First Minister are signalling, in a very personal way, the importance of specialist treatment for veterans suffering psychological wounds from their service.’ The other artists who have taken part in the Christmas card initiative since its launch are John Lowrie Morrison, the late John Bellany, Gerard Burns, Jack Vettriano, Alasdair Gray and Dame Elizabeth Blackadder.","Scottish First Minister unveils his official charity card for 2013 .

Claims: Lloyd Breach, who has been jailed for two years for 13 sexual offences against three girls, was allegedly reported to authorities five years ago . A paedophile could have been stopped five years before he abused three young girls, it has been claimed today. Lloyd Breach, 21, was jailed for two years after admitting 13 sexual offences against three girls - one aged just 13. But today a mother claims she reported Breach - who once appeared on the Jeremy Kyle Show - to police in 2008, when he was just 16 years old. She says the man, a former doorman, groomed her two young daughters. The woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, claims she told Sussex Police that Breach had sex with her 15-year-old daughter before making online advances towards her younger sister. But police allegedly told her it was ‘just what teenagers get up to’ and there was nothing they could do because Breach was 16 - just a year older than her daughter. The mother said: 'He made contact with my daughter via Facebook and kept messaging her to say he wanted to see her. 'Then in the school summer holidays he came over to my house and told my daughter, who had just turned 15, to have sex with him - it was done in my bed. 'She was under the age of consent so it was statutory rape but nothing was done. 'Breach then tried to speak to my younger daughter last year when she was only 15.' The woman continued: 'Breach preys on young children, and aged 13 to 15 they are still children because they cannot make those types of decisions. 'He goes for them because he thinks he can control them and make them do what he wants. 'His victims suffer for life and are left traumatised while he gets a lesser sentence. 'Children need to be protected from him to make sure he doesn’t do this again.' Allegations: The woman says Breach, a former doorman (pictured), slept with her 15-year-old daughter before making advances towards her younger sister . Sussex Police declined to comment about . the mother’s 2008 statement, because they said that Breach was . subject to another police inquiry. Breach admitted two offences of sexual assault, an offence of inciting a girl aged between 13 and 15 to engage in sexual activity, two offences of grooming, one count of attempted grooming and seven charges relating to the possession of indecent images. Sentenced at Hove Crown Court this month, Breach from Ifield, West Sussex, was also placed on the Sex Offenders Register for ten years. DC Mark Butcher said: 'This man preyed on young girls who were brave enough to come forward to talk about his actions. 'He groomed two girls and committed further offences against another girl. 'I am pleased he pleaded guilty to these crimes and that he has been punished accordingly. 'I would urge anyone who has been subject of any kind of sexual abuse to report it to police and we will give them all the support they need.'","Lloyd Breach, 21, jailed for two years after admitting 13 sexual offences .

Julie Bailey exposed horrific neglect at an NHS hospital and has been honoured with a CBE . A whistleblower who exposed horrific neglect at an NHS hospital is honoured with a CBE today. Julie Bailey was forced to flee her home town and sell her business following death threats after she revealed her mother’s appalling treatment at Stafford Hospital, where neglect cost up to 1,400 lives. She started the pressure group Cure the NHS to campaign for better care and helped to force an official inquiry into failings at the hospital. But Miss Bailey faced abuse and hate mail herself after she was wrongly blamed for the closure of local healthcare services. She said her CBE was ‘an important acknowledgement of our struggle for a better NHS’ and dedicated it to the memory of her mother Bella, who died at Stafford in 2007. Miss Bailey said: ‘I am certain that my Mum would be extremely proud of me and it is to her I dedicate not only this award but also our continuing struggle for a safer health service.’ The mother-of-two’s campaign came at great personal cost and she was forced to leave her home and move into a static caravan to escape threats against her. She has since moved abroad and hopes to launch Cure the NHS as a national charity, to maintain pressure for better standards of care. The Francis Inquiry into serious failings at Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust highlighted ‘appalling and unnecessary suffering of hundreds of people’ and made 290 recommendations for change. Miss Bailey told inquiry chair Robert Francis QC that patients were left ‘screaming out’ in pain on chaotic and under-staffed wards.

Mr Mizen said Jimmy’s whole family were now involved in the campaign, saying: ‘We weren’t expecting anything at all like this. We’re really chuffed. ‘It’s in memory of a fine and decent young lad whose legacy will be one of peace and community cohesion.’ Head of the civil service Sir Bob Kerslake said it was vital that the New Year’s Honours list should reflect the work of community stalwarts.

A lawsuit has been filed against Facebook claiming the social-networking site is systematically snooping on private messages to mine data that it sells to advertisers. Matthew Campbell from Pulaski County, Arkansas, and Michael Hurley from North Plains, Oregon, argue that Facebook has ‘systematically violated consumers’ privacy by reading its users’ personal, private Facebook messages without their consent’. The suit claims that the messages are scanned if an address to a third-party website is included in the message. Lawsuit: Two Americans are suing Facebook for allegedly spying on private messages and profiting from the data mined . This link is then analysed to build a profile of the user, it argues. According to the suit, independent security researchers have discovered that Facebook analyses users’ private messages not to aid their transmission, but to ‘mine… data and profit from those data by sharing them with third parties, namely advertisers, marketers, and other data aggregators’. Users, it reasons, 'are likely to reveal facts about themselves that they would not reveal had they known the content was being monitored'. Facebook, it says, is in violation of the Electronic Communications Privacy Act. It adds that Facebook has cloaked these activities from its users, but ‘is candid about these activities in its technical guidance for web developers’. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg: His social-networking site boasts more than one billion users worldwide . A Facebook spokesperson said: ‘We continue to believe the allegations in this lawsuit have no merit and we will defend ourselves vigorously.’ Computer expert Graham Cluley said: ‘I don’t see anything necessarily wrong in principle with online services automatically scanning messages between individuals, and examining the links that they are sharing. ‘Indeed, if Facebook’s security team didn’t have such systems in place I would believe them to be disturbingly lax in their duty of care for users. ‘After all, if you didn’t properly scan and check links there’s a very real risk that spam, scams, phishing attacks, and malicious URLs designed to infect recipients’ computers with malware could run rife.’","Facebook says the allegations 'have no merit' and has vowed to defend itself .

Pledge: Criminal justice major Tyler Lawrence, 19, lost a testicle following a fraternity initiation ritual in which he was struck in his privates . Ohio's Wilmington College has barred historic fraternity Gamma Phi Gamma after a 19-year-old pledge had a testicle surgically removed following a failed Halloween hazing incident. Tyler Lawrence underwent emergency surgery after students hit him in the groin with a knotted towel on October 30, severely damaging one testicle. A judicial board has now 'permanently extinguished' the rights of America's oldest fraternity which will no longer be recognized as a Greek organization at the college. 'This is really incongruent with our values what happened that night,' college president Jim Reynolds told Dayton Daily News. 'It’s still an incident that I think has taken a toll on the campus. I think we’re all trying to understand better why something like this happened on our campus.' The fraternity, which claims to have existed since 1907, appealed the ruling but the punishment was upheld. The Smoking Gun reported Lawrence was pledging to the Greek organization along with two other young men inside the Gamma Phi Gamma house, dubbed 'Gobbler House,' located off the Wilmington College campus, when he was injured. The trouble began when the students were . blindfolded and led down into the basement of 'Gobbler House,' which had . been filled with about three inches of water. They were then ordered to lie on the wet floor and pretend they were swimming. Afterwards, the men were instructed to remove all of their clothes except for the blindfold. As . the students stood naked in the basement, one of the fraternity members . allegedly rubbed a substance similar to the muscle balm Icy Hot on . their nipples, backs, buttocks and scrotums. House of horrors: The initiation ceremony took place in the basement of . Gamma Phi Gamma's off-campus fraternity house, nicknamed Gobbler House . after its turkey mascot . Torment: The pledges were rubbed with an Icy Hot-like substance on their buttocks, nipples and scrotums, and were later forced to eat Limburger cheese (right) According to a police affidavit, about 20 . Gamma Phi Gamma members either actively participated in the ritual or . watched from the sidelines. As part of the initiation, the pledges had Limburger cheese stuffed into their mouths and were ordered to simulate a sexual act with a 'ball of stuffing'. Things took a dangerous turn when, according to the police affidavit, the fraternity members hit the pledges with towels and shirts that had their ends tied in knots. Lawrence was struck in the testicles and crumpled to the ground, clutching his injured groin in pain, the affidavit stated. The criminal justice major was then helped to his feet, and the rite continued with the brothers stuffing bananas soaked in vinegar into the mouths of the three pledges, who were told that they were eating excrement. Following the 'Gobbler House' initiation, Lawrence complained of severe pain in his groin and was rushed to Clinton Memorial Hospital, where doctors had to cut off a testicle that was damaged in the alleged hazing. The police affidavit also noted that the teenager suffered bruising and contusions to much of his upper body. The following day, police officers arrived at the off-campus frat house armed with a search warrant and seized towels with balled ends, icy-hot balm and other items allegedly used in the initiation. Officials at the Quaker-affiliated liberal arts college suspended the Gamma Phi Gamma fraternity. Crackdown: Wilmington College, the Quaker-affiliated liberal arts . institution, has barred the fraternity following the hazing ritual . Outraged: College president Jim Reynolds called the hazing ritual 'disgusting and despicable' However at the time of the incident, Lawrence jumped to the fraternity's defense, denying allegations of hazing and calling what happened a 'freak accident'. ‘Everything is being hyped up,’ he told the station WKRC. Lawrence said he had been accepted into the fraternity after completing the rite of passage, and his parents supported his decision to stay in Gamma Phi Gamma. ‘We're all just sticking together as brothers do,’ he said. ‘I love every one of those guys in there [and] they all love me.' Now, the fraternity's sanction means the group can no longer participate in any campus events. College spokesman Randy Sarvis said the fraternity unsuccessfully appealed the suspension. It can make a final appeal to college president Jim Reynolds, but it wasn't clear if that would happen. Police have been conducting a criminal investigation in the case, but they have not disclosed whether criminal charges would be filed.","Ohio's Wilmington College has banned Gamma Phi Gamma fraternity .

Winning ticket: Steve Tran bought this ticket from San Jose - and won the lottery with line 'C' A delivery driver has realized he is the winner of a $324 million jackpot that was drawn two weeks ago after returning from a family holiday and finally remembering to check his ticket numbers. After finding out about the massive win, Steve Tran, from Northern California, immediately called his boss and quit his job. He will share the $636 million Mega Millions jackpot with another winner, Ira Curry, a grandmother from Stone Mountain, Georgia, who also picked the winning numbers. Tran's identity was released by the California Lottery in a press release on Friday but he declined to appear at a press conference. The California Lottery explained that he had bought five tickets at a store in San Jose the Saturday before the draw while visiting the city with his family. When he returned home, he added the . tickets to a pile he had picked up from other cities while working as a . delivery driver, put them on his dresser and entirely forgot about them. As . two winners of the huge jackpot - the second biggest in U.S. history - . were announced, Tran joined other Californians in wondering about the . identity of the lucky winner in their state. 'Everybody was anxious, looking for the person,' he said, adding that he thought: 'Must be a lucky man.' Winner: He bought the ticket from Thuy Nguyen, pictured at Jenny's Gifts in San Jose while on a family trip. Nguyen was given $1 million by the California Lottery for selling the winning ticket . Scene: Tran bought five tickets from Jenny's Gifts but then forgot about them until 2 weeks later . He and his family then went on vacation and when they returned home earlier this week, something clicked in Tran in the middle of the night. 'I woke up in the middle of the night,' he said. 'I remembered, I think I went to San Jose.' He raced to his tickets and learned that he had hit the jackpot, before waking his wife with the good news and calling his boss. 'I'm . really sorry boss,' he said in a message on the man's machine. 'I hit . the jackpot. I don't think I’m going to come in today, tomorrow, or . ever.' The lottery did not . say how he has opted to take the money, but he has six days to decide. If he opts to take the lump sum payment, he will receive about $120 . million after taxes. Thanks . to Tran buying the ticket in California, he is not the only winner: the . gift shop owner who sold him the winning ticket will also receive $1 . million. 'When people hear . jackpot winner was sold here, everybody want to come here,' said shop . owner Thuy Nguyen, who only took over four months ago. Luck: Nguyen, who took over the store four months ago, is pictured receiving his $1 million check . The other winner, Ira Curry, came . forward to claim her prize on December 18, the day after the numbers . were drawn. She opted to take the lump sum payment. The . jackpot is the second-largest lottery prize in U.S. history. It started . its ascent on October 4 and lottery officials said 22 draws came and . went without winners. Some $336 million in tickets were sold for the December 17 drawing. Curry, . a married mother and an underwriting manager for an insurance firm, had . previously declared bankruptcy - but now her financial troubles are . over. She purchased the . ticket at the Gateway Newsstand in the Alliance Center building in . Buckhead, a financial center in Atlanta where she works. It is unclear . whether she has remained in her job. Winner: Ira Curry, a grandmother and underwriter from Georgia, was the other winner to split the prize . Home: Curry lives in this Stone Mountain home, on the outskirts of Atlanta, with her husband . When she was revealed as the Georgia winner, she had not yet decided what to spend her win on and was 'gonna take some time and think about it', a lottery spokesperson said. Unlike in California, the Georgia newsstand that sold Curry her winning ticket will not receive a bonus payment. The winning numbers were 8, 14, 17, 20, 39 and the mega ball was 7, and the two winners matched all six numbers. The biggest ever jackpot was in March 2012, when it reached $656million.

Struggling Canadian mobile phone maker Blackberry is suing ‘American Idol’ host Ryan Seacrest over a much-hyped physical keyboard adapter for iPhones. Typo, the Seacrest-backed startup making the physical keyboard, is being sued because Blackberry feels the keyboard design borrows a little too much inspiration from north of the border - Mr Seacrest is one of Typo's major backers. ‘This is a blatant infringement against BlackBerry’s iconic keyboard, and we will vigorously protect our intellectual property against any company that attempts to copy our unique design,’ Blackberry lawyer Steve Zipperstein said in a statement. Unoriginal: Ryan Seacrest-backed Typo is being sued by Blackberry for copyright infringement over the design of it's iPhone keyboard cases . The lawsuit filed in San Francisco federal court contends Typo’s keyboard violates Blackberry’s intellectual property rights and seeks unspecified damages. Blackberry keyboards are what positioned the handhelds as the go-to device for on the go professionals before the iPhone debuted in 2007. Blackberry stalwarts often lament their touchscreen typing woes when defending their continued use of the antiquated devices despite more feature-rich options being readily available. The $99 keyboard is actually the bottom half of a case that slides over the back of any iPhone 5 or 5S. It appears to connect to the bottom of the phone, but really works via Bluetooth, wirelessly transmitting keystrokes to the iPhone. Looks similar: The keyboards do bear a striking resemblance to those made by Blackberry . The keyboard, which bears a striking resemblance to the one found on most recent Blackberry handhelds, is currently available for pre-order on Typo’s website. Shipments are scheduled to begin this month. Mr Seacrest took such a liking to Typo he invested $1million. The firm is still smarting from a $4.4billion loss last quarter, and is moving to protect what it may feel is one of the differentiators it has left. Blackberry’s stock traded at well over $200 per share just before the first iPhone was released, it now trades at around $7 per share. ‘We are flattered by the desire to graft our keyboard onto other smartphones, but we will not tolerate such activity without fair compensation for using our intellectual property and our technological innovations,’ Mr Zipperstein added. The iconic Blackberry Messenger BBM was . made available to both Android and Apple devices earlier this year, . putting another dent in the company’s once impenetrable enterprise . armor. Not their first time at the rodeo: Typo isn't the first firm sued by Canadian firm for keyboard copyright infringement, a 2002 suit against Handspring resulted in the company licensing keyboard patents from Blackberry . The company also severed ties with high profile celebrity endorser Alicia Keys earlier this week. She was publicly recognized as Blackberry’s creative director, but it is not clear how she served in that capacity. Typo did not immediately respond to a MailOnline message left for comment. A previous suit filed by Blackberry over keyboard patents may signal a possible outcome. The firm sued Handspring in 2002, The Verge noted. Handspring opted to license the patents and Blackberry dropped its claims.","Blackberry accuses Typo of violating the firm's keyboard patents in the lawsuit filed Friday .

Shocked beachgoers spotted a couple with a toddler emerging from the tiny dome tent underneath cliffs at Burton Bradstock, Dorset. The family ignored warning signs and spent the night camping illegally on the stone beach less than 24 hours after a landslide at nearby East Cliff at West Bay. Danger zone: A family ignored clear warning signs to pitch a tent at the foot an unstable 150ft cliff - just metres from where a holidaymaker was killed by falling rocks . The campers were just down the beach from where Charlotte Blackman, 22, was killed by a 400-tonne landslide a year ago. The couple pitched their tent within feet of a sign reading 'Danger - rockfalls. Serious risk of injury or death. Stay away from the cliffs'. Overnight camping is banned on the Jurassic Coast's beaches as they are owned by the National Trust. Walker Doug Randle, 58, from Weymouth, took a photograph after seeing a man and a woman emerge from the tent with a toddler. He . said: 'I was aware of the recent landslip at West Bay so I was so . surprised to see a couple, along with their small child, camping . underneath these unstable cliffs. 'Without a doubt this family was dicing with death and risking their lives. 'I couldn't believe what I was seeing. 'They emerged unhurried and seemingly oblivious to the potentially lethal situation they had been in. 'They were camping right next to signs telling them there is a risk of serious injury or death. 'I . wish I'd gone up to them and said: 'why didn't you see the signs?' I . can't believe that even if they arrived in the dark they didn't have . enough illumination to see the signs.'

'There is a very dangerous overhang of the cliff. 'I don't know what else can be done to safeguard some people from themselves.' A Portland Coastguard spokesman reissued the warning about people staying away from unstable areas of cliffs after landslips. He said: 'Do not camp anywhere close to the cliff face - the whole of the coastline is extremely fragile. 'If you are going to walk along the beach, walk along the shoreline. 'Enjoy it, but be conscious that it's fragile.' As if to illustrate the serious dangers for anyone lingering under the cliffs, coastguards have issued a warning to holidaymakers after a cliff fall at the 'vulnerable' section of coast in at West Bay in Dorset. Heavy rainfall at the end of last week is thought to have made the land unstable and crumbly, the Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) said. No-one was injured in the landslip, which happened near Freshwater Beach Holiday Park on Friday and has left the cliff with an overhang. An MCA spokesman said: 'Some sections of the coast around the UK are particularly vulnerable to cliff falls and landslips. 'HM Coastguard is again advising the public to take great care when walking on cliff paths or along beaches, and take note of any warning signs in place.'

Jones, sitting in a wheelchair, appeared at the bond hearing via video from the jailhouse. 'I don't know why I even talked about such a thing,' he said. 'It's not me. I've never hurt anybody in my life. I've done nothing but help people.' But his wife had no sympathy. Remorse: Jones, who worked as a firefighter for 19 years, said he did not know what overcame him . 'This cannot be blamed on medication,' she said through tears. 'This was a sick plan, thought out, to take my life. To leave our kids . with no mother.' Jones, who is on disability after working for the fire department for 19 years, has suffered from depression since a massive fire at a sofa store killed nine other firefighters on June 18, 2007. He was off duty at the time of the blaze but ran to assist his overwhelmed colleagues, and he helped carry their burned bodies from the debris. Jones, who said he suffered physical and emotional injuries in the fire, took early retirement after panic attacks and anxiety left him unable to work. He was also forced to give up his successful plumbing business, which had helped him support his family. Life changing: He has suffered from depression since losing 9 of his colleagues to a fire in 2007 . Inferno: He carried the burned bodies of his fellow firefighters from the burning sofa shop after discarded cigarettes started the blaze. He is on disability and is suing the store for its allegedly unsafe practices . 'That night changed a lot of us,' Jones told the Post and Courier in 2009. 'The only thing I've ever known is firefighting, and now I can't . even stand to hear the sound of a siren.' Jones, who was one of six firefighters to be granted disability following the fire, settled a workers' compensation case against the city of Charleston, getting $108,000. After the blaze, he filed a lawsuit against Sofa Super Store over the fire, blaming the store's owners for allegedly installing flammable roofing and ceiling products with safety systems like sprinklers. It is believed the fire was started by unattended cigarettes in a loading dock and fire experts concluded that inadequate training, outdated tactics and old equipment contributed to the death, the Post and Courier reported.

The pair were pulled from the sea and . given CPR aboard a helicopter from RAF Valley, where Prince William is . stationed, but the father could not be revived. His son is in a critical condition at Ysbyty Gwynedd Hospital, in Bangor, but said to be 'improving'. The tragedy happened on Friday afternoon while the family from Manchester were holidaying in the area. Locals said the two boys were bodysurfing - lying flat on the waves without a board and being swept in to shore. A police spokesman confirmed an older man went into the sea after seeing the boys in need of help.

A Swedish man was left with part of a glass bottle inside his cheek for over two weeks after several doctors failed to spot it. Patrik Moberg, 23, was glassed in the face during a brawl on a one-day cruise to Finland, and was sewed up on the boat. Back in Sweden, his wound kept bleeding, and it took five hospital visits before a doctor found that the entire bottom of the glass bottle was still embedded inside his cheek. Medical malpractice: Patrik Moberg had this piece of glass in his face for 17 days after four doctors missed it . Mr Moberg was celebrating a friend’s birthday with a cruise to Åbo in Finland when a man pushed him outside the club. ‘I was in the corridor when he walked into my shoulder. When I told him “that was unnecessary” he came at me again and smashed me in the face with a bottle,’ he told Aftonbladet. The onboard medic stiched up the wound, but somehow missed the large piece of class in his cheek. When the boat returned to shore, Mr Moberg wanted to report the assault, and visited Linköping University Hospital. He says he told staff he felt something hard in his cheek, but doctors did not x-ray his face, and instead settled with taking pictures for a potential trial.

True Viking: Mr Moberg, pictured after the piece of glass was finally discovered as he was heading in to surgery, had a bleeding wound for over two weeks but says 'what's done is done' He was told to let the wound heal, but several days later the stitches did not stop bleeding and Mr Moberg had to change his bandaging throughout the day. He visited doctor number three, at a local care centre, but still no x-ray was carried out. Instead they examined the wound and determined that the ‘hard part’ underneath Mr Moberg’s skin was coagulated blood, and gave him penicillin for the healing process. ‘I started wondering if maybe they had forgotten a part of the bottle, but also thought it would have been unlikely that they could have missed such a big thing inside my cheek,’ Mr Moberg says.

A fascinating map has been released online that demonstrates the staggering advances technology has made to commuters embarking on one day of travel from New York City. Less than a quarter of a century after the Declaration of Independence, Philadelphia was still more than 24-hours away from the nation's largest city, but over the course of 134-years, Los Angeles was reachable in the same amount of time. The map reveals the transition of horse carriage to train as technology opened up the continent - eventually giving way to the airline boom of the 1930s, which meant that nowhere on the 48-contiguous states was more than one day away. One day of travel: This is a representation of the map that Charles O. Paullin published as the monumental Atlas of the Historical Geography of the United States which has been published online by the Digital Scholarship Lab at The University of Richmond . The map is in fact compiled from the legendary Atlas of the Historical Geography of the United States, which was first published by Charles O. Paullin in 1932 and contained over 700 examples of every aspect of the nation's expansion from British colony to continental power. In addition to the opening up of the nation by rail and air, the maps documented population explosions, presidential elections and even shipping times from New York to North Carolina. Thirty years time: In 1800 it was impossible to get to Philadelphia from New York and New Orleans was a month away by stagecoach - while by 1830 these times had essentially been halved as the railroads across the United States began to become established . The golden spike: The transcontinental railroad across the United States opened up travel from West to East Coast - and put most of the Northeast and Midwest within 2 days of New York - but San Francisco and the West Coast were still up to a month away . Philadelphia, where the Founding Father's wrote and signed the Constitution, opened up as a day-trip to New Yorker's around 1830. However, the nation's captial at Washington D.C. was still over one days travel from the cultural and financial center of the fledgling United States. As the nation's railroads were established, travel times were essentially halved, but by 1930, it was still just possible to reach St. Louis by train. Obviously, destinations reachable within one day spectacularly shortened and by 1930 a plane journey put Denver within reach of all travelers. Advances: After more than 70 years of transcontinental rail travel - commuters and travelers were able to traverse the 48-contiguous states with three days - a staggering shortening in times . In 1934, TWA made the East-West coast divide less than a day, when they pioneered a three-stop airline service between New York and Los Angeles that took a total of 18-hours to complete. Paullin's incredibly detailed maps were turned into modern interactive, motion-picture maps by the University of Richmond's Digital Scholarship Lab - ready to be poured over by the iPad generation. Fliers: However, while the railroads were now offering to put the nation's largest cities in reach of one another - air travel finally put Los Angeles within one day's travel - all by the third decade of the 20th century . The one-day time estimates themselves were made by Paullin and his team and in one revealing snippet from the original text, he states that in 1800 stagecoach runs from New York would fail to leave the Northeast while a trip to Charleston, South Carolina would take a staggering 10 days of sailing. Paullin's maps were viewed as visionary when they were released - as their demonstrations of time changes and technological changes revealed the growth of the nation. Thirty years time: In 1800 it was impossible to get to Philadelphia from New York and New Orleans was a month away by stagecoach - while by 1830 these times had essentially been halved as the railroads across the United States began to become established . Presidential victor: This map shows how each county voted in the 1892 general election won by Democrat Grover Cleveland against Benjamin Harrison and Populist Party candidate James B. Weaver . Given fresh new life by their digital re-haul, the maps of travel times act as a testament to infrastructure changes and technological advancements. The 'golden spike' that was driven into the ground to mark the completion of the United State's transcontinental railway was hit in 1869 and of course automobiles became mass produced in 1908 with the Model T Ford. 'It’s so far ahead of its time,' Edward L. Ayers, the founder of the Digital Scholarship Lab and a senior consultant on the project said to the New York Times. 'It suggests how people experienced geography. You could ask, ‘What would it mean for a family to move to Kansas?’","University of Richmond's Digital Scholarship Lab releases the legendary Atlas of the Historical Geography of the United States in digital form .

Coining it 'The Pound a Day Diet' he is set to release a dieting book under the same name next week. 'Everyone thinks I look younger,' he exclaimed. 'Some people think I had plastic surgery, which I take as a compliment.' Along with cutting back on portion sizes he also started working out twice a day. What's his secret? In a bid to slim down and get healthy he developed a weight-loss plan that restricted his calorie intake to 850 during weekdays and 1,200 at weekends . Instantly the self-described former 'chubby chef with a crooked spine and flat feet,' lost 10lbs which spurred him on to lose more. Three months later he completed his first sprint triathlon. A year later in 2009, and 30lbs lighter, he completed a  70.3 mile-long Ironman. Now four years on he has managed to maintain his slimmer physique and touts his diet as something sustainable on a long-term basis. He told TV host Piers Morgan last month: 'If I can do it, anyone can do it . . . I am surrounded by the most delicious food available on the planet every day of my life.' Along with the threat of heart disease the born and bred New Yorker said his waning love life also prompted the shift. New Year, a new you: 'The Pound a Day Diet' is out next week .

While he is confident that his Pound A Day Diet is the key to fighting the bulge, some critics have deemed it as 'too restrictive' and 'unhealthy.' Indeed, Keri Gans, who reviewed the eating manual for Shape magazine wrote: 'The title of this book alone bothers me. No one - I repeat, no one - should be looking to lose a pound a day. 'First off, it isnâ€™t healthy. Let's be honest, 850 calories is way, way too few. Even 1,200 calories is low for the average women who is engaging in any sort of moderate-intensity excercise. Sure you will lose weight, but at what cost mentally and physically? 'Research shows that rapid weight loss (anything more than one to two pounds per week) may lead to gallstones, dehydration, malnutrition, and electrolyte imbalances. 'Other possible side effects include headaches, irritability, fatigue, dizziness, constipation, menstrual irregularities, hair loss, and muscle loss.' Dishes featured in Mr DiSpirito's plan include salmon teriyaki with grapefruit which stacks up to 200 calories and an egg-white omelet with reduced-fat cheddar cheese which rings in at only 70 calories.

Everyone dreads the stress of Christmas shopping with the huge crowds fighting for a bargain and the overcrowded car parks. Now, a psychologist has claimed the experience is so painful that it sparks the primal ‘fight or flight’ mechanism. Dr David Lewis, founder of the independent research consultancy Mindlab International, says people become aggressive while they are doing their shopping because the swarming crowds activate basic survival mechanisms. Psychologist Dr David Lewis has claimed the experience of Christmas shopping is so painful that it sparks the 'fight or flight' mechanism . He added that the experience can also cause exhaustion and anxiety as well as guilt and feelings of inadequacy, The Telegraph reports. He says people who live in the countryside are most at risk of adverse effects as they are not used to the crowds. Dr Lewis told the paper: ‘Festive cheer all too easily gives way to seasonal shopping stress. ‘The presence of other people is a major factor. Other people present a great threat and strangers are more of a threat. ‘You can begin to see people who are moving more slowly than you, such as an elderly person, as the enemy. It leads to shopping rage.’ He explained that in these circumstances, a person’s heart rate increases, they sweat more and their body starts to produce cortisol – the stress hormone. He said this can promote aggression but that it can also make people want to escape meaning some will leave a trolley full of shopping as they cannot bear to spend any more time in the crowd. There is, however, some good news for shoppers. People become aggressive while they are doing their shopping because the swarming crowds activate basic survival mechanisms. It also makes some people anxious and exhausted . Dr Lewis says there are ways to make the experience less stressful. He says people should draw up a shopping list as this makes it easier to avoid unnecessary impulse buys. His second tip is that people should not shop while hungry as they buy more food when they are hungry and then end up throwing a lot of it away. He added that shoppers should walk away and think carefully before purchasing expensive presents as once they have walked away they will often change their mind. Finally, he said that people should do as much shopping as possible online so that when they do hit the shops they can take in the festive atmosphere in a more relaxed fashion.","Dr David Lewis says people become aggressive while doing their shopping because the swarming crowds activate basic survival mechanisms .

A National Rifle Association television ad targeting Democratic West Virginian Senator Joe Manchin for his work with President Barack and New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg to draft new gun control legislation uses a shaded photo of the African-American president that makes him appear darker and, according to some critics - like MSNBC's Joe Scarborough - more sinister. In the ad, Bloomberg's face appears to be shaded, as well, but much less dramatically than the president's . Obama's darker appearance in the ad is being compared to a controversial 1994 Time magazine cover that shows a shaded image of former Buffalo Bills running back O.J. Simpson - who, at the time, was on trial for the brutal murders of his ex-wife and another man - that makes his skin seem much darker than it actually is. Scroll down for watch commercial . Made in the shade: the NRA shaded this photo of President Barack Obama to make him appear darker than he actually is . Notice anything different? The Time magazine cover came at a time when racial tensions across the U.S. began heating up as a result of the Simpson trial, which divided the country along racial lines for a variety of reasons. Specifically, those skeptical about the state's case against Simpson charged that the lead investigator on the case, former Los Angeles Police Department Detective Mark Fuhrman, was racist and had planted evidence to frame the Heisman trophy winner. Critics contend that the Time cover was racist, and was designed to make Simpson look more sinister, and - as an African-American on trial for murder - guilty. Others claimed that the altered image was designed to make it appear more dramatic in an effort to sell more copies of the magazine. Sinister: Pundits are comparing the NRA's ad with this controversial Time magazine cover, where O.J. Simpson's skin is shaded to make him appear darker . James Gaines, the managing editor of the magazine when the now-infamous cover was published, later posted an explanation online. 'It seems to me you could argue that it's racist to say that blacker is more sinister, but be that as it may: To the extent that this caused offense to anyone, I obviously regret it,' Gaines said in his message. The NRA did not respond to Mail Online's request for comment, nor has it responded to any of the criticism that the ad is racist. The NRA dropped more than $100,000 on the ad, which will start airing in West Virginia in two weeks. The ad quotes one of Manchin's videos from his 2010 Senate campaign, in which he says 'As your senator, I'll protect your second amendment rights.' A voiceover in the ad then says, 'That was Joe Manchin's commitment. But now, Manchin is working with President Obama and New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg. Concerned? You should be. Tell Sen. Manchin to honor his commitment to the Second Amendment and reject the Obama-Bloomberg gun control agenda.' Manchin - who has previously received an 'A' rating from the NRA - recently sponsored a bill with Republican Pennsylvania Senator Pat Toomey that would have expanded background checks on gun buyers to include sales at gun shows and over the Internet. In the cross-hairs: Senator Joe Manchin has drawn the ire of the NRA for his plan to expand background checks on gun buyers . The bill failed to get the 60 votes needed to avoid a filibuster, but Manchin recently said that he hopes the Senate would again consider expanding background checks - which is what put him the cross-hairs of the nation's most powerful gun lobby.","The ad is being compared to a controversial Time magazine cover that depicted a photo of O.J.

He has five GCSEs and qualifications in performing arts, but without looking at the lists he makes every day on his iPhone, Ricky Dean would have no idea that he needs to start his morning by brushing his teeth and making breakfast. At birth, Ricky’s brain was starved of oxygen and he lost the capacity from his very first days of life to make memories – a condition that has limited his lifestyle in so many ways. Now aged 19, he has only recently stopped being angry about it. ‘I am learning to live with it – and a sense  of humour helps,’ he says. ‘I can respond to questions, but I’d find it hard to start a conversation, which makes socialising difficult.’ Insight: Ricky Dean, 19, whose brain was starved of oxygen as a baby causing him to lose the capacity from his very first days of life to make memories, is one of three teenagers profiled in a new documentary about young people with amnesia . Ricky, from Taunton, is one of three teenagers profiled in a remarkable new television documentary, The Kids With No Memory, about young people who suffer amnesia. Until they met at a special camp in Yorkshire, they had no idea there were others in the same situation. In fact, experts say there are thousands of sufferers in the UK. Although some are born with the condition or develop it shortly after birth due to brain damage, many others are affected as a result of encephalitis – a swelling of the brain. Ava Easton, chief executive of the Encephalitis Society, says 4,000 new cases are identified every year in the UK. ‘The causes include infection, and the immune system going rogue and attacking healthy tissue,’ she says. ‘It is the herpes simplex virus – chickenpox and cold sores – that is most likely to attack the hippocampus and temporal lobe, the parts of the brain responsible for memory.’ Symptoms of encephalitis include a flu-like illness, exacerbated by more specific warning signs such as seizures or an altered personality. Ava continues: ‘Of those people who . survive encephalitis – the mortality rate is 80 per cent without swift . treatment – seven out of ten respond to the anti-viral drug Aciclovir, . ideally if it  is given within 24 or 48 hours. However, those whose . memory has been attacked are unlikely to recover in that respect, . although what sufferers can develop is better ways of coping with their . condition.’ For amnesia sufferers of all ages, the . society has been running camps in a natural setting with the aim of . building their confidence and self-esteem. ‘Participants will do anything from . horse-riding and working with falcons to wall-climbing or canoeing, and . family members come along with them,’ says Ava. Mystery: Rosie Paley, 18, from the West Midlands, lost her memory at the age of 16 after a family holiday . ‘We aim to run these camps annually, but it’s a question of how often we  can get the money – and we never claim that they can help recover memory. However, we do aim to help sufferers develop confidence and to realise they are not alone.’ Ricky’s father Gary, who works  for Avon and Somerset Police, says: ‘Ricky got so much out of the camp, not least from mentoring kids who are less able. It appealed to his nurturing side. He used to be so angry, disruptive and negative, so it’s remarkable how he has turned his life around with humour and a positive attitude.’ Although scans show the part of Ricky’s brain that controls memory is unlikely ever to improve, he earned a C grade in his maths GCSE. ‘Maths is all about repetition, so it wasn’t that difficult,’ says Ricky, who also passed exams in English language, English literature, science and IT. He currently attends an agricultural college for those with special needs. Ava discovered the value of putting the teenagers together with horses, falcons and other creatures. ‘Connecting with nature and animals enables people to develop their confidence, enjoy a sense of responsibility and in many ways care for something instead of just being the person who is cared for,’ she says. Horse-riding at the camp proved an astonishing breakthrough for Rosie Paley, who lost her memory aged 16 after a holiday. ‘No one really knows what happened to me, but I got encephalitis after falling into some dirty water. It’s possible it may have caused a virus, which was responsible for my loss of memory,’ she says. Rosie, 18, of Brierley Hill, West Midlands, can only remember things that have happened in the past few days, so she had no idea that she used to enjoy horse-riding until she attended the camp. ‘It was so strange. It turns out that I immediately held the reins correctly,’ she says. Her mother Helen, 36, adds: ‘Rosie used to love horse-riding and took lessons for six months, but after her illness she had no recollection of ever having been near a horse, almost to the point of it being a phobia. ‘But once she picked up the reins again and held them, it was if she had never had a problem with horses. She took to it immediately. It was absolutely brilliant to see her starting to return to her old self.’ Rosie’s attempts to stimulate her memory include building a wall of photos. ‘Some have struck a chord, such as one of my little brother Rhys, who’s now aged four,’ she says. ‘It was snowing in the picture, and I could remember pulling him up the drive on a sledge when he was two.’ Although she is focused on finishing a hairdressing diploma, she shares with Ricky a skill for computer work. ‘Although I didn’t get GCSEs before  I became ill, I have since got A* grades in IT,’ she says. ‘I love web design  and have thought about becoming a website designer.’ Rosie is now looking to the future with hope and optimism. ‘You’ve got to be positive, and I’ve learned that there are other people out there like me, so I’m not the only one,’ she says. ‘I can still write, spell and remember a few facts, and keep going with life  so long as I stay in a routine. It’s made all the difference to my life.’","Ricky Dean, 19, and Rosie Paley, 18, both suffer from severe amnesia .

A new device that sends a high-frequency electrical pulse through the spine could revolutionise the treatment of severe back pain, according to a new study. A team at Guy’s and St Thomas’ Hospital, London, is the first in the world to implant the Senza spinal cord stimulator in 100 patients who would otherwise need surgery to stop their back pain. The device is less invasive than surgery and cheaper. Senza therapy uses frequency 200 times higher than current spinal cord stimulation therapy. Pain in the back: The new device sends high-frequency electrical pulses through the spine to aid severe back pain . Dr Adnan Al-Kaisy, consultant in pain management, who led the Senza study, said: ‘This new high-frequency version goes beyond what previous devices could do to give immediate pain relief without any tingling. ‘And we used to have to talk to the patient in the middle of the operation to make sure where they were feeling the tingling sensations. With the Senza device, they can sleep.’ Patients have a wire, connected to a battery pack, inserted into their epidural space. If the electrical current that is emitted stops their pain, they will have this wire removed and replaced by the full Senza implant. The £15,000 implant is switched on using a remote control. At typical settings, patients can use it for at least a day to a few days at a time. Study in pain: Guy's hospital in London is trialling the machine on 100 patients . ‘Patients have no idea whether other kinds of surgery will work, whereas with the Senza they know what to expect,’ says Dr  Al-Kaisy. ‘We give them a trial of the device before going ahead with a permanent implant.’ The procedure will not work for everyone, however. One in three won’t be suitable because previous surgeries have complicated their condition, or their pain is too widespread. Clinical data from a recent European clinical trial shows that the majority of patients (88%) have a successful result. Patients accepted for a trial of the device are also required to undergo a residential course at Guy’s and St Thomas’, which involves cognitive behaviour therapy, relaxation and learning to reduce their pain medication. ‘The sky is the limit as to how many patients we could treat every year, so long as we have the resources and access to an operating theatre,’ says Dr Al-Kaisy.","Spinal cord stimulator sends electrical pulses through the spine .

Failed attempt: FBI agents confirmed that today that they believe former veteran Mario Edward Garnett, 40, was responsible for a series of bank robberies 1,800 miles apart over Christmas and the death of Officer Kevin Gale Stauffer . It has been revealed the man shot dead by police after a suspected 1,800 mile terror-spree of armed robberies which culminated in the fatal shooting of a police officer in Tupelo, Mississippi, was arrested in 2010 for threatening President Obama's life. Federal law officers and the Secret Service have confirmed that Mario Edward Garnett, 40, was indicted in August 2010 after allegedly posting a message on the White House website that promised to 'blow out the brains' of the president on national television if her was to ever 'order a strike on Iran.' Garnett also allegedly threatened the life of Benhamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, and in another message linked to him, posted, 'I'm going to settle some scores on behalf of Israel and America's victims on behalf of those they continue to oppress. I'll kill president and farmer alike.' According to ABC News, the two messages were sent six days apart and have come to light since Garnett's death in a shootout with police outside a Tupelo, Mississippi bank on Saturday in which Officers Kevin Gale Stauffer was killed and Joseph Maher injured. Stauffer, an Iraq War veteran and father of two, was killed. Maher was wounded and is expected to survive. Garnett, 40, was from the Midwest, . had served for four years in the U.S. Army and appeared to have no . friends or relatives in Arizona, Police spokesman James Holmes said at a . Sunday afternoon news conference. Holmes said that it was unclear when Garnett arrived in the state. Twice in one day: Police believe that Mario Edward Garnett is pictured here and is suspected of robbing a Bancorp South bank in Tupelo, Mississippi and another in Atlanta, Georgia . Reign of terror: The robber pulled off two heists in one day before traveling 1,800 miles to Phoenix, where he was killed . The alleged robber, Garnett, was shot dead by a Phoenix police detective during a gun battle with cops on Saturday after they intercepted him when he robbed a bank there - his third heist in just a week. The violence ended a week of mayhem that began Monday morning in Atlanta, Georgia, and sparked a nationwide manhunt. A total reward of more than $200,000 had been offered to anyone with information leading to the arrest of the suspect. FBI agents are confident that the man who died in Phoenix was also responsible for the robberies in Atlanta and Tupelo because his cell phone records show he was in those places at the times of the crimes. Agent Daniel McMullen, also told reporters in in Tupelo that there were 'numerous similarities' between the three bank robberies, including the clothing worn by the suspect, statements he made during the incidents and his 'overall modus operandi.' Wanted man: Police had a reward of  $200,000 on the suspect, who is believed to now be dead . A BancorpSouth surveillance screen shot from Monday of a man holding up the bank with a handgun . McMullen said the FBI believes the suspect killed by Phoenix police was the same person from the Atlanta and Tupelo robberies. Also on Sunday, the Secret Service said Garnett was arrested in 2010 after making online threats against the president. Secret Service spokesman Max Millien said Garnett was living in Oklahoma City at the time of the arrest. Millien would not say how the case was resolved. Surveillance photos from the attempted bank robbery in Atlanta showed a man wearing a black-and-white patterned jacket tried to rob a Bank of America branch around 9:30 a.m. on Dec. 23. He was wearing a black ski mask and black gloves and carrying a handgun. After failing to get any money from a teller, the man demanded and received an undisclosed amount of money from someone who was using an ATM in the bank's lobby. The man was seen leaving in a light gray car with no license plate. Later that same day, the suspect stole an undisclosed amount of money from the BancorpSouth in Tupelo before fleeing in a gray sedan, the FBI has said.

Officers Gale Stauffer and Joseph Maher were responding to a bank alarm and a report that the suspect had fled in a white SUV when they spotted such a vehicle stalled in traffic. The officers were confronting the SUV's driver when the suspect exited the gray sedan, which was stopped behind the SUV, and ambushed the officers, according to McMullen. Stauffer died and was buried Friday after a funeral attended by as many as 1,000 people. Dozens of uniformed officers from Mississippi, Alabama, Tennessee and elsewhere attended the service. Stauffer's wife, Beth, said her family was grateful for investigators' work and for the support they've received. 'We can truly begin the healing process, and that could not have happened without the hard work of so very many,' she told reporters Sunday. 'Gale would be so proud.' Tupelo police Chief Bart Aguirre told the Northeast Mississippi Daily Journal that Maher's condition has improved and he was able to walk some with assistance Friday. Memorial: Dozens attended a candlelit vigil in Tupelo, Mississippi on Christmas Day for the father-of-two . Shaken: Members of the community also held a silence for Officer Joseph Maher, 27, who was also shot by the suspects and remains in hospital in a serious but stable condition . Maher moved out of the intensive care unit at North Mississippi Medical Center and into a private room. The Phoenix shooting happened Saturday morning at a Compass Bank branch in the near-northwest part of the city after someone called 911 to report seeing a man run into the bank while wearing a mask. There were five people inside the bank during the robbery, Holmes said. A customer who ran outside when Garnett turned his attention to the bank manager also called 911. The first officer to arrive saw the man leave the bank with a bag and a handgun. 'The officer drew his service weapon and began giving the suspect commands at which time the suspect raised his weapon and began firing at the officer,' Holmes said in an earlier statement. A detective who had just arrived at the scene shot the suspect, who was pronounced dead after being taken to a Phoenix hospital. No officers or bank employees were injured. Holmes said Garnett drove a rental car to the Phoenix bank. It was unclear where Garnett had been and what he had been doing while in the state. 'We have no idea what he did between the 23rd of December and the 28th of December,' he said.","Authorities today identified the suspect, who was killed Saturday in a .

Sopranos actor Lillo Brancato took to Twitter to announce his release New Year's Eve after serving four years of a ten year sentence for his part in a burglary that resulted in the death of a NYPD officer - to the fury of the dead man's family. Brancato who appeared in early episodes of the critically acclaimed HBO series will be released from the Hudson Correctional Facility and was sentenced in 2009 after the botched home invasion which led to the death of off-duty cop Daniel Enchautegui. The New York City Patrolmen's Benevolent Assocation also said on Monday that they were outraged by this decision and reiterated their belief that Brancato was responsible for Enchautegui's murder - despite him being found guilty only of attempted burglary. Release: Lillo Brancato will be freed from prison tomorrow after serving four years of a ten-year sentence for a burglary which resulted in the death of a NYPD officer . Crime Scene: Police investigate the crime scene in the Bronx, N.Y., Saturday, Dec. 10, 2005, where off-duty NYPD officer, Daniel Enchautegui, 28, was shot in the chest before dawn . Outraged: Yolanda Rosa, the sister of slain New York Police Officer Daniel Enchautegui, (right) has spoken out on the early release of Lillo Brancato the Sopranos actor who was involved in the tragic death of her brother . Yolanda Rosa, the sister of Enchautegui said that she was notified only on Tuesday that Brancato would be released on Wednesday - after being granted parole earlier in the month. 'I’m still upset that he was not convicted of the murder, and that he did not serve enough time,' Yolanda Rosa said to the New York Post. 'I don’t know how I will feel tomorrow when he is free, walking on the streets, while my brother will not.' Authorities told Rosa that Brancato had been a model prisoner behind bars, a suggestion she scoffed at. 'Well, he wasn't a model citizen before — we’ll see if he’s a model citizen after he gets out,' she added. Speaking to the New York Daily News, Rosa expressed her disbelief that the once-promising young actor would be released so soon. 'He didn’t serve enough time. He was equally as responsible as the other guy,' Rosa said. 'Not a day goes by that I don’t think about my brother.' Announcement: Lillo Brancato took to Twitter from prison to announce that he was being released from jail on December 31 . Grief: Police Officer Daniel Enchautegui's father Pedro Enchautegui (3rd L) is consoled by a police officer as others prepare to carry his casket out of St. John's Chrysostom Church after his funeral mass in New York December 14, 2005 . In their case, prosecutors said that in December 2005, Brancato and Steven Armento broke into the Bronx apartment of a friend looking to steal prescription drugs after a night of drinking at a strip club. Officer Enchautegui heard the commotion next door from his apartment and went to investigate. Armento shot the 28-year-old officer with the .357 Magnum he was carrying in the heart and the dying officer fired back shooting both men. As a result of the death of an officer, Brancato was charged with second-degree murder - but was only convicted of burglary in 2008 and was sentenced to serve 10 years and five-years probation in 2009. Armento was sentenced to life in prison without parole after being found guilty of first-degree murder. In a statement Monday, PBA President Patrick J. Lynch said he believed Brancato was guilty in the officer’s death. 'It is our firm belief that Lillo Brancato is guilty of the murder of police officer Daniel Enchautequi even though he was only convicted of attempted burglary. 'Even while incarcerated, this lowlife thug showed his true colors when he beat up a fellow inmate who wouldn’t get off a pay phone quickly enough,' Lynch said in the statement. Promising: Lillo Brancato with Robert De Niro as they film Bronx Tale in 1993 . Patrolmen’s Benevolent Association trustee Joe Anthony said he was outraged by the decision by the parole board. 'I sat in the courtroom everyday with the family while that smug punk smiled and laughed at them,' he said. 'I hope someone taught him respect in prison.' Brancato, who was allowed to maintain a Twitter account while serving his sentence posted a message of thanks online to all his supporters. 'With that being said, this will be my last tweet from prison. Thank you for your love and support. I love you all!' he tweeted to his 3,364 followers. Brancato rose to fame in the 1993 movie A Bronx Tale, playing a young kid from the neighborhood who is torn between two worlds and two men: a local mobster played by Chazz Palminteri and his straight-and-narrow bus-driver father, played by Robert De Niro. Other roles followed, most notably a stint on the second season of The Sopranos. His character carried out a series of low-level crimes for the New Jersey mob before being gunned down by Tony Soprano and his sidekick as he tearfully begged for his life. HBO hit : Lillo Brancato appears in the seminal mob drama The Sopranos in the early years of the 2000s . Brancato, now 36, and Armento, 51 , were drinking together at a strip club in December 2005 before deciding to break into the basement apartment in a hunt for Valium, prosecutors said during the 2008 trial. Brancato testified during the trial there was a never a break-in. He claimed that he had known the owner, a Vietnam veteran, for several years. He also said he had permission to go inside and take painkillers and other pills whenever he felt like it, and didn't know the man had died earlier that year. The pills were part of a drug problem that he said began when he was 'introduced to marijuana' on the set of A Bronx Tale. He later became hooked on crack and heroin, he said. He told the jury that while suffering from judgment-impairing heroin withdrawals on the night of the shooting, he accidentally broke the kitchen window of the apartment in a desperate attempt to wake up his old pill-supplier. 'I was becoming dope sick,' Brancato testified. 'Mentally, I was a mess.' Brancato tried to deflect suggestions by the prosecution that his testimony — at times punctuated by vignettes about his drug-crazed downfall — was another acting job.","Lillo Brancato was jailed for ten years in 2009 for a burglary which resulted in the death of NYPD officer Daniel Enchautegui .

The drone in the video which is produced by Mr Cornell, a designer and co-founder and creative director of San Francisco-based firm Firespotter Labs, is able to read information about the city far below, including the number of cars and people on Golden Gate Bridge at any given time. ‘In the near future, cities use semi-autonomous drones for urban security. Human officers monitor drone feeds remotely, and data reports are displayed with a detailed HUD (heads up display) and communicated via a simulated human voice (designed to mitigate discomfort with sentient drone technology),’ he explained on YouTube. ‘While the drones operate independently, they are “guided"" by the human monitors, who can suggest alternate mission plans and ask questions,’ he said.

Over half a million guns are stolen in the U.S. every year and anecdotal evidence suggests that a lot of killings are the result of people using stolen weapons or guns borrowed from family members. Now researchers are looking into ways to add radio frequency identification (RFID) chips into guns so that they can only shoot when they are fired by their owner. While there are no immediate plans to introduce the technology, one expert believes it could prevent unnecessary loss of life. RFID chips could be used in guns to clamp down on the use of weapons by anyone other than their owners, who would need an accompanying RFID chip fitted to fire the weapon . Radio-frequency identification (RFID) is the wireless non-contact use of radio-frequency electromagnetic fields to transfer data, for the purposes of automatically identifying and tracking tags attached to objects. RFID tags are used to track animals and are inserted beneath their skin. The anti-theft hard plastic tags attached to merchandise in stores use the technology. RFID tags are used to check baggage in airports and identify trees. They are embedded in credit cards and Oyster transport cards so users can make payments by touching an electronic reader. The idea of using RFID chips in guns is not new and is a relatively cheap way of clamping down on the use of guns by anyone other than their owners. The person firing the gun would need an accompanying RFID chip fitted inside their hand or carried on their person to fire a weapon fitted with a linked RFID tag. Jim Handy, a semiconductor industry analyst said an RFID tag can be surgically implanted into a person’s hand to override a lock on the gun. Writing in a Forbes blog, he said he first came across the idea in 2005 but while the tags are small and relatively unnoticeable once implanted, they will eventually become obsolete and can move around the body, meaning a person firing a gun might have to hold it in a particular way. A semiconductor industry analyst said an RFID tag (pictured) could be surgically implanted into a person's hand or embedded in a ring or bracelet to override a lock on a smart gun . Some guns have biometric sensors to read an individual's fingerprint or grip, but the technology takes a few seconds to verify an individual . However, the chip could additionally be embedded into a . ring or bracelet, known as a key. While not as secure as an implant, this would still make the . firing of a stolen weapon much more difficult if the key isn't in very close proximity. According to Mr Handy, RFID chips cost less than ten cents (six pence) each and the electronics used in the reader costs less than a dollar or 61 pence. Mr Handy believes the RFID approach is superior to adding biometric sensors to guns as that technology takes a few seconds to verify a fingerprint or grip, leading gun owners to argue that delay could cost them their lives. He pointed out that it is not rare for a killer to murder a police officer with another officer’s gun, or for school children to steal a parent’s weapon, while stolen firearms are often used in gang violence. A U.S. Department of Justice survey found 37 per cent of prison inmates used a family member’s gun and 40 per cent got their gun from an illegal source and Mr Handy thinks that RFID technology could reduce the number of guns stolen or borrowed. The state of New Jersey passed a law in 2002 that requires gun shops to only sell smart guns within three years of them becoming available. However, some gun owners worry that the technology could be tampered with by anti-gun outsiders and affect their ability to bear arms, while others worry it could undermine the reliability of their weapon. A gun fitted with biometric sensors is used in the latest James Bond film, Skyfall, where one of Bond's rivals tries to use the British secret agent's gun, but fails. Some people who are not in favour of the technology being used for weapons argue the time it takes to identify their fingerprint could cost them their lives .","Scientists are researching using radio frequency identification (RFID) chips in guns to prevent people firing stolen or borrowed weapons .

Some lucky Brits could be in for a white Christmas this year, according to new predictions from the Met Office. Forecasters said people in Wales, Scotland and high areas elsewhere in the country could be greeted by snowflakes on Christmas morning. The Met Office's technical definition of a white Christmas only requires one snowflake to fall anywhere in the country, making it very likely that this year will fit the bill. According to the Met Office, heavy rain will pass late on Christmas Eve to make way for snowfall across the UK . Parts of the UK, including the Yorkshire Dales, already have a light coating of snow that will thicken . Only 14 years of the past 52 have failed to produce snow somewhere in the UK. And in 2014, northern areas higher than 200m above sea level, and southern areas above 400m are likely to be in line for a light dusting. And bright and mild weather is likely to greet the rest of us on Christmas Day, after blustery lead-up. Analysts said that there will be 'pleasant' conditions with highs of 6 degrees centigrade in the north and 8 degrees in the north of the country. Helen Roberts, a forecaster with the Met Office, said: 'Snow could fall above a couple of hundred metres in the north and 400m in the south. 'There won’t be widespread snow but it will be largely over hills and higher ground.' 'The official definition of a white Christmas is just one snowflake falling in that 24-hour period. Most people think of a white Christmas as seeing a little bit more than that, though. Travellers are warned to take care when driving over the Christmas period as temperatures plummet . A white Christmas is technically when one snowflake falls, which has happened 38 Christmases in the last 52 years. Widespread snow has only occurred four times in the same time period . 'For a lot of the UK it’ll be a fairly decent day, with some sunshine,  lighter winds than the previous few days – feeling a little bit more pleasant, though it will be quite chilly – between 4 and 6 degrees in the north and 5 and 8 degrees in the south.' 'There will be showers, but largely towards western parts of the UK, in Scotland, Wales and south-west England. 'Places like the Welsh hills and mountains could see a bit of snow, as could the Pennines and the mountains in Scotland.' According to the Sunday Express, bookmakers Ladbrokes have now cut their odds for snow falling in London on Christmas Day from 12/1 to 8/1. Odds for Edinburgh and Glasgow are 3/1, with Manchester at 4/1, Leeds at 6/1 and Cardiff and Birmingham at 8/1. A spokesman said: “Punters had given up all hope of a White Christmas but the latest news has seen a flurry of bets for a festive snowfall on December 25th.' While most dream of gardens blanketed with crisp, white snow, the Met Office says the definition is of a single snowflake falling in the 24 hours of December 25. But we are often left disappointed as climate history shows wintry weather is more likely between January and March. Snow or sleet falls on average five days in December, compared to 7.6 days in January, 6.8 days in February and six days in March. But we can remain optimistic as at least one snowflake has fallen on 38 Christmases in the last 52 years. Snow lying on the ground on Christmas Day is much rarer. White Christmases were more frequent in the 18th and 19th centuries, according to the Met Office. The change of calendar in 1752, which effectively brought Christmas Day back by 12 days, also minimised the chances. Climate change has also brought higher average temperatures over land and sea, which generally reduces the probability of a white Christmas. But experts claim that will not make them less likely in the future.","Forecaster says high places across the UK could experience snow .

Cubans awoke on Friday for the first time in half a century with the right to buy new and used vehicles from the state without special permission, but markups of 400 percent or more quickly dashed most people's expectations. At the state-run Peugeot dealership in Havana on Friday morning, where prices ranged from $91,000 for a 2013 model 206 to $262,000 for a 508, people walked away shaking their heads in disgust. 'I earn 600 Cuban pesos per month (approximately $30). That means in my whole life I can't buy one of these. I am going to die before I can buy a new car,'  Roberto Gonzales, a state driver, said, walking back to his 1950s Plymouth. Scroll down for video .

The average monthly wage in Cuba, where four out of five of the 5 million-strong labor force work for the state, is $20. A European diplomat quipped, 'I am slightly flabbergasted. With these prices, the old-time U.S. cars will not disappear fast from the streets.' Under a reform two years ago, Cubans can now buy and sell used cars from each other, but until Friday had to request authorization from the government to purchase a new vehicle or second-hand one, usually a rental car, from state retailers. Before September 2011, only automobiles that were in Cuba before the 1959 revolution could be freely bought and sold, which is why there are so many 1950s or older cars, most of them American-made, rumbling through Cuban streets. Along with Cuba's famous rolling museum of vintage U.S. cars, there are also many Soviet-made cars, dating from the era when the Soviet Union was the island's biggest ally and benefactor.

This car once was for sale for $5,000 dollars, but the price has risen to as much as $30,000, after a new law has greatly restricted vehicle ownership in the country . Newer models are largely in government hands and were sold used before Friday at a relatively low price to select individuals, for example, Cuban diplomats, doctors and teachers who served abroad. Across town from the Peugeot dealership, where more than a hundred used rent-a-cars went on sale for prices ranging as a rule from $25,000 on up, disgust turned to anger on Friday. 'These prices show a lack of respect for all Cubans. What is here are wrecks. I now have no hope of getting a car for my family,' artist Cesar Perez said, looking at a 2005 Renault on sale for the equivalent of $25,000 and available outside the country on the Internet for $3,000. A teacher looked at the price list and yelled 'Are there any bicycles?' as she stomped away without giving her name. The Cuban state maintains a monopoly on the retail sale of cars. There are 650,000 autos on the island, half of them owned by the government. A vintage automobile drives by a parking lot of modern vehicles in Havana, Cuba . Price list of new and used foreign-made cars for sale at a car dealer in Havana . The decades-old ban on importing cars and need for state permission to purchase from the state has left nine out of 10 Cuban households without a car or other vehicle such as a motorcycle and dependent on the decrepit public transportation system. The cost of new and used cars sold by Cubans to each other is similar to those that went on sale on Friday because of limited availability. The government said all profits would go into a special fund to upgrade public transportation. Diplomats, foreign businesses and select Cubans will still need government permission to import a new or used car without the huge markup. The liberalizing of car sales was one of more than 300 reforms put forth by President Raul Castro, who took over for his ailing brother Fidel in 2008, and approved in 2011 at a congress of the Communist Party, Cuba's only legal political party. The proposed changes put a greater emphasis on private initiative, which had been largely stifled under Cuba's Soviet-style system, and less government control over the sale and purchase of personal property such as homes and cars.

In essence, they represent a luxury tax imposed by the government on the nouveau riches of Cuba,' John Kirk, one of Canada's leading academic experts on Latin America and author of a number of books on Cuba, said by email. There are now tens of thousands of small private businesses in Cuba, and thousands of farm, construction, transportation and other types of cooperatives, all of which in theory should benefit from the opening up of car sales. Bert Hoffmann, a Cuba expert at the German Institute of Global and Area Studies in Hamburg said in an email that many businesses needed vehicles, but such high prices would make it difficult for most and cut into other business activity, stalling their overall development.

Now, the 31-year-old survivor is in a bitter dispute to keep his condominium in Southern California, and has turned to an unlikely place - the Occupy Los Angeles movement - for help. Scroll down to watch video . A student who was critically wounded at Columbine High School nearly 13 years ago is now facing foreclosure on his home. Dispute: Richard Castaldo, 31, was shot and paralyzed from the chest down during the horrific Columbine massacre on the morning of April 20, 1999. Now, he's in a bitter dispute to keep his condominium in Southern California . Confined: Mr Castaldo is now confined to a wheelchair . Injury: Mr Castaldo was hit with eight separate bullets, one of which lodged in his spine shown here . Around 11:20am that morning, Mr Castaldo and his friend Rachel Scott were sitting outside of Columbine High School in Littleton, Colorado eating lunch together near the west entrance of the school when two of their fellow students, Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, opened fire on them. Mr Castaldo was hit with eight separate bullets, one of which lodged in his spine, paralyzing him from the chest down. Ms Scott was shot four times, once in the head, and died instantly. In total, 12 students and one teacher were killed in the Columbine shootings, and 21 students – including Mr Castaldo – were injured. Both Harris and Klebold committed suicide following the shootings. The family of Mr Castaldo filed lawsuits in August of 2000 against the parents of Harris and Klebold as well as those who sold guns to the killers. The families of several other victims were also part of the lawsuit. Loss: On the morning of the Columbine shootings, Mr Castaldo and his friend Rachel Scott (pictured) were sitting outside of Columbine High School in Littleton, Colorado eating lunch together near the west entrance of the school when two of their fellow students, Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, opened fire on them . Mourning: Ms Scott was shot four times, once in the head, and died instantly . Aftermath: In total, 12 students and one teacher were killed in the Columbine shootings, and 21 students ¿ including Mr Castaldo ¿ were injured . After a bitter legal dispute lasting more than a year, Mr Castaldo and around 30 other victims' families received a collective $2.85million settlement. It remains unclear how much of that settlement Mr Castaldo and his family received. Survivor: Mr Castaldo is all smiles as he listened to President Bill Clinton make a speech during a groundbreaking ceremony in Clement Park not far from Columbine High School in 2006 . The massacre survivor moved to Los Angeles to pursue a career in music after a lengthy stay at the hospital, according to NBC Los Angeles. During his recovery, he even received a phone call from then-president Bill Clinton wishing him a speedy recovery. Mr Castaldo purchased a condo at the Hollywood Regis in 2008, thinking the Southern California property to be a wise investment. But as was the case for millions of other Americans lured into the housing bubble, the value depreciated, and Mr Castaldo was in serious financial trouble. He started to fall behind on payments in February. ‘I feel kind of stupid, honestly, because I should have known better,’ he told NBC Los Angeles. He told the news station that though he received offers to help, every solicitor demanded that the money be paid up front. Mr Castaldo was running out of options, with his foreclosed condo is up for auction next month. And so, the Columbine survivor turned to an unlikely source – Occupy Los Angeles, part of the greater Occupy movement – for help. ‘I feel like they’re really the only group that doesn’t have an ulterior motive,’ he said of the group, which was itself evicted from Los Angeles’ City Hall.

Pinned under a car with the weight of the engine on his shoulders, it’s remarkable enough that he’s managing to smile. More remarkable still, however, is the fact that Justin Futers escaped this perilous situation unscathed, save for a few cuts and bruises. The 47-year-old cyclist was dragged beneath the blue Chevrolet as he pulled out of a junction in Worthing, West Sussex. Trapped: Justin Futers, 47, was stuck under this car for 30 minutes after it ran him down on the road . Accident scene: Mr Futers can be seen under the front wheels of the car, while his mangled bike lies nearby . He came within millimetres of being . crushed by the front wheels and was trapped for half an hour before . emergency services finally freed him. Mr . Futers, a painter and decorator, from Littlehampton, West Sussex, said: . ‘My head and my face were scraping the tarmac so it was pretty close. 'I . didn’t shut my eyes and think, “this is it”, although it could have . been.’ 'The weight of the engine was right over my shoulders, there was a quarter of an inch between me and the rest of the car, it was that tight.' Mr Futers hopes these shocking images of his ordeal will be a warning to all road users to take extra care. A former paramedic trainer, an ex-firefighter and an off-duty police officer were all among passers-by who came to his aid. Emergency services arrived a short while later and took control of the rescue operation. Mr . Futers, from Littlehampton, West Sussex, was released and taken to . Worthing Hospital where he learned he had escaped with no broken bones. Rescue operation: Firemen were able to remove Mr Futers from under the car, and discovered he was remarkably uninjured . Recovery: After being rescued from under the car, Mr Futers went to hospital and was told he had not broken any bones . He says he has not fully considered the psychological impact of the crash but vows to be back on his bike within a month. He said: 'I can't remember what I was thinking at the time other than ""There is a car on top of me"".' Witness Mike Brampton, 53, who took the photos, said: 'It is a miracle the cyclist survived let alone escaped with no broken bones. 'As I approached the car all I could see underneath was a figure dressed in red, and I feared the worst. 'I was relieved that he could speak.

It has been 15 years since those Birds of a Feather disappeared from our screens. But it seems the lives of Sharon, Tracey and Dorien have lost little of their appeal. The comeback episode of the Essex-based comedy drew an average of 7.8million viewers, peaking with an audience of 8.3million. Essex girls: The returning cast of Birds of a Feather (L-R) Pauline Quirke as Sharon, Linda Robson as Tracey and Lesley Joseph as Dorien . Critics initially suggested that the comedy, which was nominated for a Bafta award in 1993, would not translate to a modern audience when it was revealed that ITV were planning to bring it back. At the height of its popularity in the 1990s, the programme pulled in 27million viewers. However, delighted fans took to Twitter to praise the new series. Alex Cheney wrote: ‘I might just have watched the new episode of Birds of a Feather for the fourth time in under 24 hours. It is so good to have it back!’ Another added: ‘Loved Birds of a Feather last night. Used to watch it all the time. So funny!’ The girls are back in town - Chigwell, to be precise: The comedy ensemble were a nostalgic hit with Twitter fans . Blast from the past: The show's new incarnation even featured the old credits . The comedy, created by Laurence Marks and Maurice Gran, first aired 25 years ago, and ran until 1998 when it was axed by the BBC after more than 100 episodes. The new series was originally offered to the BBC, who turned it down. It will now run for a further seven episodes. Its audience matched the 7.8million who watched the EastEnders special on Christmas Day, and it was marginally less than the 8.3million average audience who tuned in to the Christmas Day episode of Doctor Who. Golden Girls: The trio were a ratings success back in the 1990s . The figures for the season opener include viewers who watched the show on ITV+1. Without catch-up figures, the show, which aired at 8.30pm on Thursday, still managed to draw an average audience figure of 6.8million. The new series features original cast members Pauline Quirke, 54, and Linda Robson, 55, as sisters Sharon and Tracey. Lesley Joseph, 68, also returns as the pair’s man-eater neighbour Dorien, who now writes erotic fiction.

The soldier accused of killing 16 villagers in a nighttime rampage in Afghanistan returned to his base wearing a cape and with the blood of his victims on his rifle, belt, shirt and pants, a military prosecutor said Monday. Staff Sgt. Robert Bales was incredulous when fellow U.S. soldiers drew their weapons on him when he returned to Camp Belambay in southern Afghanistan last March, prosecutor Lt. Col. Jay Morse said as a preliminary hearing opened at Joint Base Lewis-McChord, Washington. Bales then turned to one sergeant at the scene and said: 'Mac, if you rat me out...' Morse said. A courtroom sketch of Staff Sgt. Robert Bales, third from left, during his hearing last month . Robert Bales is charged with 16 counts of premeditated murder and six counts of attempted murder . Bales, 39, has been charged with 16 counts of premeditated murder and six counts of attempted murder in one of the worst atrocities of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars. Nine of the victims were children. The hearing will help determine whether the case goes to a court martial. Bales has not entered a plea. His attorneys have not discussed the evidence in the case, but say Bales has PTSD and suffered a concussive head injury during a prior deployment to Iraq. The father of two from Lake Tapps, Wash., sat beside one of his civilian lawyers, Emma Scanlan, in green fatigues as an investigating officer read the charges against Bales and informed him of his rights. Bales said, 'Sir, yes, sir,' when asked if he understood them. Morse said Bales seemed utterly normal in the hours before the March 11 killings. With his colleagues, Bales watched the movie 'Man on Fire,' a fictional account of a former CIA operative on a revenge rampage. Just before he left the base, Morse said, Bales told a Special Forces soldier that he was unhappy with his family life, and that the troops should have been quicker to retaliate for a roadside bomb attack that claimed one soldier's leg. 'At all times he had a clear understanding of what he was doing and what he had done,' said Morse, who described Bales as lucid, coherent and responsive. Bales is accused of slipping away from the remote outpost with an M-4 rifle outfitted with a grenade launcher to attack the villages of Balandi and Alkozai, in a dangerous district. American officials have said they believe Bales broke the slaughter into two episodes - walking first to one village, returning to the base and slipping away again to carry out the second attack. The prosecutor said Bales returned to the base at one point, telling a colleague about shooting people at a village. The soldier apparently took it as a bad joke and responded: 'Quit messing around.' Bales' hearing is taking place in a military courtroom on Joint Base Lewis McChord in Washington state . The defense team for Bales, second from left in this courtroom sketch, are preparing for his case to go to court martial . Innocent: Kari Bales told ABC News last month: 'My husband did not do this. I truly believe from the bottom of my heart that my husband is not involved' Prosecutors played for the first time a video captured by a surveillance blimp that showed a caped figure running toward the base, then stopping and dropping his weapons as he's confronted. There is no audio. Morse said Bales was the caped figure. After being taken into custody, Morse said, Bales said: 'I thought I was doing the right thing.' The hearing is scheduled to run as long as two weeks, and part of it will be held overnight to allow video testimony from witnesses, including an estimated 10 to 15 Afghans, in Afghanistan. Bales' attorney, John Henry Browne, said the hearing will give the defense a chance to see what the government can prove. They are expecting a court martial. Bales is an Ohio native who joined the Army in late 2001 - after the 9/11 attacks - as his career as a stockbroker imploded. An arbitrator entered a $1.5 million fraud judgment against him and his former company that went unpaid, and his attempt to start an investment firm in Florida also failed. He was serving his fourth combat tour after three stints in Iraq, and his arrest prompted a national discussion about the stresses posed by multiple deployments. Scanlan, his attorney, declined to say to what extent the lawyers hope to elicit testimony that could be used to support a mental-health defense. Bales himself will not make any statements because his lawyers said he would have nothing to gain. Bodies of Afghan civilians, allegedly shot by US soldier Staff Sergeant Robert Bales, loaded into the back of a van in Alkozai village of Panjwayi district, Kandahar province . Man on Fire: The movie Bales watched with colleagues before allegedly carrying out 16 counts of premeditated murder and six counts of attempted murder . Bales' wife, Kari, who plans to attend the hearing, had complained about financial problems on her blog in the year before the killings, and noted Bales was disappointed at being passed over for a promotion. Browne described those stresses as garden-variety - nothing that would prompt such a massacre - and has also said, without elaborating, that Bales suffered a traumatic incident during his second Iraq tour that triggered 'tremendous depression.' Bales remembers little or nothing from the time of the attacks, the defense said. Scanlan, who deferred an opportunity to give an opening statement, said the Army had only recently turned over a preliminary DNA trace evidence report from the crime scenes, but defense experts have not had time to review it. Bales, who spent months in confinement at Fort Leavenworth, Kan., before being transferred to Lewis-McChord last month, is doing well, Scanlan said. Kari Bales maintains that her husband is innocent and was not responsible for the senseless slayings. Speaking to ABC News on Sunday, she said she finds it 'incomprehensible' that her husband and best friend, 'Bob,' faces 16 charges of premeditated murder. 'It doesn't seem possible. Especially that there were women and children,' she said. 'My heart goes out to those families that lost loved ones, parents and grandparents. I am a mom; I can't imagine losing my child, especially to something like that.' Ms Bales said she learned of the . attack within hours from military officials and her initial reaction was . that 'it must have been a mistake.' 'It . certainly wasn't, it wasn't my husband,' she said. 'I know my husband. I know . him very well, and especially the talk about the women and the children. I knew that it wasn't my husband.

Bales will not make any statements in court because his lawyers said he would have nothing to gain . 'He was like, 'What? What you talking about?' He had, he knew that something was going on, but did not know the extent of what was going on, and I was actually the one that had told him how many people had died, and that included women and children, and he was blown away.

'Chaos and confusion': The figures were obtained . by Liz Kendall, pictured, Labour MP for Leicester, who blamed the Government's . costly shake up of the NHS . NHS spending on management consultants has risen three-fold in a year. In the past six months, £40million has been paid out by various health service organisations, compared to £15million for the whole of last year. This includes £17.6million paid out by 211 new GP-led organisations called Clinical Commissioning Groups who decide how to spend local NHS budgets. And another £10million was spent by 18 new quangos called Clinical Support Units who advise these GP organisations on what treatments and services to buy. The hospital watchdog Monitor paid out £8.5million, while NHS England – the body in charge of running the health service – spent £1.8million. Labour MP Liz Kendall, who obtained the figures, blamed the Government’s costly shake-up of the NHS. Last April, ministers scrapped hundreds of Primary Care Trusts and Strategic Health Authorities and replaced them with CCGs in the hope of cutting management and bureaucracy. Mrs Kendall said: ‘Patients left waiting hours in A&E, and hard-pressed taxpayers who are struggling to make ends meet, will be rightly furious at the huge increase in spending on management consultants. ‘David Cameron’s backroom NHS reorganisation has caused utter chaos and confusion. All these new bodies are now desperately trying to figure out what they are supposed to be doing, and paying millions of pounds to management consultants to advise them.’ Figures also show that the NHS spent £1.4billion in redundancy payments during the shake-up. Only last month it emerged that 3,200 . bureaucrats had been given pay-offs, only to walk into new jobs within . the health service. They include a husband-and-wife team who took . £1million in redundancies. Hundreds of Primary Care . Trusts and Strategic Health Authorities have been replaced with 211 new .

Nike, which sponsors the England football team and may of the country's top players including Wayne Rooney, Danny Welbeck and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, claims the move aimed to cut costs and improve consumer experience.

A primary school adding an extra week to its October half-term holiday so Asian families can take their  children abroad when temperatures are cooler there. The Church of England academy has announced it will be breaking up for a fortnight – instead of the usual week – during the  autumn term following requests from parents. Wensley Fold Primary School in Blackburn has around 300 pupils, a high proportion of whom come from Asian backgrounds. The school, which until now has had a week off for the October half-term, said the changes would be introduced as a trial for the new school year in September. Changes: Wensley Fold Primary School, pictured, has extended the October half-term break from one to two weeks to allow families to visit relatives abroad. The latest Ofsted figures reveal 85 per cent of pupils at the school are from minority ethnic groups . A statement on the school's website said the extra five days off would be made up at the start of the school year. The latest Ofsted figures, from an inspection in 2006, show the school has an above average number of pupils from minority ethnic groups, with 85 per cent of pupils not speaking English as their first language. That number was up from the 2001 inspection when 66 per cent of pupils were found to have English as an additional language. There are currently 304 children on the school roll. The new two-week autumn break at Wensley Fold Primary comes shortly after the government announced more freedom to allow headteachers set term dates. In a letter a letter to parents, the governing body said the changes were being made in response to requests from families to visit their relatives abroad. One parent, who asked not to be named, said October was the best time to visit family in Pakistan due to the more reasonable temperatures. Temporary trial: A statement on the school's website, above, said the decision has been taken after 'many requests' from parents to take their children out of school to visit relatives abroad. The school says the changes, which will be brought into effect at the start of the next school year, will be trialled for 'one year initially' Average daily temperatures in the capital Islamabad can reach 33C in the height of summer. A letter to parents, published on the school's website, said: 'In light of the changes by the government to holidays in school time and the many requests we have from parents to take children out of school to visit relations overseas, the governors have decided to review the school holiday pattern 2014-2015. 'In October 2014 the school will close for two weeks from October 20 until October 31, instead of the usual one week closure. 'The five days will be made up at the beginning of the school year and we will of course, have to comply with the regulatory school openings. 'We are giving all parents as much notice as possible to book flights. 'The governors have decided that this will be a trial for one year initially and we would welcome feedback from parents in the future.' The changes in the government’s .

An unremarkable porcelain dish valued at £70 has sold for £84,000 after it was found to be from the court of King Louis XV. It is believed the 13.5-inch French plate was displayed in a cabinet by its elderly owner who knew nothing of its royal history and thought it was of little worth. Even the auctioneers initially failed to spot the 260-year-old plate's heritage, saying it would fetch just £70. This unremarkable porcelain dish valued at £70 has sold for £84,000 after it was found to be from the court of King Louis XV . But closer inspection revealed it was from a collection of around 1,700 items made for the king and held at the Palace of Versailles. A bidding frenzy saw the price rocket to 1,200 times the estimate as the plate, which dates back to 1753, was snapped up by a French antiques dealer. The plate was part of a set made by master goldsmith Jean-Claude Duplessis between 1753 and 1755 at the Royal factory in Vincennes. Louis XV, who ruled France from 1715 until his death in 1774, paid 87,272 French livres for the set - around £6,500 in today's money. Louis XV, who ruled France from 1715 until his death in 1774, paid 87,272 French livres for the set - around £6,500 in today's money . Jane Brown, from Wellers Auctions in Guildford, Surrey, said: 'Very little is known about the plate's history before it came to us. 'It was inherited from a deceased elderly relative who we think just kept it in her china cabinet thinking it was a pretty plate but not realising its true value. 'We missed it at the cataloguing stage and so it initially had an estimate of £70. 'After that, it went into a store room until we were ready to put it on display closer to the auction date. 'However by the time it went on view, we had a second look and realised what the plate really was. 'We got some second opinions from experts and they confirmed it was from the Louis XV service. It was just one of those auction miracles. 'There was a lot of demand for the plate and bidding was going up in increments of £5,000. 'A similar plate sold recently for £50,000 so there were smiles all round when ours sold for even more.' Although the hammer price for the blue and white plate was £70,000, with all the fees added on, the overall price paid for it was £84,000. Louis XV ascended the throne in 1715 at the tender age of five following the death of his great grandfather Louis XIV. His cousin Philippe II, the Duke of Orleans, ruled as Regent until Louis was 13 and considered mature enough to take over. Louis XV was ruler of France until he died from smallpox aged 64 in 1774.

The widow of a church organist murdered on the way to church a year ago has spoken movingly about how she has forgiven his killers. Maureen Greaves, 64, said she would not describe the two men convicted of the motiveless attack on husband Alan, 68, as ‘evil’ and her strong Christian faith had enabled her to extend to them ‘real and true forgiveness’. Rather than rage or anger, the shocking crime has left Mrs Greaves with a ‘very deep bewilderment’.She said she was left asking herself: ‘How did this happen? How could anybody just walk down a road and be murdered like this?’ Maureen Greaves has said she will keep on forgiving the men responsible for killing her husband, Alan, on Christmas Eve 2012 . Mr Greaves, a father of four and grandfather, was beaten with a pickaxe by strangers while walking to play at Midnight Mass at his local church in Sheffield on Christmas Eve 2012. He died in hospital three days later. Last July, Jonathan Bowling, 22, was sentenced to life for his murder and Ashley Foster, 22, jailed for nine years for manslaughter. They were out looking for trouble when they set upon Mr Greaves, Sheffield Crown Court was told. Speaking to Radio 4’s Today programme, Mrs Greaves said that at the sentencing hearing, ‘I looked across at them and I kind of found myself thinking, “why am I forgiving these people? 'They have taken from me the person I . loved most in the world and they have taken from me the person who . loved me the most in the world”.’ Mrs Greaves broke down in tears at a candelit service attended by 300 people on the anniversary of her husband's death . The 64-year-old said the men convicted 'needed to face the consequences' of what they had done to her husband, a church organist . But she said it wasn’t long before she was praying to God for the ability to ‘keep on forgiving them’. Mrs Greaves broke down in tears at a . candlelit service attended by 300 people on the anniversary of and at . the same spot as the attack. However, she spoke calmly and in detail about her feelings towards the killers in the radio interview.She said that despite her forgiveness, she had always ‘wanted justice for Alan’. She said: ‘For me these two men did a very evil act, although I don’t want to call them evil men because I don’t know them. ‘They needed to face the consequences of what they did.’ Mrs Greaves said she had received a letter from Bowling and had replied simply by saying, ‘I have read your letter and thank you for it.’ The judge said Bowling would serve a . minimum of 25 years before being considered for release. Mrs Greaves . said this was ‘a just punishment’. The wedding of her daughter Emma made the anniversary of Alan's death more manageable, said Mrs Greaves . Seeing her husband's wedding ring being placed on her daughter's finger at her wedding last year was an 'emotional' experience she said . She said her family was disappointed by Foster’s nine-year term for the lesser offence but were comforted by the fact he would be ‘recognised’ after his release because of the high-profile nature of the crime he committed. Mrs Greaves said the anniversary was made easier by the marriage of her daughter Emma, 38, to David Marshall, 40, on December 28. Emma wore her father’s ring as her wedding ring. ‘On the day of the wedding it was very emotional for me to see the ring being put on her finger,’ said Mrs Greaves.","Alan Greaves was murdered by two strangers on Christmas Eve 2012 .

Ed Miliband's barrister wife is representing a wind farm company in a case which campaigners say could open the way to vast turbines blighting historic sites. Justine Thornton, who specialises in environmental law, is advising Barnwell Manor Wind Energy in its bid to build four 400ft turbines on land owned by the Duke of Gloucester. The plan had been rejected on the grounds it would overshadow a Tudor summer house set in what a planning inspector called Britain’s finest Elizabethan garden, with ‘national if not international significance’. But the Labour leader’s wife is helping the firm bring an appeal case against the National Trust, English Heritage and East Northamptonshire Council, which jointly secured a ruling against the wind farm at the High Court last March. The parties argued successfully that it would blight Lyveden New Bield, the Grade I-listed lodge and garden about half a mile away. Simon Thurley, chief executive of English Heritage, said: ‘The effect of the proposed turbines on one of the most important, beautiful and unspoilt Elizabethan landscapes in England would be appalling. This is why we pressed this case.’ However documents written by Miss Thornton and Gordon Nardell QC for the Court of Appeal case on January 23 claim the evidence for this was ‘less than substantial’. Mark Bradshaw, the local National Trust manager, said if the wind farm company won the appeal, it would make life easier for turbine developers to over-ride people’s concerns about other heritage sites. He said: ‘It will set a precedent which would be used for other applications that a 400ft object half a mile from Grade I-listed buildings is acceptable.’ The case has been fought for two years since the application was rejected by the local council, then overturned by a planning inspector who allowed it to meet green energy targets, despite admitting it would be ‘alien and incongruous’. The National Trust and English Heritage then defeated it at the High Court. The Trust billed it as ‘an important marker in the defence of the historic environment from inappropriate development’. The land is owned by the Queen’s cousin, the Duke of Gloucester, whose estate could make £120,000 a year in rental fees from the turbines. He is backing the energy firm, which says the project will provide clean electricity to more than 5,400 homes. Under-threat: The Grade I-listed Lyveden New Bield on which a wind farm would be built . The Duke, who lives in an apartment in Kensington Palace, is also patron of the Northamptonshire Museums and Historic Houses Forum which includes Lyveden New Bield. Lyveden was begun in the late 1500s by local sheriff Sir Thomas Tresham. It was left unfinished when he died in 1605. The National Trust discovered the remains of an Elizabethan pleasure garden in the grounds and restored its moats and orchards. Peter Stephens, chairman of the campaign group Stop Barnwell Manor Wind Farm, said: ‘It is hypocritical of the Duke to serve as patron of an organisation which seeks to protect our heritage while at the same time supporting a scheme which will damage it.’ A spokesman for Miss Thornton said: ‘Like all members of her profession, Justine Thornton is subject to the “cab rank rule” which stipulates that barristers act for anyone requesting their professional services.’","Justine Thornton is advising Barnwell Manor Wind Energy in bid to build four 400ft turbines on Grade I-listed land .

It seemed like an impossibly good deal. But when word spread about new iPads being sold at cut-price rates, dozens of buyers paid up in advance. Unfortunately, it was indeed too good to be true. Customers ended up £1.1million out of pocket after being tricked into believing businesswoman Kirsty Cox, 37, could deliver thousands of discounted tablets before Christmas. By the time the mother-of-two was arrested, a mob had gathered outside her house demanding the iPads they had paid for. Feelings were running so high she was kept in custody for her own safety. Yesterday, Cox wept as she was jailed for two years at Teesside Crown Court after admitting a £450,000 fraud. Passing sentence, Judge George Moorhouse said her actions had caused misery, especially to ‘young children who were expecting presents which never arrived’. Shaun Dodds, prosecuting, said Cox conned people into thinking she could provide iPads cheaply by claiming she had a number of legitimate sources. Buyers believed they would get £50 to £100 off the retail price. Cox told some people that a contact in the Armed Forces could source duty-free tablets from Dubai and others that a company she knew was selling them off cheaply as they had been on the shelves for 90 days. The 37-year-old told customers she could get her hands on cut-price iPads. After initially fulfilling orders, the word spread and Cox faced an influx of orders, which she failed to honour. By the time she was arrested in December 2012 crowds of angry customers had gathered outside her home . She took payment up front and was able . to fulfil initial orders. As word spread, impressed customers made . orders for friends, family and colleagues. The court heard Cox spent . £1.52million on full-price iPads at PC World, but had to sell them on at . a loss. As time went by, . she was unable to fulfil many orders and pressure mounted. Individual . victims lost between £400 and £232,000 in the scam between August and . December 2012. One . unidentified victim feared losing his businesses and home in the . fall-out, the court heard. A woman cancelled her own wedding to try to . pay back the people she had taken money from to give to Cox. Cox admitted four counts of fraud at Teesside Crown Court. Judge Moorhouse said her offending had caused 'misery' to many people in the run up to Christmas, leaving them without the presents they believed they had purchased for loved ones . Paul . Cleasby, defending, described her business model as ‘ludicrous and . frankly bizarre’ and claimed she made no money from the venture. ‘There . was no planning, there was no sophistication,’ he said. ‘It seems to . have been a snowball effect which quickly turned to an avalanche.’ Cox, described as a ‘well-presented’ woman, used her ‘niceness’ to win people’s trust. Her . business partner Neil Hathaway, who ran a successful communications . firm, said that she had also traded on his good name. The court heard . his company lost £40,000 as a result of the scam. ‘I am shocked by the . extent of the deception and I am hurt,’ he said. Cox, . of Newton Aycliffe, County Durham, told police she was unable to . deliver 4,000 iPads ordered by customers, saying: ‘I have made some . very, very, very bad business decisions.’ Mr Cleasby added: ‘There was no exit strategy.

David Cameron’s pledge to cut the cost of politics was in tatters last night after it emerged that the bill for the House of Lords has soared by £42million in the last three years. Some 103 additional peers have been created since 2010 – most of them Tories and Lib Dems – taking the total number to nearly 900. In addition, the amount that taxpayers have to fork out per unelected peer has surged by 17 per cent since the Coalition came to power. Cost: The bill for the House of Lords has soared by £42million in the last three years . Analysis by the House of Commons Library will further undermine respect for the Upper House, just weeks after it emerged that Lord Hanningfield had been ‘clocking in’ for short periods each day to claim his £300 allowance. The Tory peer said dozens of others did the same. The revelation about political waste comes on the day it emerged that the bill for the Government’s top spin doctors has risen almost four-fold in two decades. Salaries for politically-appointed special advisers now stand at £7.2million – up from £1.5million in the early 1990s. The Cameron-led Coalition had promised to save £12million a year by slashing the number of MPs from 650 to 600 but the plan was ditched following a bust-up between the two parties over House of Lords reforms . Despite election pledges to slash their number, there are now 98 so-called ‘spads’ working in Whitehall, up from 76 in 2010 under Labour. They earn an average of £73,470 each – more than a backbench MP. Details of the increased spending make a mockery of promises by both the Tories and Lib Dems to reduce the cost of politics. The Coalition had promised to save £12million a year by slashing the number of MPs from 650 to 600 but the plan was ditched following a bust-up between the two parties over House of Lords reforms. The amount of extra money spent on the Lords since 2010 is now more than three times what the Prime Minister hoped to save in the Commons. The latest figures show that the operating costs for each peer – which includes their daily allowance and staff wages – increased from £97,725 to £114,721 between 2010 and this year. Labour MP Tom Greatrex, who uncovered the data, said the Prime Minister’s commitment to reducing the cost of politics was a ‘sham’. The member for Rutherglen added: ‘David Cameron’s commitment to cutting the cost of politics is exposed as little more than a failed plan to get rid of democracy and replace it with an ever expanding unelected chumocracy of Lord Snooty’s pals.’ Jonathan Isaby of the TaxPayers’ Alliance called for reforms and said the Lords should not be ‘immune from the need to run itself cost effectively’.","103 additional peers since 2010 – most of them Tories and Lib Dems .

A teenage private schoolboy died after being hit by a taxi as he tried to get home from a New Year’s Eve party. Augustine Carnell was walking along a dual carriageway in Maidstone, Kent, when he was hit at around 3.30am on January 1. The 17-year-old, a pupil at the £16,600-a-year King’s School Rochester, had been to a party. It is believed the A-Level student was trying to get home. He was hit on the A229 in Maidstone, around six miles from his home in Rochester, and died at the scene. Police . confirmed he was hit by a white Skoda Rapid car and that the driver, . who was not arrested, had stopped immediately after the accident. One witness, calling himself RJT, said: 'I was a witness to this tragic accident. 'I immediately called 999 but a car was on the way down. I tried to flag him down but could not and witnessed the impact. 'I was in shock but still managed to check for a pulse and police were on site within 3 minutes. 'The car was a taxi and there is no question of him being hunted as he stopped and has been interviewed. I also have in car video footage of most of the incident although not the actual impact which is now with the police. 'My heart goes out to his family. I just wanted to clarify things and I am still shocked by what I witnessed that night.' Mr Carnell's family said he will live ‘forever in our hearts, our prayers and dreams’. In a statement, they said: ‘A kind, gentle, happy 17 year old boy full of fun and humour. He always made people feel welcome and at ease – a natural friend. He was a keen rugby player, both at King’s and Aylesford Bulls. He was a CCF Air Cadet and Explorer Scout with Shorne Scout Troup. ‘A qualified scuba diver, Mr Carnell completed a coral conservation diving project in 2012. He loved animals, our dogs, ducks, fish and his bearded dragon. ‘Augustine died tragically on Bluebell Hill after leaving a New Year’s Eve party; he was involved in a collision with a car and died instantly. ‘His family love him so very much. He is with Jesus now, but he will be with us forever in our hearts, our prayers and dreams. ‘Funeral arrangement details will be provided to his friends and family.’ Jeremy Walker, the headmaster of King’s School Rochester, called the incident 'devastating'. The school released a statement paying tribute to the ‘charismatic’ schoolboy. Scene of the crash: The A229 in Maidstone where the schoolboy was hit at around 3.30am on January 1 . ‘Augustine Carnell was a pupil at King’s Rochester from the age of four years old and his death is a very great loss to every member of the school. His vivacious personality, his ready smile, his positive presence in class and his many contributions to school life are just some of his qualities that we will all miss,' it said. ‘Augustine was an active member of the CCF, played rugby for the 1st XV and had completed his Bronze Duke of Edinburgh Award and Grade 5 on piano.  In addition he had many interests outside school including scuba-diving and the Scouts.  Last summer he took part in a coral reef conservation project in Florida where his commitment and humour made a great impression on his group. ‘Augustine . was a charismatic young man with a charming manner and a great sense of . fun.  His ability to relate to everyone he met, whether young or old, . meant that he had a wide circle of friends and was liked and respected . by all who had the privilege of knowing him. ‘Augustine . set a true example of how to live life to the full and will be deeply . missed and fondly remembered.  Our thoughts and prayers are very much . with his family and friends.’ The 17-year-old, a pupil at the King's School Rochester (pictured), had been to a party .

The owner of the mansion where Valerie Graves was murdered is understood to have been some 3,000 miles away when she was killed. But shocked businessman Malcolm Chamberlain, 66, has already spoken to detectives investigating the crime that took place while he was on holiday in Costa Rica and Miss Graves was house-sitting. Among subjects detectives may have touched on is a ‘swinging’ site for the sexually adventurous which until recently featured a profile of a man calling himself ‘Malcolm the highlander’ and illustrated with naked photographs apparently of Mr Chamberlain. Millionaire's life: Malcolm Chamberlain in one of the pictures on the website. He says he did not post the photographs . Lavish: The house on Smugglers Lane in Bosham which Miss Graves had been housesitting when she was murdered . It included an email address used by Mr Chamberlain and linked both to his home address in Bosham and his printing business in nearby Chichester. The person posting the profile urged fellow swingers to get in touch for ‘casual sex, discreet relationships’, saying he was ‘attached and looking for discreet fun’. Mr Chameberlain told police he was 3,000 miles away in Costa Rica when Valerie Graves (pictured) was killed . He described his job as ‘Director of fun and pleasuring’, boasted ‘I’m VERY wealthy’, and said his ‘sexual interests’ included threesomes. Mr Chamberlain is still abroad with his wife Caroline, 63, and their two children, but his lawyer Paul Dixon said his client is mystified by how the photographs and email address have appeared on the site, and that it was nothing to do with him. Mr Dixon said the photographs were quite old, and added: ‘It’s something Mr Chamberlain will look into when he gets back.’ Mr Chamberlain has had brushes with scandal before. In the 1980s he was coach of the highly successful Kingston Basketball Club in south-west London, through which he met then-player Nigel Acres. Mr Acres, now 59, went on to become a firm friend and was house-sitting in Bosham alongside girlfriend Janet Graves, 60, her mother Eileen Graves, 87, and Valerie Graves, who was found dead on Monday. In 1985, the basketball club won the national championships, but a year later Mr Chamberlain switched jobs to manage Kingston council’s leisure centre. In 1988, he was suspended after two of his former star basketball players were pictured at his leisure centre alongside ‘glamour model’ Paula Meadows, in a magazine feature entitled ‘Confessions of a porn star’. Looking for clues: Police officers search the area surrounding the £1.6million home in Bosham, West Sussex, where Miss Graves was found dead on Monday. She had suffered severe head and facial injuries . Mr Chamberlain was cleared of involvement in the pictures. More recently, he has been embroiled in a court case involving the company AV Station plc, jointly owned with his wife. It was among companies sued by the Premier League for selling decoders to allow pubs to show satellite football matches at a cut price.","House-sitter Valerie Graves was murdered at mansion in West Sussex .

She has been home-schooled for almost three years - too scared to return to the place that made her life insufferable. So deep were the wounds of her bullying, Renata was became afraid to go out in public, scared of being called 'that girl with the big nose' one more time. 'Im just afraid I'll never have any friends or anyone to be there for me,' she said through tears during an interview with TODAY. But the 15-year-old, who did not share her last name or hometown publicly,  took her first steps of confidence in a long time when she set out to get plastic surgery to regain some of her self-esteem. Scroll down for video . Fifteen-year-old Renata wanted to get plastic surgery so she can stop being teased about her nose, saying through tears she was worried she'd never have any friends. Renata, who has been home-schooled for years because of bullies, said she was constantly referred to as 'that girl with the big nose' She then made a decision to change her physical appearance in order to help her emotional state . Renata sent a letter to Dr Thomas Romo at the Little Baby Face Foundation in New York, a non-profit organization that help children with birth defects who can't afford corrective surgery . The teen was convinced that changing her physical appearance would help change her emotional outcome. However there was a problem - Renata's mother could not afford a cosmetic operation. A nose job from a well-regarded surgeon in Manhattan, for example, costs around $7000. But after some research, Renata discovered the Little Baby Face Foundation, a plastic surgery group that treat children with birth defects for free. The leader of the foundation, Dr. Thomas Romo - the director of facial, plastic and reconstructive surgery at Lenox Hill Hospital - said the group received hundreds of letters from children every year requesting surgery after being bullied. Dr Romo defends such practices, comparing the results to the gratefulness of a heart surgery patient that is able to go jogging again. Renata's mother agreed with her daughter's choice of surgery, saying that 'unfortunately people are judged on how they look' Renata was granted the surgery by the Little Baby Face Foundation after Dr Romo determined she had a deviated septum and lopsided face . Renata is prepped for a corrective rhinoplasty procedure and chin implant . 'We can't go after the bully - but we can try and empower the children,' he said. Renata's mother agree, maintaining elective surgery did not mean the bullies had won. 'I dont think it's sending the wrong message - (Renata) still sees what she sees in the mirror and it has an affect on her self esteem and confidence regardless of what anyone says,' the mom said. 'Parents crack children's teeth with braces to make their teeth straighter - they're still the same kid on the inside. 'Unfortunately people are judged on how they look.' Dr Romo agreed to take on Renata's case after meeting with her. He determined she had a deviated septum and a lopsided face and agreed to do the surgery. Dr Romo removed the bandages from Renata's face following her surgery and recovery . Big reveal: Renata sees her new face for the first time after a few weeks of being bandaged up following surgery . What a difference: Renata's appearance is noticeably different following her surgery, in which she had a nose job and a chin implant . Happy: Renata says she is pleased with the result and is now ready to return to school, having spent the past few years being home-schooled . Renata then underwent a rhinoplasty procedure. Dr Romo also put in a cheek implant to balance out her face. The teen said she is happy and thankful for the results. 'I think if (the bullies) see you getting the surgery to fix something that they teased you about it would make them feel bad and maybe it would change their mind about doing it,' she said. Renata will this year start at a new school. The full report will appear on Dateline NBC on Sunday.

Eight big cat sightings have been reported to police in Cambridgeshire over the last three years, prompting fears the fabled 'Fen Tiger' may be on the loose in the county. New figures show that in 2013 alone big cats were spotted in a back garden in Friday Bridge, on a . road in Comberton and there was a report of a 'heavily mauled deer . carcass' in Melbourn. Between 1998 and 2010 there were 63 calls to Cambridgeshire Police reporting sightings of the mysterious 'Fen Tiger' - a big cat that has apparently been stalking the area since 1982. Stalking: There have been at least eight big cat sightings in Cambridgeshire over the last three years. Since 1998 there have been 63 calls to police about big cats in the county . In 2012 the owners of some sheep reported their flock being attacked by an 'unknown animal, possible cat'. Cyclist Gavin Elliott-Turner also claimed to have spotted two large 'panther-like creatures' in the snow in Melbourn in 2012, but did not report it to police. Officers received a report from another resident of a 'puma type animal' running across a garden in Upwood in 2011. Official data also shows three reported sightings in 2010 including a 'large cat seen in a garden in Somersham and a 'very large wild cat' described as looking like a Lynx in Little Eversden. A large wild cat was also reported for attacking domesticated cats in Great Shelford. These giant feline footprints were photographed in Cambridgeshire in January 2009. Residents called police 63 times from 1998 to 2010 convinced they had spotted the  fabled Fen Tiger . Spotted: This map shows big cat sightings in Cambridgeshire since 1982. Eight big cats have been reported to police in the county in the last three years alone . Kerry Goodayle (left) and Rachel Slater (right) spotted giant paw prints in the snow in Cambridge in 2009 . Over the last 10 years, there have been dozens of sightings of big cats in Gloucestershire. Dubbed the 'Beast of Woodchester', one such big cat was held responsible for two deer carcases found in the countryside near Stroud. In 2012 the National Trust commissioned tests to see whether they could confirm that a big cat had killed the deer, but the results could only establish the presence of fox saliva. Despite this, big cat experts came forward to suggest that although foxes may have scavenged on the deer after they died, they could still have been killed by a big cat. Gloucestershire resident Wilf Ashman, 72, says he has seen a big black cat seven times in the past ten years, most recently in 2010. Other recent sightings include a 'pure white predator' spotted in nearby Nailsworth, just weeks before the two dead deer were found. Naturalist Jonathan McGowan, from Dorset, said more big cats are being spotted because of 'lack of vegetation.' He added: 'They certainly do exist. There are more and more of them. Two out of three sightings are genuine.' 'There are more pumas and big cats around at this time of year as it is mating season. The males roam around more to find females. And there will also be youngsters that have been kicked out by their mothers... The breeding season is between now and February.' Mr McGowan added: 'The academics are now starting to come on board and realise there really are big cats in the UK.' The first reported sighting of a big cat in Cambridgeshire was in the village of Cottenham in 1982. Two sightings were reported to police in 1998, nine in 2000, five the next year, nine in 2002 and six the next year. In 2006 sheep were found dead in Huntingdon with claw marks and a 'large cat' was seen on a common in St Neots. The trail led to Hauxton, Sawtry and Elm in 2009 and more sightings in Upwood and Somersham last year. No ordinary cat: The paw prints measured around five inches long - far larger than those of a domestic cat . The Cambridgeshire paw prints are around the same size as a human hand. 'Panther-like creatures' were first reported in Comberton village in 1982. Since then there have been scores of sighting reported to police . There have also been sightings in villages between Royston and the M11. Paul Westwood, from the Big Cat . Monitors group - which collates sightings across the UK, said: 'It is . quite possible that there are big cats in Cambridgeshire. 'It . is quite a good place with plenty of cover and a lot of food around. It . is a great habitat for any big sized cat to live in.' In 2012 keepers at nearby Shepreth Wildlife Park, near Royston, in Hertfordshire, set up CCTV cameras after four sightings were made in just two months. And in the same year Alan Bates, of Fordham, near Newmarket, reported seeing a black panther-like beast on a country road in Shepreth.","At least eight big cat sightings in Cambridgeshire over the last three years .

A young Virginia man who, as a juvenile, was given six life sentences plus 118 years in prison for an armed robbery in which no one was hurt is asking for a conditional pardon from outgoing Governor Bob McDonnell. Travion Blount's lawyers claim he should serve no more than 20 years for his part in the September 2006 robbery, which he carried out as a 15-year-old with two 18-year-olds who received 10-year and 13-year sentences in plea deals. Blount, who is now 23, refused a plea agreement and was found guilty by a Norfolk jury. A Circuit Court judge then handed down what many believe is the longest sentence in the country given to a teenage offender for a crime that wasn't murder. Unfair sentence: Travion Blount, pictured, was given six life sentences plus 118 years in prison in 2007 for an armed robbery in which no one was hurt, is asking for a conditional pardon from outgoing Governor Bob McDonnell . He has been in Wallens Ridge State Prison, a maximum-security facility in Big Stone Gap, since 2007. According to The Virginia Pilot, the teens raided a house party, stealing cellphones, a small amount of cash and marijuana, records show. No shots were fired and Blount injured no one. The three were quickly caught and charged by police. 'There is no arguing that the crime committed was trivial,' the man's appeal for a conditional pardon reads, adding that the teen was 'naive and unduly influenced' by the much older boys. 'What is arguable is the fact that, out of three individuals who committed the crime, only one person will die in prison.' Tragic: Travion Blount's lawyers claim he should serve no more than 20 years for his part in the September 2006 robbery, which he carried out as a 15-year-old.

Pardons are often granted at the end of elected terms and McDonnell leaves office January 11. Such pardons grant early release with conditions for keeping on good behavior. Blount's clemency appeal states that he will abide by any conditions the Governor sees fit. The petition also lists Blount's criminal history - he was convicted for unauthorized use of a vehicle, robbery, attempted robbery and malicious wounding in four separate incidents. A Change.org online petition has been set up on Blount's behalf to lobby state officials for a new sentence. Monique Santiago, an accountant from Hampton, read about Blount's case and thought the punishment was excessive. Longest sentence: Blount, who is now 23, refused a plea agreement and was found guilty by a Norfolk jury.

His layer John Coggeshall said publicity has helped the case. 'It's time to bring this into the political arena as well as the legal arena,' he told The Pilot. Virginia is one of a few states where a judge can sentence a juvenile to life without parole for crimes such as rape, abduction and robbery.

It means the third round tie at Birmingham City that awaited the winners on Tuesday will have to be pushed back. The Bournemouth v Burton Albion tie was called off two hours before kick-off for the same reason. Hard work: Crawley's groundsman Matt Moss tries to get the Cup tie with Bristol Rovers on - but in vain . Meanwhile, Portsmouth's League Two clash with Accrington at Fratton Park was also postponed due to a waterlogged pitch. The decision was made after a Friday afternoon pitch inspection by local referee Andy Davies. He told Portsmouth's official website: 'The pitch was very wet, with standing water in various areas. 'It's . barely playable at the moment, but we've also had to take into account . the weather forecast, which is pretty dire for the next 24 hours. 'The pitch would therefore be unplayable and it would be dangerous for the players, which is our ultimate concern.'

Also in the fourth tier, the game at Whaddon Road between Cheltenham Town and Chesterfield was postponed following an early pitch inspection on Saturday morning. Motherwell's Scottish Premiership match with Inverness has been postponed due to a waterlogged pitch at Fir Park.

'No date has, as yet, been confirmed for the rearranged fixture.' A number of non-league fixtures have also been postponed already, including the Skrill Conference Premier fixtures at Forest Green Rovers, Welling United and Woking. The National Hunt meeting at Wincanton has been abandoned due to a waterlogged track. Like much of the country the Somerset track has been by heavy rain during the week, but clerk of the course Barry Johnson remained hopeful the fixture could beat the weather as he called an inspection for 7am. However, even more rain than was forecast fell overnight and Johnson called off proceedings before the scheduled inspection time. He said: 'We have already abandoned, I'm afraid. 'It's disappointing as the boys worked so hard on Friday and the track was raceable at 5pm. We thought at that stage the track could take a bit more rain, but we've had far more than forecast. 'We thought we might get six or seven millimetres, and we would probably have coped with that, but it started raining at 1.30am and it was torrential until 6am. 'We've had 14 millimetres of rain already and it's still raining, so unfortunately we've been beaten by the weather.' With the Met Office issuing a number of weather warnings across the country, further postponements are likely and a number of football clubs will hold pitch inspections on Saturday morning.

Despite costing thousands of pounds, pectoral implants are becoming increasingly popular among men desperate to boost their upper bodies without hitting the gym. But swapping sinew for silicone can have disastrous consequences as 44-year-old hairdresser, Brett, knows only too well. Four years ago, the Australian got implants to boost his confidence after his marriage ended, only to be left in excruciating pain after developing an aggressive infection in one. Painful: Hairdresser Brett was left with a lopsided chest after one of his pec implants became badly infected . Embarrassing: Brett says the experience left him feeling like a freak . Worse, when the implant was removed, it left him with a disfigured chest that appeared totally lopsided. Speaking about the havoc wrought on his body, Brett, who appears in TLC documentary Extreme Beauty Blunders, said: 'In a way, it looks like I have two different bodies joined together. 'There's no other word than freaky, or feeling like a freak that something's gone wrong with you. What I feel is that it's holding me back, that I was stupid to have the surgery done in the first place when there was really nothing wrong with my body to start with.' In the years since the operation, the hairdresser has been forced to hide his chest in baggy clothing and says his lopsided chest has had a dramatic effect on his confidence. 'I dreamed of being a bit more buff and had the chest implants for a quick lift to my body and self-esteem,' he explains. 'I thought I would feel so good about myself... that would be the dream come true but it's not come true. 'The pain that I experienced with the swelling and the implant was horrific. My biggest fear is that I can't be helped. I just want my symmetry back.' According to Dr Vik Vijh, a cosmetic surgeon who specialises in repairing botched surgery, pectoral implants are a particularly risky procedure. 'The female breast implant is soft, so . when it pushes against the tissue, it gives way,' he explains. 'A pec implant is solid. When it pushes against the tissues, the tissues give way - Brett could end up with a moob.' Assessment: Dr Vik Vijh, an expert in repairing botched operations, assesses the damage to Brett's chest . Warning: Leading cosmetic surgeon Dr Roberto Viel says that chest implants are always a bad idea . And he's not the only surgeon to warn of the potentially damaging effects of chest implants. Dr Massimiliano Marcellino of the London Center of Aesthetic Surgery says that choosing the right doctor is key as badly inserted pec implants can lead to serious consequences. 'Brett's case sounds extremely worrying,' he says, adding: 'It is very important that you . choose a reputable surgeon to gain the desired effect with the right . experience.' Colleague Dr Roberto Viel is also wary of pec implants, which unlike the version created for breasts, are relatively solid - and hard to remove. 'We strongly discourage our patients to undergo pec implants, the risk of reaction (capsular contraction) and dislocation are too high plus those implants do look fake. 'Men with big chests are not seen as particularly trendy and they have difficulties in dressing suits and shirts. 'If we do need to augment male chest we use submuscular  lipofilling (fat injection) which it looks rather more natural and it is very safe. 'There . are so many options and all are subject to body proportions and what . will benefit the individual best - this is why you need to always talk to . an expert where cosmetic surgery is concerned.' For Brett, there's no choice and the only option left is to have his second pec implant removed. 'I'm looking forward to going to the gym and building up some muscle,' he adds. 'Hopefully, I'll one day have a normal looking chest again.' Extreme Beauty Disasters airs tonight at 8pm on TLC .","Hairdresser Brett, 44, was left in agony after a chest implant got infected .

Al-Qaida militants today fought off government forces to hold on to two of Iraq's main Sunni cities in some of the worst violence the area has seen in years. Iraqi troops and allied tribesmen today surrounded the western city of Fallujah, firing artillery at up to 150 militants, an anonymous military official said. Troops also made forays into the city of Ramadi, he added. Al-Qaida's local branch, known as the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant, have held the two cities and nearby towns in western Anbar province since Wednesday. Violence: Burned vehicles and damaged buildings in Fallujah, 40 miles west of Baghdad, today . Fighters attacked in a series of assaults on Wednesday, taking over police stations, freeing prisoners and grabbing security forces' vehicles. Al-Qaida is reportedly trying to project itself as the champion of the Sunnis. For the past year, many have protested against the government of Shiite Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki, saying it discriminates against their community. Anger was exacerbated over the past week after authorities arrested a senior Sunni politician and dismantled a months-old sit-in in Ramadi. In an attempt to calm the situation, al-Maliki pulled some military out to give local police security duties - a top demand of Sunnis. But after the uprising, the military rushed reinforcements back in - a move supported by allied Sunni tribal fighters. Government official Dhari al-Rishawi said today clashes - some of the worst in five years - were still underway, adding militants remain in control of Fallujah and some parts of Ramadi, Anbar's capital. Crowds: Muslim worshippers crowd a street as they attend open air Friday prayers in Fallujah today. Militants seized the city on Wednesday . On Thursday, government warplanes fired Hellfire missiles - recently supplied by the United States - at some militant positions. In Fallujah, al-Qaida fighters appeared at Friday prayers on the city's main streets. One of them appealed to the worshippers for support, saying his men were there to protect them from the government. Other fighters circulated through the city in seized police vehicles, saying on loudspeakers, 'We are your brothers from the Islamic State in Iraq and Levant. 'We are here to protect you from the government. We call on you to cooperate with us' The resident said he saw militants stationed around government buildings, and that a number of families had fled for fear of fighting inside the city, where state services have become sparse. Deaths: Worshipers look at blood stains at the site of a bomb attack near a Sunni mosque in Kirkuk . Fallujah and Ramadi were major strongholds for Sunni insurgents - including al-Qaida - during the U.S. presence in Iraq, when Sunnis rose up against the Americans and the government. But al-Qaida's branch was largely defeated when many Sunni tribes turned against it and helped U.S. forces in battling it. Many Sunni tribes remain deeply opposed to al-Qaida, even thought they complain of discrimination by al-Maliki's government. So far, casualties from the fighting since Wednesday are not known. Reports today suggest two policemen have been killed and six others wounded when their patrol was attacked by gunmen in speeding cars outside Fallujah.","Government forces today surrounded Sunni cities Ramadi and Fallujah .

The unidentified Detroit Red Wings fan tried to jump into a live report from outside Wednesday’s NHL Winter Classic, in Ann Arbor, Michigan, and fell hard on to the sidewalk. Wintry weather in the area that day left a slick coating on to of most surfaces, something the fan clearly didn't take into account. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Grand entrance: At first, the fan appears to cleverly slide into the live shot . The report was from outside a hockey game between the Red Wings and the Toronto Maple Leafs in front of well over 100,000 fans in heavy snow squalls. It was the latest installment of the NHL's annual outdoor game, this time held at the University of Michigan football stadium known as 'The Big House.' A Red Wings fan jumps into view from the right side of the screen with his arms wide open and a big grin on his face. The fan is decked out in a team jersey and hat, as well as sun glasses. Down he goes: Then his feet fly out from under him . The agony: He slowly gets up after falling on the icy cement sidewalk . Licking his wounds: He then sheepishly slinks off as if nothing happened . He is unable to find his footing. His feet hit the ice and come right out from under him, causing him to almost face-plant when he falls down. The reporter appears to be unaware of what just happened, and advises people to come down to the stadium to 'check out the fan fair even if they have no tickets.' The fan, wearing the jersey of hall of fame Red Wings captain Gordie Howe, sheepishly gets up and staggers off licking his wounds. That wasn’t the only setback the he would deal with Wednesday, the Red Wings lost the game 3-2 in an overtime shootout. A Detroit player lost control of the puck as he made his way toward the goalie – snow on the ice caused it to skip up instead of gliding. The wintry weather took the fan’s feet out from under him and a potential win from his team.","The reporter was outside Wednesday's NHL Winter Classic .

In dusty aviation graveyards around the world, abandoned planes are being stripped for parts by a pair of brothers who turn them into bespoke, high-end furniture. Brett and Shane Armstrong from Kent travel the globe collecting scrap from the aviation industry and transform the junk into desks, coffee tables, sofas and clocks. Among their designs is a £7,000 chair made from a Martin Baker MK10 ejector seat, as well as a £25,000 sofa made from the fuel tank of a Corsair jet. Brett (left) and Shane (right) Armstrong from Kent have scoured the world's aircraft graveyards looking for interesting items they can rescue and turn into furniture. Their range includes this £25,000 red leather, three-seater sofa made from the fuel tank of Corsair jet . Hangar 54 is not the first company to create bespoke furniture from aviation parts. Californian company Motoart spends hours transforming wings, doors and engine cowls into stylish furniture. Many of the parts require more than 100 hours of cutting, grounding, buffing and polishing before they are ready to buy. The company's bomber seats even come with the original ejector pin and 'remove before flight' warning tag. Its prices range from from £65 for a desk watch to £39,000 for a one-of-a-kind conference table, made from a wing. The sofa, built into the rear of the droptank, is made of red leather and can seat up to three people. There is also a circular office desk made from a Boeing 737 engine cowling, with a 15ft diameter. It can be bought on its own or with a matching recycled elevator from a Douglas DC-3 airliner. The DC-3 was introduced in 1936. It was active until 1942, and again in 1950, before being retired. Only 607 of the fixed-wing propeller planes were ever made. The vintage Martin Baker ejector seats were taken from RAF Tornados. They now pass as luxury chairs and bar stools worth £7,000. Others designs created by the Armstrongs' firm Hangar 54 include chairs made from Martin Baker MK10 ejector seats, like the one pictured. The British rocket-powered seat was built by Martin Baker in the 1970s. By 1989, the seat was fitted into 28 different types of aircraft . Another design is the time-zone wall clock made from a piece of Boeing 747 fuselage, pictured, and its windows. The clock costs £1,200 per window and any time zone can be added .

It costs £20,000. The firm has also created other circular office desks from the engine's cowling which are 15ft in diameter . Hangar 54 charges £1,250 from this coffee table made from the tail of a bomb . Inspired after seeing an old engine cowling being used as a table, Brett, from Tunbridge Wells, said: 'We realised we could a better job and we sat down and realised there was a great business opportunity to create unique pieces of furniture finished to a high standard. ‘We also liked the idea that some of these wonderful pieces from the aviation world weren’t going to be lost or wasted forever. ‘These items are really pieces of scrap that are scrap value that have been brought back to life and turned into a thing of beauty a that also has a practical purpose. ‘Some items, like the ejector seats, were quite easy to look at and think of as a piece of furniture. 'Other pieces, like the belly tank sofa, took a bit more imagination. ‘But a lot of these parts are extremely hard to find, such as the Martin Baker ejector seats. 'We have got three of them at the moment. While the wall clock comes from the fuselage of 737-400s which are readily available.'","Recycled aircraft parts are collected by Brett and Shane Armstrong .

The Smithsonian collection contains some of the world’s most precious natural specimens and historical artefacts, from prehistoric fossils to Lincoln’s life mask and Amelia Earhart’s air suit, but it is impossible to put them all on display. Now the museums have embarked on an ambitious project to catalogue important pieces from their collections in 3D and you can browse exhibits online from the comfort of your armchair. The X3D collection features objects that highlight different applications of 3D capture and printing, and it is envisioned that the archived digital items will be used for research, education and conservation. Scroll down for 3D models . The X3D collection features objects from the Smithsonian collection  that highlight different applications of 3D capture and printing, including a cosmic Buddha. The statue is covered in low-relief etching that can be most clearly seen using 3D scanning technology . Objects among those scanned in 3D are a woolly mammoth fossil and the Wright Flyer, which is the first successful powered aircraft, designed and built by the Wright brothers, who flew it four times in December 1903 in North Carolina. The scan of the aircraft allows users to explore the fine details of the artefact, so they have a new way of understanding the principles of flight without visiting the National Air and Space Museum in Washington DC. A Cosmic Buddha, on show at the Freer and Sackler Galleries, also in Washington DC, enables people to see the amazing relief etchings, of which scholars have traditionally made rubbings to study.

Experts said 3D scanning alongside other imaging techniques, can give more clarity to the designs. To capture the detail of a large whale fossil, Smithsonian palaeontologists documented skeletons from a site in Chile’s Atacama Desert to get data about the arrangement and condition of the skeletons before they were removed. The Smithsonian X 3D explorer contains a number of tools for examining the objects so that users can rotate exhibits, such as the National History Museum’s Woolly Mammoth, take measurements and adjust colour and lighting to see detail as well as possible.

The iconic mammal of the Ice Age which went extinct 10,000 years ago can be viewed in 3D. The scan of the composite skeleton allows scientists to study the biomechanics and palaeobiology of very large mammals, whose bones are cumbersome and logistically difficult to manipulate in real life. The 3D model of Kansas-born Amelia Earhart’s flight suit allows people to look inside to see the manufacturer, Arnold, Constable & Company, of Paris and New York’s label. Ms Earhart became the first woman to cross the Atlantic Ocean by plane I 1928, accompanying pilot Wilmer Stultz in a Fokker tri-motor from Newfoundland to Wales. In 1932 she flew alone, from Newfoundland to Ireland and earned worldwide acclaim by becoming the first woman to fly solo across the Atlantic. A scan of Liang Bua Cave - a research site on the Island of Flores, Indonesia. The fossil species Homo floresiensisathe ahobbita was discovered there in 2003 and Smithsonian archaeologists have been excavating the cave since 2010 to understand more about the time . A copy of a cast of Lincoln’s gaunt face that was taken a day before his 56th birthday by sculptor Clark Mills, has been recorded with a 3D scanner. Life masks were popular in the 19th Century and throughout the Civil War Lincoln wanted to make himself visible to the American people and show how the war had aged and tired him. A ‘storytelling’ feature on the website means that visitors to the website can take guided tours of objects with Smithsonian curators. Objects among those scanned in 3D are a Woolly mammoth fossil and the Wright Flyer (pictured), which is the first successful powered aircraft, designed and built by the Wright brothers, who flew it four times in December 1903 in North Carolina . Günter Waibel, the director of the . Institution’s Digitisation Programme Office said the 3D technology is . being used to make museum collections and scientific specimens more . widely available for anyone to use and study. ‘Smithsonian X 3D explorer and the initial objects we scanned are the first step in showing how this technology will transform the work of the Smithsonian and other museums and research institutions,’ he said. The Smithsonian collection comprises 137million objects, artworks and specimens and capturing the entire collection in 3D at a rate of one item every minute would take over 260 years if experts worked around the clock. The scan gives an insight into the excavation of a whale fossil from Cerro Ballena, a palaeontological site in Chile. Smithsonian experts captured vital data about the arrangement and condition of the skeletons discovered before they were moved . The group of museums aim to digitalise 10 per cent of their collections, just one per cent of which are on display to the public. The project will enable people to examine rare archived items they have never been able to see before, which will also benefit scientists and researchers. A 3D scan of David Livingstone's gun.

Seven-year-old Rhiane Francois is undergoing chemotherapy for leukaemia - but if the treatment is not effective she will also need a bone marrow transplant. Because Rhiane has Mauritian and Asian heritage it may be hard to pair her to a donor as a matching donor is most likely to come from a similar ethnic background.

'That's why we are urging everyone eligible to join Anthony Nolan's bone marrow register now, especially people from ethnic minorities. 'You could be a matching donor for Rhiane or someone else out there who desperately needs a transplant.' The youngster was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukaemia in September last year.

The footage of a group walking towards the scene shows a man with spiky hair, a woman with long blonde hair . and a distinctive handbag, and a couple - a man wearing a woolly hat, a . hoody and a gilet accompanied by a woman wearing a short sleeved black . dress with long dark hair. A £5,000 reward remains on offer for any information that will lead to prosecution. Detective Superintendent Christine Wilson, of Humberside Police’s major incident team, . said: 'There was an altercation between the two groups and it looks like . he was trying to be the peacemaker and calm things down and has been . assaulted for his troubles.

Comedian Dean Obeidallah had said: 'It really sums up the diversity of the . Republican party, the RNC. At the convention, they find the one black . person.' Kieran, pictured with his mother Andelyne, has been adopted by Mitt Romney's son Ben . And actress Pia Glenn added: 'One of these things is not like the others, one of these things just isn't the same.' Although Harris-Perry, who is African-American, did not directly ridicule the baby, she said during her apology on MSNBC that the idea behind the segment was the result of 'poor judgment'. 'Given my own family history I identified with that picture and I intended to say positive and celebratory things,' she said.

Icebound: The ship will be stuck until the ice thins but experts claim the situation was 'easily predictable' An experienced polar explorer has accused climate scientists who hired a ship now trapped in Antarctic ice of endangering passengers and crew – by carrying out the expedition ‘on the cheap’. Dozens of scientists, journalists and tourists were evacuated by helicopter from the stricken Russian vessel Akademik Shokalskiy on Thursday after it became stuck on Christmas Eve. The ship was being used by the expedition to follow the route taken by Australian explorer Douglas Mawson in 1912. The team intended to repeat measurements taken by Mawson and so study environmental change over the past century. But their ship is classed as ‘ice-strengthened’, which means it cannot break ice sheets and can operate only in light ice. Robert Headland, of Cambridge University’s Scott Polar Research Institute, blamed the team for not investing in a ship suitable to the ‘easily predictable’ sea ice. Mr Headland, who has completed successful missions to where the ship was going, said: ‘The expedition was hopelessly optimistic in trying to carry out this mission on the cheap and has needlessly taken many risks. ‘The team were in an area where it is common for ice to suddenly build up and instead of using an icebreaker, they used an ice-strengthened ship, which is totally unsuitable.’ It is estimated the rescue, after several failed attempts, will have cost £220,000, a bill which is likely to be paid by Australian taxpayers. The 22 Russian crew members are still on board after the remaining 50 tourists were rescued on Thursday . The 22 Russian crew are still aboard and have to wait until the ice thins before they head home. An expedition spokesman said that it ‘involved two years of planning, with excellent preparation.

It said the 'distortion of historical facts' in films including 300 and Argo prompted them to meet. Conference secretary Mohammad Lesani was quoted as saying: 'One of the main aims of the meeting is to unify all cultural communities in Iran against the attacks of the West, particularly Hollywood.'

Famous: Due top the wonderful growth of hair, Linus has been facetiously dubbed the Sampson of equine . Growing: After they were bred primarily in captivity, the growth of their hair increased with each generation . Similarity: Children's toy My Little Pony . The wonder horses were known for their rich chestnut color and, more importantly, the amazing length of their manes and tails. After they were bred primarily in captivity, the growth of their hair increased with each generation. Their excessively long manes and tails . would have been a severe hindrance in the wild and needed a lot of care . in a domestic situation. One of the earliest long-maned horses . was a Percheron named Prince Imperial who also laid claim to the . world's longest mane. Prince Imperial originally belonged to Emperor . Charles Louis Napoleon Bonaparte III (nephew of the famous Napoleon). In 1869, a Marion livestock breeder named Jacob Howser traveled to France and bought the horse for $3,000. Howser exhibited Prince Imperial at . fairs and horse shows around the USA and billed him as 'The Greatest . Living Curiosity of This or Any Other Age.' Tales of wonder: Circuses and sideshows often invented exotic stories about their exhibits . High maintenance: Excessively long manes and tails would have been a severe hindrance in the wild and needed a lot of care in a domestic situation . Prince Imperial was credited with having the longest forelock (at 7 ft) and longest mane (at 9 ft 10 inches) in the world, the mane later being described as 14 ft 3 inches at its longest. He weighed 1840 pounds and is believed to have been one of the first Percherons imported into the USA. When not being exhibited, his mane was braided and the braids looped to stop the hair dragging on the ground. Prince Imperial died in 1888, but continue to be a curiosity and money-spinner for his owner. Professor AG Ward stuffed the horse so that Howser could continue exhibiting him.

Record: One of the earliest long-maned horses was a Percheron named Prince Imperial (not pictured) who also laid claim to the world's longest mane . Outside of the sideshow travelling season, the stuffed horse was kept in Howser's living room. After Jacob Howser died, his sons continued to exhibited Prince Imperial. This tradition continued to the next generation, with Jacob Howser's grandsons and great-grandson Jake Howser doing the same. Great-gradson Jake Howser tried to end the tradition and instructed his sons to burn the stuffed horse when Jake died. Display: Even after the horse died they were still considered so interesting that a taxidermy specimen was exhibited . Show stopper: Called Linus this wondrous horse was taken around fairs, show-grounds and museums for many years, showing off her glorious long mane and general good looks . The Wonder Horses of Oregon are remarkable for the great growth of hair in mane and tail, which for length and thickness is not equaled in the world . Luckily for sideshow historians, Prince Imperial was sold to another local family. They cleaned him up and put him on a wheeled platform which they dragged through local parades. He later became the property of Theodore Myers, associate director of the Marion campus of Ohio State University and member of the board of the local historical society.

When Danielle Cornwall-Nash appeared on ITV's dating show Take Me Out in 2013 she hoped to find love and live happily ever after. Now the 24-year-old's dream has come true after she got engaged on New Year's Eve - but not to the man she met on TV. However the matchmaking show presented by Paddy McGuinness can take some credit for the engagement as Danielle's fiance, Luke Hobson, 24, got in touch after seeing her on the box. Big screen proposal: Luke Hobson popped the question to Danielle Cornwall-Nash via a digital billboard on Blackpool Promenade's North Pier . Danielle, from Blackpool, and Leeds-born Luke had been student sweethearts but lost touch after they graduated from university. But seeing Danielle appear on TV prompted Luke to seek her out again. As well as their shared history, they had something else in common since graduating - Luke had also failed to find love on television. He had appeared on Sky's dating show Love Machine, hosted by former Radio One DJ Chris Moyles and X Factor finalist Stacey Solomon, which was also aired last year. When she was looking for love: Dannii appeared on Take Me Out in 2013 and is seen here sharing a joke with host Paddy McGuinness . No likey, no lighty: Dannii won a date on the show but the romance didn't last . After seeing Danielle had also been on TV, Luke sought her out and asked her if she wanted to meet up as 'fellow failed dating show contestants.' Danielle had been picked to go on a date on her fifth appearance on Take Me Out - the popular Saturday night show with the catchphrase 'no likey, no lighty' (as the female contestants turn off their lights if they don't like the male contestant who appears). But while she got on well with Dan from London who she met on the show, their romance did not last. Luke then contacted her out of the blue asking her out. Luke explains: 'We met six years ago in Leeds and we dated for a while. But we were young and went our separate ways when she finished uni and went back to Blackpool. Reunited: Luke, who had been on Sky dating show Love Machine, contacted Dannii - a former university flame - after seeing her on Take Me Out . 'We hadn't spoken to each other for about four or five years, but when I saw her on Take Me Out I text her and suggested we meet up as fellow failed dating show contestants.' The pair met for a drink on Valentine's Day, 2013, and have been together ever since. Luke said: 'It's just one of those things. When we met up again we didn't have to go through dating as we knew each other so well from before.' Then Luke delighted Danielle, who is currently seven months pregnant with his son, on New Year's Eve - which is also her birthday - by popping the question. Thanks to their TV appearances, he gave her a fitting proposal involving a big screen at Blackpool  Promenade's North Pier. Fitting: As they had both been on television, Luke thought a big screen was appropriate for his proposal . Luke said: 'With us both having been on TV I wanted to do something to make a show out of the proposal, and I knew she'd love it. We were in Blackpool for New Year so I asked all her old friends and her family to be there for it.' The couple, who live in Leeds, hope to get married next year. Danielle said: 'I didn't have a clue that Luke was about to propose. I just thought we were going out because it was my birthday as well. 'Then I came out onto the Prom and saw the photograph on the screen and wondered what was going on. I was speechless. It was such a thoughtful and lovely thing to do.'","Danielle Cornwall-Nash appeared on ITV's dating show Take Me Out in 2013 .

There's another quirk in the Obama administration's new health insurance system: It lacks a way for consumers to quickly and easily update their coverage for the birth of a baby and other common life changes. With regular private insurance, parents just notify the health plan. Insurers will still cover new babies, the administration says, but parents will also have to contact the government at some point later on. Right now the HealthCare.gov website can't handle such updates. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . More setbacks: The HealthCare.gov website is unable to handle changes such as the birth of a baby or a marriage . It's a reminder that the new coverage for many uninsured Americans comes with a third party in the mix: the feds. And the system's wiring for some vital federal functions isn't yet fully connected. It's not just having a new baby that could create bureaucratic hassles, but other life changes affecting a consumer's taxpayer-subsidized premiums. The list includes marriage and divorce, a death in the family, a new job or a change in income, even moving to a different community. Such changes affect financial assistance available under the law, so the government has to be brought into the loop. At least 2 million people have signed up for private health policies through new government markets under President Barack Obama's overhaul. Coverage started Wednesday, and so far things appear to be running fairly smoothly, although it may take time for problems to bubble up. Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius calls it 'a new day in health care' for millions of Americans. Insurers say computerized 'change in circumstance' updates to deal with family and life developments were supposed to have been part of the federal system from the start. But that feature got postponed as the government scrambled to fix technical problems that overwhelmed the health care website during its first couple of months. 'It's just another example of `We'll fix that later,' said Bob Laszewski, an industry consultant who said he's gotten complaints from several insurer clients. 'This needed to be done well before January. It's sort of a fly-by-night approach.' 'We are currently working with insurers to find ways to make changing coverage easier while we develop an automated way for consumers to update their coverage directly,' responded an administration spokesman, Aaron Albright. A Dec. 31 circular from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services addressed the problem. In questions and answers for insurers, the government said that the federal insurance marketplace will not be able to add a child until the system's automated features become 'available later.' It does not provide any clue as to when that might take place. Babies cannot yet be added: The government needs to get involved because tax credits and other financial assistance can change . The federal marketplace serves 36 states through HealthCare.gov and call centers. The Medicare agency, which runs the government's other major health programs, is also responsible for expanded coverage under Obama's law. The question-and-answer circular says parents with a new baby will be told to contact their insurer directly 'to include the child immediately' on their existing policy. After the federal system is ready to process changes, parents will have to contact the government to formally bring their records up to date. Mr Albright said parents will be able to add a new child to their policy for 30 days. Having a baby could increase a family's monthly premiums, but it could also mean that the parents are eligible for a bigger tax credit to help with the cost. Under some circumstances, it could make the child or the family eligible for Medicaid, a safety-net program that is virtually free of cost to low-income beneficiaries. 'Add it to the list that shows HealthCare.gov is not done,' Ms Laszewski said.","The problem stems from the HealthCare.gov website being unable to handle such requests .
Such changes affect financial assistance available under the law, so the government has to be involved .
The government has said the feature will become available later, but not given a time frame ."

A British man has been charged with killing a one-year-old girl over Skype after allegedly instructing her Norwegian mother to submerge her in a bucket of water. Ammaz Qureshi, 35, of Pinner, North London is said to have told his 28-year-old mistress to punish the child when her cries interrupted their online chat, and then watched as the toddler was tortured. Qureshi is facing charges of premeditated murder and assault in Oslo after being extradited from Britain in December 2012. Married Qureshi is accused of masterminding months of abuse against the child, including forcing her to eat chilli powder, making her to stay awake, and binding her legs for hours on end. Qureshi, an accountant, was introduced to the Norwegian woman by her brother when she visited London in February 2010. Despite having been married for seven years, he began a sexual relationship with her. The woman returned to Oslo in April 2010, but the relationship continued online and over text. Qureshi is said to have watched on Skype from his London home as his Norwegian mistress dunked the toddler’s head under the water after the child’s screams interrupted their online conversation in October 2010. The second time she was submerged, she lost consciousness and the mother called emergency services. The girl died the next day. When the mother was arrested, she told police Qureshi had been directing her to abuse the child since their relationship began. Prosecutors claim Qureshi, who was not the father of the child, instructed Chaudhry to carry out cruel abuse against her daughter, such as spraying the girl in the face with a bottle of water, forcing her to sleep on the floor and had her head held under running water in the sink. They accuse Qureshi of telling the mother to dunk her child in the bucket, which killed her. Accusations: District Attorney Cecilie Schløsser Møller says Qureshi 'anticipated' the little girl's death . Control: Qureshi is accused of masterminding months of abuse against the child before her death in October 2010, as he stayed in touch with his mistress via online chats and texts . ‘She was subjected to physical violence during disciplining. In the end, it went too far and she died,' Oslo District Attorney Cecilie Schløsser Møller told TV2. ‘By submerging the girl in the bucket, they would have anticipated her death. She was a small, defenceless girl who was subjected to extensive abuse.' Qureshi has been in custody in Oslo for more than a year, following his extradition, and proclaims he is innocent. 'He denies the accusations of premeditated murder and assault. My client is baffled that he is accused of a crime committed in a country which he - at that point in time - had never set foot in,' Vibeke Hein Baera, defending, said. ‘He also says that he has not contributed to this in any kind of way, in fact the opposite.' The mother denies premeditated murder, but admits abusing her child. Trial is set to start this winter in Oslo District Court.","Ammaz Qureshi, 35, is charged with murder in Norway .

A 46-year-old mother of three whose body was pulled from the Saugatuck River in Connecticut last Friday had been struck by a Metro-North train while walking on the tracks. A duck hunter spotted Annette White, of South Paris, Maine, in the frigid waters. According to authorities, the woman suffered blunt impact injuries to her head, torso and extremities. Surveillance footage from Metro-North's Saugatuck train station revealed that a westbound train stopped on the Saugatuck River Bridge for about 20 minutes Thursday evening. Tragic: Annette White, 46, a divorced mother of three, has been identified as the woman whose body was discovered floating in the Saugatuck River in Westport, Connecticut, last Friday . Fatal move: Police believe White, who was new to the area, was trying to cross the Saugatuck River Bridge by going across the tracks when she was killed . In the video, Metro-North personnel emerged from the locomotive, inspected the front of the lead car and searched the tracks, but continued on their way after failing to find any signs of a deadly collision with a pedestrian, CBS Connecticut reported. On Monday, police divers acting on a tip from a Metro-North passanger found Annette White's cell phone and one of her earrings below the tracks where the train came to a stop. Investigators believe White, who was new to the area, was trying to cross the Saugatuck River Bridge by walking across the tracks at around 6.45pm Thursday when she was struck by the oncoming westbound train and tumbled into the icy waters below. At around 9.15am Friday, a hunter in a kayak came across the woman's body near the Saugatuck Harbor Yacht Club in Westport and alerted the authorities. Emergency stop: Surveillance footage from the Saugatuck station showed that a westbound train stopped for 20 minutes and Metro-North personnel inspected the lead car but found no damage to suggest that a person had been struck . Discovery: A police diver found Annette White's cell phone and one of her earrings directly under the train tracks . Closure: A duck hunter in a kayak spotted White's body floating in the frigid waters more than 12 hours after she was struck by the train . An autopsy revealed that White's injuries were consistent with someone being hit by a train. Police believe the woman's death was accidental and did not involve any foul play. However, they have yet to determine why White ended up on the bridge the night of her death. The 46-year-old woman, a Maine native, had lived in Iowa with her husband and three children for more than two decades and taught psychology at Iowa Western Community College. The couple divorced 18 months ago and White moved back to her home state. According to her Facebook page, White began dating another man last year, and in July 2013 she reportedly relocated to Westport, Connecticut. New life: White, a Maine native and long-time resident of Iowa, moved to Westport, Connecticut, in July after divorcing her husband of 22 years and starting a new relationship with another man (right) White's former sister-in-law Suzanne Jankiewicz Mortensen said that the woman was a great mother and an intelligent, warm person. â€˜Why was she on the tracks and didn't she hear the train coming at her?â€™ Jankiewicz Mortensen wondered in her interview with Connecticut Post. Metro-North officials have concluded that the engineer aboard the train that struck White had acted properly.","Annette White, 46, was found dead from blunt impact injuries to her head, torso and limbs floating in the Saugatuck River .

Authorities in Northern California on Friday defended the decision to let a suspect go free just hours before he allegedly murdered a beloved Catholic priest inside a church on New Year’s Day. Humboldt County Sheriff's Lt. Steve Knight said with no serious criminal behavior to hold him, and no evidence of a psychiatric problem, police had no reason to apprehend 43-year-old Gary Lee Bullock after he was spotted loitering outside St Bernard Church in Eureka with a wooden stake in his hands. A few hours later, Reverend Eric Freed, 56, was discovered beaten to death in the rectory of his church. Gary Lee Bullock is led by law enforcement officers into a car in Eureka on Thursday . Police say Bullock had been in and out of custody in the hours before Freed died . Caught: Gary Lee Bullock (left) has been arrested in the killing of Father Eric Freed (right), who was found slain in the rectory of St Bernard Church in Humboldt County . ‘This was standard practice,’ Knight . said. ‘It was truly a tragic, tragic event that this happened after the . fact. Unfortunately, we release people from our jail because we have to, . and they go commit other crimes. There was no indication of anything . unusual here.’ Police Chief . Andrew Mills agreed. He said after the passing security guard noticed . Bullock in the shadows of church grounds, the guard called police, and . an officer confronted Bullock on the street in front of the rectory. The . officer examined Bullock's jail papers, did a field sobriety test, . determined he was mentally competent to be in public then directed him . to a shelter a few blocks away. ‘In . this, I am satisfied our officers did what they could do, given the . parameters of the law,’ said Mills. ‘The question becomes could we have . done other administrative things such as taken him over to the shelter. Would that have been reasonable? We'll have to wrestle with these . questions.’ That frustrates Lisa Russ, who worships at St. Bernard Catholic Church, where Freed was pastor. Well-regarded: Father Freed was remembered by his friends and colleagues as a genuine and warm person who was easy to talk to . Rite of passage: This May 2012 photo provided by Lynn Enemark shows the Reve. Eric Freed administering First Communion in St. Bernard Catholic Church . ‘Our . police do a good job, but something is broken in our system if we can . have people arrested and released,’ she said Thursday night outside the . Gothic church built in 1885 from redwood trees taken from the foggy . coast. ‘We've got people here we want to be caring and compassionate towards,’ she said. ‘But there's got to be a better way.’ When it comes to holding someone in jail, authorities are constrained. Officers . considering a potential ‘5150’ - or involuntary psychiatric hold - must . determine if the person is a danger to himself or others or unable to . care for himself. Because the person isn't under arrest, California law tries to balance public safety with individual rights. Officers must have probable cause to have a person evaluated by a health professional for a 72-hour hold. Vote of confidence: Police Chief Andrew Mills, pictured during a press conference Thursday, said he was satisfied his officers acted properly given the parameters of the law . Bullock, . 43, was well-known to authorities in Humboldt County, the heart of the . Northern California marijuana growing region known as the Emerald . Triangle. He was on probation for misdemeanor convictions for cocaine possession and had no record of violent crime. Bullock . was arrested for investigation of disorderly conduct at 1.27pm on New . Year's Eve at his home town of Redway after a mobile home park resident . noticed him hiding in bushes and ‘acting bizarre,’ said Knight. Because . he was on parole, Bullock was taken to jail in Eureka. On the way, . Bullock tried to kick out the patrol car windows, said Knight. When . he calmed down enough for the jail nurse to examine him, his heart was . racing - too high to be admitted to the jail. So two deputies took him . to the emergency room at St. Joseph Hospital, where doctors pronounced . him fit for jail. Police . said he was held for eight hours - twice the normal time for a . disorderly conduct allegation - before being released 42 minutes after . midnight. He was not given a psychiatric exam.

About . 2am, a security guard passing the church noticed a light on in the . bathroom of the church fellowship hall, and Bullock standing outside. The . guard told Bullock to leave and called police. Later, an officer found . Bullock in front of the rectory and let him go, authorities said. About 3.30am, the security guard spotted Bullock outside the church hall again, this time holding a wooden stake, police said. The . guard told him to be on his way but did not call police. Mills said . investigators think Bullock had not gone into the rectory at this point, . and Freed was still alive. An autopsy has yet to determine time of . death. When Freed did not . show up for morning Mass, someone went looking for him in the rectory. He was found dead, apparently beaten. Police said there were signs of . forced entry and a wooden stake was found. ‘It is a weapon that could have been used in the crime,’ Mills said. Surveillance video from the rectory also shows Bullock outside, Mills said. Surrender: Bullock was spotted by officers riding in his stepfather's pickup truck, on his way to turn himself in . When . a warrant was issued for Bullock's arrest, deputies knew where to find . him. When deputies drove up the six miles of dirt road to the home of . Bullock's mother, they said they came across Bullock riding in his . stepfather's pickup truck, on his way to turn himself in. He surrendered quietly and was being held on $1million bail. He is expected to be arraigned Monday on a murder charge. Officials are still seeking a motive behind the clergyman’s killing, . Freed's body was found by staff Wednesday in the St. Bernard Church rectory after he failed to show up for morning Mass, leaving the parish in shock. Rev. Freed, 56, was the only pastor in St Bernard Church, and had been working in the parish for three years. Bullock has a criminal history that includes a conviction for cocaine possession last year, Redwood Times reported. According to a press release from the Eureka Police Department, Bullock was first spotted in the Garberville area of Humboldt County and arrested for public intoxication on New Year’s Eve. He was taken to jail, but was 'rejected' due to his erratic behavior. Crime scene: Police say Father Freed put up a fight inside the rectory of St Bernard Church but was struck dead by his attacker .

He was released after midnight on New Year's Day. About two hours later, police officers responded to 615 H Street after getting a 911 call about a suspicious person, who turned out to be Bullock. The 43-year-old, however, was no longer intoxicated, and so he was referred to an emergency shelter for the night. Father Freed's body was discovered in the rectory at around 9am. Police say the cleric suffered 'significant blunt force trauma' following a violent struggle with his assailant. The murder weapon was recovered at the scene. An autopsy will be performed later to determine the victim’s exact cause of death. Eureka Mayor Frank Jager said Freed was a personal friend and a ‘tremendous person in this community.’ Days before his death, Rev. Freed sent his parishioners a message of thanks, wishing them happy holidays. ‘I cannot tell you how proud and honored I am to be your pastor,’ Freed wrote on the parish website. ‘Our parish is alive, joyful and full of faith, hope and charity that define us as Catholic Christians.’ Crime scene: The body of Rev. Freed was discovered by staff members of St Bernard's Catholic Church and his car, a 2010 Nissan Altima, has yet to be recovered . Loved: Pastor Freed had been working in Eureka for three years, and had previously taught religious studies at a nearby California State University . Motive: Detectives are still trying to determine what prompted the suspect to kill the beloved cleric . Before arriving in Eureka, Rev.

Declared dead: The California court allowed Jahi McMath's parents to remove her from hospital and keep her alive elsewhere only after a coroner issued a death certificate . The mother of the 13-year-old girl at the centre of a battle to turn off her life-support machine can take her out of hospital still on a ventilator as long as she takes full responsibility for her future, a court heard today. But the apparent breakthrough in the row over Jahi McMath was only made possible after the coroner issued a death certificate for the tragic teenager. Alameda County Superior Court heard that Children’s Hospital, in Oakland, California, and Jahi’s family had come to an agreement over her removal to a new facility for long-term care. The “protocol” stated that Jahi’s mother Nailah Winkfield must agree to be “wholly and exclusively responsible” for her welfare once she has been transferred into her care. She must also provide all the necessary arrangements and hospital expertise. But the move only happened after the Alameda County Coroner issued a death certificate – effectively allowing the hospital to release the body as if it was going for burial or cremation. The seemingly contradictory state of affairs only re-iterates the highly unusual nature of the case, which has to date lasted more than three weeks, divided public opinion and been played out in three courts. Jahi suffered complications following a routine operation to remove her tonsils at Children’s Hospital, in Oakland, California, on December 9. Her heart stopped, causing brain damage that the hospital said was so severe that she was effectively dead with no chance of survival if a respirator was turned off. Devastated: Jahi's parents arrive at court today. They are fighting to keep their 13-year-old daughter alive after she was declared brain dead following complications in routine tonsil surgery . Devotion: Jahi's parents haven't left her bedside since the tragedy during a routine tonsil operation . Three doctors and the court agreed she was brain dead and the hospital applied to turn off her life support machine. But her family, led by Mrs Winkfield and Jahi’s uncle Omari Sealey, refused to accept the prognosis and argued there was still a chance she could recover. They said that she responded to her mother’s voice and asked that she be removed to a hospital that cared for her. They successfully won an injunction preventing the hospital removing life support that was extended and runs out at 5pm on Tuesday. The hospital could not agree on terms that allowed Jahi to be transferred citing ethical and legal reasons why she could not be removed. But now the coroner issued the certificate, they softened their approach and agreed to a path forward which had been proposed by the family’s lawyer Chris Dolan. Hope: Jahi's family are certain that she will one day recover despite the hospital's insistence there is no chance of that happening . Oakland Children's hospital spokesman Sam Singer. The hospital would not accept responsibility for caring for Jahi . Now the race is on to make the arrangements before the deadline runs out on Tuesday. 'There are no winners in this,' said Sam Singer, the spokesman for the hospital. 'This young woman is dead and it is very sad.' Doug Strauss, the lawyer for the hospital, made an emotional plea to the family to finally accept that their daughter was dead. Mr Dolan, for the family, said that the agreed protocol was a step forward. A spokeswoman for Alameda County Coroner confirmed that a “generic” death certificate had been issued but no details were given. The California Department of Public Health continues its investigation into the incident.","Jahi McMath can be kept alive on ventilator at a new hospital, as long as her mother arranges for her care, court rules .

One family traveling from Kennebunk, Maine to Tennessee believes a miracle saved them from being obliterated by an 18-wheeler truck. The massive truck hit where the family's 9-year-old daughter had been sitting just moments before her father pushed her out of harm's way. Justin and Katie Sweeney were with their two children Molly, 9, and Carter, 7, when their Toyota Prius was crushed along with a pile of 35 vehicles on Interstate 95 On December.26. The family was injured, but astonishingly all of them survived. Strangely enough, there was no prediction of snow before the family's departure on the 26th. Harsh snow hit five minutes right before the accident occurred. The Sweeney family are lucky to be alive after their car was nearly missed by an 18-wheeler truck that could have cost them their lives . Justin, who is a pastor at the New Life Church in Biddeford, Maine, recalls pushing his 9-year old daughter out of harm's way just before a huge 18-wheeler truck struck their car. 'As I look at the pictures [of the vehicle] and as I remember that day so vividly, I truly know that it is a miracle that I should have my entire family together, that I didn’t lose my entire family in that crash,' Justin Sweeney said. 'It was the worst day of my life, but a day of blessings. You hug your family tighter and are so thankful for them,' Justin told the Bangor Daily News. The family is now recovering from their non-life threatening injuries. Justin suffered a partially collapsed lung and broken sternum, Molly suffered from numerous pelvic fractures, and Carter and his mom Katie only suffer from scratches and bruises. 'It just crushed through the whole driver’s side of our vehicle. Molly ended up in the middle seat of the Prius and where she was sitting I looked up and there was the gas tank of the 18-wheeler,' said Katie Sweeney. Katie recalls pushing down on the brakes, but she was no match for the icy roads. The family later crawled out the vehicle, gently taking Molly out of the wreckage. Their car was entrenched in a 35-car pile up on a Pennsylvania highway . 'We laid Molly down in the cab. She had her head in Carter’s lap and he was patting her cheeks and he kept telling her, ‘God must have a really great plan for us because we’re still alive,’ Katie Sweeney said. 'He’s 7 and he’s consoling her. It was a real precious moment and we were able to pray together and sing together and it helped to calm their nerves, calm the whole atmosphere. We realized we were all OK and we were going to be all right,' said Katie. The family was initially taken to St. Joseph Medical Center in Reading, Pennsylvania where they had x-rays and numerous tests. Molly was airlifted to The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia and Justin was airlifted to the Pennsylvania Hospital, also in Philadelphia. Katie and Carter who only suffered minor injuries were treated and released. The family's hometown of Kennebunk Maine is doing all they can to support the family and help them heal after they returned from their week of treatment in Pennsylvania hospitals. Justin recalls instinctively pushing his 9-year-old daughter Molly out of harm's way . Since medical bills can run high, a friend of the family named Nicole Rossics set up a gofundme.com account to help the family raise money to get well. So far the page has raised over their $10,000 goal. That goal started at $3,000, then $5,000, but kept going up as charitable donors exceeded the amounts. 'When I heard this happened, it’s like ‘oh my gosh,’ you just want to help,' Rossics said. 'They’re just good, good, good people. These things only happen to the best people,' said Rossics. Molly and Nicole Rossics' daughter both do gymnastics together and when Rossics heard of the accident, she felt the need to help the family. Molly competes as a gymnast competitively but currently is in a wheel chair.The family says she has done 'miraculously well' with physical therapy but that she still has a long way to go. 'She’s just as strong as she can be, she’s incredible. She has this little stubborn determination side to her, which is helpful in these situations,' Katie Sweeney said. 'We’ve absolutely been blown away by the support of friends and family, our church family, our neighbors,' Justin Sweeney said. 'People have been so creative with their generosity and kindness. They’ve gone above and beyond,' he continued. Their Toyota Prius was completely totaled after the freak accident . Even though the Sweeneys are thankful for help, they also find it hard to accept. 'Anything you can give as a thank you just seems to fall so short. What card can I write in order to make it sound worthy of what is being done? There are just no words that can really describe how we feel,' she said. 'It’s humbling. We feel loved. It’s always a little bit more fun to be on the giving end. At the same time, this is how the Lord is choosing to organize things and I certainly don’t think it’s a coincidence. I think things are orchestrated for a reason. I’m so thankful people’s hearts are soft for us. We feel very loved and fortunate to be here in this community.' Katie Sweeney told the Bangor Daily News that this Holiday, the Sweeney family got the best gift they could ever ask for. 'I look around at my family and we are each other’s greatest gifts,' she said. 'We’re very lucky to have each other.'

His fans soon grew from a few dozen to several thousand. Another resident, Susan Hardoerfer, was particularly taken by the young man and. 'I admire him. I was like, wow, there is a hard working young man. I was amazed he was always, always dancing,' Hardoerfer told WCPO Cincinnati. The Zumba instructor marched into the mattress store and demanded Crothers get a raise. She also learnt some things about him - he had been accepted to his dream college, Ohio State University, but couldn't afford to go.

Blaring Eye Of The Tiger and dancing, cheering and holding handmade signs, the caring crew first moved Crothers to dance some more and then to tears. To make the moment even more poignant, a PayPal account set up to accept donations for Crothers college was put on the Facebook page. The donations, couple with Crother's dancing money, have allowed him to enrol in college for spring. 'I was raised by parents who instilled in me a strong worth ethic,' Crothers said.

'The fact it had that kind of impact on others is remarkable to me and means a lot to me,' he said. 'I can’t even describe how grateful I am. Everyone who organized and everyone who participated don’t really know me. They are incredibly kind and I am grateful for them.'","Cody Crothers was accepted to Ohio State University but had to turn down the offer because he couldn't afford it .

A teenager was missing last  night after setting out to take  pictures of the fierce storms  battering the coast. Harry Martin was seen heading for the shoreline with his camera just as the worst storm for nearly 20 years approached. Air, sea and land searches were under way along the Devon coast and police say they are ‘extremely concerned’ for the safety of the 18-year-old. Around the country there were reports of stormwatchers heading to the seaside – prompting emergency workers to beg them to  ‘please, please keep away’. But sightseers continued to come ‘by the car load’, according to one exhausted official, to gaze at the raw power of the sea battering coastal defences. Council officers were even forced to call the police to move people away from danger in Burry Port, West Wales. Ron Cant, of Carmarthenshire council, said: ‘What they cannot know is what is in these waves. The sea takes up a lot of rock, rubble and stones and throws them violently about. ‘Stones weighing up to one hundredweight were being flung into the car park and people were literally putting their lives at risk by being there.’ Similar scenes were seen up and down the coasts of Cornwall, Devon, Somerset and Cumbria, with stormwatchers braving winds of up to 90mph that were driving 30ft waves in from the Atlantic. Mark Pilcher, of the Environment Agency, said: ‘I know people like to go out and look at the drama of the waves but please, please do not put yourself at risk.’ High seas batter the Cobb at Lyme Regis, Dorset. Severe flooding is expected in parts of the UK as high tides are set to combine with heavy rain and strong winds . Tony Mansell, of the Royal National Lifeboat Institution, said: ‘Please, please keep away from this water.’ The latest storm – the fourth to hit the country in a matter of weeks – caused chaos yesterday, battering coastal defences, ripping roads apart and flooding hundreds of homes. More than 2,200 miles of coastline in the South and West were affected as the tidal surge swept in from the Atlantic. The Environment Agency, which is facing 550 frontline job cuts this year, is braced for further dramatic weather over the weekend, with relentless rain expected to continue until at least the middle of next week. The agency last night issued at least nine severe flood alerts for the South West, Midlands, Wales and the North West, again warning residents of ‘danger to life’. It also issued 330 less severe warnings and alerts across England. The coastal danger is likely to have . lessened by this morning, but a second low pressure system is expected . to arrive from the Atlantic tomorrow, causing another tidal surge that . will again test sea defences. Emergency services will have to deal . with the prospect of inland flooding as rain falls on ground already . saturated by weeks of wet weather. Forecasters . last night warned more flooding was expected in southern England, . particularly Kent and Gloucestershire, as rivers that burst their banks . over Christmas again reach dangerous levels. Pete Fox, head of strategy at the Environment Agency, said: ‘There does not seem to be an end to the unsettled period.’ Mr Martin, who had recently started a degree in film production, left his home in Newton Ferrers, near Plymouth, at 11am on Thursday as the storm began to develop. Devon and Cornwall Police said he was last seen walking in the direction of the coastal path. Storm and flood warnings have been issued for the south west of England as the bad weather continues . Police, coastguard and lifeboat staff were last night searching areas off the coast and the nearby estuary. The teenager had been at home celebrating Christmas during his holidays from the University of Greenwich in London. His uncle, Darrell Marshall, said: ‘The police and the coastguard are co-ordinating the search at the moment but we have been searching all day for him. ‘He is very interested in photography, he is doing a course in film production at the University of Greenwich, it is part of his course.’ The teenager, who lives with his father Anthony, 57, mother Georgina, 52, and brother James, 21, is thought to have studied creative media production at Plymouth  College of Art. On Thursday, rescuers found the body of a 27-year-old man dragged out to sea in Cornwall and on Tuesday a woman died in similar circumstances at Croyde Bay in north Devon. Another man is thought to have fallen into the Stour river near Christchurch, Dorset, on Wednesday night. And the body of clubber Joanna Brown, 36, was yesterday discovered after she was swept off Brighton’s beach shortly before Christmas. Meanwhile, across the Atlantic, 100million Americans were in the grip of a huge and deadly storm of their own. Called Hercules, the storm dumped up to two feet of snow over a third of the country and claimed at least three lives. Temperatures plunged to a bone-chilling minus 23C. More than 4,000 flights were cancelled and 10,000 were delayed. Courts, government offices and schools were closed with pupils ordered to stay at home. Britons returning from holidays on the East Coast were stranded when airports, including JFK in New York, were shut down. Canada was even colder. Winnipeg in Manitoba reported temperatures of minus 37.9C, chillier even than the North Pole.","Harry Martin left his home in Newton Ferrers, near Plymouth, at 11am on Thursday as the storm began to develop and headed towards coast .

"By . Leon Watson . PUBLISHED: . 16:18 EST, 1 January 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 20:21 EST, 1 January 2014 . The treason trial of former Pakistani president Pervez Musharraf was delayed again yesterday by an explosive device found near his home. Police said officers scanning the route to court spotted the device two miles from the retired general's farmhouse on the outskirts of Islamabad. His lawyers said it was too dangerous for Musharraf to appear. This was the third time since the trial began that explosives have been found. Facing charges: Former Pakistani president Pervez Musharraf (centre) is escorted by soldiers . It's the most serious of the legal troubles the 70-year-old Musharraf has faced since he returned to Pakistan in March. He came back hoping to run in elections but instead had been faced with a barrage of court cases connected to his rule and barred from being a candidate. The case has also brought some grumbling from within the military's supporters, wary that one of their own is in court. For their part, Musharraf's lawyers have contended that the judiciary trying him and the government bringing the case are biased against the former general. The current prime minister, Nawaz Sharif, was the man deposed by Musharraf in the 1999 coup and the recently retired chief justice was also detained by Musharraf in 2007. The judge in Wednesday's hearing, Faysal Arab, was sympathetic to the defense's security concerns and adjourned the hearing until Thursday. But he pointed out the security arrangements and suggested he could issue an arrest warrant for Musharraf if he fails to appear Thursday. Police officer Nayyar Saleem said officials scanning the route to court spotted the device on Wednesday along a road about two kilometers (a mile) from Musharraf's farmhouse on Islamabad's outskirts. One of Musharraf's lawyers, Ahmed Qasuri, told the three-member panel of judges hearing the case that there were 'many security issues' preventing the former leader's appearance and that the court would be responsible if anything went wrong. Former Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf after he resigned from office in 2008 . Islamabad police officials said 1,000 security personnel were deployed to protect Musharraf but said they could not guarantee a bomb-proof vehicle for the former general to ride in. Musharraf's lawyers have also argued that the special court hearing his case was not properly formed, that the individual judges are biased and that the case against him is a vendetta by the prime minster and the recently retired chief justice. At one point during the sometimes testy proceedings, Qasuri pointed his finger at the prosecutor, Akram Sheikh, and said: 'He's not a prosecutor. He's a persecutor!' Musharraf took power in a 1999 coup and ruled Pakistan for nearly a decade. But he's not on trial for the coup. Instead he's accused of high treason in connection with the state of emergency he imposed in 2007 and the detention of judges. Those actions sparked widespread demonstrations by lawyers around the country that eventually weakened the rule of the already unpopular Musharraf so much that he was forced to step down. Musharraf's legal ups and downs have riveted a country that has experienced three military coups and where top generals and army chiefs have traditionally been above the law. The scenes of Musharraf going into and out of court rooms - essentially being treated like a common citizen - has underlined how much prestige the power the Pakistani military has lost in recent years. The army has said nothing publicly about the Musharraf trial but many retired military officers - sometimes a barometer for opinion within the service - have stood up for Musharraf. A group of retired military officers met Tuesday in Islamabad in what was essentially a show of solidarity. Zuha Saeed, a retired major in the Pakistan army, said Musharraf was a 'good general' and that he was worried that the trial would not be 'free and fair.' The government pushed back Wednesday against any suggestion that Musharraf may have the support of the military. Information Minister Pervaiz Rasheed said Musharraf is trying to use the army to cover up his crimes and that the army is a 'national institution' that is devoted to serving their nation, not one individual. Meanwhile, a suicide bomber rammed a bomb-laden vehicle into a bus carrying Shiite Muslim pilgrims through the southwestern city of Quetta, killing two people and wounding an additional 26, said police chief Abdur Razzaq Cheema. There was no claim of responsibility but Sunni Muslim extremists who view members of the Shiite minority sect as heretics have carried out multiple such attacks in Baluchistan in the past.","Former army chief Musharraf is facing high treason proceedings .

Phillip Madol, 33, once studied in America as one of Sudan's 'Lost Boys' who fled bloodshed and famine. This week he was again caught up in a war as he helped his family flee a town that rebels had overrun in South Sudan. Fighting broke out in the capital of South Sudan on December 15 and quickly radiated across the world's newest country as two main ethnic groups began attacking each other. Scroll down for video . Lost boy: Phillip Madol, 33, left, returned from the U.S to help his sick mother. He is now fleeing the fighting in South Sudan and and spoke to a reporter in the town of Awerial on Thursday . Desperation: Displaced people walk to find an unoccupied patch of ground where they can rest after arriving by river barge from Bor on Thursday. They are fleeing from fighting between government and rebel forces in Awerial, South Sudan . The central government is afraid that rebels loyal to ousted Vice President Riek Machar are preparing to march to the capital, Juba, from Bor, the capital of Jonglei state. The U.S. State Department ordered a further drawdown of U.S. Embassy personnel in Juba and another evacuation flight was being arranged. The warring factions held preliminary meetings Friday in neighboring Ethiopia, mediators said. Madol, who previously studied at Grand Rapids Community College in Michigan, returned to South Sudan a couple of months ago after hearing his mother was sick. Her health problems are worse now: She was shot and broke a leg in this week's violence in Bor. 'The White Army just took over after everybody left the village. 'They burned all the huts and they shoot people too during that fight,' said Madol, referring to a common name used for the fighters from the Lou Nuer ethnic group. Escape: Phillip Madol once studied at Grand Rapids Community College in Michigan (pictured here) before returning to Africa . Help: Displaced mothers and their babies who fled from fighting in Bor, many of whom are suffering from dehydration and diarrhea due to the lack of any sanitation, queue outside a clinic run by Medecins Sans Frontieres . South of Bor, thousands of families like Madol's have been fleeing to the Nile River region of Awerial. Families are now camping out in the shade below any tree they can find. Aid groups estimate that perhaps between 60,000 and 75,000 people have streamed out of Bor in search of safety from the armed Lou Nuer, a group seen as loyal to Machar. 'It's hard to get medical (treatment) now,' said Madol. 'All this place is way dirty. All the children are getting dirtier and sick. 'It's kind of hard to tell how people survived and made it through to this side of the river.' Through the decades of civil war fought between Sudan and its southern region, thousands of 'Lost Boys of Sudan' spent years drifting while fleeing bloodshed and famine before landing in other countries like the U.S. Madol was one of those boys. South Sudan peacefully broke away from Sudan in 2011 following a 2005 peace deal that ended a decades-long war. But now fighting has erupted in South Sudan along ethnic lines, ensnaring Madol and many others. Toby Lanzer, the U.N.'s top humanitarian official in South Sudan, said Friday that the situation around Awerial is difficult. Fear: A scene from 1991, when 3,500 unaccompanied 'Lost Boys' arrived from Ethiopia to Southern Sudan. Since the 1980s, Sudan's civil war has displaced at least 20,000 children, mostly boys, who crossed from Sudan to Ethiopia and back, with many dying along the way . Fuel and water: In this photo taken on Thursday, January 2, a displaced girl returns from gathering firewood while others, left, extract water from a well . 'We're working to get as much aid to civilians there as possible,' he wrote on Twitter. The International Red Cross says Awerial is the 'largest single identified concentration of displaced people in the country so far.' Deng Ghai Deng, 19, fled Bor and crossed the Nile with his sister. He said fighting in Bor killed many, and he complained that the displaced families have no safe drinking water, food or shelter. 'Some of the children, even the small kids they are starving in the forest in Jonglei state,' he said. 'They don't have transport so they can cross the river into Lakes state where I am now. The situation is really very bad. 'My mum and dad, they are still in Jonglei state, they are still in the forest. They will not come because of money.' The U.S. announced an additional $50 million in funding assistance, including for U.N. programs and the international Red Cross. The international community says at least 180,000 people have been displaced in the fighting. A conservative estimated death toll stands at least 1,000 people. Human catastrophe: People arrive in Awerial with what belongings they had time to gather onto the river barge from Bor. These are just some of the thousands who fled the fighting between government and rebel forces by boat across the White Nile . President Salva Kiir insists the fighting was sparked by a coup attempt mounted by soldiers loyal to Machar on December 15. But that account has been disputed by some officials of the ruling party who say the violence began when presidential guards from Kiir's Dinka ethnic group tried to disarm those from the Nuer group of Machar. From there, violence spread across the country, with forces loyal to Machar defecting and seizing territory from loyalist forces. South Sudan has been plagued by ethnic tension and a power struggle within the ruling party that escalated after Kiir dismissed Machar as his vice president in July. The rebels back Machar, who is now a fugitive sought by the military. Dina Mufti, a spokesman for Ethiopia's Foreign Ministry, said the introductory meetings in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, were necessary to bridge the groups' differences ahead of direct talks expected to start Saturday.","Philip Madol, 33, ended up in Michigan after surviving bloodshed and famine in South Sudan .

A man claiming to be one of the most decorated Navy SEALs in military history has been rooted out as a fraud after swindling investors for hundreds of thousands of dollars. A.J. Dicken went all the way while weaving fictitious connections to the elite army force, claiming that he was the one who fired the kill shot during the Osama bin Laden raid. The al Qaeda leader wasn't the only international warlord that he brought down either, he said, as he also told confidantes and would-be employees that he was responsible for killing Colombian drug lord Pablo Escobar. Scroll down for video . Facing the facts: A.J. Dicken, 57, is a former bartender with a criminal record who pretended to be a Navy SEAL with numerous awards and major declarations to his name . In the know: True Navy SEALs had been trying to put an end to Dicken's lies but it was too late for a number of investors who helped him launch a security company that took hundreds of thousands of dollars to run . 'He wouldn't tell these outrageous stories just right off the bat,' Carol Roberts told ABC's 20/20 about Dicken. She met him at a military-style training camp that he launched in Carson City, Nevada where she met him. 'He would drop little bits of things that are plausible. And he would tailor that plausibility story to each person, knowing what they knew,' she said. In fact, Dicken had no military history and was a 57-year-old former bartender with a criminal record. His ruse was not just intended to win him some enamored fans but also some serious cash. After launching his training camp, he got the backing of two doctors who were happy to invest in his up-and-coming defense company that he called Global Resources and Logistics. The company went on to win a contract from a group affiliated with the United Nations that was valued at an alleged half-billion dollars. Making a name: Dicken first launched a military-style training camp in Nevada using his alleged 'expertise' from his fake career in the SEALs and the CIA . That meant a big take-home profit for all involved, including the two doctors who invested $850,000 in the company to get it up and running. Dicken asked Ms Roberts to work with him and she agreed to help launch the company and go on their first contracted mission to Burundi after seeing his falsified documents. He had discharge papers- that he printed off the internet- as well as two fraudulent Medals of Honor and a fake email of praise from Col. Oliver North, the former United States Marine Corps Lieutenant Colonel best known for his connection to the Iran Contra scandal. She only began to suspect that something was awry when they arrived in Burundi. On their second night, the power in the hotel went out and Dicken unlike that of an experienced military commander. 'He freaked out, picked up his phone... runs into the other room talking to the CIA to have them reposition his satellite so he can make sure that the rebels aren't coming to get him. He says, ""alpha, bravo, niner, niner, six, two, the fishing is good in Catalina,""' she told 20/20. Trouble brewing: The company that he launched- with the help of $850,000 from investors- took up a contract in Burundi and his employees said his erratic behavior while there sparked their doubts . Digging: It was then that they looked him up online and found this video of actual Navy SEAL Don Shipley who took to the web to vent about all of the lies that Dicken had been spewing . Another American who traveled to Africa with Dicken began questioning the situation once they touched down. 'None of the major players there in Burundi... knew who we were, what we were doing there,' chief pilot Mike Reynolds said to ABC. 'I mean, the stuff he was coming up with is justâ€” it was insane... the whole situation there was dangerous.' It was only then that Roberts and Reynolds began to really dig into Dicken's background and they were not reassured by what they found. Apparently they weren't the first to question his credentials, as a true former Navy SEAL had made it his mission to stop people from believing Dicken's story. Senior Chief Don Shipley runs a similar training camp in Virginia and also fields calls from potential employers looking to verify people who claim to be Navy SEALs. 'I verify, on average, at least 20 fraudulent SEAL claims a day,' Shipley said to ABC. Next problem: Dicken remains in hiding but, because of his prior felony convictions that forbid him from owning firearms, he now faces illegal weapons charges . The Dicken case stuck with him, however, and he got so frustrated by having to continually deny his false claims that Shipley made a video talking to the camera about how angry Dicken's story made him. 'Oh, he says he has got two Medals of Honor, that hasn't happened since World War I... a POW? There's no listing. A.J. has a mental problem, and I go after the worst of the worst.' Shipley said. After seeing the video online, Roberts and Reynolds got back to Nevada and told the investors about Dickenâ€™s true background. Once they began asking questions, Dicken fled- originally to his parentâ€™s house in California and then to a remote part of Alabama- moving whenever a local news affiliate started digging into his claims. It is unclear how he and his former investors have left their relationship, but Dicken still has to deal with pending criminal charges. Once his military background was proved false and his criminal record was found instead, that meant that he could face felony firearm charges since convicted felons are not allowed to own fire arms which is tricky for him as he promoted his training camp with videos of him firing a number of high-powered rifles. When 20/20, which airs the full investigation Friday night, approached Dicken at his rural Alabama home, he refused to comment and said nothing about his web of lies.","A.J.

Fearing for his safety, the RNLI inshore rescue team launched and rescued the first year Aberystwyth University student from the end of the platform. Pictures show the solitary figure standing at the far end of the pier as the water threatens to engulf him. Video taken by a passer-buy shows the waves have cut the man off from the shore and he is stranded at the end of the jetty. Rescue crews used their dinghy to get close to the him then strapped a lifejacket on him and brought him ashore. The RNLI says for the past 24 hours, the coastline and promenade at Aberystwyth has experienced significant damage caused from the strong winds and high tides, resulting in the Environment Agency issuing a severe flood warning and emergency services evacuating residents from properties on the sea front. Despite repeated warnings to the public to stay away from the coastline, the man had walked to the end of the wooden jetty taking photographs of the huge waves breaking against the jetty and across the road at South Marine Terrace. Such was the ferocity of the breaking waves, the man became trapped on the jetty resulting in several 999 calls by members of the public concerned that the manâ€™s life was in danger. Police and coastguard teams were unable to reach the man, and the Aberystwyth RNLI 85 Class lifeboat 'Spirit of Friendship' was launched to assist, reaching the man from the sheltered lee of the harbour.

The man was returned safely to the RNLI boathouse, where police were waiting to provide advice. A . spokesperson for Aberystwyth RNLI Lifeboat said: 'Whilst the extreme . sea conditions are attracting people to the coastline, we repeat our . warning to the public stay safe and to keep away from the shore line and . dangerous waves. 'This incident highlights the dangers posed not only to . the man taking photos, but also the danger that our volunteer crew . members and other emergency services have been placed in rescuing this . man.'

It's been hailed as everything from crazy and creepy to 'like a plot out of Love Actually'. But either way, one woman's mission to track down a man she let get away, mostly thanks to the help of strangers. It all started on December 23 at a bar called The Light Horse in Old Town Alexandria, North Virginia. 'Courtney', who did not want to release her surname, was on a pre-Christmas night out with some girlfriends when she met 'Ben', whose surname she didn't manage to catch. Virginia woman 'Courtney' left 'Ben' at a bar after an amazing time getting to know each other - so she set out to find the mystery man . Courtney met Ben at this bar, The Light Horse in Old Town Alexandria, on December 23, but ran off with some girlfriends without exchanging details . The pair talked about everything - 'religion, faith, morality, culture and how do you define culture in society', according to Courtney. 'Definitely not the things you just randomly talk to someone about in bar!' she told Fox 5. 'It was an extensive conversation in the middle of a DJ playing, a hundred people dancing all around us.' But Courtney messed up. She ran off with her pals and never exchanged details with her potential soul mate. Consumed with regret and uncertainty, Courtney kicked into gear after Christmas - she had to find Ben, whom she described as 'probably early to mid-30s, white male with brown hair, beard, brown eyes, average build, slightly athletic'. She photocopied 75 signs appealing for 'Ben (from the Light Horse)'. Call me!: Courtney said she posted up 60 photocopies of a sign she wrote appealing for Ben to get in touch . Courtney's Twitter account @OldTownCourtney was quickly filled with messages from people wanting to know more about 'this Ben' Courtney also embarked on a few media interviews, hoping that it would help her in her quest to find Ben . 'I made the wrong choice on Dec. 23rd. Call me! Courtney' the signs read, along with her cell phone number. Courtney stuck up 60 of them all over town, mostly down King St, she said. The old-fashioned 'looking for love' notes were coupled with a new-age approach - a Twitter account called @OldTowbCourtney and the hashtag #FindBen. She also conducted a few media interviews, in which she said she 'isn't crazy' and just 'fun and unpredictable'. Thanks to help from strangers who got involved with the search, Courtney received numerous tips as to how to find Ben . Many tried to help Courtney, calling it romantic and re-Tweeting her posts. Others said that Ben should consider legal action. Then, about 2pm on January 2, Courtney Tweeted that she had found Ben. '!I found Ben! To respect Benâ€™s privacy, I wonâ€™t be taking any more interviews. Thank you everyone for the support in my quest to #FindBen !!!' While many outlets, including The Mail Online, have reached out to Courtney to find the ending of her fairytale, she has since shut down her Twitter accounts and switched the cell phone number on her signs to voice mail. The end? Courtney confirmed on Twitter on January 2 that she had indeed found Ben, but refused to elaborate on the outcome of their meeting .","'Courtney' met 'Ben' at The Light Horse in Old Town Alexandria, North Virginia, on December 26, and they 'hit off', talking for hours .

The driver (not pictured) had a three-piece inflatable penile implant fitted by surgeon Dr. Thomas J. Desperito . A truck driver is suing a doctor after he was left with an erection that lasted for eight months and a scrotum the size of a volleyball following penile implant surgery. Daniel Metzgar, 44, had the surgical procedure in 2009.  This week, a medical malpractice lawsuit a heard claims that the surgery had been botched. The Newark truck driver's attorney, Michael C. Heyden, told a court that everyday tasks - such as riding in his motorbike or collecting his newspaper - became a problem for Mr Metzgar as he was 'stuck in this position'. The driver had a three-piece inflatable penile implant fitted by surgeon Dr. Thomas J. Desperito. The urologist fitted inflatable cylinders inside the shaft of the penis, a fluid reservoir under the abdominal wall and a pump inside the scrotum, The News Journal reported. But attorneys for Dr Desperito, who denies responsibility, claim that occasionally bad medical results can occur without it being anyone's fault. They suggested the truck driver should have realised something was wrong when his scrotum swelled to the size of a volleyball after the December surgery. But the 44-year-old did not alert anyone to the problem until April. The prosthesis was eventually removed in August 2010, after tubing from the device punctured his scrotum during a family trip to Niagara Falls . Colleen D. Shields, acting for the . doctor, told the court that her client advised the patient to have the . prosthesis removed after he complained of an infection and that . the erection wasn’t going down, four months after the implant was . fitted. Ms Shields claims that despite the warning, Mr Metzgar did not act for months following the April 2010 visit. The surgical implant most often used involves an inflatable device; two cylinders are placed in the penile tissue and these are connected to a pump in the scrotum. When a man wants to have sex, he squeezes the pump in the scrotum and the cylinders are filled with fluid kept in a reservoir in the abdomen. Penile implants can be: . Penile implants are not usually available on the NHS and inflatable implants are typically expensive. The prosthesis was eventually removed in . August 2010, after tubing from the device punctured his scrotum during a . family trip to Niagara Falls. Metzgar told the court he had become withdrawn and avoided social situations because of his constant erection. 'I could hardly dance, with an erection poking my partner,' he said. The lawsuit brought against Wilmington urologist Dr Desperito is being heard in New Castle County Superior Court in Wilmington this week, NBC Philadelphia reported. Metzgar and his wife, Donna, are seeking unspecified damages from Dr Desperito and his medical group. A penile implant is an inflatable device consisting of two fluid-filled cylinders which are surgically inserted into the penis and connected to a separate reservoir of fluid, and a pump which lies under the skin of the scrotum. The mechanical pump is squeezed to push fluid up the cylinders and, once full, the penis becomes rigid — a process that takes between five and ten seconds. The erection remains until the deflate button is pressed. A penile implant can be used as  a long-term solution for men with severe erectile dysfunction problems caused by a wide range of conditions including diabetes, prostate cancer surgery, Peyronie's disease and age-related vascular disease.","Daniel Metzgar, 44, had the surgical procedure in 2009 but claims it was botched in a medical malpractice lawsuit .

Ray Mears told Radio 4's Desert Island Discs the government plans go against the original idea of the Green Belt . Survival expert Ray Mears is ready to fight for the protection of Britain’s Green Belt in the face of government plans to build more new homes. He says building on the such land is a betrayal of the original idea of preserving the countryside for future generations. The television personality appears on Radio 4’s Desert Island Discs today and tells host Kirsty Young: ‘There is huge pressure to build on the Green Belt. 'As I understood it, that was put aside in perpetuity by our ancestors, our elders, and I think it should still be so.’ He accepts the need to build new homes, but adds: ‘If we don’t have green spaces, what sort of people do we become living in those houses?’ The Green Belt began as a policy for controlling urban growth in the 1940s and 1950s and was encouraged by local and central government. Mears, 49, also talks about how he used his bushcraft skills to help track down fugitive killer Raoul Moat, who went on a shooting spree after he was released from prison in 2010, sparking one of Britain’s largest ever manhunts. And he recalls the pain of the death of his first wife Rachel in 2006, then being ‘knocked off his feet’ when he met second wife Ruth 18 months later.

Thousands of people have driven past this mansion over the years and looked at its impressive exterior. But few could have imagined the secrets which the 18th Century building holds inside. The mansion, called  The Hermitage, in Northumberland, has been described as the house 'that time forgot'. Antiques: Items untouched for almost 100 years were discovered amongst the 28 rooms in 18th Century mansion The Hermitage in Hexham, Northumberland . Secrets: The cellars of the house included  unopened Champagne bottles from 1919, some in their original tissue paper, and wine from 1914 . Impressive: Thousands of people would have driven past this stunning house over the years, but few could have guessed about its treasures inside . When auctioneers entered the home recently they discovered a treasure trove of antiques dating back 100 years. Wine from 1914 was discovered along with Champagne from 1919. They also discovered a copy of a 1938  magazine as well as family photographs spanning almost 100 years. Andrew McCoull, managing director of Newcastle based auction house Anderson & Garland, said: 'Time had stood still and the house took on the qualities of a museum. It was a once-in-a-career experience. 'The Hermitage must be one of Hexham's most important and certainly the most hidden home. Thousands will have driven past its entrance, totally oblivious of this fine mansion house. 'The children's toys in the nursery had been left intact. There were christening gowns and rattles sent from London, and charts kept by the children's nanny. 'In the cellars were unopened Champagne bottles from 1919, some in their original tissue paper and packing cases, and 1914 wine. 'Cosmetics and pharmaceutical items, from the 1920s and 1940s, crowded the medicine cupboard. There were diaries and household accounts giving insights into a bygone age of servants, while fishing and hunting records spoke of house parties.

'In the main bedroom there were wash bowl sets and rooms had wallpaper from the 1920s and 1930s.' The house had been let by owners the Allgood family in 1922 to Brigadier General Hubert Horatio Morant, who had married Isabella Helen Coppin Straker in 1914. Their three children, Doreen Shirley, who died earlier this year, Alice Bettine, who died in 2008, and Major John Locke Straker, who passed away in 1971, all remained unmarried. The contents of the house on the edge of Hexham, described by Mr McCoull as a 'treasure trove', will be auctioned in 1,500 lots at Anderson & Garland's Newcastle base from June 18-21.

'What was striking was the enormity of it all, the sheer quantity of memorabilia . and ephemera which would normally have been thrown out and which told . how a family in the inter-war years lived, and what they did,' said Mr McCoull. 'The Hermitage is a rare survival of a house on a grand scale where the Morant family lived for 90 years and threw little away. 'Items no longer required were neatly wrapped in newspaper, tied with string and stored in the extensive attics. The contents offer us a rare glimpse of life in the inter-war period. 'Only once in a career are you fortunate enough to see a home such as this which has been inhabited but - highly unusually - also left alone to this extent. 'With the sheer scale of the property, the family's possessions could be stored in different cupboards, rooms, lofts and buildings and little was ever disposed of. 'As such, stepping into The Hermitage has been like stepping back in time. The sisters were characters and involved in the community.' Simon Morant, a cousin of the family, said: 'Following the death of Brigadier General Morant and his wife, their son and two daughters stayed at the property until they also died. 'I knew the two Miss Morants, Doreen and Bettine, and had the opportunity to go around the property. That said, even I was not aware to what extent their goods and belongings had accumulated. 'We have taken some of the more poignant things from the estate, including letters from 1840 between my family and theirs, but we very much hope that the remainder of the belongings go somewhere where they will be appreciated.'","Auctioneers discovered a treasure trove of antiques inside The Hermitage .

The dismissals started early this year, with the news that the Cleveland Browns would not be keeping coach Rob Chudzinski being released late last night. As Monday morning dawned, two other coaches expected to be fired joined Chudzinksi on the unemployment line. The Minnesota Vikings fired head coach Leslie Frazier and the Washington Redskins sacked head coach and Executive Vice President Mike Shanahan. Shanahan was among those expected to be out of the job for the way he dealt with quarterback Robert Griffin III's ACL injury last season. Bad move: Redskins head coach Mike Shanahan was expected to lose his job for the way he dealt with quarterback Robert Griffin III's leg injury.

A controversial plan for Tory and UKIP supporters to ‘swap votes’ to keep Ed Miliband out of No 10 and ensure Britain gets the chance to leave the European Union has been launched by writer and political campaigner Toby Young. His ‘Country Before Party’ scheme aims to stop UKIP robbing the Tories of the Commons seats they need to defeat Labour in the next Election. Mr Young claims it would give UKIP leader Nigel Farage and a handful of his candidates a chance of winning seats. Swap: David Cameron, left, could find it easier to retain Downing Street if UKIP supporters agree to vote Tory in key seats. In return, Conservative voters in other areas could support UKIP, led by Nigel Farage (right) He plans to set up a website  to enable UKIP and Tory supporters in different constituencies to pledge to ‘exchange votes’. Polling experts last night cast doubt on whether the scheme could work, given the Tories had more to gain than UKIP. But Tory-supporting Mr Young, who has won praise  for setting up a free school in London, says he is determined to give it a try. He said: ‘Whatever their party allegiances, most people are in favour of a referendum on the EU. But the Tory-UKIP split could let Ed Miliband into Downing Street. And he’s said that unless circumstances change he will not allow a vote on our future in Europe.’ John Curtice, professor of politics at the University of Strathclyde, said: ‘Such a scheme could only hope to make a significant difference to the composition of the next House of Commons if the Election race were much closer than it is at present. ‘It could prove nigh impossible to find even a dozen seats in which sufficient Tory voters could be persuaded to switch to UKIP.

A former Tory Minister who is now a key adviser to Boris Johnson has branded the Government sexist after it said adverts for top public sector jobs should be dumbed down to encourage women applicants. Ex-Treasury Minister Angela Knight attacked the ‘action plan’ issued by the Cabinet Office which says public sector bodies should be ‘simplifying adverts and using language which will encourage candidates’. The document adds: ‘Job adverts and specifications [should] use plain English and avoid jargon to appeal to the widest field of applicants.’ Ex-Treasury Minister Angela Knight attacked the 'action plan' issued by the Cabinet Office which says public sector bodies should be 'simplifying adverts and using language which will encourage candidates' Mrs Knight, who has positions in both public and private sector boardrooms, said: ‘I am all in favour of equal opportunities and there is certainly some evidence from the City that women on boards improve company performance. ‘But I don’t think things need to be made simple just so women can get their heads around things. I think organisations should use plain English to attract the right candidates regardless of gender.’ Mrs Knight, 63, sits on the board of Transport for London, a public body which Mr Johnson chairs. She is also chief executive of Energy UK, the industry body for Britain’s biggest power firms. Mrs Knight added: ‘None of my jobs have been traditionally “female”, so I can honestly say it makes no difference to me  if my colleagues are male or female. In the end, it’s ability that counts.’ Sarah Wollaston, Tory MP for Totnes, also criticised the plan and asked for the document to be reworded. The guidelines have been published by the Centre for Public Appointments (CPA). Its job is to meet the Government’s target of ensuring that half of all senior posts within Government and public sector organisations are filled by women by 2015. But despite the criticism from Mrs Knight and Ms Wollaston, some female business leaders support the action plan. The document adds: 'Job adverts and specifications [should] use plain English and avoid jargon to appeal to the widest field of applicants' Fiona Hathorn, of independent pressure group Women On Board, said: ‘Top women are being put off when it comes to applying for roles by job advertisements laden with historic public sector jargon.’ The CPA works with the Commissioner for Public Appointments to encourage more women in boardrooms. Commissioner Sir David Normington’s report for 2012-13 paints a rather bleak picture  of public sector appointments for women. In 2001, 39 per cent of appointments were made to women. But in 2012-13, that figure had dropped to 35.6 per cent. The Cabinet Office’s own figures for 2012-13, show that most Government departments have failed to reach the equality target. Departments such as the Ministry of Defence had women filling only 17 per cent of vacancies, while the Department for Transport fared even worse at 16 per cent. The Cabinet Office last night denied its action plan was patronising towards women. It said: ‘As part of our wider work to reform Whitehall, we want job advertisements to be clear and free of jargon. 'This is good practice in business. It is simply not true to suggest we are dumbing down for women.’","Cabinet Office said  should use 'language which will encourage candidates’

This is the first picture of the cyclist shot dead  in the French Alps along with three members of a British family in a horrific quadruple murder. It features in a French television documentary to be screened today about the still-unsolved killings in a forest lay-by near Lake Annecy in September 2012. The cyclist, Sylvain Mollier, 45, was shot seven times by a pistol-wielding assassin. Nearby, three occupants of a BMW car, Saad  al-Hilli, 50, his wife Iqbal, 47, and her mother, Suhaila al-Allaf, 74, were also killed. Each was shot three times. The al-Hillis’ two young daughters, Zeena and Zainab, survived and are now in the care of immediate family in England. The Anglo-French inquiry into the crimes continues to presume that the British family, from Claygate, Surrey, were the intended target of the gunman but there have been claims that it might have been Frenchman Mollier. Detectives have focused on a dispute Saad  al-Hilli had with his brother, 54-year-old Zaid, over their father’s inheritance. While every detail of the al-Hillis’ lives has been made public by the French and openly analysed by prosecutors and police, little has been disclosed about Mollier. This has prompted the makers of today’s documentary, entitled Non Elucidé (Unresolved), to show the photo and publish it on the internet. Zaid Al-Hilli, a payroll manager from Chessington, Surrey, was arrested last year, but provided an alibi which was confirmed by police. Officers have also discounted claims that he made a number of calls to Romania to hire a hitman. Zaid is convinced Mollier was the real target, saying last October: ‘They are covering up for someone in France in that region and they know it. There is something more to it locally.’ Murder scene: Investigators examine the car in which Said Al-Hilli was killed along with with his wife Iqbal, 47, and her mother, Suhaila al-Allaf, 74 . Despite the remarks, gendarme commander Lieutenant Colonel Benoît Vinnemann insisted last night that Zaid ‘had a motive’ and that Mollier was unlikely to have been the principal target. Meanwhile, Annecy prosecutor Eric Maillaud has admitted that the investigation has been scaled down, and that there are unlikely to be any more appeals for information in the near future - provoking anger from some of those linked to the case.","Mr Mollier was shot seven times along with three members of a British family .

"By . Sarah Oliver . PUBLISHED: . 17:00 EST, 4 January 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 18:06 EST, 4 January 2014 . Susan Forgie lives in a converted barn set amid eight-and-a-half acres of gently undulating limestone hills which straddle the ancient border of England and Wales. When she put her home on the market, more than 250 families asked her estate agent for details. Ultimately, none would come to view. Mrs Forgie – 63, and widowed in 2011 – has had to take The Old Barn in Maesbrook, Oswestry, Shropshire, off the market. Today her five-bedroomed property is as much a prison as a home because it stands on the potential path of a new line of high-voltage electricity pylons servicing a future cluster of wind farms in mid-Wales. Even at a knockdown price, she cannot sell. Soon but a memory: This Lake District view is set to be no more when several 400,000-volt pylons is set up across the landscape . She is entitled to compensation from neither National Grid, the company behind the pylon line, or the Government, that has pledged to generate 15 per cent of the UK’s power from renewable sources  by 2020. It is a small human tragedy being played out against the backdrop of one of the major issues of the 21st Century – keeping Britain’s lights on. And it is being replicated across the country as the demand for a cleaner, greener future threatens to turn the UK into what one campaigner has dubbed ‘pylon island’. An ugly army of 400,000-volt pylons is set to march across some of Britain’s most beautiful landscapes. They are necessary to plug energy from wind turbines, new nuclear power stations and even the Continent into the National Grid. Lines in Somerset, the Essex-Suffolk border and Mid Wales are ready to be put forward for planning consent, while one in Kent is not far behind. Lines in North Wales and on the North-West coast are still to have their exact routes settled. The most advanced is the Scottish line already under construction. The least, needed for the 2020s, is to bring wind energy ashore from turbines off the East Anglian coast. But the giant pylons – some behemoths up to 213ft tall – will trap homeowners in blighted or unsellable homes, damage tourism-based businesses and spoil historic views. Areas under threat include the Highlands of Scotland, the southern gateway to the Lake District, the Somerset Levels, and the East Anglian countryside which inspired old masters Constable and Gainsborough. This new front in the battle to keep Britain at full power could have political repercussions in the run up to the 2015 General Election. Local communities, led by a cross-party band of MPs including Tory Dr Liam Fox and Lib Dem Tessa Munt, accuse the Coalition of treating them as collateral damage in the race for renewables and a low-carbon future. Last week, Sir Andrew Motion, president of the Campaign to Protect Rural England – which has the Queen as patron – stepped up the political pressure with an attack on all three parties. He accused the Coalition and the Opposition of embracing energy policies which permit wind and solar farms to ‘industrialise the countryside they set out to preserve’. The group forecasts that more than 200 miles of new pylons could blight England and Wales in the next decade. Added to that total is a project which dwarfs them all: in Scotland, a 137-mile power line is already under construction between Beauly, ten miles west of Inverness, and Denny near Falkirk to the south. Among those who spoke of its devastating consequences of the SSE project was former Scottish rugby international Kenny Logan, who is married to TV presenter Gabby Logan. The Logan family farms in the shadow of the world famous monument to Braveheart hero William Wallace at Abbey Craig near Stirling, past which the line crosses. Anti pylon: Former rugby player Kenny Logan and TV presenter wife Gabby . ‘They should be proud of this land and the Scottish heritage it represents – instead they are tearing it up,’ says clan matriarch Elizabeth Logan, 81. That was a battle lost in the war on super-pylons but others, notably in mid Wales, Somerset and Suffolk, are still being fought. North Somerset MP Dr Fox is in the vanguard demanding a coherent response from National Grid and the Government. He said: ‘We need to accept that the cost of pylons is measured not just in money but in the loss of our countryside. 'National Grid is so obsessed with the short term and pleasing its shareholders that it is clinging to old technologies instead of investing in new ones which could remove the scar of pylons for the next generation. ‘And they have a human cost. They blight the homes of those in their way and destroy the one thing country dwellers cherish more than any other – the beauty of the natural landscape. ‘No one wants Britain’s lights to go out, we all need electricity, but those unaffected by this issue close their eyes to it. Pylons were invented three quarters of a century ago: are they really still the best we can do?’ According to National Grid, the answer is yes. It favours pylons because of the significant saving compared to running power lines underground or sinking them offshore. A 2012 report commissioned by National Grid and the Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC), which was endorsed by the Institution of Engineering and Technology, concludes that a pylon line costs between £2.2 million and £4.2million per kilometre, whereas the cheapest undergrounding option costs between £10.2 million and £24.1 million for the same stretch. The company highlights its environmental work to mitigate the effects of pylons – using topography and woodland to mask them – and  its planned undergrounding in sensitive areas such as East Anglia’s Dedham Vale. It is pledging to use some new  ‘T’ shaped pylons, which are 50ft shorter than the traditional ‘A’ frame, and points out a line of super-pylons can give a net reduction  in the number of pylons in an area such as Somerset, where 90 small 132-kilovolt pylons will be dismantled to make way for their bigger 400kv cousins. A National Grid spokesman said: ‘These new connections are essential to keep the lights on and maintain our way of life. We plan routes away from homes and, where appropriate, use underground cables or the innovative new T-pylon design. We understand the local impact and we want to work with communities to reduce this, while also managing the cost paid by everyone through their energy bills. Ultimately it is the Government who decide whether we have got the balance right through the planning process.’ But unlike victims of other major national infrastructure projects, such as the new high speed rail link HS2, families and businesses in the path of these pylons receive no compensation unless a pylon is actually on their land. There is no payout for proximity, despite the visual blight and impact on house prices,  estimated at 30 to 40 per cent by campaigners. Mother-of-three Megan Rathbone lives in a Georgian farmhouse with holiday lets in a rural area threatened by a proposed pylon line near Wrexham in North Wales. It’s not a National Grid scheme but a private company’s connection from a proposed gas-fired power station. Power to the people: The expansion of the 'pylon army' is necessary to plug energy from wind turbines, new nuclear power stations and even the Continent into the National Grid . The DECC told her bluntly: ‘HS2 will have different impacts to transmission network infrastructure and mitigation measures are different.’ The high-speed rail link, it confirms, ‘does not set a precedent’. Yet farmer and butcher James Ward, 53, who lives with wife Janet and their two children in Berghill Farmhouse in Oswestry – where pylons from National Grid’s Mid Wales connection could pass as close as 165ft away – says: ‘This has already ruined our life and potentially our livelihood.’ The scheme has ‘scuppered’ a business plan for diversification into free-range sausages and home-cured bacon, and to develop disused buildings on the farm. ‘We invested heavily and got planning permission for four dwellings in redundant barns,’ he said. ‘We developed one and moved into it ourselves. The sale of the old farmhouse was meant to be the last piece of the jigsaw. ‘It was on the market for £445,000 and was getting real interest but as soon as the path of the pylons was announced all the viewings stopped. The estate agent advised us to take it off the market as it is unsellable. ‘We have borrowed heavily and selling the farmhouse was an essential part of our plan. Financially, this could finish us – the pylons have made our assets worthless.’ In Wales’ Vyrnwy Valley in Montgomeryshire, Rhisiart Owen, 67, and his wife Hilary, 65, live in a Grade II* listed 1612 house restored under the eye of a Oxford university specialist over seven years. They are also victims of the so-called wind-rush, which they estimate has knocked at least 25 per cent off the value of their home. Their house could have a pylon just 200ft away with the couple having to go under power lines to reach their front door. Mr Owen said: ‘We wanted this house to be as it was 400 years ago. How can having a pylon so close to a heritage site  be justifiable?’ In Somerset, David Shepherd, 56, tells a similar story. He lives at Tarnock Farm, Axbridge, where he expects a pylon about 260ft from his home. ‘My wife and I were planning to move soon as our children are growing up. But houses nearby have stopped selling. So we are trapped in this house which will, by 2019, look out on to a huge pylon with 100ft of cables buzzing over us. We also have a little holiday cottage on our land but people come for unspoilt views, not to stare out on to a pylon. We feel helpless.’ As Liam Fox says: ‘The majority of the electricity transmitted along super-pylons is destined for urban centres, not the rural communities which suffer the greatest impact. ‘Everyone should share the costs over the long term – a few pennies per quarter – to put new power cables underground.’ For now, however, it is the minority who must pay the price. ‘It is a betrayal of ordinary people and unspoiled countryside,’ says Megan Rathbone. ‘We’re supposed to be a green and pleasant land – soon we’ll be green and pyloned.’ Additional reporting: Hannah Ellis-Petersen .","Several areas in Britain will see electric pylons installed .

Elisabetta and Francesca Grillo could face a probe themselves into tax on gifts such as luxury handbags and holidays. Investigation: Charles Saatchi and Nigella Lawson (pictured before their divorce) may be investigated by HMRC, reports suggest . The latest news comes days after Nigella made her first public appearance to promote television show The Taste. Appearing in an interview on ABC News in America, the domestic goddess said she had 'binged on chocolate' following her 'mortifying court appearance'. She added her New Year's resolution was to get back into shape and 'listen to loud disco music' while working out. She said: ‘I’ve been incredibly lazy. So it’s back to the treadmill. ‘But with loud disco music and thinking about what I’ll eat for supper, it’s fine.’ The Taste was aired in America last night and will be on British screens this Tuesday. Gifts: In a trial last year, Elisabetta Grillo, 32, (left) and her sister Francesca, 34, former employees of Saatchi and Nigella, claimed the domestic goddess let them spend thousands of pounds on gifts . Today, tax specialist Jason Collins explained in The Telegraph how if an employer gives their employee anything that is not strictly needed for their work  - such as luxury holidays and wedding receptions as it was implied in the Grillo's trial last year - it should be declared as a taxable benefit. Gifts or presents should be declared as part of the employee's income and national insurance should also be paid at 13,8 per cent, he said. He said: 'If an employer provides an employee with anything that is not specifically needed for their work, that is counted as a taxable benefits. 'So if an employer pays for an employee to go on holiday on their own, or pays for the cost of a wedding reception, as was mentioned in the trial, that should be declared as part of the employee’s income and national insurance contributions are payable by the employer at 13.8 per cent. New start: Nigella made her first public appearance since the 'mortifying' trail this week to promote new show The Taste (cast pictured) 'Not only that, but the value of the gift must be converted into gross salary, so if someone is in the 40 per cent tax band and their employer pays for a wedding reception that costs £12,000, that would have to be declared as £20,000 of income for tax purposes.' He said it was up to the employee to ensure they paid the correct income tax. A spokesman for HMRC said: 'We don't discuss specific tax affairs but in general the rules say that when you benefit from something provided to you by your employer there may be a tax charge. 'National Insurance Contributions might also be due. Anyone in any doubt can use the guidance on our website to check the position.' The Grillo sisters were paid by art tycoon Saatchi and had company credit cards for his art trading company Conarco. In the trial held at Isleworth Crown Court, the pair said Nigella let them spend thousands on holidays, clothing and other gifts as 'thank yous'. The art tycoon said he paid off the cards every month and did not check what the money was being spent on. Both Mr Saatchi and Miss Lawson have been contacted for comment.","Couple's accounts may be looked into by HM Revenue and Customs .

Fast-acting: David Baines foiled a $1million robbery at a jewellery store on the Cayman Islands, on the same day as he was awarded an OBE . A former Manchester police chief foiled a $1million jewellery robbery in the Cayman Islands, ramming his car into the getaway vehicle, on the same day he was made an OBE. David Baines was meeting a friend outside a jewellery store on the Caribbean islands, when armed raiders struck. The 53-year-old spotted three men running from the shop, jumping into a getaway vehicle. But Mr Baines thwarted their attempts to escape, ramming his car into the fleeing vehicle before arresting two suspects. It came on the same day as the former Salford officer was honoured in the New Year's Honours List. Mr Baines, who has been Commissioner of the Royal Cayman Islands Police Service since 2009, was in George Town, the islands capital, when the drama unfolded on New Year's Day. He said: 'I was in George Town to meet my friend and former colleague, Bob Helm, a former chief detective with Lancashire Police. 'He had arrived on a cruise ship and we were meeting to spend a few days together. The arrangement was to rendezvous near the port outside a jewellery shop called Diamonds International. 'Bob was in a shop nearby buying champagne to celebrate the New Year and I was outside the store waiting for him which is why I was in the right place at the right time. 'As I arrived I saw a security guy running out of Diamonds International looking concerned. 'As I looked into the shop I could see at least two masked men.' Mr Baines said he spun his Chevrolet Trailblazer around and saw three men running from the store and getting into a getaway vehicle. 'I rammed the car to try and block them. I was partially successful,' he said. 'They climbed out of the car and started running so I went after them and hit two of the guys up against a fence. One slipped beneath the car.' Members of the public grappled with the two suspects pinned by Mr Baines' car. Shots were fired during the robbery but no one was hurt as a result of the shooting. But one of the suspects was injured during his arrest. Armed robbery: Raiders targeted the Diamonds International store in George Town, pictured above, smashing 40 glass cabinets and making off with $1million of gems. The haul was recovered later after Mr Baines rammed his truck into the getaway car, arresting two suspects . Forty display cases were smashed during the robbery and gems worth $1million stolen - but it was recovered nearby. Mr Baines said: 'I did my job; it's as simple as that. I only did what I would expect any officer of the RCIPS to do. 'This demonstrates the great community spirit in the Cayman Islands and the selfless acts we see time and time again where members of the public step forward to stand up for what is right.' A firearm was also recovered from the scene. Mr Baines made national headlines in 2005 when he said Salford was over run with 'feral youths'. He spoke out after a spate of assaults, including an attack on a father-of-four who was left fighting for his life after being confronted by youths outside his home in Lower Broughton. At the time Mr Baines said: 'There are gangs of feral youths who are under no control from adults, parents or anyone else, who intimidate people living in the area, often fuelled by alcohol.' He left Greater Manchester Police in 2006 to become assistant chief constable at Cheshire Police. He started his career as a cadet with Lancashire Police in 1976 and was a detective for 17 years. He worked as a divisional commander for Oldham before moving to Salford.","David Baines was meeting a friend when he spotted the armed robbery .

At least 30 people have been killed when a bus veered off a mountain road and plunged 120 meters down into a rocky gorge, police in India said today. The driver lost control of the bus after it collided with a lorry on a road near Malshej Ghat - a hilly tourist spot about 100 miles north-east of Mumbai in the western state of Maharashtra. The bus, carrying 40 people, then plunged down the side of the mountain and into the gorge 120 metres below on Thursday afternoon.

Green campaigners have urged the Government not to 'gamble' with England's natural heritage by allowing developers to destroy the UK's ancient woodland. Environment Secretary Owen Paterson sparked anger after defending the 'biodiversity offsetting' scheme he plans to introduce. It would allow developers to compensate for the destruction of habitats by creating or enhancing other natural areas by agreeing to plant 100 trees for each one felled. Woodland scene: Burnham Beeches in Buckingshire. There are 380 ancient woodlands in the UK under threat from projects including the HS2 high-speed rail line . Mr Paterson told The Times the policy could be applied to woods dating back more than 400 years - around a third of all woodland in England. While destroying mature trees was a 'tragic loss', replacing each with 100 new ones would 'deliver a better environment over the long term', he said. Defra said any move to build on ancient woodland would be restricted to major projects and would only get planning permission in exceptional cases. Mr Paterson conceded that the present generation of UK residents would lose out and that replacement sites could be up to an hour away by car. Dartmoor national Park: 'It's the quality of forests that's important, not just the quantity of trees,' says Friends of the Earth nature campaigner Paul de Zylva . But he insisted the initiative - designed to ease the construction of homes, roads and major projects - would result in an 'enormous increase' in trees. 'The point about offsetting is it will deliver a better environment over the long term,' he told the newspaper. Under fire: Environment Minister Owen Patterson . He signalled that he would like to see offsetting become compulsory to encourage a market of sites that could be improved. That was one recommendation of a report by the Commons Environmental Audit Committee which also raised serious concerns. It said the proposed system was too simplistic to take into account the full value of the lost sites and a full assessment of pilot projects was required. While speeding up development was welcome, there was a risk developers were given 'carte blanche' to concrete over valuable habitats, it concluded. The report specifically highlighted fears ancient woodland and Sites of Special Scientific Interest would not be adequately protected. Friends of the Earth nature campaigner Paul de Zylva said including ancient woodlands 'highlights the absurdity' of the policy. 'It's the quality of forests that's important, not just the quantity of trees. 'Ministers should be protecting nature, instead of gambling with it by allowing Britain's best wildlife sites to be shifted around the country. 'The Government's mad cap biodiversity offsetting plans should get the chop - not our forests.' The Woodland Trust said more than 380 ancient woods were already under threat from projects including the HS2 high-speed rail line. Offsetting should only be used as a 'last resort', policy director Hilary Allison told The Times - criticising Mr Paterson's suggestion that an hour's journey by car would be close enough to do compensatory work. Beauty of The New Forest: The National Trust said 'irreplaceable' habitats must be excluded from government policy . 'It is critical that any habitats created to compensate for loss are placed within the local area that suffered the original impact,' she said. 'Unfortunately, this still appears open to debate.' Three years ago, Mr Paterson's predecessor Caroline Spelman was forced by public outcry into an embarrassing U-turn on plans to sell off England's public forests. Campaigners are now warning that they too could be under threat again in the form of plans to introduce a new management organisation to 'own and manage the Public Forest Estate'. Defra insists there are no plans to sell or privatise England's forests following the establishment of the new arrangements. The National Trust said 'irreplaceable' habitats must be excluded from the policy and said it was 'deeply . concerned' at any suggestion otherwise which appeared to go beyond . previous proposals. Conserving and protecting ancient and . historic woodland is one of its charitable purposes. 'Offsetting the losses of wildlife . that usually accompany development by creating replacement habitats could be a . useful addition to the planning system,' a spokesman said. 'But it mustn't mean mature . irreplaceable habitats being replaced by low-quality habitats that will take . decades to develop the character and complexity of those that have been lost. 'There will be some habitats that are . effectively irreplaceable and should not be part of any offsetting scheme.'","Owen Patterson claims government scheme would deliver a 'better environment over the long term'

This house might feature phantom footsteps, a howling poltergeist and ghostly reflections in the bathroom mirror, but at least you won't be spooked by its price tag. Gregory Leeson has put his Marion Street, Pennsylvania home on the market  for just $144,000 - and he has assured potential buyers it's not so eerie. 'Slightly haunted. Nothing serious, though. e.g. The sounds of phantom footsteps. A strange knocking sound followed by a very quiet (hardly noticeable, even) scream at 3:13am, maybe once a week. Twice a week, tops,' the property listing on real estate website, Zillow, says. 'And the occasional ghastly visage lurking behind you in the bathroom mirror. Even still, this occurs very rarely and only in the second floor bathroom.' 'Slightly haunted': This possessed 1901 Victorian house at 1217 Marion St house in Dunmore, Pennsylvania (center) is on the market for $144,000 . Packed with poltergeists: Gregory Leeson has put his Marion Street, Pennsylvania home on the market for just $144,000 - and he has assured potential buyers it's not so creepy . And it gets creepier. Leeson described occasionally hearing voices in his daughter’s room when she was an infant. 'It . sounded like there was a person in the room with her talking. We’d go . in, and she was just sitting there. But she normally cried constantly,' he said. Even though Philadelphia law doesn't require that Leeson disclose a haunting, he decided it would be fair to be upfront. And his honesty seems to have paid off. Leeson said he has been inundated with queries since listing the four bedroom property, which was built in 1901, about six days ago. 'When I was writing it, I had been thinking about it, and I went back and forth,' he told Zillow. 'The way I worded it — I was trying to keep it light. I have been reading online, and people saying you are supposed to disclose it. I don’t know the laws here, but thought better safe than sorry. 'I’ve gotten a lot of offers. I guess any publicity is good publicity. I think it’s helping in the long run. It’s a nice house. If it’s getting it out there and a buyer likes the house, they probably won’t be dissuaded.' However, 'scientifically minded' Leeson isn’t entirely convinced his 3,367-square-foot home is haunted. 'Doors slam shut, but it’s an old house. It’s not that often. I used to have roommates, and my wife’s friend . swears the house is possessed. I have other friends that come over and . say it’s the most calming house they’ve been in,' he said. Buyer beware: The seller says you may find 'the occasional ghastly visage lurking behind you in the bathroom mirror. Even still, this occurs very rarely and only in the second floor bathroom' (pictured) Eerie: The sounds of phantom footsteps can be heard on the staircase and throughout the haunted house . Although the spine-tingling property is not for the fainthearted, lovers of the paranormal may consider the home a steal. According to the listing, the spacious home boasts stain-glass windows, a study/library with a secret door behind a moving bookcase which leads into a small office, a large crawl space behind a concealed door hidden in a bedroom closet and a basement with a wet bar. For some buyers, the supernatural activity may be an added extra. A recent survey by realtor.com found that more than half of home buyers are open to purchasing a haunted house. About 35 percent of the nearly 1,400 respondents said they have lived in a haunted home. 'When purchasing a home, buyers want to know what they are getting into and that includes anything potentially spooky,' Alison Schwartz, vice president of corporate communications for Move Inc., which operates realtor.com, told NBC News. 'Our data reveals that while the majority of consumers are open to purchasing a haunted home, many buyers conduct research on a home’s history to be aware of any weird incidences.' But, she added, while some people 'are willing to purchase a haunted home at a discounted price, many say levitating objects, ghost sightings and objects moving from one place to another would deter them from purchasing a home.' The hand that rocks the cradle: Gregory Leeson's listing has prompted interest from would-be ghost hunters who have no trouble sleeping in a haunted house . While you were sleeping: Leeson said a woman's 'hardly noticeable' scream could be heard at least once a week at about at 3.13am .

A team was immediately deployed to a park by Prince of Wales Mansions in Harrogate - but the victims were nowhere to be found.

The family of Menachem Stark, 40, offered a $100,000 'no questions asked' reward for his safe return on Friday, as police combed through surveillance video that appears to show his abduction. Officers say the incident happened at around 11.20pm, when Stark was grabbed by two men on Rutledge Street in South Williamsburg. Some reports suggest he was carrying $4,000 in cash. Missing: Police are looking for Jewish Orthodox real estate developer Menachem Stark, who was allegedly kidnapped from outside his office in Willliamsburg on Thursday night . Hunt: Police and the Willliamsburg community are looking for clues on the light-colored Dodge minivan (circled) which Stark appears to have been bundled into . DNA Info reported that Stark was approached and manhandled into a light-colored van by two men as he left his office at Southside Associates at 331 Rutledge Street. His wife Bashie apparently became concerned when Stark did not return after midnight and contacted Shomrim, a neighborhood patrol group for the Orthodox community. Surveillance footage was then discovered in Stark's office that shows a struggle with one man, before the van pulls up and he is wrestled by two men into the vehicle. Stark's brothers Yitzy and Yoely told the New York Post: 'We saw two people fighting with him, and they put him into a big white van, a Dodge Caravan,' Yitzy, 30, said. Investigations: The incident is being looked into by the police and the Shomrim, a neighborhood patrol group for the Orthodox community, who produced this report . The brothers described Menachem's alleged attackers to the Post as 'big' and 'black.' The New York Daily News reported that Stark was carrying $4,000 in cash, but Yitzy Stark denied this when he offered the six-figure reward for his brother's return. 'We're waiting for a phone call with demands. [We're] just hoping that he is still alive,' Yitzy told DNA Info. 'We'll do anything they ask.' Shomrim reportedly informed the NYPD of the incident at around 2.30 a.m. on Friday. Both the police and the community are now looking for clues on the white Dodge minivan. Officials spent the day in the local area conducting interviews and reviewing surveillance footage from local businesses. The Real Deal claimed that Stark, and associate Israel Perlmutter, were being sued more than $51 million in 2011, over loans for development projects in Williamsburg and Greenpoint.

Dramatic video footage has captured the moment a father smashed into a car at the end of a 102mph police chase, fleeing the vehicle leaving his three children in the back seat. Jason Thomas is seen weaving in and out of traffic on the M5 near Worcester, reaching deadly speeds before flying down the hard shoulder. The 33-year-old had just picked his children up from school on September 30 last year, when he was pursued by traffic officers. The video, captured by the police, shows Thomas racing through a red light and smashing his silver Vauxhall Vectra into an oncoming car. He is then seen jumping out of the car in an attempt to flee the scene on foot, abandoning his three screaming children, who were left in the back seat. Officers wrestled the father to the ground as he ran across a dual carriageway. Thomas was jailed for 22 months after admitting dangerous driving at Worcester Crown Court. Judge Michael Cullum said Thomas had put the lives of 'hundreds' of people at risk. He told him: 'The high speed while undertaking on the hard shoulder is shocking. 'All the while, you were putting at risk of serious injury or worse, hundreds of people. 'In some ways, the most shocking thing about the whole episode was when, having crashed, the rear door of your vehicle opened and out stretched the arm of your young child. 'What sort of person drives like that with their own three children and their partner in that vehicle?' Scroll down for video . Traffic police flashed Thomas, to signal to him that they wanted the 33-year-old to pull over . Instead of pulling over, the father led police on a chase reaching speeds of 102mph . Weaving in and out of cars, Thomas repeatedly flew down the hard shoulder in his silver Vauxhall Vectra . In his bid to get away, the 33-year-old careered through a set of red lights, colliding a car crossing the junction in the opposite direction . Sentencing Thomas, the judge said he had put the lives of 'hundreds' of people at risk . 'You didn’t wait to see how the people in the other vehicle were - you didn’t care about that. 'You even ran away from your own family.' Police flashed their lights at Thomas and indicated for him to stop. The two-minute recording shows the Vectra tearing up the M5 near Worcester, dodging cars and attempting to run the chasing police car off the road. Thomas leaves the motorway at junction four, where he hurtles along country lanes near Hagley, north Worcestershire. After smashing into the back of another car, injuring an 80-year-old woman inside, Thomas jumped out of the car, fleeing on foot across a dual carriageway . As he fled, officers spotted the arm of a child from inside the car, discovering Thomas had abandoned his three children on the back seat . Officers detained Thomas 20 yards from his car. The 33-year-old admitted dangerous driving and was jailed for 22 months. It emerged it was his sixth conviction for dangerous driving and the 12th time he had been caught driving while he was disqualified . But just a few seconds later the children’s ordeal was over as Thomas slammed into the side of a Toyota, carrying a man with his 80-year-old mother - who was hurt in the crash. Thomas, from Dudley, tried to flee on foot, but officers detained him 20 yards from his wrecked car. The court heard it was Thomas’s sixth conviction for dangerous driving, and that Thomas was already driving whilst disqualified and without insurance. He also had 11 previous convictions for driving while disqualified. Thomas was jailed for 18 months for dangerous driving and four months consecutively for driving while disqualified.

An inquisitive teenager on a school trip may have inadvertently captured an image of a ghost claimed to be a noblewoman once tipped to take the throne after Queen Elizabeth I. Cameron Hamilton took a photograph of an arch at Rufford Abbey Country Park with his iPod Touch, only to spot later it contained a misty white figure. Nottinghamshire County Council staff believe it is the ghostly White Lady of Rufford who, according to legend, is believed to be the spirit of ill-fated Arbella Stuart. Is it her? A misty white figure caught on camera by Cameron Hamilton when he used his iPod Touch, left, is England's Lost Queen,  Lady Arbella Stuart, according to council staff . Luck: Cameron Hamilton took the snap while visiting Nottinghamshire County Council's Rufford Abbey Country Park with friends, and says the discovery reinforces his belief in the paranormal . She died of starvation in the Tower of London in 1615, and was the great great granddaughter of Henry VII and Mary Queen of Scots' niece. 15-year-old Cameron, from Bilsthorpe, Nottinghamshire, said his belief in the supernatural has been bolstered after seeing the pictures. 'I was quite surprised and was not expecting it. I believe in ghosts and the supernatural and this has further convinced me that they do exist, ' he said. Family: Cameron (left) with his mother Helen and brother Alistair, who all looked at the picture and thought they saw a ghost . His mother, Helen, said they were shocked by what they saw when they looked at Cameron's pictures at home, and went on to show staff at the country park. 'Cameron has taken it all in his stride,' she said. 'Apparently he was reading the information panels in the Abbey 'Undercroft' about the ghostly legends of Rufford and decided to take some photos to see he could capture anything spooky on film. 'It was only when he got home and we examined the film that we saw this image of a White Lady clearly in shot. You can make out the jewellery she is wearing and her face too.' The photographs show the arched stone doorway to the medieval Cellarium area of the ruins, and appear to show a misty white figure. Debbie Hibbert, who manages the tourist information centre at Rufford Abbey, which is managed by Newark and Sherwood District Council, said: 'It certainly looked like a figure - like a young woman in full old fashioned dress, hovering over the door.' Nottinghamshire County Council Visitor Services Manager Linda Hardy, who is based at Rufford Abbey, explained the history behind the legend of the White Lady. She said: 'There's a local legend that one of the ghosts of Rufford is The White Lady - who some say is the spirit of Arbella Stuart, tragic granddaughter of Bess of Hardwick. 'Her parents were secretly married at the Abbey. I've heard of one or two sightings of her by local people in past years. 'Maybe Cameron has managed to capture a genuine Ghost of Christmas Past.' Rufford Abbey hosted an evening event to look for ghosts a few weeks back - and with its background as a Cistercian Abbey and a grand country house, there have been numerous sightings of different ghosts throughout the years. One type of white rose in the rose garden at Rufford Abbey is also named after The White Lady.","Cameron Hamilton, 15, took a photograph at Rufford Abbey Country Park .

British post-menopausal women are 50 per cent less likely to be offered treatment for vaginal problems than those in Europe and the U.S., a new study has found. Around one and a half million women in the UK suffer from the post-menopausal condition called vaginal atrophy which is caused by a deficiency in oestrogen. But new research has found that just 21 per cent of sufferers in the UK are being given access to appropriate treatments such as oestrogen therapy - 50 per cent less than those in Europe and the US. Ignored: Just 21% of British women suffering from vaginal atrophy are receiving appropriate treatment for the condition . As a result, many women in Britain avoid sex with their partners because of the condition, which causes vaginal dryness, itching and painful intercourse. The study, called the Clarifying vaginal atrophy's impact On Sex and Relationships (CLOSER) study which has been published in Menopause International, is the first of its kind. It found the lack of treatment in the UK led to British post-menopausal women with vaginal atrophy having less sex than women in Europe and North America. Over 60 per cent said fear of painful sex was one of the main reasons they avoided intimacy, with almost one third of women and male partners saying that vaginal discomfort had caused a 'big problem' for their sex lives. Dr Heather Currie, co-author of the study and Associate Specialist Gynaecologist at the Dumfries and Galloway Royal Infirmary, said: 'Given the obvious impact of vaginal atrophy on women in the UK, and their partners, it is very sad to learn that we are lagging behind other Western countries in terms of ensuring appropriate access to treatment. It is possible to enjoy an intimate love life if you suffer with the condition, providing you have access to the correct treatment . 'It is our hope that the CLOSER study will encourage our fellow medical professionals, and women themselves, to routinely raise the topic of post-menopausal vaginal health, thereby facilitating appropriate diagnosis and treatment.' Before the menopause the skin and tissues around the vagina are kept supple and moist by fluids and mucus. These are made by glands at the neck of your womb. Oestrogen affects these glands. and also affects your tissues in and around your vagina, causing the lining of your vagina to be thicker and more elastic. Oestrogen also stimulates the cells that line your vagina to produce glycogen, a compound which encourages the presence of helpful germs (bacteria) which protect your vagina from infections. After the menopause your ovaries make less oestrogen. The lack of oestrogen leads to thinning of the tissues around your vagina and a reduction in the number of glands that make mucus. You may also lose some fat tissue from around the genital area. Vaginal atrophy is a condition that causes dryness, discomfort and can make having sex difficult. After the menopause a woman's ovaries make . less of the hormone oestrogen. The lack of oestrogen leads to thinning of the tissues . around the vagina and a reduction in the number of glands that make . mucus. This can be very uncomfortable but it can also lead to serious . long-term urogenital problems if left untreated. It can also have a significant . emotional impact on women as it often leads to reduced intimacy with . partners. It is possible to manage the condition providing you have access to the right treatment. Treatment options include hormone replacement therapy (HRT), oestrogen cream or pessaries and lubricating gels. Vaginal atrophy can lead to serious long-term urogenital problems if left untreated because it can thin the bladder wall. It can also have a significant emotional impact on women as it often leads to reduced intimacy with partners. Local oestrogen is the main treatment recommended by The British Menopause Society. British women who tried local oestrogen . treatment for vaginal atrophy reported beneficial effects such as less . painful sex, more satisfying sex for their partner and themselves and . having sex more often. 'More than two-thirds of British women in CLOSER used lubricants and moisturisers to treat their vaginal symptoms, but these are not as effective as oestrogen therapy as they do not treat the underlying cause,' explained Dr Nick Panay, co-author and Consultant Gynaecologist, Queen Charlotte's & Chelsea and Chelsea & Westminster Hospitals, London, . 'Local oestrogen offers women a well-tolerated and effective solution to vaginal atrophy which, as the CLOSER study illustrates, can significantly disrupt many relationships.'","Just 21% of British women suffering from vaginal atrophy receive treatment for the common condition caused by a lack of oestrogen .

Samantha and Sarah Mills-Westley want to discover more about the man who killed their 60-year-old mother Jennifer in their quest for an independent review into how he remained free to murder. In February homeless Bulgarian-born drug addict Deyan Deyanov, 29, was sentenced to 20 years in a secure psychiatric unit on the holiday island after slaying Ms Mills-Westley. Deyanov, who had been sectioned in . North Wales in 2010 under the Mental Health Act, attacked the victim . while she was shopping in the popular resort of Los Cristianos in the . Canary Islands, on May 13, 2011. Tragic end: Grandmother Jennifer Mills-Westley, 60, was beheaded while shopping in Tenerife . The . delusional drifter was living rough in a derelict building on . Tenerife's Los Cristianos beach, used crack cocaine and LSD and had . built a shrine full of religious imagery. His history of violence can be traced back to his hometown of Ruse, a city in northern Bulgaria known as the Little Vienna. After . leaving Bulgaria, he drifted all over Europe, staying in Edinburgh and . North Wales, where he was sectioned but he was released from care in . October 2010 and travelled to Tenerife. He believed he was Jesus Christ and on earth to create a new Jerusalem and heard voices commanding him to kill. Well-known as a troublemaker to police and social services on the island, he had been arrested at least four times between January and May 2011. In January 2011, he committed a series of random violent attacks and was committed to La Candelaria hospital's psychiatric unit, but was released on bail in early February. Days before he killed Ms Mills-Westley an arrest warrant was issued for him. After his conviction, the victim's two daughters Samantha, 39, and Sarah, 43, hit out at the authorities for their handling of Deyanov. Quest: Daughters Samantha (left) and Sarah (right) want an independent review into why Deyanov remained free to murder . Tonight, in a Channel 4 Dispatches programme, the sisters, who are calling for an independent review, meet the killer's aunt in North Wales to ask if he received the right care. Samantha says: 'When he first got admitted, he was relatively well behaved, even though he was showing signs of having schizophrenic episodes, of talking to people who didn't exist. Telling his aunty that he was God. 'After the brutality of that attack . against my mother [Deyanov] still has more rights than I do as a victim... That cannot be right.' - Sarah Mills-Westley, whose mother Jennifer was murdered by Bulgarian schizophrenic drifter Deyan Deyanov . 'The second time he was admitted, she said that his behaviour had really becoming incredibly erratic. That he was becoming violent.' Her sister Sarah tells the programme: 'It appears that Deyanov left the hospital without a treatment plan and that the family had no idea that a) he had been released or that b) there was a mechanism of support that should have been released with him. 'It was really up to him to sort himself out.' She adds: 'We still haven't got justice for our mum, and what's really important for us now as a family is an independent review.' The family know the Health Board in North Wales conducted an internal inquiry into Deyanov's care but they were refused access to it. Instead, the sisters were told by letter that: 'lessons have been learnt' yet the board will not say what those lessons are - because of patient confidentiality. Sarah says: 'I now have to sit and write a letter to the man who beheaded my mother asking him for his permission to have access to his medical records. 'Bearing in mind I saw him in court, he is clearly delusional, he's still hearing voices he's a very sick man. 'And after the brutality of that attack . against my mother he still has more rights than I do as a victim, and . the rest of our family. That cannot be right.' Drifter: Bulgarian Deyan Deyanov was convicted of decapitating Ms Mills-Westley and sentenced to 20 years in a psychiatric unit . The Health Board in Wales told Channel 4 Dispatches: 'The Health Board is naturally deeply sympathetic to the predicament of the family of the deceased and fully understands their desire to seek answers. 'Our detailed investigations into the treatment provided to Mr Deyanov are continuing and it would be premature to offer comment at this stage. 'Any response we are able to provide is, in any event, likely to be limited due to confidentiality restrictions imposed on us under the Data Protection Act. 'However, we can state categorically that the decision to discharge Mr Deyanov was in no way influenced by issues of funding or shortages of beds.' The programmes airs at 8pm tonight.","Jennifer Mills-Westley was killed by Bulgarian drifter Deyan Deyanov .

The White House has announced that President Obama plans to nominate a Bush-era Justice Department deputy as the next head of the FBI. If confirmed by the Senate, James Comey, a Republican,  will replace Robert Mueller, who has served as FBI chief since 2001 and plans to resign this September. Comey will inherit an agency grappling with privacy debates over a host of recently exposed investigative tactics. The White House said in a statement that Obama would announce his choice of Comey on Friday afternoon. New blood? President Obama plans to nominate Bush-era Justice Department deputy James Comey, a Republican, as the next FBI director on Friday, the White House said Wednesday . Comey was a federal prosecutor who served for several years as the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York before coming to Washington after the Sept. 11 attacks as deputy attorney general. During that time, Comey gained a high profile as the prosecutor who put away such notable criminals as mob boss John Gambino and the queen of all homemakers Martha Stewart. In recent years he's been an executive at defense company Lockheed Martin, general counsel to a hedge fund, board member at HSBC Holdings and lecturer on national security law at Columbia Law School. The White House may hope that Comey's Republican background and strong credentials will help him through Senate confirmation at a time when some of Obama's nominees have been facing tough battles. Republicans have said they see no major obstacles to his confirmation, although he is certain to face tough questions about his hedge fund work, his ties to Wall Street as well as how he would handle current, high-profile FBI investigations. Conservative choice? Comey, seen here at a swearing in for House Judiciary Committee hearing concerning reauthorization of the PATRIOT Act in 2005, opposed warrantless wiretapping and advanced interrogation techinques . Read Comey's unsent resignation letter to George W. Bush... The FBI is responsible for both intelligence and law enforcement with more than 36,000 employees. It has faced questions in recent weeks over media leak probes involving The Associated Press and Fox News; the Boston Marathon bombings; the attack at Benghazi, Libya, that killed four Americans; and two vast government surveillance programs into phone records and online communications. The White House has announced that James Comey, the former Bush Administration deputy attorney general from 2003 to 2005 will be nominated as the next FBI director. Though he is a Republican, Comey is a comely candidate to the Obama administration for several reasons. He opposed advanced interrogation techniques. Though Comer ultimately agreed that advanced interrogation techniques like waterboarding were legal, he opposed their use by the Bush administration and said as much. He opposed wiretapping. As the Bush administration sought to reauthorize warrantless wiretapping as part of the war on terror, Comey forcefully opposed it and even threatened to quit. He's tough on gun crime. As a child, Comey and his family were held hostage by an intruder at gunpoint. As a Virginia prosecutor, he successfully beefed up sentencing in cases involving weapons charges. He's a Republican and will likely face a less hostile Senate confirmation. The leaker of those National Security Agency programs, former NSA contractor Edward Snowden, also is the subject of an ongoing criminal investigation. And just this week Mueller revealed the FBI uses drones for surveillance of stationary subjects and said the privacy implications of such operations are worthy of debate. Comey played a central role in holding up Bush's warrantless wiretapping program, one of the administration's great controversies and an episode that focused attention on the administration's controversial tactics in the war on terror. In dramatic testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee in 2007, Comey said he thought the no-warrant wiretapping program was so questionable that he refused for a time to reauthorize it, leading to a standoff with White House officials at the hospital bedside of an ailing Attorney General John Ashcroft. Comey said he refused to recertify the program because Ashcroft had reservations about its legality. Senior government officials had expressed concerns about whether the NSA, which administered the warrantless eavesdropping program, had the proper oversight in place. Other concerns included whether any president possessed the legal and constitutional authority to authorize the program as it was carried out at the time. Though he refuses to answer questions on the topic, Comey and other top Justice Department brass planned to resign over the issue in 2004. Comey even wrote a resignation letter to Bush, but it was never sent. Comey was deputy attorney general in 2005 when he unsuccessfully tried to limit tough interrogation tactics against suspected terrorists. He told then-Attorney General Alberto Gonzales that some of the practices were wrong and would damage the department's reputation. Some Democrats denounced those methods as torture, particularly the use of waterboarding, which produces the sensation of drowning. High-profile: Prior to his time with the Bush Administration, Comer was U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York and successfully prosecuted big name criminals like Martha Stewart and mob boss John Gambino . Perfect fit? Comer is an attractive candidate for the currently embattled FBI, with his history of opposing warrantless wiretapping and waterboarding. His nomination is expected to be announced by President Obama on Friday . As U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, Comey headed one of the nation's most prominent prosecutorial offices and one at the front lines in the fight against terrorism, corporate malfeasance, organized crime and the war on drugs. As an assistant U.S. attorney in Virginia, Comey handled the investigation of the 1996 bombing of the Khobar Towers housing complex near Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, which killed 19 U.S. military personnel. He led the Justice Department's corporate fraud task force and spurred the creation of violent crime impact teams in 20 cities, focusing on crimes committed with guns. After leaving government in 2005, Comey was senior vice president and general counsel at Lockheed Martin. In 2010, he went to the Westport, Conn.-based hedge fund Bridgewater Associates, before leaving in February. The White House also said Comey has developed improvements in the military justice system's performance regarding crimes committed in Iraq and Afghanistan as a member of the Defense Legal Policy Board, which provides independent advice to the defense secretary. Comey also has taught at the University of Richmond Law School and worked for law firm McGuireWoods LLP, also in Richmond. He has a bachelor's degree from the College of William & Mary, a law degree from the University of Chicago Law School and clerked for former District Court Judge John M. Walker, Jr. in the Southern District of New York.","James Comey, a Republican, served as Deputy Attorney General under George W. Bush from 2003 to 2005 .

A grandmother has become one of the longest-surviving transplant patients in the country after 40 years living with a donated kidney. Kathleen Hart, 70, underwent a kidney transplant in December 1973, with the organ expected to last for just five years. The retired postal worker has stunned experts by living with the kidney for eight times as long, and is still the picture of good health. One of the longest surviving transplant patients in the country, 70-year-old Kathleen Hart in the 1970s (left) and today (right) She believes her good fortune is all the more remarkable because she had her transplant on the traditionally unlucky day of Friday the 13th. She said: 'It is a wonderful feeling to have proved the experts wrong. And to be told that I am one of the longest survivors in the UK is a real honour and an accolade I am proud of. 'I haven't got a theory why the kidney has lasted so long - I don't have any special food, drink or activity to help things. I suppose I'm just a very, very lucky person. 'And I still feel in great health, hopefully there'll be a few more years in the kidney yet.' Mrs Hart, of Sutton-in-Craven, West Yorkshire, became ill at the age of 25 but was not aware the problem was linked to her kidneys. A few years later she was eventually sent to St James's Hospital in Leeds where renal failure was diagnosed. Mrs Hart only had days to live before she was put on dialysis while an organ donor was found. She said: 'While I was on dialysis I had to be very careful what I ate and drank, I could never go away on holidays - even in England - and was forced to live a very restricted life. Mrs Hart has lived for four decades and seen the birth of her two grandchildren . 'It was tough, for all the family, at times. But we supported each other, worked through it and it was never a problem as such.' When a compatible organ became available, her husband Ken, 69, a local councillor, was reluctant for her to have it because he feared the risks. But Mrs Hart responded to the operation well, and recovered in hospital for three weeks with family members allowed to visit in special sterile clothes. She said: 'People will say to me 'ooh it's Friday the 13th this week you know' and I'll smile and say back to them 'I know and I can't wait'. 'It's most people's unlucky day but it's my luckiest day and I look forward to them every time one's coming up. 'Before the operation I was never allowed to drink coffee. And I remember after the operation one of the doctors told me not to drink any of the hospital's coffee and said he would go out and fetch me a proper one. 'The taste was divine, I'll never forget that.' Eventually, when she was allowed home, the couple were able to lead a normal life, going on family holidays and eating out. It meant that she was able to see her son Robert, 47, grow up and get married, and witness the births of Daniel, 22, and Jennifer, 20. This week, to celebrate her achievement, she held a special party for family and close friends at the on the anniversary of her surgery. She added: 'I'm living proof of how vital organ donation is. It really does allow people to live a full and normal life, like we have done. I've been given the gift of life. 'I'm hoping my story shows how important the kidney transplant programme is and that people should continue to donate.' The Harts never discovered the identity of the organ donor, but they believe it may have been a local girl who died in a car accident. Lindsey Ledden, of Kidney Research UK, said they had no statistics relating to the longest surviving transplant patients but a transplant usually lasted between 10 and 15 years. She said: 'More than 6000 people, around 90 per cent of the total organ waiting list, are waiting for a kidney, but less than 3000 transplants are carried out each year.'","Kathleen Hart, 70, underwent a kidney transplant in December 1973 .

A student kicked out of university for being gay has been told she must repay her tuition fees before the college will transfer her credits to another school. Danielle Powell was just one semester shy of graduation when she was expelled from ‘premier Midwest Christian college’ Grace University in Omaha, Nebraska last year for being a lesbian. The university has refused to transfer credits earned by Powell during her three-and-a-half-years at the college until she pays them $6,300. Danielle Powell, right, was kicked out of her university for being gay in 2012, while wife Michelle Rogers, left, has launched an online petition calling for the university to drop its demand for $6,300 . Powell was already a student at Grace University in early 2011 when she began her first same-sex relationship. Prior to that she had not identified as lesbian. When authorities at the university found out about the relationship Powell was brought before a judiciary board to decide whether she should be allowed to stay enrolled. Initially Powell agreed to participate in a restoration program, involving counseling and regular church attendance, in order to complete her education. But shortly before the start of the spring 2012 semester, Grace decided not to  her because she was still dating women. Grace University in Omaha, Nebraska describes itself on its website as a 'premier Midwest Christian college' She was promptly expelled and received a letter from Grace University Executive V.P. Michael James explaining that  'it would be impossible for the faculty of Grace University to affirm your Christian character, a requirement for degree conferral.’ In addition to being expelled, school officials revoked her academic scholarship and told her she owed the university $6,300. Justifing the college's actions, James told The Huffington Post that the university's student handbook forbids ‘sexually immoral behavior.’ Quoting from the handbook, James stated that ‘premarital sex, adultery, and ""homosexual acts"" all could lead to probation and/or a judiciary hearing.' To protest at what she views an unfair victimization of Powell, her wife, Michelle Rogers, has . launched an online petition calling for the university to drop its . demand. Married: Powell, right, proposed to Rogers at a Macklemore concert in December . The petition has gained over 16,000 signatures since it launched last weekend. 'I’m asking for your help in petitioning Grace University to drop tuition fees owed for the Spring Semester of 2011,' Rogers says in the petition. 'We are a young, recently married couple and this lingering debt - which Danielle should not have to pay and Grace has no right to demand - is holding her back.'

A Michigan doctor who disappeared nearly a month ago had been stalking a well-known local gospel singer, and even referred to him as her 'husband', a local newspaper reports. Dr Teleka Patrick, 30, had a personal protection order filed against her by pastor and gospel singer Marvin Sapp, 46, who said Dr Patrick had visited his home and contacted his young children to get close to him. It is also indicated in the PPO that Dr Patrick, who started her residency at Borgess Medical Center in Kalamazoo, Michigan last year, moved to the area from California because of Pastor Sapp. Scroll down for video . Dr Teleka Patrick, 30, who started her residency at Borgess Medical Center in Kalamazoo, Michigan last year, disappeared in early December . 'She has moved from CA to MI,' Sapp wrote in part in the PPO request. 'Joined my church, contacts my children, and has been to my home.' WOOD-TV reported that Pastor Sapp had filed the PPO order in September, and that he had 'over 400 page(s) of correspondence from her to which I have never responded.' He added that Patrickâ€™s stalking had gone on for at least a year prior to her moving to Michigan. The young doctor was reported missing when she did not show up for work on December 6. Surveillance footage showed her the night before failing to secure a room at a Radisson hotel just five minutes away from her apartment. Stalked: Pastor and gospel singer Marvin Sapp, 46, filed a personal protection order against Teleka Patrick after she visited his home and contacted his young children to get close to him . According to police, Dr Patrick worked a shift at Borgess on December 5 and had one of her colleagues drive her to the Radisson after work. Both her purse and cellphone were found left behind at work, and surveillance footage at the hotel shows her trying to get a room with cash, but not having enough money. In the footage, without . audio, Dr Patrick talks calmly with the front desk clerk for about 15 . minutes before leaving after not getting the room. She . is then seen boarding a complimentary hotel shuttle back to her gold . Lexus parked at the medical center - the last time anyone saw her. It . was really sad to watch it because this is the last video record of her . before she went missing,' Teleka's sister Tenesha Patrick told WWMT. Just two hours later, Dr Patrick's . car was discovered abandoned in a ditch on the westbound side of 1-94, . more than 100 miles away in Portage, Indiana. The keys were missing from . the inside of the car. Trying to find a room: Dr Patrick is pictured walking up to the Radisson hotel in Kalamazoo after getting a ride there after work . Why was she there? Dr Patrick's family doesn't know why she was trying to book a room. Investigators later found she left both her phone and purse at work . No cards: Dr Patrick was caught on the hotel's surveillance cameras trying and failing to secure the room with cash . Dr Patrick was officially reported missing the next day when she failed to show up for work. One of her colleagues told investigators that she received a phone call that day and that her demeanor changed after she hung up. Dr Patrick's parents, who live in Florida, said she has a busy schedule but usually calls them once a week, usually on Sundays. They did not believe that their daughter was in a romantic relationship. Her family has now asked the investigator handling another famous missing persons case, Mary Land, who disappeared ten years ago, to help find her. Dr Patrick's parents met with Jim Carlin of Justinian Investigative Services in Battle Creek and the agency will now work on her case. Leaving: The last time Dr Patrick is caught on surveillance cameras, she is seen boarding a complimentary hotel shuttle which took her back to the medical center where her car was parked . Dr Patrick had started her first year of residency in Kalamazoo after graduating from medical school last spring . Close to home: The hotel is located just five minutes from Dr Patrick's apartment . Her mother Irene told CNN: 'She has an outgoing personality... she's a warm, friendly, lovely person to be around.' She added that her daughter had just bought a plane ticket to fly to Florida. 'Who was calling her, what was that about, does that have anything to do with her disappearance?' her sister asked. Her . family is currently offering a $10,000 reward for information on her . disappearance, and have hired their own private investigator. 'We keep getting closer to Christmas, and it keeps getting further and further away,' Tenesha told ABC News. Anyone with information on Dr Patrick's disappearance are being asked to call the Indiana State Police at 219-696-6242 or the Kalamazoo County Sheriff's Department at 269-383-8748.","Dr Teleka Patrick, from Michigan, has been missing since December 6 .

At least five people have been killed during Beirut's rush hour today in a suspected car bomb as Syria’s civil war continues to spread to neighbouring Lebanon. The explosion rocked a stronghold of the Shiite Hezbollah group in the southern suburbs of the Lebanese capital, setting cars ablaze and sending a column of black smoke above the city skyline. The nature of the explosion that hit the Haret Hreik neighbourhood was not immediately clear, but a Lebanese security official said it appeared to be caused by a car bomb. Scroll down for video . Rush hour blast: At least five people have been killed in Beirut today in a suspected car bomb as Syria's civil war continues to spread into neighbouring Lebanon . If confirmed as a bombing, it will be the latest in a wave of attacks to hit Lebanon in recent months as the civil war in Syria increasingly spills over into its smaller neighbour. The attacks have targeted both Sunni and Shiite neighbourhoods, further stoking sectarian tensions that are already running high because of the war next door. Rocked southern suburbs: Police inspect the wreckage at the site of the blast and if confirmed as a car bomb will be the latest in a string of attacks in recent months . Tension builds: People gather at the bombing site which targeted both Sunni and Shiite neighbourhoods stoking sectarian tensions that are already running high . Lebanon's Health Ministry said at least five people were killed and 20 wounded in the explosion, which left the mangled wreckage of cars in the street and blew out the windows of store fronts. Images broadcast on Hezbollah's Al-Manar TV showed firefighters putting out the smouldering hulks of several cars that had been set ablaze. The footage showed at least one building that had part of its facade blown off and several neighbouring buildings were also damaged. Al-Manar said the explosion occurred ‘a few hundred metres [218 yards] from the politburo of Hezbollah’. It said the political office was not the target of the blast. Blighted city skyline: Firefighters put out cars set ablaze by the explosion and at least one building had its facade blown off with several other neighbouring buildings damaged . Desperate: A man carried an injured woman from the blast site as troops tried to cordon off the area to keep the angry crowds away from the scene . Hezbollah security agents, as well as Lebanese troops, were trying to cordon off the area to keep the angry crowds away from the blast site. Ali Oleik, an accountant who works in a nearby office building, said: ‘Suddenly the whole area went bright and we started running away. ‘I saw two bodies on the street, one of a woman and another of a man on a motorcycle who was totally deformed.’ Car bomb catastrophe: Lebanese citizens gather at the scene of the December 27 bombing which went off a few hundred yards from government and parliament buildings . String of attacks: A man carries an injured woman to an ambulance after another explosion in downtown Beirut on December 27 killed six and injured at least 15 . Authorities brought out bomb-sniffing dogs and at one point announced that there might be another bomb, setting the crowd scattering in panic from the area. The explosion comes a week after a car bombing in downtown Beirut killed prominent Sunni politician Mohammed Chatah who had been critical of Syrian President Bashar Assad and his Hezbollah allies. Hezbollah's once seemingly impenetrable bastion of support - Beirut's southern suburbs - also has been hit several times in recent months. Up in flames: Only a week ago, prominent Sunni politician Mohammed Chatah was killed in a car bombing in downtown Beirut . Outspoken: Mr Chatah (right) had been critical of Syrian President Bashar Assad (left) and his Hezbollah allies . The Haret Hreik neighbourhood where Thursday's explosion took place is close to the Beir el-Abed district where a powerful car bomb killed nearly 20 people in August. The attacks raise the spectre of a sharply divided Lebanon being pulled further into the Syrian conflict, which is being fought on increasingly sectarian lines pitting Sunnis against Shiites. Syria-based Sunni rebels and militant Islamist groups fighting to topple Assad have threatened to target Hezbollah strongholds in Lebanon in retaliation for intervening on behalf of his regime in the conflict.","The explosion rocked the Shiite Hezbollah stronghold in the Lebanese city .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 20:31 EST, 29 December 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 20:31 EST, 29 December 2013 . As her beloved daughter lay dying two years ago, Charla Moye asked doctors to do something other parents might consider unthinkable: 'At least save her organs'. It's a decision the cardiac nurse does not regret. She tragically lost her 'baby', but four organ recipients are now alive thanks to Liane Adgate's body parts. During the worst weekend of her life, Moye agreed to let the Tampa Bay Times follow her and watch the recovery of her daughter's organs in a bid to raise awareness about donations. Heartbreaking: Charla Moye holds her daughter Liana's hand one last time before she is taken to an operating room to have her organs recovered . Moye's 31-year-old daughter Liane suffered a massive stroke in April 2011. Liane was rushed to hospital and placed on life support. But the swelling in the young mom's brain spread quickly and soon blood seeped into the right side. Liane had a seven-year-old daughter, Kara. Almost two . days after Liane's horrific stroke, a doctor pronounced . her brain dead. It was about 12.45pm on a Monday. That's when Moyes, 58, made the toughest decision of her life - to donate Liane's organs. Leaning over her daughter, pressing the young woman's hand against her wet cheek, she whispered: 'You did good, honey. You're going to help so . many people.' Moye had worked on transplant cases at . Tampa General, where her daughter was now on . life support. She knew how many people were waiting for organs, hoping . to get a second chance. Anyone who dies could save eight lives: two kidneys, two lungs, liver, pancreas, small intestine and heart. More than 50 more people might benefit if skin and tissue are also donated. Grieving: A picture of a horse, colored by her six-year-old daughter Kara, was placed in the casket with Liane, 31, during her funeral service . Meanwhile, outside in the hospital hall, a transplant team was assembling and specialists began streaming into the room. Each organ had its own support team, with more than 100 people working on each donor. Tampa Bay Times reported that doctors worked frantically to test Liane's organs. A . pulmonologist threaded a scope down Liane's throat to search her lungs . for signs of pneumonia before wrapping a white vest around her chest to stop the build-up of secretions. A kidney surgeon ordered blood tests to check for infection as a cardiologist took an ultrasound of Liane's heart. Hearts have to be working at a level of at least 50 percent to be transplanted. Liane's was at 35. Preparation: Liane's liver is cleaned, packaged and kept on ice for the team of doctors that will transplant it into an awaiting recipient . At the nurses' station, two . LifeLink workers added Liane's age, height, weight and blood type . to a database called United Network Organ Sharing to identify suitable organ recipients. 'It . takes such difficult coordination to keep all these organs viable, then . to get them all placed,' Dr. Tarik Haddad, the pulmonologist, said. 'And . once the recipients are found, they have to be called in for pre-op. So . we have to know where each organ is going before we recover it.' Specialists began the search for suitable recipients about 4.15pm by logging onto local waiting lists, . starting with the sickest and . those who'd waited the longest. Kidneys . can be transplanted up to 36 hours after recovery and flown all the . way across the country, while eyes and tissue can be shipped overseas. On . the third query about the liver, match specialists found a recipient . close enough to drive to Tampa General. On the fourth call for the . kidney, they connected with a man nearby who had been waiting three . years. The surgery was a success. Heartbreaking: While in the hospital room, Charla Moye taped a picture of Liane's six-year-old daughter, Kara, over her heart . After they had called 70 hospitals in Florida about the lungs and pancreas, the specialists started widening their range, 500 miles at a time. By midnight, the two women had logged more than 300 calls, texts and emails. Just before 9am Tuesday, the transplant coordinator said surgeons declined Liane's heart. Too much time had passed. For Moye, it was as if Liane had died all over again. She collapsed in sadness. Once . the heart stops, lungs have to be transplanted within four hours, . livers within 12. Kidneys can last two days. Bones and skin can be . stored for two years. Moyes leaned over her daughter's body, wiped each closed lid with her thumb and whispered, 'I love you'. 'She will always be my baby': When cardiac nurse Charla Moye's 31-year-old daughter, Liane, passed away the decision to donate her organs was a priority - as a way to find a bright spot in a tragedy . At 12.30pm, doctors removed Liane's three-pound liver. One specialist ran a cold preservation solution through the organ to flush the warm blood and slow metabolism. Then they doused the liver in a bowl of clear saline slush before it was packaged in a bag with crushed ice. In three hours, the team preserved the liver, one lung and both kidneys. Specialists couldn't find a match for the pancreas or small intestine, so they left them intact. In the end, four organs were recovered which meant the lives of four strangers had been saved. 'Oh, that's wonderful!' Moye sobbed. 'I want to meet them. I want my granddaughter to meet them too, to see the people her mommy helped. 'I want to tell them about Liane. I want them to know the good they have inside them.'","Charla Moye allowed her daughter's organs to be donated .

An eco-conscious gardener who packed a trailer full of grass cuttings was turned away from a recycling site - because he was towing it on  a bicycle. Retired Ray Duggleby was told by council officials that only motorised vehicles were  allowed at the site for health and safety reasons even though pedestrians were walking around. The 66-year-old has accused the council of hypocrisy - claiming they only promote recycling when it is convenient for them. Health and safety: Ray Duggleby, 66, was told he couldn't use facilities at a recycling site in Weel, Yorkshire, because he was using a bicycle which posed a health and safety risk . Mr Duggleby had already filled up the brown waste bin supplied by the  council for garden waste after trimming the hedges around his home in Beverley, East Yorkshire. The keen cyclist then adapted his  trailer to fit on his bicycle so he could tow the green waste to the recycling centre in Weel, Beverley. But he was stunned when he was told he couldn't bring his bicycle on to the site because of health and safety laws. He said: 'I just couldn't believe it. I thought I was doing the right thing but  then they told me that ""you're only allowed in if you're towing your trailer  using a car"". 'They said my bike classed as a wheelbarrow, which I couldn't understand  because you don't push it. Risk: A spokesman for East Riding of Yorkshire Council, which runs the recycling facility pictured above, said the site would be dangerous for a cyclist because it has a 'constant flow of traffic' 'I like to cycle, it's good for the . environment and I don't believe in fly  tipping. I try to do as much as I . can to encourage my neighbours to recycle and I  thought that the . council wanted to be as environmentally friendly as possible. 'After this I feel as though they actually only want to recycle if it's easy  for them. It's very hypocritical of them to pretend they are in support of recycling  when they stand by a decision like this. 'Hypocritical': Ray Duggleby, 66, accused the council of promoting recycling when it was convenient for them . 'I feel very upset and angry at what has happened. I cycled two miles there to  recycle and I had to take it all home.' A spokesman for East Riding of Yorkshire Council said the Weel site was a very  busy one with a constant flow of traffic. They said: 'For this reason there would be concern for a cyclist who is moving  around among cars and vans especially when they are reversing. 'Mr Duggleby will have been advised for his own safety not to use a bicycle on  the site.' George McManus, the Labour Party Parliamentary Spokesman for Beverley, said: 'Ray contacted me and asked if I could help, so I checked it out and it's true. 'The Council say that for health and safety reasons, he's not allowed to drop  his waste at the site by bicycle. 'They say they'd be worried for him because of vehicle movements on site even  although people walk across the site all the time and the maximum speed of cars  is in the region of 5mph. 'Ray is an example to us all. He is s true eco-warrior. By cycling he's keeping  down his carbon footprint. By taking his waste to a proper site he's having it recycled. By refusing to  fly tip, he's helping to keep Beverley tidy.' Mr McManus added: 'The Council should be encouraging people like Ray, not  putting him off. In order to get to the site he cycles along roads with 40mph speed limits and  yet he's not allowed to go to the re-cycling centre. 'If the site is unsuitable for people like Ray, then the Council should find  somewhere else. Or they could just show some common sense and change the rules.'

Tragic: Carolina Picchio, from Novara in Northern Italy leapt from her third floor bedroom window after insulting videos and photographs of her were circulated over the internet . A video of Miss Picchio looking the worse for wear in a bathroom at a party was uploaded to Facebook and remained on the site for several days. The Italian Parent's Association has now filed a criminal complaint against Facebook for its role in Miss Picchio's death.

'Italian law forbids minors under 18 signing  contracts, yet Facebook is effectively entering into a contract with minors regarding their privacy, without their parents knowing.' The video is believed to have been posted shortly after Miss Picchio left her boyfriend. He had apparently used the site to insult her a few days earlier. A note written to him which was found in her bedroom read: 'Isn't what you have done to me enough? You have made me pay too many times.' Before she took her own life she posted a note on the site which read: 'Forgive me if I am not strong. I cannot take it any longer.'

A deaf five-year-old girl due to undergo surgery in a hospital reduced to rubble by the Oklahoma tornado has finally had the operation after a nurse dug her hearing implant out of the debris. Jayde Scholl, a Chinese orphan adopted by an American doctor last year, was due to have a cochlear hearing device implanted in her ear last week. But the implant, which costs between $25,000 and $30,000, was lost when the Moore Medical Center was destroyed during the storm which wrecked 20,000 homes and killed 24 people last Monday. Jayde's operation was then postponed indefinitely while doctors considered the logistics of finding a replacement implant. Happy ending: Jayde Scholl, aged five, can be seen smiling as doctors test out her cochlear implant after a nurse found the missing device among the rubble of a hospital destroyed in the Oklahoma tornado . Before the storm: Jayde had been due to undergone the surgery at the Moore Medical Centre in Oklahoma . Tragedy: The Moore Medical Center was left as just a shell of the building after a tornado hit the area in Oklahoma last Monday . Speaking after the storm, Jayde's adoptive mother Jaque Scholl told kjrh: 'Well, her device is somewhere between Dallas and Kansas. I have no idea. I don't know what happens when a tornado takes the device away.' When nurse Sherry Raper heard about Jayde's predicament, she spent hours digging through the rubble until she found the computer-sized box holding Jayde's implant. Mrs Scholl said: 'The staff wanted something good to happen this week. They wanted Jaydeâ€™s journey to keep moving forward. An amazing community of folks have helped make this happen in the midst of so much tragedy.' Jayde underwent a successful surgery at the Norman Healthplex on Friday morning - meaning the five-year-old can finally hear in both her ears. Search: Nurse Sherry Raper spent several hours searching through the rubble of the Moore Medical Center in the aftermath of the tornado to find the cochlear implant . Success: After the cochlear implant was retrieved, Jayde Scholl was able to undergo an operation to have it placed in one of her ears . Jayde Scholl, who was unable to speak, hear or use sign language last year, can now hear in both ears after she had one cochlear implant in February and her second on Friday . The schoolgirl had previously undergone the cochlear implant surgery to correct the hearing in her other ear in February. A cochlear implant is an external device that receives the sound through a microphone, computer processes the sound and delivers the information to an internal device placed under the skin. But at one time, it was thought Jayde would never be able to hear. Jayde was placed in a Chinese orphanage after she was found abandoned by her birth mother in a town square when she was just eight-months-old. She had no access to medical treatment to help improve her hearing until she was adopted by Jaque Scholl, a doctor of audiology at the speech and hearing clinic Scholl Center, and her family last year. The family then concentrated on helping Jadye, who was unable to speak, hear or use sign language, to be able to hear for the first time by organising for the five-year-old to have cochlear implants in both ears. Giving hope: Jayde's adoptive mother, doctor Jaque Scholl, said staff at the Moore Medical Center, pictured after the storm, wanted some good to happen in the aftermath of the tornado . The cochlear implant was in a storage cupboard at the Moore Medical Center, pictured, in Oklahoma when the storm hit. Nurse Sherry Raper remembered where it had been stored and set out to find it .","Five-year-old Jayde Scholl was unable to speak, hear or use sign language .

Admission: Nigel Farage said he opened an offshore trust fund to slash his tax bill but never used it . Nigel Farage was today branded a 'hypocrite' after admitting he opened an  offshore trust fund to slash his tax bill while campaigning against tax avoidance. The leader of the UK Independence Party set up a scheme on the Isle of Man for ‘inheritance purposes’. But he claimed he never used it saying: ‘It was a mistake. I’m not rich enough.’ Mr Farage told fellow members of the European Parliament last month that they had a ‘common enemy – rich people, successful companies evading tax’. Labour MP John Spellar said: 'I know Nigel Farage wants to appeal to disaffected Tories, but copying some of the Tories' biggest donors by using offshore trusts to avoid tax is taking things too far. 'It's typical of UKIP - they talk about how much they love this country, but they don't even bank here - it's just hypocritical.' While Mr Farage's trust is within the law, he has attacked Brussels bureaucrats on £100,000 a year who pay just 12 per cent tax on their income. He said: ‘It is tax fraud on an absolutely massive scale, how can that be fair?’ Mr Farage, a former City commodities trader, created the Farage Family Educational Trust 1654 ten years ago, according to documents seen by the Daily Mirror. Accounts reveal he owned shares in this trust briefly during 2004, having transferred shareholdings from his trading firm – Farage Ltd. That meant the offshore trust owned 50 per cent of his firm. He set up the trust with his brother Andrew, who pocketed £969,000 in dividends from his trading firm. Mistake: Mr Farage said that setting up the account was a mistake because he is 'not rich enough' An embarrassed Mr Farage said: ‘My . financial advisors recommended I did it, to have a trust really for . inheritance purposes and I took the advice and I set it up. It was a . mistake. 'I was a completely unsuitable person for it. I am not blaming them it was my fault.’ The . UKIP leader said it was an ‘educational trust’ to ‘build up a trust . fund for your children or grandchildren’s school fees, things like . that’. Costly: Tax avoidance has been top of Prime Minister David Cameron's agenda at this week's G8 summit in Northern Ireland . But he added: ‘Firstly, I’m not rich enough to need one and I am never going to be. ‘Secondly frankly the world’s changed. Things that we thought were absolutely fair practice ten, 20 years ago aren’t any more. 'Thirdly, it was a mistake because it cost me money, I sent a cheque to set it up.’ Tax avoidance has been at the top of David Cameron’s agenda at this week’s G8 summit in Northern Ireland. It is estimated to cost Britain £35billion a year. Mr Farage’s accountant confirmed all the dividends were paid to Andrew Farage, who insisted he had paid all his taxes. He added: ‘I packed up business completely in 2004.’ Nigel Farage declared to the EU Parliament in January 2004 that he was a paid director of Farage Ltd. He became UKIP leader in 2006, and his EU register states he was paid for commodity broking every year from 2004 to 2009 when this was his only business appointment according to Companies House records. He remained a shareholder in Farage Ltd until 2011. It is now subject to a ‘voluntary order’ – one step from bankruptcy’ and has debts of more than £130,000 to be paid off by 2017. There is no inheritance tax and most companies pay no corporation tax on the Isle of Man where tax avoidance is a huge industry.","UKIP leader Mr Farage set up the scheme on the Isle of Man .

This is definitely a case of workmanship falling short of the mark required - about 12 inches short to be precise. Road workers have baffled residents after only repainting half a cycle lane marking - leaving it looking like 'someone has painted two Polo mints on the road'. Instead of neatly repainting the whole sign after a section of a busy Hull road was dug up for a cable to be replaced, workers messily painted just a set of wheels to denote a cycle lane. Woeful: Road workers have been ridiculed for this shoddy attempt to repaint a cycle lane in Hull . It has left Balfour Beatty and Northern . Powergrid, who asked the contractor to carry out the work, red-faced . after passers-by ridiculed the woeful work which even the artist . admitted was shoddy. Celia Hitchman, who lives opposite . the cycle lane, said: 'It looks like someone has just come along and . painted two Polo mints onto the road.' Neighbour . Ken Baldwin who is the former manager of Hull Business Improvement . District (Bid), said: 'I would have thought someone would have been . along to inspect it. 'I smiled when I saw it. I just thought, ""typical"".' Pet . shop owner Rob Nicklas said: 'I didn’t know whether to laugh or cry. I’m really surprised they only painted half the cycle sign. 'I know paint is expensive these days, but it doesn’t make any sense to paint half a sign. 'I was cycling to work in Hull when I spotted it. I couldn’t believe it.' Dog walker Sue Wilkinson also saw the funny side, but thought it did not portray Cottingham in the best light. Sue said: 'If you’re going to do a job, you should do it properly. It looked pretty amateurish.' A little further down the same road, more example of dubious paintwork was spotted. This . time, only the letters ‘O’ and ‘W’ - to make the word ‘SLOW’ - had been . painted on a patch of road that had recently been resurfaced. Ridiculous: One passerby said it looked as if 'someone has just come along and painted two Polo mints onto the road' James Merrylees, external communications manager at Sheffield firm Balfour Beatty, said: 'Unfortunately, our artistic skills do not seem to have met our usual high standards in this instance. 'These markings were put down as a temporary measure by our reinstatement team and have now been rectified. We are sorry for any confusion caused.' Balfour Beatty is working in the area, on behalf of Northern Powergrid, to replace and upgrade a major electricity cable. A spokesman for East Riding Council said: 'Following the completion of these major works by contractors working on behalf of Northern Powergrid, the council has become aware of a number of shortcomings in the quality of the work done, including the road markings in several locations.

"By . Rachel Reilly . PUBLISHED: . 08:26 EST, 21 June 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 06:03 EST, 22 June 2013 . A seven-month-old boy is suffering with a large growth that resembles a tail and it is growing longer every week. The growth developed a result of the boy, named Xiao Wei, being born with spina bifida. His mother Chen Wei, from Guangdong in Southern China, said she has asked for the growth to be removed but surgeons say it isn't possible, at least at the moment. Seven-month-old Xiao Wei was born with spina bifida, a condition that causes the spine to become deformed. It is this that has caused the unusual growth at the bottom of his spinal column . She said: 'We have asked the surgeons to remove the tail but they tell us it is not that simple.' Spina bifida or 'split spine' is a fault in the development of the spine and spinal cord which leaves a gap in the spine. The spinal cord is responsible for connecting all parts of the body to the brain. In the first month of life, a developing baby in the womb grows a structure called the neural tube. It is this that will eventually form the spine and nervous system. But in cases of spina bifida,  the spinal column  - the bone that surrounds and protects the nerves - does not fully close. The . exact causes are unknown, but several risk factors have been . identified, the most significant being a lack of folic acid before and . at the very start of pregnancy. There are a number of different types . of spina bifida but Xiao has myelomeningocele, the most serious variant . of the condition. It affects one pregnancy in every 1,000 in Britain. Surgeon Huang Chuanping says that if they operate now the 10 cm long  'tail' it will return unless they repair the spinal canal first . Spina bifida or 'split spine' is a fault in the development of the spinal cord which leaves a gap in the spine. In Xiao's case the spinal membranes and cord have pushed out to create a sac in the baby¿s back. Myelomeningocele spina bifida causes the spinal column to remain open along the bones making up the spine. The membranes and spinal cord push out to create a sac in the baby’s back. This sometimes leaves the nervous system vulnerable to infections that may be fatal. In most cases surgery can be can close the defect but damage to the nervous system will usually already have taken place, resulting in a range of symptoms, including paralysis and incontinence. Chinese medics say the growth . at the base of Xiao's spine has been caused by damage to the outer wall of . the child's spinal canal. Surgeon Huang Chuanping explained: 'Xiao's growth is quite well developed and now measures some 10 . centimetres.' 'If we cut it off it will simply grow again. We need to . repair the spinal canal first to stop it reoccurring.'","Xiao Wei, from Southern China, was born with spina bifida - a condition that stops the spine developing normally and causes it to split .

Mark French, 47, Tony Rees, 50, and Anthony Dunn, 53, bought ingots of metal to put through their own press in an east London factory. Coins worth £10,355 were recovered and the gang processed enough metal to make £16,000 worth of counterfeit currency in a month. Mark French, 47, Tony Rees, 50, and Anthony Dunn, 53, made these fake coins out of lead with their own press at an east London factory . The men sprayed the fakes with gold and silver paint to make them look like pound or £2 coins. They disguised their factory as a garage . Tony Rees, of Upminster, was jailed for a year for his part in the coin fraud . Police had been keeping the men under observation and raided two premises - a rented business unit in Tarling Road, Canning Town, and a house in nearby Hoy Street. The business unit was disguised as a vehicle recovery garage as the men worked inside making thousands of coins, the Old Bailey heard. Royal Mint experts examined the buckets of coins and found they were crude copies. The coins would not have been accepted in a vending machine because they were magnetic and the wrong size. Father of-five Dunn rented the premises sprayed the coins and hired the two others to join the team. French, who has a previous conviction for fraudulently taking a £30,000 lorry, was also convicted of cultivating 32 cannabis plants, which he claimed was to ease his back pain. Rees, who claimed he was the operation’s ‘dogsbody’, has a previous conviction for conspiracy to make fake Euro notes. Judge Richard Hone jailed Dunn for nine months, Rees for a year and gave French a nine-month sentence suspended for two years. The judge said he took into account the coins were ‘of poor visual quality’ and that the conspiracy ran for just over a month in April of last year. He told Dunn: 'You were the prime mover in this conspiracy. You paid the rent in cash, and you engaged the assistance of your two co-defendants.' The judge told French that he took into account a recent job offer when deciding on the suspended jail term. ‘You have been friends with Tony Dunn for many years and you were drawn into this conspiracy with him,' he said. Judge Hone said Rees’s previous convictions were a serious aggravating feature. ‘But it seems to me you also were involved for only a few weeks and had the shortest role of the three defendant,’ he added. French, of Canning Town, Rees, of Upminster, and Dunn, of Stepney, all east London, admitted conspiracy to make counterfeit coins. The three men hugged each other in the dock before two of them were led away. DI Doug Blackwood, from the City of London Police, said: ‘Dunn, Rees and French had their criminal counterfeiting conspiracy all set up and were fast on their way to establishing small-scale commercial fake coin production. Mark French, left, was given a suspended sentence while Anthony Dunn, right, was jailed for nine months . French, left, and Dunn, right, were convicted alongside Tony Rees for their roles in the east London-based operation . ‘But they were rather surprised when police officers found all three of them together in the derelict warehouse where the spray painting took place.’ He added: ‘There is no doubt that they could have set up a steady production of fake coins had they not been caught. 'There were around five to eight thousand in various stages of production when officers executed a warrant at the premises. ‘It was quite a labour intensive process. Each moulded coin had to have a penny placed in the centre before it was sprayed gold and then each was finished by hand to make them appear more genuine.’ Tony Rees, left, had a previous conviction for forgery, while Dunn, right, was the 'prime mover' in the gang .","Tony Rees, 50, Anthony Dunn, 53, and Mark French, 47, convicted of crime .

The RAF has had to ground an entire fleet of training aircraft following two incidents when propellers came off in mid-flight, meaning they have been unable to teach new pilots for almost five months. Defence sources have described the grounding of the Grob 115E Tutor aircraft, which are maintained by defence contractor Babcock, as a 'complete fiasco'. The aircraft have not flown since January 9th following an incident at RAF Cranwell in Lincolnshire when a plane's propeller broke off in flight forcing an emergency landing. A Grob 115E 'Tutor'  aircraft at RAF Cranwell. The RAF's entire fleet of the German-built planes has been grounded following two incidents when propellers broke off in mid air . An almost identical incident which took place on August 23, also near RAF Cranwell, had been put down to lightning strike. And In 2004, a propeller on one of the Grobs broke up as it performed an aerobatic manouvere. Both Princes William and Harry flew Grobs at RAF Cranwell as part of their training to become helicopter pilots. The aircraft, which have a top speed of around 200mph, were introduced into the RAF in 1999. Prince William is seen next to an instructor in the cockpit of a Grob . Tutor during his training to become a helicopter rescue pilot in . 2008 . The RAF website states: 'The Tutor is a . cost-effective, modern elementary training aircraft. The combination of . docile handling characteristics and good performance make it very . suitable for its training role.' A defence source told the Times: . 'There is now a bottleneck. No military pilot has started training for . six months and there is no solution in sight.' According to the source a row has now broken out between the defence contractor Babcock and the German manufacturers about who was responsible for the failures. Safety fears: On both occasions the aircrafts' propellers broke off in mid flight . The source added: 'The aircraft are provided by Babcock under a PFI. The contract is to provide plying hours per year. 'They are wriggling out of it saying it is a design fault, which is surprising considering the the supply of flying hours is the essence of the contract.' According to the Times a second defence source suggested an attempt to fix the problem using a newly designed propeller had so far failed and that there were problems with the oil supply. An MOD spokesman said: 'The MOD can confirm that the Babcock Grob Tutor aircraft are currently undergoing a pause in flying operations whilst an on-going mechanical issue is investigated. 'The impact to the training pipeline is being mitigated by the adoption of a number of measures including the use of other platforms. 'Whilst the Tutor aircraft is not being utilised to deliver basic flying training at this time, flying training activity as a whole has not ceased. There has been no impact to the front line.' Babcock are expected to comment later today. In 2009, two teenage air cadets and two pilots were killed when two Grob Tutors collided in mid air above the Kenfig nature reserve. Following the disaster the RAF has completed a Â£2.8m safety upgrade to all its basic training aircraft.","The German-built Grob 115E Tutor aircraft have not flown since January 9th .

The British National Party has laughed off its leader Nick Griffin being declared bankrupt, joking its better than being a millionaire in a coma like Michael Shumacher. The tasteless remark about the Formula 1 star came as fans held a silent vigil outside the hospital where he is being treated for a head injury suffered in a skiing accident on Sunday. But Mr Griffin brushed aside the idea that his financial problems would end his . political career and revealed he is writing a booklet on dealing with . debts. BNP leader Nick Griffin has been declared bankrupt but insists he will stand for election to the European Parliament again in May . The outspoken politician insisted he will continue as a member of the European Parliament and run for re-election in May. As Mr Griffin's financial problems were . made public, BNP press officer Simon Darby told Huffington Post: 'Look at it this way. Michael Schumacher has millions in the bank, but he'd do . anything to be in Nick's position now wouldn't he.' Schumacher is in a critical but stable condition after suffering brain injuries in a skiing accident on Sunday. In a message coinciding with his 45th birthday, his family said they were touched by the support shown by fans. As an MEP Mr Griffin enjoys a basic salary of around £76,000, plus extra basic allowances worth £46,000 with more for travel and accommodation. A listing at the Insolvency Service showed Mr Griffin was declared bankrupt at Welshpool and Newtown County Court yesterday. The BNP said that Mr Griffin had run up debts of £120,000 to solicitors Gilbert Davies & Partners, which represented him in the early stages of legal action against the European Commission. He had offered to repay 42p for every pound he owed to all his creditors but this was rejected by the courts. The tasteless joke by BNP press officer Simon Darby came as fans of former Formula 1 champion Michael Schumacher held a vigil outside the hospital where he is being treated following a serious skiing accident on Sunday . Politicians declared bankrupt used to be barred from seeking election again, but the rules were changed in 2002 meaning it no longer prevents someone from being an MP or MEP, or standing for election. In a statement Mr Griffin said: 'This order will not prevent me fighting for the interests of the British people or leading the British National Party to a fresh round of electoral victories. 'It’s of no political significance whatsoever.  I will take whatever is thrown at me and deal with it. 'I champion the right of the British people to their land and I will never surrender. 'On a practical note, I am now much better able to advise and help the huge numbers of decent ordinary folk in my constituency who have financial difficulties of their own. 'I will be producing an advice booklet on dealing with debt very shortly and can speak from personal experience rather than from an ivory tower in Brussels.' Mr Griffin will be automatically discharged from bankruptcy in one year, on January 2 2015, in accordance with the Insolvency Act. He was elected for the North West region of England in 2009. Advice published by the Electoral Commission said bankruptcy in itself does not bar someone from being a member of the European Parliament or standing for election. Restrictions are only triggered if an individual is made subject to a bankruptcy restrictions order or debt relief restrictions order. The Insolvency Service said such orders had not been made in Mr Griffin's case.","Tasteless joke made as fans held a vigil for driver outside hospital .

When Steve McClaren took charge of Derby County just a few days after Nigel Clough was sacked, the Rams were lying in 14th place in the Championship. That was three months ago. Today, the club are sitting comfortably in the play-off places. So, bring on Jose Mourinho and the Chelsea boys in the FA Cup on Sunday. It's been some turnaround at the newly-renamed iPro Stadium. Here, NEIL MOXLEY at the reasons behind the Derby revolution... Going up?

Man Utd v Swansea (4.30pm) BT Sport 1 . There can be little doubt the arrival of the former England manager was received warmly by Derby County’s supporters. They remember fondly the input made by the Jim Smith’s assistant during the promotion push in 1995-96. The situation he walked into, along with fellow ‘Derby men’ – assistant Paul Simpson and goalkeeping coach Eric Steele – was by no means terminal. Derby were scoring plenty of goals. Indeed, they still are. What McClaren has done is tighten up the defence. The Rams have not conceded more than one goal in the league in the past two months. They used to be vulnerable without possession. Now they scamper back into their shape quickly. McClaren may have been criticised in the past for not knowing how to win matches. But he has identified that not losing them will be key for Derby County. Still walking the line: Steve McClaren in the Premier League as assistant to Derby boss Jim Smith in 1998 (left) andnow as manager (right) with his assistant Paul Simpson in the Skybet Championship . Derby’s core strength lies in their engine-room of Craig Bryson, Will Hughes and Jeff Hendrick. Bryson, a £450,000 capture from Kilmarnock, has scored 11 goals from midfield. Unlike the last person to claim that feat for the Rams, Inigo Idiakez, he has done so by grabbing them from open play. He has been ably supported by Hughes – a teenager who burst on to the scene under Nigel Clough and who may not have enjoyed the same impact this season as he did last, but he is still just 18 years of age. And completing this trio is Hendrick. Another youngster with great promise who is just working his way back to full fitness after a three-month lay-off with an ankle problem. Craig Bryson . Will Hughes . Jeff Hendrick . Yes, every successful team is likely to boast one. And in Chris Martin, the Rams have a man who is bang on the money at the moment. Martin was another whose talent was identified by Clough. However, he appears unfazed by the managerial change, having claimed 15 goals so far this season. Martin has also missed a couple of penalties, which would put him within sight of becoming the first Derby striker to score 20 goals in a season since Dean Sturridge in 1995-96, when the Rams were promoted. Martin may not be the quickest but he is very good with his back to goal and adept at finding team-mates who are clever enough to find the space to receive the ball from him. Players such as those midfielders listed above. Goal machine: Chris Martin, who has scored 15 goals for Derby already this term, scores his team's fourth in the Championship match against Blackpool last month . John Eustace originally joined Derby with a view to earning a contract.

Derby have appointed a new chief executive, Sam Rush, a former agent with Wasserman whose decision it was to dispense with Clough’s services. Many commentators – including this one – felt that it was harsh, given the financial constraints under which the former England forward had been working. He put the building blocks of Derby's success so far this season in place and, to be fair to McClaren, he has repeatedly acknowledged this. But any chief executive has tough decisions to make. Rush has overseen the re-branding of Pride Park and, at present, has to be in credit following McClaren’s appointment.

So, who are we to argue? That is borne out in the attendances. There has been little to shout about for the Rams during the past few years but their average crowd of 24,346 is the third largest in the Championship behind Leeds United and Brighton and Hove Albion. It is a reflection of the fact that Derby had been banging in goals that it is just 1,000 better than the figure achieved under Clough. Needless to say, the iPro Stadium will be packed out for the visit of Chelsea on Sunday.","Holy trinity: Bryson, Hughes and Hendrick powering side up Championship .

Manchester United are waiting eagerly on the results of Wayne Rooney's groin scan after the striker was spotted leaving a hospital in Manchester on Friday. Rooney is almost certain to miss the FA Cup clash with Swansea after playing through the pain barrier in the 2-1 defeat by Tottenham at Old Trafford. He has been one of the few positives so far this season for boss Moyes, who looks destined to fail in his bid to retain the title in his first season in charge of the Barclays Premier League champions.

United have won 15 of those games. And with Robin van Persie also out, Rooney's injury could not have come at a worse time for Moyes. Moyes revealed this week that Rooney had a groin injury but admitted that he simply can't afford to play without the talismanic forward as his side continue to toil. After missing the 1-0 victory at Norwich on Saturday, Rooney did not train in the build-up to the New Years Day defeat Spurs, but the United boss restored the striker to the starting line-up on Wednesday evening and he played the full ninety minutes as United fell to a sixth Premier League loss of the season. 'He has got a bit of a groin injury but the longer it went on, we had to try and get more attacking players on the pitch to try and find more ways score,' Moyes revealed.

When asked if the England man would benefit from a more expended period to recover, Moyes admitted he is reluctant to do without United's most influential forward: 'If I could, I would.

Somalia to fight pirates are 'nonsense' Former lieutenant Chris Enmarch’s decommissioned gunboat Defender raised suspicions among Spanish authorities last week after he was forced to stop off in Tenerife for repairs. Civil Guard officers have carried out five inspections of the vessel and have refused to allow the heavily armoured converted warship to sail. But Mr Enmarch, 53, of Penryn, Cornwall, said the Spanish authorities were making a 'fuss about nothing' and said the cannons on his boat were 'just for show and totally unusable'. Angry: Chris Enmarsh, 53, said it was 'nonsense' to suggest he was intending to use his boat to fight Somali pirates . Following background checks on Mr Enmarsh, the Spanish authorities are believed to have been concerned by comments he made to a local newspaper in Essex in . 2011 that he intended to arm it for shipping and oil rig protection. He told the Maldon Chronicle in . November 2011: ‘Defender’s task will be to deter any pirates intent on . boarding the many ships that pass the East African coastline. One look . at her should be enough to send them looking for easier targets. ‘She will be manned by handpicked . ex-Royal Marine Commandos and run as a professional naval ship, obeying . the rules of engagement. ‘Our primary task will be to protect . oil platforms which are towed close to the coast of East Africa, and a . number of oil companies want to hire Defender to look after their . interests. ‘We are not mercenaries; this is . strictly a business venture similar to other British private protection . firms which operate in Iraq and Afghanistan.’ But yesterday Mr Enmarsh told The Times it was a 'fuss about nothing' and said the Spanish authorities had gone 'totally overboard over nothing whatsoever.' He said: ‘The reports of us heading to . Somalia are nonsense. We would not have come down this way if our . destination was the Horn of Africa. There are quicker routes to get . there. ‘We are on our way from England to . Senegal to discuss with the authorities there the possible use of the . Defender as a deterrent against illegal fishing boats. 'The idea is that . one look at us and anyone who should not be fishing there will think . twice about staying. ‘We have been searched from . top to bottom and nothing improper has been found. The only reason we . have to stay is because the inspectors say our on-board safety equipment . is not up to standard. Eight former Royal Marines are understood to be on board the vessel, which was heading to East Africa to protect oil platforms on the East African coastline from pirates . Mr Enmarsh said the cannons on his boat were 'just for show' and 'totally unusable' ‘We need to get new fire extinguishers . and some other items before we are cleared to depart. The crew have not . been detained in any way.’ The 127ft boat, which weighs 135 tons, . was built in Lowestoft, Suffolk, in the mid-Seventies as a fast attack . craft for the Sultan of Oman’s navy in the Gulf. The ship was decommissioned in 2002. Mr Enmarch is thought to have bought it two years ago. Local maritime officials impounded the . vessel last week after an inspection found ‘administrative . irregularities’ and security issues relating to life-saving equipment. The drama began on Tuesday, April 23 . when the Defender made an unplanned stopover in the resort of Los . Cristianos after blowing a gasket. It was boarded by Spanish Civil Guard . officers and refused permission to stay there. The vessel was then . escorted to a berth 50 miles away at Santa Cruz port by a Spanish navy . warship. Officials are understood to have been . suspicious that the formidable looking vessel, which flies the British . flag, was registered as a pleasure boat. The boat has been inspected five times . but officials have refused the skipper permission to sail. Mr Enmarch . and his five-man crew have not been held.

"Company have battled for one year to win trademark company name . By . Richard  Shears . UPDATED: . 08:01 EST, 18 January 2012 . A nutty snack company in Australia has won the right to call itself Nuckin Futs, despite an official ruling that it was offensive. A solicitor representing the Gold Coast company argued that the name was not offensive because the words it suggested were commonplace in everyday Australian language. The Trade Marks Examiner had ruled a year ago that Nuckin Futs had to be rejected because it was scandalous and offensive due to its close resemblance to the common phrase f--king nuts. Must be nuts: An Australian snack firm has won the right to market itself as Nucking Futs . The examiner, who has not been named, ruled that Nuckin Futs was an 'obvious spoonerism' and therefore was ineligible for registration under section 42 of the Trade Marks Act. The Act states that anything that is regarded as shameful, offensive or shocking to ordinary people had to be rejected. Solicitor Jamie White did not agree with the finding and began a 12-month campaign on behalf of the company to get the name registered. The suggested words were part of the everyday language of Australians, he considered, and drew up a five-page legal document cataloguing the history of controversial product names. He argued that the words 'f--k' and 'f--king' were 'now part of the universal discourse of the ordinary Australian.' Solicitor Director Jamie White made the case on behalf on Nuckin Futs . While there might be a sentimental objection or mere distaste to Nuckin Futs, he said, this was not sufficient ground for rejection of the Trade Mark. He added that 'a substantial number of people would not find the words shocking.' 'Over the passage of time, certain words which may have caused major offence in earlier times would now be acceptable as trade marks in certain markets, namely the Australian market,' Mr White told Sydney's Daily Telegraph. It has taken almost a year but after rejecting the initial application, the Trade Marks Examiner has now agreed to accept the Nuckin Futs trademark - as long as the company does not aim its marketing at children.Mr White said that would not happen. He explained that the snack, which is made up mostly of nuts, would not be marketed to children as it was intended to be sold only in pubs, nightclubs and other entertainment venues. Australians writing to a comment page said they found it strange that Nuckin Futs had to fight for registration, while French Connection UK- which carries the brand name FCUK - was widely accepted in the community. 'Really, people need to lighten up and stop being so politically correct all the time,' said one man. Another, Rob Lapaer, used his own Spoonerism by describing the affair as being 'mucking afazing.' But Andrew Baker of Sydney said: 'It's people like this that are responsible for the moral decay in society these days. Not only should the company name not be registered but the man should be fined heavily as well.'",Company have battled for one year to win trademark company name .

Get running even if you hate it: Ruth Field offers a no-nonsense approach to exercise (posed by model) If your New Year's resolution is to get fit, eat healthily and lose weight, it's time to stop making excuses and start getting tough on yourself according to author Ruth Field. The criminal barrister from North London believes running is the answer for anyone who wants to get in shape. In her book, Run Fat B!tch Run, she offers a no nonsense approach to getting moving in the guise of her 'inner b***h' The Grit Doctor. She writes: 'Really I am just naming that voice we all have inside our heads. Yours may be lying dormant or suffocating under all that excess weight but it is there. It's that nagging little voice which makes you feel just a tad uncomfortable about helping yourself to another biscuit.' Ruth said people have to tap into this nagging voice and use it to motivate themselves to get off the sofa. And not by going to low intensity exercises or by joining a gym (then never going) but by running. The 38-year-old mother of twins took up running herself in her mid twenties after agreeing to do a marathon. And while she's now a convert to the sport, she's not always evangelical about it. She told MailOnline: 'I wouldn't say I enjoy running but I enjoy the benefits that running brings such as getting outdoors and feeling healthier. I certainly didn't enjoy it when I first started. I can honestly say I hated every single one of those early runs as they were incredibly difficult and I was out of breath within minutes feeling like I was on the verge of a heart attack.' As she's loathe to call running 'fun', Ruth will not take anyone complaining that they 'hate running' as an excuse for not giving it a go. 'Everyone hates it until they have practised it religiously for sometime,' she admits. She also has a comeback for the other excuses people peddle out for not being active, such as 'I don't have time' ('Everyone has the same 24 hours a day, President Obama finds the time and I guarantee he has more to get done in a given day than you do in an entire week') and 'I don't have the right build for running' ('There's no such thing as the right build. It's an excuse often used by large breasted ladies but I once ran with a double E cup friend who wore two sports bras.'). Despite the title of the book, Ruth has never been obese in her life but admits there have been times when she has needed to lose a few pounds. And she's learnt the best way to tackle weightloss is not through faddy diets. She again points to running being the answer here as runners tend to crave less sugary treats because of the feel-good factor they can get from running and tend to seek healthy foods as fuel to help them run. Toughen up: Ruth, left, had to embrace her 'inner b***h' The Grit Doctor in order to run a marathon and reveals how you can do the same in her book . For those who haven't reached this stage yet and are failing to lose weight despite taking up running, The Grit Doctor has some tough but honest advice: 'If you are consuming fizzy drinks, crisps and takeaways as part of your daily diet, this is the reason you are not losing as much weight as you would expect from running alone. Frankly, as an adult you should be ashamed of yourself if you are still buying sweets and fizzy drinks on a weekly basis. Stop it now.' Ruth said her tips are just common sense - move more and eat less junk food - but believes many people need to stop deluding themselves in order to achieve it. Thus she has no time for people who say they are overweight because they are 'big-boned' ('You may be big-boned but you may also be fat. Being big-boned is no excuse for being overweight') or 'have a slow metabolism' ('Bulls***. You are overweight because you eat too much of the wrong food.') Stop kidding yourself: The book takes a common sense approach to weightloss and advises against making excuses over food indulgences . Run Fat Bitch Run contains recipes to help readers stay on track and advice on the right foods to eat to help them run better. The book was first published in 2012 but has been re-released this month to include a marathon training plan and is also now available as an eBook. It's through her own marathon training - for London and then New York - that Ruth finally discovered she could enjoy running - or at least enjoy the sense of achievement and lifestyle changes it brings. 'The real joy of the marathon is that you have done it and having done it is going to become a metaphor for you and the rest of your life. A metaphor that says you can achieve anything that you set your mind to provided you put in the effort,' she said. Ruth intends to tackle another marathon to celebrate her 40th birthday but in the meantime is happier running shorter distances. Persevere: Ruth admits she hated running at first but it does get easier and the benefits are multiple (posed by model) For anyone who does take up running this January, she advises not trying to go too fast too soon and not just entering a marathon. She said: 'Many people decide to go out for a run and then go sprinting off down the street at a pace they are only able to maintain for a minute. They then give up and go home because they can't keep it up. It's much better to start at a slow pace, not much quicker than walking, and then speed up as you get fitter.' On entering a marathon she added: 'Having the marathon as your goal will certainly motivate you - it worked for me. But there are plenty of other races of other distances that you can target. The most important thing is just to get started and then make running become a habit.' A new and updated version of Run Fat B!tch Run is now available as a paperback and Ebook via Amazon, published by Sphere . Despite the best intentions, many people may take up running this week and give up by mid January due to lack of motivation and support. But it doesn't have to be that way thanks to Jantastic - a free running challenge for all abilities that's being launched on Monday. Jantastic.me is a new socially integrated website where runners around the world can link up to share advice and keep one another going.

Smiling: The Queen presents the Duke of Edinburgh with the Order of New Zealand award at Buckingham Palace in central London yesterday . Most people heading for hospital – be they 19 or 91 – would probably prefer not to have tea with 8,000 people en route. But yesterday afternoon, the Duke of Edinburgh was at the Queen’s side as they plunged into a traditional Buckingham Palace garden party with a cross-section of British life, from actor Benedict Cumberbatch to a group of Scottish Girl Guides. In perfect sunshine, to the clink of teacups and the gentle airs of the Band of the Coldstream Guards, it was very much business as usual. Certainly none of the guests – myself included – had the faintest idea the Duke might be en route to the London Clinic for up to a fortnight. Garden parties follow a time-honoured format and yesterday’s was no different. On the stroke of 4pm, the Queen and the Duke appeared through the doors on to the West Terrace with the Earl and Countess of Wessex. The tea tent emptied, the crowds ground to a standstill and all 8,000 of us stood to attention for the national anthem. Then the royal team divided into different ‘lanes’ through the crowds, each one staked out by the Yeomen of the Guard in full Tudor rig. For a full sun-baked hour, the Queen, the duke and the Wessexes made snail-like progress through the throng – five deep in places and all eager for a handshake and a chat. It is a well-oiled machine. The Gentlemen Ushers, retired gents from the Forces, pluck out a varied selection of guests and senior royal officials do the introductions. See video below . Arrival: On the stroke of 4pm, the Queen and the Duke appeared through the doors on to the West Terrace . Yesterday, as usual, the duke was accompanied by his private secretary, Brigadier Archie Miller-Bakewell, as he chatted to dozens of guests, among them a little group from the British Association of Dairy Farmers and a couple of alumni from his old Scottish school, Gordonstoun. It’s always a broad church in the Duke’s lane. Yesterday’s assembly included the British Gliding Association, the Burma Star Association, the Canada Club and the Surf Lifesaving Association of Great Britain. Also presented were a small contingent from Trinity House, which looks after every lighthouse in England and Wales. An assiduous past patron, the Duke was at one of their dinners just two nights earlier. As chatty and boisterous as ever, the Duke worked his way down the entire lane but even then there was no respite. While many of us had long since sought a chair, a bit of shade, a plate of cucumber sandwiches (sans crust), a raspberry tartlet and a bit of Dundee cake – plus a cup of tea or a glass of the Palace’s famous iced coffee – the Queen and the Duke were then ushered into the Royal Tent. Gathering: For a full sun-baked hour, the Queen, the duke and the Wessexes made snail-like progress through the throng - five deep in places and all eager for a handshake and a chat . Here, they remained on their feet for another 40 minutes, working their way through a VIP crowd. Among those invited yesterday were the new Archbishop of Canterbury and his wife plus Cabinet ministers Danny Alexander, Justine Greening and Eric Pickles (with ‘Two Teas Pickles’ on the list, let’s hope they’d ordered in extra chocolate eclairs and scones). As chatty and boisterous as ever, the Duke worked his way down the entire lane but even then there was no respite . Next door, in the Diplomatic Tent, a cross-section of High Commissioners and ambassadors swapped gossip and looked on while the Coldstream Guards moved on to Star Wars and Phantom of the Opera. Finally, at 5.45, the duke escorted the Queen back through the gardens. As always, they paused to chat to the guests in wheelchairs who are always offered pride of place alongside the homeward path by the Palace swimming pool. And then the crowds slowly enjoyed one last meander round the gardens in the evening breeze. It might be a charming Edwardian idyll for the 8,000 guests but it is always hard work for the hosts. And the largest garden party of the season is yet to come next month – for up to 10,000 at Holyroodhouse. Let’s hope the duke is back on his feet in time for that. By then he will be 92. Would it be impertinent to offer him a chair?","Duke of Edinburgh was with Queen at Buckingham Palace garden party .

A new method of carrying out male circumcision without the need for surgery has been approved by the World Health Organisation. The PrePex circumcision device uses an . elastic band to cut off the blood supply to the foreskin until it dies . and falls off, or can be cut off painlessly. It is hoped the device will help to reduce the spread of HIV in Africa because being circumcised reduces a heterosexual man’s risk of becoming infected by 60 per cent. The PrePex device works by using an elastic band to cut off the blood supply to the foreskin which causes it to die meaning it falls off, or can be cut away painlessly. It takes two nurses just four minutes to fit the device . The technique does not require a general anaesthetic and is believed to be safer than surgery. The New York Times reports that the device can be put in place by two nurses who require little training, it only takes four minutes to apply, it is disposable, and there is no need for sterile conditions. It is also cheap compared to surgery and the device is easy to ship and store. The manufacturer also claims there are no needles involved and no loss of blood, the patient can return immediately to their daily routine, and it does not require the use of unsightly stitches or sutures. Circ MedTech, the social enterprise that created PrePex, claims that 25 million people have already died of AIDS and that another two million people are infected every year. In 2007, the WHO reported that male circumcision in high risk parts of African can reduce the risk of HIV infection by 60 per cent. The reason for this is that the . foreskin acts as HIV’s main entry point to the body during penetrative . sex between an uninfected man and an HIV-infected person. This is because the inner surface of the foreskin contains a higher proportion of the cells that HIV targets, such as T-cells. It is hoped that the device will slow the spread of HIV in Sub-Saharan Africa as heterosexual men in high-risk areas are 60 per cent less likely to become infected if they are circumcised . It also has less keratin, a protein found in the skin, which has a protective effect. Circumcision can also reduce the likelihood of genital ulcers, which increase HIV risk by creating a break in the skin through which the virus can enter the body. In addition, any small tears in the foreskin that occur during sex make it much easier for the virus to enter the body. However, surgical circumcision requires surgeons working in sterile surgical conditions – something which is often not available in the parts of Sub-Saharan Africa where HIV is most prevalent. In 2011 UNAIDS, the US Government, the WHO, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, and the World Bank launched an action plan to carry out 20 million voluntary circumcisions by 2015. They believe this will save 3.4 million lives and US$16.5 billion in long term healthcare costs. Circ MedTech believes that the PrePex offers a ‘safe, simple and scalable’ way of achieving this goal.","The World Health Organisation has approved the PrePex device for use .

From cracking the German Enigma code to eavesdropping on Japanese communications, the Bletchley Park code breakers contributed to some of the biggest Allied victories of the World War II. But until relatively recently, much of the codebreakers' work remained shrouded in mystery - and the role of women most of all. Now ITV drama The Bletchley Circle is set to shine a light on the contribution of the 9,000 women who worked at Bletchley Park during World War II, although as historian and author Michael Smith explains, fact, in this instance, is even more fascinating than fiction. Drama: ITV's The Bletchley Circle is set to shine a light on the contribution of the 9,000 women who worked at Bletchley Park during World War II . The real heroines: Women played a key part in code-breaking that led to Allied victories . 'Women played a variety of roles from lowly clerks to operating machines and breaking into ciphers and codes - the highest level of work you could do at Bletchley Park,' he explains. Among the women working at the highest level was Mavis Batey, a Londoner who arrived at Bletchley Park aged just 19 years old, and who died last November at the age of 92. 'She was one of the top codebreakers at Bletchley,' explains Smith. 'She's frequently described as one of the leading female codebreakers but I don't think that's fair – she was one of the leading codebreakers full stop.' Working closely with Alfred Dillwyn 'Dilly' Knox, at the time one of the world's top experts in ciphers, she was instrumental in unearthing the intelligence that helped Britain to a spectacular naval victory over the Italians at Matapan. But her greatest triumph came in December 1941 when she deciphered a message sent from Belgrade to Berlin that allowed Knox and his team to decrypt the output of the Abwehr [German secret service] Enigma machine. Vital work: Women played a variety of roles from lowly clerks to operating machines and breaking into ciphers and codes . Thanks to Batey and Knox, British intelligence was able to monitor Abwehr activities and even plant false information – something that would later prove crucial to the success of D Day. It could even, as Smith points out, have helped prevent nuclear war in Europe. 'The key thing in all of this is that [decrypting Enigma] allowed D Day to go ahead,' he reveals. 'Without it, it might well have been put back two years. Bear in mind, this was at a time when the UK and USA were developing the atomic bomb which was later used on Japan. 'It's not at all clear they wouldn't have used it on Germany if they thought it necessary.' Despite the heroic efforts of Batey and fellow code breakers such as Rozanne Colchester and Gwendoline Page, the work of female code breakers wasn't always given the recognition it deserved at the time. 'In the 1940s and 50s, ordinary life . meant getting married, having children but never again having the sort . of life they had at Bletchley' Although there was what Smith describes as a 'collegiate atmosphere' and women were free to challenge their male colleagues as they saw fit, they were paid a third less than the men and after the war ended, many melted back into ordinary life. By the 1950s, when the new series of The Bletchley Circle begins, most had become mothers and housewives - Mavis Batey among them. Sadly, of the 9,000 women who worked at Bletchley Park during World War II, just 600 went on to join the fledgling GCHQ or other branches of the secret services. 'These women had to really play down their amazing abilities, their strengths and minds,' reveals actress Sophie Rundle who plays former code breaker Lucy. 'They had to pretend they hadn't done anything special in the war and that means Lucy has to downplay her intelligence. She is upholding the Official Secrets Act.' Back to reality: Of the 9,000 women who worked at Bletchley Park during World War II, just 600 went on to join the fledgling GCHQ or other branches of the secret services . Groundbreaking: But the work of female codebreakers wasn't always given the recognition it deserved at the time. 'Unless they went on into GCHQ, most of the women went back into ordinary life,' explains Smith. 'It became a brief thing that didn't reflect their ordinary lives. It meant most of them had more life experience, cultural interests and so on than they might have done. 'But in the 1940s and 50s, ordinary life meant getting married, having children but never again having the sort of life they had at Bletchley.' And it wasn't only the women who missed the fascinating life they had enjoyed while working at Bletchley Park. 'One of great Americans who worked at Bletchley was Bill Bundy, who later became a senior policy advisor to President Kennedy,' adds Smith. 'He once said nothing he did post-war matched up to what he did at Bletchley Park. If he can say that, just imagine what it was like for an ordinary housewife. 'It's astonishing how people could do something so extraordinary for five years and then go back to being ordinary.' Ordinary their later lives might have been but nothing can detract from the incredible contribution made by the 9,000 women who spent the war years at Bletchley Park. The Bletchley Circle starts on Monday at 9pm on ITV . Until recently, the work of the men and women who worked at Bletchley Park in Buckinghamshire was a well-kept secret. But . thanks to the declassification of wartime documents, the exploits of . the code breakers – and the magnificent contribution they made – have . finally been given the recognition they deserve. The story of Bletchley Park began in late 1938 when a group of MI6 operatives decamped to the house for a shooting party. Museum: The house has now been taken over by the Bletchley Park Trust . Among . them were men from an organisation called the Government Code and . Cypher School (GC&CS) whose job it was to assess the Georgian . building's suitability for becoming the headquarters of a secret group . of top level code breakers. It was deemed ideal and by September 1939, GC&CS, the forerunner of GCHQ, returned to start their work in earnest. By . the end of 1940, 12,000 people worked at Bletchley and its sub-camps, . whether as cooks and support staff or as code breakers decrypting the . military codes and ciphers that secured German, Japanese, and other Axis . nation's communications. Others . operated the incredibly sophisticated machines that were the . forerunners of modern computers, including the Turing/Welchman Bombe, . and the groundbreaking Colossus machine. By . the end of the war, GC&CS' code breaking expertise had become a key . part of intelligence operations and had helped bring World . War II to a close. Sadly, Bletchley Park itself was eventually deemed surplus to requirements with operations later moved to Cheltenham. Abandoned . by GCHQ, the house passed through several owners, including BT, but by . the 1990s was practically derelict and at risk of demolition. The . buildings were rescued, after the site was declared a conservation area . by Milton Keynes council in 1992 and taken over by the Bletchley Park . Trust which has since turned the building into a museum dedicated to the . exploits of the men and women who helped Britain and its allies.

Most women only replace their make-up when it runs out, however long that might take and a new survey has highlighted that the majority of women are unaware of a beauty product's shelf life, putting them at risk of anything from a painful eye infection to . a disfiguring skin complaint. When questioned 78 per cent of women had no idea that their make-up had a shelf life at all. And even though 22 per cent of . respondents were aware of their product's expiry dates, a shocking 82 . per cent said they still kept the . products well past their use by date. Best before: A staggering 78 per cent of women are unsure of their make-up's shelf life, meaning they risk infection . Furthermore, when asked to stipulate why . they kept their products past their sell by date, a third of the . women polled admitted that they ‘didn’t want to waste the product’, . while 26 per cent said they ‘couldn’t afford to replace it’. A canny 18 per cent of respondents . said they believed that the expiry date was just ‘a ploy’ to get . consumer to spend more while 11 per cent said the product was still usable even . after the use by date.

'Although it may be costly to throw out expired makeup, especially if they are designer brands, these expiry dates are put in place for a reason. 'If you have too many products that are close to expiring, then perhaps you should cut down on your beauty spending habits. At the end of the day, you are only throwing away your money!' Dr Hilary Allan – Cosmetic Dermatologist, Woodford Medical Aesthetics said: 'All quality cosmeceutical skincare products should be used within 6 months of opening. 'The big problem is that these products contain advanced ingredients such as Retinol and Vitamin C that lose their potency if left to oxygenate over time. 'Meaning they simply won’t do what they should. This is particularly important when using a moisturiser with SPF as you are expecting it to protect you in the sun – it won’t! 'Another point to mention is that through the oxygenation process the products may separate which can cause allergic reactions on the skin.' Emma Leslie, beauty editor at online cosmetics shop Escentual.com, added: 'Old make-up can become a breeding ground for bacteria, especially eye products which if shared or kept for a long time can spread infections. So it's not just a fashion thing. 'Be ruthless and honest with yourself and don’t be a hoarder! Ask yourself : When was the last time you used it? Does it suit you?

Pub regulars are to be given the . chance to buy and run their local as David Cameron unveiled a . £250million fund to stop community facilities closing down. The Prime Minister said he wanted local people to be able to own shops, village halls, playing fields and even swimming pools. Mr . Cameron insisted he had not given up on his often-mocked Big Society . vision, and vowed to ‘fight’ opponents who refused to back him. Cheers: David Cameron, pictured leaving outside Number 10 today with comedian David Walliams and the Enough Food for Everyone IF campaign, used a speech to announce £250million to buy shops and pubs by 2020 . Money from dormant bank accounts has helped to swell the coffers of Big Society Capital which is bankrolling the idea for a decade, with funding from the Big Lottery Fund. In a speech on social investment funds, Mr Cameron said £250million would be available until 2020 to ‘help communities with ambitions to own local assets like pubs, shops, community centres and affordable housing’. The money – paid out in grants or loans – will help people in towns, villages and cities to buy and run facilities which are no longer financially viable as a business. Some of the money from the lottery fund will go into grants to support projects which cannot be expected to turn a profit. But £50 million of the money will go into a community asset fund to provide grants and loans to help get projects off the ground which could go on to be commercially viable over the long term. Mr Cameron said: ‘Everyone knows how vital institutions in our towns and villages are, like village halls, playing fields, local pubs. ‘And everyone knows how - despite the best efforts of parish and local councils - these can face closure.’ Dream: Pub locals would be able to run their local if it closes down while residents could buy playing fields to stop them being developed . He insisted that using public money to help people to take over and run pubs and shops was not ‘some pipe dream’. ‘Already there are 311 community-owned shops,18 community-owned pubs, as well as community owned bookshops, cafes, swimming pools, bakers, farmers markets, even community owned broadband networks,’ he added. He highlighted Fenham Swimming pool in Newcastle, which was closed by Newcastle City Council in 2003. It was saved by a community group but it came under financial pressure. Investment from Big Society Capital meant they were able to install solar panels to heat the pool, reduce their running costs and make it financially viable as a community centre. Mr Cameron said he hoped that the new funding will mean that ‘projects like this will be possible not in just in one community – but in every community across the country’. Splash: Mr Cameron praised Fenham swimming pool in Newcastle, which was saved by local people after being shut by the local council . Speaking to a Social Impact Investment Forum staged in London as part of the UK's chairmanship of the G8, Mr Cameron also announced a consultation on new tax breaks for social enterprises. And he welcomed the launch, supported by the London Stock Exchange, of the world's first social stock exchange, which will showcase social impact businesses and provide a means for potential investors to measure their success. The Prime Minister launched a staunch defence of the Big Society, which formed the centrepiece of his leadership in opposition but appeared to have been quietly shelved after the financial crash. Tory strategists have said the focus must be on the economy, immigration and welfare. But Mr Cameron defied his critics – including many in the Conservative party – to signal that the Big Society will remain a key feature of his premiership. ‘Some people occasionally ask me whether I still believe with the same passion in the vision of building a bigger and stronger society. I'm absolutely prepared to fight for this. Social investment can be a great force for social change, it can help us to build the bigger and stronger societies we want to see.","Prime Minister insists he has not given up on often-mocked Big Society .

An alleged carjacker came off second best when he threatened to harm Dorothy Baker's young children. Not only did she manage to wrestle a knife from him but ran him over with her minivan as he attempted to flee. 'He messed with the wrong witch,' said Dorothy Baker, from Baytown, Texas. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Don't mess with Texas: Mother-of-six Dorothy Baker was terrified for her children when she managed to fight of a would-be carjacker . The terrifying ordeal began after Baker drove home from a local CVS after shopping with her sons, five-year-old Xavier and Jayden, two. A man who had been hiding at the back of the minivan crept up on her and brandished a knife demanding money. 'I asked him how much he needed and he said $200,' Baker said. 'And I told him I didnâ€™t have that kind of cash, I had about $20 in my account, and he said I better figure out a way to get it, or my kids were going to get hurt.' As she drove along the alleged attacker Ismael Martinez, 53, climbed into the front passenger seat. He noticed Baker had dialed 911 on her cell phone and the pair began to struggle. Baker said she was able to wrestle the knife Martinez's hand, but was slashed across the chest. She punched him in the face and ordered him out of her car. Carjacker: Ismael Martinez allegedly tried to make Dorothy Baker give him $200 as he directed her around the streets of Baytown from the back of her car where he'd been lying in wait . The armed robber jumped from the minivan empty-handed and ran off. Baker said she suddenly realized that if he got away he might strike again. 'He kind of zagged and I turned, intending to clip him in the side or something to get him to stop,' she said. 'And I ended up running completely over him.' Ismael Martinez was taken to Memorial Hermann hospital via Life Flight, where he was listed in stable condition. Records reveal Martinez was jailed for a 1976 rape conviction.

Unexpected: Baker was shopping in her local neighborhood when the attack happened . 'She actually overpowered him. At some point in time, he jumped from the vehicle and was run over by the vehicle.' Baker says she only wanted to stop Martinez, and never intended to seriously harm him. At the CVS where Baker had been shopping before being carjacked others praised her for protecting her children. 'That's scary, it's really scary,' said Baytown resident Dottie Sparks. 'But good for her!' Another Baytown local Joyce Sparks added, 'She's trying to protect herself and her kids. I'd do the same thing.' Husband: Baker's husband Charles Flugence said he's very proud of his wife for her bravery . Martinez was airlifted to Memorial Hermann Hospital in Houston with serious injuries after the alleged attack. He is expected to face felony charges once he is discharged. The children were unhurt in the incident, and their father is thankful for his wife's actions. 'She's my hero. I'll take her anywhere. I'll take her anywhere twice on Sunday,' said Charles Flugence.

The story of the Ashes has been the same for England from first to last and it followed a dismally familiar pattern for them on the first day of the last Test when they wasted a clear opportunity to bowl Australia out cheaply. England backed up their promise to usher in a new era, with the Ashes long gone, by picking three debutants in the same match for the first time in seven years but they could not avert the same old script unfolding at the SCG. When Australia had crashed to 97 for five after Alastair Cook had finally won a toss the door was open for England to force a consolation win and avoid the horrible spectre of a 5-0 Ashes humiliation against a less than great side. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Paul Newman: England have an opportunity to win this Test . Day to remember: Ben Stokes salutes the travelling England supporters after a wonderful day . Six appeal: Ben Stokes was devastating for England, taking six wickets as Australia were out for 326 . Trudging off: Michael Carberry (foreground) slopes back to the pavilion after being dismissed . Immovable object: Steve Smith was in fine form, reaching his century in Sydney . But with Brad Haddin, perhaps a more . worthy man of the series than even Mitchell Johnson, again proving a . formidable obstacle to England and Steve Smith scoring his third century . in six Tests the Australian recovery was close to complete as they . hurried to 326 all out, with Ben Stokes taking six wickets. But there was a horrible start to their innings when Michael Carberry was out for a duck, caught at leg-slip by Nathan Lyon off Mitchell Johnson, and England went in eight for one. Not . since Alastair Cook, Monty Panesar and, lest we forget, Ian Blackwell . made their debuts in Nagpur in 2006 have England fielded three debutants . in the same match and the results of two the trio were mixed to say the . least. Nice work: Smith watches a beauty of a pull shot in his imperious spell at the crease . Gotcha: Jimmy Anderson's massive appeal pays off as Shane Watson is dismissed early on . Finally: Brad Haddin and Smith stopped the Australian rot with a robust partnership for Australia . England left out . Panesar and Tim Bresnan, both of whose Test days may now be numbered, . and more surprisingly Joe Root with, as expected, Gary Ballance, Scott . Borthwick and Boyd Rankin coming in and taking England’s tally of . players used here to a record 18 for an overseas series. It . would be wrong to expect instant results from such inexperienced . players but Rankin in particular had the debut of his worst nightmares . while Borthwick, who turned into more of a batsman than leg-spinner for . Durham last season, showed that he is far from the finished article as a . bowler. No England player . can match Simon Kerrigan’s introduction at The Oval last summer for pure . misery but Rankin, making his bow at the highest level at 29, came . close by having to twice leave the field mid-over with hamstring . trouble. England had not . trusted any of their three giant fast bowlers to play since Chris . Tremlett’s less than auspicious performance in Brisbane but they gave . the Irishman his chance despite concerns about his fragility in a . five-day contest. It was an . understandable selection but what was a concern was the sight of Rankin . in conversation with the England physio, doctor and team director Andy . Flower in the nets ahead of the day’s play. If there were genuine . worries about his fitness before the game then Rankin should not have . played here. It emerged afterwards that he had cramp and had not torn his hamstring as first feared . It did not seem . to matter when England had an excellent first session, taking four . wickets, and when they added a fifth almost straight after lunch, but the . emergence of Haddin seemed to scramble the brains of the bowlers and . rob them of all their discipline and control. First . they started to bowl too short at the fiery wicketkeeper and then engaged him . in yet another verbal battle on which he has thrived throughout a . series in which he has scored at least one half century in every Test. It . was terrible cricket from England as they allowed Haddin and Smith, who . has answered all doubts about his ability as a Test No 5, to add 128 for . the sixth wicket at four an over and probably change the course of this . Test. The long walk: Stokes pumps his fist as Michael Clarke makes his way back to the pavilion . Early on: Alastair Cook and Clarke read through their teams before the first ball is bowled . Not too shabby: Here's how Smith reached 115 in the Hawk-Eye wagon wheel . Calamity: Boyd Rankin's Test debut was cut short after the bowler picked up an injury . Heartbreak: Rankin cuts a dejected figure as the England medical staff give him a once over . A side can rarely . have dominated a five-Test series to such an extent with such an average . top six as Australia and their limitations were in evidence again as . David Warner’s footwork was horribly exposed, Chris Rogers was a bit . unlucky to play on, Michael Clarke looked uncomfortable against pace and . Shane Watson became England’s first lbw victim of the series. When . George Bailey, who has struggled in his first Test series, became . Stuart Broad’s second wicket England were on top, as they have been so . often on this tour with the ball in their hand. But Haddin, and then . Smith, changed all that. Stokes . has been a ray of light amid the gloom of this series and he too showed . that he has much to learn with the ball when he bowled inconsistently . at times and gave away four no balls with his habit of knocking the . bails with his hand in his delivery stride. Another dubutant: Scott Borthwick watches after bowling in his first ever Ashes Test . Popular figure: Kevin Pietersen gets ready for a picture with some Coca Cola girls . Say cheese: During a break in the play, Pietersen poses with some fans at the SCG . But, . with Rankin indisposed and Jimmy Anderson being sucked into bowling too . short at Haddin, England needed their rookie all-rounder to stand up . and be counted. Stokes, scorer of a mature century in Perth, did not . disappoint. Stokes, who had . induced that fatal pull from Rogers and had taken the key wicket of . Clarke, added Haddin after he had made his sixth half-century in seven . innings in this series before finishing the Australian innings with . three wickets in an over. The Durham man was even on a hat-trick when he . dismissed Peter Siddle first ball but quickly added Smith after Lyon had kept him out. His . team-mate at Durham, Borthwick, had claimed his first Test wicket in his . fifth over, recovering from an opening spell in which he conceded 21 . runs in three overs, when Johnson hit him straight up in the . air. Near miss: Smith evades a bouncing ball from Stuart Broad . Top team: Smith (left) and Haddin (right) elevated the Australians' total after an early struggle . It had been a shock . when England dropped Root but the fact is he had become as shot as the . bulk of the other England players in this series while they clearly . wanted to have one last look at Carberry before consigning him . to the list of players they will draw a line under following this . series. That look did not . last long as Johnson, his rise from joke figure the last time England . were here to formidable performer now complete, toyed with the opener . before having him caught by Lyon before the close. Only a second . innings century is likely to save the 33-year-old from the Test axe now. Ian Bell had been . promoted to No 3 for this match but the demise of Carberry led to the . emergence of Anderson in a continuation of England’s questionable policy . of using nightwatchmen in such circumstances. At . least Anderson and Cook survived to the close but with Johnson’s tail . up and this Sydney pitch still green England face yet another tough . battle if they are going to get towards parity here.

The FBI ran a child pornography service for two weeks last year, distributing images of children being raped and abused online to around 5,000 customers. A Seattle FBI agent has admitted the controversial technique in statements to court, and claimed it was used in an effort to catch out pedophiles signed up to the service. It is understood to be the first time the Bureau has actually dealt child porn as part of a sting, though agents have posed as child porn dealers in the past. Child protection advocates are likely to be outraged by the revelation, as federal prosecutors often claim that each time an image of rape or molestation is shared, the child is abused again. Controversial: The FBI ran a child pornography service for two weeks last year, distributing images of children being raped and abused online to around 5,000 customers . Known only as 'Website A,' the Nebraska-based child pornography service was described in an April 10 search warrant affidavit as an online bulletin board with the primary business of advertising and sharing child pornography. The affidavit was obtained by Seattlepi.com earlier this month but has since been sealed, the news website reported. The document described how agents in the Omaha area seized the site on November 16, 2012 and continued to operate it, while also monitoring graphic and disturbing messages among users, until December 2, 2012. At least 10,000 photos of children being raped, abused or forced to pose naked were broadcast through 'Website A,' according to Seattlepi.com. It had more than 5,600 registered users and 24,000 posts when it was finally shut down on December 2. The FBI told MailOnline it couldn't discuss the case or its decision to continue operating the website because the investigation was ongoing. 'This remains an ongoing investigation, and local court rules and Department of Justice policy prohibit me from providing more information at this time,' said FBI Omaha Division spokeman Sandy Breault. 'As in any given matter, if charges are filed, they will eventually become a matter of public record.' However, according to Seattlepi.com, court records suggest investigators resorted to running the ring after they were unable to trace customers through the service's records. While no charged have been laid in the case, information garnered from the investigation has reportedly led agents to one Western Washington home, which was searched on April 10. The study found access to porn can lead to young people engaging in ¿risky behaviours¿ such as unprotected anal sex and the use of drugs and alcohol during sex . The suspect is alleged to have accessed a 'jailbait' girls section of the website, specifically two men raping a pre-teen girl. He hasn't yet been charged and it's unclear what data was uncovered on computers seized from the property. The Seattle agent's statement reveals users often bragged about images of children being sexually assaulted by multiple men. 'There have been over 7,850 views of this thread in less than a week, which is a great compliment to the girls!' one user wrote, according to Seattlepi.com, which viewed the search warrant. 'However, I find it hard to believe than(sic) in the last century and a half since photography was invented, it hasn't occurred to more people that to photograph a cute little girl being hard (expletive) by two men is a fine and arousing thing to do.' In another thread, users chatted casually about their desire to rape children sown in a series of pornographic images. 'Jesus I would enjoy hurting that child,' a user said in the chat thread, the search warrant affidavit revealed. According to Seattlepi.com, court records fail to show how many images of raped and abused children were shared or accessed on the website while it was under FBI control. Investigators also do not state whether abused children whose pictures were accessed and swapped by pedophiles during the investigation were notified by the FBI.","A Seattle FBI agent has admitted the bureau busted a Nebraska-based child porn website in November, 2012, and operated it for two weeks before shutting it down .

In what it says would be the world's first, the U.S. Defense Department is planning to create a repository for brain tissue in an attempt to better understand traumatic brain injury amongst members of the armed services. The goal, Defense officials say, is to understand how head trauma leads to Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy, a neurodegenerative disorder that causes the progressive accumulation of a protein in nerve cells within certain regions of the brain. Collecting brains: the new brain repository aims to better understand traumatic brain injury amongst members of the armed services . In addition to servicemen and women, the effects of protein accumulation are often seen amongst boxers and football players, or anyone who's suffered multiple head trauma - and it often disturbs brain function. 'We have been at war for more than a decade and our men and women have . sacrificed,' Dr. Jonathan Woodson, assistant secretary of defense, says in a press release. 'The military health care system is bringing all the resources it can to . better understand how to prevent, diagnose and treat traumatic brain . injuries and to ensure that service members have productive and long, . quality lives.' According to Dr. Daniel Perl, a neuropathologist and director of the brain tissue repository, soldiers 'are coming home with troubling, persistent problems and we don't know . the nature of this, whether it's related to psychiatric responses from . engagement in warfare or related to actual damage to the brain...' Research: the CNRM is being funded by a federal grant to advance the understanding and treatment of TBI in service members . Before the government takes any brain tissue to add to the repository, it says it will get permission from the deceased service members' families. The repository, to be called the Center for Neuroscience and Regenerative Medicine Brain Tissue Repository for Traumatic Brain Injury, was established in Bethesda, Maryland, and is being funded by a federal grant to advance the understanding and treatment of TBI in service members. ""We are learning though the process of discovery the effects of . repetitive mild traumatic brain injury, and also how to prevent this . issue of chronic traumatic encephalopathy,"" Woodson said. ""The brain . tissue repository will enable us to learn even more about how we can . treat injuries and prevent future calamity for service members.""

Pit bulls have a reputation for being aggressive fighters, but one cat named Lurlene proved that with a little love, nurture can overcome nature. Lurlene took in an abandoned day-old pit bull puppy named Noland found by the Cleveland Animal Protective League last June. Abandoned by its mother and covered in flies in a garage, the newborn didn't have much chance of survival without somewhere to nurse and keep warm. Luckily, Lurlene took Noland under her paw and treated him no differently than her three kittens. Scroll down for video . Foster mom: Lurlene the cat took in Noland the pit bull last June when the day-old puppy was found abandoned by its mother . Cat-dog: Noland grew up alongside three of Lurlene's kittens and was treated just the same - even learning how to use the litter box . This touching story of inter-species adoption helped the nonprofit win a $25,000 grant from the Petco Foundation . The foundation received more than 4,500 applications, and the APL was one of the 33 winners announced Thursday. 'Truly, Noland and Lurlene's story encompasses everything we do at the APL - protecting animals from cruelty and neglect, staff members and volunteers working together to nurse them back to health, finding them wonderful new homes, and learning from them about the power of forgiveness and unconditional love and acceptance,' HAPL Director Sharon Harvey told the Cleveland Plain Dealer. Lurlene and Noland story first made headlines when the puppy was found last June. 'We were a little concerned that Noland would get to be too big and rough for his less robust feline family, but Lurlene had things under control and it didn't take the kittens long to learn how to put him in his place,' Harvey and APL director of development, Judy Hunter, wrote to Petco. 'Actually, Noland blended in with the family so well, he was even found using the litter box a few times.' Continuing the happy story: Lurlene and Noland's heartwarming story helped earn the Cleveland APL $25,000 in a Petco foundation grant . When Noland was finally big enough to be placed with a family, he had grown to 18 pounds . Since Noland was a little bigger than his kitten siblings, staff supplemented Lurlene's milk with bottle feeding. Growing up, he spent nine hours a day with his 'cat family' and then went home with a staff member in the evening, who bottle-fed him and monitored him overnight. When Noland got bigger, he was put in a foster home with a litter of puppies his own age and learned more about being a dog. Lurlene's nursing helped Noland grow strong and big and by the time he was adopted by a family - he had drown to 18 pounds.","The Cleveland Animal protective League helped keep puppy Noland alive last June by having him nurse off a cat mother named Lurlene .

At least 1,000 gagging orders have been signed by government departments and the NHS since the general election, costing taxpayers a ‘staggering’ £28million. An official report has uncovered at least 1,053 examples – one a day over the past three years – of the public sector paying off staff and buying their silence by getting them to sign confidentiality clauses. The highest payment of £266,000, which was described as ‘obscene’, was made by the Department of Health. The department accounted for more than a third of the ‘compromise agreements’ exposed by the National Audit Office. The highest payment of £266,000, which was described as 'obscene', was made by the Department of Health. The department accounted for more than a third of the 'compromise agreements' exposed by the National Audit Office . There are claims that the agreements have been used to prevent Health Service executives speaking out about poor care in hospitals. The spending watchdog found that across government there were 44 payments of £100,000 or more, and 110 of between £50,000 and £100,000. Three other departments, Education, Justice and the Home Office, bought people’s silence with more than £200,000. The highest average payment – more than £76,000 – was at the Department for International Development. No fewer than 98 per cent of the compromise agreements uncovered included confidentiality clauses, and even though the law is meant to protect whistleblowers, many recipients told the NAO they felt they had been gagged. The real number of compromise agreements will be far higher because not all are recorded by the Treasury. They do not include the millions handed out by councils and the BBC. The report by the NAO condemned the lack of ‘transparency, consistency and accountability’ around the agreements. The findings were condemned by Margaret Hodge, chairman of the powerful Commons public accounts committee. Three other departments, Education, Justice and the Home Office (above), bought people's silence with more than £200,000 . ‘It is staggering that no one has any idea how many compromise agreements are used and whether, overall, they are value for money,’ she said. ‘Pulling disparate bits  of information together reveals a worrying picture. ‘It is illegal for a compromise agreement to be used to stop people from whistleblowing. But this is not made clear enough and some people who have signed these agreements say they feel like they had been gagged. ‘It is simply unacceptable for people who speak up about failures in service delivery to feel like they have been silenced in this way. ‘There are individual cases where obscene amounts have been approved; as much as £266,000 in the Department of Health and £120,000 in the Ministry of Defence. ‘The centre of government must take control and assure itself that the use of these agreements is not squandering taxpayers’ money or covering up government failures. The current state of affairs cannot continue.’ The report found that the Treasury had approved £11.2million in severance payments by the Department of Health in the three years to March. One Ministry of Justice pay-off was £250,000, while the top figures at the Home Office and Department for Education were £225,000. The level of payments across most departments has been rising in recent years. The law states that compromise agreements are not allowed to prevent whistleblowing, and the NAO said that none did. But the report said: ‘Some people we spoke to who had been offered, or accepted, compromise agreements have felt gagged. ‘An organisation’s culture, the events leading up to the person being offered an agreement, and the wording of the agreements contributed to whether the individual felt gagged. ‘Legal advice to the employee is a prerequisite of making a compromise agreement legally enforceable. However, the individuals we spoke to felt that it was not generally made clear that confidentiality clauses do not prevent employees from raising legitimate public interest concerns.’ The NAO also criticised the way the pay-offs were often used to get rid of poorly performing members of staff. These workers were given good references, meaning they could get jobs elsewhere in the public sector.","Highest payment, made by Department of Health, described as 'obscene'

North Korea has carried out a drill using live artillery near its disputed border with the South, according to official media. The exercise was personally supervised by leader Kim Jong Un, who has issued a series of inflammatory threats against South Korea and the U.S. in recent days. The drill is the latest sign of worryingly high tensions between the neighbours after North Korea cancelled the ceasefire signed at the end of the Korean War. Scroll down for video . Warlike: North Korean members of the Worker-Peasant Red Guards shouting anti-U.S. slogans . Supervising: North Korea's latest drill was overseen by dictator Kim Jong Un, pictured with his generals . Rhetoric: Kim has issued a series of chilling threats since the imposition of fresh UN sanctions . The border where the exercise took place is seen as the most likely site of any clash between the North and the South. North Korea has threatened a nuclear war with the U.S. after being enraged by new UN sanctions and military drills being held by South Korean and American troops. Kim praised the artillery units on two islands after watching them hit targets in what state news agency KCNA described as the 'biggest hotspots in the southwestern sector of the front'. Over the past few days he has been reported telling troops to 'cut the enemies' windpipes' and threatening 'all-out war'. Drill: North Korea has apparently used live shells in its latest military exercise near the border with the South . Assault: There are worries the drill could be the prelude to a fresh assault on South Korea or the West . Reaction: The drills are partly a response to military exercises being held by the U.S. and South Korea . North Korea's claims to be able to stage a nuclear strike on the United States have been derided by most observers of its missile programme, but it in 2010 its troops killed South Korean civilians while shelling an island. Pyongyang has kept up a steady stream of incendiary rhetoric since its third nuclear test prompted a push for fresh sanctions at the UN. It was also subject to sanctions for the launch of a long-range test rocket in December that critics say is aimed at proving its technological capability. Attack! The North Korean army has repudiated the ceasefire it signed with the South after the Korean War . Inspection: Kim has tried to project a more warlike image in recent days during military duties . Danger? It is still unclear whether or not North Korea intends to follow through on its threats . The new UN sanctions aim to stifle funding for the North's nuclear and missile programmes and for the ruling Kim dynasty, although much will depend on whether China, the North's main ally, actually enforces them. So far, it is unclear whether Pyongyang genuinely intends to attack its enemies or whether it is just a rhetorical ploy.

Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt will bring back the practice of writing the names of the responsible doctor and nurse above every bed so families know 'where the buck stops' Eight patients die needlessly every day because of a ‘silent scandal’ of NHS errors, the Health Secretary said today. Jeremy Hunt will bring back the practice of writing the names of the responsible doctor and nurse above every bed so families know ‘where the buck stops’. The NHS should also publish better safety information, such as the likelihood of emerging unscathed from each hospital across the country, he said. In a speech at University College . Hospital, London, arranged before the scandal of watchdogs hiding baby . deaths broke, Mr Hunt said nearly 500,000 patients were harmed . unnecessarily and 3,000 died last year. In 2011/12, there were 326 so-called ‘never events’ – events so unacceptable they should never happen. ‘The . ones we know about include 161 people with foreign objects left in . their bodies, like swabs or surgical tools; 70  people suffering . wrong-site surgery, where the wrong part of the body or even the wrong . patient was operated on; and 41 people given incorrect implants or . prostheses,’ Mr Hunt said. ‘Put another way – every other day we . leave a foreign object in someone’s body, every week we operate on the . wrong part of someone’s body, and every fortnight we insert the wrong . implant. This is the silent scandal of our NHS.’ The NHS sees nearly three million . people a week. About 0.4 per cent suffer harm and 0.003 per cent die – . better rates than France, Germany, Sweden, Norway and the US. But . pointing to scandals in Mid Staffs and Morecambe Bay, Mr Hunt said a . ‘grim fatalism’ blunts ‘the anger we should feel about every single . individual we let down’. ‘We have allowed ourselves to settle for levels of patient harm that are simply unacceptable.’ Mr Hunt today visited University College Hospital HQ and Education Centre, London where Clinton John demonstrated a robotic da Vinci Surgical System .

It will become the first healthcare system to publish information on the likelihood of a ‘harm-free’ experience across every hospital in the country. The Health Secretary added: ‘The NHS fails too many times. But it also holds the keys to becoming the world’s safest health system.’ Professor Norman Williams, president of the Royal College of Surgeons, said: ‘Any preventable harm is unacceptable. However rare these incidents are, never should mean never.’ Sir Richard Thompson, president of the Royal College of Physicians, added: ‘Every patient should have a named consultant responsible for their care.

Prison guards stood by and filmed a teenage inmate as she gasped for breath while she slowly choked to death in her cell. Ashley Smith, died in 2007 at Kitchener’s Grand Valley Institution for Women in south Ontario. For the first time, the full video depicting the asphyxiation of the troubled teenager was played to a jury this week at the coroner’s inquest. The video shows the guards watching the 19-year-old through a hatch door in her cell. At the time the video begins, recorded at 6:45 a.m., guards had been debating for about 10 minutes what to do about Smith, according to CBC News. Smith was institutionalized for much of her adolescence in the youth system in her native New Brunswick before being transferred to the federal adult system. Vessels in Ashley’s face and eyes had . burst and her face had gone mottled from previous times she had tried to . asphyxiate herself. Guards had been told she was seeking attention, and were instructed not to intervene unless she stopped breathing. WARNING GRAPHIC CONTENT: Scroll down for video . Troubling: Ashley Smith taking her last breaths as she lies on the floor of her prison cell while guards watch . Tragic: Smith seen left communicating with guards at the window before her death and right after guards rush in to try and save her . But in the video guards had watched Smith on the floor – wedged between a steel bed and the wall – as she occasionally heaved, her dying gasps picked up on the video. She is seen wearing a quilted jacket which is given to patients who self-harm or as a restrain jacket. She has her head pressed against the wall and is motionless, reported the Globe and Mail. 'It’s been long enough for me to take that off,' a guard calls through the door. 'Sit up so you can come over here and I can cut it off.' 'Ashley. Can you get it off yourself?' Captured: The camera was then being operated by Valentino (Rudy) Burnett, a correctional officer. He is pictured here watching the video at the inquest . As her faces turns a deep purple and she is motionless, the guards enter the cell and try to rouse her by slapping . her on the back, without any response. The guards begin to perform CPR, though one of them is heard swearing that she has not had any CPR training in 11 years. The camera was being operated by Valentino (Rudy) Burnett, a . correctional officer who was temporarily working at Kitchener’s Grand . Valley Institution for Women. Mr Burnett and three other prison employees were originally charged for their role in Smith’s death, but the charges were dropped. 'Will . you agree with me, Mr. Burnett, that you in essence videoed somebody’s . death?' asked Julian Falconer, the Smith family lawyer. But Mr . Burnett replied: 'While I was videotaping her, I saw her chest rising . on a number of occasions. I saw her breathing on a number of occasions. As far as I was concerned, I was videotaping a live person.' Imprisoned: Smith was admitted directly to the segregation unit at Kitchener's Grand Valley Institution  on August 31, 2007 . He said it was not his job to save her life - he was 'just concerned with doing what I was asked to do.' Howard Rubel, lawyer for the correctional officers union, defended the guards, who struggled and debated how to deal with Smith, reported CBC News. 'They were following what they were told was in the best interests of Miss Smith and they were trying to help her as much as possible to prevent the tragedy, but unfortunately, they weren’t allowed to prevent that tragedy as they saw fit,' he said. Smith was admitted directly to the segregation unit on August 31, 2007. With the exception of a few hospital visits, she remained in isolation until she choked to death on October 19. Blaine Phibbs, a correctional officer, testified he first saw Ashley Smith try and choke herself within 12 hours of her arrival. Smith was first arrested at age 13 for assault and causing a disturbance, and was jailed at 15 after throwing crab apples at a postman. Her time in the federal prison system was marked by repeated incidents of self-harm. The presiding coroner has also said the inquest should examine the way the prison system treats the mentally ill. Outside court, Canada Press reported the Smith family lawyer Julian Falconer said he had little sympathy for the guards who failed to save the teen's life. 'Human beings are human beings; good people do bad things,' Mr Falconer said. 'On that day, a group of guards did bad things.","Ashley Smith, died in 2007 at Kitchener’s Grand Valley Institution for Women .

Paedophile rock star Ian Watkins will earn more than £150,000 while serving a 29-year jail sentence for child sex offences. The singer's conviction forced his former band, the Lostprophets, to break up - and distribute their assets worth more than £700,000, it has been revealed. Watkins, who is currently jailed in top-security Wakefield prison, is contracted to take £147,497 in the deal. And music experts claim the convicted molesterer will earn more than £100,000 in royalties during his sentence. The 36-year-old, from Pontypridd, pleaded guilty to three counts of child sexual assault at a trial in Cardiff Crown Court last month. But today it emerged Goonies Touring Company, which handles Lostprophets' finances, will distribute the earnings, as instructed by the other four members. A source told the Daily Star Sunday: 'Watkins is entitled to the money because it is cash earned by the band before this scandal. 'It is not money earned from criminal enterprises so it can't be confiscated by the state.'

It's a bona fide industry that is, officially, only five days old - but represents hundreds of millions of dollars. As Colorado comes close to closing out the first week of its 'green rush', with recreational marijuana stores legally allowed to sell the drug from January 1 under revolutionary new state laws, official sales figures and profit margins have started rolling in. 'Adult use' pot is projected to be a $208 million industry in Colorado this year - on top of the $250 million projected to be spent on medical marijuana, Betty Aldworth, deputy director of the National Cannabis Industry Association, told CNN. One business alone, the Lodo Wellness Center in Denver, which is described as a 'boutique' marijuana store that is cash-only, recorded $10,000 in sales in the first few hours of Wednesday. Don Andrews (center) - owner of the LoDo Wellness Center in Denver, which recorded $10,000 cash in the first few hours of sales on Jan. 1 -   talks with out-of-town customers out front of his store . Customers wait in line to enter LoDo Wellness, which by noon had given out more than 600 entrance tickets on the first day of retail sales of marijuana in Colorado on Wednesday, January 1, 2014 . While the owners, married couple Donald and Linda Andrews - who started the store in 2000 as a medical marijuana dispensary, foreseeing the substance one day becoming legal -  told CNN they made more in one day than they would normally in one month. Although not divulging the figure, the pair said they served about 1,000 customers, with the majority buying an eighth of an ounce, priced between $40 and $50. The estimated total sits around $50,000 for day one. In all, about $1 million in business was done at about 35 pot shops on the first day of marijuana's legalization in Colorado, Aldworth estimated, giving each an average first day earning of $28,000. While that business is unlikely to continue, with people flying in from all over the country, as well as Canada and Australia, to be among the historic first to buy legal weed, pot shop owners are looking to increase their number of plants several-fold. All business must grow their own marijuana, under the laws. All plants are grown indoors, and the law limits to six the number of plants grown under each light fixture.

Evergreen Apothecary in Denver served 400 customers on opening day and now plans to increase its plants from 2,000 to as many as 24,000. 'This is unquestionably a tremendous growth industry,' Aldworth said. 'There hasn't been an opportunity like this in American history in quite some time. 'The tech boom had an impact on the American economy, but I think this could rival it. 'We're not creating a market out of nothing. 'We are just shifting it from the underground market.'

Killer: Convicted murderer Askari Abdullah Muhammad is to be executed on Tuesday at Florida State Prison . A man convicted of abducting and killing a Miami couple and later stabbing a prison guard to death is set to be executed after nearly four decades on Florida's death row. Askari Abdullah Muhammad, previously known as Thomas Knight, is scheduled to die by lethal injection Tuesday at Florida State Prison in Starke barring a last-minute, successful appeal. Governor Rick Scott signed the death warrant after the Florida Supreme Court in December rejected Muhammad's challenge to chemicals used in the state's execution procedure. The 62-year-old Muhammad was first condemned to die for the 1974 abduction and killings of Sydney and Lillian Gans of Miami. He was sentenced to die again for killing Correction Officer Richard Burke in 1980 using a sharpened spoon. Only . two prisoners have been on Florida’s Death Row longer than Muhammad. His . murder of the Ganses, while unfamiliar to newer generations of South . Floridians, was a major story in July 1974, according to the Miami . Herald. Sydney Gans, 64, owned a successful paper bag company and a minor league baseball team, the Miami Beach Flamingos. Gans . also employed parolees looking for a second chance. Muhammad was one of . them. He had worked for the paper company for 10 days when he kidnapped . Sydney Gans at rifle point. Caught: Muhammad's mughsot the day he was arrested for the murder of Sydney and Lillian Gans, which was a major story in Florida in July 1974 . Murdered: In October 1980, Muhammad thrust a sharpened spoon into the chest of corrections officer Richard Burke, 48, because the prison would not let him see his mother . Muhammad forced him to drive to the Gans’ home, where he kidnapped Lillian Gans. The three drove to downtown Miami, where he forced Sydney Gans to . enter a bank and withdraw $50,000. Muhammad - armed with a semi-automatic .30-caliber carbine - held Lillian Gans in the back of the businessman’s car. Inside, Gans alerted the bank manager, who called authorities, according to the Herald. Gans, fearing for his wife’s safety, returned to the car. A slew of agents and cops covertly tailed the car as Muhammad ordered Gans to drive to West Miami-Dade. In a blunder that still riles the Gans relatives today, agents lost track of the car. In a secluded wooded area at Southwest 132nd Street and 117th Avenue, Muhammad shot each of the Gans with a bullet to the neck. He disappeared as heavily armed officers swarmed the woods, according to the Herald. For hours, authorities scoured the woods. Teargas was deployed. A deputy found Muhammad buried in the mud, the money and the rifle underneath his body. In October 1980, Muhammad thrust a sharpened spoon into the chest of corrections officer Burke, 48, because the prison would not let Knight see his mother, who was making her first visit.","Askari Abdullah Muhammad, 62, previously known as Thomas Knight, is set to die by lethal injection Tuesday at Florida State Prison .

Bill de Blasio opened the doors of New York City's Gracie Mansion to thousands of public ticket holders on Sunday in an unprecedented housewarming for the new mayor and his family. De Blasio will be only the tenth mayor to live in the historic Upper East Side Federal-style home, which the Bloomberg administration raised millions to renovate for public viewing. 'I'm thrilled to welcome New Yorkers from across the City into the People’s House,' de Blasio said of the tour using the nickname given the home by Bloomberg, who's be very critical of his successor's decision to move into it. View from the inside: New NYC mayor Bill de Blasio threw open the doors of Gracie Mansion on Sunday for thousands of visitors to help welcome him to his new official home as mayor . He and his family welcomed thousands of curious visitors into their 200-year-old new home Sunday morning at the conclusion of a week during which the entire city of 8 million residents welcomed de Blasio as their new mayor. 'It’s been a pleasure sharing the inauguration with residents from all five boroughs, and I can’t think of a better way to end the week than by spending it with New Yorkers,' de Blasio said in a release. Bill de Blasio took the oath of office on Wednesday, formally becoming the 109th mayor of New York City while pledging to pursue a sweeping liberal agenda. 'Big dreams are not a luxury reserved for a privileged few but the animating force behind every community, in every borough,' he said in his speech. First family: De Blasio says he and his family came to a group decision to live in the historic home and they'll become just the 10th mayoral family to call Gracie Mansion home . Criticism: The over 200-year-old Federal style mansion was built in 1799. Former Mayor Bloomberg has never lived there has criticized preemptively criticized any future mayor's decision to do so . That vision included an unusually open inauguration ceremony. De Blasio welcomed the public to his swearing in, an occasion usually reserved for VIPs and city insiders. While residents thrilled to get a peak inside the mansion at such a newsworthy moment are no doubt supportive of de Blasio's event, Michael Bloomberg is likely tisk-tisking the media savvy move. Bloomberg never lived in the mansion and has for years criticized pre-emptively any future mayor who decides to live in the 1799 home overlooking the East River. Luxurious: The home has played host to events for some of the world's most beloved dignitaries including the late Nelson Mandela . The mayor's bedroom: Sunday's visitor's likely got a peak at this, the master bedroom in Gracie Mansion . 'Family decision': After debating whether to move to the Manhattan mansion or stay in their beloved Brooklyn neighborhood, the de Blasios decided to live in the decadent digs. No one has lived in Gracie Mansion since Rudolph Giuliani left office in 2001 . 'A lot of people want to be mayor — you don’t have to give them extra money as a housing allowance,' the billionaire said in 2012. Bloomberg is rumored to have raised some $7 million for a renovation of the historic home, which is steeped in New York City and American history far more than it is precendent for mayoral occupancy. Even the first mayor to move into the home, Fiorello H. LaGuardia in 1942, is remembered as having done so begrudgingly. But the de Blasios, who previously . hailed from the liberal Brooklyn enclave of Park Slope, say living in . their private home now poses security issues. De Blasio announced his move in a letter titled Family Decision that he was posted to his website in December. In it, the mayor made clear the move is only a temporary, physical one. 'This . is our home.' he said, referring to his Brooklyn residence. 'This is . our life. This is our neighborhood, and we’re Brooklynites. We’re . obviously Brooklynites, and we’ll always be Brooklynites.' Gracie Mansion is located on a site that was purchased in 1646 by Dutch farmer Sybout Claessen, who called his land Horn's Hook after his hometown of Hoorn, Holland. More than a century later, merchant Jacob Wealton built a house on the farmland, which was commandeered by George Washington's troops during the American Revolution because of its strategic location - directly across the loyalist stronghold of Queens . In 1799, a prosperous New York merchant named Archibald Gracie built a country house overlooking a bend in the East River, 5 miles north of the City. Financial failure forced Gracie to sell his house to Joseph Foulke in 1823, and in 1857, the house came into the possession of Noah Wheaton. The City of New York appropriated the estate in 1896, incorporating its 11 acres of grounds into the newly-formed Carl Schurz Park. Painter holds a roll of wall paper which will be hung in reception room of Gracie Mansion, being redecorated in this 1946 photo for occupancy by the mayor William O'Dwyer, who was succeeding Mayor Fiorello LaGuardia who was the mansion's first mayoral occupant, and his family . After decades of use as a concession stand and restrooms for the park, Gracie Mansion was restored and became the first home of the Museum of the City of New York. Soon after the museum moved to a larger space on Fifth Avenue, Parks Commissioner Robert Moses convinced City authorities to designate Gracie Mansion as the official residence of the Mayor, and in 1942, Fiorello La Guardia moved in. Gracie Mansion was enlarged in 1966 with the addition of the Susan E. Wagner Wing, which includes a grand ballroom and two intimate reception rooms. In 2002, the interior and exterior were again restored, and the house was transformed into the ‘People's House’ with increased accessibility to the public and to City agencies. Here, New York City mayor Robert F. Wagner during a 1955 press conference at Gracie Mansion. It was Wagner's wife Susan who ordered an addition to the home in the 1960s, which was named for her after she died during its construction .

At least 15 workers have been killed after a building collapsed and was reduced to a pile of broken rubble, at a development in Goa, on Saturday. Rescuers spent Sunday using backhoes and shovels to search for survivors amid the concrete and dust left behind following the collapse of the residential building, which is under construction in Canacona, about 44 miles from the state capital of Panaji. Authorities suspect dozens more may be trapped under the rubble, but are yet to determine how many workers were on site when the five-story structure crumpled on Saturday afternoon. Scroll down for video . Tragedy: At least 15 workers were killed after a building collapsed in Canacona, Goa . Search continues: At least 15 have been killed and more are feared dead following the building's collapse . The team carry a victim's body after discovering it among the vast pile of concrete rubble . Witnesses said the Ruby Residency, being built by Bharat Realtors and Developers, crashed like a 'pack of cards' at around 3pm and reported seeing at least 40 workers. Soldiers and fire-fighters listened for movement or cries from the wreckage as they worked overnight to clear the debris, said state official Venancio Furtado. At least ten people were pulled out alive overnight, but the chance of finding survivors was dwindling, Furtado added. By Sunday afternoon, the death toll had reached 15, according to the state government. Goa Chief Minister Manohar Parrikar said he ordered a review of the construction project, after seeing cracks that developed in the adjacent apartment building, which was also constructed by the same Mumbai-based company. 'The design is faulty, which is why the tragedy happened,' said Parrikar. Search: A rescue worker stands with a stretcher near the debris from the five-storey building .

Police are investigating both the building company and city officials who approved the construction on a patch of marshland in Panaji. But they have so far been unable to track down the construction manager and building contractor. 'Without the contractor, it is impossible for us to know how many labourers were on the shift,' said state official Ajit Panchwadkar, who supervised today's rescue effort.

Many of the workers had come from other, poorer states, including Jharkhand, Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, in search of jobs in India's thriving construction business. One worker who was not at the scene when the building collapsed said he earned about 300 rupees (Â£3) for a day's work, according to Press Trust of India.

A woman who posted a shocking video online of her botched butt implants flipping inside out has spoken out about the horror surgery for the first time. 'I was showing my girlfriend how I could reach up under my implant and it just kind of flipped and freaked me out,' victim Renee explained to talk show host Trisha Goddard, describing the moment she discovered her quest for a perfect butt had gone terribly wrong. Renee, who declined to give her last name, uploaded the 20-second clip, showing the implants protruding grotesquely, on YouTube late last year in an effort to warn others of the dangers of cut-price cosmetic surgery, and the video has been viewed more than a million times. 'I started getting really sick. I couldn't breath,' Renee added. The woman brought the over-sized implants onto the talk show, which caused the audience to gasp in horror. She said she remained in a lot of pain after having them removed. Renee is now urging women to ensure their cosmetic surgeon is the real deal before signing up for surgery, or better still avoid it all together. 'Love the skin you're in,' Renee said. 'Please don't go and do this stuff to yourself. If more people would come out and tell their stories then less women would go and do this.' The distressing video that was posted online on November 27 shows two grotesque lumps bulging from Renee's buttocks, caused when her botched silicone implant 'flipped inside out'.

Life-threatening: Renee told Trisha, right, that the surgery almost cost her her life . The video was initially suspected to be a fake because Renee posted no details about which clinic she went to or exactly what type of procedure she had. But BAAPS Member Adrian Richards, a consultant plastic surgeon at Aurora Clinics in the UK, said back in December that the clip was authentic. He said the 'flipping' problem occurs . when the implant is not secured firmly enough in a pocket the surgeon . creates either between the buttock and the pelvic bone or on top of the . gluteus maximus. 'It is . a complication which is relatively common following buttock implants. It shouldn't really happen because the pocket should be snug so the . implant stays where it is. Botched buttock: In the clip, the unidentified woman slowly manipulates it back into place while explaining: 'This is my implant flipping backwards' Miffed: The woman adds: 'I don't think an implant's supposed to do that. It shouldn't be able to flip' 'This lady's implant is flat on the bottom and coned on the top, but this one has flipped over.' He said it wouldn't be painful, but would likely need to be removed or the pocket closed up to stop it shifting around. Buttock implants are popular in South America, where plump bottoms are regarded as sexually desirable. In recent years, plastic surgery . experts have been warning women not to have operations in unapproved . clinics after a string of deaths and dodgy practices. Back in place: The video has been 'liked' by 278 people on Facebook and shared nearly 20,000 times . How it should look: The implant returns to its 'default position' but may not stay there for long . To insert the implant, an incision is usually made where the cheek meets the back of the thigh or in the buttock crease where the scars are less noticeable. The surgeon then creates a pocket large enough to insert the silicone either under the gluteus maximus muscle or on top of it. Sometimes fat is taken by liposuction from another area of the body to enhance the shape of the buttocks. The surgeon will then make sure both buttocks are symmetrical before stitching up the wounds. But if the pocket is made too big, the implant can slip out. The procedure is normally performed under general anaesthetic. An alternative method involves injecting fat into the buttocks. In April last year, a 42-year-old mother-of-three died after buttock implant surgery at a backstreet Las Vegas clinic. Elena Caro's family begged her not to . have the operation, saying she was beautiful as she was, but she went . ahead with the surgery. She was found crying in agony and begging for help after an unlicensed Colombian doctor allegedly dumped her by the side of the road when the procedure went wrong and she died in hospital a short time later. In December 2009, a former Miss Argentina who was obsessed with maintaining her youthful looks died following surgery to make her buttocks firmer. Solange Magnano, 38, was rushed to hospital with severe breathing problems after the cosmetic operation. The mother of eight-year-old twins died from a blocked lung artery after spending three days in a critical condition in intensive care. Atlanta woman Kimberly Smedley was jailed for three years in July after injecting customers' buttocks with commercial silicone in hotel rooms and using glue and cotton balls to prevent the substance from leaking out. Federal prosecutors believe Smedley made at least $1.3 million while operating her illegal practice out of hotel rooms in Baltimore, Washington, Detroit, Philadelphia and New York. In cases where silicone jabs are used, the procedure can cause a blood clot to the lungs known as a pulmonary embolism.","Renee, who declined to give her last name, said the horrific surgery almost cost her her life .

Maverick: When Maryland Congressman Roscoe Bartlett was voted out of office last year, he retired to his remote West Virginia compound sitting on 153 acres of land to live out his days off the grid. Former Congressman Roscoe Bartlett has swapped his suit and tie for a pair of denim overalls and retreated into the dense woods of West Virginia, where he has been living off the grid in preparation for natural or man-made doomsday. Bartlett, a small-government, Tea Party-style Republican, had spent two decades as the U.S. representative for Maryland's 6th congressional district. In 2013, he was voted out of office and replaced with Democrat John Delaney thanks to the process of gerrymandering. Over the course of his career in public service, Bartlett used his status as a U.S. congressman to sound the alarm about the vulnerability of the American power grid, Politico Magazine reported in a lengthy profile. Speaking on the House floor, Bartlett prophesied that if the U.S. failed to act, an attack on the electrical system would plunge the nation into darkness and chaos: imagine the New York City blackout of 2004 stretched over six months or longer. Bartlett's warnings of catastrophic electromagnetic pulse attacks and solar flares fell on deaf ears and earned him a reputation as a crank. But when the 87-year-old politician left office last year, he decided to practice what he preached by going off the grid. Eccentric: Bartlett, pictured here with then-Prescient George W. Bush in 2006, had spent years sounding the alarm about EMPs - electromagnetic pulses that could knock out America's power grid . Bartlett and his wife, Ellen, retired to their remote West Virginia retreat to live out their days almost entirely independent of the system. The lakeside compound made up of five solar-powered cabins - with a sixth under construction - is nestled in a wooded area on a 4,000-foot elevation four hours from Washington DC. Bartlett bought the 153-acre property back in 1980 for $80,000 and has spent the past three decades improving the amenities built to house his 10 adult children and their families in case of a doomsday scenario. The bucolic property boasts a manmade lake with a pair of swans, saw and flour mill, and several vegetable gardens. In the fall, Bartlett was still in the process of building another cabin, which will feature a large kitchen, composting toilets, a root cellar - and even Internet access via satellite. Every couple of weeks, the survivalist octogenarian shaves off his white beard, dons a suit and heads to the capital, where he serves as a senior consultant for a cybersecurity company called Lineage Technologies. Crank: Even among fellow Republicans like conservative Florida Congressman Allen West (left), Bartlett got a reputation for being somewhat odd . Back home in West Virginia, Bartlett spends up to 12 hours tending to his vast property: cutting logs, gardening and making needed repairs. Despite his advanced age, Bartlett, a vegetarian, is reportedly in excellent health only slightly marred by arthritis and acid reflux. But his old-age ailments do not stop from rising before dawn six days a week. The son of a farmer, Bartlett said he learned everything he needed to build his rustic refuge while growing up in western Pennsylvania during the Great Depression. He completed his early education in a one-room schoolhouse and went on to earn his bachelor's degree in theology and biology from Columbia Union College (now Washington Adventist University) in Maryland. Bartlett continued his studies, earning a master's degree and PhD in physiology, and embarking on a career as a college professor. The young scientist later switched gears, working for IBM and serving as a U.S. Navy engineer before becoming director of the Space Life Sciences research group at Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory, where he helped the U.S. defeat the Soviets in the space race. When he was elected to Congress in 1980, Bartlett stood out among Republicans and got a reputation for being quirky and eccentric: he espoused libertarian values long before the emergence of the Tea Party and advocated for going green years before it was cool. Tea Party libertarian: Bartlett, pictured next to Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi in 2011, pushed for budget cuts and voted against minimum wage increase . As a staunch opponent of big government, Bartlett voted against minimum wage increases and against extending financial help to the cash-strapped Postal Service. With virtually no support from his party, Bartlett pushed Congress to allocate billions of dollars to harden America's power grid so it could withstand an electromagnetic pulse (EMP) attack by an enemy armed with a warhead capable of wreaking havoc on the nation’s infrastructure. But to Bartlett’s chagrin, his colleagues on the Hill ignored his warnings, instead choosing to focus on more pressing matters. ‘If an event is going to end life as you know it, how can you say it’s too expensive?’ he told the magazine. ‘It is an absolute certainty it’ll happen.’","Roscoe Bartlett, 87, left office last year after serving as representative of Maryland's 6th congressional district for 20 years .
