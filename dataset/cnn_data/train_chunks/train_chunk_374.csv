"The mugshot shows a fairly clean-cut man with short hair, his head cocked, sporting a half-smile. That was Charles Mozdir in 2012, when he stood accused of molesting a then 5-year-old boy in California. But authorities didn't see much of Mozdir after that picture, after he failed to show up for his arraignment. ""Our case went cold in 2012,"" conceded Supervisory Deputy U.S. Marshal Steve Jurman. ""He was definitely living on cash, with a good fake ID. He was off our grid."" Mozdir reappeared on their radar thanks to a Florida woman who watched CNN's ""The Hunt"" with John Walsh, which first aired July 20. She recognized Mozdir when the show's segment about him aired, she recalled his dog and she ultimately gave authorities his cell phone number, according to a senior law enforcement official. Tip during CNN's 'The Hunt' led police to suspect . Her tip and some investigative work led police to Smoking Culture, a smoke shop in New York's West Village. Working there was a man who some knew as ""Big John."" He sported a bushy beard and ponytail. He may not have looked much like the man from that 2012 mugshot. But the New York police detective who went into the smoke shop recognized him nonetheless. The detective came back soon with help, only to be greeted by shots from Mozdir. This time, the suspect didn't escape. He was killed in the exchange of fire. Fled after being arrested for child assault . So who was Charles Mozdir? Where did he go and what did he do, after that 2012 accusation? To tell his story, you have to start two years ago, in Coronado, California. That's where two close friends asked Mozdir to help care for their young son, who was home ill with a high fever. The parents say the boy said Mozdir touched his private parts. The parents went to police, after which investigators searched Mozdir's house and found evidence of child pornography and bestiality on his cell phone and computers, according to U.S. Marshals Service Deputy Brian Grimes. Four days later, they arrested Mozdir. A district attorney told the Coronado boy's parents Mozdir also was accused of child assault while babysitting another boy. Mozdir posted bail. But rather than show up in court to face the accusation, he ran. Grimes said investigators think Mozdir took all his money with him, indicating in a phone call he might go to Mexico or Japan. His roommate told police Mozdir had two guns and had threatened to kill himself and kill a victim's father. This all made the Coronado boy's parents' nightmare worse, according to Walsh, who made tracking down fugitives his life's mission after the 1981 abduction and killing of his 6-year-old son, Adam. 5 things to know about fugitive hunter John Walsh . ""This family was destroyed, terrified that he would come back and hurt them, because they had the courage to come forward and file charges against him,"" said Walsh, co-founder of the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. From California to Florida to New York . Authorities searched in California, they looked in the Mexican state of Baja California. But the first indication that Mozdir went east came June 20, 2012 -- five days after his scheduled arraignment -- when his abandoned vehicle was found hidden in brush outside the coastal Georgia town of Darien. Its license plate was ripped off, an extra gas tank was inside. A bloodhound picked up Mozdir's scent near U.S. 17, which runs through Darien. Yet there was no sign of the man himself. As Jurman from the U.S. Marshals Service conceded, authorities didn't have much clue what happened. Now, they have a better idea. According to Jurman, ""(Mozdir) had a history of working in smoke shops. He had a hobby of blowing glass, which would come in handy at a smoke shop."" To some, he seemed friendly enough. On Yelp, one customer of the West Village shop described him as ""super helpful."" Another wrote: ""John is the dude! He was pretty chilled and very helpful."" And while his appearance and identify changed, one thing did not: Mozdir had a dog. The last time he'd been spotted -- up until this week -- he'd had his black Labrador, by the name of Lucky, with him. That's one reason authorities gave credence to the call of the Florida woman, because she mentioned the dog. ""I know Mozdir,"" the caller said, according to Jurman. ""He left here 10 months ago."" It's not known if Mozdir went directly from Florida to New York, or if he stopped somewhere in between. But that's where his story ended -- with a fight. In the smoke shop, Mozdir had a .32-caliber handgun and over 20 rounds of ammunition. As police Commissioner Bill Bratton explained, ""Mozdir fired upon the officers at very close range, and the officers returned fire... ""During the exchange of gunfire, the detective and two marshals were wounded. Charles Mozdir was shot dead.""","Charles Mozdir was accused of molesting a 5-year-old California boy .

"Women who give up careers to stay at home and raise their children should be paid a salary, according to one of South Africa's most influential businesswomen. Wendy Luhabe, who in 1999 was recognized as one of the 50 leading women entrepreneurs of the world by the U.S.-based Star Group, says that stay-at-home moms should be given 10% of their husbands' earnings. ""A mommy salary, as a way of giving value to the work of bringing up children, so that it's not a resentful choice that women have to make,"" explains Luhabe. As well as a successful career in South Africa's corporate boardrooms, Luhabe also has a long history of promoting gender equality --  in 1993, she founded the Women Investment Portfolio Holdings, an initiative that enabled poor women to participate and invest in some of the country's biggest companies. Luhabe, who in 2006 was also inaugurated as Chancellor of the University of Johannesburg, spoke to CNN's Robyn Curnow, sharing some of her thoughts on women in the workplace. Below is an edited version of the interview. CNN: What's a thought leader? Wendy Luhabe: Someone who changes the rules of the game, who challenges the status quo. An example of that would be a wild thought that I've been entertaining for a while, that mothers who choose to be at home should be paid a salary: 10% of their husbands' earnings should be attributed or contributed towards the mothers. CNN: A mommy salary? WL: A mommy salary, as a way of giving value to the work of bringing up children, so that it's not a resentful choice that women have to make. CNN: Do you think the work of women at home is undervalued? WL: That is the underlying principle, that it is undervalued and because it's undervalued it becomes, for some women, I think, a resentful choice. And money is the currency that we use to define value of a contribution to the world, so why shouldn't we do the same for the work of bringing up children, which I think is probably the most important contribution that the world should be valuing. CNN: So on the flip side, what's your assessment of a growing number of women who choose to work as well as having kids? Do you feel that women are stretching themselves too thin, particularly working mothers? WL: I don't think they are, I just think that we need to create an environment that allows women to make the choices that they want to make. If women choose to have children, they must be able to have the support structure that they require to do that joyfully, so that we can bring up children who are healthy, because the opposite side of that is we have children who are growing up without parents. CNN: Raised by nannies. WL: Who are raised by nannies and that creates its own problems in society, so if I had to choose I would choose a society where women make the choice to be at home to bring up their children, because they know that contribution will be valued and secondly when they go back to work they won't be penalized for having taken some time off to go and bring up children. So it's really an idea that needs to be embraced by society, not so much for the benefit of women, but because we recognize that creating a society where children are properly brought up, preferably by their mothers, would create a much healthier society, a more stable society. CNN: A lot of people would maybe agree with you depending where they are and who they are and a lot of people will just write off this idea as utterly absurd. WL: But the world was never changed by people who have normal ideas, the world is always changed by people who have absurd ideas. CNN: All these years after the end of apartheid, have conditions improved for the South African women as much as you would like? WL: Let me respond to that from a different perspective, we are living through what I call a revolution -- and some catastrophes -- as we sit here. The revolution is driven by technology which is changing the way that we communicate, which is exposing the hardships of the people at the bottom of the pyramid and which is giving the marginalized a voice. As we've seen with the unexpected regime changes in Tunisia, in Egypt, the elections in Sudan, more recently the riots in London, when you look at that, it tells me that the marginalized are no longer prepared to give permission to those in power to determine their future or to dictate the circumstances of their existence. And that, for me, is an invitation for women to offer our experience, to offer our wisdom, to offer our leadership in a world that is riddled with moral bankruptcy. It is becoming quite pervasive in all aspects of our lives, with a leadership vacuum that is growing larger by the day and all of these things, both the revolution of technology and these catastrophes are an opportunity for women to step forward and provide leadership in a world that is desperate for some direction.","Wendy Luhabe is a prominent social entrepreneur and thought leader .

"As the National Transportation Safety Board begins public hearings on Wednesday into the crash of an Asiana Airlines Boeing 777 in San Francisco in July, one question is certain to keep popping up: Have pilots become too dependent on computer systems to fly their airplanes? The simple answer is yes. When pilots become confused or overwhelmed by technology that was supposed to make their jobs easier or when they find themselves unable to regain control of their aircraft when a component in the computer system fails, the aviation industry needs to seriously assess the problem. Modern airliners use computers to handle just about every function imaginable -- from starting the engines and monitoring the cabin environment for the right temperature and pressure balance to handling the complex navigation necessary to fly an airplane safely between South Korea and San Francisco. Shaking free of any of the technology anywhere along the way is very difficult because so many of the aircraft's systems depend upon each other to work together. An airliner's automation today can handle almost all of a pilot's duties more smoothly and with better precision than any human. Computers have become so tightly integrated into the operation of an airliner, however, that the real problem is trying to carve out a few tasks the pilots can still call their own. One of the last completely human tasks is landing the airplane. With computers being tasked to perform so much of the work on each and every flight, pilots find their jobs have changed dramatically. Whereas once they were captains of the sky able to manipulate the flight controls to maneuver a 500,000-pound airplane through stormy skies and still plunk 300 people down at the destination safely, they now find themselves to be mere system monitors. Today, pilots program the computers before takeoff, making sure all the panel lights are green and then watch as the computers fly the aircraft most of the way. Is it any wonder that with so little practice actually manually handling the aircraft's flight controls and making many of the critical decisions that are now handed off to the computers that the pilots often find their minds wandering? We shouldn't be surprised that this happens. We all grow easily bored when we're forced to watch someone, or something, perform a task for hours on end, especially when we've been told that the computer pilot in this case probably flies better than we do anyway, at least most of the time. Consider Asiana 214's arrival at San Francisco. Facts uncovered during the initial investigation pointed to the pilot's failure to notice that a critical system called the auto-throttles was accidentally turned off. Auto-throttles let the computers control how much power the aircraft's engines produce to maintain a given airspeed. With the auto-throttle switched off, the pilots thought the computers were controlling power and airspeed, when in actuality, the computers were on standby. Basically, it means that no one was actually controlling the aircraft's altitude at that time. Without enough engine power, the aircraft's speed dropped too low to allow it to continue flying and it struck a dike just short of the runway, ripping away the landing gear. Three people died while over 180 people were injured. During the final few seconds of the approach to San Francisco, the pilots simply sat in the cockpit, apparently mesmerized by the view of the bay, assuming the computer was flying. The big question of course is why didn't they notice the computers were on standby? With the recent release of a study, ""Operational Use of Flight Path Management Systems,"" the aviation industry has begun to identify weaknesses in our aviation safety system, including potential problems in human-computer interactions. The report recommends improving pilot training to include more hands-on flying practice and more intensive classroom study about technology's shortcomings. It also calls for better cockpit designs that reduce potentially confusing messages, and up-to-date training to keep federal regulators ahead of the technology curve. The study has been turned over to the FAA, but no timeline or next steps in the process have been outlined. Without a defined plan of action soon, we may see another crash on the horizon before too long.","This week, public hearings take place on the crash of an Asiana Airlines Boeing 777 .

"Do you hate it when your mint gum makes your ice water taste too cold? Or your phone charger won't reach your bed? A group fighting for access to clean water in developing nations has created a fundraising video that takes such first world gripes and casts them in the stark light of poverty. In the 60-second video, the group WATERisLife has impoverished residents in Haiti, the poorest nation in the Western Hemisphere, recite tweets from the popular hashtag #FirstWorldProblems. The hashtag, a perpetual presence on Twitter, pokes fun at people who have more than the basics of life covered, and yet grumble when, say, their neighbor blocks off his wi-fi access. In the video, ""First World Problems Anthem,"" a man outside a dilapidated tin-roof house says ""I hate it when my house is so big, I need two wireless routers."" A young girl near a stream where women are washing clothes adds: ""When I leave my clothes in the washer so long they start to smell."" Another scene shows a boy sitting on the concrete steps of an unfinished cinder block house.  His ""gripe""? ""When I have to write my maid a check, but I forget her last name. ""#FirstWorldProblems Are Not Problems,"" the text at the end of the video reads. ""Donate to help bring clean water to those in need."" The lack of safe drinking water is the world's single largest cause of illness, according to UNICEF. And WATERisLIFE says that waterborne disease around the world this year will kill 6,500 people a day. ""We're not setting out to humiliate people who have used the #FirstWorldProblems hashtag,"" said Matt Eastwood, the chief creative officer of the ad agency DDB New York, which created the video.  ""Rather, the project encourages people to think before they tweet. There are much more important problems in the world than not getting a hot-enough latte in the morning."" The video has racked up more than 1.7 million hits in less than month. And the campaign may be having the desired impact. ""I used to think that first world problems were hilarious, but now I just feel﻿ bad."" says a comment posted under the video on YouTube. Another person laments:  ""Okay (it's) true﻿  i am a self centered stubborn brat. I have no idea how good i have it."" Ultimately, the clean water group is trying to benefit from a Twitter-inspired guilt trip. ""People are becoming desensitized to suffering and we needed to enter the social space with a provocative approach to get those who are lucky enough to have simple things such as water, food, and shelter to reflect on their 140 characters and support causes like WATERisLIFE,"" said Kristine Bender, the executive director of the nonprofit.","A video contrasts first world complaints with developing world ones .

"Iran on Sunday unveiled what it says is a copy of a U.S. stealth drone that it ""commandeered"" in 2011. ""The drone was brought down by the Iranian Armed Forces' electronic warfare unit which commandeered the aircraft and safely landed it,"" the Iranian Tasnim News Agency reported. Late last year, Iran announced it had ""managed to reverse engineer most parts"" of the drone, according to the Tasnim report. The U.S. drone was identified as the RQ-170 Sentinel, made by Lockheed Martin. Pictures of the aircraft taken during the unveiling ceremony attended by Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, were posted on Khamenei's official website. U.S. officials told CNN in December 2011 that the drone was part of a CIA reconnaissance mission that involved both the intelligence community and military personnel stationed in Afghanistan. Later that month, President Barack Obama asked Iran to return the drone to the U.S. ""We've asked for it back. We'll see how the Iranians respond,"" Obama said. ""No nation welcomes other countries' spy drones in its territory, and no one sends back the spying equipment and its information back to the country of origin,"" Gen. Hossein Salami, deputy commander of Iran's military, said at the time, according to the semiofficial Fars News Agency. In photos of Sunday's ceremony, the U.S. drone was on display alongside the Iranian copy. In February 2013, Iran said it had been able to decode surveillance footage from the captured drone and displayed it on YouTube. Iranian company wants to send toy drone to Obama .

"(CNN) -- Julien Smith, writer, speaker and now start-up chief executive, says he's good at ""predicting and following trends."" And now he's getting into another: Distributed space. Smith, co-author of books including Trust Agents, which explores how to use the web as a tool of influence and reached The New York Times bestseller list, revealed Breather at Le Web in London.

"To Jay DeLancy, North Carolina is fraught with voter fraud and the state is doing nothing about it. So the former Air Force veteran has taken matters into his own hands and vows, as he sees it, to save the system from eroding honest elections. DeLancy launched the Voter Integrity Project more than three years ago, leading a band of volunteers in scouring public records and knocking on doors to root out irregularities in voter rolls. It's tedious work, and DeLancy has generated mixed results as well as a measure of controversy. Some call his efforts ""sloppy"" and question whether he's addressing a serious shortcoming or whether he's become -- intended or not -- illustrative of the tough Republican-driven voter identification law that critics contend intimidates and disenfranchises minority voters. Moreover, this is all playing out amid hardening partisan divisions nationwide and legal and legislative battles as the nation hurtles toward a midterm vote with the Senate at stake and a presidential ballot in 2016. A man with a mission . At the VIP headquarters in a commercial office park in Raleigh that resembled many low-budget start-ups, complete with a dry-ink erase board, folding tables with chairs and a big wood, scuffed desk, DeLancy proudly walked through the inter workings of his organization that includes a few dozen volunteers spread around the state. Bald and 56, he seems at least a decade younger than his age. His enthusiasm screams through his rabidly opinionated professions about how voting should work. He thinks the mentally ill should be barred from voting, felons should be restored their voting right after they serve their sentence and probation, homeless people should be allowed to vote but only if they remain at the address they put on their voter registration form, and those who don't know the issues should stay home. DeLancy co-opted his tactics from True the Vote, a well-funded yet controversial conservative group in Texas that prioritizes citizen enforcement of the voter laws. Framed by a 12-foot long map of North Carolina divided into counties and congressional districts on loan from a Republican member of the state legislature, DeLancy also talks about the need for a strict photo ID law and that fraudulent voting is rampant in elections. And he's doing everything he can to ensure that his vision of the election system is carried out. To address their concerns, DeLancy and his volunteers plow through public data -- tax records, voting records, jury records, census data and death records - scouring for suspicion and inconsistencies. He compares tax data with DMV records, voting records in North Carolina with voting records in Florida, jury data with voter rolls. He calls it data mining. All this information is then inserted into an algorithm, creating spreadsheets upon spreadsheets for volunteers to investigate. When red flags are raised, they might turn it over to the Board of Elections or they might check it out themselves. Looking in a liberal bastion . In Buncombe County, which includes the western city of Asheville, a liberal bastion in a relatively conservative state, DeLancy's forces teamed with a local tea party group to analyze data. When five or more registered voters are listed at one address, a red flag goes up. Then they put on their shoes and pound the pavement. ""We would actually knock on the door at that address,"" DeLancy said. His volunteers would check to see who lived there and if it matched the records. The response? ""Some would slam the door in our face,"" DeLancy said, but added that others would answer their questions. If doubts persisted after confronting residences, they'd move to Stage Two. VIP would address a letter to the person in question. If the letter came back with ""return to sender,"" that letter became evidence to submit to the Board of Elections. DeLancy said a worst-case scenario would involve someone voting fraudulently or, at the very least, they need to be removed from the voter rolls for not living at the address listed. DeLancy took 180 cases to the Buncombe County elections board and a little more than half the names were stricken from the voter rolls. Jane Bilello, a volunteer with the Voter Integrity Project and head of the Asheville Tea Party who participated in the door-to-door checks, said the reason they are checking the voter rolls name by name is simple: ""We're doing it because the (political) parties aren't."" Tea party group in North Carolina might give up on national races . Vigilante or vindicator? DeLancy and his group are an aggravating nuisance whose tactics do more damage than good, according to fellow good governance groups with opposing ideological views. Sarah Zambon, president of Asheville League of Women Voters, said VIP targets minority and Democratic leaning districts, leading to voter disenfranchisement and voter intimidation. She said that of the 80 precincts in Buncombe County, all of VIP's challenges came from 11 precincts, most of them low income or minority -- communities that are more likely to have more people living under one roof. ""It has an intimidation effect,"" Zambon said, detailing the story of one African American woman who said she didn't feel comfortable when people showed up at her door and wanted to know where her sons lived. 2014 midterms: What's at stake . Zambon also said he has effectively removed homeless people from the voter rolls for not being at a fixed address. DeLancy shot back, saying Zambon needs to ""cut the emotion and deal with the facts."" ""Our laws are so lenient in favor of the voter that any person can claim they're homeless and vote from anywhere,"" DeLancy said. North Carolina's tamp down . North Carolina's election record is good. The Pew Charitable Trusts' election initiative named it one of the top-performing states in 2012. The organization cited increased voter registration, few problems with provisional ballots and minimal wait times at polls. Of the 88% of eligible voters are registered to vote, more than 65% voted in 2012, according to The Pew Charitable Trusts' Elections Performance Index and confirmed by the state. That turnout is similar to 2008 and both elections saw African Americans vote at a higher rate than whites, according to Democracy North Carolina, an election watchdog group. In addition, cases of fraud are negligible. The state's Board of Elections says fraud is possible but the state doesn't keep track. Elections board spokesman Josh Lawson said in the most recent statewide elections on May 6, one case of fraud was referred to the the local district attorney's office and he anticipates ""at least three other"" cases will be investigated by the board of elections. But still, the state enacted one of the most stringent voter ID laws in the country, requiring one of a limited number of forms of identification at the poll starting in 2016. The law also gives voter vigilantes more power, enabling citizens to challenge another person's vote anywhere in the state. Like laws of its kind that have been passed and challenged elsewhere, including in Pennsylvania and Wisconsin where the courts struck down the laws, North Carolina's law is being challenged for disenfranchising voters. Michael Cobb, political science professor at North Carolina State University, said the law discourages people to vote, adding that the state that voted for Democrat Barack Obama in 2008 and Republican Mitt Romney in 2012 has taken a step backward. 5 takeaways from North Carolina's primary election . ""They've gone the wrong direction in the importance of protecting the vote,"" Cobb said. ""They've erred on the side of making sure no ineligible person would vote."" While DeLancy aggressively advocated for the law, he pushed for a version that went even further. And thinks the state isn't doing enough to enforce the laws and that high voter participation is an indicator that fraud is rampant. Mixed results . After three years of work and countless volunteer hours, DeLancy has no cases of fraud to show. He cites, however, that the board of elections has made five ""referrals"" of prosecution to local district attorneys. He blames the Republican-led board of elections and the inherent difficulty in the system to confirm fraud in the election system. ""We thought with two Republicans in charge they would work with us,"" DeLancy said. ""Even when we do the right thing, the authorities don't really care."" His group also challenged 130 people who are on the voter rolls who got out of jury duty for saying they weren't a citizen. But the board of elections rejected their challenge. Despite falling short on the fraud front, the group has had some impact, including pushing the state to conduct more thorough list maintenance. He has played a role in removing about 30,000 people from the voter rolls, most of whom had died, which was confirmed by a state-led audit. That's in addition to an ongoing state issued review of another 155,000 people who are also registered in other states. And to the chagrin of some and the delight of others, they've helped to raise the issue to a whole new level in the state. ""They've caused bureaucratic wheels to turn,"" Cobb said. Lawson said they welcome the work DeLancy - and all good governance groups - are doing. The state is looking into some of VIP's findings, including 149 instancevs of people with the same name and birthday who voted in North Carolina and in Florida. But Bob Hall, executive director of Democracy North Carolina, a voter protection organization, said DeLancy's group does ""sloppy"" research and submits piles of claims to the board of elections to sift through with no substantial outcome. ""They have the appearance of being a research group but they operate like a witch hunt group,"" Hall said. ""That's not useful."" DeLancy dismisses his critics and states the overall goal. ""We want to figure out how people are voting multiple times. That's the whole ball game,"" he said.

"(CNN) -- Swimmer Michael Phelps, the most-decorated Olympian of all time, tweeted Sunday that he is taking a break from the sport ""to attend a program that will provide the help I need to better understand myself."" According to his official Twitter account, ""Swimming is a major part of my life, but right now I need to focus my attention on me as an individual."" The decision comes after he was charged last week with driving under the influence of alcohol, excessive speed and crossing double lines on Interstate 95 in Baltimore. The 22-time Olympic medalist, 29, was arrested Tuesday about 1:40 a.m. and later released, police said. According to media reports, police said his blood-alcohol content was .14. Last week's arrest is not Phelps' first run-in with the law . In 2004, he was arrested on charges of driving under the influence in Salisbury, Maryland. He pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 18 months probation. He also issued an apology after that incident. Five years later, a photograph of him smoking marijuana at a party surfaced. ""I'll make a million mistakes in my life, but as long as I never make the same mistake again, then I've been able to learn and grow,"" Phelps said in 2012.

"China, as one Twitter user wrote Tuesday, has been fooled by the ""mysterious Western art of satire."" The merciless comedy website The Onion has declared North Korean leader Kim Jong Un the ""sexiest man alive for 2012."" And it appears China's People's Daily Online has taken the story seriously. ""I love this one,"" Onion editor Will Tracy told CNN. ""It has a certain delightfulness to it."" The Chinese story reprinted satirical comments describing Kim's ""air of power that masks an unmistakable cute, cuddly side,"" his ""impeccable fashion sense, chic short hairstyle, and,"" the story says, ""that famous smile."" The story on People's Daily Online on Tuesday illustrates the mutual backscratching that China and North Korea exercise through their government-run media. The incident also shows foreign media outlets' difficulty in navigating The Onion's brand of satire. The Chinese website had underscored its story by including its own 55-page photo gallery to accompany the text, which was published in both English and Chinese. But the pages and the images were no longer available Wednesday. A woman responding to a call Wednesday to the office of the website said it was ""impossible that the People's Daily will quote from any unreliable media -- we do verify our news and sources.""

"The National Football League's new domestic violence policy will be tested just three days after it was implemented by Commissioner Roger Goodell. San Jose, California, police arrested the San Francisco 49ers' starting defensive end Ray McDonald on Sunday on felony domestic violence charges. Police say they responded at 2:48 a.m. to a reported incident, and after ""the domestic violence allegation was substantiated,"" they took the 6-foot-3, 290 pound lineman into custody and booked him. CNN affiliate KTVU reports that several of McDonald's 49er teammates were at his house at the time of the arrest. ""The 49ers organization is aware of the recent reports regarding Ray McDonald and we take such matters seriously. As we continue to gather the facts, we will reserve further comment,"" team General Manager Trent Baalke said in a statement. After he posted bail and was released from jail later Sunday, McDonald told KTVU he couldn't say much about what happened. ""The truth will come out,"" he said. ""Everybody knows what kind of person I am....a good-hearted person."" This isn't McDonald's first brush with the law, according to KTVU. The station says in 2010, McDonald was arrested for an outstanding warrant  stemming from a DUI arrest. Goodell announced on Thursday that the league was instituting a six-game unpaid ban for personnel who violate the league's policy on domestic violence. A second domestic violence incident would be punished by a lifetime ban from the league, Goodell said in a letter and memo to the owners of the league's 32 teams. The NFL had endured relentless criticism after only suspending Baltimore Ravens running back Ray Rice for two games, several months after video showed Rice dragging his unconscious fiancee -- whom he later married -- from an elevator. Without referring to Rice by name, Goodell acknowledged in his letter that he made the wrong decision in that case. ""I didn't get it right. Simply put, we have to do better. And we will,"" he wrote. The NFL Players Association responded on Thursday to Goodell's enhanced penalties . ""We were informed [Thursday] of the NFL's decision to increase penalties on domestic violence offenders under the Personal Conduct Policy for all NFL employees. As we do in all disciplinary matters, if we believe that players' due process rights are infringed upon during the course of discipline, we will assert and defend our members' rights,"" said the association's statement. McDonald, 29, is expected to play a key role in the 49ers defense this coming season. The team has already lost outside linebacker Aldon Smith, arguably its best defensive player, to a nine-game suspension for violating the NFL's substance abuse and personal conduct policies. McDonald has played almost all of the 49ers' games since 2008. He was drafted out of the University of Florida in 2007.","""The truth will come out,"" Ray McDonald tells CNN affiliate KTVU .

"Brian Banks wore the uniform of a prison inmate for more than five years, serving time for a rape he didn't commit. This week, he learned he'll be wearing an Atlanta Falcons jersey. Ten months after a California judge tossed out his conviction, the 27-year-old former high school football standout signed a deal Wednesday to play for the NFL team. ""Aside from getting my life back and my freedom back, this is the biggest accomplishment of my life,"" he told reporters during a conference call. As he signed the contract, he wore a sweatshirt that showed a California license plate that said  ""XONR8."" ""We are pleased to have Brian join our team,"" said Falcons general manager Thomas Dimitroff. ""We had a chance to work him out last year and have been monitoring his progress since then. He has worked extremely hard for this chance over the last year and he has shown us that he is prepared for this opportunity. We are happy that Brian will have a chance to live out his dream of playing in the NFL, and we look forward to seeing him on the field."" Banks, who is 6-foot-2 and 250 pounds, is a linebacker. A year ago, he was out of prison on parole, wearing an ankle monitor as a registered sex offender. The contrast with this week's events is ""surreal,"" Banks said. ""Talk about coming from the bottom,"" he told reporters. ""I know all too well what that is and what it looks like and what it feels like."" While serving time in prison, Banks said he was forced to abandon his hopes of playing in the NFL someday. ""I had to watch my class go on and receive scholarships and play collegiate football on a high level,"" he said. ""For me I had to let those dreams go for me to focus on what was ahead of me, and that was five years in prison. That was a completely different life of violence and being away from your family. ...  Football was the last thing on my mind, and it wasn't until a few months before I was actually being released from prison that I thought about possibly trying to play football again."" At age 17, fearing a potentially long sentence, the college football prospect followed the advice of his attorney and pleaded no contest to assaulting a Long Beach, California, high school classmate in 2002. ""Banks was faced with an impossible decision at the time -- either fight the charges and risk spending 41 years to life in prison, or take a plea deal and spend a little over five years of actual prison confinement,"" the California Innocence Project says on its website. ""Although it would mean destroying his chance to go to college and play football, a lengthy probationary period, and a lifetime of registration as a sex offender, Banks chose the lesser of two evils when he pleaded no contest to the charges."" Such situations are not uncommon, the group's director, Justin Brooks, told CNN last year. ""Plea bargains have become the 95% solution,"" he said. Banks maintained his innocence throughout his imprisonment, subsequent probation and registration as a sex offender. His fortunes began to change in 2011, when the woman who once accused him of rape sent him a Facebook friend request. According to the California Innocence Project, the woman later admitted that Banks had not kidnapped or raped her during a consensual encounter at Long Beach Polytechnic High School, where Banks was a middle linebacker with a scholarship offer from the University of Southern California. In court last year, an emotional Banks lowered his head and fought back tears when prosecutors said they were moving to have the conviction dismissed. ""We do not believe Mr. Banks did the crime he pled guilty to,"" Deputy District Attorney Brentford Ferreira said. ""Justice has been served."" Since his exoneration, Banks has spent months in intensive training, attending San Francisco 49ers and Seattle Seahawks minicamps last year. ""It's been a long road. It's been a lot of hard work. It is 10 years missing in my football career,"" he said, ""but there has been a lot of work put in to making up for it."" After signing his contract with the Falcons on Wednesday, Banks thanked the team's players and personnel from his Twitter account, @BrianBanksFREE.","Aside from his exoneration, Brian Banks says this is his life's ""biggest accomplishment""

"Tehran (CNN) -- Iranian centrist candidate Hassan Rouhani has won the country's presidential election, a victory that garnered both congratulations and skepticism around the world. Rouhani spoke of reforms without threatening Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, or the country's institutions -- of which he is product. The former national security council chief promised greater personal freedoms and indicated he would free political prisoners and jailed journalists. He takes the helm as Iran deals with sharp economic sanctions tied to international concern about its nuclear program. On Sunday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu cautioned the world against easing such sanctions. ""Regarding the results of the elections in Iran, let us not delude ourselves. The international community must not become caught up in wishes and be tempted to relax the pressure on Iran to stop its nuclear program,"" Netanyahu said at a weekly Cabinet meeting. The prime minister also said Iran's supreme leader ""disqualified candidates who did not fit his extremist outlook."" Read more: Rouhani, hawk or dove? In his campaigning, Rouhani pledged to improve the economy and unemployment. As a former nuclear negotiator, he said he would reduce the high tension between Iran and the outside world by addressing the sanctions. In a message through the semiofficial Fars News Agency, the 65-year-old Rouhani said the win ""is the victory of wisdom, moderation, growth and awareness, the victory of commitment and religiosity over extremism and ill tempers."" Global reactions . The British Foreign Office immediately urged Rouhani to help steer Iran in a new direction. ""We call on him to use the opportunity to set Iran on a different course for the future: addressing international concerns about Iran's nuclear program, taking forward a constructive relationship with the international community, and improving the political and human rights situation for the people of Iran,"" a Foreign Office spokesman said. The United States ""remains ready to engage the Iranian government directly in order to reach a diplomatic solution that will fully address the international community's concerns about Iran's nuclear program,"" the White House said. Read more: Will Iran shift policy on Syria? While the White House respected the vote, it said the election occurred ""against the backdrop of a lack of transparency, censorship of the media, Internet, and text messages, and an intimidating security environment that limited freedom of expression and assembly."" U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon offered his congratulations and called on Iran to take a ""constructive role in regional and international affairs."". Following Ahmadinejad . Rouhani succeeds outgoing President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, who was term-limited and could not run in the election. But Rouhani won't be Iran's most powerful man. That distinction belongs to Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who has been Iran's supreme leader since 1989. He's got plenty of backing, from conservative citizens to loyalist militia groups to, most notably, the Revolutionary Guard. On his website, the supreme leader said Rouhani is the president of all Iranians and told supporters of various candidates to set aside their differences and unify. Rouhani has all-round credentials in Iran's institutions that include senior cleric, former commander of Iranian air defenses and is an intellectual with three law degrees, including from a university in Scotland. Read more: The view from Tehran . He has a reputation for shunning extreme positions and bridging differences. While he has represented Khamenei on Iran's security council since 1989, he has avoided being perceived as a pushover and has taken exception with the supreme leader on being too rigid toward the international community, according to an Iranian scholar at Stanford University. Rouhani has accused state-run media of censorship and publishing lies. 'Not a democracy as we know it' Prior to the results, British Prime Minister David Cameron said the Iranian election system doesn't resemble a true democracy. ""We have to remember this is always only an election between a restricted number of candidates. It's not democracy as we know it,"" he told CNN's Richard Quest. Iran's Guardian Council, an unelected body made up of six clerics and six lawyers operating under the oversight of the supreme leader, drew up the restricted list of candidates from the 680 who initially registered. Read more: What's at stake in election? Eight candidates were approved, two of whom subsequently dropped out. The final six contenders didn't include any women. Nor did they include Ahmadinejad's aide and protege Esfandiar Rahim Mashaei, who was among those excluded by the Guardian Council. The only cleric among the candidates, he has close ties to Khamenei and served in Iran's parliament for two decades. He was also Iran's lead nuclear negotiator from 2003 to 2005 and holds seats on several powerful decision-making bodies. Remembering the 2009 chaos . Four years ago, when allegations of election fraud sparked widespread protests, Iran's police and the Basij, a feared paramilitary group, cracked down on the opposition Green Movement. Protesters were jailed, and human rights groups alleged many were tortured and killed behind bars while the government quashed the uprising. Reform politicians representing the movement, including Ahmadinejad's election rival, former Prime Minister Mir Hossein Moussavi, have been under house arrest since 2011. Despite the unrest, Ahmadinejad's re-election was formally certified by the clerical establishment. CNN's Shirzad Bozorgmehr reported from Tehran and Michael Martinez reported and wrote from Los Angeles. CNN's Holly Yan, Michael Schwartz, Laura Smith-Spark, Reza Sayah, Azadeh Ansari and Sara Mazloumsaki contributed to this report.","Hassan Rouhani succeeds Mahmoud Ahmadinejad as president .

"From his run-in with the cops to that time he was caught with marijuana, Brad Taylor certainly got into his fair share of trouble on ""Home Improvement."" But Zachery (Ty) Bryan, who played Tim ""The Tool Man"" Taylor's oldest son on the series for eight years, says he prides himself on being a child star ""that's done well."" ""I had phenomenal parents,"" he told CNN. ""They kept me very grounded, and I lived a normal life."" A life that included playing team sports and attending ""regular school"" during his time off from filming. Since the show concluded in 1999, Bryan has appeared on episodes of ""Boston Public,"" ""Center of the Universe"" and ""Veronica Mars."" He can also be seen in 2006's ""The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift."" But the former child star no longer makes a living in front of the camera. Now known as Zachery Bryan (he dropped his middle name shortly after ""Home Improvement"" ended), the 30-year-old works as a producer in Beverly Hills. Bryan founded Vision Entertainment Group Inc. with his friend Adam Targum in 2009. "" 'Home Improvement' was the key in the ignition that started the engine,"" he said. ""It not only was financially great for me and my family, but it was such a learning experience. ... I can sit in a meeting with someone twice my age and have close to the same experience. I've always looked at 'Home Improvement' and my early-age success as an opportunity to learn and be able to eventually put on this cap that I'm wearing now."" For now, Bryan says, that cap will be worn solely behind the camera. ""[Acting] is not my primary focus right now, but I never count it out,"" he said, noting that he doesn't plan on appearing in any of the films he produces. Ever since the ""Home Improvement"" cast reunited for an Entertainment Weekly photo shoot in 2011, fans have been crossing their fingers for a reunion episode. Of course, the Taylor family patriarch is busy starring on ""Last Man Standing,"" which is essentially ""Home Improvement"" with three daughters. ""(Tim Allen) is a smart man,"" Bryan said. Despite his preference for comedies and love stories, Bryan's production company produced the horror film ""Rogue River,"" which comes out on DVD Tuesday.

"In January of 2011, at 25, I was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. I went through four months of chemotherapy and eight weeks of radiation. As of this writing, one and half years later, I'm happy to be in remission, but many people think that is where the battle ends. For me, that's where the real fight began. After all of the procedures were over and my hair finally grew back, the physical side of being a cancer patient was behind me. There was some relief in knowing that I'd no longer have to spend hours over the toilet vomiting partially digested Jell-O because that was the only semi-solid food my body would tolerate. It was also refreshing to know that my appearance was slowly morphing from a powdery white, emaciated, bald, albino-looking bag of bones to a somewhat normal and healthy 25-year-old guy. But shortly after the treatment stopped, the psychological stress of being a cancer patient set in. Every month, since my last day of radiation, I go to my doctor for a battery of tests designed to determine whether my cancer has come back and whether the treatment caused any residual side effects. It's a seven-day process that causes more mental anguish than any single person deserves. The week begins with blood tests and scans. Then, I go home and wait seven days for the doctor to tell me whether I'm still in remission. The period in between the tests and the results is the worst. Every time my phone rings, my heart sinks. I wonder if it's my oncologist calling to deliver bad news. Are we close to beating cancer? My mind spends a lot of time analyzing the ""what if"" scenarios. What if it comes back? Will I go through the treatment again? What if the chemotherapy and radiation caused some other form of cancer or did it cause a genetic mutation that's going to force me to be isolated from the human population and live in a clean room forever? I try to run every possibility through my head. That way, I'm be prepared for whatever news I'm given. On the seventh day, I drive myself back to the cancer center, check in and wait for about two hours for my 15-minute appointment. (My doctor has a problem with punctuality.) In the waiting room, I sit with many other cancer patients. Some wear surgical masks to protect them from germs, while others are in wheelchairs. Their situations seem far worse than mine was, so I don't complain. After reading 16 magazines cover-to-cover, mostly about how to prevent cancer, and several rounds of counting the floor tiles, the nurse calls my name. My heart, once again, sinks because I know I'm about to learn my fate. I try to play it cool and act calm, but after she takes my vital signs, my cover is blown. ""Are you nervous, Mr. Curry? Don't be nervous,"" she says. That's easy for her to say. She then peels the Velcro cuff off my arm and walks me to the examination room where I wait for the doctor. A few minutes later, he knocks on the door and then enters the room. He's usually carrying an iPad and some papers. ""Good news, Mr. Curry,"" he says. ""The tests show no evidence of disease."" A sense of relief comes over me and my sphincter muscles loosen. More lives being saved: Cancer death rates drop 20% . Before I leave, the doctor hands me the paper with the test results. I treat it like a trophy or diploma. I never fold the document, and I save all of them. Before leaving, I make another appointment for next month, so I can then start the same process all over again. They tell me I'll have to do this for the next five years. In between appointments, any cough, ache or pain forces me to wonder whether it's cancer growing in my body. As a cancer survivor, it's something I can't help but think of. As time goes on, I'm getting better at managing the stress. The monthly exams are a small price to pay for staying alive. Some aren't so lucky.","James Curry was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in 2011 .

"Russian forces moved Saturday to consolidate control over Crimea. Six Russian special forces' armored personnel carriers broke through the gates of Belbek Airbase, firing warning shots into the air, a spokesman for Ukraine's Ministry of Defense in Crimea, Vladislav Seleznev, told CNN. One journalist was injured in the attack, he said. Once inside, the Russians lined up the Ukrainians in one place, he said. In a separate incident, pro-Russian self-defense forces stormed the Novofederoskoe military base, also in Crimea, taking control of it, a Ukraine defense ministry spokesman said Saturday. Ukrainian forces on the base threw smoke bombs during the incident and retreated to the base's headquarters, according to Seleznev, in a Facebook posting. The base's aviation brigade then sang the Ukrainian national anthem, lowered the Ukrainian flag and left the base, he said. The White House reacted by urging Russia to open talks with the Ukrainian government. ""As we have said, the Russian military is directly responsible for any casualties that its forces -- whether they be regular uniformed troops or irregulars without insignias -- inflict on Ukrainian military members,"" said Laura Lucas Magnuson, a spokeswoman for the National Security Council, in a statement. The reports ""highlight the dangerous situation created by Russia and belie President (Vladimir) Putin's claim that Russia's military intervention in Crimea has brought security to that part of Ukraine."" The incidents occurred as international observers were set to arrive in Ukraine to monitor the security and human rights situation in a posting expected to last at least six months. But they will not enter the contested region of Crimea, a statement from the Russian Foreign Ministry said, because this ""became part of Russia."" Moscow annexed the territory this week following a controversial snap referendum there that produced an overwhelming majority of votes in favor of leaving Ukraine to join Russia. The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe will eventually deploy a total of 100 observers throughout Ukraine in hopes of ""reducing tensions and fostering peace, stability and security."" They will also check that the rights of ethnic minorities are being protected. Advance teams were to be deployed within 24 hours, the OSCE said Friday. The regional security organization may widen the mission to include 400 more monitors, and extend it for a second six-month period if requested by the Kiev government. Russia, which is one of the OSCE's 57 member states, approved the mission, according to state-run Russian news agency, RIA Novosti. Russia's Foreign Ministry said it hoped the observers' work would ""help to overcome the internal Ukrainian crisis, stop rampant nationalist banditry, eradicate ultra-radical tendencies, help achieve national reconciliation and social respect, political, linguistic, educational, cultural and religious rights of the people in all regions of Ukraine."" Russia has previously said it reserves the right to enter Ukrainian territory to protect ethnic Russians from what it says is a threat from ultra-nationalists and fascists. Meanwhile, European leaders have demanded that independent monitors be granted access to the Crimean peninsula, which Russia now calls its own territory. OSCE monitors made multiple attempts to enter Crimea during the height of the crisis when pro-Russian militias took control of the region. But armed men at the borders turned them back. Ukraine, the United States and other Western powers maintain that the Black Sea peninsula is still a part of Ukraine. ""We must not allow a new division of Europe,"" German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier said Saturday in Kiev, where he met with with Ukrainian Prime Minister Arseny Yatsenyuk and acting President Oleksandr Turchinov. Yatsenyuk also met Saturday with U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, who then reiterated that any solution must be a diplomatic one and called for direct talks between Kiev and Moscow, the U.N. spokesperson said in a statement. Kiev going West . Yatsenyuk signed the political elements of a trade pact with the European Union on Friday as Russian lawmakers finalized annexation of Ukraine's Crimea region. The signing in Brussels signaled Europe's solidarity with Ukraine and carries additional symbolic force. It was the decision by Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych in November to ditch the trade pact in favor of closer ties with Russia that triggered the protests that led to his ouster in February and spiraled into the current crisis. On Saturday, Ukraine's Chief Prosecutor Oleg Mohnitsky, Deputy Prosecutor Alexei Baganets and Interior Minister Arsen Avakov told reporters that raids carried out Friday on apartments and offices linked to two of Yanukovych's cabinet members had turned up signs of corruption -- millions of dollars in cash, gold and jewels. Putin, flanked by the speakers of both houses of Russia's Parliament, signed a treaty Friday finalizing the accession to Russia of the Crimea region and its port city of Sevastopol. Russia's Black Sea Fleet is based in Sevastopol, making it strategically important to Moscow. The region also has a majority ethnic Russian population and long historical ties to Russia. Although Russia insists that its actions are legitimate, Ukraine's interim government has said Kiev will never stop fighting for Crimea. The Ukrainian naval fleet's sole submarine has been taken over by the Russians, a spokesman for Ukraine's Defense Ministry said Saturday. The Zaporizhia was taken over and placed under the flag of the Russian naval fleet when its commander abandoned it after deciding not to join with Russian forces, Seleznev, the Ukraine defense spokesman, told CNN. The incident occurred near Sevastopol, in Striletska Bay. The Soviet-era diesel-electric submarine is more than 40 years old, but was upgraded by Russian engineers a couple of years ago, according to the state-run news agency Ria Novosti. Seleznev later said on his Facebook page -- citing sources in Sevastopol -- that Crimean self-defense forces and Russian special forces had taken another Ukrainian ship, the Slavutych. The ship was captured ""after a two-hour assault,"" Seleznev said, though the Ukrainian ship's crew members came ashore and didn't suffer any injuries. Fighting for Crimea . Moscow has doggedly pursued its own course even as Western leaders have denounced its actions as violations of Ukraine's sovereignty and a breach of international law. U.S. President Barack Obama plans to meet with leaders of the G7 group of industrialized nations next week to discuss Ukraine. Russia has been excluded from the talks on the sidelines of a nuclear summit in the Netherlands. A planned EU-Russia summit has also been canceled, as the West seeks to increase Moscow's isolation over its actions in Ukraine. And a spokesman for the Mayor of London, Boris Johnson, said Friday he had canceled a planned high-level trade visit to Moscow in October. That step followed a new round of sanctions imposed by EU leaders Thursday against 12 individuals. Those sanctions brought to 33 the total number of people facing EU asset freezes and travel bans. Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman Aleksandr Lukashevich dismissed the latest move by EU leaders in a statement posted to the Foreign Ministry website Saturday. ""It is a pity that the European Council adopted a decision which is divorced from reality,"" he said. ""Russia reserves the right to give an adequate response to the undertaken action."" The United States announced its own new round of sanctions on Thursday against 20 individuals and a bank which U.S. officials say is linked to Putin and senior Russian officials. Washington had already announced sanctions on 11 individuals. Further sanctions which would target Russia's economic interests are threatened by both the European Union and the United States if Moscow does not act to deescalate the situation. Travel warning . The United States is keeping a close eye on the large-scale drills Russia's military are conducting near Ukraine's eastern border with the country. National Security Adviser Susan Rice said Friday it's ""not clear"" what is signaled by Russia massing its forces near the border -- and suggested Washington is wary. ""The Russians have stated that they are intending military exercises,"" she said. ""Obviously, given their past practice and the gap between what they have said and what they have done, we are watching it with skepticism."" Rice also praised the Ukrainian people and government for their ""enormous restraint in the face of obvious provocation."" She added, ""They've made clear that their interest is in a unified, democratic future that is ... in an existence at peace with both Russia and with western Europe and the United States."" The U.S. State Department also issued a travel warning for Ukraine Friday. It cautioned U.S. citizens ""to defer all non-essential travel to Ukraine and to defer all travel to the Crimean Peninsula and eastern regions of Kharkiv, Donetsk and Lugansk due to the presence of Russian military forces in the Crimean Peninsula."" While the transition to a new government has been largely peaceful, some clashes have broken out in eastern regions, the State Department said, and ""groups advocating closer ties to Russia have taken on a more strident anti-American tone, especially in Crimea.""

"(CNN) -- The Nobel prize-winning biologist who caused a furor with comments about the intelligence of black people resigned Thursday from his longtime post at a renowned research lab. James Watson won the 1962 Nobel prize for discovering the structure of DNA. In a statement announcing his departure from the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory on New York's Long Island, Dr James Watson did not mention the comments but instead cited ""events"" which led to his decision. ""The circumstances in which the transfer is occurring,"" he wrote, ""are not those which I could ever have anticipated or desired."" The lab's board had already suspended him pending a review of his remarks, for which Watson apologized last week. The controversy began with an interview with Watson published October 14 in Britain's Sunday Times. Watson was quoted as saying he was ""inherently gloomy about the prospect of Africa"" because ""all our social policies are based on the fact that their intelligence is the same as ours, whereas all the testing says not really."" He also asserted there was no reason to believe different races separated by geography should have evolved identically, and that while he hoped everyone was equal, ""people who have to deal with black employees find this is not true."" Watson had been on a tour of the United Kingdom to promote his new book, and the comments led several venues to cancel his planned appearances. The 79-year-old biologist apologized ""unreservedly"" last week and said he did not understand how he could have made the quoted remarks. The paper stood by its interview. Watson won the 1962 Nobel prize for his role in discovering the double-helix structure of DNA. He had been chancellor of the lab and served on its board for 43 years, but he said it was now time to retire. ""Closer now to 80 than 79, the passing on of my remaining vestiges of leadership is more than overdue,"" he wrote. Watson said he was proud of the laboratory's legacy and reputation as one of the world's leading sites for biological research and education. Specifically, Watson mentioned cancer research as one of the lab's achievements. Eduardo Mestre, chairman of the lab's board, said Watson had made ""immeasurable contributions"" to the lab's research and that the board respected his decision to retire. The lab's director, Bruce Stillman, credited Watson with raising the lab's profile. ""Jim's legacy will not only include CSHL and the double helix, but his pioneering efforts that led to the sequencing of the human genome and his innovations in science writing and education."" Watson had made controversial remarks in the past. In 1997, Britain's Sunday Telegraph quoted Watson as saying that if a gene for homosexuality were isolated, women who find that their unborn child has the gene should be allowed to have an abortion. During a lecture tour in 2000, he suggested there might be links between skin color and sexual prowess, and between a person's weight and their level of ambition. And in a British TV documentary that aired in 2003, Watson suggested that stupidity was a genetic disease that should be treated.

"A former aide to then-presidential candidate John Edwards testified Tuesday he helped cover up Edwards' affair with a campaign videographer. The scheme, according to Andrew Young, included him claiming he was the father of Rielle Hunter's child to protect Edwards. Young is the star government witness against Edwards, who is accused of using hundreds of thousands of dollars from 101-year-old heiress Rachel ""Bunny"" Mellon and another donor to conceal his affair with Hunter. The candidate asked him to allow Hunter to move in with his family in North Carolina after newspapers began looking into a possible affair in the campaign, Young testified. The woman lived with the family three months and expected others to dote on her, Young said. ""She could go shopping at Neiman Marcus, but she couldn't go to grocery store,"" said Young. More serious was Young's description of how money was allegedly funneled beginning in late 2007. Young, the first witness in the trial, said Mellon was an enthusiastic supporter who apologized for not being able to give the campaign more than $1 million. Mellon made personal checks out to her interior decorator, who would write checks that would end up in the account of Young and his wife, the witness told jurors. Hunter eventually moved to a gated community and the money was used to pay $2,700 monthly rent and purchases of furniture, television and a BMW, Young said. Hunter also was given a credit card bearing a different name. Prosecutors say Edwards broke federal law by accepting about $725,000 from Mellon and more than $200,000 from Fred Baron, a now-deceased Texas lawyer who was his finance chairman. The money was used to pay for Hunter's living and medical expenses, travel and accommodations to keep her out of sight while he made his second White House run in 2008, prosecutors say. Edwards is accused of concealing the money from the public and the Federal Election Commission, which polices political contributions, by filing false and misleading campaign disclosure reports. Young is testifying for the prosecution under a cooperation agreement with the hope that he won't be prosecuted. Young, who has not undergone cross-examination, also testified that Edwards made a disparaging comment about his mistress after she called to say she was pregnant. ""She was crying, she was distraught, and she needed to speak with Mr. Edwards immediately,"" Andrew Young told jurors about his conversation in 2007 with Hunter. ""I said, 'Somebody better be pregnant or dying. She said, 'nobody's dying,' "" Young recounted. He said he told Edwards about Hunter's pregnancy. Young quoted Edwards as replying that, "" 'She's a crazy slut' and there's a 1-in-3 chance it was his child."" Reporters located a pregnant Hunter at a Cary, North Carolina, grocery story in December 2007 and two men came to his house, Young said. ""They knew about affair between Ms. Hunter and Mr. Edwards and they wanted to ask me about it,"" said Young. The cover-up, according to Young, began the next day when he got a call from Edwards. Edwards proposed that the campaign's account of an affair would be between two staffers -- Hunter and Young, the latter testified. Eventually, all parties agreed to the plan, with Edwards thanking his aide. ""We had been lying a great deal, but also what he was saying rang true, we believed in the causes,"" Young said. ""I wanted my friend to be president. Being friends with the most powerful person on Earth, there's benefits for you, your family."" Edwards admitted his affair with Hunter in 2008, after his presidential ambitions foundered. In 2010, he admitted that he was the father of Hunter's daughter. ""This affair was a gamble with exceedingly high stakes,"" prosecutor David Harbach told jurors during Monday's opening statements. ""If the affair went public, it would have destroyed any chance to become president, and he knew it. Two of his most enthusiastic supporters happened to be wealthy, and he knew that, too. He made a choice to accept hundreds of thousands of dollars. He made a choice to break the law."" Young also testified Tuesday that Hunter was upset because Edwards wouldn't return her calls. ""If I don't talk to him immediately, this is over. I'm tired of living a lie. I'm going to go public,"" Hunter said, according to Young. Edwards indicated that Hunter needed to be kept on an allowance, said Young. ""$5,000 a month was the typical amount, but there were a couple of times where we gave $12,000 a month,"" said Young. According to Young, Edwards tried to distance himself from the Mellon money of which he was aware while he was interested in becoming U.S. attorney general in a new Democratic administration. ""He said he couldn't know about any of this in case he had to be sworn in for attorney general,"" Young said. Young is the author of ""The Politician: An Insider's Account of John Edwards's Pursuit of the Presidency and the Scandal That Brought Him Down,"" in which he accuses Edwards of using money from his benefactors to maintain his relationship with Hunter. The defense argues that the money Edwards received from Mellon and Baron was for personal reasons: to protect Edwards' wife, Elizabeth, who was dying of cancer, and his family from public humiliation. Edwards has said his actions were wrong but insisted that they were not illegal. ""This was a fall from grace,"" defense attorney Allison Van Laningham told jurors. ""It was that humiliation he was trying to avoid all along."" Edwards could face up to 30 years in prison if convicted of all six felony and misdemeanor counts against him. Seven of the 16 jurors, four of whom are alternates, are women. Edwards' lawyers wasted no time attacking Young's credibility, starting with their opening statements Monday. Van Laningham alleged that Young consulted with three other witnesses about testimony after the witness list was released three weeks ago and portrayed him as a greedy staffer who has said Edwards is his ticket to the top. Van Laningham also pointed out that Young had his own affair, a one-night stand with a campaign employee. Experts say the government faces an uphill battle to convict Edwards in a legal field riddled with loopholes. The former senator refused a plea bargain to misdemeanor charges that would have given him a few months in prison but would have allowed him to keep his law license. His wife, Elizabeth, died of cancer in December 2010. The pair had separated after Edwards acknowledged the paternity of Hunter's child, but Edwards was at her bedside when she died. Jurors also heard voice mails of calls between Edwards and Young. In one excerpt, the candidate tells Young he should tell his wife about the situation. And a January 2008 call by Edwards made a reference to Hunter, according to Young: . ""Just wanted for all of you, including her, to know that I'm thinking about you.""","Ex-aide Andrew Young testifies he helped cover up John Edwards' affair .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- House Democrats on Thursday failed to override President Bush's veto of a children's health insurance bill that opponents said was too expensive. Musician Paul Simon, left, joins House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to oppose Bush's veto of the SCHIP bill. By a vote of 273 to 156, the measure fell 13 votes short of the two-thirds majority needed for an override. Forty-four Republicans voted for the override. ""Now is the time for Congress to stop playing politics and to join the president in finding common ground,"" said a White House statement after the vote. Bush was ""pleased,"" the statement said, that the ""misguided legislation"" was defeated. Democrats, sensing earlier that they didn't have the votes, vowed to continue the fight, despite a defeat. The issue has ignited an intense two-week struggle on Capitol Hill after Bush vetoed the proposed five-year expansion and $35 billion spending increase. Bush proposes increasing the program by $5 billion. Before the vote, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi spoke of a middle-class family caring for a child with a birth defect, asking lawmakers: ""So when the president wants to have 4 or $5 billion for children in this initiative, is he the one, the decider, who wants to go to that family and say, 'Your child is out'?"" ""We're lobbying for all of the children,"" said the California Democrat.  Watch Democrats pull out all the stops » . Minority Leader Rep. John Boehner explained his and other opponents' stance on the bill. ""What we've been working towards is trying to find a way to say that we ought to insure poor children first,"" said the Ohio Republican. ""Let's not let this become another Washington program that starts with one principle of mind and then becomes something for everyone."" It was the fourth veto of Bush's term.  See veto record »   On its first go-round, the House passed it with 45 Republican votes -- about two dozen votes short of the two-thirds majority. Earlier, Pelosi said Bush ""is alone,"" in his stance on the bill, ""and he's dragging some of his House members with him down this path."" Bush said Wednesday that the congressional plan would ""encourage people to move from private medicine to the public."" Another member of the Democratic House leadership, Rahm Emanuel of Illinois, vowed Thursday that they would not let up. ""There will be no compromise on 10 million children's health care,"" Emanuel told CNN. ""We won't go above it, but we ain't going below it. ""The American people support this issue because kids do not need to suffer for what is basically a broken health care system, and this provides those children  with that health care,"" Emanuel said. The SCHIP program covers about 6 million children whose parents earn too much to qualify for Medicaid, the federally funded program providing health care for the poor, but can't afford private health insurance. The bill the House and Senate passed in September would extend eligibility for the program to about 4 million more, paying for the expansion with a 61-cent-per-pack increase in the federal tax on cigarettes. A CNN/Opinion Research Corp. poll released Wednesday found strong support for Democrats' efforts to override the veto. The poll found 61 percent of Americans believe Congress should overrule Bush, while 35 percent believe the veto should be sustained. Pollsters interviewed 1,212 people from Friday through Sunday. The survey has a sampling error of 3 percentage points. Bush stood firm during a Wednesday news conference. ""I made clear that, if putting poor children first requires more than the 20 percent increase in funding I proposed, we'll work with Congress to find the money we need,"" said the president. ""I'm confident we can work out our differences and reauthorize SCHIP."" Bush complained that administration officials ""weren't dialed in"" to the plans, ""and I don't know why. But they just ran the bill, and I made it clear we weren't going to accept it."" The bill passed the Senate with the support of prominent Republicans such as Sens. Orrin Hatch of Utah and Charles Grassley of Iowa. House Republican leaders have complained that Democrats postponed the override attempt for two weeks to use the issue for political advantage. A coalition of labor and advocacy groups had been pounding Republicans with a nearly $1 million television ad campaign on cable networks featuring children who have received benefits from the program. The House Democratic campaign committee has paid for radio ads and automated calls to voters in GOP-held districts it considers competitive in 2008. Democrats say they would need to peel off about 14 Republicans in the House to be able to enact the bill over Bush's veto. Republican staffers tell CNN that Rep. Bobby Jindal, who is running for governor of Louisiana, is expected to join Democrats in supporting the override. Jindal did not vote on the original bill. Meanwhile, of the eight Democrats who voted against the bill in September, only one has said he will reverse his vote and support an override. Rep. Mike McIntyre, who described his North Carolina district as ""Tobacco Road,"" told CNN on Monday that the debate ""is no longer about the tobacco tax, but really about whether we're going to help our children."" Democratic Rep. Diane Watson of California, who declined to vote on the original bill, has agreed to vote for the override, House Democratic Whip Rep. Jim Clyburn said. Niki Tsongas, the widow of former Sen. Paul Tsongas who won a special election Tuesday to replace Massachusetts Democrat Rep. Marty Meehan, will be sworn in Thursday morning in time for the vote.

"Kendrick Johnson's family waited months for hundreds of hours of surveillance video, hoping it would answer their questions. It raised only others. Rather than showing how their 17-year-old son's body ended up in a school gym mat in January, the four cameras inside the Valdosta, Georgia, gymnasium showed only a few collective seconds of Johnson, jogging. The camera fixed on the gym mats was blurry. Compounding the family's suspicions was the nature of the gym videos. They're jumpy, with students intermittently appearing and vanishing, and they bear no obvious timestamps. The Johnsons' attorneys were not shy in stating their suspicion that someone could have tampered with the videos. ""They know their child did not climb into a wrestling mat, get stuck and die. Where is that video?"" Benjamin Crump asked. Attorney Chevene King questioned why time codes weren't shown in the videos. ""We don't have any time code with which to synchronize the events that are shown in the video. ... Either the cameras did this on their own or a human being interacted to make these cameras do these things,"" King said. Crump further said the family believes someone ""corrupted"" the video. Lowndes County Schools insists the video is ""a raw feed with no edits,"" and the Lowndes County Sheriff's Office, which asserts Johnson accidentally died while reaching for a shoe in one of the mats, says it didn't edit any files, according to their lawyers. CNN, which filed suit to secure access to the video, hired forensic video analyst Grant Fredericks to analyze more than 290 hours of material from all 35 cameras inside and outside of the gym. Fredericks is a U.S. Justice Department consultant and contract instructor for the FBI National Academy in Quantico, Virginia. CNN also provided Fredericks and his company, the Spokane, Washington-based Forensic Video Solutions, with hundreds more hours of video from 31 cameras in other parts of Lowndes County High School. Fredericks quickly knocked down the Johnsons' concerns -- they're all easily explained, he said -- but his examination raised what could be another mystery: at least an hour of missing video from all four cameras inside the gym. ""Those files are not original files,"" Fredericks said. ""They're not something investigators should rely on for the truth of the video."" Addressing the Johnsons' suspicions, Fredericks said the erratic motion in the video can be attributed to motion sensors triggering the cameras' recording function, and the blurriness on the camera homing in on the gym mats is the product of an out-of-focus lens. As for the time stamp, it's there; investigators just need to know where to look, he said. Coroner slams handling of Kendrick Johnson case . Fredericks was able to find a little more than 18 minutes of video showing Johnson throughout the school on January 10. He's first seen at 7:31 a.m. entering school and last seen at 1:09 p.m., walking into the gym where he was found dead the next day. What Fredericks wasn't able to find was video showing whether there was anyone in the gym when Johnson was there -- images that could prove vital in determining how the teen died. ""(The surveillance video has) been altered in a number of ways, primarily in image quality and likely in dropped information, information loss,"" he said. ""There are also a number of files that are corrupted because they've not been processed correctly and they're not playable. I can't say why they were done that way, but they were not done correctly, and they were not done thoroughly. So we're missing information."" Two cameras in the gym are missing an hour and five minutes, their hiatus ending at 1:09, when Johnson enters the gym. Another pair of cameras are missing two hours and 10 minutes each. They don't begin recording again until 1:15 and 1:16, according to their time stamps. What's certain, based on video from a camera outside the gym, is that numerous students walked into the gym during the hour and five minutes that the cameras weren't recording, but it's not clear whether that was sufficient to activate the cameras' motion sensors. The time stamp on a camera outside the gym also appears to be 10 minutes behind the cameras inside the gym. ""I can't tell you whether there was no information recorded in the digital video system or whether somebody made an error and didn't capture it or whether somebody just didn't provide it,"" Fredericks said. CNN has requested access to the original surveillance servers. But Fredericks cautions that the video could be gone, as newer surveillance would replace it if it wasn't recovered promptly from the school's digital video recorder. The police have said they didn't receive a copy of the videos until several days after Johnson's body was found, according to an unredacted report obtained by CNN after a legal process. Fredericks told CNN he found it ""highly suspicious"" that an hour of video could be missing, especially considering how the material was acquired by police. ""The investigator's responsibility is to acquire the entire digital video recording system and have their staff define what they want to obtain,"" he said. According to an incident report from the Sheriff's Office, however, a detective watched a portion of the video then asked an information technology officer employed by the school board to produce a ""copy of the surveillance video for the entire wing of the school with the old gym for the last 48 hours."" Five days later, the sheriff's report says, the IT officer delivered a hard drive to the detective, who verified it contained what he requested. ""Right now, what they've done, is they've left it up to the school district as to what it is they want to provide to the police, and I think that probably is a mistake,"" Fredericks said. ""You don't want somebody who might be party to the responsibility to make the decision as to what they provide the police."" He added, ""Until I have the digital video system in my hand and I can say, or an investigator can say, 'Everything is intact, and this is what was recorded,' I would still be highly suspicious of this."" The Johnson family will now have to wait to see whether the school's surveillance servers shed more light on their son's death, but the teen's parents say they won't be deterred. ""We are Kendrick Johnson,"" his mother, Jacquelyn Johnson, said. ""That's my child, and we're going to fight until it's all over, until we get the truth. That's all we've ever asked for -- was the truth about what happened to Kendrick Johnson.""

"An appeals judge in Qatar on Sunday cleared American couple Matthew and Grace Huang of starving their adopted daughter to death in 2013, in a case that drew global attention to the Middle Eastern nation's justice system. However, the couple were blocked from leaving Qatar on Sunday by immigration officials at Hamad International Airport, who confiscated their passports, according to the Doha News agency, which cited a family spokesman Eric Volz. A new warrant had been issued for their arrest on unknown charges, the agency cited Volz as saying. The couple remained at the airport Sunday night with the U.S. Ambassador to Qatar, Dana Shell Smith, Doha News reported. Earlier, Matthew Huang issued a statement thanking the Qatari judge for his decision. ""This has been an emotional trial for me and my family,"" Matthew Huang said in a statement. ""Grace and I want to go home and be reunited with our sons. We have not been able to grieve our daughter's death, but we want to thank the judge for today's decision."" The Huangs -- who were living in Qatar while Matthew Huang worked for a international company working on construction projects for the 2022 World Cup -- were arrested in January 2013 when their 8-year-old daughter Gloria died. They were charged with starving her to death, convicted in March and sentenced to three years in prison. The Qatari prosecutor sought to paint Grace and Matthew Huang as inhumane -- alleging they bought their adopted daughter cheaply from her poverty-stricken parents in Africa -- and had threatened to seek human trafficking charges. The couple spent nearly a year in prison before being freed in November 2013 pending their appeal. In explaining his decision to overturn the conviction, Judge Abdulrahman al-Sharafi cited weaknesses in forensic reports and said the trial judge failed to properly consider testimony from witnesses who said Gloria wasn't deprived. A report by pathologists hired by the defense, obtained by CNN, stated they found no evidence tissue samples were taken from Gloria's body after her death, despite the fact Qatari investigators submitted an autopsy report. Advocates for the Huangs suggested the lab report was fabricated and said their request with the Qatari judiciary for a formal investigation went unanswered. Criticism of Qatari justice . The case against the Huangs shined a light on the Qatari justice system and drew complaints from the United States. Qatar is a key ally in the U.S.-led coalition against the terror group ISIS and host to many countries' forces involved in airstrikes. The Qatari government also helped the United States secure the release of Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl from Taliban captivity this year. Despite the close ties, the State Department expressed concern. Officials requested in October that Qatar's government lift the Huangs' travel ban, allowing them to return to the United States. ""The 22 long months of court proceedings following their daughter's tragic death have compounded the tragedy for the Huang family, and it is time now, as the Appeals Court stated, to let the Huangs return home,"" U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said in a statement. ""We are deeply concerned about new delays that have prevented their departure,"" he said. A United Nations special rapporteur investigating the justice system in Qatar also called attention to the Huangs' case and urged the government to release them and send them home. Fighting family . After the couple's arrest, their two sons, also adopted from Africa, were temporarily placed in a Qatari orphanage. They have since been sent back to the United States to live with Grace Huang's mother. The entire family chipped in during the prolonged separation. With Matthew Huang fired from his job, the couple are living on donations from family and friends. Grace Huang's brother, Daniel Chin, gave up his job in California to work on the case full time. He was the nerve center of the family, raising money for expenses and defense costs and dealing with the Huangs' lawyers and advocates. Their focus on their fate took away from time for them to grieve Gloria's loss. ""Everything has revolved around her case and our situation,"" Grace Huang said. ""We haven't had a chance to really say goodbye and mourn. We just really want to be able to honor her place in our lives with our friends and family and that hasn't happened yet.""","""We are deeply concerned about new delays that have prevented their departure,"" says Kerry .

"(CNN) -- Friends have asked Brianne Bricker to be their bridesmaid so many times, that this summer she finally had to say ""no."" It's not that the 24-year-old didn't want to be in her friend's wedding, but after spending more than $5,000 on nine weddings over the last two years, she literally just can't afford one more. ""It's hard, because she's somebody I'd want to have in my wedding,"" Bricker said, referring to the bride she turned down who is a close college friend. But Bricker isn't the only bridesmaid to feel the burden of wedding expenses. After adding up the cost of the dress, accessories, travel expenses, wedding gifts and more, WeddingChannel.com found that it costs about $1,695 to be a bridesmaid. The estimate was based on a 2010 Real Weddings study that surveyed more than 20,000 brides nationwide. The highest expenses include travel to the wedding, shower and bachelorette party, which each can cost an average of $300. Stars talk about ""Bridesmaids"" Many bridesmaids don't realize how quickly the expenses can add up, says Amy Eisinger, associate editor of WeddingChannel.com. ""From the moment they announce the engagement, to the day your friend walks down the isle, if that's a year and a half, you don't realize that you've spent $1,600,"" she said. As the economy struggles out of a slump, the price of weddings -- and the cost of being a bridesmaid -- is starting to rise. ""We saw the cost go down during the recession because brides were incredibly cost conscious in what they were asking their friends to do,"" Eisinger said. Now, brides are asking for more formal weddings with larger price tags. While women want to be in their best friend's wedding, some just can't spend all their savings on the big day. So how do you break it to the bride that you can't be her bridesmaid? ""Be honest up front,"" says Jodi R.R. Smith, author of ""The Etiquette Book,"" which includes advice on everything from the proper music selection to the wording on wedding invitations. ""If you try to be able to do it, then you end up maxing out your credit cards and going into debt,"" Smith said. ""You should never be going into debt for a friend's wedding."" Smith advises women to turn down bridesmaid offers in person, but never during a wedding-related event like the bridal shower. Instead, grab coffee or find a time to talk outside of work. Don't ""throw a fit"" about the expenses, but just tell the truth, Eisinger says. ""You are allowed to say, 'Look, I'm just not going to be able to afford the $200 wedding dress and the trip to Mexico for the bachelorette party and the fact that it's a destination wedding in Key West,' "" she said. Destination weddings and honeymoons . Brides who want their friends to walk down the aisle with them will probably offer to pay for expenses like the dress or plane ticket to the wedding, Smith said. ""If it's a choice between having somebody be in your wedding party or having them all wear designer bridesmaid dresses, I would choose the people and the cheaper bridesmaid dress,"" Smith said. Bridesmaid Christina Barkel was allowed to pick her own dress for a wedding  as long as it was royal blue. After months of scouring sale racks and thrift stores, she found the perfect dress for only $40. Barkel, an AmeriCorps member who earns a small stipend, is paying for only the dress and $450 plane ticket from Michigan to California to be in her friend's wedding in San Diego. Barkel said the bride offered to pay for three of her four nights in a hotel because she understands Barkel can't afford the expense. Knowing what bridesmaids can and can't afford can be a tricky situation for brides. It's not polite to ask directly, so Smith advises brides to give a spreadsheet with an estimated cost of expenses to their bridesmaids. That way, women can see if their bank accounts can handle the final total. More ""Bridesmaids"" coming down the aisles? But like in the movie ""Bridesmaids,"" unexpected surprises like a bachelorette party in Las Vegas do happen. In these cases, bridesmaids shouldn't be shy to offer alternatives. ""Instead of the bachelorette party in Vegas, [if] you're all East Coast people, have it in Atlantic City,"" Smith says. University of Michigan graduate student Katie Okonowski, 23, will be a bridesmaid in her younger sister's wedding next spring. Okonowski said she was thrilled to hear that her sister chose a venue in their hometown of Dearborn, Michigan. ""The fact that it's not out of town, and I don't have to pay for a hotel or travel cost, is really a big cost saver,"" she said. Travel is the biggest expense, but bridesmaids shell out an average of $75 for shoes and another $60 for jewelry, according to the Wedding Channel study. Tack on $100 for manicures, hair and makeup. Celebrity wedding gowns through the decades . Katie Tobin, a 26-year-old student at Loyola University's Law School, is attending nine weddings this summer and is a bridesmaid for two of them. She's having a relative do her hair for her friend's wedding after the previous hair salon bill was twice as much as expected. Tobin said she feels ""a little overwhelmed"" with wedding costs because there are so many at once, and she estimates that she'll spend close to $1,300 as a bridesmaid. While she's using her savings to pay for the dresses and bachelorette parties, she can afford only inexpensive kitchen accessories as wedding gifts. ""I'm still in law school, so luckily, my friends understand I can't do anything too extravagant giftwise,"" she said. Bricker, whose friends compare her to the main character in""27 Dresses,"" says she has had second thoughts about being in some of the weddings in which she wasn't as close to the bride. ""I think you underestimate how much it's going to cost,"" she said with a knowing laugh. ""To be honest, it's probably some of the reason that I'm as poor as I am."" Being a bridesmaid drained my bank account . Tips for bridesmaids on a budget . 1) The dress: If the bride picks a dress that costs $300, don't feel like you don't have any right to speak up. Do a little research, and see if you can find a similar dress that costs less, Eisinger suggests. Or suggest to the bride that she choose a color and you pick your own dress. That way, you can find something more affordable. 2) Party planning: Hold the bridal shower and bachelorette party on the same weekend so you don't have to fly somewhere two separate weekends. 3) Gifts: Consider group gifting when it comes time to buy the gift for the bridal shower and for the wedding. 4) Lodging: If you're going to stay in a hotel room, find out who the other single girls are in the bridal party or ask the bride if she has any other single friends who will be coming. Then find out if you can split a hotel room with another girl so you're cutting back on hotel costs. 5) Balancing the budget: At the very beginning, come up with a total number of how much you want to spend on the wedding, and then keep a running tab somewhere on your computer or your iPhone of how much you're really spending. If the wedding is spread out over the course of a year and a half, that will help you keep your spending more in check.","Bridesmaids spend about $1,695 for dress, travel, gifts and other expenses, website says .

"Something struck Tamerlan Tsarnaev's aunt when her nephew arrived in southern Russia last year. He prayed regularly, she said. He avoided looking women in the eye. His transformation into a devout Muslim was a radical change. Less than a year since Pateimat Suleimanova last saw her nephew, he is dead. The FBI says he and his younger brother were behind the Boston Marathon bombings that killed three people and injured more than 170. Authorities say Tsarnaev died after a gunfight with police early Friday. But the suspects' possible motive remains a mystery.  And a key question has emerged as investigators comb through clues: What did Tsarnaev do during a trip to Russia from January to July of last year? According to family accounts, Tsarnaev visited Makhachkala, where his father lives. After Tsarnaev returned to the United States in mid-July, a video of an Islamic militant known as Abu Dujana was posted and then removed from Tsarnaev's YouTube channel. Suspect posted video of jihadist, analysis shows . Five months after Tsarnaev left Makhachkala, Russian security forces there killed Abu Dujana during a gunbattle that left a home in shambles. It's unclear whether Tsarnaev ever met Abu Dujana, or had any ties with the militant group he led. Information about Tsarnaev's trip to Russia has been hard to come by. But speaking to CNN from Makhachkala on Monday, Suleimanova revealed new details about what Tsarnaev did there, and how his family perceived his behavior. The Dagestan connection . Side trip to Chechnya . Suleimanova said Tsarnaev traveled to Chechnya twice, likely going to see his father's family in Gudermes and Chiriyurt  -- towns less than 200 kilometers (about 125 miles) away that were flashpoints in fighting between Russian forces and Chechan rebels during their longstanding tensions in 1990s. Tsarnaev was born in 1986 in Kyrgyzstan to an ethnically Chechen family, his uncle said last week. His birthplace is in a part of the world that's no stranger to violence or terrorism, and the Tsarnaev family saw that firsthand. The family fled violence in Kyrgyzstan and lived in Chechnya when war broke out there between separatists and Russian forces in 1999, Suleimanova told CNN. But she described her nephew's visit to the region last year as a peaceful trip focused on rebuilding family connections. ""He tried to reestablish family ties. ... He went to see people, people came to see him, and of course, he went to pray,"" she said. During the trip, she said, what surprised her and others in the family was the way Tsarnaev's behavior had changed since he went to the United States in 2003. It had become more conservative. ""They hadn't prayed before they went to America. Nobody taught him,"" Suleimanova said. ""He learned everything himself."" The change was notable, she said. ""At the same time,"" she said, ""we were happy about it, because he didn't start doing drugs or alcohol and adopted the path to Islam."" Tsarnaev's parents weren't as devout, she said. ""And it is very strange to me that it was him who adopted Islam, not his father, not his mother, but himself,"" she said. ""But it's not so strange because nowadays the children study Islam and teach their parents, and that's exactly how it turned out with him."" Tsarnaev's behavior made his beliefs clear, she said. Source: Suspect says brother was brains behind attack . ""You know, he and other men don't even touch other women, I mean, he doesn't speak to them (other women),"" she recalls. ""He could speak to his sisters, his cousins and me, and other women are of no significance to him because it's a sin to even look at other women in the eye."" That faith, Suleimanova said, was one reason she believes there is no way her nephews could be behind the Boston bombings. ""In Islam, killing a non-Muslim is like killing all humanity,"" she said, ""and killing a Muslim is like killing the whole world."" Suleimanova recalled being with Tsarnaev's parents last week as the same grainy pictures of their sons that were broadcast around the world flashed on their television screen. His father, Anzor Tsarnaev, pointed. He was certain the two men were his sons. Their mother, Zubeidat Tsarnaeva, the aunt remembered, grabbed the television. ""It can't be, it can't be happening,"" she screamed. ""I don't believe it. Children are dead!"" Earlier that week, Zubeidat had been worried for her sons after hearing about the explosions. When she asked how they were doing in a phone conversation, the brothers said they loved her and that everything was ""pretty normal,"" Suleimanova said. ""Mommy, we are totally fine,"" they said, according to Suleimanova. ""We miss your warmth and your caress."" Suspect's wife 'very distraught' Russia's fight with Islamic militants . In a building on the other side of the city, the walls are still scarred from a fierce gunbattle between Russian security forces and Islamist militants that erupted last year. Fallen cinder blocks litter the ground inside. Neighbors told CNN that Abu Dujana and the other young men who once lived in the building seemed peaceful and ordinary. But in late December 2012, authorities brought in an armored vehicle to kill Abu Dujana, whose real name was Gadzhimurad Dolgatov. There are no clues in the rubble left behind that offer answers to a troubling question: Why did Tsarnaev's YouTube page link to the rants of the militant who died here? In August 2012, soon after returning from Russia to the United States, Tsarnaev apparently created a YouTube channel with links to a number of videos. Two videos under a category labeled ""Terrorists"" have since been deleted. It's not clear when or by whom. One of those videos showed Abu Dujana, who led a small militant group that had links to the most potent Islamist group in the region. U.S. officials told CNN analyst Tom Fuentes on Sunday they have found no further connection between Tsarnaev and Abu Dujana, but the investigation into his activities overseas continues. In 2011, before his visit to Russia, Moscow asked the FBI to investigate Tamerlan Tsarnaev in the United States, according to the FBI. ""The request stated that it was based on information that he was a follower of radical Islam and a strong believer, and that he had changed drastically since 2010 as he prepared to leave the United States for travel to the country's region to join unspecified underground groups,"" the FBI said in a statement. Some details have also emerged about what Tsarnaev did after he returned from Russia, including a January incident at a mosque in Cambridge, Massachusetts. During a sermon about gaining inspiration from the story of slain civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr., Tsarnaev interrupted the preacher, the Islamic Society of Boston said in a statement Monday. Tsarnaev stood up, shouted at the preacher, accused him of ""contaminating people's mind"" and called him a hypocrite, the society said, citing accounts from congregants. Some members of the congregation shouted back at Tsarnaev, telling him to ""leave now."" Leaders of the mosque later told him he would no longer be welcome at the mosque if he continued to interrupt sermons. At future prayers, he was quiet.

"(CNN) -- Colombian rebels released a top military general and two other hostages Sunday in a move that could allow stalled peace talks to resume. Brig. Gen. Rubén Darío Alzate, who commands a 2,500-soldier counterinsurgency group and previously headed the Colombian army's anti-kidnapping unit, was among the hostages handed over to mediators in a rural area in western Colombia, the International Committee of the Red Cross said. The released hostages are ""in perfect condition,"" Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos said in a Twitter post Sunday. Colombia's Defense Ministry said they were being transported to the country's capital Sunday evening to reunite with their families and undergo medical checkups after 14 days in captivity. Local media reported that Alzate was the highest-ranking officer to be taken prisoner by guerrillas from the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia during the country's bloody, five-decades-old civil war. The high-profile capture two weeks ago sent the peace talks in Havana between the government and the rebels, who are known as the FARC, screeching to a halt. Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos suspended the peace talks, demanded Alzate's release and called on the country's military to investigate why the general had apparently broken protocol by venturing into rebel territory. Alzate was traveling by a boat along a river in an area known to be a hub for drug smugglers and rebels when he, an Army lawyer and a corporal were captured, Colombian government officials said. A second soldier traveling with the group managed to escape and told officials that Alzate and his companions had been in the area to inspect an energy project. But FARC leaders told reporters in Havana earlier this month that no such project exists in that area and that they were baffled by Alzate's presence there. Rebels released Alzate, the corporal and the army lawyer Sunday to representatives of the Cuban and Norwegian governments and the Red Cross. They were transported via helicopter to Medellin, where they were handed over to the Colombian army, the Red Cross said. On Twitter, Colombia's Defense Ministry posted a photo of the three freed hostages meeting with the defense minister and other military leaders. The U.S. government has provided Colombia's military with billions of dollars in training and aid to battle FARC guerrillas, who authorities accuse of massive-scale drug trafficking to finance their insurgency. At the beginning of the peace talks in 2012, FARC leaders said they had released all their prisoners and hostages as a sign of good faith. But President Santos has resisted their offers of a ceasefire, saying a previous armistice allowed rebels to seize large swathes of territory. Santos said in a statement that he would be meeting with his government's negotiators to discuss the terms of their return to Havana. The release of the hostages Sunday, he said, ""contributed to restoring a climate conducive to continuing the talks, demonstrates the maturity of the process and permits us to unite our voice to those of millions of Colombians who express their solidarity with those freed."" The rebels renewed their calls for a ceasefire in a written statement released Sunday, saying the guerrilla group must now ""redesign the rules of the game."" ""It is time for a bilateral ceasefire, an armistice, so that no bellicose event on the battlefield can be used to justify the interruption of such beautiful and historic work as it is to agree on peace for a nation that longs for this destiny,"" the FARC said. After the hostages' release, a Red Cross official said he hoped the peace talks would start up again. ""We hope that the peace talks between the Colombian government and the FARC-EP will resume soon,"" Christoph Harnisch, who heads the Red Cross delegation in Colombia, said in a statement. ""We continue to support this process, with a view to alleviating the suffering of all the victims of this long conflict."" Freed Colombian hostages carry pets tamed in the jungle .

"Tanupriya Khurana watches intently as her sister Bhavna gets a makeover at a designer cosmetics kiosk in the middle of one of Delhi's most popular malls, Select Citywalk. Shades of velvety pink blush roll over Bhavna's olive cheeks. She holds up a mirror and inspects the results. Behind the kiosk, a clothing and lingerie store displays trendy fashions on mannequins with blond hair, blue eyes and milky white complexions. They look nothing like Tanupriya and her sister or the hundreds of other Indians milling about this upscale shopping complex on a Sunday afternoon. Even the advertisements and store posters that use Indian faces promote a look that is unattainable for most Indians: long, silky straight hair; a tall, thin body; and, most importantly, a fair complexion. The most popular Bollywood stars such as Aishwarya Rai -- a former Miss World -- look more white than Indian. ""Being white is the preference,"" says Tanupriya, 23, an insurance brokerage firm employee. ""There's a different psychology here. I think Indian women have problems with acceptance."" ""Gori hai sundar,"" she says. White is beautiful. Khurana says this tongue in cheek. She knows it's racist -- and disagrees with this collective thinking. But she's right. As far back as I can remember, a woman's complexion has been a very big deal in my native land. When I was a child, my aunt forbade me to play outside lest I turn several shades darker in the sun. The same aunt lamented after one of my trips to Iraq that the strong sun had made me ""black."" ""You used to be so pretty,"" she said. In other words: ""You used to be so light-skinned."" Many Indians feel their country's disturbing obsession with fairness has been compounded in recent years with the invasion of European and American retail outlets and widespread access to information via the Internet. The discussion was reignited after Nina Davaluri, a woman of Indian descent, was crowned Miss America. Many here wondered: Could someone as dark complexioned as Davaluri win a pageant in the country of her heritage? Opinion: Miss America, Julie Chen and the beauty of choice . Pratima Singh, the kiosk employee doing the makeover on Tanupriya's sister, says she often has clients who choose foundation or powder that is too light for them. ""They say they want to look like her,"" Singh says pointing to a giant clothing ad featuring a white woman. ""But you can't camouflage what you are."" Khurana agrees. ""That's the saddest thing in our country,"" she says as her sister's face is transformed into Bollywood glamor. ""Looks, color of skin -- we should ignore such things."" Should, yes. But even those here who do not dispute the new Miss America's beauty said this: A pageant or a Bollywood role is one thing, but when it comes down to finding a bride for a beloved son, Davaluri, despite her stunning looks, would be too dark to make the cut. Sure enough, matrimonial ads in India -- arranged marriages are still the way many young people choose to wed -- often read like this: . ""Seeking match for beautiful, tall, fair girl ..."" And those women who are the norm in India -- that is, not light-skinned -- are targeted by a $400 million skin-whitening-cream industry. It began years ago with a product called Fair & Lovely. Former Miss California: How do we teach kids diversity is beautiful? I was first introduced to it through a letter from India 35 years ago. It was from one of my childhood friends in Kolkata. She was getting married and wanted to look her best on her wedding day. Her parents thought they were lucky to have secured her a good husband in an arranged marriage. She was, after all, dark complexioned. She said she had been using Fair & Lovely but wasn't satisfied with the results. She wanted me to bring her something better from America. I've noticed on my visit here that Fair & Lovely is still on the shelves. But women who can afford it have a wide selection of products from which to choose. There is even a vaginal wash that promises freshness, protection and, of course, skin lightening. Some people blame the industry for making the problem worse. But Shivangi Gupta of MidasCare Pharmaceutical, the manufacturer of the vaginal wash, said the company is simply ceding to customer demands. ""We had a very proactive consumer coming in and asking us for this product, and I think it would be very irresponsible of us to not to provide that as a solution,"" Gupta says. In Kolkata, I ventured into a beauty products store that carried a dizzying array of skin creams. Employee Jayasree Sarkar told me the skin-lightening creams were the store's most popular products. It doesn't matter that they don't really make you two shades lighter in a matter of a week. Women keep buying the stuff, believing there might be a chance. Their hope is fueled by Bollywood megastars such as Shah Rukh Khan, a darker-complexioned actor who had been peddling a cream made by Emami called Fair and Handsome. Khan tells Indians that he gained success after using the cream. Pria Warrick, a former Miss India who now runs a finishing school for women in Delhi, says India is still struggling to get over its colonial past. ""We, of course, in India are very obsessed with being very fair. I think it's something the British left us with,"" Warrick says. Warrick tells me she is convinced that India needs someone like Oprah Winfrey to do for Indian women what the star did for black women in America -- to make Indians proud of their culture, their heritage, their looks. She also blames the infiltration of U.S. culture for making Indian society so focused on physical beauty. ""American culture places a lot of importance on looks,"" she says. Indians stand at a crossroads, Warrick says. ""How much do we pick up from the West?"" Documentary brings light to 'Dark Girls' Some Indians are trying to reverse the movement to be fair. Actor Nandita Das has lent her face to the ""Dark is Beautiful"" campaign, trying to foment change. ""The point is do we want to capitalize this prejudice and lack of self worth and further perpetuate it,"" Das says in the campaign, ""or do we want to address it in a way and empower more women and make them feel good in the way they are?"" Back at the Delhi mall, Jai Shukla, 31, says it's a shame Indians are so obsessed with skin tones. ""I think mentally, we are not free,"" he says, admitting that he once tried lightening creams on his own chocolate skin. He says he used to teach Hindi to Westerners at the posh Imperial Hotel in Delhi. Sometimes, the guards assumed he was a laborer. He says he was a victim of profiling because of his dark complexion. He tried skin-lightening creams but gave it all up once he began to gain more confidence in himself. Rajat Tyagi, 28, rattles off a list of actresses he says personify his ideal of beauty: Kate Winslett, Angelina Jolie and Indian actor Katrina Kaif, who is light-skinned. But Tygai goes against the grain. When it comes to marrying someone, he says, he won't care if she is white, brown or black. It's what inside that matters, he says. ""Really?"" I ask him. ""Really,"" he says. I didn't know whether to believe him, especially in the midst of the retail madness of this Delhi mall. His answer is cliche. But I am glad he said it.","Many Indians feel the disturbing obsession with fairness is compounded by Westernization .

"(CNN) -- A dream vacation to most sounded like a nightmare to Julie Evans. In 2006, Evans' husband won an all-expense-paid trip to Hawaii, and scuba diving was one of the included activities. She wanted to go, but not enough to put on a bathing suit. ""It was at that moment that I realized that my weight was preventing me from living,"" Evans said. A stay-at-home mom in Macomb Township, Michigan, 35-year-old Evans had been at a normal body mass index most of her life. But with the birth of first child, she started adding weight to her 5-foot-6 frame. Less than two years after the first, she was pregnant with her second child. Evans said her weight gain was a combination of ""pregnancy weight, a bit of depression and a whole lot of negative self-esteem."" During the pregnancy, her husband switched jobs, and was living in New York for a month during his training. After that, he began traveling frequently. ""I was at home with two kids under the age of 2,"" Evans said. ""I felt alone."" The weight kept piling on. At her heaviest, she says she was up to 287 pounds and wearing a size 24. When she returned home from Hawaii, she was ready to lose weight, but wasn't yet sure where to start. Thinking her way thin . Her mother had been trying a different approach than most: ""hypnosis gastric bypass"" with Florida-based certified hypnotist, Rena Greenberg. Evans saw the results her mother was getting, and in late 2007, she scheduled an appointment with Greenberg. Gastric bypass surgery, sometimes called bariatric surgery, divides the stomach into a small upper pouch and a larger pouch that's unused, physically shrinking the stomach's capacity to hold food. The results are that patients aren't able to eat as much, due to their smaller stomachs. Hypnosis gastric bypass is exactly what its name implies. A hypnotist walks patients through a simulated version of gastric bypass surgery -- from meeting the doctor, nurse and anesthesiologist to describing the surgical procedure to leaving the hospital. After hypnosis, Greenberg said, the mind believes the stomach is smaller, decreasing appetite and shrinking the physical capacity for food. There are also other types of weight loss hypnosis -- some focus on retraining the brain to simply eat healthier or less. Because hypnosis isn't a mainstream weight loss method, there are limited studies about its effectiveness. In one 1996 meta-analysis that looked at six previous studies, researchers found participants who used hypnosis averaged a 15-pound weight loss at the end of treatment, compared to the control group who lost an average of 6 pounds without hypnosis. Study author Irving Kirsch noted that the studies he compared varied in the length of treatment time, ranging from two months to two years. Kirsch found a connection between longer treatment time and results, suggesting that the impact of hypnosis increases with time, and may be a useful tool for weight loss maintenance. A self-described sugar and carb addict, Greenberg found herself very ill at age 26. ""I needed a pacemaker, and ... I saw an opportunity to change my lifestyle."" She developed the hypnosis program after her health scare in 1990, and after using it herself, began passing it along to her patients. ""It's about changing the way you think about food subconsciously,"" Greenberg said. ""And it's great for people who hate dieting, since they don't feel like they're giving up food."" Evans had three private sessions with Rena for three days in a row, and took home several CDs. An immediate change . After her first session, Evans said she started craving spinach. By the next day, she said she was eating a quarter of what she had before. ""I physically couldn't eat as much as I had been, and I only wanted really healthy things,"" she said. ""I haven't had a soda since that day, whereas before, it was every day."" The weight came off steadily at the beginning. But as it does for many people, the losses eventually began to slow. After she lost 100 pounds, Evans started exercising in order to reach her goal. ""I love it now, but the first time actually going to the gym was the hardest,"" she said. ""I felt like I was going into a shark tank."" It took two years to reach her goal of 150 pounds, losing almost half of her body weight. Evans has since maintained her weight for over three years. She does a lot of weight training and said she tries not to weigh herself, since muscle weighs more than fat. Instead, she prefers to say that she wears a size 6, and has done so for years. Although gastric bypass hypnosis may help some people lose weight, experts say there are other benefits gained from the real surgery besides a smaller stomach size. ""There are changes in many gut and brain hormones after bypass surgery and other operations for weight loss,"" said Dr. Ann M. Rogers, director of Penn State Hershey's Surgical Weight Loss Program. ""This is why it's becoming more common to call this 'metabolic surgery' than 'bariatric surgery.' "" Rogers said that the hunger hormone, ghrelin, drops post-surgery, helping patients to feel less hungry and eat less. There are also hormonal changes that improve the way the body processes sugars and fats, which can reduce the risk of diabetes and lower cholesterol. Although Rogers has read about people who've been able to lose weight through hypnosis, she doesn't think it's for everyone. ""I don't think as many people will have success with this as with metabolic surgery,"" she said. ""Many people are able to lose weight through diet and exercise, but it's keeping the weight off long-term that's the challenge."" Three years of success . But for Evans, hypnosis worked and she's beaten the odds by keeping the weight off. She doesn't listen to Greenberg's CDs every day anymore but uses them on an ""as needed basis."" Her husband, Brian Evans, said that his wife's determination to eat well and exercise daily has been a positive influence on the rest of the family. ""I certainly live a more healthy and active life than I did before."" ""She has proven to (our children) that it is possible to overcome obstacles, regardless of how imposing they might seem,"" he said. ""You have to work hard for the things you want to achieve."" Although Evans still hasn't gone scuba diving, she said she's ready and waiting for the chance to experience what she missed when her weight was holding her back.","Julie Evans lost 140 pounds after having gastric bypass surgery hypnosis .

"(CNN)Uruguay's politicians who led the charge to legalize marijuana and same-sex marriage appeared to win another ringing endorsement from voters in the South American country Sunday. The country's electoral court announced that Tabaré Vazquez of the left-wing Broad Front coalition won the presidential runoff with about 53% of the votes. Candidate Luis Lacalle Pou of the conservative National Party told supporters Sunday evening that he had conceded to Vazquez and wished him well, as exit polls predicted defeat. He garnered about 40% of the vote. Vazquez's victory gives Uruguay a third consecutive five-year term with a leftist leader at the helm. President Jose ""Pepe"" Mujica -- a former Marxist guerrilla who donates the majority of his salary, drives a 1987 Volkswagen Beetle and sells flowers with his wife at their home -- leaves office next year. Vazquez, a 74-year-old oncologist, was Uruguay's President from 2005 to 2010. ""Uruguayans again have said 'yes,' yes to more freedoms and more rights, better democracy and better citizenship,"" he said in a televised speech Sunday. Under Mujica's leadership, the Broad Front has pushed through reforms legalizing abortion, same-sex marriage and marijuana -- major policy shifts in a region once defined by conservative policies influenced by the Roman Catholic Church. The changes have given Uruguay, formerly a military dictatorship, a reputation in Latin America as a leading nation for liberal social policies. And that approach isn't likely to change, if Vazquez's ""Uruguay doesn't stop"" campaign slogan is any indication. This year the South American nation became the first in the world to have a system regulating the legal production, sale and consumption of marijuana. Lacalle had vowed to repeal some parts of the new law if he were elected. Vazquez, a doctor who crusaded against tobacco during his first term as President, has expressed some concerns about the new marijuana law, but said he plans to enforce it. Still, Uruguay's El Pais newspaper recently reported that he hasn't ruled out the possibility of modifying it. ""There will be a strict and very close evaluation about the impact that this law has on society. We are going to analyze it very carefully. And if at any moment we see that it does not work, we will not hesitate for a moment in making the necessary corrections,"" he said, according to El Pais. CNN en Español's Jose Manuel Rodriguez and Dario Klein contributed to this report.","Tabaré Vazquez wins Uruguay's presidential vote .

"As protesters shut down streets around Capitol Hill on Sunday morning, local and national leaders sounded off on developments in Ferguson, Missouri, and speculation over whether President Barack Obama would make a visit to the area. Gov. Deval Patrick, D-Massachusetts, suggested that Obama would like to visit Ferguson. ""I think he wants to go,"" Patrick said on NBC's ""Meet the Press"" on Sunday. ""And that's not because I know that. I just sense that knowing the man."" Following the news last week that Officer Darren Wilson would not be indicted, Obama made an address to the country calling for Americans to accept the decision and not to react with violence. However, he also addressed the frustrations of many in Ferguson and across the country. ""The fact is, in too many parts of this country, a deep distrust exists between law enforcement and communities of color.  Some of this is the result of the legacy of racial discrimination in this country.  And this is tragic, because nobody needs good policing more than poor communities with higher crime rates."" The President also announced that he had instructed Attorney General Eric Holder to work with cities to build better relations between communities and law enforcement. The first meeting will occur Monday in Atlanta, where Holder will hold a roundtable discussion with law enforcement, local officials, community leaders, student leaders and faith leaders on race relations and policing in minority communities. Following the meeting, Holder will speak at Atlanta's Ebenezer Baptist Church, where Martin Luther King Jr. once preached. However it's unclear whether Holder or Obama will visit Ferguson. Patrick said it isn't surprising that some are calling for a visit from the President. He said that as an African-American governor, constituents sometimes looked to him on matters of race, not just their local leaders. ""The expectations of me by virtue of being a black elected official were different, and I had to learn that."" Although discussion over the issue has been rampant since the killing of Michael Brown in early August, there is still much disagreement over what changes would be effective in addressing tensions between law enforcement and the communities they police. Wilson submitted his resignation from the Ferguson Police Department on Saturday, but the underlying issues revealed by the incident and response within the community are far from resolved. New York City is famous for its diversity as well as varied history with policing and violence. On Sunday, former New York Police Commissioner Ray Kelly offered his thoughts on what needs to change and called on the federal government to invest in diversifying law enforcement. ""You can't have a city that's two thirds African-American policed by a department of 53 police officers where only three of them are a minority. It makes no sense,"" said Kelly on ABC's ""The Week."" ""A department that reflects the city or the municipality that it serves is much easier to police. It's smarter policing to have that type of a relationship."" Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, famous for cracking down on violence with policies such as ""stop-and-frisk,"" said better training for law enforcement is a key part of the solution. However, he also said that more violence occurs in black communitiesm, warranting an increased police presence. ""I think just as much if not more responsibility is on the black community to reduce the reason why the police officers are assigned in such large numbers to the black community,"" Giulani said of ""Fox News Sunday."" ""Train the police and make them better, I tried it hard. We have a diverse police department in New York. You got to work on the other side of it, too. This is not a one-sided story, and it is presented always as a one-sided story."" However, National Urban League President Marc Morial pushed back on Giuliani's comments. As mayor of New Orleans, Morial said he focused on encouraging strong relationships between local communities and law enforcement -- not only reducing tensions, but preventing crimes. ""I think it's better, if you will, to embrace a proactive, and this is the term, proactive policing system where police officers are out on the beat, where they're building relationships with people in the community. Because after all, the way you bring down crime in a community is not simply by making arrest, but by preventing crime from occurring.""","Local and national leaders address whether President Obama should go to Ferguson .

"Outgoing Democratic Gov. Deval Patrick of Massachusetts says President Barack Obama's failure to communicate a clear, concise message leading up to the 2014 midterm elections was largely what led the Democratic party's demise. ""I think it was a huge mistake,"" Patrick said Sunday on NBC's ""Meet the Press."" ""One problem the President has is he doesn't tell the story well or regularly,"" he said. ""When Democrats ... grow a backbone and stand up for what it is we believe, we win."" RELATED: Begala: Dem 2016 bench is Clinton or zip . In light of the midterm sweep, Obama himself admitted he has not always been the most proactive communicator-in-chief. Citing a long list of the Obama's accomplishments, the two-term governor expanded on that point, arguing the President should have made a greater effort to highlight his and his party's successes ahead of the election. ""You know the importance of repetition is something I had to learn,"" Patrick said. ""It's not to say that everything has been solved, we have reached the Promised Land. But we are better off than we were."" But while Patrick blamed the President for his party's losses nationally, the Massachusetts chief executive himself shirked responsibility for his own state's failure to elect Democrats. ""I wasn't on the ballot,"" Patrick said. ""I ran against the same -- against the (Republican Governor-elect Charlie Baker) four years ago. We had a different outcome then. We had a good candidate who got better as she came closer to Election Day. Of course, (Democrat Martha Coakley) was outspent 9- or 10-to-1."" Asked if he felt any responsibility for her defeat, Patrick said he was ""sorry for that"" but that ""the outcomes of elections depend on the candidates, not the folks on the sidelines."" READ: Hillary Clinton could end up alone in Iowa​ . Looking to the next election, Patrick had lovely things to say about fellow Democrat Hillary Clinton, but he admitted the thought of her as the inevitable Democratic candidate is bad for the party -- a point he has been stressing for months. ""I think Hillary Clinton -- Secretary Clinton -- has been an extraordinary public servant and would be a terrific candidate for president,"" Patrick said. ""But I think that the narrative that it's inevitable is off putting to regular voters."" ""I don't mean that as a criticism of her. I just think that people read inevitability as entitlement. The American people want and ought to want their candidates to sweat for the job -- to actually make a case for why they are the right person at the right time.""​ . Reflecting on his own political future, the outgoing governor says he's thought about a 2016 run, but has ruled it out. ""I have thought about it,"" Patrick admitted. But, he added, ""I can't get ready for 2016."" ""I didn't run for the job (as governor) to get another job, just to do this job.""","Outgoing Massachusetts Gov.

"For the first time since the Taliban shot her five months ago, Pakistani teenager Malala Yousafzai has done what made her a target of the would-be assassins: She's gone to school. The 15-year-old on Tuesday attended Edgbaston High School in Birmingham, England, the city in which doctors treated her after she received initial care in Pakistan, a public relations agency working with her announced. It was her first day at school since the Taliban shot her in the head in October for campaigning for girls' education. ""I am excited that today I have achieved my dream of going back to school,"" Malala said, according to a release from her representatives. ""I want all girls in the world to have this basic opportunity. Teen shot for her advocacy is 'the daughter of the whole world,' dad says . ""I miss my classmates from Pakistan very much, but I am looking forward to meeting my teachers and making new friends here in Birmingham."" On October 9, the teenager was riding home in a school van in the Swat Valley, a Taliban stronghold in Pakistan, when masked men stopped the vehicle. They demanded that the other girls identify Malala, and when they did, the men shot Malala in the head and neck. The gunmen also shot another girl, wounding her.

She is continuing rehabilitation at her family's temporary home in Birmingham and is to visit the hospital occasionally for outpatient appointments. Malala's journey from near death to recovery . Her story moved Pakistan to vow that it would more vigorously fight for girls' rights and against the Taliban. Malala gained international attention three years before she was shot, as a campaigner for girls' education in Pakistan. In 2009, she wrote a blog published by the BBC about how she wanted to go to school but was afraid. ""The Taliban have repeatedly targeted schools in Swat,"" she wrote. About that time, the Taliban issued a formal edict, which covered her home in the Swat Valley, banning all girls from schools. On the blog, Malala praised her father, who was operating one of the few schools that would go on to defy that order.  She started giving interviews with news outlets, including CNN. ""I have the right of education,"" she said in a 2011 interview with CNN. ""I have the right to play. I have the right to sing. I have the right to talk. I have the right to go to market.

"(CNN) -- Slovak voters have dumped their government, prompting one nationalist firebrand to warn that the country would now be run by ""homosexuals and Hungarians,"" the Slovak news agency TASR reported Sunday. Slovakia's governing center-left Smer-SD party came first in parliamentary elections, but center-right parties captured more seats overall and look more likely to be able to form the next government, TASR said, citing unofficial results. Prime Minister Robert Fico's party actually increased its share of the vote and will have the largest number of seats in parliament by far, but will fall short of an overall majority. A potential coalition of four center-right parties looks set to control 79 seats in the 150-seat legislature. Former Prime Minister Mikulas Dzurinda's SKDU-DS party lost three seats, but Dzurinda could return to power because his party is the biggest of the four possible coalition parties. Fico said he was willing to try to form or government or to lead the opposition, TASR reported. Jan Slota, the firebrand leader of the Slovak National Party, was less sanguine about the results. ""Homosexuals and Hungarians will begin to rule in this state, so thank you very much,"" Slota said as exit polls showed his party losing power, according to TASR. ""I'm feeling like crying because of Slovaks. Let's wait for the (official) results ... you can see, I'm not broken, I'm only sad about Slovaks,"" said Slota, adding: ""We'll all cry tears of blood."" An ethnic Hungarian party, Most-Hid, looks set to win 14 seats and be part of the new government. Slovakia has a large ethnic Hungarian minority. The mountainous Central European country was part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire until World War I. Slota's party has been in a governing coalition with Fico's Smer-SD and the nationalist party of another former prime minister, Vladimir Meciar, since 2006. Meciar's party failed to secure at least 5 percent of votes Saturday, so they will not have any seats in the new parliament, TASR reported.","Center-left prime minister's party wins most votes, but no majority .

"Michael Brown's mother says hearing that a grand jury had decided not to indict the officer who killed her son felt like getting shot. ""We heard this and it was just like, like I had been shot. Like you shoot me now -- just no respect, no sympathy, nothing,"" Lesley McSpadden told CNN's Sunny Hostin on Wednesday. ""This could be your child. This could be anybody's child."" A New York Times video captured the moments after McSpadden heard about the decision not to indict Darren Wilson, the white officer who killed her son, Michael Brown, a black teen. She stood with protesters outside the Ferguson police department, sobbing uncontrollably. McSpadden's husband, her son's stepfather, wrapped her in his arms before turning to the crowd, screaming: ""Burn this bitch down."" ""He just spoke out of anger. It's one thing to speak and it's a different thing to act. He did not act. He just spoke out of anger,"" McSpadden said about her husband, Louis Head. ""When you're that hurt and the system has did you this wrong, you may say some things as well. We've all spoke out of anger before,"" she told CNN. Both McSpadden and Brown's father, Michael Brown Sr., sat down with Hostin. Neither believes Wilson's version of events, saying their son would never have taunted the officer, nor reached for his weapon. They remembered their son as humble, silly and soft spoken. He could fix almost anything and loved animals, his siblings and being a grandson. ""He was different, but he still was like any other teenager -- wanted to explore different things, do different things, be around different people,"" McSpadden said. ""He's young. He's growing up. He's finding himself."" 'He's a murderer' Brown's father didn't mince words when he spoke about Wilson: ""He's a murderer."" ""He understood his actions. He understood exactly what he was doing. You know, he didn't have a second thought, a pushback thought, or nothing. He was intending to kill someone. That's how I look at it,"" Brown said. ""He was going to kill someone at that point."" Earlier, he'd said the grand jury's decision changed his view of America. ""I was upset. I didn't understand,"" Brown said in a conversation with the Rev. Al Sharpton on Tuesday on MSNBC. ""It just let me know that where we live is not what we thought, or what I thought. It's what people have been saying all the time, for a nice little minute: that this was a racist state."" Sharpton accused Prosecutor Robert McCulloch of trying to disparage Michael Brown Jr. He asked Michael Brown Sr. how he felt about the prosecutor attacking ""the character of the victim."" ""They crucified his character,"" Brown said. In a news conference Monday night announcing the grand jury's decision, McCulloch extended his ""deepest sympathies"" to the Brown family and referred to the ""tragic death."" He said the grand jury's decision was based on evidence and facts, some of which contradicted people who said they witnessed Officer Darren Wilson shooting Michael Brown Jr. McCulloch had long promised a fair and complete presentation. ""We will be presenting absolutely everything to this grand jury,"" he told a radio program in August. ""Every statement that a witness made, every witness, every photograph, every piece of physical evidence. Absolutely nothing will be left out."" Transcript of prosecutor's news conference . Documents released by the prosecutor's office show that witnesses gave differing accounts. Should a special prosecutor have been appointed? Experts disagree over whether McCulloch should have stepped aside and let a special prosecutor handle the case. His father, a police officer, was killed on the job by an African-American man in 1964, when McCulloch was 12. HLN legal analyst Joey Jackson said Wednesday that while there can be discussions about the possibility of bias as a result of his father's death, there is a more fundamental reason he should not have taken the case: the close relationship prosecutors often have with their local police. ""You rely upon the police every day"" as a prosecutor, Jackson said on CNN's ""New Day."" ""You give them your support, your resources. They give those resources back to you."" CNN legal analyst Paul Callan disagreed with the reasoning. A prosecutor should not be disqualified ""because he's worked with the cops closely in the past. I would say, 'You know something? He's a guy with integrity, I'll trust his investigation.'"" ""I think the grand jury reached the right result on the facts of this case,"" Callan said. Still, ""you have to have public confidence in the result."" If the public did not have faith in McCulloch because of his father's killing, then ""maybe because of the level of public distrust, we should have had a special prosecutor,"" Callan said.

"(CNN) -- Mexico's international image may be taking hits because of the violence produced by drug cartels, but it hasn't hurt its tourism industry, officials say. International tourism to Mexico has increased 2.1% in the first five months of 2011 compared to 2010, and it remains the top destination for Americans traveling abroad. Statistics from the U.S. Department of Commerce show that fewer Americans are traveling abroad, but a bigger percentage of those who do are going to Mexico. Mexico also reported double-digit increases in the percentage of visitors from Russia, Brazil and China, among others. ""The data doesn't lie,"" Mexico's deputy secretary for tourism, Ricardo Anaya, told CNN. ""Tourists keep choosing Mexico."" The unrelenting battles between rival drug cartels and police and cartels have provided nearly unlimited fodder for those who write off Mexico as a dangerous destination. The truth, Anaya said, is that the violence is limited to certain geographic areas that can be avoided by tourists. The border area, for example, where much violence has been recorded, is 1,200 miles from the resort town of Cancun -- that's like avoiding travel to Houston because of problems in New York, he said. According to surveys by Mexican tourism authorities, 98% of those who do visit Mexico say they will come back, and 99% recommend it to others. Opinion: Why you should go to Mexico . Much of the growth has been fueled by new programs to incentivize tourists from emerging economies, such as the so-called BRIC countries -- Brazil, Russia, India and China. For starters, Mexico began allowing holders of U.S. visas to enter Mexico, opening up the possibility of tourists to the United States extending their trips south of the border. Also, Brazilians, Russians and Ukrainian visitors can gain travel permission to Mexico on the Internet, with no need for a visa. Finally, for travelers from other countries, visas to Mexico in many cases can be obtained through a travel agent, erasing the need for trips to embassies. In 2011 to date, Mexico has seen a 40.9% increase in Brazilian tourists, a 58.1% increase from Russia and 32.8% increase from China, according to Mexico's tourism ministry. For U.S. travelers specifically, the Commerce Department's most recent data -- for 2009 -- shows that 31.7% of all U.S. international tourists go to Mexico. From 2002 to 2009, while U.S. tourism to Canada fell by more than 27%, tourism to Mexico from the U.S. increased by 5.1%. This happened even though the overall number of Americans traveling abroad decreased, from a peak of 64 million in 2007 to 61.4 million in 2009. When Kendra Young, a high school teacher in Texas, told her friends that she and her husband's family were going to Cozumel for a yearly retreat, she was met with skepticism. Are you worried, they would ask? Are you still going? ""I think people see all of Mexico as one entity,"" she told CNN. It was the third straight year that she traveled to the same resort, and security was not a concern for her. Young is pregnant, and she was more worried about food-borne or water-borne illness. She was aware of several State Department travel warnings to Mexico's cartel hot spots, but she also knew that the area she was traveling to was not affected. Her group planned to stay on the resort, where they felt safest, but on the advice of resort staff they trusted from the previous trips, they ventured into the city without worries. ""Unfortunately, there are the headline-grabbing things -- the drugs, the violence -- but I don't think that's indicative of what's happening in the entire country,"" Young said. Anaya pointed out that Americans are not unaware of the violence -- 80% of Americans who travel to Mexico go to six places, none of which have had travel alerts. The destinations are Cozumel, Riviera Maya, Cancun, Puerto Vallarta/Nuevo Vallarta, Mexico City and Los Cabos, he said. Some beach destinations, like Acapulco, have been the scene of some of the drug cartel bloodshed, but still managed to increase its tourism 3% in the first five months of 2011 compared to last year, thanks to national, rather than international, tourism. But some pitfalls of tourism in Mexico persist. Tucson, Arizona, resident Denise Hermosillo and a couple of friends made the six-hour trek last week from her home to Bahia de Kino in the state of Sonora, Mexico. This area is not under a travel warning, but is not among the top destinations for American tourists. ""I was scared out of my mind to go there,"" Hermosillo said. Friends of hers who are in the military are not allowed to cross the border and urged her not to do the same. But she wanted to go to the beach to write for a book she is working on, and Bahia de Kino is the closest one. On the first day of her vacation, her group was pulled over by a police officer, who promptly asked for $100 in exchange to letting them go. In the moment she was frightened, all those stories about bloody ends in Mexico rushing to her mind. But she negotiated the bribe down to $20 and her group was allowed to continue on their journey. ""It was pretty pathetic, I thought. What are you going to do with 20 bucks?"" she said. Still, she was unable to relax during her vacation. Would she go back? She doesn't know. Would she recommend Mexico to a friend? Maybe, but only if you are traveling with someone who could act as a guide.","Mexico remains the No. 1 destination for Americans traveling abroad .

"(CNN)Two worlds. Two identities and the ever-present, very real risk of death. That was the life of Morten Storm, a radical Islamist turned double agent, who's now lifting the lid on some of the world's best-kept secrets. His life is the stuff of spy novels, and he talks about it in his book: ""Agent Storm: My Life Inside al Qaeda and the CIA,"" co-authored by CNN terrorism analyst Paul Cruickshank and Tim Lister. Both men are CNN contributors. He also recently sat down with CNN Senior International Correspondent Nic Robertson. ""I had these different names. I had different personalities,"" Storm said. ""I was Morten Storm, Murad Storm, Abu Osama, Abu Mujahid."" He was so trusted by senior al Qaeda leaders he once fixed one up with a European wife, all the while -- Storm claims -- working for Western intelligence agencies. ""For half a decade, I moved back and forth between two worlds and two identities -- when one misplaced sentence could have cost me my life,"" he writes in the book. ""Traveling between atheism and hardline Islam, English and Arabic."" ""It's some kind of schizophrenic lifestyle,"" he said. Excerpt: Finding a wife for Anwar al-Awlaki . Growing up . Storm's remarkable journey began rather unremarkably in Denmark, in a town called Korsor. It's a place with plenty of places for a young boy to play and Storm remembers, fondly, his time in the forest and on the beach. He also remembers struggling with the absence of his father. Storm started getting into trouble early. As a teen, he committed armed robbery and got into fighting, feeding off the adrenaline of both. ""Boxing for me was a way of getting out my aggressions,"" said Storm, who didn't limit his fights to the ring. By his 18th birthday, he'd landed himself in jail. After he got out, Storm joined the Bandidos, a biker gang, working as its muscle. His life was going nowhere good -- and fast. Finding 'truth' Storm's trajectory changed after he found a book on the life of the Prophet Mohammed in the tiny religion section at the Korsor library. ""It changed me. It spoke to me, that book. This is the truth,"" he said. ""I found the truth."" Storm became Murad Storm and traveled to Yemen, where he learned Arabic and a strict uncompromising interpretation of Islam. He named his son after Osama bin Laden. Storm dove head first into the world of jihad, traveling with Danish journalist Nagieb Khaja, who wanted to shoot a film about mujahedeen in Yemen. While there, Storm befriended Yemeni-American cleric Anwar al-Awlaki, who was poised to become a key member of al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula and a major U.S. target. ""They were joking, sitting and telling stories -- joking about some of the stuff that they missed in the Western countries,"" Khaja said about Storm and al-Awlaki. ""They talked a lot about jihad, for example. And again, Storm was an extreme guy. Storm was being talked down by Anwar al-Awlaki,"" Khaja said. ""Al-Awlaki was telling Storm to chill out."" Undeterred, Storm decided to join jihadists in Somalia, but, at the last minute, he got a call telling him not to come. The situation on the ground had grown too dangerous. ""I'm so deeply disappointed, and devastated,"" Storm told CNN. ""I felt betrayed."" And in his disappointment, doubt began to grow. Switching sides . Sitting in front of a laptop, Storm typed in some of his concerns. ""I hit the 'enter' and I saw plenty of websites talking about contradictions in the Quran,"" he said. ""It took some time to research them, but once I concluded that they were genuinely contradictions, that's when it wiped totally away my faith,"" Storm said. ""That's when I stopped being a Muslim in my heart -- in my belief."" He got in touch with Danish intelligence agents and told them he wanted a new career. No longer a Muslim, Storm said he wanted to help fight the war on terror. Agents wasted no time putting him to work, making him an agent in demand. His successes, Storm says, soon attracted the attention of the CIA. Hans Jorgen Bonnichesen is the former head of the Danish intelligence agency, known as PET. ""There's no doubt that he was a very valuable agent and has access to some of the sources they really want to get access to,"" he said. A Dane who looks every inch like his Viking ancestors, Storm was exactly what the intelligence community was looking for at the time -- a double agent with an al Qaeda Rolodex to match. The CIA denied repeated requests for comment on Storm's story. Likewise, officials in Denmark have never confirmed or denied his claims. ""By almost sheer luck to some extent that he had been to the many places; he had met all the right people,"" Magnus Ranstorp, one of Scandinavia's top counterterrorism experts, said about Storm. ""I don't think that there are many people like him that have all those different dimensions. He was the real deal,"" Ranstorp said. Playing matchmaker . Storm's authenticity was tested by both sides when al-Awlaki asked him to find a European blonde to be his third wife. His search led to Irena Horak, from Croatia, a recent convert to Islam who called herself Aminah. The plan was a basic honey trap. The blonde was to be bait -- an unsuspecting sacrificial lamb, to lure and kill a lustful al Qaeda leader. Through Storm, al-Awlaki and Aminah exchange encrypted emails and swapped videos. They agreed to marry. For his troubles, Storm says he was promised and received $250,000 when Aminah crossed into Yemen, unknowingly carrying a tracking device hidden inside of a suitcase. He later got an email from al-Awlaki, who wrote that he had married Aminah and that she was better than he had hoped. However, Storm also got an email from Aminah. She wrote that al-Awlaki had told her to dump the suitcase before they met. She had left both it and the tracking device behind. Storm says his CIA handlers were furious: ""The Americans refused to speak to me for six months."" But, Storm says, they came around. Hunting for any leads on al Qaeda, Storm says, the CIA continued to seek out his help, promising as much as $5 million for information leading to the capture or death of al-Awlaki. Going public . Al-Awlaki was eventually tracked down and killed in a U.S. drone strike in 2011. His wife, Aminah, reached out to Storm via email and told him that she offered to become a suicide bomber but had been rebuffed.  CNN tried to reach Aminah through her family, but they would not talk to us. Also, a European counterterrorism official tells CNN that a threat bulletin had been issued at the time, warning that Aminah could be a danger. But Storm insists it was his work that finally found al-Alwaki. But in a conversation taped by Storm at a hotel that same year, an American insisted that a separate stream of intelligence had led to the terror leader. The bottom line: Storm was not going to be paid the $5 million he felt he was owed. His relationship with his handlers deteriorated and, Storm says, he eventually stopped working for the CIA and the Danish intelligence agency PET. The latter tried to buy his silence after it learned he was considering going public with his story. Storm claims the Danish intelligence agency offered payments totaling 1.5m Danish krone ($260,000) over five years. He told the Danish newspaper Jyllands-Posten that PET had offered him the money tax-free. But he said he rejected the deal because PET had broken a series of promises to him, including providing permanent residence status in Denmark for his foreign wife. After so many years playing so many different parts, Storm's toughest role may lie ahead: staying alive. He is in hiding after several death threats from militant Islamists who were once his comrades. The threat was made abundantly clear last year when ISIS fighters in Syria issued a video in which they shot at a picture of him attached to a wall. ""Either they will slice your throat, behead you, or they shoot you and hang you up and crucify you,"" Storm said about his time as a spy. ""I would get executed.""","Morten Storm was a radical Islamist turned double agent .

"A Texas judge denied the appeal of fundamentalist sect leader Warren Jeffs on Thursday, the same day  a jury considered testimony to determine how to sentence a key figure in his church after his own bigamy conviction. The leader of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Jeffs is serving a life-plus-20-year term in Texas for sexual assault. He was convicted in August of the aggravated sexual assaults of a 12-year-old girl and a 15-year-old girl, who Jeffs had claimed were his ""spiritual wives."" On Thursday, Chief Justice J. Woodfin Jones of Texas' Third District Court of Appeals ruled against Jeffs' appeal of that conviction. In his ruling, Jones noted Jeffs, who represented himself during part of his trial, missed several deadlines related to his appeal. Specifically, he did not file ""a written designation specifying the matters to be included in the clerk's record nor (make) arrangements for payment of the record with the clerk's office."" ""We informed Jeffs that his appeal may be dismissed for want of prosecution if he did not make arrangements for payment of the record and submit a status report regarding this appeal on or before January 23, 2012,"" Jones wrote. ""To date, Jeffs has not responded."" The 10,000-member church that Jeffs heads is a breakaway Mormon sect that openly practices polygamy in the twin border towns of Hildale, Utah, and Colorado City, Arizona, as well as on its Yearning for Zion ranch near Eldorado, Texas. The mainstream Mormon church renounced polygamy more than a century ago. Many sect members have disavowed Jeffs in light of his criminal convictions, while others are defending him and calling his conviction on sexual assault charges an act of persecution. Meanwhile, the man who temporarily replaced Jeffs as business head of the church, Wendell Nielsen,  was in a Midland, Texas, court on Thursday for the punishment phase of his own trial. Nielsen was convicted Wednesday on three counts of bigamy, according to Lauren Bean, a spokeswoman for Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott. ""It's a fabulous win for the victims of polygamy that he was convicted on these charges,"" Flora Jessop, who fled Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints as a teenager, told HLN's Dr. Drew Pinsky. Testimony was offered, but there was no sentence decided upon by late Thursday afternoon, Bean said. While awaiting trial in February 2011, Jeffs regained control of the sect and ousted at least 45 high-ranking members considered a threat to his leadership, two well-placed sources told CNN. In that reshuffling, Nielsen was replaced as the church's business figure as Jeffs had signed documents retaking control, according to the sources.","A woman who fled calls Nielsen's conviction ""a fabulous win for the victims of polygamy""

"Ever feel overwhelmed by worries? Do you find yourself dwelling on concerns big (is my job safe?) and small (that darn clogged sink!)? It's official: You're human and living in the United States. Anxiety levels in this country are the highest they've been in seven decades, surveys show. Not surprisingly, money and work woes top most people's freak-out lists (thank you, lingering recession). All that e-mailing, texting, and tweeting aren't helping; social technology has reduced actual face time (a known stress reliever) and made us compulsively available to everyone at all times. Women suffer most -- we're twice as likely as men to be diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder, which involves excessive worry about a wide range of things (and requires medical attention). ""Women are more likely to feel responsible for taking care of others' well-being,"" says Robert Leahy, director of the American Institute for Cognitive Therapy and author of ""The Worry Cure: Seven Steps to Stop Worry from Stopping You."" And in this you-can-do-it! era, some of us think we can power through anxiety, which only exacerbates the problem. Chronic stress has been linked to weight gain, depression, and even cancer.

Health.com: 7 steps to instant calm . What is CBT, anyway? CBT centers on the idea that we can free ourselves from a lot of angst by becoming aware of our distorted view of situations, particularly stressful ones, and adjusting our behaviors accordingly. A 2012 review concluded that CBT can enlarge the prefrontal cortex -- the part of the brain associated with weighing thoughts and making decisions -- and reduce the size of the amygdala, the region associated with stress and fear. In another study of patients with social phobia that compared the effects of CBT and the antidepressant citalopram, both treatments triggered changes in the parts of the brain that help us process, and act upon, fears. ""Our brains are constantly being shaped, most often unwittingly,"" says Richard Davidson, director of the Lab for Affective Neuroscience at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. ""But there are things we can do to purposefully shape them and reduce anxiety."" You can try CBT on your own with the exercises that follow, or, for a more in-depth experience, find a therapist who specializes in it.

"(The Frisky) -- Megin and I first met as mid-level slaves to the fashion industry eight years ago. I recognized a kindred spirit the minute I caught her screaming harsh obscenities at her computer. We've been through boyfriend breakups, apartment break-ins, and career changes. So when she asked me to be a bridesmaid, I jumped at the chance to stand by her side and watch her start a new life with the man she loved. Of course, I wanted to support her in any way possible on her big day; I just didn't realize how much it would cost me! The Frisky: 15 lies we need to stop telling each other . The bachelorette party was my first indication of the financial obligation I agreed to. My plane ticket from New York to Miami: $400. Hotel on South Beach: $300. Dinner and drag show: $150. Drinks at the bar: $200. Bachelorette party in Miami: unfortunately, NOT priceless. In addition to the bachelorette party, I spent a total of $1,500 on a dress I will never wear again, a gift for the bridal shower her future mother-in-law hosted, a gift and food for the naughty-themed bridal shower we, the bridesmaids, hosted (the maid of honor's idea), my plane ticket to Tampa for the wedding, and my hotel room stay. The Frisky: 10 super top-secret celebrity weddings . As the numbers continued to add up, and my credit card statements kept increasing, I tried to keep it together, but all I could feel was resentment. She never acknowledged the cost, just smiled and expected me to participate. To tackle my mounting debt, I cut back on dinners out and replaced them with Ramen noodles. I had tried to get out of the bridal party spa treatments she booked, but the pregnant pause and the chilly ""umm ... okay,"" she gave me over the phone made me feel like a bad friend. I gave in, of course, which not only made me mad at her, but mad at myself! The Frisky: My mom wants me to be skinny . I did my best to stay supportive, but as my animosity rose, I saw the sweet, small town girl from Podunk, Florida, as a flaming Bridezilla. Every time she mentioned the wedding, I cringed. I began to avoid her phone calls and disregard her emails. I contemplated having a heart-to-heart with her, but I just didn't see it going well. The day before the wedding, Bridezilla treated the bridesmaids to manicures and pedicures, and as her colors were black and white, she ""encouraged"" all of us to choose red for our nails. After she inspected my ""Leave It to Diva""-colored toes, I mentioned I was thinking of doing a nude color on my hands. Everything turned to slow motion as her breath caught, her eyes widened, and her mouth squared to protest. Before she could say anything, I grabbed the red polish and thrust it at the manicurist. Her open mouth spread into a smile ... and she hugged me. The Frisky: I'm not really sold on monogamy . In that moment I realized this was her Holy Grail, and I didn't want to ruin our friendship over money and nail polish. She asked me to share in her wedding; it was an ode to how important I am to her. I sucked it up and saw everything from another point of view. I got to party in Miami, chill by the pool in Tampa, and be V.I.P. at all the wedding events. I had to admit it was fun. I put on my new attitude the next day. The wedding was beautiful and I made sure to look stunning in my $1,500 dress with the stiff, lampshade-like flair at the bottom that I will never wear again. I also made sure to drink $1,000 worth of champagne. And in the end I didn't mind cutting back and plunking down a few more bucks a month on my credit card, because I got to hold on to my good friend.

"(CNN)A cluster of innocent eyes gaze up at a light shining above them. Packed inside a bunker along with jars of pickled beets and other provisions, they look like cherubs searching the sky for answers to their plight. These children hiding in Slovyansk, Ukraine, are looking at the camera of Andrea Rocchelli, a young Italian who died while photographing their stories. ""Andy was a very sincere person,"" said Luca Santese, who co-founded Cesura, a collaborative photo agency. ""He wasn't just about conquering the subjects. He was very sincere and dedicated to the stories he was doing."" Described by his Cesura colleagues as young, idealistic and very passionate, Rocchelli lived and breathed photography and storytelling. His last photographs, some still stored in his camera, project the maturity of a young man who, by then, had roamed confidently in dangerous war scenarios. ""Let's say he was a real fighter,"" said Arianna Arcara, another Cesura founding partner. Arcara said Rocchelli's bunker photos reflect the person he was and showed off his talent. ""When we saw those photos of the children in the bunker,"" she said, ""we knew we were dealing with some very potent images. ... He had reached maturity, he was on the cusp of something."" Rocchelli was barely 30 years old when mortar shells obliterated his convoy in May near Slovyansk. Authorities are still investigating the circumstances surrounding his death. His untimely death came as his work took on a more compositional aspect -- one of an artist, Santese said. ""He had found a language, an aesthetic that was very efficient not only to document but to project emotions,"" he said. Many of Rocchelli's photos had the imprint of a documentarian, testaments on the injustice, criminality and despair in the Ukrainian conflict. Other shots, especially of children as they inhabit the war landscape, are enveloped with softness and protection. Photographing these children in dark bunkers and hiding spaces, Rocchelli creates a womb-like image that highlights the purity of childhood versus the ugliness of war. Rocchelli was also by now a young father with an unordinary and somewhat risky profession. When news of his death arrived in Italy, some described him as a herald for a new era in journalism: the self-assigned, freelance journalists now roaming the world in dangerous zones, driven by idealism.

"Kyoto is Japan's historical heart, the former capital and home to 1,600 temples. From the entertainment district of Gion, where geishas can be spotted scurrying along narrow cobbled lanes, to the cherry tree-lined Philosopher's Path, some parts of the city seem timeless. But among the striking sights of ancient Kyoto sit less obtrusive buildings that capture the spirit of the city and remain a link between the past and the present. They are ""machiya"", traditional wooden townhouses. Their narrow frontage gives way to deep interiors, so long and thin that they became known as ""a bed for an eel"" (""unagi no nedoko,"" in Japanese). Megumi Hata lives in a machiya in Kyoto that has been in her family for 13 generations. ""This house is rare and very traditional and therefore our identity as Japanese has been nurtured in this house,"" she says. ""When I think about that, I would say this is the most amazing part of this house and this is what I love the most about it."" That enduring love of old homes is not universal in Japan. There is more financial incentive to destroy rather than preserve, as the structure of a home has very little market value after a few decades, and machiya have suffered from demolition and redevelopment. Around 80% of demolished machiya in the city are replaced by modern houses and high-rise buildings, according to the University of Kyoto, while the majority of those that remain have suffered some loss to their original facades. However some are focusing on preserving what remains of the city's old townhouses and believes that they should endure modern development. ""This one housing type has been developing over 1,200 years, continuously adapting to the different lifestyles, adapting and changing,"" says American designer Geoffrey Moussas who over a decade has renovated over 30 machiya. The challenges of renovation are huge. Moussas first had to learn from carpenters and craftsmen the special skills needed to build machiya before he could draw up practical renovation plans. But rather than build museums to a former way of life, Moussas is keen to create a fusion between the old and new. ""That balance is very important,"" he says. ""And that's the part that scares people (when it comes to renovations)."" ""There is a great satisfaction in taking something that was going to be thrown away and creating something that people admire, something that people appreciate. ""There is an unbelievable amount of culture in these houses."" Hata uses a modern analogy: We view our lives like software, something forever changing then this traditional architecture is the hardware, the very structure that gives Japanese life its foundation.","Kyoto is home to over 1,600 temples and former capital of Japan .

"After serving time, rapper Ja Rule is now on a more spiritual path. The artist, who had a thriving career in the early 2000s as part of the label Murder, Inc., told New York radio station Power 105.1 that he's gone from following a troubled path to seeking Christianity. Ja Rule, born Jeffrey Atkins, served roughly two years in jail for tax evasion charges and attempted criminal possession of a weapon. After his release in 2013, the rapper picked up a role in the movie ""I'm In Love with a Church Girl,"" and found himself growing interested in God as he promoted the project at churches. ""I kind of reconnected with God by doing the ... movie,"" Ja Rule told the radio station. ""I reconnected with God in a different way. I was going to all these different churches, ... (and they) were great, but I didn't feel like they were talking to me until I went to Hillsong right here in the city."" As he recounts in his new memoir, ""Unruly: The Highs and Lows of Becoming a Man,"" Ja Rule was raised by Jehovah's Witnesses. When his mother left the faith in his pre-teen years, the rapper says he soured on the religion. ""The family wasn't speaking to my mother, and I saw how much it hurt her,"" he recalled to Power 105.1. ""I didn't want to have anything to do with the religion at all."" But after his release from lockup, he found himself drawn to New York City's Hillsong Church. ""You walk into this church and it's dark in there and the disco ball is still in there and you see the lights and you're like ... well this is different,"" he said. ""And then you get in there and you start to look at everybody around you, and they look just like you -- it really gave me the feeling that when they say come as you are, they mean the skater kids in the back with the skateboards, like they just came off the street coming to church. It was a different type of crowd."" And when the church's pastor, wearing sneakers, jeans and a T-shirt, began to preach, ""I felt like he was talking to me,"" Ja Rule said. The rapper added that he and his wife, Aisha, were ""saved"" at Hillsong -- meaning they professed to be Christians -- and he's now trying to figure out how to practice his faith while still being in his profession. ""I want to make sure I'm doing the right thing. I don't want people to misconstrue what I'm doing here,"" Ja Rule said. ""I'm taking baby steps, and I want to get closer to God. I feel it's something you should do in life."" Since his baptism, Ja Rule said that he's become friends with the church's pastor, Carl Lentz. ""I started speaking to Carl, (saying), 'I don't know how to do this and take this, because you know what I do for a living. I'm not going to start making gospel records,"" Ja Rule said. ""He told me, 'Ja, take baby steps. Walk in your path.' ""","Rapper Ja Rule has described his path to Christianity .

"Tolib Ayombekov, a former opposition warlord believed to have been behind the killing of a top security general, surrendered to Tajik authorities early Tuesday, ending a three-week standoff, a government spokesman said. In a statement aired on Badakhshan TV, Ayombekov said he turned himself in to end the violence in Khorog, Pamir -- the capital of the Gorno-Badakshan region in eastern Tajikistan. More than 40 people were killed and many residents were displaced in recent fighting. Also communications with the outside world have been virtually severed during the fighting between Ayombekov's forces and government troops. The cutoff of cell phone and Internet service began late last month.  Aid workers, some of whom had satellite telephones, were evacuated. The government has accused Ayombekov's fighters in the July killing of Maj. Gen. Abdullo Nazarov, head of the regional branch of the State Committee on National Security, which is a successor to the Soviet KGB. In that incident, a group of unidentified people stopped Nazarov's car near Khorog, according to Ria-Novosti, a Russian state-run news service. He was pulled from the car, stabbed several times and died en route to a hospital, according to Ria-Novosti. A spokesman for the government in the Tajik capital of Dushanbe said the killing was ""the last straw."" He said the warlords were troublemakers. In his last public appearance before he went into hiding in late July, Ayombekov told reporters that Nazarov's security detail had failed to protect him. It was not clear what he meant by that. Ayombekov is the suspected leader of a ring that smuggled tobacco, precious jewels and drugs, the Central Asian News Service said. Until mid July, Ayombekov had been working for Nazarov overseeing border security between Tajikistan and Afghanistan, an administration official in Badakhshan told CNN. The official did not want to be identified because he is not allowed to speak to the news media. Tajikistan gained independence with the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 but has been troubled by a five-year civil war that ended in 1997 as well as widespread corruption and poverty, which continue today. Read more: Clinton discusses human rights, regional security in Tajikistan . Tensions remain high between the Tajik government in Dushanbe and the warlords-- so-called Komandos -- of Gorno-Badakshan, who are members of the Pamiri ethnic minority. The region was a stronghold of rebels during the civil war, which claimed thousands of lives. The war divided people along ethnic and regional lines, and the Pamiri largely sided with the opposition. A United Nations-brokered peace plan in 1997 left President Emomali Rakhmon's secular government in place but gave some of his opponents, including Ayombekov, official jobs. Rakhmon, who has Moscow's support, has sought to consolidate power and stamp out remnants of the former opposition-turned-warlords. Khorog residents said they had received no warning of the fighting that began three weeks ago. The official from the Badakhshan administration said residents told him they were not siding with anyone -- they just wanted safe passage out of Pamir.","At least 42 people are killed in fighting .

"The pro-Russian government of Ukraine's southeastern Crimean region declared independence Tuesday ahead of a scheduled referendum on whether to join Russia, ignoring international warnings that the vote won't be recognized. In the regional capital Simferopol, pro-Russian militiamen guarded the airport and train station, some wearing armbands that proclaimed their allegiance to ""the autonomous republic of Crimea."" Flights into the region from Ukraine's capital, Kiev, were canceled Tuesday, while flights from Moscow appeared to be landing as scheduled. A guard at the railway station told CNN that he and his comrades were looking out for weapons being shipped in from the rest of Ukraine. Tuesday's declaration from the Crimean parliament announced that if its population votes in favor of joining Russia on Sunday, it will ask the Russian Federation if it can join with Moscow. Almost immediately afterward, the Russian parliament announced it would debate whether to accept Crimea as part of the country on March 21. Ukraine's interim government, backed by the United States and European powers, has said the upcoming vote is illegitimate. And from Russia, ousted Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych -- run out of his country in a revolt that triggered the current crisis -- insisted he was still the legitimate leader and vowed to return to Kiev ""as soon as the circumstances allow."" Yanukovych fled Kiev on February 22, after three months of protests against his decision to scrap a trade deal with the European Union and embrace closer ties with Russia. Less than a week later, armed men seized the Crimean parliament building in Simferopol and raised the Russian flag above it. Ukrainian government forces in Crimea have been surrounded in their bases by well-equipped troops wearing uniforms with no insignia -- troops Western countries say are Russian but whom Moscow calls local ""self-defense"" forces. The move has effectively severed the strategic peninsula, which has an ethnic Russian majority, from the rest of Ukraine. U.S. and Western diplomats have urged Russia to enter into talks with Ukraine, but Russian officials have shown little interest. While the West is preparing sanctions against Russia over the standoff, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry has told his Russian counterpart, Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, that ""there is an off-ramp here,""  State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki told reporters in Washington. ""Any discussion about the future of Crimea needs to take place with the new government of Ukraine at the table, engaged in it, participating in that conversation,"" Psaki said. The United States understands that Russia has interests in Crimea, ""but those interests in no way justify military intervention or the use of force,"" she added. The U.S. House of Representatives Tuesday overwhelmingly approved a resolution condemning Russia for its military intervention in Ukraine and urging economic and other sanctions in response. In a 402-7 vote, lawmakers approved a nonbinding resolution stating that Russia's action poses a ""threat to international peace and security"" and calling on Russia to remove ""all of its military forces from Ukraine's Crimean peninsula"" other than those that are there in accordance with an agreement on operations of Russia's Black Sea fleet. The resolution urges the Obama administration to ""work with our European allies and other countries to impose visa, financial, trade, and other sanctions on senior Russian Federation officials, majority state-owned banks and commercial organizations, and other state agencies, as appropriate."" Lavrov said Monday that Kerry had postponed a face-to-face meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin to discuss U.S. proposals, which Moscow has effectively rejected. The meeting would have marked the highest-level contact between the two countries since Russian troops took up positions in Crimea. The head of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe also said the referendum would be illegal. Swiss Foreign Minister Didier Burkhalter, the OSCE's current chairman, said holding the referendum without everyone affected being on board would ""provoke tensions instead of leading to sustainable solutions."" OSCE monitors have been denied entry into Crimea by armed men several times since the crisis began. In a statement issued Tuesday evening, Russia's Foreign Ministry cited Kosovo's secession from Serbia -- a move recognized by Western governments over bitter opposition from Serbia and its historical allies in Moscow -- as precedent for the ""absolutely legitimate"" Crimean vote. ""The Russian Federation will respect the results of the free vote of Crimea's people during the referendum,"" it said. Amid tensions over Ukraine, space cooperation goes on . Lavrov and Kerry spoke on the phone Tuesday, both sides reported. During the conversation, Lavrov said Russia ""emphasized the need to respect the rights of all Ukrainians and all regions while looking for ways of solving the crisis, and the need to respect the rights of Crimea's citizens to determine their destiny by themselves in accordance with the international law,"" the Foreign Ministry said. French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius also called the referendum illegal, tweeting on his official account Tuesday that sanctions against Russia over its intervention in Crimea could come as soon as this week. Sanctions would include asset freezes and visa suspensions, he said. ""We have a firm position, but still we are seeking a political solution,"" Fabius tweeted. ""The only legitimate vote in Ukraine will be May 25, the upcoming presidential election."" And German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier said his government's current relationship with Russia cannot continue unless the country heeds calls to calm the situation. ""We are not only deeply worried, but we believe what is intended by Russia in view of the Crimea is completely unacceptable,"" Steinmeier said during a visit to the former Soviet republic of Estonia, now a NATO ally and European Union member. Steinmeier said Germany and Estonia ""agree that we will stand up to further escalations united and determined."" But in Crimea, pro-Russian forces were in firm control and warning loudly against ""fascists"" they claimed had seized power in Kiev. Ruslan Dudkin, a volunteer at a militia camp in Simferopol, compared the protesters who rallied in Kiev's Maidan Square to topple Yanukovych to ""cockroaches."" ""The people on the Maidan would soil and sleep and eat in the same place, it was worse than tramps,"" he said. Meanwhile, a commander of the notorious Berkut riot police -- disbanded after Yanukovych was ousted but celebrated as heroes in Crimea -- denounced the February revolt in Kiev. ""The Maidan was a provocation from start to finish,""  said Vladimir Krashevsky, whose forces appeared to have close ties to the militia. ""There was no democracy, and no real indignation from the people. It was a paid-for event."" And pro-Russian billboards portray Sunday's choice as one between a free Russia and a Ukraine under the swastika. Former U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright called that ""one of the more outrageous placards I have ever seen."" ""There are probably good-willed people who are concerned that their Slavic brothers and sisters are all of a sudden being subjected to fascism or Naziism, because that is what Russian TV is putting out,"" Albright told CNN's ""Amanpour"" program. ""There are a lot of older people who probably remember World War II and the tragedies that took place in Ukraine, and so this is just pure, unadulterated scare tactics,"" Albright added. And Fabius defended Ukraine's new government Tuesday, saying it was ""legitimately installed by the Ukrainian parliament"" and that the extreme right ""is not represented."" Yanukovych, meanwhile, made what was only his second public appearance since leaving Ukraine on Tuesday to insist he was still the country's rightful leader. Speaking in Rostov-on-Don in southwestern Russia, Yanukovych slammed the interim government in Kiev as ""a gang of ultranationalists and fascists."" Yanukovych, who spoke backed by the yellow-and-blue flag of Ukraine, insisted he is still the lawful leader of his country and will return to Kiev ""as soon as the circumstances allow."" ""I'm not just the legitimate President, but I am also the head of the military. I've not stopped my responsibilities, I'm alive, I've not been left without my powers,"" he said. Moscow has denounced the events that led to Yanukovych's ouster as an illegitimate coup and has refused to recognize the new Ukrainian authorities, putting the two countries on a collision course over control of Crimea. The Black Sea peninsula has been part of Ukraine since 1954 but has strong cultural and historical ties to Russia, which has a large, strategically important naval base in the Crimean port of Sevastopol. Putin has said his government has the right to protect ethnic Russians living there.

"Traveling while breast-feeding is no easy feat in the best of circumstances. When Transportation Security Administration officials don't follow the agency's rules, getting through the airport with the gear -- and a baby -- gets more difficult. A breast-feeding incident that has had TSA critics buzzing since last week was addressed in an apologetic blog post Thursday from the agency's ""Blogger Bob"" Burns. The controversy started when an agent at Kauai's Lihue Airport in Hawaii wouldn't allow passenger Amy Strand to board a plane February 29 with her breast pump because the milk bottles were empty, CNN affiliate KITV-TV in Honolulu reported. As a result Strand used her electric breast pump in a public airport restroom to fill the bottles and get them through security. She was traveling with her 9-month-old daughter, Eva. ""I had to stand in front of the mirrors and the sinks and pump my breast, in front of every tourist that walked into that bathroom,"" Strand told KITV. TSA admitted its agent made a mistake shortly afterward, saying in a statement: ""We accept responsibility for the apparent misunderstanding and any inconvenience or embarrassment this incident may have caused her. The officer in question is receiving remedial training."" Burns, the TSA blogger, announced Thursday that the agency has updated its website ""to help clarify the procedures for traveling with ice packs, breast milk, juice, and water."" The policy explained on the site now explicitly says that ice packs and empty bottles are permitted through security. ""Mistakes such as this happen from time to time and for that we are truly sorry,"" Burns wrote. ""However, we can and have learned from mistakes in the past, so please be sure to let us know when you think or know something could have been handled differently."" Burns advised passengers to ask for a supervisor in uncomfortable situations or to call TSA customer service numbers listed in his post -- 866-289-9673 and 855-787-2227. Commenters on Burns' post weren't all satisfied with his advice. One said: ""1) It has been frequently reported that TSA staff do not care whether or not something has been clearly stated on the website when they are imposing their own understanding of the rules; 2) It has been frequently reported that polite requests to speak with supervisors are treated as defiant behavior."" Those comments may refer to a 2010 incident involving a breast-feeding mother that resulted in a lawsuit against the TSA and Department of Homeland Security. According to the suit, Stacey Armato was traveling with breast milk for her 7-month-old son and requested alternate screening for the milk at a Phoenix International Airport checkpoint to avoid X-ray exposure. The suit says the same TSA agents she had encountered in the security line at the airport the week before retaliated against her for filing a complaint when her request for alternate screening for her breast milk in that instance met with resistance. The suit alleges that on her second encounter with the agents, Armato was directed to a ""special inspection"" area, where her requests to speak to a manager were refused. A uniformed police officer was also called in, according to court filings. Armato is suing on grounds of intentional infliction of emotional distress, invasion of privacy and false imprisonment. The suit alleges that screeners initially refused to review a printout that Armato provided of TSA guidelines pertaining to breast milk. The TSA said it sent a letter of apology to Armato shortly afterward. Despite some less-than-smooth incidents, many breast-feeding mothers pass through security with no trouble. One woman who said she's a nursing mother and hasn't had any trouble with security commented on the Strand incident: ""Like several have said, this is not representative of TSA as an agency, but the stupidity of that particular agent.""

"Today was a strange day. I'm used to handling the brief but overwhelming burst of media attention that comes with new stories about medical breakthroughs and ethical issues. But I don't often get an accompanying deluge of passionate e-mails and phone calls from people who had read my comments, denouncing me for criticizing science, especially medical research that ""can save millions of lives."" There is definitely something special about this idea of ""therapeutic cloning,"" something that has a religious feel to it. Most of those messages come from people who have family members suffering from some of the diseases that we are told will be cured, and it's hard to have to pour cold water on people's hopes. TIME: Scientists clone human stem cells . I feel really angry at the scientists and PR people who have sold the idea of cloned human stem cells to so many patient support groups, when there is so little scientific substance to their promises. We are told that there will be great medical benefits and that the risks that there will be cloned babies are small, but in truth it's the other way round. Let's deal with the cloned babies issue first. Ordinary people know perfectly well why human cloning is wrong, and that's why governments around the world, including all developed nations except the USA have banned it. But there are plenty of desperate people and egoistic tycoons wanting to be cloned, and plenty of unscrupulous IVF doctors happy to relieve them of their cash. And there are still countries where those doctors can go to evade legal sanctions. What the Oregon scientists have done is to deliver the baby that the would-be human cloners have been waiting for 15 years -- what looks like a reliable technique for creating cloned embryos. I think it was irresponsible to publish their research before there is a comprehensive global ban on cloning, with tough sanctions. But I think what makes me even angrier as a scientist is the hype and false promises around therapeutic cloning. Let's be clear: this is not about embryonic stem cell research, which, despite the hype may deliver something given time, although the alternatives of adult stem cells and induced pluripotent stem cells look set to deliver results much quicker. And I'm not a pro-lifer; destruction of embryos is not what bothers me. The cloning element is there purely for the purposes of creating tissues genetically identical to the patient that won't be rejected, and that's a nice idea. The trouble is it brings a whole raft of biological problems with it that create major risks to the patient as well as creating an impossibly expensive process. With cloning, you are forcing nature to do something that it does not want to, so the new risks are to be expected. Cloning creates abnormalities in the genetic read-out, which is the reason that cloned animals are so often sick. Those errors will be there in any stem cells and tissues produced by cloning. Those problems are another reason why cloning babies would be hugely unethical, but they don't necessarily make it impossible. Finally, even if you could somehow solve these problems, the use of genetically matched tissues in mainstream medicine is simply not feasible and, unlike electronic gadgets, medical costs go up, not down. In addition to the extremely expensive process of cloning, for each patient you have to culture stem cells and reliably turn them into the tissue you want with 100% efficiency, so you don't get a single left over stem cell that will cause tumors. You have to do all that to a standard of accuracy that will satisfy government regulators and medical liability lawyers when something goes wrong. Forget it. We don't do anything remotely approaching this in medicine and it doesn't look like medical budgets are growing, does it? There are other much better solutions to the tissue rejection problem that will cost a fraction of the price. The fact is that the cloning paper published on Wednesday is zombie science. Therapeutic cloning was dead and buried years ago, but it just seems to keep on going, and so do people's hopes. There is definitely something weird here, something that brings out religious terminology like ""the Holy Grail of medicine"" around therapeutic cloning. That's because therapeutic cloning is a fantasy, one that belongs to the modern religion, the religion of technocracy. That's the only way I can explain how scientists who ought to know better seem to get drunk on their power over nature and keep pursuing this absurd dream. People often say to me that scientists pursuing therapeutic cloning are ""just trying to make money,"" but the truth is worse. Driven by their technocratic ideology, they betray their own credo of sticking to the facts, and that's bad enough. But to keep raising people's hopes in this way is really unforgivable.","Scientists in Oregon say they've successfully cloned human stem cells for first time .

"Punxsutawney Phil lied. That's what a prosecutor in Ohio says. He has filed a criminal ""indictment"" against the famed groundhog, who, year for year on February 2, emerges from his burrow at Gobbler's Knob to predict whether spring will come early or winter will linger. If he sees his shadow, it means six more weeks of chill. If not, short sleeves are days away. This year, Phil got it wrong, and it's not the first time. On the first day of spring this past Wednesday, the Northeast got pelted with more than a foot of snow. It's still cold two days later, and more chilly weather is in the forecast. Snow on the first day of spring . Michael T. Gmoser is sick of it, and he wants someone to pay. ""I woke up this morning and the wind was blowing, the snow was flying, the temperatures were falling, and I said 'Punxsutawney, you let us down,' "" the prosecutor told CNN affiliate WXIX. The homepage of the Butler County, Ohio, prosecutor's office, which Gmoser heads, prominently features alerts against scammers. Shadows aren't just for groundhogs . Gmoser is convinced that Phil is one and that he intentionally misled the nation. Now, trouble with the law is a brewing for the famous rodent from Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania. Not really. It's all in good fun, of course, and Phil's handlers are getting in on the joke. But they are not ""ratting"" him out. ""If you remember two weeks ago on a Sunday, it was probably 60, 65 degrees,"" handler John Griffiths told WXIX in Phil's defense.  ""So, I mean, that basically counts as an early spring."" After snow storms and blizzards for weeks from Arizona to the Dakotas and into the Midwest and New England, not many Americans may buy it. But Phil may not be at fault. Some may have thought in the past that his predictions were a vast conspiracy. After all, he is sponsored by two clubs, a handful of corporations and two banks. On Phil's website, Groundhog.org, his handlers dispute the theory. ""No, Punxsutawney Phil's forecasts are not made in advance by the Inner Circle,"" they write. The off prediction could have been a mistranslation. Phil ""speaks to the Groundhog Club President in Groundhogese,"" according to the website. ""His proclamation is then translated for the world.""  What if the president can't hear correctly over the crowd? Is it then still really Phil's fault? Gmoser is sticking by his guns. ""Punxsutawney Phil did purposely, and with prior calculation and design, cause people to believe that Spring would come early,"" the indictment reads. He recommends the death penalty. ""He's already serving a life sentence behind bars, as you know,"" Gmoser told WXIX. Phil has been making his predictions since 1887 and will probably continue. Extraditing him from Pennsylvania to Ohio to stand trial is unlikely, since transporting wild animals across state lines can be illegal. People may be angry with Phil about his prediction as winter's chill dawdles. But lighten up. He's just a groundhog.","Ohio prosecutor Michael Gmoser is going after Phil for deception .
Phil predicted a short winter and a quick arrival of spring .

"The loss of a second Boeing 777 in 131 days threatens Malaysia Airlines with another public relations and financial blow as it struggles to overcome industry and consumer fallout after the disappearance of Flight 370. On Thursday, Flight 17 heading from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur crashed in eastern Ukraine, according to reports from the Russian news agency Interfax. Early speculation centered on the possibility it was shot down at an altitude of more than 30,000 feet. The company confirmed that it lost contact with the flight -- coded MH17. Its last known position was over Ukrainian airspace. The plane is said to have crashed in eastern Ukraine near the border with Russia. Russian-backed separatists are fighting the Ukrainian military in the region. As the tragedy unfolds with the obvious potential for significant wreckage and devastating loss of life, the threat to Malaysia Airlines as a company is potentially greater than any single airline disaster, said corporate turnaround expert Ted Gavin, founding partner and managing director of Gavin/Solmonese. ""This is a potentially fatal event for that airline, but also it's an event for them to redeem themselves in how they deal with information and the public,"" he said. Missing Flight 370 . In the weeks following the disappearance of Flight 370, some family members of passengers were harshly critical of Malaysia Airlines and Malaysian aviation authorities regarding the investigation. Family members accused airline officials of not offering information about how they responded immediately after the plane disappeared. In the months that followed, they expressed distrust of the airline and Malaysia's government. ""The way Malaysia Airlines handled the disappearance of the last jet was a huge hit to confidence,"" said Gavin. In the immediate hours following Thursday's disaster, Gavin said ""the airline needs to share every piece of information and every piece of data they have, including the decision making process that led to that plane flying over a recent conflict region."" It also must be unashamed to discuss possible mistakes that were made, said Gavin. ""What can't happen is week-long deliberations where families of crash victims don't hear from them or don't know anything."" ""Frankly this is an opportunity for them to talk about what they've learned and what they've done better and what they've done differently since Flight 370."" Full story . Searchers are apparently no closer to solving the mystery surrounding the Malaysia AIrlines flight which went missing March 8 en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing with 239 passengers and crew. This month, the airline's main shareholder was considering restructuring the operation and taking it private, the Wall Street Journal reported. The Journal used the words ""turn around"" and ""resuscitate"" to describe the strategy. Malaysia's Prime Minister Najib Razak tweeted Thursday that Malaysia is launching an immediate investigation into the loss of Flight 17. In April, the Federal Aviation Administration ordered U.S. airlines to avoid airspace over Crimea, the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov. It said the region posed the ""potential for conflicting air traffic control instructions from Ukrainian and Russian authorities"" and the ""misidentification of civil aircraft."" It's unknown if Malaysian aviation officials issued a similar warning. The airline still faces possible lawsuits from family members that could total millions of dollars. Boeing's twin-engine 777  boasts an excellent safety record and is among the most sophisticated airliners flying today. Its capacity is between 300 and 450 passengers and a range of about 5,700 miles. ""There have been bad years for commercial aviation,"" Gavin said. ""But for one airline to lose two of the same type of airframe in such a short time span? It's potentially unprecedented for a commercial carrier in the modern aviation age."" Financial troubles . Analysts said it may take a government rescue to save the company from financial disaster. Malaysia Airlines has faced increased competition in recent years from new regional airlines. It tried to boost revenue by selling more tickets, rather than raising prices, while keeping operating costs under control. It has also canceled some longer flight routes. But the strategy never took hold, and the difficult business climate has forced the airline into the red for the past three years, leading to a loss of about $1.3 billion over that period. The Malaysian government has helped the largely unprofitable airline before, though its previous efforts seemed only to provide temporary respite. Malaysia Air may need government rescue .

"Tensions between U.S. President Barack Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu have been strained for years. But the conflict in Gaza has ushered in a new low, some analysts say. ""It's probably the worst relationship between a leader of the United States and a leader of Israel since all the way back to the Eisenhower days,"" says David Gergen, a senior political analyst for CNN who served as adviser to four U.S. presidents. ""The relationship has gotten rockier over this period during the war."" While Obama and Netanyahu emphasize friendship and mutual support publicly, a series of recent events present a different picture. Blaming Israel for an attack that killed several people at a school in Gaza, the United States said it was ""appalled"" by the ""disgraceful shelling"" -- sharp criticism from Washington rarely heard when Israel is engaged in battle. ""When you have a situation where innocent civilians are killed in Gaza, there's more that Israel can do to hold themselves to their own standards,"" State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said. ""We do hold ourselves to a very high standard. And when innocent civilians are caught in the cross fire between us and Hamas, it's an operational failure from our point of view,"" Israeli government spokesman Mark Regev countered on CNN. More than than 1,800 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza during the conflict, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry. The United Nations estimates about 70% were civilians, but Israel Defense Forces say about 900 militants were killed, as were 64 Israeli soldiers and three civilians in Israel. Netanyahu did not deny reports that he told U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and U.S. Ambassador to Israel Dan Shapiro ""not to ever second-guess me again"" on how to deal with Hamas, which is in charge of the Palestinian government in Gaza.  Hamas has launched hundreds of attacks, including rockets, against Israeli civilians. In describing its military action publicly, Israeli officials have compared it to U.S. military actions against terrorism. U.S. anti-terror tactics in recent years have included drone strikes, which Obama has increased in Pakistan and Yemen. Hundreds of civilians, including children, have been killed, according to The Bureau of Investigative Journalism. So when the United States slams civilian deaths in Israeli military actions, Israel can in turn point to U.S. military actions -- including wars in Afghanistan and Iraq -- that also have killed civilians. ""That's a logical, compelling argument, and Israelis have made it repeatedly,"" says Aaron David Miller, who served as an adviser on Arab-Israeli negotiations under both Republican and Democratic administrations. That resonates with the American public, Miller says. But it does not speak to a central concern for Obama. ""His priority is to make the bad pictures from Gaza go away...  He is much more focused on the middle class than on the Middle East."" Why things are different with Obama . There's always been some dysfunction in the U.S.-Israeli relationship, says Miller, now a vice president with the Middle East program at the Wilson Center. But there have also been strong personal connections. ""I loved him as much as anyone I've ever known,"" Clinton once said of slain Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin. But Obama and Netanyahu ""haven't liked each other from the beginning,"" Gergen says. In 2011, inadvertently open microphones caught French President Nicolas Sarkozy calling Netanyahu ""a liar,"" followed by Obama's reply: ""You're tired of him; what about me? I have to deal with him every day,"" according to reports. Despite differences, in the past, U.S. and Israeli administrations ""got a lot done"" together, Miller says. By contrast, he says, the Obama administration ""can't produce anything."" ""These guys haven't found a project on which they can basically cooperate."" While united in the goal of preventing Iran from getting nuclear weapons -- which Tehran insists it is not seeking -- Obama and Netanyahu are split in how to go about it. And Kerry is ""is 0-for-3,"" Miller says. His nine months of pushing for peace talks failed, as did his two efforts to achieve a cease-fire to halt the hostilities in recent weeks. The truce under way now was brokered by Egypt -- and apparently quite similar to the Egyptian cease-fire plan that Israel accepted and Hamas rejected throughout the conflict. Miller believes a ""generational divide"" on Israel separates Obama from preceding presidents. Clinton and President George W. Bush felt ""emotionally bonded to Israel,"" Miller says. ""Obama is not."" 'Too big to fail' Despite the tensions, the countries remain critical allies, analysts say. Netanyahu on Sunday praised President Obama's ""unequivocal stand with Israel on our right to defend ourselves"" as well as the ""untiring efforts"" of Kerry. He also called Shapiro ""a great ambassador."" And White House spokesman Josh Earnest said ""the nature of the relationship is strong and unchanged."" At a joint appearance in March, Obama said, ""There's nobody I've met with more or consulted with more than Bibi. And it's a testimony to the incredible bond between our two nations. I've said before and I will repeat, we do not have a closer friend or ally than Israel and the bond between our two countries and our two peoples in unbreakable. And that's the reason why on a whole spectrum of issues we consult closely."" The United States has continued supplying Israel with weapons during the conflict. And documents revealed by NSA leaker Edward Snowden allegedly detail how the United States shares raw intelligence data with Israel. ""The relationship is one between two close allies and there is tension between them at this moment,"" says Nathan Thrall, senior analyst with the International Crisis Group. They can ""overcome"" it ""once the conflict is ended,"" says Robert Danin of the Council on Foreign Relations. Outside of their top leaders, the connection between the two countries seems unshakeable, analysts say.  ""Unlike Lehman Brothers,"" says Miller, ""this relationship is too big to fail.""","""Probably the worst relationship"" for U.S., Israeli leaders since Eisenhower, an analyst says .

"A carbon monoxide leak at a Wisconsin ice rink left 81 people hospitalized -- and an ice resurfacing machine could be to blame. The leak occurred Saturday at the end of a minor league hockey game between the Dells Ducks and the Ice Hawks in Lake Delton. Dozens of people were treated at local hospitals for dizziness, nausea, headaches, vomiting and fainting, authorities said. Delton Fire Department officials said the cause of the leak was the rink's resurfacing machine, CNN affiliate WISC reported. The incident started  when several players complained of headaches and dizziness. Some had vomited and one had fainted, the Delton Fire Department said in a statement. It said it recorded high readings of  the gas from inside the Poppy Waterman Ice Rink, but at the time of the leak, many hockey players, staff and spectators had left. Fire and emergency personnel went to various locations to seek out those who had attended the game and transport them to hospital, the fire department said. Activities at the ice rink were canceled for Monday. ""The good thing about this is a lot of people got sick all at once, so it was recognized quickly and the exposure was pretty limited,"" Matt Lazio, director of St. Clare's emergency department, told WISC.

"Italian explorer Marco Polo spent 17 years working in the court of Kublai Khan's China, but today most foreigners seeking to live and work in the country aren't looking for the same time-invested cultural exchange. ""It's the place to make money,"" explained Aynura Askerova, a Russian who has lived in the southern Chinese metropolis of Guangzhou for four years. Work as a fashion model has taken Askerova across China and the rest of Asia, but ""now it's time to find a real career,"" she said last month, in an overly-illuminated hotel conference room in the city's China Marriott Hotel. Like hundreds of other visitors from across the world, the graduate in software development from Kazan State University was there for the Jobs Fair for Foreigners; one of three annual events organized by the Chinese government, where expats get a rare chance to meet prospective employers face-to-face. The events have been a honeypot for job-seeking expats, particularly since the global economic crisis of 2008. While economic growth in China has slowed in the last year, the 7% to 8% predicted growth is positively booming compared to Europe and the United States, leading many to believe their prospects there might be better than at home. However the perception that expats, particularly from western countries, can just walk into a job or career in China is now out of date. ""The novelty of being a foreigner has worn off,"" said Shanghai-based Simon Lance, regional director in China for recruitment firm Hays. ""Employers are seeking value. Demonstrating a genuine commitment to China is key."" That can include language skills and being willing to spend more than just one or two years in the country, he added. Read more: Can China become a melting pot? According to a report by the state-run Xinhua news agency, nearly 7 million new Chinese graduates entered the jobs market last year. It's a figure that is set to increase in the coming years as China expands its number of higher education institutions, adding to the challenge for foreigners embarking on their careers in the country. ""That side of the workforce there's almost an oversupply of junior end candidates,"" said Lance. ""So it's hard for expats to compete. Without Mandarin or local language skills I'd say it's almost impossible."" Nick Cucinella, CEO at CareerBuilder China, advises graduates to have a CV in both English and Chinese, even if they don't speak the language, and that taking the initiative and targeting prospective employers and Chinese companies is the best path to a job. ""Not many people do that, but if they do they will be very well received. Too many just use jobs sites and search engines,"" he said. Read more: The best job in 2013 is... However for those with established careers and particular skill-sets, demand exceeds supply in many industries. Big infrastructure projects in China mean that recruitment companies are seeing a desire for experienced architects and design engineers, plus a strong demand for those in the pharmaceutical industry, as local and international companies invest in R&D facilities in the country. ""Chinese companies  realize they have to offer more than just a job, but show that the city is good place to live, raise children and there's enough going on,"" said Cucinella. The recruitment process in China could also seem quite strange to many westerners. ""At a market in China you're expected to haggle and that applies in some way to job negotiations. Westerners don't want to feel like they're haggling over their life, they want to feel wanted,"" said Cucinella. However a larger trend is localizing the workforce across positions, believes Lance. If the employers he recruits for have a wish-list it is usually for a Chinese national who has gained many years of experience studying or working abroad. These ""haigui,"" or sea turtles as they are called in China, hit the employment sweet spot with ""both the cultural connection and the language skills,"" according to Lance. ""They provide a pretty good compromise between being able to connect and communicate with local Chinese staff, but have a good understanding of western business and management practice. They bridge the two worlds quite well."" Read more: Can Twitter get you a job? For those expats at the Guangzhou event swimming against the rising tide of competition, employing a number of techniques is necessary to make it in China -- local connections being one of the most useful. ""Having a connection, or 'guanxi,' is important,"" said German national Max Storz, who found a sales job in Guangzhou through a contact of his girlfriend. ""It helps a lot to find a job and get things done in general."" It's worked for Askerova, too. With business partners she met in China, she has been able to register a trading company in Hong Kong alongside developing a modeling career. ""There are cultural differences to work out, and it was hard for me at first (living in Guangzhou), very different,"" she said. ""But there is really nowhere else like it.""","For foreigner graduates it is increasingly hard to find jobs and develop careers .

"Africa is in the middle of an amazing demographic shift. Our continent is the only one where the size of the younger generation is rising significantly. Our population is already 16 years younger than in China, and this is only the beginning. Within less than three generations, four out of ten of the world's youth will live on our continent. This demographic dividend -- and the energy and enthusiasm it brings -- offers us a unique advantage which other continents facing the prospect of a rapidly aging population and dwindling workforce can only envy. In a world changing with breakneck speed, it is young people who are best equipped to identify and deliver fresh solutions to our problems. But we will only fully reap these benefits if we listen to young people, engage with them and provide the education, skills and support they need to prosper. Despite progress, we continue to fail to rise to this challenge. Young people, all too often, find their interests overlooked and their voices ignored. Read this: 'Afropreneurs' will shape Africa's future . There can be no clearer symbol of this disconnect than the age of those who continue to set the direction of our countries and their citizens. For while the median age of Africa's population is now 20 and falling, the average age of our continent's leaders is around 60. I am not arguing, of course, that teenagers should be put in charge of countries. Experience counts in government even more than in business.  But Africa must ask itself why our continent appears so frightened of giving the younger generation a chance. After all, David Cameron and Tony Blair both became UK Prime Ministers for the first time when they were 43.  Barack Obama first became President of the United States at the age of 47. Even more importantly, he will step down, because of the constitution, eight years after he entered the White House. In contrast, Africa has just witnessed an 89-year old sworn in as President of Zimbabwe, a post he first gained 25 years ago. And this was after he had already led his country as Prime Minister for nearly a decade. The truth is that it is not so much the age that our leaders first come to power which is the problem but their reluctance to relinquish it. Where necessary, constitutional terms are altered to allow them to continue long after they were supposed to step down. Read this: Holding African governments to account . The result is that political power lies in the hands of aging leaders who have little knowledge or interest in the ambitions and concerns of younger generations -- and sadly even less interest in passing on the reins of leadership. It is why, when we set up the Ibrahim Prize for Achievement in African Leadership in 2007, we made it a condition that only those democratically elected leaders who hand over power voluntarily at the end of their constitutional term would be eligible. Even in countries where leaders do not confuse their own interests with those of their country, our young people can find themselves locked out of decision-making and debate. They react, not surprisingly, by turning their backs on the political process. Electoral turnout is falling among the young and political apathy is on the rise. Read this: Africa's rocky road to democracy . The danger is that, denied the chance of peaceful change, despair and anger is fostered. We must at least enable our young people to play a more active part in the decision-making process. If we do not, we will see even more leaders overthrown. The risk of creating a marginalized youth only seems to increase when you look at the job market. Our young people are better educated but enjoy less employment opportunities than their parents. We can't just rely on their numbers to drive Africa's continued economic progress. We need renewed efforts to provide them with the skills they need to fill the jobs of the future. We urgently need to foster national debates involving businesses, education specialists and young people themselves to build the skilled workforce Africa requires to compete globally. It's time Africa started listening to our young people, instead of always telling them what to do. It is their potential, after all, which will decide our continent's future.  Let's not waste it.","Africa has a young population, and aging leaders, says Mo Ibrahim .

"London, England (CNN) -- Britain's prime minister on Tuesday defended the mission in Afghanistan as ""vital"" to protecting his country from terrorists, following the death of the 100th British serviceman in Afghanistan this year. The soldier, from the 1st Battalion The Royal Anglian Regiment, was killed Monday by small arms fire in the Nad-e Ali area of Afghanistan's southern Helmand province, Britain's Ministry of Defence said. His name was not released, but the soldier's next of kin were informed, the ministry said. The soldier was the 100th member of the British armed forces to die in Afghanistan this year, the ministry said. Britain has lost more than 200 service personnel in the country since the start of fighting in 2001. British Prime Minister Gordon Brown emphasized the ""real impact"" of the Afghan mission as he offered his condolences to the soldier's family. ""Our military presence in Afghanistan means that al Qaeda cannot use the country as a base from which to plot terrorist attacks against Britain,"" Brown said in a statement Monday. ""And the work of our armed forces in the next stage of the campaign, the training and partnering of the Afghan security forces to do this job for themselves, along with the political and civilian development of the country, will be vital in ensuring the British people are safer for generations to come."" British Defence Secretary Bob Ainsworth also defended the importance of the mission to security at home. ""I believe we must keep at the forefront of our minds why our people are in Afghanistan,"" Ainsworth said in a statement. ""Our presence in Afghanistan is vital in preventing it from once again becoming a haven for terrorists who would seek to threaten the UK."" Ainsworth said ""taking the fight to the insurgents"" -- along with providing security and training Afghan security forces -- will help Afghanistan become stable and independent. The death came a week after Brown announced that the UK would send an extra 500 troops to Afghanistan in early December, bringing the British contingent there to more than 9,500. Brown regularly links British security to events in Afghanistan and Pakistan, saying attacks on London and other British targets have been planned in South Asia. He announced in October the decision in principle to boost force levels but said certain conditions -- including proper equipment for the British troops and more troop commitments from other countries -- had to be met first. The UK has the largest contingent in Afghanistan after the United States. The figure of 9,500 does not include special forces, said Brown, who declined to say exactly how many of those were there, but indicated it is more than 500.","Britain's prime minister and defense secretary defend mission in Afghanistan as ""vital""

"It's been more than four years since the McStay family went missing, and nearly eight months have passed since their remains were found in the Mojave Desert. Who would want to kill Joseph; his wife, Summer; and their two young kids, Gianni, 4, and Joseph Jr., 3? How did their bodies end up in two shallow graves some 100 miles north of their home? Investigators still have not named any suspects or persons of interest, but those involved aren't giving up. A new detective recently joined the investigation, bringing new energy and new ideas to the table. As the investigation continues, here are five questions that could provide clues about the case: . 1. Who used Joseph McStay's phone shortly after he disappeared? On February 4, 2010, Chase Merritt received a phone call from Joseph McStay. It was 8:28 p.m. Chase, Joseph's close friend, picked up the phone, looked at it, and set it back down. ""I had a bunch of other things I was doing, and I was just tired,"" he told CNN. Joseph ran a custom water feature business, and he often bought custom indoor waterfalls from Chase. The two talked frequently. Chase had already talked to Joseph multiple times that day, and they had also met in person for a couple of hours. ""I had no idea that something like this was going to happen,"" said Chase. Was that just a regular call from his friend, or could it have been a call for help? ""There are hundreds of scenarios. I have gone over all of them in my head,"" he added. ""Of course I regret not picking up the phone."" What happened to the McStays? 2. Who used Summer McStay's credit card the day she disappeared? According to phone records, Summer McStay made a call from her home phone at 2:11 p.m. February 4 regarding purchasing herbal medicine. Financial records show her credit card was used 25 minutes later at a store in Vista, California, about 20 minutes from her home. It's not clear whether Summer was the one who made that purchase. ""That is certainly a piece of evidence that we would review if there's any video or any documentation to support who was at that store and used that credit card,"" said John McMahon, sheriff of San Bernardino County. ""Every piece of evidence in this case is critical,"" he said. 2013: Who were the McStays? 3. Did Joseph McStay's business have anything to do with his families' disappearance? In the months before his disappearance, business at Joseph's company was good. So good, in fact, that Joseph was working on a deal that could have been worth $9 million, his father, Patrick McStay, said. By summer of 2011, Dan Kavanaugh, who worked for Joseph managing his company's website, had sold the business to an outside company. Patrick was enraged. ""He owned nothing of --- any part of, any share of, anything,"" he said. Dan, however, said he and Joseph split everything 50-50. ""We shared ownership from the beginning of starting the company,"" he said. Although Patrick had his suspicions about Kavanaugh, Dan has maintained his alibi and innocence. ""I was in Hawaii for over a month before he disappeared,"" he said. And the evidence CNN has uncovered seems to indicate Kavanaugh was in Hawaii around the initial days of the McStays' disappearance. 4. Why was someone using the McStays' computer to research traveling to Mexico? One week before the McStays went missing, someone used their home computer to search for information on how to get children into Mexico. Four days after they disappeared, detectives say the family's white Isuzu Trooper was parked and subsequently towed from a parking lot just steps from the Mexican border. Investigators also found surveillance video showing a family of four matching the McStays' description crossing on foot into Mexico on February 8. ""I just thought, 'Well, maybe they took off,' "" said Joseph's mother, Susan Blake. But his father wasn't buying it. ""I said right up front, the first time I saw it (the surveillance footage), it wasn't them,"" said Patrick, adding that Summer was afraid of Mexico. ""Would Summer take her two children in there? Heck, no,"" he said. Still, investigators want to know whether the computer search and their disappearance were related. 5. Was crucial evidence in the McStay family home destroyed? Eleven days after the McStays went missing, Joseph's brother Michael called the Sheriff's Department.  He said he waited so long because he didn't want to overreact and thought the family might just be on vacation. Brother to killers: 'You guys are cowards' The Sheriff's Department immediately alerted homicide, but it took investigators four days to obtain the warrants needed to complete a full search of the home. During those three days, the McStay home was unsealed. The McStays' friends and family had some access in and out of the house. Joseph's mother straightened up the kitchen, which she says smelled terrible because of the trash. Michael McStay said the house was not deemed a crime scene because there was no sign of forced entry. With investigators' permission, he said, he grabbed his brother's computer and SD card. Given all of the foot traffic in the house, freelance investigative journalist Steph Watts said critical evidence could have been lost. ""Certain items that might have been really key to the big mystery of why they left that house are gone,"" he said.","The bodies of the McStay family were found in the desert last year .
The family was last seen alive in February 2010 .
Detectives have not named any suspects ."
"Barely a month after pulling off a smashing re-election victory, Republican New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie finds himself fending off a local scandal that has become an early stumbling block on his road to a run for president in 2016.  And despite Christie's cries of foul -- he claims Democrats are making a mountain out of a molehill -- all indications are that the Republican hopeful has nobody to blame but himself for his current woes. As he prepares to ascend to the national stage -- and the glare of the spotlight that comes with it -- Christie must change some of the funky, in-your-face combative style that serves him well in New Jersey but is likely to cause voters in places such as Iowa and New Hampshire to recoil in horror. Democrats in the New Jersey Legislature are still using hearings and subpoenas to piece together the particulars, but the general shape of the controversy is already known. In early September, some serious mischief appears to have been done by close associates of Christie's who work at the Port Authority, a gargantuan $2.57 billion agency that controls the bridges and tunnels between New York and New Jersey along with area airports and the World Trade Center. Without notice to the public or the agency's executive director, the Port Authority abruptly closed a set of local roads leading to the George Washington Bridge -- the busiest crossing in the world, handling 100 million vehicles a year -- causing massive traffic snarls in Fort Lee, New Jersey.  Democrats believe the shutdown was an act of political retaliation because the town's mayor, Mark Sokolich, refused to endorse Christie's re-election. Nobody is admitting guilt, and Christie calls the political-payback accusation ""crazy.""  But two political appointees at the agency who are close to Christie -- one is a childhood friend -- have resigned. ""Mistakes were made,"" the governor acknowledged in an hourlong press conference. As local Democrats demand e-mails, memos and sworn testimony, the national party swiftly pounced, releasing a two-minute video called ""Chris Christie's Bridge Scandal Explained."" The controversy will likely be long forgotten by the time the race for president gets under way in earnest, but it's safe to assume that no politician likes to see stories with headlines that include words such as ""scandal"" and ""payback."" The idea that Christie might have inflicted pain on an entire town to settle a political score with its mayor also plays into an unflattering image of Christie as a bully -- a reputation underscored by videos that show the governor berating teachers, journalists and town hall participants. Christie fans in New Jersey love to see him telling people off, but that appeal doesn't necessarily translate to the national stage. In fact, it's safe to assume that if Christie runs for president, those videos will resurface as attack ads that question his judgment and self-control. More importantly, the controversy takes some of the luster off Christie's case -- spotlighted in a recent Time magazine cover story   -- that he, rather than fire-breathing tea party conservatives, can best lead the Republican Party to victory in 2016. A big part of Christie's appeal -- an image he has carefully cultivated -- is that he's a Republican with proven ability to win over Democratic and independent voters. A former prosecutor, Christie has built a case for his crossover appeal by pointing to his two victories in New Jersey, a state where Democrats outnumber Republicans by 700,000 and independent voters outnumber both parties. ""Maybe the folks in Washington, D.C., should tune in their TVs right now, see how it's done,"" Christie crowed on Election Night this year, challenging congressional Republicans -- and the national Republican Party -- to follow his lead. Christie's much-publicized working relationship with President Barack Obama, which infuriated some Republicans, was another step in the same direction, as was his rounding up support from Democratic Party officials -- an effort so successful that Christie's Democratic opponent, state Sen. Barbara Buono, publicly declared that ""Democratic political bosses — some elected and some not — made a deal with this governor despite him representing everything they're supposed to be against,"" which she called a ""betrayal."" It could turn out that Christie's followers went overboard in the effort to round up Democratic support -- and that their zeal led to the punishment allegedly visited on Democrats such as the mayor of Fort Lee.  That could turn Christie into a punching bag for national Democrats and erode his crossover appeal. For the sake of his presidential ambitions, it's in Christie's best interests to get all the facts about the bridge controversy on the table as quickly as possible -- and then begin a long-term makeover to ensure that his image remains one of a blunt, tough-talking guy -- not a petty and short-tempered bully.","Errol Louis: Scandal brings new scrutiny to Chris Christie if he decides to run for president .

"They are people children are supposed to trust: A New York Police Department officer, a Fire Department of New York paramedic, a rabbi and a scoutmaster were among more than 70 people arrested in a major child porn bust, authorities said Wednesday. One of those arrested -- a supervisor with the Transportation Security Administration -- allegedly traveled to the Dominican Republic to have sex with children, a law enforcement official said. He allegedly made more than 50 trips there. The investigation, involving agents from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement as well as New York authorities, began as part of an undercover operation into peer-to-peer networks, authorities told reporters Wednesday. The suspects, who do not appear to know one another, were able to search files using graphic terms and descriptions. Software continuously scanned files and automatically uploaded images to personal computers, laptops and mobile phones. Special Agent in Charge James Hayes, head of Homeland Security Investigations New York, called the arrests the largest enforcement operation in New York ""targeting predators (who) possess, produce or distribute sexually explicit images of children."" The activity, he said, has ""reached epidemic proportions."" ""The backgrounds of many of the individuals ... is shocking,"" Hayes said. ""These defendants come from all walks of life ... This operation puts the lie to the classic stereotypical profile that child predators are nothing more than unemployed drifters. Many of the defendants are, in fact,  well-educated and successful in private and professional lives. They work as registered nurses, paramedics, caretakers for mentally ill adults,  computer programers and architects."" The continuing operation resulted in 71 arrests -- including one woman -- and the seizure of nearly 600 devices, including desktop and laptop computers, tablets, smartphones and thumb drives with tens of thousands of sexually explicit images and videos of children, Hayes said. The pornographic images of children were shared at no charge, authorities said. About a third of the suspects remain in custody, and the others were released on bonds ranging from $30,000 to $500,000. Hayes said the January arrest of Brian Fanelli, chief of the Mount Pleasant Police Department in upstate Valhalla, New York, on child pornography violations helped lead to the other defendants. State and federal authorities said the alleged offenders included: . •NYPD Sgt. Alberto Randazzo is on paid suspension after being arrested in February 2013 by the Internal Affairs Bureau on 57 felony counts of child pornography. Randazzo was allegedly communicating with women in video chat rooms and ordering the women to sexually abuse their children, prosecutors said. In one video allegedly recorded by Randazzo, he can be heard directing a woman to molest her infant child. •Samuel Waldman, a rabbi and an instructor of Judaic studies, was arrested at his Brooklyn residence and charged under federal law with possession of child pornography, prosecutors said. Using a file sharing system, agents identified Waldman's IP address as one that offered the dissemination of videos of child pornography. •Kenneth Gardner, a registered nurse at Westchester County Medical Center, was arrested in April at his residence in Queens, New York. He was charged with promoting a sex performance of a child under age 17, possessing an obscene sexual performance by a child, and possessing a sexual performance by a child, according to prosecutors. •Eduardo Salcedo Urzola, who was working as an au pair, was arrested in April at his Brooklyn home and charged with possession of child pornography under federal law. Prosecutors said agents identified an IP address at a residence associated with him that made known images and movies of child pornography available for distribution. •Aaron Young, a paramedic with the Fire Department of New York, was arrested in Queens in April and charged with possession of child pornography.  Agents identified an IP address at Young's residence that made known images and movies of child pornography available for distribution. •Yong Wu, an NYPD officer, was arrested in April in Queens and charged with possession of child pornography under state law. Prosecutors said Wu made known images and movies of child pornography available for distribution. •Jonathan Silber, a Boy Scout den master and Little League coach, was arrested at his residence in upstate New York and charged under state law with possession of child pornography. Silber allegedly made known images and movies of child pornography available for distribution via his computer, prosecutors said. Lawyers for the defendants were not immediately available for comment.

"Seven Marines were killed in an explosion during a Marine Corps training exercise at Hawthorne Army Depot in western Nevada, the Marine Corps said Tuesday. Eight others were injured. The cause of the Monday night blast was a 60 mm round that detonated inside a mortar tube, Brig. Gen. James W. Lukeman, commanding general of the 2nd Marine Division, told reporters. The Marines said in a statement Tuesday evening that all 60 mm mortar rounds and tubes used to fire them are being pulled pending an investigation. One Marine and one sailor suffered very serious injuries, and four Marines are in serious condition, the service said in a news release. Another Marine was treated and released. One Marine suffered minor injuries, but it is unclear whether that individual was hospitalized. ""Let me say to the families of our Marines and sailors that our hearts go out to you,"" said the general, whose division is based at Camp Lejeune in North Carolina. ""We appreciate your sacrifice, and we'll do all that we can to continue to support you."" The Marines will release the names of the deceased 24 hours after their relatives have been notified. Lukeman wouldn't give any details about which Marine unit was involved but said it was involved into a mountain training exercise that involved live ammunition. Marines had been training at Hawthorne and the nearby Marine mountain warfare training center in Bridgeport, California, for about a month. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, who represents Nevada, called it ""quite a big explosion"" and said the area of the blast was cordoned off as details emerged. ""We don't know exactly what happened, but it was a violent explosion, we know that,"" he said. ""Our thoughts are with those who were injured and, of course, the families of those who lost loved ones."" Hawthorne Army Depot, about 140 miles southeast of Reno, is used for storing ammunition and weapon stocks awaiting demilitarization. The facility also provides high desert training facilities for military units. KOLO: Seven Marines dead in Hawthorne explosion . President Barack Obama was immediately made aware of the incident, and the White House was monitoring the situation, spokesman Jay Carney said. ""We are obviously in the early stages of assessing the incident,"" he said. ""It is a tragedy, clearly.""","Marines say two people suffered very serious wounds .

"Eating and cooking one's way through a country is one of the best ways to understand and enjoy a culture. The raw ingredients, finished dishes and smells, tastes and traditions in between meld into unforgettable sensory experiences. Tour operators are offering an increasing number of trips that cater to their guests' desire to taste -- and cook -- their way through a destination. These newer excursions go far beyond familiar gastronomic pilgrimages to Tuscany. Hungry globetrotters are keen to visit goat-cheese producers in Iceland, with the likes of food writer and chef Jody Eddy; sample street food in Vietnam on a trip with Artisans of Leisure; or press their own olive oil in Egypt during a journey with Backpacker Concierge. Our list highlights some of the very best culinary tours around, all of which prove that travel has never tasted so good. Artisans of Leisure, Vietnam . After the S-shape curve of the country from north to south, Artisans of Leisure's private, custom Vietnam for Foodies tours take in cultural and gustatory attractions along the way. Trips start in Hanoi, where guests explore the city's famed markets, colonial architecture, historical sites and French-influenced restaurants. Next they hop on a traditional junk for a sail across Halong Bay, whose waters teem with prawns, oysters, squid and snapper that are staples of the local cuisine. Visits to the former imperial city of Hue, a vegetarian Buddhist monastery and the herb farms around Hoi An follow (participants pick lemongrass, basil and cilantro and use them to make fresh spring rolls). Departures: A taste of ancient Greek food . The final stop, in Ho Chi Minh City (formerly Saigon), includes chef-led cooking classes and a street-food tour -- and boundless opportunities for trying snacks such as banh mi (sandwiches), pho (spicy noodle soup), goi du du (green papaya salad) and banh xeo (rice pancakes with pork and shrimp). Eleven-day trips by appointment, from $6,810; 800-214-8144. Austin-Lehman Adventures, Athens and the Cyclades . Travelers who envision Greece as a never-ending series of secluded beaches, ancient ruins and whitewashed fishing villages won't be disappointed here. The weeklong itinerary manages to fold in all the can't-miss sights: the Parthenon in Athens, the sparkling shores of Santorini, the cerulean lagoons of Antiparos and the ever-photogenic sugar-cube buildings of Mykonos. But it also provides an in-depth appreciation for the food and flavors of the region. Guests make visits to groves and farms where they can sample honey, olive oil, feta and graviera (a sheep's-milk cheese). Departures: Top 'how to' vacations . They also take cooking classes -- sometimes in the island homes of local chefs -- and learn to prepare local dishes such as revythada (slow-cooked chickpea stew), domatokeftedes (tomato fritters) and tsipoura (fresh-caught sea bream). eight-day trips (May-October departures), from $5,298; 800-575-1540. Backpacker Concierge, Egypt . Daydreams of an Egyptian holiday usually include lots of stock imagery: the soaring pyramids and Great Sphinx at Giza; the riotous, colorful crowds of the market stalls at Cairo's Khan al Khalili. But until recently most travelers haven't wondered much about the flavors of this desert country -- a situation Backpacker Concierge aims to change with its new bespoke culinary excursions there. Departures: World's top tasting menus . While guests on the tours can see all the quintessential Egyptian sights, they also partake in some truly unusual gastronomic experiences, including touring the country's little-known northern wineries; learning to make Egyptian specialties such as mahshy (stuffed zucchini and cabbage leaves) and duqqa (roasted ground hazelnuts and spices) in a chef's home kitchen; and, in the remote village of Siwa, pressing olive oil and making date honey by hand. Seven-day trips by appointment, from $1,700; 248-507-4666. Caribbean Culinary Tours, Jamaica . Though they are one of the closest holiday destinations for North Americans, the Caribbean islands are home to a singularly vivid and eclectic cuisine. And while many island nations here have their own particular culinary traditions, perhaps none is as distinctive as Jamaica's -- a blend of African, European and Asian influences that gave birth to such signature preparations as jerk-spiced meat and fish, ackee and saltfish, curried goat and festival (deep-fried bread balls). Departures: American chocolate tours . It takes an islander to help visitors properly navigate this gastronomic landscape, and Dominican-born chef Freda Gore does just that by leading her Caribbean Culinary Tours cooking seminars, guiding trips to roadside farmers' stalls, restaurants and rum distilleries and -- in between -- allowing for downtime for sunning, snorkeling and cocktails. April 12-18, from $2,999; 615-609-5421. Epitourean, Lima and Machu Picchu, Peru . A Peruvian tasting tour capped off by a trek to the most dazzling UNESCO World Heritage site on the South American continent? A traveler would need to be scared of heights -- or ceviche -- to pass it up. Epitourean's itinerary provides an array of food-related experiences, including cooking classes -- which teach the finer points of wild-boar carapulcra (stew) and morada (shredded chicken with purple potato and aji amarillo) -- and trips to markets, pisco taverns in Lima and street-food stalls in Cusco. In between gastronomic adventures, however, there is plenty of time to visit historic cathedrals, museums and Incan ruins, the most spectacular of which is, of course, the ancient high-altitude site of Machu Picchu, the figurative and literal peak of the tour. Ten-day trips by appointment, from $3,690; 800-390-3292. Jody Eddy, Iceland . Food writer and chef Jody Eddy, whose cooking resume includes stints at Jean-Georges and Tabla in New York, teamed with Icelandic chef Kjartan Gislason to put together this new culinary adventure for August. Trip participants will enjoy Iceland's breathtaking natural landscapes, soaking in mountain-ringed geothermal pools, hiking alongside thundering waterfalls and sailing to remote north-coast islands. Departures: Most bikeable wine regions . In between, they will visit with growers and producers of distinctly Icelandic products such as smoked arctic char, skyr (a tangy local yogurt), sweet rye bread, reindeer carpaccio and liqueurs made with rhubarb, birch and caraway. Guests will also get demonstrations from and take meals with some of the country's most celebrated chefs, including Gunnar Karl Gislason, whose Reykjavik restaurant Dill (dillrestaurant.is) set the bar for modern Icelandic cuisine. August 16-23, from $3,900. TripFeast, Thailand . Many travelers know Thailand as a street-food paradise, and rightly so. One could easily spend months trolling Bangkok's wok-wielding vendors and snacking on oyster omelets, spicy noodles and barbecued squid. With its Gourmet Thailand tour, however, TripFeast brings guests far beyond the street carts. The Bangkok-based itinerary is built around classes at some of the country's best cooking schools, where refined dishes such as pla goong (spicy prawn salad with Thai herbs) are learned. Guests explore the famous Damnoen Saduak Floating Market and take trips to mussel farms, fishing villages and even a tropical-climate winery along the western edge of the Bay of Bangkok. Visits to Buddhist temples, tuk tuk rides and a night tour of Bangkok's vibrant Chinatown are also on the itinerary. Eight-day trips (March and November  departures), from $2,075; 347-380-6959.","Pick lemongrass, basil and cilantro and use them to make fresh spring rolls in Vietnam .

"Two girls in Florida, 14 and 12, have been arrested and charged with aggravated stalking -- cyberbullying. They allegedly tormented a 12-year-old girl named Rebecca so relentlessly that last month, Rebecca leapt to her death from a tower in an abandoned concrete plant. The arrest came after the following post was made on the 14-year-old's Facebook account: ""Yes IK I bullied REBECCA nd she killed herself but IDGAF."" Polk County Sheriff Grady Judd said he would charge the parents if he could, but there were no ""obvious charges"" against them. Before filing charges against the girls, Judd asked the parents to bring the girls in for questioning. They refused. If a teenager makes Facebook posts about the suicide of the girl she allegedly bullied, the parents might argue that they have no effective way to monitor or curtail her online behavior. They could say they don't know what she's doing, and they don't care. Mother of girl accused of bullying Florida teen arrested on unrelated charges . The question is this: Is ignorance and apathy about a child's cyberbullying criminal? Under our current laws, it looks like the answer is no. But in a case such as this, should willful blindness or gross negligence be criminal? I think they should, and here's why: If a child kills someone while operating a parent's car, the parents can be held responsible. If a child kills someone while using a parent's gun, the parent can be held responsible. If a child breaks the law using a computer or cell phone provided by the parent, how is that different? Parents need to understand that the technology they give to their children can be used to break the law and inflict harm. Parents need to understand that allowing their children the privilege of going online comes with responsibility and liability. The father of the 14-year-old girl in this case spoke to CNN's Chris Cuomo and said he regularly checks his daughter's Facebook account.  He said his daughter was asleep when the Facebook post was made, and he suspects the account was hacked. When asked about other online services used by the daughter, Kik and Ask.fm, the parents indicated they had not heard of them. Most of today's parents would be astonished by their children's online behavior. But they shouldn't be. Just because today's parents didn't grow up with social media doesn't mean they can be forgiven for not knowing about it. The Internet is a portal to a boundless virtual world. It offers enormous opportunities for social interaction, and I'd suspect most tweens and teenagers would argue it is crucial to their socialization experience. If they're not online, they're missing out. Parents, beware of bullying on sites you've never seen . That means it is fertile grounds for those who wish to harass, antagonize or bully. And it's a place where they can inflict emotional injury in a detached, almost anonymous way -- a coward's way. If parents are not going to assume responsibility for their children's online access on their own -- and it seems like the parents in this case are not -- then I would support legislation that places legal responsibility on parents, making them liable for what the children do with the online access parents provide. I am drafting a bill that would give Judd and other sheriffs the ""obvious charges"" needed to hold parents accountable. I do not think we should enact knee-jerk legislation because of a singular event, but this is not a singular event. I'm thinking about the Steubenville rape case, where teenage boys felt it was OK to post photos showing abuse of a teenage girl online. I'm thinking about the case of a former NFL player who discovered 300 teens were vandalizing his home because they were posting on social media while they did it. Where are the parents? I understand there are substantial obstacles in the way of passing such legislation.  Once upon a time, I worked for the Florida House Governmental Operations Committee, and I learned how to draft a bill that can pass constitutional muster and which addresses urgent matters in a balanced way. While it is a straightforward process to hold a parent responsible when a child uses a dangerous object such as a gun, it's more difficult in the case of a nondangerous device such as a cell phone or a computer. Moreover, holding a parent liable requires proof that they had knowledge of the activity, or at least were grossly negligent in their parental responsibilities, and we have to recognize that teenagers can find ways to avoid detection. In this context, a parent could be grossly negligent by having absolutely no supervision of child's Internet presence (just like leaving a kid in a hot car, or playing on a busy street), or if a parent was notified of potential problems with Internet presence by a complaining parent or a school official or cop, and then failed to do anything to address it.. Finally, there are constitutional due-process concerns with holding a third party liable for criminal acts, especially when a statute already exists to hold the child criminally liable. In the wake of this suicide, Judd has implored parents to take more responsibility for their children's online behavior. If parents won't adopt that responsibility, we need to hold their feet to the fire and insist they share liability, especially when their children's actions have life or death consequences. Social media has entered the ""Wild West"" phase.  It's been unregulated so far because it's fallen outside the view of our lawmakers. Nonetheless, we are seeing example after example of people using social media for nefarious purposes. Cyberbullying is an undeniable problem, and we should not be satisfied with just asking kids to ""toughen up and take it."" I believe that kids have a right to some sense of safety and security, and that is threatened by cyberbullying. It's up to parents to protect their kids, and if they don't know how to, maybe some legislation holding them liable if they don't will provide the needed motivation for them to get involved in their kids' online lives. This issue is urgent and critical, and we need to act before we lose another child.","Mark O'Mara: Two Florida girls charged with cyberbullying of 12-year-old who committed suicide .

"Hundreds of students and youth organizers were arrested outside the White House Sunday as they protested against the Keystone XL pipeline under review by the Obama administration. Some demonstrators zip-tied their hands to the White House fence, and others acted out a ""human oil spill,"" lying on black tarps in front of the White House. Nearly a thousand students began their march at Georgetown University and proceeded to the outside of Secretary of State John Kerry's Washington home, where they created a smaller human oil spill. Marchers then headed to Lafayette Square for a rally. Afterward, around a third of the crowd then peacefully moved to the White House fence. Participants said they hoped that a strong statement from younger voters would further pressure President Barack Obama to reject the project. ""(This is) a youth-organized action to tell President Obama to reject the Keystone Pipeline,"" said Nick Stracco, who participated in XL Dissent, the name of the rally. ""Because the youth vote was a crucial part in both of his elections, we know that we elected him and we voted for a climate champion, not another pipeline president."" The $5.3 billion pipeline, which would begin in northern Hardisty, Alberta, would transport tar sands oil over 1,179 miles through Saskatchewan, Montana, South Dakota and Nebraska to connect with existing segments in Kansas, Oklahoma and Texas. Once completed, it would carry 830,000 barrels a day to Houston and Port Arthur on the Gulf Coast. Proponents of the pipeline point to the thousands of potential jobs that could result from its construction. Environmental groups oppose the pipeline because extracting and refining the tar sands oil emits 17% more of the carbon pollution that contributes to climate change than conventional oil production. Environmental advocates also say projects like the pipeline reinforce U.S. dependence on fossil fuels rather than encourage green technologies. The project by TransCanada still needs federal approval because the pipeline would cross an international border. The State Department released an environmental report on the pipeline January 31. The public now has 90-day period for public comment and consultation. Stracco expressed considerable skepticism about the report. ""The report that came out of the State Department is as dirty as the pipeline itself,"" he said. ""Any suggestion that an 800,000 barrel a day oil sands pipeline will not contribute to climate change is incorrect."" Kerry, who is known for his effort to combat climate change, will determine if the pipeline project is in the national interest and make a recommendation to Obama. The final call rests with the President.","Young protesters created ""human oil spill,"" zip-tied themselves to White House fence .

"He's only 3 years old, but Landon Riddle is already the focus of a medical marijuana fight in Colorado. Landon has acute lymphocytic leukemia, or ALL, a cancer of the blood and bone marrow.  It's the most common cancer in children. His mother says his condition has improved so much following treatment with medical marijuana that chemotherapy isn't needed. But the Children's Hospital of Colorado, she says, disagreed. It all started back in September 2012.  Landon, then 2, was living with his mother, Sierra Riddle, in St. George, Utah, when he developed a sore throat and swollen lymph nodes. The emergency room doctor said it was a virus and sent him home. Two days later he went back. His armpits were swollen. ""They thought it was either a virus or infection in the lymph nodes, so they gave him some antibiotics,"" Sierra Riddle says. But on the fifth day, his mother says she was changing his diaper and noticed his groin was also swollen, as well as his abdomen and throat. He was having trouble breathing. That time, she got a frightening diagnosis: cancer. New York governor announces plan for medical marijuana at hospitals . Landon was flown to a children's hospital in Salt Lake City. ""His whole chest was full of leukemia tumors, which is why he couldn't breathe,"" his mother says. ""They started him on chemo, but told us that he probably wasn't going to make it."" Landon's cancer had quickly progressed, leading doctors to give him an 8% chance of survival, she says. In general, ALL is one of the most curable cancers.  According to the American Cancer Society, more than 90% of children diagnosed with the disease survive. Chemotherapy is the standard treatment, and Riddle says doctors put Landon on a four-year treatment plan. The first two months of chemo went fairly well, but then Landon became extremely ill. ""Most days he couldn't get off the couch,"" Riddle remembers. ""He would just lay there and throw up and throw up."" Riddle says he also developed neuropathy -- a symptom of nerve damage that can cause weakness, numbness and pain -- in his legs that left him barely able to walk. Around that time, a friend set up a Facebook page called Offer Hope for Landon, and recommendations started streaming in, including several endorsing cannabis -- medical marijuana -- as a treatment. Medical marijuana, however, isn't legal in Utah. Still, desperate for answers, Sierra Riddle and her mother, Wendy Riddle, started looking into it. They considered going to California or Oregon. Then their research led them to the Stanley brothers in Colorado. The six brothers are one of that state's biggest cannabis growers and dispensary owners. The Stanleys produce about 500 pounds of medical marijuana a year.  At the time, much of it was high in THC -- tetrahydrocannabinol, the psychoactive ingredient in pot that gets users high but also helps patients with an array of conditions including pain and nausea. But the Stanleys were also growing something quite revolutionary: a plant cross-bred to reduce the THC and increase another compound found in cannabis called cannabidiol, or CBD. Many researchers believe CBD is one of the compounds in marijuana that has medicinal benefits. According to the National Cancer Institute, it's thought to have significant analgesic, anti-inflammatory and anti-tumor activity without the psychoactive effect. The Stanleys expect to produce over 1,000 pounds this year, most of it the cross-bred variety, according to Joel Stanley. Dr. Sanjay Gupta: Why I changed my mind on weed . Riddle, herself a recovering heroin addict, struggled with the idea of giving Landon marijuana. ""I was telling my mom, you know, 'We really need to think about this.'"" But, says Riddle, her son was already prescribed medications like OxyContin and morphine -- medications with significant side effects. Landon suffered from stomach failure, and ""the OxyContin made him so miserable, when he had hair, he would literally try to pull his hair out."" In the end, she decided she had nothing else to lose and moved to Colorado. She rented a room, got Landon's medical marijuana card and began giving him marijuana -- THC for the pain and nausea, but also CBD. The dose was based on Landon's weight. He first took it in oil form, but now takes a pill. Once the doses started, ""Landon's (red and white blood cell) counts increased dramatically,"" she says. Six months later, encouraged by Landon's progress, she stopped his chemotherapy treatments completely. ""Once I took the chemo out, I see these amazing results. And no more need for blood transfusion and platelet transfusions,"" Riddle says. ""I think that the chemo in combination with the cannabis did put him into remission and now the cannabis will keep him there."" But Landon's doctor at the Children's Hospital of Colorado was shocked. ""She told me with no uncertainty that if I refused chemo, she would have no choice but to report me to the proper authorities,"" Riddle says. So Riddle found a lawyer willing to take her case. ""Nobody wants to hurt Landon here,"" says attorney Warren Edson. ""This is about making him better.  We have no problem making sure he's monitored throughout this process.  And again, if there's any indication this is doing him harm, I can't imagine Sierra doing anything other than the right thing."" Medical marijuana helps stem 6-year-old's seizures . Children's Hospital Colorado, in a statement, says it is ""committed to protecting the well-being of our patients."" The hospital says it cannot discuss specific cases, but provided information from Dr. Stephen Hunger, director of the hospital's Center for Cancer and Blood Disorders. Hunger noted that childhood cancer remains the leading cause of death by disease among American children; that about 25% of childhood cancers are ALL; and that the survival rate for children with ALL treated by Children's Oncology Group research trials is over 90%, attained with two to three years of chemotherapy. Children's Hospital Colorado is ""one of the largest centers in the country that treats children with ALL,"" the statement says. ""The Center for Cancer and Blood Disorders at Children's Hospital Colorado has always done its best to work closely with families to provide the most appropriate treatment for cancer, while also seeking to minimize side effects and maximize quality of life. ""Today, chemotherapy is a required part of therapy for children with leukemia. Many supportive care medications are used in children and adults with cancer, including those considered to be complementary and alternative medicine (also referred to as integrative health). ""Marijuana or a product derived from marijuana is often used to decrease side effects in adults with cancer,"" the hospital says. ""There are several FDA-approved and commercially available anti-nausea medicines derived from marijuana (cannabinoids) that are frequently used by adults and children with cancer, and we often prescribe these medications."" In an effort to stave off a legal wrangle, Riddle, her mother and Edson met with the doctors in charge of Landon's care in October. ""They said they were willing to work with us. They said they were willing to alter the chemo plan, and they did not,"" Riddle says. Child protective services -- which Riddle says had already been notified and visited the family's home -- was also at the meeting, along with Dr. Margaret Gedde, who wrote Landon's original prescription for marijuana and is monitoring his care. ""I could see a large gulf between the doctors who were making the point this is a fatal disease -- 'You know, he needs this treatment to survive,' and pretty much that was their stance,"" says Gedde. ""The family wanted to discuss more alternative modes of treatment and really things that wouldn't make him so sick, but again, the doctors being convinced that really it had to be done the way that they were used to it (being done) -- that just made it very much really a confrontation there of two different mindsets. I felt sympathetic to both."" Child protection officials declined comment on the case. The American Cancer Society, meanwhile, cautions that cannabinoids have not been tested in humans to determine if they can lower cancer risk. ""There are many challenges with marijuana research as it relates to cancer,"" the organization says in a statement. ""While it shows promise for controlling cancer pain among some patients, there is still concern that marijuana may cause toxic side effects in some people and that the benefits of THC must be carefully weighed against its potential risks. There is no available scientific evidence from controlled studies in humans that cannabinoids can cure or treat cancer."" Is medical marijuana safe for children? For now, Landon is still in remission with no sign of recurrence. Still, Gedde is cautious and says she can't recommend cannabis over chemo. ""When you look at children who go through that same course of treatment and compare Landon to them, it seems like he's doing better than what would be expected,"" she says. ""I'm very hopeful and very encouraged that the CBD is probably having a beneficial effect for him, but I think we're still looking to have the disease course play out and find out. I think in cancer, you don't really know until later."" Meanwhile, Edson says child protection officials have not yet filed a case. ""We will continue to monitor Landon's health, make sure he's getting the proper blood tests and other checks to see what's going on with him healthwise,"" he says. In December, Sierra Riddle notified Landon's doctors that she plans to transfer his care. She's searching for a physician willing to work with her to reduce the amount of steroids and chemotherapy he takes. Wendy Riddle says they have no regrets and will continue to fight. ""It's not just fighting for Landon. It's not just about him, it's about all of the kids to come,"" she says.  ""When Landon is 15 years old and we talk about this, I want Landon to know that we did everything in our power to be compassionate in his care and to protect him.""","Landon Riddle has acute lymphocytic leukemia .

"Donetsk, Ukraine (CNN) -- The road isn't easy -- past shelling and eerie separatist checkpoints. But where it leads is harder still. Twelve days after MH17 was blown out of the sky, pieces of the plane remain here, but for days investigators haven't been able to reach the site. On Wednesday, efforts to get to the bottom of the deadly crash hit another roadblock, as Ukrainian officials warned of possible landmines near the site. The wreckage sits in tomb-like silence -- a monument to cruelty, to how 298 souls -- some shipped in parts, away on a separatist train -- have yet to find complete rest. There are flowers and a teddy bear on the ground, where strangers have tried to mourn. The crash site still reeks of jet fuel and the stench of decay. Shrapnel holes are visible in the cockpit's remains. In the hour a CNN team spent at the crash site Wednesday, there were no separatists, inspectors or Ukrainian soldiers there. Just distant smoke that explains why the inspectors' large convoy has not, for the fourth day running, arrived. Ukraine's National Security and Defense Council claimed Wednesday that ""terrorists"" -- the term it uses to describe rebels -- have set up firing positions and laid mines on the access road to the crash site of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17. The Ukrainian government and pro-Russian rebels are fighting over control of eastern Ukraine. Dutch investigators in Ukraine did not mention mines but announced Wednesday that unsafe conditions kept their contingent from visiting the crash site for the fourth straight day. CNN could not independently confirm the veracity of the statement by the Ukrainian officials, though CNN's team traveled to and from the debris field safely Wednesday. The dangers in the area make the work of international experts ""impossible,"" the Ukrainian defense council said. Workers with the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe made the same call and avoided traveling to the crash site Wednesday. Ertrugrul Apakan, chief monitor of the OSCE Special Monitoring Mission to Ukraine, said he would like to see a cease-fire between combatants so investigators can work. It was the fourth straight day the OSCE has joined the 50-strong team of Dutch and Australian investigators in declaring the region too dangerous to work in. Dutch investigators have yet to lay eyes on the wreckage or the human remains believed still to be strewn across the huge debris field near the town of Torez. CNN's team reported seeing three or four points of smoke from artillery fire. Because the area was militarized before the plane crash, it was not possible to know whether those firing positions were new. Some human remains could still be found at the crash site, as well as belongings from the victims scattered about. On the journey there, the CNN team -- which was traveling in just one car, as opposed to the convoy of dozens of vehicles that the investigators use -- saw only a small rebel presence on the road around the wreckage. U.S. and Ukrainian officials have said that a Russian-made missile system was used to shoot down MH17 from rebel territory on July 17. Russia and the rebels have disputed the allegations and blamed Ukraine for the crash. Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte asked Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko in a phone call Tuesday morning to halt the fighting around the crash site so that investigators can access it, Rutte spokesman Jean Fransman said. Ukraine foreign minister: The bitter lessons of MH17 . Russian isolation . There are echoes of the Cold War as pro-Russian rebels battle Ukrainian government forces in the nation's east. With new sanctions announced by the European Union and United States against Russia this week, the stakes are getting higher, and Moscow is getting more isolated. A senior administration official said Russia hasn't been this isolated ""since the end of the Cold War."" The Russian Foreign Ministry said the latest round of U.S. sanctions ""will cause nothing but the harm"" to U.S.-Russian ties and ""will create a poor environment in international affairs where the cooperation between our countries often plays a key role."" The Russian response accused the United States of ""trying to avoid responsibility"" for the crisis in Ukraine and blamed the Ukrainian government for the violence in the east. On Wednesday, Russian lawmaker Aleksey Pushkov, the head of the State Duma's foreign affairs committee, said via Twitter that U.S. President Barack Obama ""will make history not as a peacekeeper, everyone forgot about his Nobel Prize, but as the statesman who started a new cold war."" But Obama downplayed the comparison Tuesday. ""It's not a new Cold War,"" he said. ""What it is is a very specific issue related to Russia's unwillingness to recognize that Ukraine can chart its own path."" The new and harder-hitting sanctions show the West's waning patience with Russia over its disputed annexation of Crimea, its support of pro-Russian rebels and the impact of the shoot-down of Flight 17, which had many Europeans among the 298 people on board when it went down in eastern Ukraine. The new EU sanctions aim to target eight ""cronies"" of Putin and three ""entities"" by limiting their access to EU capital markets, an EU official said on condition of anonymity. Entities facing sanctions, according to the European Union, include the Russian National Commercial Bank; the state-owned Almaz-Antey corporation, which manufactures anti-aircraft weaponry; and Dobrolet, a subsidiary of a Russian state-owned airline. Three state-owned banks were named Tuesday by Washington, meaning five of the top six financial institutions in Russia were on the sanctions list, according to a senior Obama administration official. Furthermore, the United States went to NATO with a claim that Russia has violated its obligations under the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty. The treaty prohibits that possession, production or flight-test of a ground-launched cruise missile with a range of 500 to 5,500 kilometers. In a statement, NATO asked Russia to resolve the issue. To punish Russia, Europe must be prepared to suffer . A parental quest . Although heavy fighting has blocked investigators from getting to the crash site, it didn't stop the determined parents of one of the victims. George and Angela Dyczynski braved the regional conflict and saw the wreckage over the weekend. ""We have been always protected,"" George Dyczynski said. ""I believe it was divine guidance."" ""We really, really promised our daughter that we will go there and that we tried to really fulfill our promises,"" said Angela Dyczynski. Despite there being no known survivors, the couple holds out hope that their daughter, Fatima, a 25-year-old aerospace engineer, is still alive. ""Fatima can only be pronounced dead when the DNA is matched with her body,"" Angela Dyczynski said. ""So if anybody says at the moment she is dead ... it's not correct."" Up to this point, very few of the bodies recovered from the crash have been identified by Dutch authorities. As of Monday, 227 coffins had been sent to the Netherlands, where forensic investigators are working to identify victims. It is unclear how many complete sets of bodies the coffins contain. How rebels built up an arsenal capable of reaching the skies . What will MH17 crash investigators find at site? U.S., EU coordinate on Russia sanctions, but will they work? CNN's Nick Paton Walsh reported from Donetsk; Ed Payne and Mariano Castillo wrote and reported in Atlanta. CNN's Catherine E. Shoichet, Michaela Pereira, Laura Smith-Spark, Steve Almasy, Lindsay Isaac, Ivan Watson, Barbara Starr, Michael Pearson, Susannah Palk, Alexander Felton, Mick Krever and Laura Bernardini and journalist Victoria Butenko in Kiev contributed to this report.","NEW: A CNN team visits the crash site, where wreckage sits in tomb-like silence .

"Helping families build homes was a job that Jessica Vu excelled at. As a sales consultant in Bellbrook, Ohio, she walked people through buying homes, selecting floor plans and customizing everything from doors and windows to counters. Then the housing market crashed in 2008, and she was laid off while she was eight weeks pregnant with her first child. Like many Americans who lost their income sources when employers cut more than 1.2 million jobs in the first 10 months of 2008, she struggled to find her footing. As the ripple effects of the recession continue, with monthly unemployment claims up in July, people like Vu are seeking alternatives to traditional office jobs and gambling on their passions. For Vu, that meant learning how to transform her childhood zeal for baking into profits. ""I wanted to know how to take what I loved doing and make it into a job,"" the 35-year-old mother of two said. ""I was good at working in the housing market, and it was good to us. But being a baker, I am so much more creative now."" Vu thought she would go back into construction sales, but no jobs materialized. Instead, she divided her time among caring for her young children, baking and budgeting household expenses on a single income. Amid the Excel spreadsheets and extreme couponing, she wondered what would come next. To save money on holiday gifts, she started baking biscotti and realized she loved the process of creating the traditional Italian pastry, from dreaming up flavor combinations to kneading dough. She never thought baking biscotti was something she could actually do as a career. But looking back on her old job, she realizes it didn't stimulate her creative impulses like baking does. ""Every day at my current job, I am being challenged and inspired,"" she said. ""When raspberries come into season, I might start thinking of new recipes. My wheels are always turning, and that is what I love."" A business without a storefront . Vu has been baking since she could climb onto a kitchen stool. Her fondest memories from childhood are sitting in her mother's kitchen, watching her pipe out elaborate icing designs onto towering wedding cakes and cookies. Whipping up pumpkin chocolate bread for friends was easy for Vu. But she thought she couldn't have a successful business without a brick and mortar store. When she started to calculate the cost of opening a kitchen and storefront, the price added up. ""How do people do this on their own?"" She wondered while visiting farmers' markets. A simple Google search for ""how to bake out of your own home"" led her to an intriguing alternative: cottage bakeries, in which people cook, grow or make things in their homes to sell to consumers. But it didn't take long for her to discover that there was a lot of research, paperwork and technicalities involved. Each state has its own laws for cottage food operations (PDF). Vu researched the rules and regulations of cottage bakery laws (PDF), taking out an insurance policy and a limited liability company certificate. Then, she realized she needed customers. Her biscotti were already receiving praise from friends and family. That encouraged her to drop off three flavors at Dorothy Lane Market Store, a Dayton gourmet grocer, during a manager's meeting in January. Within hours, she had her first order. Since then, she has rolled them out to all three of Dorothy Lane's in-store bakeries. Since her first order in January, Vu's business and confidence have grown. She secured a spot at her local farmers' market and launched her business under the name Bites of Nostalgia. Her biscotti were even featured on the dessert menu at the Wine Gallery, an upscale restaurant in downtown Dayton. Finding a niche . She attributes her success to finding a niche market. Most biscotti sold in stores are made in factories that produce the same typical flavors, like traditional Italian almond, anise, orange and pignoli. ""Surprisingly enough, there is little biscotti out there in bakeries,"" she said. ""So it wasn't that hard to break into."" Vu came up with five flavors based on combinations that play on popular culinary trends, like sweet and savory. One of her best-sellers, chocolate-caramel pretzel, was inspired by her husband, who challenged her to re-create his favorite candy, salted caramel. For those who like to stick with tradition, she has a lemon poppy seed, a cranberry pistachio and a classic Italian almond-anise flavor. With a recent order of 600 biscotti cookies for a wedding, Vu says, she is creating her own American dream. For years, her friends and family worked at and retired from the same companies. ""But for my generation, things are different,"" she said. ""Life can be in stages."" For those in a new stage of life right now, Vu recommends doing what she tells herself each day: just keep looking forward. And if it's not the plan you came up with right out of college -- or even before college -- don't be scared. ""Sometimes, we get it wrong,"" she said. ""And sometimes, you need to branch out if what you are doing isn't inspiring you.""","After losing job in 2008, Jessica Vu transformed passion for baking biscotti into business .

"Musician JJ Cale, whose songs ""Cocaine"" and ""After Midnight"" were made famous by Eric Clapton, died Friday night after suffering a heart attack, the president of his management agency said. His contemporaries considered him a legend, even if many fans weren't familiar with his name. He was 74. ""JJ Cale was loved by fans worldwide for his completely unpretentious and beautiful music,"" said Mike Kappus, president of the Rosebud Agency. ""He was loved even more dearly by all those he came in contact with as the most real and down-to-earth person we all knew."" 'Cocaine's' Cale makes his own groove . Lynyrd Skynyrd made Cale's song ""Call Me The Breeze"" famous, and bands including Santana, The Allman Brothers, Johnny Cash, and many others covered his songs. He won a Grammy for his 2006 album with Clapton, called ""The Road to Escondido."" ""He was incredibly humble and avoided the spotlight at all costs but will be missed by anyone touched by him directly or indirectly,"" Kappus said. ""Luckily, his music lives on."" The singer-songwriter passed away at Scripps Memorial Hospital in La Jolla, his official website said. There were no immediate plans for funeral services, it said. ""We've lost a great artist and a great person,"" Clapton wrote on his Facebook page. His official biography describes Cale as someone for whom music is all he's ever known. ""I remember when I made my first album, I was 32 or 33 years old and I thought I was way too old then,"" Cale said, according to his bio. ""When I see myself doing this at 70, I go, 'What am I doing, I should be layin' down in a hammock.'"" He was living in Tulsa and had given up on making money in the record business when his career was suddenly made by Clapton's cover of ""After Midnight."" That moment changed everything for the musician, his biography states. After Clapton picked up his song, Cale drove to Nashville to record his first album. He is credited with helping create what is known as the Tulsa Sound, a laid-back style that contrasted with the psychedelic rock that was heard at the time. ""I'm so old, I can remember before rock 'n' roll come along,"" Cale told CNN in 2009. ""When I was a young fellow, I played guitar for other people, so I'd have to learn (cover tunes). ... So the guitar players on all those early recordings, I guess, influenced what I did. I never could get it exactly right the way they played it, and I guess that helped the style that evolved."" Other musicians who covered Cale's work include The Band, Chet Atkins, Freddie King, Maria Muldaur and Captain Beefheart, according to his biography, which also notes he was asked whether it bothered him that fellow musicians considered him a legend while many fans did not even know his name. ""No, it doesn't bother me,"" Cale said. ""What's really nice is when you get a check in the mail."" People we've lost in 2013: The lives they lived .","Eric Clapton laments JJ Cale's passing .

"For such a small country -- it ranks 109th in the world for total area, right behind Iceland -- South Korea sure is in the news a lot. Occasionally that news is grim -- something to do with a troublesome cousin across the border. Sometimes it's pure mainstream pop -- a bunch of cute singers taking down Lady Gaga on the world stage. Sometimes it's just plain astonishing -- no one throws out the first pitch at a baseball game with as much panache as South Koreans. From the weird to the wonderful to sci-fi stuff from a Samsung galaxy far, far away, here are things South Korea pulls off more spectacularly than anywhere else.

While Americans made 77.9 credit card transactions per person in 2011 and Canadians made 89.6, South Koreans made 129.7.

According to this quirky map from thedoghousediaries, Brazil sets the standard for FIFA World Cup titles and North Korea leads in ""censorship,"" but South Korea takes the crown for workaholics. You can see it in any Korean city, where lights in buildings blaze into the late hours as workers slave away. According to 2012 data from South Korea's Ministry of Strategy and Finance, South Koreans work 44.6 hours per week, compared with the OECD average of 32.8.

Right now, they're pushing ""hair shockers"" -- neon tints for hair -- and nail polish with real flowers in it. Just as Korean men are less wary of going under the plastic surgery knife (see point 10) than their foreign counterparts, they also snap up skincare products and, yes, even makeup, namely foundation in the form of BB cream. South Korea is by far the largest market for men's cosmetics, with Korean men buying a quarter of the world's men's cosmetics -- around $900 million a year, according to Euromonitor. More: Complete Korean cosmetics shopping guide . 6. Female golfers . The Economist posed a million-dollar question in 2013. ""Why are Korean women so good at golf?"" The rankings were staggering. Of the top 100 female golfers in the world, 38 were Korean. Of the current top 25, 9 are Korean (10 if you count Seoul-born Lydia Ko, who calls New Zealand home). Inbee Park, 25, is the second-ranked player in women's golf and was the youngest player to win the U.S. Women's Open. In January, Ko, 14, set the record for the youngest woman to ever win a professional golf tournament. Chalk it up to crazy Korean competitiveness or to the Tiger Mom/Dad theory (golfer Se-Ri Pak's father is infamous for making her sleep alone in a cemetery every night to steel her nerves), but the phenomenon certainly begs study. Widely thought to be a response to Korean domination of the sport, the U.S.-based LPGA passed a requirement in 2008 mandating that its members must learn to speak English, or face suspension. 7. Starcraft . One country's hopeless nerds are among another's highest earning celebrities. Starcraft is actually a legitimate career in South Korea, with pro gamers raking in hundreds of thousands of dollars in earnings in addition to endorsements. Since the game launched in 1998, nearly half of all games have been sold in South Korea, where boys, girls, men and women drop by for a night of gaming in giant video game parlors. There are cable channels devoted solely to the games, and the culture has led to approximately 14% of Koreans between ages 9 and 12 suffering from Internet addiction, according to the National Information Agency. To try to crack down, the government passed a ban dubbed the ""shutdown law"" or ""Cinderella law"" two years ago, prohibiting anyone 16 and younger from game websites.

The standard answer is the epic horror story that was the last blind date, often involving a crippling Oedipus complex or intolerable physical flaw. Followed immediately by a chirpy, ""Why, do you know someone you can set me up with?"" Due to the high volume of blind dates, when Korean make up their minds, they move quickly. According to data compiled by South Korea's largest matchmaking company, Duo, the average length of time of a relationship from the (blind) first date to marriage is approximately 10.2 months for working people, with an average of 62 dates per couple. In a survey conducted by Duo, working singles interested in marriage say they typically go on two blind dates a week. They should know.

""At the moment, I want to have them with me, but eventually I would like to make a book -- maybe a coffee table book. To do that, though, I need a big bag of money,"" he says. The Eversons, who wed inside a Concorde four years ago, make Muskiet's collection look tame. The couple, who met online and soon bonded over their shared love of plane paraphernalia, spent £40,000 ($67,000) converting their home in Lancashire, UK into a Boeing 737 airplane, complete with a flight simulator. ""The corridor used to be full of aircraft parts. We had to cut a door for the flight deck in the bathroom,"" admits Steve. The collection grew so big that the couple eventually had to outsource it to an office space down the street. They have since started charging fellow flight fanatics for the chance to try out the simulator (they dub it the Flight Deck Experience). ""We wanted people to feel like they were boarding a real aircraft. It adds to the whole experience,"" says Steve.","Cliff Muskiet loves stewardess uniforms. He's collected over 1,000 over the years.

"WILLIAMSBURG, Virginia (CNN) -- President Barack Obama said Thursday that ""the scale and the scope"" of his economic plan is right, turning up the heat on critics he said were hawking ""phony arguments"" and ""false theories of the past"" to chip away at the bill's programs. President Obama said if a stimulus bill isn't passed the economy will continue to get worse. ""Don't come to the table with the same tired arguments and worn ideas that helped to create this crisis,"" the president said at the House Democrats' annual retreat in Williamsburg. ""We're not going to get relief by turning back to the very same policies that, for the last eight years, doubled the national debt and threw our economy into a tailspin,"" he said. ""We can't embrace the losing formula that says only tax cuts will work for every problem we face, that ignores critical challenges like our addiction to foreign oil, or the soaring cost of health care, or failing schools and crumbling bridges and roads and levees. ""I don't care whether you're driving a hybrid or an SUV -- if you're headed for a cliff, you've got to change direction."" The Democrats welcomed the president with frequent interruptions for applause as he took on criticisms of the bill. Obama said he valued ""the constructive criticism and healthy debate that's taking place around this package,"" but added that speedy passage of the bill was essential. ""We're not moving quickly because we're trying to jam something down people's throats,"" he said. ""We're moving quickly because if we don't, the economy's going to keep getting worse."" Obama rejected calls for more tax cuts and significant slashing of the bill's more than $800 billion price tag, and said complaints the package was a spending bill rather than a stimulus bill were off base. ""What do you think a stimulus bill is?"" he said. ""That's the point."" To critics who argue that the government shouldn't be spending billions with a large and growing deficit, Obama said, ""I found this national debt doubled, wrapped in a big bow waiting for me as I stepped into the Oval Office."" The American people called for change in November, he said, ""and that's what we're going to deliver."" ""They did not send us here to get bogged down with the same old delay, the same old distractions, the same talking points, the same cable chatter,"" he said. ""They did not vote for the false theories of the past, and they didn't vote for phony arguments and petty politics, and they did not vote for the status quo."" Obama told his fellow Democrats that they have ""the capacity to do great things"" on behalf of the American people, ""but we are going to have to do it by not thinking about ourselves."" ""It starts with this economic recovery plan,"" he said. ""And soon, we will take on big issues like addressing the foreclosure problem, passing a budget, tackling our fiscal problems, fixing our financial regulation and securing our country."" But, he stressed, the battle over the stimulus bill is not ""an abstract debate."" ""If we do not move swiftly to sign [the act] into law, an economy that is already in crisis will be faced with catastrophe,"" he said. ""This is not my assessment. This is not Nancy Pelosi's assessment. This is the assessment of the best economists in the country. This is the assessment of some of the former advisers of some of the same folks who are making these criticisms right now."" ""This is not a game,"" he said. ""This is not a contest for who's in power and who's up and who's down."" It's time, he said, to ""set aside the gamesmanship in this town and get something done."" Behind closed doors after his speech, Obama fielded a handful of questions from House Democrats. Asked about Afghanistan, Obama pointed to a number of reviews under way -- including ones by his national security team and by the U.S. Central Command -- of U.S. strategy in Afghanistan. The United States cannot win there by military means alone, Obama said. He stressed the need to make sure that Afghanistan does not become a safe haven for terrorists. The president highlighted the importance of diplomatic efforts in Pakistan as well. On the subject of fiscal discipline, Obama referred to the economic stimulus package, getting credit going again so small businesses can get loans, stemming home foreclosures with next expenditure of the Troubled Assets Relief Program, and the executive compensation limits his administration set this week for businesses that accept taxpayer bailouts. Asked whether he would lift the ban on stem cell research, the president promised to sign an executive order to do so. Obama said he wants to coordinate with House and Senate leadership to craft an executive order - based on science, fact and reason -- strong enough to avoid a quick reversal. Obama's comments impressed Rep. Charlie Melancon, D-Louisiana. The president ""said he'd rather do what's right and serve one term than just do what's politically good and be a mediocre president and get to serve two terms,"" Melancon said. Melancon, a fiscal conservative, said he didn't support every program in the House bill. ""We couldn't explain some of them,"" he said. For instance, ""how does giving out condoms put people back to work?"" But Melancon criticized Republicans who focused on only a small fraction of the stimulus bill, calling it ""chump change."" He acknowledged that although a stimulus package might not work, he said Congress needs to act or risk ""total collapse"" of the economy. House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer of Maryland praised Republicans who voted with Democrats and said they showed true bipartisanship. But he railed against the Republican leadership, which told its members to vote against the original stimulus bill. ""Now they seem to be fired up and ready to say 'no,' Hoyer said. ""We hope that they will change their minds."" Republicans have blasted numerous measures in the $819 billion stimulus package that the House passed last week, such as funding for veterans in the Philippines and sod on the National Mall. Such provisions have nothing to do with stimulating the economy, Republicans say. Hoyer acknowledged a need for compromise on some points important to the Democrat leadership, but he declined to specify what he'd be willing to sacrifice to get the bill passed.

"August 15, 2014, marks the 100th anniversary of the first use of the Panama Canal: one of the greatest feats of engineering the world has ever seen. The Canal is 48 miles long, was 17 years in the making and had enough rock and rubble dug from the isthmus of Central America to circle the earth four times. But as awe-inspiring as the ""big ditch"" is, it's still only a tiny sliver of what Panama has to offer. Away from the commerce and concrete of the canal, the country is teeming with rain forests, beaches, indigenous people and colonial history. 1. Panama Canal . Tourist transits of the canal can be long and hot, but for the enthusiast nothing beats sharing water with an 80,000 ton cargo freighter. The best views, however, are from the four-story Miraflores Lock Visitor Center. Savvy trippers time visits with the transit of one of the big ships and make sure to stop by the museum and watch the 3D movie, afterward. If you've never been run over by a six-story ship before, now's your chance. Other highlights include visiting the still-in-construction $5.25 billion Panama Canal Expansion Observation Center, scheduled to open in 2015. Ancon Expeditions (+1 888 760 3426) has full- and partial-day transits of the canal from $175 per person . 2. Casco Viejo, Panama City . The orange-tiled roofs and Spanish colonial architecture of old town Panama City stand in slow contrast to the skyscraper skyline across the bay. But this is where the real action is. At night, Casco Viejo is just the right amount of edgy, with music pouring onto the street from every alley and corner. By day, it's perfect for drinking coffee at Plaza Bolivar, browsing the markets at Plaza de La Independencia and watching the sun set from the point above Plaza Francia, the best view in the city. 3. Bocas del Toro . Situated on the northwestern Caribbean coast, this archipelago of nine tropical islands has retained a strong West Indian influence. Eco-tourism and aqua adventure are key draws, with some of the best scuba diving and surf breaks in the country. A full-on castaway experience can be had on the outer islands, where deserted paradises, like that at Polo Beach on Bastimentos Island, are wild, undeveloped and easy to find. For more information see: www.bocasdeltoro.com . 4. Boquete . At the foothills of the Baru Volcano in the Chiriqui Highlands, the pretty mountain town of Boquete is a natural paradise. There's hiking, whitewater rafting and rock climbing right on the doorstep and 500 of Panama's 972 species of bird are found in the province, including the highly sought after Quetzal. The region is home to some of the best coffee growers in the world, including the most expensive brew on the planet, Cafe Geisha, at $1,600 a kilo, or $40 a cup. Cafe Ruiz has excellent guided tours of its coffee plantation. 5. Emberra Indians . There's no better way to understand Panama's indigenous roots than via dugout canoe up the Chagres River, where you'll pass thatch houses woven deep into the jungle before arriving at Emberra village, home to one of nine major indigenous groups in the country. You can watch performances of traditional dance and music, buy authentic, handcrafted souvenirs and learn about their culture. It's a magical, if somewhat well rehearsed, experience but worth it for the lunch of fresh spear-caught Tilapia alone. Ancon Expeditions (+1 888 760 3426) has a full-day tour to an Emberra village from $130 per person. 6. La Loma chocolate farm . Beautiful, wild and completely off the grid, La Loma is a working chocolate farm and probably the most delicious place to stay in the country. Based on the remote Bastimentos Island in Bocas del Toro, guests learn about all aspects of chocolate production while enjoying its harvest breakfast, lunch and dinner. Other highlights include rainforest trekking to beaches, paddling through the mangroves, and, for the brave, underground swimming in the utterly dark, and terrifying, Nivida cave. La Loma has tree house cabins from $110 per person per night, including all meals and many excursions. 7. Gatun Lake . To create the Panama Canal, the Chagres River was dammed and an area the size of Barbados flooded. The result is the artificial, but astonishingly wild, Gatun Lake. With a small boat cruise less than an hour from Panama City, it's possible to see capuchin monkeys, three-toed sloths and crocodiles. Because part of the lake is used by the canal, you'll also get a mini-tour of the waterway at the same time. Ancon Expeditions has a Gatun Lake rainforest adventure cruise from $170 per person. 8. Biodiversity Museum, Panama City . Opened June 2014 on the causeway of Panama City, the new Frank Gehry-designed Biomuseo is a jarringly bold, macaw-like building. Inside is one of the best natural history exhibitions you're likely to see. The highlight is a 12-screen, fully immersive, cinema in surround -- including one giant screen under foot. Monkeys scramble overhead, sharks swim under foot, visitors are lifted up and flown through a storm. 9. Portobello . In 1596, English buccaneer Sir Francis Drake met his grisly end against the Spanish cannons of Portobello. Their forts still remain. Visitors can soak up the pirate history, visit the church of San Felipe where the statue of the black Christ draws thousands of pilgrims each October 21 and grab lunch at El Palenque, an idyllic spot by the water's edge. For longer stays, there's El Oltro Lado on the other side of Portobello Bay; it's a hip boutique hotel with cool tunes, quirky art and an infinity pool. 10. Fish Market, Panama City . Cuquita Arias de Calvo, one of Panama's best known chefs, described her country's cuisine as ""joyful, happy and hot -- just like Panamanians."" Her restaurant, at the Bristol Hotel in Panama City's financial district, serves traditional Panamanian recipes with a modern twist. But the best place to eat in Panama City is still the fish market. There's a good restaurant upstairs that draws the tourists, but far tastier, and infinitely more memorable, are the crowded stalls below for freshly caught ceviche scooped up with crackers, spicy aji chomdo sauce and stadium decibel reggaeton. 11. San Blas Islands . Owned, operated and protected by the Kuna Indians, this archipelago of atolls off the northern coast of Panama, has a tropical island for every day of year, plus a few to spare (378 to be precise, 49 of which are inhabited). The beaches are deserted enough to satisfy even the most extreme Robinson Crusoe fantasies. But the highlight is the Kuna people themselves -- welcoming and proud of a culture that has changed little in centuries. Be prepared to slow down, fast. For more information visit www.sanblas-islands.com. Journey Latin America offers excellent tailor-made vacations to Panama, taking in all of these highlights and more.","The famous canal is just one reason to visit Panama.

"Modern-day peeping Toms in Massachusetts, the sorts who get their thrills snapping ""upskirt"" photos on crowded subways, now have their behavior criminalized. Gov. Deval Patrick signed a bill Friday, according to his office, making photographing or recording video under a person's clothing -- think down a blouse or up a skirt -- a misdemeanor. ""The legislation makes the secret photographing, videotaping, or electronically surveiling of another person's sexual or other intimate parts, whether under or around a person's clothing or when a reasonable person would believe that the person's intimate parts would not be visible to the public, a crime,"" Patrick's office said in a prepared statement. The crime is punishable by up 2½ years in jail or a fine of up to $5,000. In addition, the law states that ""whoever videotapes or photographs, with the intent to secretly conduct or hide such activity, the sexual or other intimate parts of a child"" faces a sentence of 2½ to 5 years and up to a $5,000 fine. The law goes into effect immediately. Victim of ""upskirting"" speaks out . Lawmakers hastily drew up and passed the bill Thursday, a day after the state's highest court ruled that current laws against secretly photographing a person in a state of partial nudity don't apply to these sorts of secretive shots. ""A female passenger on a MBTA (Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority) trolley who is wearing a skirt, dress, or the like covering these parts of her body is not a person who is 'partially nude,' no matter what is or is not underneath the skirt by way of underwear or other clothing,"" wrote Justice Margot Botsford of the state Supreme Judicial Court. The ruling stemmed from a case against Michael Robertson, 32, who was arrested in 2010. He was accused of using his cell phone to take pictures and record video up the skirts and dresses of women riding on the trolley, court documents say. Complaints were filed with transit police, who then staged ""a decoy operation"" to catch Robertson. He promptly pointed his phone up the dress of a female officer, court documents say. He was arrested and charged with two counts of attempting to secretly photograph a person in a state of partial nudity. Though a lower court ruled against him, Robertson found his case dismissed Wednesday -- and outraged lawmakers got to work. ""We are sending a message that to take a photo or video of a woman under her clothing is morally reprehensible and, in Massachusetts, we will put you in jail for doing it,"" state Senate President Therese Murray said in a prepared statement. ""We will need to revisit this law again and again as technology continues to evolve and ensure that we are providing the necessary protections."" Recognizing how technology plays a part in amplifying the violation is key, victim advocates say. The images can, in no time, make the international rounds online. ""I think there's a fear among people that you could have an 'upskirt' photo taken of you and never realize it,"" said Emily May, executive director of ihollaback.org, a website that encourages women to share their stories and cell phone photos of harassers. ""Your crotch could be on the Internet, and you may never know about it."" States -- and victims -- grapple with 'upskirt' laws against voyeurism .","Massachusetts governor signs ban on ""upskirting""

"(CNN) -- Party of no? When it comes to Supreme Court nominations, the GOP is a flock of baby lambs compared with their opposites on the Democratic side. The past two Democratic presidents have named three justices between them: Sonia Sotomayor, Stephen Breyer and Ruth Bader Ginsburg. All glided painlessly to confirmation. Compare that with the mayhem inflicted on Republican choices. Two of President Nixon's nominees were rejected by the Senate. Ditto for one of Ronald Reagan's choices (another withdrew shortly after he was nominated). One of President George H.W. Bush's choices, Clarence Thomas, was confirmed after a fight that still ranks as perhaps the most vicious in confirmation history. It's hard to argue that the difference is due to the superior quality of the Democratic choices. Ginsburg's views were and are at least as controversial as Robert Bork's. Not only Bork, but two other Republican nominees (Clement Haynsworth and Douglas Ginsburg) could show legal credentials that brightly outshone Sotomayor's. Nor is it just a matter of clout: Although Republicans lacked the votes to defeat Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Breyer and Sotomayor, they could have filibustered either of the first two. No, the difference is not in the nominees. It is in the parties. On judges, Republicans have played by softer rules than Democrats. There's no Republican equivalent of the notoriously scurrilous 1987 speech of Sen. Edward Kennedy's against Bork: . ""Robert Bork's America is a land in which women would be forced into back-alley abortions, blacks would sit at segregated lunch counters, rogue police could break down citizens' doors in midnight raids, schoolchildren could not be taught about evolution, writers and artists would be censored at the whim of government, and the doors of the federal courts would be shut on the fingers of millions of citizens for whom the judiciary is often the only protector of the individual rights that are the heart of our democracy."" It's not as if Republicans do not know how to play rough when they wish to do so. But on judges, Republicans have not wished to play rough. Why not? Republicans have won seven of the 11 presidential elections since 1968. Over those same years, Republican presidents made a total of 11 appointments to the high court, with the nominees becoming steadily more conservative over time. Democrats fought back, using every weapon at hand, including the very nasty weapons deployed against Bork and Thomas. And Republicans counterattacked, by emphasizing the legitimate right of election winners to choose judges who reflected majority values. There's an old saying: ""Where you stand depends on where you sit."" It's also true however that parties take some time to realize that they are sitting in a new place. The Republican senators who deferred to President Clinton's nominations had argued for years that it was inappropriate for senators to vote against a judge merely because they disagreed with a judge's legal philosophy. Those senators would not and could not abruptly reverse themselves. But what people cannot do immediately, they can learn to do after a time. Republicans voted for Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Breyer to send a message about how Thomas and Bork should have been treated -- and to lay down markers for how Republican judges should be treated in the future. But those votes, like the Sotomayor vote, occurred in the immediate aftermath of a Democratic presidential victory following many years of Republican administration. They do not necessarily foretell the future. As Republicans settle into opposition, they may begin to think and feel like an opposition. They may lose the practice of deference, forget their objections to the filibuster of judicial nominations. President Obama's next nominee can probably expect the same easy time that Ginsburg and Breyer enjoyed. But if there are more nominations in a hypothetical Obama second term, they may discover themselves haunted by Kennedy's malign precedent and Thomas' brutal ordeal. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of David Frum.","David Frum: Republicans haven't been nearly as tough on court nominees as Democrats have .

"France's freshly inaugurated Socialist president plunged Tuesday into the economic mess that has perplexed policymakers and threatened governments by calling for policies that would spur growth in the ailing eurozone. ""I said that my wish is that growth is not an empty phrase, that it is something which, in reality, is happening,"" Francois Hollande told reporters in a joint news conference with German Chancellor Angela Merkel in Berlin. ""Because, without growth, we can't do whatever we want, we won't reach the goals which we want to -- and to reduce the debt and deficit."" He said the best solution would be to ""put everything on the table"" on May 23, when the region's leaders plan to meet next. Hollande said he hopes Greece -- whose economy is teetering and whose populace is fed up with the  austerity demands imposed by the country's international lenders -- will remain in the eurozone, adding, ""That's why we have to make it possible for Greece to find solutions."" But he said it is up to the Greeks themselves to make their own decisions about what is best for the country. ""Whatever happens, I will respect the decision of Greece,"" he said. For her part, Merkel acknowledged after their hour-long meeting that ""there is going to be, maybe, differences, but also lots of togetherness."" She noted that Hollande's plane was struck by lightning as it flew from Paris. ""Maybe that's a good omen, a sign for our cooperation,"" said Merkel, who has championed austerity measures. France's first Socialist president since François Mitterrand left office in 1995 won in an election this month against incumbent Nicolas Sarkozy. Opinion: What Hollande's victory means for Europe's economy . Hollande named Jean-Marc Ayrault, a senior party member and mayor of Nantes, as prime minister and asked him to form the new government, his office said. At an investiture ceremony at the Elysee Palace in Paris, Hollande said he wants to balance the need to reduce the debts of European governments with efforts to stimulate growth. He said he wants to discourage ""exorbitant"" incomes. ""It's time to put production ahead of speculation,"" he said. ""The challenge of this five-year term is recovery,"" he said at the Hotel de Ville in Paris, prior to departing for Berlin. ""We have big plans. France will rise again and build on the strength and the energy of its creators, of its engineers, its researchers, those who make it live."" Hollande has unsettled investors with his criticism of the austerity policies central to European bailout deals for troubled economies like those of Greece and Ireland. Greeted by flag-waving crowds on the street, a steady stream of prominent French figures arrived at the Elysee ahead of Tuesday's inauguration ceremony and walked on a red carpet through the palace's sun-filled courtyard. They included the Socialist Party leader Martine Aubry and Bertand Delanoe, the mayor of Paris. Inside the palace, they gathered under chandeliers to witness the transfer of power. The president-elect's car traveled along the tree-lined streets and avenues of Paris, carrying him over the River Seine and past the Grand Palais before pulling up inside the courtyard. Hollande made his way up the carpet to be met by Sarkozy. The two men, who had fought an at-times bitter campaign, shook hands before entering the palace for a private meeting. Afterward, Sarkozy and his wife, Carla Bruni, left the palace, waving from a car as they were driven off, and Hollande was sworn in as the seventh president of France's Fifth Republic. Ayrault, his newly appointed prime minister, has served as president of the Socialists in the National Assembly since 1997. In the same year, Ayrault was given a six-month suspended sentence and fined 30,000 francs for political favoritism. Born in 1950 to working-class parents, he worked as a German teacher before entering politics. He has served as mayor of Nantes since 1989 and had been widely expected to be Hollande's pick for prime minister. Hollande's election coincided with the vote in Greece that spawned the current political chaos in Athens and moved Greece closer to the possibility of abandoning the euro, the currency used by it and 16 other European Union countries. Hollande's professed doubts about the fiscal austerity advocated by Merkel, whose party suffered defeat in a vote Sunday in Germany's largest state, have raised questions about whether Paris and Berlin will read from the same script. Hollande has wasted no time addressing the matter. Upcoming events include a Group of Eight meeting and NATO summit this month, followed by a G-20 gathering and a European Council meeting in June. His approach is expected to affect policy in Afghanistan as well as Turkey and the Middle East. With Sarkozy, the United States enjoyed support for its positions on Syria, Iran and Afghanistan. Sarkozy also was a proponent of the NATO air campaign in Libya. Hollande, meanwhile, has yet to stake out all of his foreign policy positions. During the election campaign, he pledged to withdraw all French combat troops from Afghanistan by the end of the year. He can expect NATO leaders to urge him to soften his position when he attends the summit in Chicago this month, the focus of which will be Afghanistan. Relations between Turkey and France have been tense because of Sarkozy's apparent opposition to Turkey becoming a member of the European Union. Legislation passed during his presidency that made the denial of the Armenian genocide a crime also raised hackles in Ankara. Some observers expect Hollande to show more flexibility on Turkey. Domestically, Hollande has to prove to the French public that he is capable of acting on his promise to bring people together after Sarkozy's presidency, which often polarized opinion. Voting in the first round of the presidential election showed large numbers of voters turning to parties on the far left and right of the political spectrum. That scenario could be repeated in legislative elections to be held next month, where Hollande's Socialist Party can secure a majority in parliament that would allow him to push through his agenda.","""My wish is that growth is not an empty phrase,"" Hollande says .

"He might be responsible for reviving one of the worst moments in the history of sunglasses -- the ""shutter shades"" -- but rapper Kanye West is hoping that all will be forgiven as he debuts his own line at Paris Fashion Week later this month. According to Vogue magazine, the ""Runaway"" hit-maker has hired London-based designer Katie Eary -- known for her vivid, eye-catching designs -- as one of the creative leads developing this new signature range of womenswear. But as we wait  to discover what West has up his sleeve, it remains to be seen if the superstar's foray into fashion will prove a wise career move. And anyway, does the world really need another celebrity clothing line? From the multi-million-dollar empires of pop-singers-cum-fashion-moguls P. Diddy and Jessica Simpson to the quietly shelved apparel of Lindsay Lohan and ""Sex in the City"" star Sarah Jessica Parker, the celebrity fashion game is rarely a predictable business. According to branding expert Tim Jeffrey, celebrity clothing brands are particularly mercurial because their success is so closely aligned to just one individual -- whose popularity can slump at the drop of a finely tailored hat. ""Before they start, they really have to ask themselves why they want to do it in the first place,"" says Jeffrey, who works for international brand consultancy firm ""i-am."" ""The principle of celebrity ranges is sound, as long as the star in question can add value,"" he says. ""For instance, look at Fred Perry. Here's a tennis star who could draw on his knowledge and expertise to create a credible sportswear brand that has endured even beyond his own life and career."" It's a view shared by Bruce Ross, president and CEO of specialist marketing consultancy Celebrity Fashion Group. ""Success or failure in this industry boils down to one word: Authenticity,"" he says. ""Consumers aren't stupid and they can generally tell when a celebrity is just doing it for the money while having no interest in the product."" Ross cites singers Gwen Stefani and Beyonce Knowles as stars with sturdy fashion credentials. Stefani is an established style icon, he says, who was known for concocting her own designs long before creating her label L.A.M.B. Meanwhile, Beyonce's line, ""House of Dereon"" pays tribute to her maternal grandmother Agnes Dereon -- a respected seamstress born in the 1920s. But, according to Ross,  many other stars are guilty of sheer opportunism. ""Take the Kardashian sisters,"" he says, in reference to the American socialites who recently launched their own range, ""Kardashian Kollection"" at the Sears chain of department stores. ""I mean, give me a break,"" says Ross. ""Sears is where people go to get a good deal on a washing machine or bag of tools. The partnership just doesn't make sense, it's not authentic."" It's not hard to see why every celebrity and their mother (Dina Lohan -- mom of Lindsay -- attempted to launch a budget shoe line in 2009) are hoping to cash in on their own brand of garments. All you have to do is follow the money. According to Women's Wear Daily magazine, Jessica Simpson's eponymous shoe and accessories brand is on its way to becoming the first celebrity label to rake in over $1 billion of sales, while Beyonce's husband and Kanye West label-mate, Jay-Z sold the rights to his urban-flavored clothing range Rocawear for $204 million in 2007. Then there's Elle Macpherson's lingerie business, Intimates; the eclectic lifestyle collection Elizabeth and James from former child-star twins Mary and Ashley Olsen; and who could forget Victoria Beckham's critically adored self-monikered couture brand -- all of which are in the black. ""But for every celebrity that makes it big, there's another screaming at their agents saying: 'They have a line, so I should have a line,'"" according to Ross, who says that most of his business comes from celebrities reaching out to him through their agents. ""Let me tell you, we turn down more than we take on,"" he adds. Amid all this, how do ""professional"" designers feel about celebrity big names treading on their turf? ""From a business perspective it's clearly a good idea,"" says UK-based menswear designer William Green, who's currently exhibiting at London Fashion Week. ""But I'm not a fan from a design point of view."" According to Green, it can be ""quite frustrating"" for those that spend their lives studying and working to build a reputation in fashion to watch as celebrities ""waltz in and launch a label overnight."" This is especially true, he says, ""when they cherry-pick ideas from relatively unknown designers and sell cheaper copies to a wider audience."" That said, Green believes the fashion establishment can also be guilty of snobbery when it comes to ""outsiders."" ""It's just clothes after all ...  and, you know, celebrity fashion lines are alright when they capture a personality. I like (former Oasis singer) Liam Gallagher's label Pretty Green because it just looks like all the stuff he'd wear himself."" So what advice for West before his big day on the catwalk? Branding expert Jeffrey has a sharp word of warning for any celebrity tempted to put their ego before common sense: . ""Whatever you do, don't make too much. Never over-order, so you leave the public wanting more. If your product is stuck on the clearance counter, you've had it.""","Rapper Kanye West will launch his own fashion label at forthcoming Paris Fashion Week .

In this town where the old ways of the mist-shrouded North Carolina mountains still abide alongside massive multi-million-dollar developments, a booming tourism industry and a lynchpin university complex at Appalachian State, the deaths in Room 225 at the Best Western Plus Blue Ridge Plaza hotel were indeed enough to get people talking. Not so much in the realm of the unknown, however. More in the spirit of there's-got-to-be-an-explanation -- and with genuine mountain sympathy for the victims and their families. ""If it's the same (cause for all three deaths), this is ridiculous,"" Betty Austin, owner of the Mountain House restaurant near the hotel, told CNN Monday. 5 things to know about carbon monoxide . ""Gotta be something going on,"" said Chuck Style, a manager at Idol's Tire & Auto Services also near the hotel. ""It's a real nice hotel. That's kinda what's so shocking about it,"" said Style, who added that the talk in town was focused on an unseen yet quite tangible probable cause: carbon monoxide. On Monday, investigators confirmed the locals' speculation. Boone Police Chief Dana Crawford told reporters that shortly after noon on Saturday, when emergency personnel responded to the hotel to find 11-year-old Jeffrey Lee Williams dead and his mother, Jeannie Williams, 49, ill, ""a presumptive test indicated elevated level of carbon monoxide in the room."" Crawford said after an autopsy on the boy's body, ""preliminary indications are that he died from asphyxia."" Other toxicology results were pending, he added. Crawford went on: full-blown toxicology tests had concluded within the last 24 hours that the deaths of Daryl Dean Jenkins, 73, and Shirley Mae Jenkins, 72, from Washington state, in Room 225 in April were both due to carbon monoxide poisoning. Autopsies conducted soon after the couple died had been incomplete. Left unsolved is the source of the smothering gas. ""As of today, the business remains closed and under the control of investigators,"" Crawford said Monday. Examiners from the state board overseeing plumbing, heating and fire sprinkler contractors will be at the hotel on Wednesday, the chief said. Williams, according to a relative quoted in the Charlotte Observer, had gone from home in Rock Hill, South Carolina, to Boone with her son to pick up her daughter from a mountain camp. She remained hospitalized in stable condition Monday. An attorney retained by the hotel issued a statement to media saying the ""health and safety of guests who stay at our hotel is our number one priority. ""Our thoughts and prayers go out to the family and friends of those involved,"" added attorney Paul Culpepper. ""We are cooperating fully with authorities who are investigating this truly tragic incident. The hotel will remain closed as we work closely with authorities to address any issues identified and authorities declare the hotel cleared for occupancy."" In Boone, where the mountain way of speaking to the point can cut as clean as a biting morning wind, restaurateur Austin summed up the attitude of many. ""If you had this happen one time,"" she said Monday, ""why in hell didn't they do something about it?""","An elderly couple from Washington state died in the room in April .
Autopsy results then were inconclusive .
On Saturday, an 11-year-old boy died in the same room .
Authorities link all three deaths to one cause: carbon monoxide ."
"Virtual ""killing sprees"" in Iran and Iraq led to a spike in the number of executions globally last year, according to Amnesty International, at odds with a steady decline in the use of the death penalty around the world over the last two decades. Executions by beheading, electrocution, firing squad, hanging and lethal injection rose by almost 15 percent in 2013 on the previous year, the organization said in its latest report on the death penalty released Thursday. China executed more people than any other country last year. Although Chinese authorities treat official execution statistics as a state secret, Amnesty International estimates thousands are killed under the death penalty every year, more than the rest of the world combined. Excluding China, executions rose to at least 778 last year, up from 682 in 2012. Iran came in second, with at least 369 put to death by the state, followed by Iraq (169), Saudi Arabia (79), and the United States (39). The United States was the only country in the Americas that performed executions, although use of the death penalty declined last year, to 39 executions from 43 in 2012. Texas accounted for more than 40 percent of all American executions. In total, 22 countries practiced capital punishment last year, one more than in 2012. Four of those countries -- Indonesia, Kuwait, Nigeria and Vietnam -- resumed executions after a hiatus. Amnesty International could not confirm if executions took place in countries in conflict, but said it ""cannot be excluded"" that executions took place in Syria and Egypt. At the end of 2013, more than 23,000 people were on death row around the world. ""The virtual killing sprees we saw in countries like Iran and Iraq were shameful,"" Amnesty International's Secretary General Salil Shetty said in a statement. He added, ""those states who cling to the death penalty are on the wrong side of history and are, in fact, growing more and more isolated."" Steady decline . Despite ""alarming levels of executions in an isolated group of countries,"" Amnesty noted that the majority of the world is abolitionist in law or practice. The use of the death penalty has declined in the last 20 years, and the number of countries enforcing the death penalty has fallen from 37 in 1993 to 22 last year -- evidence that executions are becoming ""a thing of the past,"" the report said. Some countries that performed executions in 2012, including Gambia, the United Arab Emirates and Pakistan, suspended use of the death penalty last year. No executions were carried out in Europe and Central Asia -- marking the first time since 2009. Belarus -- the only country in the region that still has the death penalty -- did not execute anyone in 2013. In the Middle East and North Africa, many of those executed were convicted under ""vague anti-terrorism laws,"" the report said. In Iran, where official figures indicate a rise in executions of 18% on 2012, Amnesty International said it had recorded ""numerous cases"" in which it appeared the death penalty had been used to oppress activities of Iran's ethnic minorities. Iraq saw an increase in executions of more than 30% compared to the previous year, the highest figure since 2003. Most executions in recent years are thought to have resulted from convictions under an anti-terror bill that covers acts such as ""provoking, planning, financing, committing or supporting others to commit terrorism."" The report said new counter-terrorism laws proposed by authorities in Egypt would expand the scope of the death penalty, and could pose a particular concern for the Muslim Brotherhood movement, which authorities classified as a terrorist organization in December, 2013. On Monday, a court sentenced more than 500 supporters of ousted president Mohammed Morsy to death for killing a police officer. Despite the high number of executions in China, there were ""limited signs of progress,"" according to the report. China's Supreme Court announced an end to the practice of harvesting organs from executed prisoners, and issued legal guidelines to ensure greater procedural protections in death penalty cases. In Africa, some countries including Benin, Ghana and Sierra Leone moved closer to ending the death penalty through constitutional and legal review processes that ""created real opportunities for the abolition of capital punishment."" In Somalia, however, executions rose dramatically in Somalia from six in 2012 to 34 last year. Death for theft, drugs, blasphemy . Crimes that attracted the death penalty ranged from murder, robbery, drug trafficking, and corruption, to acts which Amnesty said should not be considered crimes at all, including ""adultery,"" ""blasphemy,"" and ""sodomy."" The report noted that many countries use ""vaguely-worded political 'crimes' to put real or perceived dissidents to death."" In North Korea, where the organization said at least 70 executions took place according to reliable reports, people were apparently executed for cannibalism, pornography, escaping to China and watching banned videos from South Korea. Public executions were carried out in Iran, North Korea, Saudi Arabia and Somalia, but in many instances executions took place in secret. Iranian authorities acknowledged executing at least 369 people in 2013, but credible sources reported ""many hundreds"" more"" undocumented cases, the report said. In some countries, including Afghanistan, China, Iran, Iraq and North Korea, confessions were extracted through torture or other ill-treatment, according to Amnesty, and proceedings in most countries that still execute prisoners did not meet international fair trial standards. A deterrent? In five countries, India, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia and South Sudan, prisoners sentenced to death were not informed of their execution beforehand -- neither were their family members or lawyers. Almost all countries justified the use of the death penalty as an alleged deterrent against crime, a position which Amnesty said was becoming increasingly ""untenable and discredited."" The organization, which opposes the death penalty in all cases, called on governments who ""still kill in the name of justice"" to suspend the use of the death penalty immediately, with a view to abolishing it.","Amnesty study says executions jumped by 15 percent in 2013 .
China executed more people than rest of world combined .
A dramatic rise in executions was reported in Iran and Iraq .
There's no evidence capital punishment deters crime, report says ."
"Massachusetts lawmakers Thursday passed a bill banning ""upskirting"" in response to a ruling by the state's highest court that said a law aimed at criminalizing voyeurism did not apply to the snapping of secret photos up a woman's skirt. The bill now goes to Gov. Deval Patrick, who has publicly committed to signing it, his office said Thursday. The bill would make photographing or recording video under a person's clothing illegal, according to a statement from the office of Senate President Therese Murray. The act would be made a misdemeanor. ""The House took action today to bring Massachusetts laws up-to-date with technology and the predatory practice of 'upskirting.' We must make sure that the law protects women from these kind of frightening and degrading acts,"" House Speaker Robert A. DeLeo said in a statement. Victim of ""upskirting"" speaks out . ""I am proud of the Senate for taking action today to restore a women's [sic] right to privacy,"" said Murray. ""We are sending a message that to take a photo or video of a woman under her clothing is morally reprehensible and, in Massachusetts, we will put you in jail for doing it. We will need to revisit this law again and again as technology continues to evolve and ensure that we are providing the necessary protections."" The bill was passed one day after the state's highest court ruled that a law did not apply to the taking of secret photos up a woman's skirt. The ruling stemmed from the case against Michael Robertson, 32, who was arrested in 2010 and accused of using his cell phone to take pictures and record video up the skirts and dresses of women on the trolley, according to court documents. Two separate complaints were filed against Robertson with the transit police . Authorities then staged ""a decoy operation"" to catch Robertson, who was eventually arrested and charged with two counts of attempting to secretly photograph a person in a state of partial nudity. Police observed him point a cell phone video camera up the dress of a female officer, court documents state. Wednesday's ruling reversed a previous decision by a lower court, which had denied a motion by Robertson seeking the dismissal of the case, said a statement from the Suffolk County district attorney's office. The ruling said that state law ""does not apply to photographing (or videotaping or electronically surveilling) persons who are fully clothed and, in particular, does not reach the type of upskirting that the defendant is charged with attempting to accomplish on the MBTA."" The case against Robertson was dismissed on Wednesday after the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court ruled in his favor. ""In sum, we interpret the phrase, 'a person who is ... partially nude' in the same way that the defendant does, namely, to mean a person who is partially clothed but who has one or more of the private parts of body exposed in plain view at the time that the putative defendant secretly photographs her,"" the high court ruled. Suffolk County District Attorney Daniel Conley called for a rewrite of the law on Wednesday during a press conference.

"When Procter & Gamble shut down some access to the Internet this week, it wasn't to keep employees from messing around on Facebook or crafting personal e-mails on company time. Instead, it was to get them to quit sucking up the company's Web bandwidth by listening to music and watching movies. In a memo Tuesday, the company, which sells everything from Tide detergent to Pringles to Duracell batteries, told its 129,000 employees they can no longer use music-streaming site Pandora or movie site Netflix at work. ""We are one of the more lenient companies in terms of providing access to the internet, but there are some sites which don't serve a specific business purpose -- in this case, Netflix and Pandora,"" Procter& Gamble spokesman Paul Fox said in an e-mail. ""They are both great sites, but if you want to download movies or music, do it on your own time."" According to the memo, an internal report found that P&G employees were watching 50,000 five-minute YouTube videos and listening to 4,000 hours of music on Pandora on a typical day. At one point, the company's Web capacity was overtaxed, ""requiring immediate interaction,"" the memo said. Since the company uses YouTube as a tool to sell its products, Netflix was banned instead in the effort to free up bandwidth. Since the dawn of the Internet age, companies have struggled with how to handle personal computer use while employees are on the clock. It's not rare for companies, both large and small, to ban some or all personal Internet and even e-mail use. But as more and more businesses need Web access to function (and as web content becomes more data-intensive), many are struggling with a so-called bandwidth ""spectrum crunch."" Wireless carriers are also struggling with the issue. The growth of the smartphone and tablet markets have dramatically increased the amount of data being accessed at any given time. Global mobile data traffic is just about doubling every year and will continue to do so through at least 2016, according to Cisco's Mobile Visual Networking Index, the industry's most comprehensive annual study. Steve Feller, a steering committee member of an IT professional group in Cincinnati (where Procter & Gamble is based) told the Cincinnati Enquirer that social networking and other personal computer use has become a serious concern at some companies, threatening to slow the flow of data. ""Effective IT leaders need to address this within their companies now,"" said Feller. ""It is not something to be ignored."" But it's not just employees. Companies themselves are using the web more. The rise of cloud computing means that a lot of data that once would have been stored internally is being accessed from the web, sometimes multiple times in a day. ""As P&G drives to become one of the most digitally advanced companies in the world, more and more of our business processes, applications and systems are being web enabled,"" Fox said in the e-mail. ""That in turn makes bandwidth capacity and availability even more critical."" Ad Age notes that Netflix and Pandora competitors -- such as Spotify, Hulu and Vudu -- aren't blocked, although the company says Tuesday's move may just be a first step.","Procter & Gamble bans Pandora, Netflix for its 129,000 employees .

"The cafe siege in the heart of Sydney ended early Tuesday with the death of the gunman and two of his hostages -- but a great deal of unanswered questions remain. ""This has been an absolutely appalling and ugly incident,"" Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott said, noting that Sydney had been ""touched by terrorism for the first time in more than 35 years."" Details have emerged about the two hostages who died amid the siege's chaotic final moments -- and about the man who held them and others captive. But with police still investigating what happened during the 16 long hours of the hostage taking, here's a summary of what we know and don't know about key aspects of the story: . THE VICTIMS . What we know: Authorities have identified the two hostages who were killed: Katrina Dawson, 38, and Tori Johnson, 34. A growing number of tributes are being paid to Dawson, a lawyer, and Johnson, the manager of the cafe. Dawson, a mother of three, worked down the street from the cafe. Johnson had been employed by Lindt for more than two years. What we don't know: How exactly they died. Unconfirmed reports in Australia media suggest both Dawson and Johnson may have been killed trying to protect others. The Australian Broadcasting Corporation reported that Johnson was trying to wrestle the gun from the hostage taker. The Courier Mail reported that Dawson was trying to defend a pregnant colleague. Police have declined to comment on the reports, saying what happened is still under investigation. THE GUNMAN . What we know: The hostage-taker has been named as Man Haron Monis, a 50-year-old man who was born in Iran and settled in Australia. Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott described Monis as ""a deeply disturbed individual (with) a long history of crime, a long history of mental instability and infatuation with extremism."" He pleaded guilty last year to writing offensive letters to the families of Australian troops. He was also facing charges of being an accessory to murder, as well as over 45 sexual and assault related offenses, according to authorities. What we don't know: Why he wasn't being more closely monitored? Abbott summed up the questions on many people's minds Tuesday when he asked at a news conference, ""How can someone who has had such a long and checkered history not be on the appropriate watch lists and how can someone like that be entirely at large in the community?"" He said Australian authorities would be looking at those questions ""in the days and weeks ahead."" THE MOTIVE . What we know: During the siege, Abbott said the hostage-taker ""sought to cloak his actions with the symbolism of the (ISIS) death cult,"" referring to the terrorist group that has seized control of large areas of Iraq and Syria. According to his website and social media posts, Monis styled himself as a Muslim cleric, espousing extremist views. After he settled in Australia, Monis ""became sympathetic to what he perceived ... was the victimization of Muslims and Islamists around the world,"" his former lawyer Manny Conditsis told CNN. But his bigger cause, according to Conditsis, was lobbying the Australian government against sending troops to fight in wars on foreign soil like Afghanistan, where Monis said innocent women and children were being killed. Monis was ""intensely conflicted and contradicted and inconsistent,"" Conditsis said. What we don't know: What Monis was trying to achieve by taking hostages in the cafe. The full picture is yet to emerge of what demands he made of authorities. Australian media reported Monday that he requested an ISIS flag and a phone call with Abbott. Conditsis said that when he represented Monis last year, he ""never, ever spoke of physical violence of any kind."" He suggested that something might have happened in the intervening months that caused him ""to become unhinged."" Monis' last tweet linked to his website, with a message posted the day of his attack on the Sydney cafe: ""If we stay silent towards the criminals we cannot have a peaceful society. The more you fight with crime, the more peaceful you are."" THE SIEGE . What we know: After around 16 hours of the agonizing standoff, police moved in after hearing gunfire inside the cafe, according New South Wales Police Commissioner Andrew P. Scipione. The Courier Mail reported that a technical support sniper positioned on the second floor of a building opposite the store made the call -- ""Hostage down ... window two"" -- that changed the course of events. Police say they believe Monis was acting alone. Besides the two people who were killed, four others were wounded by gunshots and two pregnant women were being assessed for health and welfare, police said. All of them were reported to be in stable condition. What we don't know: What exactly happened inside the cafe. While reports of what took place are emerging in the Australian media, authorities are staying tight-lipped as investigations continue. ""We're clearly speaking to those victims and we're clearly speaking to other witnesses. But this is going to take a bit of time to piece this together because a lot of those people are quite traumatized,"" said New South Wales Deputy Police Commissioner Catherine Burn. THE REACTION . What we know: Australian leaders have applauded the reaction of their citizens, pointing to the large numbers of flowers being laid at the scene of the siege in tribute to the victims. ""People have gone about their business and in the aftermath of the end of the siege last night, people have responded with typical Australian decency and generosity,"" Abbott said. Muslim leaders in Australia quickly condemned the hostage taking as ""a criminal act"" that has no place in Islam. Amid fears that Australian Muslims could become the targets of retaliatory attacks, Twitter users offered to accompany Muslims wearing religious clothes on public transport as a gesture of solidarity. The social media campaign took off, with the hashtag #illridewithyou becoming the top trending hashtag globally in a few hours.  Meanwhile, the New South Wales police announced Tuesday that it was launching a three-week operation across Sydney focused on ""high-visibility policing, increased presence in public places and public transport hubs."" What we don't know: What the future holds. The cafe siege has raised troubling questions about the possibility of more so-called ""lone wolf"" attacks. ""The tragedy of these times is that there are people, even in a society such as ours, who wish to do us harm,"" Abbott said. ""We are not immune to the politically motivated violence which has for so long stalked other countries."" In recent months, Australia introduced some of the toughest anti-terrorism laws in the world and raised the national terrorism alert level. But Abbott said that authorities can only do so much to prevent attacks without prior warning and knowledge. ""Even if this individual --- this sick and disturbed individual --- had been front and centre on our watch lists, even if this individual had been monitored 24 hours a day, it's quite likely, certainly possible, that this incident could have taken place, because the level of control that would be necessary to prevent people from going about their daily life would be very, very high indeed,"" the Prime Minister said. The scene in Sydney: Grenades and gunfire .","The hostages who died are identified as Katrina Dawson and Tori Johnson .
It's unclear what exactly happened in the final moments of the siege .
Authorities are trying to figure out why the gunman wasn't on terrorist watch lists .
Described as ""deeply disturbed,"" the attacker's aims and motive remain uncertain ."
"In the intraparty battle for the GOP, score Round 1 for the Republican establishment over the tea party. CNN projects that North Carolina House Speaker Thom Tillis has won the state's GOP Senate primary. Tillis, who was backed by many mainstream Republicans, topped 40% of the primary vote Tuesday, avoiding a runoff in July. Tillis beat a bunch of more conservative candidates for the chance to face off this November against first-term Democratic Sen. Kay Hagan, who is considered very vulnerable in the general election. Flipping her seat and five others held by Democrats would give Republicans control of the Senate. In his victory speech, Tillis slammed Hagan's record, tying her to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and calling them ""an echo chamber for President Obama's worst ideas."" ""We need to be clear, it's not the end of a primary, it's really the beginning of a primary mission, which has been the mission all along and that is to beat Kay Hagan and to make Harry Reid irrelevant,"" he said. Rand Paul stumbles and four other takeaways from election night . ""You know, their failures, both Obama's and Kay Hagan's, are obvious,"" Tillis added. ""We know a lot of them -- our government is borrowing too much money and it's dangerously in debt to China. Obamacare is not working. And Obama and Hagan's left-wing political agenda is driving up our energy prices and making our country less safe. ""For six years, she's voted with Obama and against North Carolina,"" he said. Trailing Tillis is tea party activist Greg Brannon. He enjoyed the support of many tea party groups, other influential conservative organizations and endorsements from the likes of Sens. Mike Lee of Utah and Rand Paul of Kentucky, who joined Brannon on Monday at a rally in Charlotte. Mark Harris, a prominent Baptist minister who helped drive the 2012 passage of a constitutional amendment that strengthened the state's same-sex marriage ban, is on his way to a third-place finish. Harris was backed by a high-profile fellow pastor, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, a 2008 Republican presidential candidate who may run again in 2016. Since the birth of the tea party movement in 2009, primary challenges from the right have produced major headlines and headaches for the GOP and hurt the party's chances of winning back the Senate from Democrats in the past two election cycles. Candidates backed by the tea party movement and other grass-roots conservatives effectively cost the GOP five winnable Senate elections the past two cycles in Nevada, Delaware, Colorado, Indiana and Missouri. The establishment strikes back . This election cycle, mainstream Republicans don't want another sequel. In North Carolina, Tillis won recent endorsements from two high-profile Republicans: 2012 presidential nominee Mitt Romney and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, a potential 2016 White House hopeful. More importantly, while none of the candidates in the GOP primary, including Tillis, raised or spent a lot of money in the campaign, the state House speaker won the backing of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and American Crossroads, two outside groups that combined have spent millions this cycle to run ads in support of Tillis and other establishment picks that they feel are ""electable"" come November. Last week, in what was described as a major buy, the pro-business Chamber launched a television commercial that described Tillis as ""a bold conservative who balanced our budget and reduced regulations. A businessman who delivered tax relief."" And Crossroads, the big-spending outside group co-founded and steered by Karl Rove, says it has spent nearly $2 million in support of Tillis. That spending dwarfed the money shelled out by outside conservative groups that backed Brannon. ""It was clear from the start that Thom Tillis is the only proven conservative who can defeat Kay Hagan and take on President Obama's liberal agenda, and tonight's victory is the first step toward making that happen,"" said American Crossroads President and CEO Steven Law. Paul was quick to back Tillis. ""Now that the primary is over, it is time for our side to unite to defeat the Democrat who cast the deciding vote for Obamacare, Kay Hagan, in November. I endorse Thom Tillis and look forward to working with him in the Senate,"" Paul wrote on Facebook. And a top tea party leader who had backed Brannon sounded conciliatory. ""While we obviously aren't happy with the outcome, we congratulate Speaker Tillis for his win,"" said Tea Party Patriots' Jenny Beth Martin. ""The important thing now is to pick up a U.S. Senate seat that's been in liberal hands for the last six years."" National Democrats argue that the competitive primary pushed Tillis too far to the right for the more mainstream electorate in November. ""Thom Tillis spent this primary moving far to the right, embracing positions that, paired with his record, make him a deeply flawed candidate,"" said Mike Czin, Democratic National Committee press secretary. Clay Aiken has slim edge in North Carolina primary . More rounds to come . The voting Tuesday in North Carolina, as well as Indiana and Ohio, kicks off five straight weeks of primary contests that should give a clearer indication of whether establishment Republicans have gained the upper hand against the tea party movement for control of the party. Two more showdowns between establishment and grass-roots conservatives come on May 20, as the action moves to Georgia and Kentucky, where Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell faces a long-shot challenge from businessman Matt Bevin, who is backed by many tea party groups and by some influential conservative organizations. In Georgia, there's a wide-open, free-for-all fight to succeed retiring GOP Sen. Saxby Chambliss. The candidates considered to be more moderate are polling ahead of the more conservative candidates. Two weeks later, on June 3, the establishment-vs.-tea party faceoff shifts to Mississippi, which is one of eight states holding primaries that day. Six-term Sen. Thad Cochran is facing a serious challenge from state lawmaker Chris McDaniel, but private polling indicates the incumbent has a comfortable lead. Victories by the more moderate mainstream candidates improve the GOP's odds of recapturing the Senate this November. Democrats hold a 55-45 majority in the chamber but are defending 21 of the 36 seats up in November. Half of those Democratic seats are in red or purple states, such as North Carolina. Tea party leaders say they've 'changed the narrative' Leaders of the grass-roots movement disagree that their defeat in the North Carolina Senate primary suggests that the tide has turned against them. ""I think the establishment is taking its victory lap a little early,"" said Kevin Broughton, spokesman for the Tea Party Patriots Citizens Fund. And regardless of the outcome of the primary contests, Amy Kremer says the tea party is already victorious. ""The tea party has already won because we have changed the narrative and the political landscape in Washington. Now, both sides of the aisle express concern about our ballooning national debt,"" said Kremer, who just stepped down as chairwoman of the Tea Party Express and is now helping Bevin in his bid to unseat McConnell in Kentucky. 'American Idol' star holds slim lead . While the Senate contest in North Carolina landed in the national spotlight, some House primaries also grabbed attention. Two-term GOP Rep. Renee Ellmers faced a primary challenge from a conservative talk radio host because of her being open to considering some limited immigration reform. But she cruised to victory in the GOP primary in the state's 2nd Congressional District. Her re-election bid may grab even more national attention if former ""American Idol"" star Clay Aiken wins the Democratic nomination in the district. The race between Aiken and two other Democratic candidates is still too close to call. With all precincts reporting, Aiken has 40.83% of the vote, with Keith Crisco just behind at 39.4%. If the margin holds up, Aiken would exceed the 40% threshold needed to avoid a runoff. And while only 369 votes separated them, Aiken's tiny advantage is still outside the 1% margin to stave off a recount. Aiken told supporters Tuesday night that he was ""confident"" his campaign would be victorious. ""I said earlier tonight, I sort of preferred when they just open the envelope,"" he said, a reference to his days on the ""American Idol"" stage. In the state's 3rd Congressional District, CNN projects that 10-term Republican Rep. Walter Jones, an anti-war libertarian, has won a hard-fought primary against establishment pick Taylor Griffin, a former George W. Bush administration official who also had a senior role in Bush's 2004 re-election campaign. Ohio showdowns . In Ohio, Cuyahoga County Executive Ed FitzGerald won the Democratic gubernatorial nomination. FitzGerald, a former FBI agent, mayor and assistant county prosecutor, easily topped Larry Ealy, a former tow-truck driver from the Dayton area. FitzGerald will now face off in November against Republican Gov. John Kasich, who's running for re-election. The contest could turn into a marquee gubernatorial battle. House Speaker John Boehner easily won his primary. The 12-term Republican lawmaker, who represents Ohio's 8th Congressional District, a GOP stronghold in the southwest part of the Buckeye State, topped two tea party-backed challengers.

"(Mental Floss) -- It's Nobel Prize announcement week, and if you had Carol W. Greider, Elizabeth Blackburn, or Jack Szostak in your office pool, you're off to a good start (the trio will share this year's Nobel Prize in Medicine). As we await news of the rest of the winners, here are some stories about past Nobel laureates. Nobel Prize winners receive a medal and a cash award. 1. Robert Lucas, winner of the 1995 Nobel Prize in Economics for his work on the theory of ""rational expectations,"" split his $1 million prize with his ex-wife. If there were a Nobel Prize for Foresight or Timing, she should be nominated, based on a clause in their divorce settlement from seven years earlier: ""Wife shall receive 50 percent of any Nobel Prize."" The clause expired on October 31, 1995. Had Lucas won any year after, he would have kept the whole million. 2. Physicist Lise Meitner, whose work helped lead to the discovery of nuclear fission, was reportedly nominated for the Nobel Prize 13 times without ever winning (though nominations are kept secret, so we don't know for sure). This makes her the Dynasty of the Nobel Prize scene -- that show was nominated for 24 Emmy Awards but never won. Other analogies we'd accept: The Color Purple (11 Oscar nominations in 1985, no wins), the Buffalo Bills or Minnesota Vikings (4 Super Bowl losses each without a victory) and William Jennings Bryan (three-time Democratic nominee for President, losing twice to McKinley and once to Taft.) 3. People who refused the prize: . • Le Duc Tho was awarded the 1973 Nobel Peace Prize with Henry Kissinger for their roles in brokering a Vietnam cease fire at the Paris Peace Accords. Citing the absence of actual peace in Vietnam, Tho declined to accept. • Jean Paul Sartre waved off the 1964 Nobel Prize in Literature. His explanation: ""It is not the same thing if I sign Jean-Paul Sartre or if I sign Jean-Paul Sartre, Nobel Prize winner. A writer must refuse to allow himself to be transformed into an institution, even if it takes place in the most honorable form."" • Afraid of Soviet retribution if he traveled to Stockholm to claim his prize, Boris Pasternak declined to accept the 1958 Prize in Literature, which he'd earned for Doctor Zhivago. The Academy refused his refusal. ""This refusal, of course, in no way alters the validity of the award. There remains only for the Academy, however, to announce with regret that the presentation of the Prize cannot take place."" Yevgeny Pasternak accepted the prize on behalf of his deceased father in 1989. • Swedish poet Erik Axel Karlfeldt won for Literature in 1918. He did not accept because he was Secretary of the Swedish Academy, which awards the prize. He was given the award posthumously in 1931. This was allowed because the nomination was made before Karlfeldt died -- no candidate may be proposed after death. Mental Floss: 10 technologies we stole from the animal kingdom . 4. In 2007, 90-year-old professor Leonid Hurwicz became the oldest person to ever win (one-third of the Prize in Economics); at 87, writer Doris Lessing became the oldest woman (Literature). 5. DNA expert Kary Mullis -- 1993 winner of the Nobel Prize in Chemistry -- was scheduled to be a defense witness in O.J. Simpson's murder trial. However, Simpson's lawyer Barry Scheck felt the prosecution's DNA case was already essentially destroyed, and he didn't want Mullis' personal life to distract jurors (he'd expressed an affinity for LSD.) 6.

The Curie family is a Nobel Prize machine, winning five: Pierre and Marie for Physics in 1901; Marie solo for Chemistry in 1911; daughter Irene and her husband Frédéric Joliot-Curie for Chemistry in 1935; and Henry Labouisse, who was married to Pierre and Marie's daughter Eve, accepted on behalf of UNICEF in 1965. 11. Marie Curie's second prize was marred by scandal. Then a widow, Curie had an affair with a married scientist, Paul Langevin -- a former pupil of Pierre Curie. Love letters were involved, eventually leading to a duel between Langevin and the editor of the newspaper that had printed them (no shots were actually fired.) According to NobelPrize.org, when it was suggested that Curie not accept the prize, she wrote a shrewd letter, ""which pointed out that she had been awarded the Prize for her discovery of radium and polonium, and that she could not accept the principle that appreciation of the value of scientific work should be influenced by slander concerning a researcher's private life."" 12. Singing support --While there's no evidence the Nobel judges can be swayed by theme songs, that hasn't stopped Loriana Lana from composing one for Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi.

Nobel died on December 10, 1896. The formal awards ceremony is held in Stockholm each year on the anniversary of his death. The first awards show took place on December 10, 1901. (These things take time to plan.) And in case you were wondering just how much of a say Alfred Nobel had in the prize, here's what he wrote in his will: . ""The whole of my remaining realizable estate shall be dealt with in the following way: . ""The capital shall be invested by my executors in safe securities and shall constitute a fund, the interest on which shall be annually distributed in the form of prizes to those who, during the preceding year, shall have conferred the greatest benefit on mankind. The said interest shall be divided into five equal parts, which shall be apportioned as follows: one part to the person who shall have made the most important discovery or invention within the field of physics; one part to the person who shall have made the most important chemical discovery or improvement; one part to the person who shall have made the most important discovery within the domain of physiology or medicine; one part to the person who shall have produced in the field of literature the most outstanding work of an idealistic tendency; and one part to the person who shall have done the most or the best work for fraternity among nations, for the abolition or reduction of standing armies and for the holding and promotion of peace congresses. ""The prizes for physics and chemistry shall be awarded by the Swedish Academy of Sciences; that for physiological or medical works by the Caroline Institute in Stockholm; that for literature by the Academy in Stockholm; and that for champions of peace by a committee of five persons to be elected by the Norwegian Storting. It is my express wish that in awarding the prizes no consideration whatever shall be given to the nationality of the candidates, so that the most worthy shall receive the prize, whether he be Scandinavian or not.""

"Deep inside Cameroon's Lobeke National Park a team of conservationists venture into the lush rainforest, weaving their way through the bush's narrow paths. Tasked with patrolling the immense park, these eco-guards are on a mission to protect its pristine habitat and the life that resides within. Ever alert, they push deeper into the woods to prevent any illegal activities that could put Lobeke's fragile ecosystem in danger. Amongst the park's wide array of creatures, there's one species that's particularly vulnerable. ""The major threat is elephant poaching for ivory,"" says Zacharie Nzooh, who joined the World Wildlife Fund more than 10 years ago. ""There was a big elephant population here,"" he recalls. ""When I first arrived here in 2002, I saw 35 elephants at once. But progressively, despite the efforts put in place to fight poaching, the elephant population continues to dwindle. So we steadily saw their population fall -- [from] seeing 35 elephants on one occasion to seeing only four, three, two or one elephant at a time."" Read this: Unmanned plane to spy on rhino poachers . Over the past decade, conservationists say poachers have shrunk Africa's forest elephant population by 62%, threatening the magnificent mammals with eventual extinction. At last count, Cameroon had some of the world's last significant populations of forest elephants, with about 20,000 of them remaining. The main purpose of Nzooh's team is to deter poachers through their presence, as well as arrest any illegal hunters. Last year the patrols arrested 16 poachers in Lobeke, which is situated in southeast Cameroon, within the Congo Basin forest. Will elephants still roam earth in 20 years? But even as eco-guards intensify their efforts, poachers are getting hungrier for ivory; the precious commodity is selling for hundreds, even thousands of dollars per kilogram on the black market. The lucrative poaching market has been built on high demand from Asia, attracting organized criminals who are increasingly using more sophisticated methods in their illegal activities. ""These crimes are committed because of the elephant tusks, which are sold to big traders within the community,"" says eco-guard Simon Pierre Mpouop. ""The traders go and sell the ivory at higher prices in other big towns. This explains why it has become a recurrent activity in Lobeke."" Last year, heavily armed poachers from Sudan arrived on horseback at the Bouba Ndjida Park in northern Cameroon. They slaughtered more than 300 elephants within a matter of weeks, taking only the tusks. In some cases, poachers waited for surviving elephants to return to the scene to mourn their dead before shooting them as well. At the end of it all, poachers had eliminated more than half of that park's elephant population, leaving the park to resemble a battlefield, instead of a tourist destination. Under-equipped eco-guards are no match for these kinds of well-coordinated attacks. ""It's frustrating that we should be doing so much to protect the species in this park, yet those who take the laws into their hands continue to slaughter elephants because of their tusks,"" says Mpouop. Read this: Boy's website helps tourists spot big beasts . Second in size only to the Amazon rainforest, the Congo Basin spans six African countries, including the Central African Republic and the Republic of Congo, which share part of their borders with Lobeke. Lobeke and its peripheral zone cover more than 650,000 hectares. There are currently 40 eco-guards in place but that's not enough to properly patrol the entire length of the park. Nzooh says they need more than twice as many guards, as well as better equipment and weaponry to ensure surveillance across the whole park. ""We need to have a permanent monitoring station,"" he says. ""And for eco-guards to work, they must have the appropriate equipment, appropriate arms to first ensure their protection, but also to serve as a deterrent."" The park's rangers earn $15 each day they patrol. Tasked with enforcing the law, the park guards often cover the forest on foot, gathering clues to track an evasive enemy. ""We often walk several kilometers without even getting to a small stream from which we can fetch drinking water,"" says Mpoup. ""It's really difficult because you can come across a wild, harmful animal, and you won't be able to escape; this is a regular phenomenon here,"" he adds. Read this: Last of the bush trackers on the trail of a dying art . Last year, more than 60 rangers died in the line of duty, protecting parks around the world. According to the International Ranger Federation, more than half of these deaths were homicides. Whether clashing with poachers or confronting wildlife, danger seems to always lurk for these guardians of the forest. ""I can say that our missions are calculated risks,"" says Mpoup. ""Anytime we enter Lobeke, it's a big calculated risk,"" he adds. Bur despite the risks and the often limited means, Nzooh says there's a glimmer of hope. Though it is harder to come by elephants in the park today, the conservationist still envisions a clearing filled with animals the way it was 10 years ago. He says the elephant stands a chance so long as the crackdown on ivory markets continues. ""The number of elephants in the national park of Lobeke has not reached a critical stage,"" says Nzooh. ""I am certain that if significant efforts are put in place the elephants will survive. Those efforts must be made on different levels, on site level, on an international level and on a national level.""

"They may be swapping Russia's two top political offices in real life, but they are just children riding trikes together forever -- at least in a new kids' coloring book. The creators of a scandalous sexy calendar for Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin have revealed a new gift for him at his 59th birthday: a children's coloring book with the main characters Dima (short for Dmitry) and Vova (short for Vladimir), closely resembling President Dmitry Medvedev and Putin, working and playing together. The book's publishers, Maksim Perlin and Vladimir Tabak, presented the book Thursday ahead of Putin's birthday on Friday. They said they would send the premier a copy. The authors said 25,000 copies of the 14-page coloring book will be printed and will sell for 150 rubles ($4.62). ""When children are asked who they want to be when they grow up, they often respond ""Dima and Vova,"" Perlin said. ""So we decided to create a coloring book for kids where the two leaders of the state would be their age."" Vova, according to the book, wakes up at 6.45 a.m. and does exercises in front of a map of Russia.  Dima has a bed with a teddy bear, a poster of Deep Purple and a portrait of Steve Jobs, two of Medvedev's favorites. Dima loves apples and Vova loves porridge (the authors believe it will help Vova to become stronger and smarter). The two boys ride tricycles and play badminton together, and are shown working at the Russian White House and the Kremlin. Vova, who got a new school case this year with an All Russia's Children Front emblem on it, spends his days giving wise advice to other kids in a ""white building with a flag on the rooftop"" -- a ""difficult job no one else apart from him is able to do,"" the captions under the book's pictures read. His friend Dima is busy with ""making people happier."" Last year, the same authors released an erotic calendar for Putin's birthday in which students from Moscow State University posed in lingerie with captions such as ""You put out the forest fires, but I'm still burning."" The calendar was briefly on sale in Moscow supermarkets for 260 rubles (about $8.50) but was pulled from shelves after public outcry over the racy photos and innuendo. ""Girls on our calendar caused too much negativity,"" said Pavel Petukhov, the artist of the book. ""We have chosen a different target audience. But I think that both adults and children will like this book."" ""It's a fun, beautiful project. I think Putin will like this too,"" Perlin said .","Vladimir Putin and Dmitry Medvedev star as children in a new coloring book .

"A New Jersey judge rejected the state's appeal to halt same-sex marriages on Thursday, clearing the way for couples to marry later this month. Superior Court Judge Mary Jacobson denied the state's motion to stay her September 27 ruling that civil unions were insufficient because they hindered federal benefits. In that ruling, Jacobson cited the U.S. Supreme Court's June rejection of part of the federal Defense of Marriage Act, a move that ensured that same-sex spouses legally married in a state may receive federal benefits. The state argued in its appeal that it already provides equal marital rights and benefits to same-sex couples in New Jersey with civil unions, saying any federal benefits or rights deprived to partners in civil unions fall on the shoulders of the federal government, not theirs. But in her ruling on Thursday, Jacobson said the inability for partners in civil unions to access federal marriage benefits violates New Jersey's constitution. Same-sex couples will be able to wed beginning October 21. However, the state will seek a stay of the ruling from an appellate court, said Lee Moore, a spokesman for the state Attorney General's Office.  Lee said the state will continue to seek an expedited review of the case by the New Jersey Supreme Court. ""This is a historic moment for all loving and committed couples in New Jersey,"" said Mike Premo of New Jersey United For Marriage. ""The fact that those who have waited so long for this moment can get married in just 11 days is truly amazing and something to be celebrated."" New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie's office, which said after the September 27 ruling that it had wanted the ""issue of marriage equality"" to be on the ballot this November,"" declined any new comment on Thursday. Aides referred CNN to Christie's remarks from the gubernatorial debate this week. ""I don't think (the issue) should be decided by 121 politicians in Trenton or seven judges on the Supreme Court,"" Christie said in his debate against Democratic State Sen. Barbara Buono. ""It should be decided by the 8.8 million people of New Jersey, and if they do decide to change the definition of marriage by referendum then I will support that law and enforce that part of the constitution with the same vigor that I've done for the last four years with every other part.""","Judge upholds her September ruling on same-sex marriage .

"Police in Thailand say two Burmese men have confessed to the murder of two British tourists on a popular resort island last month. The bodies of Hannah Witheridge and David Miller were discovered early on September 15 on a beach on Koh Tao, a small southern island in Thailand. They were partially undressed with severe injuries to their heads. A hoe with blood on it was found close by, police said. The pair, both in their early 20s, were last seen at bar on the island hanging out with friends. An autopsy revealed both victims had been hit by a hard object, according to Maj. Gen. Pornchai Suteerakhun, the head of the Police Hospital's Institute of Forensic Medicine. Miller was hit and had scratches on his back, in addition to having water in his lungs consistent with drowning, an autopsy showed. Witheridge was hit several times on her head and face and her body had evidence of sexual intercourse, according to her autopsy. DNA match . On Friday, Police Commissioner Gen. Somyot Poompanmuang told CNN that DNA in semen taken from Witheridge matched samples taken from the two men. ""The DNA matching result is out already and they matched with DNA found on the female victim,"" he said, adding that the men admitted to raping Witheridge. He said DNA samples taken from cigarette butts found near the bodies also matched those of the two suspects. The men, who haven't been named, have been in custody since October 1, police said. Somyot said the two men told police that they became aroused after spotting the couple and moved in to attack them. They said they hit Miller on the back of the head, then raped Witheridge before hitting her in the face several times. Somyot said the two Burmese suspects would reenact the incident for police on Koh Tao later Friday. The deaths have shaken residents on the idyllic island, which takes up only 21 square kilometers (8 square miles) amid bright blue waters in the Gulf of Thailand. Authorities said it was the first homicide case on Koh Tao in at least eight years. The island is popular among tourists for its diving locations, white sand beaches and vibrant nightlife.","Hannah Witheridge and David Miller were discovered early on September 15 .

"Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama announced Monday that the United States will resume using military commissions to prosecute alleged terrorists held at the Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, detention facility. In the announcement, the president said his administration remains committed to closing the controversial detention facility but will rescind its previous suspension on bringing new charges before military commissions. The commissions are military proceedings rather than trials in civilian courts. Obama also called for prosecuting Guantanamo detainees in U.S. criminal courts when appropriate, and issued an executive order calling for periodic reviews of suspects held under indefinite detention. The steps followed through on Obama's previous call to reform the process of prosecuting or holding Guantanamo detainees to make it more in line with international laws and standards, according to senior administration officials who briefed reporters on condition of not being identified by name. However, the American Civil Liberties Union and the Center for Constitutional Rights both criticized the administration for what they called institutionalizing indefinite detention of terrorism suspects who have yet to be formally charged or designated for transfer to another country, but are considered too dangerous to set free. ""The creation of a review process that will take up to a year -- designed to be repeated every four years -- is a tacit acknowledgment that the Obama administration intends to leave Guantanamo as a scheme for unlawful detention without charge and trial for future presidents to clean up, despite the fact that senior officials acknowledged today that keeping the prison open continues to hinder our national security in the long run,"" the constitutional rights center said in a statement. Democratic Rep. Jerrold Nadler of New York also called the administration's announcement disappointing, saying the Guantanamo facility is a ""blot"" on U.S. national honor. Noting that Congress passed a law prohibiting the transfer of Guantanamo detainees for trial in the United States, Nadler said that ""as a result, the administration has turned to the legally dubious military commissions to try these suspects."" Established in response to the September 11, 2001, terrorism attacks on the United States, the Guantanamo Bay facility has been a lightning rod for criticism of the U.S. handling of terrorism suspects. Under the Bush administration, allegations of mistreatment of detainees, including harsh living conditions and denying them full U.S. legal rights, led to the facility becoming a recruiting tool for terrorist groups such as al Qaeda, U.S. officials say. Obama previously pledged to close the Guantanamo Bay facility within a year of taking office in January 2009, prompting criticism from conservatives. In addition, his administration has sought to prosecute some high-profile detainees -- such as alleged September 11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed -- in civilian courts on the U.S. mainland, which drew widespread opposition that crossed traditional party lines. The Guantanamo facility remains open today due to legal complexities involving the status of some detainees and congressional opposition to holding trials for high-profile suspects in U.S. criminal courts. Shortly after Obama's announcement Monday, Defense Secretary Robert Gates announced the withdrawal of his prior suspension of new charges before military commissions. Gates cited reforms of the military commissions under a 2009 law, and he and Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Adm. Mike Mullen both expressed support for also using civilian courts to prosecute terrorism suspects. ""For reasons of national security, we must have available to us all the tools that exist for preventing and combating international terrorist activity, and protecting our nation,"" Gates' statement said. ""For years, our federal courts have proven to be a secure and effective means for bringing terrorists to justice. To completely foreclose this option is unwise and unnecessary."" Congressional Republicans -- including Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, House Judiciary Committee Chairman Lamar Smith of Texas, House Armed Services Committee Chairman Howard ""Buck"" McKeon of California and House Homeland Security Committee Chairman Peter King of New York -- welcomed the renewal of military commissions. However, McKeon and House Intelligence Committee Chairman Mike Rogers of Michigan criticized Obama for acting on his own instead of working out a policy with Congress. Rogers said he was ""disappointed the White House chose to put another Band-Aid on this problem, rather than working with Congress to develop the comprehensive and long-term legislative framework we need."" McKeon also questioned what the steps announced Monday mean for high-profile detainees such as Mohammed and other September 11 conspirators. The senior administration officials refused to comment on any individual cases. They said they expected new charges against Guantanamo detainees to be filed with military commissions soon, perhaps within days or weeks, and noted that the Obama administration had transferred 67 detainees to third countries so far, leaving a total of 172 in the facility. In addition, the senior administration officials said they would try to repeal the law that prevents the transfer of Guantanamo detainees for trial in the United States. ""Military commissions should proceed in cases where it has been determined appropriate to do so,"" the administration said in an information sheet issued Monday. ""Because there are situations, however, in which our federal courts are a more appropriate forum for trying particular individuals, we will seek repeal of the restrictions imposed by Congress, so that we can move forward in the forum that is, in our judgment, most in line with our national security interests and the interests of justice.""

"A powerful earthquake off the Pacific coast of Guatemala on Wednesday sent debris crashing down onto cars, collapsed roads and killed dozens in the Central American nation, officials said. At least 48 people died in the temblor, President Otto Perez Molina said in a Twitter post Wednesday night, and doctors treated at least 150 others for injuries. Earlier Wednesday, Guatemala's disaster relief agency said 29 people were missing and hundreds had lost their homes. Residents felt the 7.4-magnitude quake throughout Central America and as far north as Mexico City. Its epicenter was about 15 miles off  the western coastal town of Champerico, at a depth of 26 miles. It was the strongest quake to hit Guatemala since 1976, the president told reporters, when a 7.5-magnitude quake killed 23,000 people. ""Fortunately, the damage that we have is not at the same level,"" Perez Molina said Wednesday. iReport: Video from the quake . Roads collapsed in multiple locations around the Pacific coastal region of Guatemala, Perez Molina said. Photos on the Facebook page of the nation's disaster relief agency showed rubble crushing cars and damage to the ceiling at a school in the department of San Marcos. There were reports of homes and schools destroyed in western Guatemala, Perez Molina told CNN en Español. Many people fled buildings when the tremor first hit. Some 60,000 people remained without power in the country because of the quake, the state-run AGN news agency reported. It was fortunate that the school year in Guatemala had recently come to end, so that no children were inside the school buildings that were damaged, Perez Molina said. In Guatemala City, 140 miles away from the quake's epicenter, the quake made the desk and printer sway side to side in Fernando McDonald's home office. McDonald, who shared a video of the quake with CNN's iReport, described the quake as ""strong and long.""

"You -- the person now reading this story -- can help experts solve the mystery of what happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, which disappeared over the open sea. In fact, thousands of aspiring good Samaritans are volunteering their time to scour part of the plane's search zone using detailed satellite images posted online by DigitalGlobe, a Colorado firm that owns one of the world's most advanced commercial satellite networks. So many volunteers have joined the effort that the firm's website -- with its pinpoint pictures of everything floating in the ocean -- has crashed. It is a busy week for ""crowdsourcing,"" the Internet phenomenon where information is gathered from John and Jane Q. Public -- people like you -- and from your social media postings. ""This is a real needle-in-the-haystack problem, except the haystack is in the middle of the ocean,"" Luke Barrington of DigitalGlobe told CNN affiliate KMGH. ""I will ask you to mark anything that looks interesting, any signs of wreckage or life rafts."" DigitalGlobe's satellite photos taken 400 miles above the Gulf of Thailand can capture a detail as small as a home plate. The challenge is finding the manpower to scour 1,235 square miles of such images on one of DigitalGlobe's websites, Tomnod.com -- with more pictures to be posted this week from satellites above the Strait of Malacca, said Abby Van Uum, an Edelman publicist retained by DigitalGlobe. That's where crowdsourcing comes in. Timeline of the flight . ""In many cases, the areas covered are so large, or the things we're looking for are so hard to find, that without the help of hundreds of thousands of people online, we'd never be able to find them,"" Barrington said. One volunteer, Mike Seberger, 43, found a fascinating image in a matter of minutes: the silhouette in the ocean has the scale of a Boeing 777-200, the same model of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370. His discovery can be seen on his CNN iReport page, which is also a form of crowdsourcing used by CNN. ""At first, I skipped past it, thinking, 'Nah. No way I would find anything that quickly,' "" Seberger told CNN on Tuesday. ""But then I kept scrolling back to it and thinking to myself, 'It does resemble a plane....' ""I played with the zoom on my browser a bit, and took a screenshot at 200%, which is what I uploaded"" to CNN iReport, said Seberger, a manager of information technology in the Chicago area. But Seberger does have his doubts: ""Looking at it objectively, the shape of 'my' object appears plane-like and the dimensions are consistent with a 777-200. That said, I feel it is more likely to be a boat."" Four scenarios . DigitalGlobe and the Tomnod.com website officials have yet to respond to his flagging of the curious image. ""Their site is getting slammed, apparently, because about half the time that I try to access it, I get an error page, and sometimes even though I log in, no map loads,"" Seberger said Tuesday. ""The site got slammed like healthcare.gov."" Company officials weren't available to respond to CNN's requests for a comment Tuesday. In response to the Malaysia Airlines plane's disappearance, DigitalGlobe activated its subscription service to emergency managers, which provides online access to satellite images before and after the incident, the firm said on its website. The photos are used for emergency response, damage assessment and recovery. The company performed a similar ""global crowdsourcing campaign"" in November's Typhoon Haiyan in the Philippines, allowing volunteers to tag online more than 60,000 objects of interest from satellite photos. The information was forwarded to emergency responders, the firm said. The firm also tracked damage last year in the Moore, Oklahoma, tornado and the Colorado floods. In another case, the satellite imagery also helped locate the remains of two missing hikers in Peru, the affiliate reported. The firm, based in Longmont, also uses geospatial big data, which is ""information and insight taken from imagery and derived from various sources such as social media,"" the firm said. The company used the technology in satellite images of the recent Sochi Olympics in Russia and cross-referenced the photos with social media data ""to analyze overall activity, linguistic composition and mood for people around Sochi,"" the firm said.

"A new outbreak of a gastrointestinal illness aboard a cruise ship may have been caused by the norovirus, the ship's operator said Wednesday. At least 66 passengers and 17 crew members came down with a quickly spreading digestive bug aboard the Crown Princess, said spokeswoman Karen Candy of Princess Cruises. They have been isolated in their quarters, and the ship has implemented sanitation procedures developed in coordination with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to slow the disease's spread. The Crown Princess, which has room for more than 3,000 passengers, left Los Angeles on Saturday for a seven-day Pacific cruise. Though Princess Cruises believes norovirus is at the root of the outbreak, due to the quick increase in the cases of gastric ailment, Candy did not confirm it as the cause. Norovirus is known for being readily contagious. It causes nausea, vomiting and diarrhea, and is believed to have infected passengers on a number of cruise ships in recent months. In February, 114 passengers and 10 crew members took ill on the Holland America cruise ship ms Veendam during a week long voyage. In January, more than 600 people on cruise ships sailing in the Caribbean fell ill from the virus, the CDC reported. Norovirus infects many people on land, but health officials track it on cruise ships, leading to more frequent reporting of cases, the CDC said. It is passed in person-to-person contact and can spread more easily in closed quarters. How the Navy avoids norovirus . Are cruise ships floating petri dishes?

"Port-au-Prince, Haiti (CNN)  -- High in the hills above the Haitian capital, artist Levoy Exil paints at his terrace studio. The man who began a career using beets, carrots, tomatoes and black beans for paint creates vibrant abstractions of life and nature. A year ago, he infused a celestial oil painting with hues of purplish red -- symbolizing blood -- after he gazed outward and for a moment the verdant landscape turned to black. He knew then that something bad was coming. He saw the blood he had imagined on the streets of Port-au-Prince on January 12 when the earth heaved and 150,000 people perished. It's now apparent that among the earthquake's widespread destruction were museums, galleries and other places that contained Haiti's artistic treasures, including Exil's work. They were a troubled nation's legacy, a key source of economic trade with the rest of the world -- and undeniable symbols of hope. Lost, perhaps, forever. The earthquake's blow to Haitian art is staggering: The Centre d'Art, which launched the Haitian arts movement in the 1940s, is severely damaged. The Musee d'Art Nader, which housed more than 12,000 pieces from the largest private collection in Haiti, collapsed. Murals in the Trinity Cathedral, assembled by some of Haiti's best-known artists, came crashing down. ""There is no art museum run by the government of Haiti,"" said Georges Nader Jr., who runs a gallery near the Nader museum opened by his father. ""This is for me like patrimony for Haiti. We were holding this collection for future generations. What will happen now? I don't know."" The significance of art in Haiti may be hard for outsiders to understand. But with few functioning institutions, few outlets of expression, Haiti's brightly colored depictions -- some laced with spiritual traditions of voodoo culture -- of sun and sea, people and animals serve as memory for a country that has suffered under dictatorships and failed governments and is today the poorest in the Americas. With unemployment as high as 85 percent and a majority of Haitians reeling in abject poverty, art has also emerged as an economic lifeline. ""They're painting their lives. They're recording their history,"" said Camille Scully, executive director of Iowa's Waterloo Center for the Arts and co-president of the Haitian Art Society. ""And they're very accessible because of the colors and style. Everyone who sees Haitian art tends to buy it because they respond to it."" Scully said efforts are under way to enlist conservationists to help Haiti, and a flurry of e-mails shared by collectors, curators, gallery owners and other interested parties show the urgency people are feeling to support the arts community. One key figure who's been weighing in on the need to save what can be saved is Gerald Alexis, a leading Haitian art historian, critic and curator. Haiti has a long enough history of not conserving its art, Alexis said from his Quebec City, Quebec, home. An earthquake in colonial times, fires and hurricanes, as wells as riots, revolutions and government-mandated raids of voodoo temples, destroyed much of the creativity that pre-dated the 1940s artistic boom. For this reason, salvaging art, including the oldest piece in Haiti -- an 1822 painting buried in the national palace -- matters. Haiti's art ""will tell future generations who they are and where they come from,"" Alexis said. ""It's our heritage. And although people think that in poor countries such concepts are unnecessary, they are indeed the only thing we have. Our cultural heritage is our pride."" In Port-au-Prince, Nader has been frantically trying to rescue the thousands of pieces his father lovingly collected over four decades. Among the masters: Hector Hyppolite. Philome Obin. Prefete Duffaut. Wilson Bigaud. Nader pulled out an oil-on-cardboard floral still-life painted by Hyppolite in 1945 that now looks more like a jigsaw puzzle with pieces missing. Some of the artworks housed in the Centre d'Arts, which was in a wooden structure, will be more repairable, he said. What do you do when cement gouges cardboard or canvas? ""This? Only cement can do this,"" he said, picking up some of his punctured pieces. On the day of the quake, Nader's 79-year-old parents were in their bedroom on the top floor of the building that houses the museum. They were pulled from the rubble after the museum collapsed. Nader could not hold back tears when he thought of the suffering around him and stopped the conversation to recompose himself. The cultural loss can hardly compare. ""At that time, the paintings were my last concern,"" he continued. ""There were lives at stake."" But since then, he has been going back to the rubble every day to salvage what he can. He knows he has to -- for the sake of his country. On the second floor of his gallery, he and his staff have been collecting damaged pieces, their vibrant colors dulled by the dust. ""This is like a hospital for paintings,"" he said, watching his staff strip off frames and backings. He picked up a damaged portrait of a fruit vendor by Antonio Joseph. He grew to manhood looking at the painting on his bedroom wall. It's one of his favorites. So far, Nader has rescued about 1,000 pieces; 70 percent need restoration. That was one room in the museum. Kent Shankle, the curator for Iowa's Waterloo Center for the Arts, which houses the largest public collection of Haitian art in the United States, said he hopes there is a silver lining to the tragedy. ""Hopefully this is raising awareness and shedding light on both the beauty of Haiti and its people, as well as the incredible needs there,"" he said. And, perhaps it will fuel a new wave of art that reveals the resilience of people here. ""We've survived. It's a blessing,"" said artist Jean Louis Maxan. Maxan depicted Jean-Bertrand Aristide's exit from Haiti in 2004, an acrylic-on-canvas painting of ""American Air"" waiting to take the disgraced president away. Now, he said, he will paint people screaming, piles of bodies and tents blanketing the city's open spaces. High above the misery, Exil, too, said he will paint again. When nature tells him it is right. ""It's a great loss for all of us,"" Exil said of the earthquake. ""But life continues and we will continue to create."" He will rely on the lush, undulating landscape before him. The sun and the moon. And the distant sea. He will make beauty blossom from the ugliness below. For the future of Haiti.

"As darkness falls, Joy Friedman hits the streets -- the same ones she used to troll for customers while working as a prostitute. ""My last trick was turned behind that storefront,"" she said, gesturing to a nearby building. Now the survivor of sex trafficking cruises these neighborhoods with a different purpose. She's looking for women and girls who are caught up in this lifestyle so she can offer them free condoms and hygiene products. She is also delivering a message: There is help for them if they want it. Friedman works for Breaking Free, a nonprofit that helps women escape prostitution. It's where she got help 13 years ago. ""(Prostitution) has been happening forever. And forever, women have just been the victims of it,"" said Vednita Carter, the organization's founder. ""They deserve better."" Since 1996, Carter says she has helped more than 6,000 women get the support they need. In the process, she's built an army of survivors who have joined her crusade to end sex trafficking. Lured into 'the life' Carter personally knows about this world. At 18, she was hoping to make money for college when she responded to an advertisement for ""dancers."" At first, she danced fully clothed, but her bosses and then-boyfriend soon pressured her into stripping and, eventually, prostitution. It was more than a year before Carter called a friend who helped her get back on her feet. Later, she realized how lucky she had been. ""The majority of women don't have anyone to call. There is nowhere for them to turn,"" said Carter, now 60. ""That's why I do this work."" Do you know a hero? Nominations are open for 2014 CNN Heroes . For many of the women Carter helps, ""the life"" is all they've known. Studies show that the average age of entry into child prostitution is 12 to 14, and many of the girls have been sexually abused or were runaways. Carter works to educate the public and law enforcement to see these women as victims of sex trafficking rather than as criminals. ""Prostitution and sex trafficking really are the same thing. It's about buying and selling a human being,"" she said. Leaving 'the life' behind . Carter says 95% of the women she helps struggle with addiction as well as physical abuse, mental trauma, financial instability and shame. ""It's a process. If (they've) been in it forever, it's all they know,"" she said. ""They think it's their destiny."" Carter's drop-in center provides food, clothing and emotional support to any woman coming off the street, no strings attached. For many women, the first significant step is to participate in a 14-week class called Sisters of Survival. Graduates are honored in a ceremony, marking the start of their new lives. CNN Money: Inside the underground sex economy . ""They learn that they do have other choices that (they) can make,"" Carter said. The group also provides permanent and temporary housing, addiction counseling, job skills training and legal assistance. Most of the staffers who work at Breaking Free are survivors of prostitution, making it one of just a few organizations like it in the United States. ""I have a purpose now,"" Friedman said. ""I'm a fighter, and I'm going to fight 'til I die for each and every person involved in sexual exploitation."" Fighting the demand . Carter believes that sex trafficking won't end until men stop purchasing sexual favors. She established one of the country's first ""John Schools"" that educates men arrested for solicitation about the impact of their actions. ""I'm not here to make you feel like a piece of sh*t, but you've got to feel something,"" Doris Johnson, a survivor, told a group back in 2012. ""That's somebody's daughter."" According to Carter's group, only 2% of the men who complete the course reoffend. Carter is considered by many to be a pioneer in the anti-sex trafficking movement, and she is determined to keep fighting as long as she can. ""We are really raising an army here. And this is a battle,"" she said. ""It's not OK to buy and sell us. We are not for sale."" Want to get involved?

"(CNN) -- Blanche Lincoln The League of Conservation Voters has targeted the senator from Arkansas by placing her name on the ""Dirty Dozen"" list of candidates it hopes to defeat in mid-term elections. Politico.com reports that the environmentalist advocacy group selected Lincoln, a Democrat up for re-election this year, because she opposed passing comprehensive climate legislation and for supporting Alaska Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski's resolution that would prevent the Environmental Protection Agency from regulating greenhouse gas emissions. According to Politico, the League raised more than $1.5 million to topple candidates in the last election. The Hill reports that Lincoln is fighting back. ""I have built a practical, common-sense record on energy and environmental issues while working closely with Arkansas environmental advocates,"" Lincoln said in a released statement.

Salinger never gave interviews or appeared in public, and ""in keeping with his lifelong, uncompromising desire to protect and defend his privacy there will be no service,"" according to a family statement that his literary agent, Phyllis Westberg, provided Thursday. He wrote more than 30 short stories and a handful of novellas, many published in The New Yorker and collected in works such as ""Nine Stories"" and ""Seymour: An Introduction."" But Salinger's fame rests on ""Catcher,"" his only novel. The book is narrated by a teenage boy, Holden Caulfield, who is expelled from fictional Pencey Prep, a private school in Pennsylvania.

For example: Why do some children become autistic when others do not? How can understanding what goes wrong in autistic brain development help us to understand what goes right in normal brain development? Matthew Belmonte, an assistant professor of human development at Cornell University, received a National Science Foundation award of $700,000 -- funded by stimulus dollars -- to study the differences in autistic and non-autistic brains. To do this, children in both categories are undergoing experiments embedded within video games with science fiction themes. Once the kids learn the games, Belmonte and his team will study their brains using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and high-density electroencephalography (EEG). Belmonte says that his research is driven by personal circumstances. He told the Science Works for U.S. Web site, ""I was always fascinated by order and regularity,"" and as a child, he shared that fascination with his older brother, who has autism.

"Cautious doctors replacing former Vice President Dick Cheney's heart defibrillator in 2007 modified it so it couldn't be hacked by terrorists who might try to kill him, Cheney told CNN's Sanjay Gupta in an interview that aired Sunday night on CBS' ""60 Minutes."" Cheney's cardiologist, Dr. Jonathan Reiner, was interviewed along with his famous patient. ""It seemed to me to be a bad idea for the vice president of the United States to have a device that maybe somebody ... might be able to get into, hack into,"" Reiner said. Turning to Cheney, the cardiologist added: ""I worried that someone could kill you."" So, when Cheney needed his implanted defibrillator replaced in 2007, Reiner ordered the manufacturer to disable the wireless feature, thus preventing anyone from sending a signal to the device and shocking the vice president into cardiac arrest. Gupta's interview with Cheney and Reiner will air Tuesday on CNN's ""Anderson Cooper 360."" Cheney is the author of a new book, ""Heart: An American Medical Odyssey,"" co-written by Reiner. It's described as a medical tale that looks at breakthroughs in cardiac care over the past 40 years. It's also a story about how Cheney's heart disease overlapped with key moments in history. Case in point: Around 9/11, Cheney said, there was no time to worry about his health. He'd already had several heart attacks by that point. ""I didn't think about my health. I was thinking about the problem we were dealing with,"" Cheney said. But life has a persistent way of intruding -- and intrude his heart problems did -- many times over Cheney's long political career. Just about two months after taking the oath as vice president, Cheney wrote a secret letter of resignation. It was pending for the entire time he served. Cheney wrote the letter because he saw a gap in the U.S. Constitution. If a vice president is alive but incapacitated, there's nothing in the Constitution that allows for that person's removal. Worried that he might find himself in that position, he penned the letter. Cheney unapologetic in documentary . The 72-year-old Cheney suffered his first heart attack in 1978, at age 37, while campaigning for Congress. It was the first of five heart attacks. He suffered subsequent heart attacks in 1984, 1988, 2000 and 2010. Cheney also underwent an open heart surgery and had a pacemaker implanted. In 2010, Cheney had a left ventricular assist device, or LVAD, implanted to help his heart pump. The LVAD, a battery-operated heart pump, is basically used to buy people time -- a last resort, if you will -- while they await a new heart. Cheney waited 20 months for a transplant, undergoing the procedure last year. After appearing frail and weak, he now seems full of energy and is back to a normal weight. His color has returned and he has no shortness of breath. Gupta: Three things I learned about Dick Cheney . Asked by Gupta how he is feeling, Cheney said ""fantastic."" ""Now I'm to the point where -- I literally, you know, feel like I have a new heart, a lot more energy than I had previously. There aren't any real physical limits on what I do. I fish, I hunt. And -- I don't ski, but that's because of my knees, not my heart. So it's -- it's been a miracle,"" he sahttp://www.secure-medicine.org/public/publications/icd-study.pdfid. It's like having a new lease on life. ""You wake up every morning with a smile on your face because you've got a new day you never expected to have. And there's a sense, well, of wonderment. Nothing short of magical,"" Cheney said. Dick Cheney: Fast Facts . Bush had 95% blockage before August heart procedure . Hacking a defibrillator may sound improbable, but researchers have demonstrated that it is possible. Tadayoshi Kohno, associate professor of computer science and engineering at the University of Washington, and colleagues showed in a 2008 study that they could use their own hardware to communicate with an implantable cardioverter deﬁbrillator. ""We wanted to get ahead of any potential threat,"" Kohno said. ""We knew that medical devices were advancing, and we wanted to get the medical device community focused on understanding the risks, so that future medical devices with more wireless communication capabilities, and so on, were adequately secured."" It wasn't easy, Kohno said, but by studying the signals that hospital equipment would normally send to the device, researchers were able to figure out how to generate their own signals to communicate with it. From a few centimeters away from the device, they could change the defibrillator's settings and turn its therapies on and off, Kohno said. The device was the current model at the time, but now represents an older generation of such devices. The FDA considers the security of medical devices to be an important issue, Kohno said, and the medical community is working on figuring out how to improve them. In the meantime, though, the risk for most people is incredibly low, Kohno said. ""If I had any medical reason to get an implantable defibrillator or a pacemaker, I would have no hesitation in doing so, even the one that we studied,"" Kohno said. ""These are lifesaving devices and truly the benefits outweigh the risks.""

"The first time you see this bizarre aircraft floating high above the horizon, you may be confused. It looks kind of like a giant, winged doughnut. It's 35 feet wide, and inventors call it the BAT. It's an unmanned, helium-filled, cylindrical blimp wrapped around three spinning blades that turn wind into electricity. Can the BAT, which stands for buoyant airborne turbine, help bring life-saving electricity to an estimated 1 billion people in rural areas where power is unavailable? Altaeros Energies, launched four years ago by a group of MIT grads, hopes so. The young company is competing with Google and other outfits trying to bring the first viable airborne wind turbine to market. The sight of whirling wind turbine blades sitting atop towers has become common in states such as California and Texas and in Europe. But the BAT takes wind turbine technology to the next level, literally -- about 1,000 feet above the ground. Towers are often too low to catch the best winds. By flying remote-controlled wind turbines where winds are stronger and more consistent, a lot more energy can be harvested, and it's clean energy from an endless source. It's a dramatic idea that could change the course of countless lives around the planet. Suddenly, with airborne wind turbines, isolated communities in South American jungles or Alaskan islands could have easier, cheaper access to technology that most take for granted. For those people, the cost of electric light and heat would plummet because fossil fuels for electric generators wouldn't have to be imported. Electricity would be available to pump clean water from central wells, preventing waterborne diseases. Refrigeration would be possible in hot climates to keep food fresh and store life-saving prescription drugs. Even cell phone communications might be possible in some places, if cellular repeaters could be integrated into the high-flying turbines. Experts offer three reasons why airborne wind turbines might work for remote areas: . • They're portable. • They're computer controlled, requiring no onboard pilots and few operators. • No expensive infrastructure, such as electrical grids or power stations, is required. So now, the race is on to figure out the best design for these aerial power generators. Would it look like an airplane? Google-owned Makani Power in California is working on one. Or would it look more like a winged blimp? A firm out of Canada called LTA Windpower is working on that idea. Perhaps the answer will be a huge kite, such as they've got at Berlin-based EnerKite. Or maybe the BAT will do the trick. Altaeros and the Golden Valley Electric Association in Fairbanks, Alaska, are planning to partner on an 18-month test run, beginning sometime in 2015. Electricity in some remote parts of Alaska can cost more than four times the U.S. average of 13.4 cents per kilowatt hour. That's because many Alaskan communities are far from electrical power grids -- the infrastructure networks that connect electricity to consumers. Without a grid, the cost of hauling in fossil fuels to run electric generators is huge. ""In Alaska, we have a very small electrical grid,"" said Golden Valley systems manager Paul Morgan. ""When people live away from that, they generate their own power in all these villages, and that's pretty expensive."" The BAT, Altaeros says, is portable enough to pack into two small shipping containers. It can be set up without heavy machinery in about a day. The thing flies via its helium-filled doughnut-shaped body. It's connected to the ground at all times by strong tethers, which carry electricity to a portable ground station. The tethers also are connected to a computer-controlled automated system that optimizes the BAT's height, based on changing winds. During operation, no crew is required, Altaeros says. It can be monitored remotely and maintained with periodic on-site inspections. The ground station can be connected to a power grid, or a local micro-grid, or customer equipment, Altaeros says. Each BAT can crank out enough power for 12 homes, the company says. During dangerous weather, the BAT is designed to reel itself down to the ground. Its spinning blades don't pose a significant threat to birds and bats, Altaeros says, because critters don't usually fly as high as the turbines. And what about nearby airplanes? Existing federal rules allow the BAT to fly nearly 2,000 feet high, below most flight patterns. The turbines include safety lights and locator beacons to warn passing aircraft. Here's a brief look at the BAT's competitors: . Google's Makani turbine . The Makani Turbine got its name from the Hawaiian word for wind. This turbine differs from the BAT because it flies more like an airplane. The plane has propellers on its wing and launches from a nearby ground station tower. While tethered to the tower, the Makani continuously circles in a vertical loop while it generates electricity. When it's finished, the Makani flies itself back to the tower. Development of the Makani started with inflatable fabric kites. But five years ago, engineers switched to a more reliable rigid airframe made from lightweight carbon fiber. The commercial turbine now under development has the wingspan of an airliner and the weight of a Mini Cooper, and it can withstand the G-forces of a fighter jet, Makani says. The kite . Germany's EnerKite, founded in 2010, is developing a wind turbine that flies on a kite. ""It will be a mono-wing, like a kite rather than an airplane,"" said co-founder and CEO Alexander Bormann. The design calls for the kite to be controlled by a bridle and connected by tethers to a ground station. Bormann says he expects to begin product sales in 2016. The PowerShip . In Ontario, LTA Windpower's PowerShip concept is basically a blimp with wings and two spinning propellers. What sets this idea apart is the type of buoyant gas that would allow it to fly: hydrogen. Company founder and CEO Nykolai Bilaniuk acknowledges that using hydrogen, which is more flammable than helium, ""is potentially dangerous."" However, he said, ""we have to decide what would be sufficient to mitigate the risk."" A specially designed envelope surrounding the hydrogen would protect the gas from igniting. Also, Bilaniuk says that hydrogen is cheaper than helium and can be created on-site. ""You can electrolyze water using some of your own electrical output from the generator,"" he said. It's possible that all of these technologies may eventually find a place in the growing wind turbine landscape. If the concept of flying wind turbines fulfills its promise, by the end of the decade innovators may transform this big idea into reality while ushering some of the world's most isolated communities into the 21st century.","Engineers race to develop unmanned flying machine that turns wind to electricity .

"When I started my initiative that led to the creation of Grameen Bank, my ambition was small and simple -- to help the poor people in Jobra, a village in Bangladesh. I thought if I could give them access to a small amount of money, maybe their lives could change for the better. I never imagined the scale of impact that idea would have today. Watch video: Yunus on how we can create social fiction . I began my work in the 1970s when I was teaching at a university in Bangladesh. The economic theories that I had learned stopped ringing true for me when I saw the misery of people all around me. I decided that I would drop the theories and go out to see if I could help just one person a day in the village outside of the university. After talking with some women, I found out how they became victims of money lenders in carrying out their livelihood pursuits. They were forced to pay exorbitant interest rates and subjected to other oppressive terms on the tiny loans they were given. I thought I can protect them by offering the loans myself. I gave 42 people a total of $27 of my own money as loan to solve their problems. They used that to free themselves from the loan sharks and were able to pay me back later. From this tiny experience, Grameen Bank was born. Over the course of three decades, through this bank, we lent to more than 8.4 million borrowers in Bangladesh, giving them fair loans and a fair chance to climb out of poverty. Unlike banks in the traditional system, Grameen works on the assumption that even the poorest of the poor can manage their own financial affairs given the right conditions. Starting loans are about $40. Today, the average loan is just about $200 and our repayment rates are at 97%. Our borrowers are mainly women (97%). They own this bank by buying shares of the bank with funds from their savings accounts in the bank. This system was designed to ensure that the bank focus on alleviating poverty as well as its commitment to addressing the needs of its clients. Microfinance is now a well-known term. It has evolved on a much larger global scale with microfinance institutions to extend loans to more than 160 million people. It has affected the lives of about 1 billion people in developing countries. During my journey to build up Grameen Bank, I also created many other self-sustaining enterprises to address the problems faced by the people we worked with -- the rural poor. That was the start of social business -- a new type of business that focuses on solving social problems, rather than just making money, which I later elaborated in my book, ""Creating a World without Poverty and Building Social Business."" A social business offers an alternative to the capitalist model. The essence of social business is to create a business that is focused on solving human problems rather than making a personal profit. It is a nondividend company designed to address a social objective within the framework of existing marketplace. It is different from a nonprofit because the business should seek to generate a modest profit, which would be used to expand the company's reach and improve the product or service. Social business has to be sustainable and is able to return the amount invested. But investors do not receive any further dividend after that point. I have created many such enterprises. In recent years, many international businesses became interested in collaborating with us -- including Danone, Veolia, BASF, Uniqlo, McCain, BR Foods and Intel. We set up joint ventures with them, making use of their technological expertise to solve problems such as malnutrition, unclean drinking water, mosquito-borne diseases, unemployment and maternal health issues. We also created some successful standalone social businesses such as Grameen Shakti, which supplies solar energy to off-grid villages, and Grameen Eye Care Hospital, which provides affordable cataract surgeries and other eye care treatments in rural areas. Glasgow Caledonian University has teamed up with us to establish a nursing college, offering tertiary education to rural village girls. In 2010, I met Saskia Bruysten who, coming from a management consulting background, shared in the belief of bringing a business approach to solving social issues. Together we created Yunus Social Business, an incubator fund that lends to social business entrepreneurs around the world. YSB's concept is simple. We select the most promising business plans created by local people that are designed to solve local problems in a sustainable way. After recouping the initial investment, all profits will be reinvested into the business or used in some way to benefit the customers. YSB makes investments in such businesses through its fund and takes no profits. Everything goes back to the community. Since 2011, YSB has grown rapidly and is operating in eight countries (Haiti, Albania, Brazil, Costa Rica, Colombia, India, Tunisia and Uganda). With the world population crossing 7 billion people, it is more crucial than ever that we re-evaluate the concept of capitalism. Will we continue to sacrifice the environment, our health and our children's future in the relentless pursuit of personal profit and power? Or will we take the destiny of the planet into our hands by reimagining a world where we put the needs of all people at the center? Will our sustainable business model without seeking personal profit become a means to achieving those needs? I have come far on my journey from lending $27 to 42 people in Jobra. But my ambition remains the same: Can I empower the poor to change their circumstances and bring the power of business to solve problems by reorienting people from profit-seeking to enjoying the pleasure of being a creator of a better world?  This is the mission of Yunus Social Business and the journey I continue.","Muhammad Yunus: I started Grameen Bank with the simple idea of helping the poor .

"There's a scene in my satirical film ""Dear White People"" in which social misfit Lionel Higgins is asked to write a black culture piece by the editor of a campus newspaper staffed with mostly white people. Lionel accepts the assignment with some trepidation. Despite the benefit of being black, large Afro and all, he feels underqualified, because he has yet to find a pocket of culture he identifies with at the fictional Winchester University. Lionel's dilemma is one many black Americans share: a deep desire to have an identity rooted in black culture coupled with the knowledge that what's seen as ""authentically black"" in popular culture doesn't reflect our actual experience. We're left in a sort of no-man's land, because we don't often see ourselves reflected in mainstream culture, nor in popular ""Black Culture."" In making the film and engaging in debates about the state of ""black film,"" here are five things I've come to know about black culture now: . 1. There is a difference between black culture and ""Black Culture"" Black culture, sans quotes, is the sum total of cultural contributions to the mainstream by the black subculture. It's a fluid and a multifaceted, often contradictory thing. Meanwhile ""Black Culture"" is a lifestyle standard made of assumptions about black identity, often used successfully by marketers, studio heads, fashion brands and music labels to make money. It can be the ""cool factor"" that makes kids line up for hours to spend their last dime on brand new Michael Jordan sneakers. Or the thing that makes white people call me ""brotha"" and blast 2 Chainz when I hop in the car. It's what people assume about black people and how they should sound, live and act. Black culture may have been born in black communities, or created by black Americans. But when appropriated for commerce, there is a danger of mistaking ""Black Culture"" for actual cultural EXPERIENCE. That's where the myth begins, and it can devalue real human experiences. 2.  ""Black Culture"" oftentimes employs, but is not always defined by, actual black people . Often by the time ""Black Culture"" is being used to sell a product or idea, it's already been reinterpreted by white people. This isn't necessarily malicious, but it's something to note. We are often told what being black is by people who aren't. Up and coming black hip hop artists are molded to appeal to the masses by white label executives. Television shows with black characters might have no black writers or directors. I'm reminded of a time in college when a white roommate insisted he was ""blacker"" than I was, by showing me he could successfully ""crip walk.""  It was a feat I could not do, nor cared to match. But in that moment I was made to wonder if I was indeed ""black"" enough, despite being the only actual black person present. In that moment,  I felt alienated by a culture I had a need to be rooted in. The black experience can sometimes be so concretely defined in the mainstream that it feels suffocating. The reality of being black is much more nuanced and fluid. 3. Black culture is multicultural . Black culture draws from a variety of influences born both in and outside black communities. Janelle Monae's album ""Electric Lady"" demonstrates this: It is a brilliant amalgamation of artistic references as disparate as Motown and Fritz Lang's Metropolis. Being black in America involves a process of moving through and adopting from many different cultures. To define what's authentically black is virtually impossible, as there are as many ways to be black as there are black people. 4. Black culture is not proprietary to black people . Many observers had a tough time when rapper Macklemore & Ryan Lewis won the Grammy for best rap album over Kendrick Lamar. There is similar discontent over the lack of black artists being recognized or rotated on radio in categories once ""owned"" by black musicians, like R&B or hip hop. But this is not new. Once communities of black artists birth something to the mass culture, in many ways it is no longer ours. For every Dizzy Gillespie there is a Dave Brubeck. It can be a tough pill to swallow. Particularly when a culture we feel ownership over reaches new heights of success in more mainstream, i.e. whiter, hands. There is something unsettling about the fact that black artists doing things associated with ""Black Culture"" (rapping, twerking,) doesn't seem to capture the mainstream's attention as potently as when white artists do it. (See: Miley Cyrus). Personally, I happen to enjoy both Kendrick Lamar and Macklemore -- Brubeck and Gillespie -- and even a couple of Hall & Oates jams from time to time. But I don't define my black experience in something as transient as music or fashion. I get much more infuriated when presented with an overtly defined and limited depiction of what being black represents. Like being told I ""talk white"" in school. Or McRibs commercials. Or, more egregiously, seeing white kids in college dress as black stereotypes and post pictures of it on Facebook on a day meant to honor a civil rights icon. 5. Black culture is a starting point . Culture of any kind can be grounding and comforting, creating a home for nourishment and rules for understanding ourselves. But at a certain point a cultural identity too tightly defined keeps us from growing. I'm grounded in, but not limited by, my blackness. When I began trying to get my film made, the confines of ""Black Culture"" seemed to suggest that if a black movie wasn't broadly comedic, a historical epic tragedy or a street story, there would be no audience for it. But I made it anyway. After millions of YouTube views for the trailer, and several sold-out screenings at Sundance, my quirky rumination on race and identity has been warmly received by audiences and critics of all races. And that is really the genesis of any culture: Ultimately, it's created by individuals and communities with the courage to do something different and unexpected. Like be themselves.","Director of satirical film ""Dear White People"" shares 5 things to know about black culture .

"They are the latest political pawns in a partisan battle over U.S. immigration: Thousands of children who have risked their lives fleeing poverty and violence in Central America seeking ""permisos"" or a pass to stay in America. It is a political chimera that touches on thorny issues like immigration reform, foreign aid, human trafficking and the U.S.-Latin American drug trade, which has helped fund violent Central American cartels that are destabilizing that region, federal officials told lawmakers at a House Homeland Security Committee hearing on Tuesday. During the session, the partisan differences on immigration reform and border security were stark. ""Why aren't we putting them on a bus like we normally do and send them back down to Guatemala?"" Alabama Republican Rep. Mike Rogers asked about the children pouring across the southern border and being held in detention facilities. ""Because the law requires that I turn them over to (Health and Human Services) sir,"" responded Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson. ""Well the law required Obamacare to be kicked in two years ago and that hasn't stopped the administration before when it wants to do something different,"" Rogers replied. ""This is a humanitarian crisis. ... It is a national security crisis for our country and I don't know why these children are being treated any differently."" And so it went as lawmakers and federal officials went round and round, hotly debating how best to deal with the thousands of children awaiting their fate in hot, cramped detention facilities and the thousands more expected to flood the southern border by the end of the year. ""This is a crisis. It is a crisis that has been in the making for years, one that we should have seen coming but few concrete actions have been taken,"" said committee Chairman  Michael McCaul. ""The Department of Homeland Security and the United States government as a whole has been slow to act, turning a blind eye to the warning signs,"" the Texas Republican said. ""The tragic fact is these children are making a dangerous journey based on misinformation and the false promise of amnesty."" Immigrant children tread treacherous political landscape . Partisan back and forth . Republicans blame the White House and say relaxed deportation policies toward immigrant kids and their families are encouraging an estimated 60,000 Central American children who, federal law enforcement agents say, will cross the southern border into the United States this year. ""I think this humanitarian crisis can be laid directly at the feet of the President and his policy in 2012,"" said Rep. Candice Miller, a Michigan Republican. She was referring to a program backed by the Obama administration that defers deportation for children brought to the United States previously by their parents or guardians illegally. Though most of the children pouring across the border now would not qualify for ""amnesty"" under the policy, immigration law and policy experts say there is strong evidence to suggest the administration's position motivated others to make the difficult journey to the United States in the hopes that they will be granted a similar reprieve. ""What is critical here is that we correct the record, we straighten the misperceptions,"" Johnson told the committee. ""The smuggling operations are creating a misinformation campaign that there is a 'permisos', or free pass."" Influx of immigrant children expected to last through summer . President Barack Obama and fellow Democrats blame House Republicans, for refusing to take up a Senate-passed comprehensive immigration reform package last year and for continued fighting over incremental proposals. They also stress that the surge of children on the nation's southern border is a multi-faceted problem. ""Those out there who are looking for simple answers to lay the blame on President Obama's policy on deferred action for childhood arrivals, or even the Senate passed comprehensive immigration reform legislation, I would note that neither would apply to these kids,"" said Rep. Bennie Thompson, the panel's top Democrat. ""Hence the assertion that the recent surge in unaccompanied children is due to lax immigration enforcement does not pass the smell test."" An analysis by the Migration Policy Institute, found that the ""deep root causes for this child migration, and for the recent surge in arrivals"" are complex. ""In reality, there is no single cause. Instead, a confluence of different pull and push factors has contributed to the upsurge,"" the report found. ""Recent U.S. policies toward unaccompanied children, faltering economies and rising crime and gang activity in Central American countries, the desire for family reunification, and changing operations of smuggling networks have all converged."" A multi-faceted problem . In the meantime, the administration is trying to stem the problem on several fronts by employing a multi-agency approach and drawing on Homeland Security, Federal Emergency Management Agency and U.S. Customs and Border Protection, among others. Should Obama use the power of his pen to turn the tide on immigration reform? Obama has spoken with Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto about that nation's role in helping to quell the problem. Vice President Joe Biden also has traveled to Guatemala to discuss strategies for stemming the problem with Central American leaders. Johnson, who will travel to Guatemala later this summer, also made a public service announcement in Spanish and English last week aimed at Central American parents. He stressed that sending their children to smugglers who then sneak them across the border is dangerous and illegal. The administration is aggressively working to break up smuggling rings which, Johnson said have a financial incentive to spread misinformation about amnesty for children immigrating to the country illegally. He told the congressional panel that he is also weighing sending more border patrol agents to the frontlines of the problem. White House to spend millions to curb undocumented children crossing border . The administration unveiled a plan to spend roughly $100 million in aid to Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador to help the children reintegrate and remain in their home countries once they are sent back by the United States, according to a White House statement. The administration also announced it will set aside $161.5 million this year for programs aimed at helping countries in that region better ""respond to the region's most pressing security and governance challenges."" Republicans want the administration to do more. ""Instead of increasing funding we need to stop U.S. aid in the centrals,"" Miller said. ""I would say no more money from America until they step up to their own responsibilities and stop their citizens from migrating to the United States. ... We need to whack our neighbors to make sure they understand they're not going to be taking our money. We are not the ATM machine.""","Members of Congress, Obama administration in partisan debate over immigrant kid surge .

"One of the cooler experiences I've had in recent memory was meeting Elsie Nanugaq Tommy, a spry 104-year-old who started a secret women's shelter decades ago out of her home in Newtok, Alaska. She's a bundle of smiles and optimism -- and her legacy of helpfulness already has been passed down to her granddaughter, Denise Tommy, who is executive director of the Tundra Women's Coalition in Bethel, Alaska, which shelters women and fights violence with educational programs. You should join them in helping to make Alaska a safer place. I recently traveled to the 49th state to try to figure out why it has the highest rate of reported rape in the nation -- and what could be done to change that. Read about the trip at CNN.com/Change. (Readers voted for me to cover this topic as part of CNN's Change the List project). And then do something about it. Alaska doesn't have to be the state where rape is most common. The lawless 'end of the land' Here are five simple ways you can help make a difference: . 1. Donate to worthy organizations . I came across a number of responsible, effective organizations in Alaska that are working to shelter rape victims and get people talking about what Gov.  Sean Parnell called Alaska's ""epidemic"" of rape and domestic violence. Here are four that take online donations and were vetted by Rebecca Angel Baer, from CNN's Impact Your World group: . • Alaska Network on Domestic Violence and Sexual Assault . • Aiding Women in Abuse and Rape Emergencies, or AWARE . • Standing Together Against Rape, or STAR . • Rape, Abuse and Incest National Network, or RAINN . 2. Start a petition to get cops in every village . There are 75 villages in Alaska with no local law enforcement presence. I visited one such village, called Nunam Iqua, which means ""end of the land"" in Yupik, and learned it can take state troopers hours or even four or five days to respond to emergency calls there. Rape and domestic violence can become normal in such a place. There's a simple solution: Send Village Public Safety Officers, who are unarmed but trained, to the lawless villages. Sexual assault cases are 3½ times as likely to be prosecuted in villages with a VPSO, according to the University of Alaska Anchorage Justice Center. If you want to see VPSOs in every village in Alaska, including Nunam Iqua, I'd encourage you to start a petition at Change.org or We the People. If you do, please send me the link on Twitter (@jdsutter), and I'll add the link here so other readers can sign it. States where rape is most common . 3. Tell your story as part of ""We are the 59%"" Fifty-nine percent of women in Alaska will be raped, assaulted, beaten or threatened with violence in their lifetimes, according to a statewide survey. Stand in solidarity with this majority of Alaskan women by sharing your story of survival. Breaking the silence will help end the epidemic by reminding victims that they are not to blame -- and empowering them to have their voices heard. I met several victims of rape and domestic violence in Alaska who told me their personal healing started when they realized they weren't alone. Visit this CNN.com page to share your story and read other submissions. 4. Host a ""Choose Respect"" rally (from your phone) Parnell, the governor, is trying to get the state talking about domestic violence and sexual assault by encouraging people all over Alaska to hold ""Choose Respect"" rallies in their communities on March 27. The idea is for men to choose respect for women rather than using violence against them. I think the statement can also be read as a demand from any person that the rest of society chooses respect for them and everyone else. Hold your own mini-""Choose Respect"" rally taking a photo of yourself and uploading it to Twitter, Facebook or Instagram with the hashtag #chooserespect. Bonus points: Write ""Choose Respect"" on your hand. Your photos will show up on this page. If you're in Alaska, visit this website for info on how to hold a rally. Alaska faces its 'resident evil' 5. Demand rape kits are counted and tested . More cases of reported rape need to be prosecuted -- and offenders need to be convicted. Otherwise, men assume they can rape with impunity. According to RAINN's founder and president, Scott Berkowitz, 40% of rapes are reported and just 3% result in the offender spending so much as a day behind bars. One way to improve justice for rape survivors is to ensure that forensic evidence collected from crime scenes is tested. There are massive backlogs of so-called ""rape kits"" across the country. Hundreds of thousands of kits are untested, activists say, in part because doing so is expensive, and sometimes because these cases aren't given priority. Testing the kits, meanwhile, can result in offenders being charged and convicted. Katie TePas, a senior policy adviser and Alaska's ""Choose Respect"" coordinator, said Alaska's backlog of forensic evidence ""has been drastically reduced"" in recent years. ""I do not think we are in dire straits, unlike some other states,"" she said. Orin Dym, the forensic laboratory manager at the Alaska Scientific Crime Detection Laboratory, said his statewide lab currently has 141 ""unassigned requests"" for sexual assault kit analysis. It's possible, he said, law enforcement agencies have additional backlogs they never sent to his lab in Anchorage for analysis. The governor's fiscal year 2015 budget would include $115,000 to speed up the processing of the evidence, TePas and Dym said. Alaska, according to endthebacklog.org and TePas, is part of the majority of states not providing data on the number of untested rape kits and not having legislation to ensure the forensic evidence is tested. You can demand that rape kits in Alaska or in your home state are tested by sending a letter to your elected representatives. EndtheBacklog.org makes it easy to petition your elected officials. 5.1.

"Armed drones. Mass graves. Kirkuk's effective annexation. The Iraq crisis escalated Friday. A U.S. official confirmed to CNN that armed American drones started flying over Baghdad in the previous 24 hours to provide additional protection for 180 U.S. military advisers in the area. Until now, U.S. officials had said all drone reconnaissance flights over Iraq were unarmed. Using the drones for any offensive strikes against insurgent Islamic State in Iraq and Syria fighters would continue to require approval from U.S. President Barack Obama. Also on Friday, Kurdish leader Masoud Barzani said disputed areas in northern Iraq, including the oil-rich city of Kirkuk, are part of the Kurdish autonomous region from now on after the Iraqi central government failed to hold a long-awaited referendum. Earlier this month, the Iraqi army withdrew from Kirkuk and Kurdish Peshmerga forces took control of the city and small villages in the areas as ISIS carried out a lightning offensive and took several cities in northern Iraq. Barzani: 'We have waited for more than 10 years' The move could complicate efforts by the United States and its allies to get Iraqi leaders to form a new government representing all three major population groups -- Sunnis, Shias and Kurds. Barzani, the President of the Kurdistan region, cited the failure by the Iraqi government to hold a constitutionally mandated referendum on the status of Kirkuk and nearby villages. ""We have waited for more than 10 years for the Iraqi federal government to address and solve the issue of these areas covered by Article 140, but it was of no avail,"" Barzani said at a joint appearance with British Foreign Secretary William Hague. According to Article 140 of the 2005 Iraqi Constitution, which was drawn up two years after the ouster of Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein, a referendum would determine the final status of several disputed areas such as Kirkuk and small villages in Nineveh, Diyala and Salaheddin claimed by the central government and the Kurdistan regional government. However, the vote never took place because of instability in most of the disputed areas. MAPS: How to understand the Iraq crisis . The news came on the same day that Human Rights Watch said two mass graves believed to contain the bodies of Iraqi soldiers, police and civilians killed by the Sunni ISIS fighters and their militant allies have been discovered in Hussein's hometown of Tikrit. Claims of atrocities by both sides have increased as the conflict widens in Iraq. Reports of killings 'deeply alarming' Earlier Friday, Amnesty International released a report saying it has evidence pointing to a pattern of ""extrajudicial executions"" of Sunni detainees by government forces and Shiite militias in the northern Iraqi cities of Tal Afar, Mosul and Baquba. ""Reports of multiple incidents where Sunni detainees have been killed in cold blood while in the custody of Iraqi forces are deeply alarming,"" said Donatella Rovera, Amnesty International's senior crisis response adviser, who is currently in northern Iraq. ""The killings suggest a worrying pattern of reprisal attacks against Sunnis in retaliation for ISIS gains."" Meanwhile, witnesses said gunmen shot down an Iraqi military helicopter with an anti-aircraft weapon placed on a truck near Salaheddin University in Tikrit, about 160 kilometers (100 miles) north of Baghdad. The Iraqi Defense Ministry denied the helicopter was shot down. Prime Minister: We needed U.S. jets . The developments follow news that Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki told British broadcaster BBC that ISIS advances may have been avoided if Iraq had proper air cover in the form of fighter jets the country has been trying to secure from the United States for some time. ""I'll be frank and say that we were deluded when we signed the contract"" with the United States, al-Maliki told the BBC in an interview this week that was released early Friday. Iraq has now turned to Russia and Belarus to buy fighter jets, he said. ""God willing, within one week, this force will be effective and will destroy the terrorists' dens,"" he said. Iraqi Ambassador Lukman Faily told CNN's ""New Day"" that his nation appreciated the help it has received from Washington but now faces ""an immediate threat."" ""We don't have the luxury of waiting; we need the support now,"" Faily said. American and Arab diplomats tell CNN that the United States is unlikely to undertake any military strikes against ISIS and its allied fighters before a new government is formed in Iraq. But that is unlikely to happen quickly. Parliament resumes Tuesday, and al-Maliki's political party controls 90 seats, the largest block of seats in parliament after April's elections. To form a government requires a majority of at least 165 seats. Obama has promised Iraq the aid of 300 U.S. military personnel to advise and train Iraq's security forces after a near collapse in the face of the lightning ISIS advance in northern and western Iraq. But there have been no U.S. airstrikes, something that Iraq's military commanders have said is desperately needed. Claims of prisoner executions . At the same time, disturbing claims have surfaced, with detainees and relatives of those killed providing graphic accounts that suggest Iraqi forces killed Sunni detainees before withdrawing from Tal Afar and Mosul. Both cities are under the control of ISIS, and Iraqi security forces and Shiite militias have been battling ISIS and militant allies in Baquba. ""Even in the midst of war there are rules that must never be transgressed."" Rovera said. ""Killing prisoners is a war crime. The government must immediately order an impartial and independent investigation into the killings, and ensure that those responsible are brought to justice."" Abdul-Sittar al-Birqdar, spokesman for Iraq's Supreme Judicial Council that oversees the country's judicial system, said the government knew of the Amnesty International allegations but had yet to see any evidence. ""At this stage, this is all just media reporting,"" he told CNN on Friday. ""No witnesses have come forward, and no families have come forward with such claims. No one has officially asked for an investigation."" He called for the rights group to provide evidence, saying that ""we are still monitoring and checking, and we will keep checking,"" adding that ""under Iraqi law, we cannot move on it without claims and evidence."" Using satellite imagery and publicly available photographs purportedly released by ISIS, Human Rights Watch says it appeared that ISIS fighters in Tikrit executed three groups of men a short distance from former Iraqi leader Hussein's Water Palace on the banks of the Tigris River. ""The analysis suggests that ISIS killed between 160 and 190 men in at least two locations between June 11 and 14,"" the rights group said in its report. ""The number of victims may well be much higher, but the difficulty of locating bodies and accessing the area has prevented a full investigation."" From the photographs posted online by ISIS, it appeared the fighters killed the men at the site in at least three groups. ""The photographs show one group of men lying in one trench and a second group of men lying on top of the first. A third group of men is seen lying in a second trench,"" the group said. Human Rights Watch says the photographs show a third mass grave, but investigators have been unable to find it.

"Twenty years ago, a team of researchers shared the Web with the world. Now they want to show a generation that grew up online what it was like in its earliest days. The European Organization for Nuclear Research, known as CERN, is celebrating the 20th anniversary of the date it released, for free, the technology and software needed to run a Web server. In honor of the anniversary, a team has been assembled to recreate a working version of the first website, a how-to guide hosted by the project's creators. The organization issued a statement on April 30, 1993, that announced the release of that Web to the public. British physicist Tim Berners-Lee created and named the Web (also commonly called ""W3"" for short in those days) in 1989 at CERN. Originally, it was designed as a way for scientists at different universities and other institutes to share information. ""Vague, but exciting,"" Berners-Lee's supervisor wrote on the cover of a proposal while greenlighting the project. See a 1993 copy of the first website . By 1993, there were roughly 400 known Web servers. But the World Wide Web accounted for only about 1% of Internet traffic. The rest was remote access to computer networks, e-mail and file transfers from one computer to another. Since then it has, obviously, become a constant presence in the lives of people around the world. Today, there are somewhere around 630 million websites. ""There is no sector of society that has not been transformed by the invention, in a physics laboratory, of the Web,"" said Rolf Heuer, CERN's director-general.

"The fight against Ebola in Liberia got some welcome news -- with a little caution. The number of new cases in the nation appears to be declining, with fewer burials, plateauing lab confirmations and less-cramped hospitals, the World Health Organization said. If the trend continues, the hardest hit nation will get a much-needed break. The deadly virus has left at least 4,922 people dead mostly in  Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia. More than half of the deaths have been in Liberia, which has buckled under the weight of the epidemic, and even declared a shortage of body bags this month. Too soon to celebrate . Though health experts expressed optimism, they warned that the latest observation does not mean Ebola is under control in Liberia. The virus has the potential to appear in  waves, which can be mistaken for declining cases. ""The danger now is that we move, instead of a steady downward trend that gets us down to zero, that we end up with a oscillating pattern where the disease starts going up and down and areas start getting re-infected,"" said Dr. Bruce Aylward, an assistant director-general at the WHO. ""What gets the heat out of this thing and slows it down isn't necessarily what is going to get us to zero."" The numbers have been on the decline for about week, he said. Not declining in Sierra Leone . Despite the good news in Liberia,  Ebola infections have not slowed down in Sierra Leone, he said. One of the goals is to educate the population to help reduce contact between Ebola patients and those who are not infected. ""With the concerted community engagement, with safe burials, with a big push on getting the right information out through the right channels, you can rapidly get the behavior changes that are critical to protecting populations,"" Aylward said at a news conference in Geneva on Wednesday. ""And that can translate into positive trends in terms of the disease."" Scramble to develop vaccines . As the world reels from the outbreak, health experts are fast-tracking tests for various vaccines, and hope to have millions of experimental doses by next year. There is currently no cure or vaccine for Ebola, which has infected nearly 14,000 people mostly in the three most affected nations. Scientists racing to stop the epidemic are trying various experimental drugs on patients, including ZMapp and TKM-Ebola. In addition to drug development, there's a scramble to develop vaccines, with scores of companies working on experimental doses. Health care workers in affected nations will get the first opportunity to try the experimental vaccines.  At least 521 health workers have caught the virus worldwide. Of those, 272 have died. Ebola is spread by direct contact with the bodily fluids of an infected person. Complete coverage on Ebola .","Is Liberia getting a much-needed break?

"There was no shortage of wind or electricity at Thursday night's debate between Vice President Joe Biden and Rep. Paul Ryan, the Republican contender for that office. But federal support for wind power and electric cars was one of the early flashpoints between the two. ""Was it a good idea to spend taxpayer dollars on electric cars in Finland or windmills in China?"" Ryan asked Biden as he defended the Obama administration's economic stimulus measures. ""Was it a good idea to borrow this money from China and spend it on these interest groups?"" Ryan was criticizing the support for wind energy in the stimulus bill and to an Energy Department loan to electric automaker Fisker. It's not a new line of attack for the GOP or for Ryan's running mate, Mitt Romney. Both have been controversial and closely examined. Fact Check: Ryan cites unlikely outcome under Obamacare . The facts: . The Department of Energy agreed to lend Fisker nearly $530 million in 2009 to build two electric cars, the Karma and Nina, later dubbed the Atlantic. The plug-in hybrid Karma is being assembled in Finland, while the Atlantic -- which has yet to go into production -- was to be built at a former General Motors plant in Delaware. Fisker drew $193 million of the loan before May 2011, when it was cut off for failing to meet the Karma's production milestones. All of that money went to engineering and design costs, the Energy Department says. Fisker said ""not a single dollar"" was spent outside the United States. And while Ryan was attacking Biden over the Obama administration's 2009 stimulus bill, the loan actually came from an advanced auto technology program passed in 2007, before Obama took office. Meanwhile, administration efforts to promote the expansion of renewable energy, particularly solar and wind, have drawn fire from Republicans and some Democrats, such as New York Sen. Charles Schumer. Wind energy received about $9 billion in the stimulus bill, and Schumer complained to Energy Secretary Steven Chu in 2009 that a major project in Texas was being built with Chinese wind turbines. Industry analysts note that there were few U.S. firms in the business at the time. Of the top 10 turbine manufacturers in 2008, only one -- General Electric -- was a U.S.-based company, according to a 2011 Congressional Research Service report. The rest were in Europe, India and China. Russ Choma, an investigative journalist who documented the role of overseas corporations in the federal energy programs in 2010, said the plan was to start building equipment in the United States, and that has worked to some extent. ""The market needs the turbines from somewhere, so they had to go overseas with hopes that it would spur activity here,"" he told CNN in July. Fact Check: Iran and the bomb . The industry says generating capacity has doubled since 2008, and the Lawrence-Berkeley National Laboratory in California says that's created between 52,000 and 75,000 jobs. And while China's wind industry has grown rapidly with the aid of government support, it hasn't been a major player in the U.S. market. In 2010, nearly 60% of U.S. imports came from Denmark, the home of No. 1 turbine manufacturer Vestas; China and other Asian countries ""accounted for very small shares of U.S. imports, the CRS found. Conclusion: Yes, the Fisker Karma is being built in Finland -- but the government's support for Fisker was approved under a program signed by then-President George W. Bush, not through stimulus funds. And while international manufacturers did get a piece of American wind projects that were supported by the stimulus bill, that's largely because American companies weren't among the big players.

"(CNN) -- The official tally of last month's presidential election is almost complete, and one pivotal piece of electoral data -- voter turnout -- will be lower than officials have previously claimed. The turnout matters as it may reflect how much trust the Hondurans placed in an election during a political crisis pitting the country's de facto government against the nation's ousted president. According to Honduras' Supreme Electoral Tribunal and interviews with the electoral officials, with 99.8 percent of the votes counted, 2,298,080 people participated in the November 29 election. This represents a 50 percent voter turnout, a figure much lower than the 61 percent officially estimated by the electoral tribunal on election day, and lower than revised turnout figures that the Electoral Tribunal gave to CNN as recently as December 5. The crisis, which escalated after President Jose Manuel Zelaya was ousted in a coup last June, has split the international community now that a new president has been elected. Some countries, such as the United States, Colombia and Costa Rica, have said they will recognize President-elect Lobo Sosa. Others, such as Argentina, Brazil and Spain, have said they will not. Other nations have indicated that the turnout figure will be an important indicator in determining whether they will recognize the legitimacy of the election. To date, the tribunal, known as TSE by its Spanish acronym, has only released one official press release regarding the vote count. That statement, made on election day, cites a 61 percent voter turnout rate and says 2.8 million people cast votes. When CNN made its own analysis earlier this month, TSE spokesman Roberto Reyes Pineda said that about 2.6 million votes were cast. This downward revision turned out to be overly optimistic as well. ""There was clearly an effort to get out early vote results as robustly as possibly and convince the international community that the elections were legitimate,"" Christopher Sabatini, senior director of policy at the Americas Society and Council of the Americas, told CNN. But Reyes Pineda said that the electoral tribunal has not purposefully tried to put out inflated numbers. ""That was a projection that reflected the data at the moment,"" he said, referring to the data in the first press release and the data given to CNN. A consultant to the TSE who has participated on the official vote count disagreed. ""They gave out those numbers without any substantive evidence,"" said the consultant, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was fearful of jeopardizing his position. ""There was no substantive methodology behind their projections."" Estimates from TSE were higher than the patterns the statisticians were seeing because there was political pressure for the election to be considered legitimate and successful, the consultant said. Reyes Pineda said that the TSE's estimates of 2.8 million and 2.6 million votes cast were ""based on what we expected. The number could be a little erroneous, but it was based on the data at the time."" The electoral body hasn't put out any further updates to its original 61 percent voter turnout prediction to avoid confusion, he said. Another official press release is not expected until after all the votes are tabulated and all disputes in smaller races settled, Reyes Pineda said. A 50 percent turnout would mean that fewer voters participated than in the last presidential race, in 2005, where turnout was 55 percent, according to TSE data. But it also follows a trend of declining turnout since 1997. ""Even the adjusted numbers are not significantly different from the patterns of past elections,"" Sabatini said. A turnout of under 40 percent may have jeopardized the international acceptance of the election, but the actual turnout rate is still significant enough to be considered legitimate, he said. Other indicators that could shed light on whether Zelaya's calls for a boycott were heeded, such as the number of spoiled or blank ballots, are not significantly different than in the last election, TSE data shows.","Voter turnout numbers in Honduras lower than originally reported .

"Theirs were the faces that stood out in the chaotic helicopter evacuation off the Sinjar Mountains. Tears streamed down the cheeks of 15-year-old Aziza Hamid and her 17-year-old sister, Dunya, who were among a lucky few to fight their way onto an Iraqi helicopter, a scene captured this week by a CNN crew on the flight taking food and water to thousands trapped by extremist fighters. Two days later, CNN's Ivan Watson tracked the girls and some of their family members to the third floor of a derelict building in Zakho, Iraq, a makeshift shelter where roughly 1,000 Yazidis with nowhere to go have taken refuge. Inside, the girls, their brothers and their 16-month-old cousin are confined with their meager belongings to a few feet of bare concrete. ""You no have food. You no have drink. You no have sleep. It is very, very poor,"" the girls' brother, Kareem, told Watson on Wednesday. ""It's no good."" 'Heroic' mission rescues desperate Yazidis from ISIS . Their plight, like so many, began more than a week ago when they fled into the surrounding mountains when ISIS fighters stormed the town of Sinjar. Thousands are believed to be on the mountain, trapped without food, water or medical care in the summer heat. U.S. President Barack Obama ordered targeted airstrikes last week, partly to protect the Yazidis and others fleeing ISIS. He also ordered humanitarian airdrops. A mass evacuation of Yazidis is unlikely following an assessment by the U.S. State Department and military that found far fewer people were trapped than previously feared. Once believed to be in the tens of thousands, the number of Yazidis in the mountains is ""now in the low thousands,"" Brett McGurk, a deputy assistant secretary of state, told CNN on Wednesday. Part of the reason for the drop in the number trapped is the airstrikes and humanitarian airdrops, as well as Iraqi helicopter evacuations, McGurk said. For now, those escaping continue to do so either by helicopter or a treacherous journey on foot. Who are the Yazidis? ISIS fighters have vowed to kill the Yazidis, calling them ""devil worshipers."" Yazidis, one of the world's smallest and oldest religious minorities, are members of a pre-Islamic sect with its roots in Zoroastrianism. It has ties to Hinduism, Christianity, Judaism and Islam. When ISIS advanced on Sinjar, an ancestral home for many Yazidis, the Hamid family was forced to flee. ""I was happy we survived, but I was sad and worried about my father,"" Dunya told Watson. The girls' father, like so many, refused to leave their hometown of Sinjar ahead of the ISIS advance. ""We all tried hard to convince my dad but he refused to leave the house,"" the girls' other brother, Thabed Hamid, said. ""He said it would be a humiliation. I decided I couldn't let them capture girls and the women. So we left."" The family didn't make it far in their car before they ran into ISIS fighters, who were shooting at fleeing Yazidis on a bridge. Who are the religious and ethnic groups under threat from ISIS? ""I jumped out of the car and off the bridge,"" Aziza says, ""because I was scared of ISIS."" From there, they made their way up the mountain in the sweltering Iraqi summer heat. ""If we were able to find a tree where we could rest in the shade, we were lucky,"" Dunya said. ""For the first four days we had no food, only water. Any bread we found we fed to the little kids to keep them alive."" It would be days before they learned their father's fate. On Tuesday, they learned in a cellular telephone call their father was still alive. He escaped Sinjar and is on the mountain, the girls told Watson.","Far fewer Yazidis are trapped than previously feared, officials say .

"A 21-day quarantine for all military personnel serving in Ebola stricken areas of West Africa was approved by Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel Wednesday. The quarantine was pushed for by the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Hagel said. Initially the measure will apply to all personnel leaving the West Africa area. But Hagel said the policy will be reviewed within 45 days. The policy creates a separate set of rules for military members than what the White House has pushed for civilian health care workers. President Obama has argued that civilian volunteer health workers returning from aid trips to Africa should not be quarantined and the White House has urged states not to impose their own quarantine policies. Science, Obama has said, does not support the need for a quarantine. Related: Army major general speaks to CNN from inside quarantine . Asked to explain the discrepancy between civilians and the military, he said Tuesday service members have been sent to the Ebola region by him and health workers are going as volunteers. ""It's part of their mission that's been assigned to them by their commanders and ultimately by me, the commander-in-chief,"" the president told reporters on the White House's South Lawn on Tuesday.""So we don't expect to have similar rules for our military as we do for civilians,"" Obama said. ""They are already, by definition, if they're in the military under more circumscribed conditions."" The chiefs did not have new scientific or medical data about Ebola when they pressed for Hagel to approve the quarantine the military official said. ""This is simply about the chiefs looking at the best way to take care of the force, the families and the communities to which they are returning,"" a military official told CNN. This effort ""is an admittedly conservative approach,"" the official said. In their discussions the chiefs—who each head one of the military services branches—noted that many of the US troops are young and inexperienced in any medical issues. There was concern they might not adhere to an informal protocol of taking their temperature twice a day on their own. Hagel said Wednesday that the families and communities in the US and Europe where the troops are located had also expressed concern. ""They very much wanted a safety valve on this,"" Hagel said at an event in Washington. Rep. Mike Turner, a Republican from Ohio who serves on the House Armed Services Committee, said he was ""encouraged"" by the new policy. ""This act will ensure that our service men and women, their families, and our communities have the confidence that every necessary precaution is taken to ensure their health and safety."" The US already has 1,000 troops on the ground, and that force could grow to a total of 4,000. ""That's the biggest group of Americans there,"" the official said, noting that also was a factor in the chiefs thinking. ""The chiefs believe it is better to start more restrictive and then re-assess as we get further into the Ebola operation,"" the official said. For now, troops will be held in quarantine at bases designated by each of the military services. There will be provisions for compassionate leave—allowing troops to leave quarantine if they have a family emergency such as an illness or death. The quarantine will also not apply to those just briefly travelling to Liberia, or aircrews flying in an out, although everyone is told to monitor their temperatures. Related: New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie says he won't change Ebola policy . Army Chief of Staff Ray Odierno ordered an Army wide quarantine for soldiers coming back from West Africa, beginning with Major General Darryl Williams and his team. Defense officials had said the quarantine for Williams was ordered because he and his group had traveled extensively around Liberia, although they had no direct contact with Ebola patients.","Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel announced a new quarantine policy for troops returning from Africa .

"A Miami cruise ship terminal was evacuated for more than two hours Wednesday morning when customs officials detected radiation from a passenger bag. The radiation, they discovered, was being emitted from a Korean War-era compass. U.S. Customs and Border Protection spokesman Jaime Ruiz said officers from the agency detected radiation coming from a couple's bag as they disembarked from a cruise ship trip. Passengers in the terminal were evacuated, and other passengers were told to remain on the ship. The source of the radiation, Ruiz said, was discovered to be an old compass. After the compass was found to be safe, it was returned to the owner, he said. Customs and Border Protection officers wear radiation devices, similar in size to pagers, to detect possible threats. But the sensitive devices can also detect naturally occurring radiation in such substances as ceramics and kitty litter, and even in people recently treated with nuclear medicines. Ruiz said Miami-Dade Police Department explosives detection canine support and Miami-Dade Fire Rescue Department hazardous materials units responded to the scene.","Customs officials detected radiation from a couple's bag at a terminal Wednesday morning .

"Washington (CNN) -- The battle for control of Congress is entering a final, frantic five-day stretch that favors Republicans but has room for plenty of surprises that could determine which party will run the Senate. The unsettled nature of so many individual contests at this late stage underscores the unpredictability of this election season. And Election Night could turn out to be a nail-biter that continues for days -- or even months. The themes that were expected to dominate this election cycle -- Obamacare and immigration -- are turning out to be duds. Meanwhile, threats posed by Ebola and ISIS -- hardly dinner table conversations a year ago -- are suddenly top issues. And on top of all that, add a mix of 2016 presidential drama as potential contenders barnstorm early voting states to help congressional candidates. The GOP is poised to extend its grip on the House and needs a net gain of six seats to take back the Senate for the first time since 2007. Republicans are expected to easily take Democratic seats in Montana, South Dakota and West Virginia, leaving them needing just three more seats to build a Senate majority. But getting there could get tricky. North Carolina Democratic Sen. Kay Hagan is holding firm in a race many observers thought she would have lost by now, up four points in an Elon University survey over her challenger, Thom Tillis. In Georgia, Democrats believe that Michelle Nunn â€” one of the emerging stars of this election cycle â€” could beat Republican David Perdue. If neither candidate gets 50 percent of the vote a run-off election will take place in January. In Kansas, Senator Pat Roberts is still slugging it out against independent candidate Greg Orman and even the man most likely to become majority leader in a Republican Senate, Mitch McConnell, cannot take re-election for granted in Kentucky. The loss of any of that trio would complicate Republican hopes in the Senate. Still, there are other pickup opportunities for Republicans. In Colorado, Democratic Sen. Mark Udall seemed to be in good shape just a few months ago. But now he's down by seven points to Republican challenger Cory Gardner in a Thursday Quinnipiac University survey. The Denver Post had the race closer â€” with Gardner up two percent. In New Hampshire, Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen is in a very tight race with former Massachusetts Sen. Scott Brown. Meanwhile, Arkansas Democratic Sen. Mark Pryor, fighting an uphill battle in an increasingly red state, was down between 13 and seven points to challenger Tom Cotton in two recent surveys. Other key states where Republicans have a good chance of picking up seats include Louisiana, Alaska and Iowa. Though the 2014 race isn't even wrapped up yet, the next election in 2016 is already unfolding as potential presidential candidates stump in key early voting states. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie announced plans to blitz 19 states before Election Day, including Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina, which will play outsized roles in the presidential campaign. Jeb Bush, meanwhile, made waves by jabbing Hillary Clinton over her attitude towards business. On the Democratic side, Clinton, who increasingly appears to be waging an undeclared presidential campaign, tracked through Iowa this week -- the state that did most to doom her 2008 White House bid. Obama remained a sideshow, with his low approval rating making him unwanted by Democrats in swing states. So, he has been largely confined to raising millions of dollars for Democratic Party coffers, or stumping for candidates in liberal territory. On Thursday, Obama was headed to Portland, Maine, to campaign for Rep. Mike Michaud who is seeking to unseat Republican incumbent Paul LePage in a tight governor's race. CNN's Ashley Killough, Dan Merica and Jeremy Diamond contributed to this story .","The battle for the Senate is unsettled heading into the final days of campaigning .

"Afghanistan factored in Monday's third and final presidential debate, which covered foreign policy.  At one point, President Barack Obama accused Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney of initially being against a withdrawal of forces from Afghanistan in 2014. The claim: ""In the same way that you initially opposed a timetable in Afghanistan, now you're for it, although it depends,"" Obama said. Fact Check: Romney, Obama and Iraq . The facts: As early as last year, Mitt Romney said he agreed with a 2014 withdrawal date. ""The timetable by the end of 2014 is the right timetable for us to be completely withdrawn from Afghanistan, other than a small footprint of support forces,"" he said during a November 2011 Republican candidate debate. And during a recent address at a veterans convention, Romney reiterated his support for a 2014 withdrawal. ""As president, my goal in Afghanistan will be to complete a successful transition to Afghan security forces by the end of 2014,"" he said. Fact Check: Comparing costs of Iraq, Libya missions . But during that same speech Romney added a caveat, saying he would talk to commanders on the ground to evaluate the conditions in Afghanistan before the withdrawal. ""I will evaluate conditions on the ground and solicit the best advice of our military commanders,"" he said. This stipulation of seeking advice from commanders ahead of the withdrawal is where Obama and Romney differ. The Obama administration has repeatedly stated that a 2014 withdrawal is absolute. Most recently, Vice President Joe Biden said many times during his debate with Romney's running mate, Paul Ryan,  ""we are leaving in 2014."" The Obama administration does however plan to leave 10,000 to 15,000 troops in Afghanistan after 2014, should the Afghan government agree to it. During and interview with ABC in July, Romney again left the door open to moving back the 2014 deadline if commanders on the ground in Afghanistan told him that they needed U.S. troops to stay longer. Fact Check: Is al Qaeda's core decimated or growing? ""I don't want to go into hypotheticals, but we recognize the circumstances may change on the ground either for the better or for the worse. I don't think you set hard and fast deadlines without recognizing that there is the potential for conditions to change,"" he said. Romney's criticism has centered on Obama announcing the withdrawal date. ""Announcing a withdrawal date, that was wrong,"" Romney said during his announcement of entering the presidential race in June of 2011. ""The Taliban may not have watches, but they do have calendars."" Conclusion: . Mostly false. Romney agrees with a 2014 withdrawal deadline but has added the caveat that he would seek advice from commanders on the ground at that point, leaving the door open to possibly staying longer. What Romney has disagreed with was the announcement of the withdrawal deadline, not the deadline itself. Complete coverage of CNN's Fact Checks .","Third presidential debate covers foreign policy .

"Students aboard the stricken Sewol ferry had to use rising water levels to float out of their cabins after the ship listed, survivors told a South Korean court Monday. At least 294 people died -- including hundreds of high school students on a field trip -- when the Sewol capsized off South Korea's southwestern coast April 16. The ship had been carrying 476 passengers and crew, and divers are still searching for 10 people. The ferry's captain, Lee Joon-seok, is on trial, accused of murder, along with three of his crew. They deny the charges. Twelve other members of the crew have been indicted on charges of abandonment and violating a ship safety act. It has been alleged that the crew did not use available resources, such as life rafts, life vests and announcements, to evacuate passengers. Instead, passengers were told to stay where they were, according to officials. Six student survivors testified Monday at a court in their hometown of Ansan. Their identities cannot be published. The second student to testify said she heard an announcement asking those on board to put on life jackets and remain on the ferry. The student told the court that she did not hear any announcement from the ship or coast guards telling passengers to leave the ship. She said the ferry listed to the extent that the windows were on the ground and the door was on the ceiling in her cabin. As water came in, their class leader suggested that because they were in life jackets they could float to the door. They eventually were able to escape, walking on the hallway. The fifth student said that she considered trying to escape once the ferry began listing, but did not because she heard the announcement asking passengers to stay put. She said the lights then went out and she saw that the window was completely covered in water. She escaped when the water rose and she was able to float to the door. Students already in the hallway dragged her outside. Another student described the scene in the hallway as she lined up to exit. She said a strong current was in the water and about half the students with her were swept away. The student said she could see coast guards near the emergency exit, but she never saw them enter the ship. After the students' testimony, the court heard from another survivor, who was in a wheelchair and wearing a hospital gown. He described how he had managed to get himself near the information desk when the ferry had started to tilt. The man said the students had been panicking and a female crew member announced that ""everyone should stay put, the ferry is in danger, and that the rescue will be there soon."" He said he thought she was trying to calm the students. The man said that he had asked the crew member to contact the captain, but that the captain had not responded when she tried to reach him on a walkie-talkie . The female crew member announced again that everyone should stay put and that help would arrive soon, he said, and later told students to put on their life jackets . The man broke down crying as he described watching people slide as the boat tilted about 40 or 50 degrees. Tense trial opening in June . The students arrived at the Ansan courthouse under a heavy police presence Monday, with lines of officers surrounding the building. At the trial's opening June 10 in Gwangju, victims' relatives yelled and screamed at those on trial upon seeing them for the first time. Investigators have said a vast amount of cargo -- more than double the ferry's limit -- and the failure to tie it down properly were partly responsible for the Sewol's capsizing. At the trial's opening, the prosecution accused the ferry's owner, Chonghaejin Shipping Co., of putting profit above all else by overloading the Sewol. It said the cargo was badly secured, meaning the crew was also culpable. Prosecutors said the crew members could have carried out a far more effective rescue operation. In June, Lee's attorney told the court that the captain had been helming the ship for only six days, he was the last rescued of all the crew members and he wasn't in charge of loading cargo. If convicted of murder, Lee and his fellow accused could face the death penalty, although it has been nearly two decades since capital punishment was carried out in South Korea.

"Roger Federer has called on tennis to redouble its efforts in the fight against doping, saying it would be ""naive"" to think the sport is clear of drugs cheats. ""Naivety says that tennis is clean, the way it's been all the way through,"" the 17-time grand slam champion 31-year-old told CNN. ""It's pretty good, of course every sport always has some cases. But I think our sport needs to do the upmost to try to make sure the integrity stays and that the fans don't tune into different sports just because they don't trust the players anymore. ""I've always been fighting to make sure we have enough testing."" Several high-profile doping scandals have rocked sport in recent months. Lance Armstrong was stripped of his seven Tour de France titles before Australian sport was rocked by a government report which alleged many athletes were using illegal substances supplied by organized criminal groups. Football's global governing body FIFA intends to introduce biological passports to detect drugs cheat, while in Spain the Operation Puerta trial into the doping network of Dr. Eufemiano Fuentes continues. Federer suggested introducing a system similar to the one used in cycling, where an athletes drug test results are kept over a period of time so that the use of a banned substance is more easily detected. Novak Djokovic, currently the world's top-ranked male tennis player, told reporters at January's Australian Open that he had not been tested in the previous six months. Federer called for increased funding and testing to ensure transparency. ""More funding, more blood, more urine, you name it -- more funding all across the board,"" the world No. 2 said. ""Maybe keep samples as well for a long period of time so you can go back and punish those players. The people, or the players, need to be scared if they cheat. ""Of course some players do it by mistake, but unfortunately it falls into the same situation and you have to pay the price for it."" The 31-year-old now finds himself as the elder statesman of the men's game, with his two nearest rivals -- Djokovic and world No. 3 Andy Murray -- both six years his junior. Despite a legion of younger stars launching an assault on the top of the sport, including the returning Rafael Nadal, Federer is comforted to see his fellow 30-something David Ferrer alongside him in the top five. ""It's nice to see that even though the game has become so physical that the older guys are hanging in there,"" Federer said. ""I don't know why that is, but I guess my generation of players is really strong. I think at one point at the French Open we had 30-plus players over 30 years in the main draw, which is pretty incredible. ""And it's nice to see that players aren't being pushed out at 27 or 29 because of the physicality in tennis right now."" Federer has also adapted to life as a father, after his wife Mirka gave birth to twin girls in 2009, although his daughters are still too young to fully appreciate who their father is. ""They actually now know winning and losing a little bit,"" said Federer. ""They also understand the practice and the matches now. ""I'm happy I've been able to stay successful ever since I've had the kids, because a lot of the press felt that things weren't going to happen for me after that."" Despite them being just three years old, Federer admitted he has already tried to get his children playing tennis. ""We've tried to put them into lessons, just for their hand-eye coordination and all of that. I think it's important for kids to do all sports if they have an opportunity.,"" he said. ""I'm a big believer that it's a great lesson in life, so we try to give them opportunities because we can and I think tennis is a great thing, so we'll see if they pick it up."" Meanwhile, Federer's defense of the Dubai Open title ended in semifinal defeat Friday to Czech Tomas Berdych, the man who also upset him at last year's U.S. Open. Federer held two match points in the second set tiebreak but they both went begging as Berdych won a thrilling match 3-6 7-6 6-4 against the five-time champion. It set up a final with Serbian No.1 Novak  Djokovic, who beat Juan Martin del Potro of Argentina, 6-3 7-6 in the earlier last four clash. It stretched Australian Open champion Djokovic's unbeaten run to 17 games and he will start warm favorite for Saturday's final, particularly after the exit of World No.2 Federer. ""Pity to lose that one, but Tomas did well to  hang in there,"" said the Swiss maestro.","Roger Federer says it is ""naive"" to think tennis is clear of doping .

"House Speaker John Boehner warned President Barack Obama in person Friday that signing an executive order overhauling immigration laws would spoil their chances of cooperating on other issues in the future. Boehner, Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell and other congressional leaders met with Obama for a two-hour lunch at the White House, where Boehner repeated the warning he'd issued after Republicans seized control of both chambers in Tuesday's midterm elections. Sources said immigration reform was the focus of a 30-minute discussion during the lunch. ""The speaker warned that unilateral action by the president on executive amnesty will erase any chances of doing immigration reform and will also make it harder for Congress and the White House to work together successfully on other areas where there might otherwise be common ground,"" Boehner's office said of the lunch. He and other congressional leaders didn't talk to reporters as they left the White House. But the White House said in a readout of the lunch that Obama ""reiterated his commitment to taking action on immigration reform in light of the House's inability to pass a comprehensive bill."" David Axelrod tweets Obama: Get House to vote on immigration . Obama had already repeated his pledge to sign an executive order on immigration in the coming months during a news conference this week -- and Boehner and McConnell separately said doing so would ""poison the well"" and complicate the White House's chances of getting Congress on board with any of its other goals. Boehner's message came the same day that Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus said that Obama's ""nuclear threat"" of an executive order on immigration  would cause the GOP to back away from supporting the type of comprehensive reform that he'd said looked key to the party's survival just two years ago. Immigration activists hope they don't get burned by Obama . Priebus blasted Obama for politicizing the issue, saying he's caused Republicans to lose interest in advancing a measure that would hand undocumented workers a pathway to citizenship before first improving security on the U.S. border with Mexico. And he said Obama would be ""throwing a barrel of kerosene"" on already-inflamed tensions with congressional Republicans if he goes ahead with ""executive amnesty."" ""What I think [Obama has] done is unify the country and the electorate around one big principle, and that's that we need to secure the border,"" Priebus said at a breakfast hosted by the Christian Science Monitor. ""He has created a situation that I think may have not have existed before that episode that has galvanized the country [to] a place where I don't believe most people are interested in comprehensive immigration reform unless they are convinced that the border is secure,"" he said. ""And I think it's because of the president's haphazard political game that's created an environment that will not allow the legislation to move forward unless people can be convinced that that border is secure. And that's where we've come."" Opinion: Obama, GOP, get going on immigration reform . Priebus's stance was a departure from an RNC-commissioned ""autopsy report"" that came in the wake of Obama's re-election in 2012. That report called on Republicans to support comprehensive immigration reform legislation, warning that otherwise, the party could alienate the rapidly-growing Hispanic electorate. He said most Republicans agree that immigration reform ultimately must happen. ""However, what we've seen happen over the last several months is that the president has been using people as political pawns and lying to people when it comes to immigration reform,"" Priebus said.","House Speaker John Boehner warns President in person against an executive order .

"(CNN) -- The tragic death of Robin Williams has once again taught us a bitter lesson: Depression does not discriminate, cannot be bargained with and shows no mercy. Depression does not care how wonderful your life is or how many people you've touched. Williams seemed to have it all: He was adored by fans, loved by family and friends and had fame and fortune. But it didn't matter, because someone suffering severe depression cannot feel the joy and satisfaction that comes with even the best things in life. As a society, we need to hear these collective cries for help and take depression seriously as a public health issue. Robin Williams and the dark side of comedy . Williams is not the first and won't be the last celebrity to have struggled with depression or mental disorder. Jon Hamm, Winona Ryder, Owen Wilson and many others have all made the point that depression can hit anyone at any time for any reason. Kurt Cobain suffered from bipolar disorder before his suicide. L'Wren Scott was rumored to be depressed before she hung herself. The World Health Organization estimates 350 million people worldwide suffer from some form of depression. When mental illness affects your family . Depression is characterized by intense and prolonged sadness and/or anhedonia (loss of pleasure). Symptoms including low energy, loss of concentration, sleep and eating disturbance and feelings of guilt and worthlessness can accompany depression. It is not exclusively an adult disorder. It can begin in childhood or adolescence and last throughout life with possible relapses. Some people can suffer major depression, others mild. There's also bipolar disorder, which is characterized by manic episodes and depressive episodes. Opinion: Robin Williams and depression: We all wear a mask . Depression is one of the leading causes of loss of productivity and disability. It's devastating on relationships. Depressed individuals will often experience sadness and be unable to experience pleasure, making it difficult to feel or express love toward others. There is also evidence suggesting that depression may be linked to chronic diseases. The worse is that depression is one of the most consistent risk factors for suicide. So what can be done? The field is still evolving. In more severe or chronic cases, the combination of medication and psychotherapy has shown to be particularly potent. There are ways for treatment to be cost-effective. But there are barriers that need to be overcome to adequately address depression. First and foremost, the stigma of depression is making us sicker. From an early age, children describe each other as ""crazy"" or ""weird."" This can often result in teasing and bullying for children with mental health issues, and social distancing from adults. As a result, individuals struggling with depression will often feel worse as a result of this mistreatment and be less likely to seek care. Going public with depression . Eradicating the stigma of mental illness must be a public health priority. For years, groups such as the National Alliance for the Mentally Ill have fought to reduce stigma. Those on the front lines of working with people with mental illness should receive adequate education and support to manage bias. Integrating mental health screening in primary care settings is another important step, as the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force has determined that this improves outcomes. Furthermore, the Affordable Care Act of 2013 expanded upon the Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act of 2008, providing more possibility that mental health conditions will be covered at similar rates to physical health conditions. Opinion: Suicide doesn't set you free . As we break down barriers and improve understanding of depression, we will hopefully reduce the number of tragedies. We shouldn't have to lose some of our brightest lights like Robin Williams.","Robin Williams, who was battling severe depression, committed suicide .

"The federal government will close 173 air traffic control towers at small- and medium-size airports on April 7 because of forced spending cuts, the Federal Aviation Administration told tower operators Tuesday. It will close another 16 towers on September 30, the end of the fiscal year. Spenser Dickerson, head of the Contract Tower Association, told CNN that FAA officials gave him the news, capping off a five-day period in which the FAA first told contractors they would close scores of towers, then backtracked on the news. The FAA said it would consider removing individual towers from the list on a case-by-case basis, if the operators can explain why it is in the national interest to keep them open, Dickerson said. The news Tuesday, if anything, was worse than previously announced. Last Wednesday, the FAA said it would close 168 towers. Some Democrats oppose GOP plan for government funding . ""We're extremely discouraged and disappointed that the FAA is taking this action,"" Dickerson said. ""The rest of the FAA's budget is getting a 5% haircut; the contract towers are getting a 75% cut, because the FAA is cutting 189 of the 251 contract towers."" ""It's hard for us to see the fairness in the budget cuts. It seems the contract tower program is taking a high, disproportionate cut. We have serious concerns about the safety, efficiency and loss of jobs in almost 150 communities across the country,"" he said. The FAA did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The towers are part of the FAA's contract tower program, in which 251 towers are staffed with contractors instead of FAA employees. Though little-known, contract towers are widely used by the FAA to manage air traffic. Such towers handle approximately 28% of all control tower operations, although the towers being cut account for a little less than 6% of commercial airline operations. John Cozart, CEO of Robinson Aviation Inc., which staffs contract towers in the South and Southwestern U.S., said the decision was ""not unexpected."" Opinion: Spending cut. Now, GOP, where are the jobs? ""I didn't think they'd resolve it in favor of the contract tower program. I kind of expected that they would continue on their course,"" he said. Asked for his reaction, he said, ""You're asking a guy who's having to lay off a ton of people because of this."" Tower closures would not necessarily result in airport closures, because some aircraft can land without air traffic control help, and those that need controller help can communicate with more distant FAA facilities. But the contract tower closings will contribute to the workload at other FAA facilities, which simultaneously will be coping with controller furloughs. A 2011 report by the Department of Transportation's Office of Inspector General said contract towers cost on average $537,000 a year to operate, compared with $2 million for comparably busy FAA-staffed towers. The lower costs were chiefly from lower staffing and salary levels at contract towers, which had an average of six controllers, while FAA towers had 16.  And a typical contract controller near Tampa, Florida, received a base pay of $56,000 per year, compared with a base pay ranging from $63,000 to $85,000 a year for an FAA controller in Sarasota, Florida, the study said. Dickerson said contract towers are carrying the brunt of the cuts, despite having comparable safety records and being more cost efficient. But the forced spending cuts, known as the sequestration, are also affecting FAA staff. Most of the agency's 47,000 workers, including its 14,700 controllers, have been told to expect one or two furlough days every two-week pay period. And 49 FAA-staffed towers are on the list of those facing possible closure. Longer lines at airports due to budget cuts?","Spending cuts prompt tower closures at small and medium airports, agency tells operators .

"I am not an expert on Asperger's syndrome. But I am an expert on me, and I have Asperger's. And attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. And a bit of obsessive-compulsive disorder. Having all three disorders together is not unusual, my doctor says. Like you, I get angry sometimes. And, like you, I would never think of channeling that emotion into violence. There is no direct connection between violence and autism. None. I don't break things. I don't hit my dogs. I keep a small Tupperware container in the house to catch insects so I can transport them safely outside before my cats or wife see them. I don't disparage hunters, but I could never kill another creature. I just don't have it in me. Thoughts on Newtown shooting from a man with Asperger's . For the most part, I am just like you, just a bit quirky. All right, a lot quirky. I am pedantic. I usually have no expression on my face or in my speech. I cannot look you in the eye. (I've learned to look people in the mouth or nose.) I cannot have a conversation of more than a few words with you, but I can lecture you ad nauseam on U.S. atomic bomb tests, the Cleveland Browns, beagles, Japanese society. When you speak to me and I look away intently, I am parsing your words and running through scenarios based on your request or statement in an effort to understand you. Please bear with me. Because I still have a deathly fear of offending someone or talking about something way off-topic, I often hold my hand over my mouth in meetings to keep from speaking. Being called on to speak is sheer terror. And those are just some of my oddities. Your child/partner/co-worker with Asperger's has some similar peculiarities. That's why kids with Asperger's get bullied. I was lucky. I didn't get bullied in school because I wasn't diagnosed and therefore not labeled. I wasn't diagnosed until I was 50. And when the doctors asked what course of action I wanted, I said none. I had made it that far, so I'd like to continue working it out on my own. In fact, until today, most of my co-workers and friends didn't know I had Asperger's. So ""Aspies"" can grow up to have families and be productive and contributing members of society. I cannot say this will get you through life, and some of my advice may be wrong for you. But here's what helped me: . Find a ""mentor.""

Yes, I know you're uncoordinated, but you can teach yourself coordination. I spent years throwing a ball against the garage, developing a throwing motion, building the ability to catch a ball and, eventually, hitting that ball. By the fifth grade, I was playing third base in schoolyard pickup games -- and I was no longer picked last. My self-esteem skyrocketed, and the tough kids accepted me. Write. Take all those thoughts in your head and put them down on paper or a computer screen. Reread them a day, a week, a year later. Show them to someone you trust. I'll bet he or she thinks a lot of the same things. Accept your peculiarities and take advantage of those you can: the ability to focus, above-average intelligence. Live. Be brave; get out there a bit. Take your obsessive gardening hobby and use it to socialize by checking out a gardening club or volunteer to help spruce up the neighborhood. Learn a bit of self-control, but go ahead and make mistakes. Apologize and have a laugh. ""Neurotypical"" people can be quite forgiving, given the chance. Bullies are more socially flawed than you are. If you're a parent of a child with Asperger's, let your child experiment. That's how we all learn. He or she is likely quite intelligent.

"(CNN)Atletico Madrid stunned their city rivals Real after thrashing them 4-0 in what must count as one of the most humiliating derby defeats in recent memory. The Spanish champions took a first half lead after Real's goalkeeper Iker Casillas fumbled Tiago's shot into his own net. Although there was little Casillias could do about Saul Niguez's stunning overhead kick that gave Atletico a 2-0 halftime lead. The visitors had hoped to cement their strong position in this season's title battle with the return of Cristiano Ronaldo, who had been suspended for two matches following a sending off last month. But Atletico pushed on in the second half with goals from Antoine Griezmann and Mario Mandzukic sealing a historic derby day victory. Atletico are now unbeaten against Real in six matches. Angry Ancelotti . ""It is easy to analyze this game because Atletico were better in every facet of the game: they fought more, had more quality on the ball, had better organization, everything,"" Real Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti told AFP after the match, calling it  ""the worst game we have played since I have been coach."" ""We will reflect on it in the coming days with a cool head. We will suffer a lot from this defeat, but we need to change this attitude and avoid it happening in another game in the future,"" he added. ""We failed at everything, we lost all the tackles, all the high balls. We didn't have one player who played well."" Ronaldo unhappy . Equally as unhappy was Cristiano Ronaldo. His return from suspension did little to revive what was a limp and lifeless Real performance. ""Real Madrid cannot lose 4-0 against anyone,"" said Ronaldo. ""We lacked desire, attitude, everything. The team wasn't fresh mentally or physically, but there are no excuses. The damage is done."" Atletico coach Diego Simeone, meanwhile, was ecstatic at his team's performance. ""I always insist that the players are the most important people,"" he said. ""Today their capacity to understand what we needed and execute it was fantastic."" The victory has revived Atletico's flagging title aspirations. They sit in third, with Real's lead at the top cut to seven points.

"(CNN)FIFA president Sepp Blatter and the head of the Confederation of African Football Issa Hayatou have slammed the ""western media"" over their reporting of the crowd violence that marred Thursday's Africa Cup of Nations semifinal between Ghana and hosts Equatorial Guinea. Thursday's game saw home fans pelting Ghana's players and supporters with bottles, rocks, broken glass and cutlery after Equatorial Guinea conceded two quick first half goals. The game resumed in the second half but was halted after further violence directed at Ghana's supporters. According to eye witnesses the security situation was sufficiently dire that a helicopter was deployed to hover low over the stadium and scatter the rioting fans. There were reports of further riots in the streets around the stadium. Several Ghanaian supporters were also injured during the violence. One Ghanaian football official described the scene as being like a ""warzone."" Chaos . ""In front of me was utter chaos -- angry, screaming fans. But there were scared, scurrying fans, too,"" recalled Gary Al Smith, a Ghanaian football journalist who was in the stadium at the time. ""I've never played in front of anything like that and I'd like to say sorry on behalf of my team,"" said Equatorial Guinea's star  player Emilio Nsue after the match was restarted and his team had lost 3-0. ""It was an odd experience -- one I've never felt before."" Yet on the eve of the final, Blatter and Hayatou held a press conference where they blamed western journalists for making the violence sound worse than it was. ""When something bad happens in Europe, they say it's an error. When something happens in Africa, they begin talking about corruption,"" Hayatou said, before adding that he believed ""the western media are simply here to perpetuate colonization."" Blatter, who will fight a FIFA presidential election in May and is relying on African votes to secure another term of office, later seemed to endorse those remarks. ""The media can play a role, must play a role, but they must play a role where the notions of respect and fair play are the basics,"" Blatter said. ""Today the world opens the newspapers, watches television, and sees only murders and killing,"" he added. ""We never talk about princesses marrying any more."" Blatter went on to congratulate Equatorial Guinea's hosting of the tournament. The tiny oil rich nation, which has been severely criticized over its human rights record, stepped in at the last moment after Morocco pulled out citing fears about the spread of the Ebola virus. Equatorial Guinea had been fined close to $100,000 over the violence and ordered to pay the expenses of the 36 injured Ghanaian fans. Third place . Saturday saw another potential flashpoint pass without incident. The Democratic Republic of Congo beat Equatorial Guinea on penalties in the third place play off after the two teams played out a 0-0 draw. Before the game several players had suggested that the tie should be played behind closed doors with no supporters. One player, Democratic Republic of Congo defender Gabriel Zakuani, even suggested forfeiting the match altogether. ""If they're throwing this at players, Eq Guinea, you can have 3rd place,"" he tweeted after the incident, alongside a picture of some of the objects that had been thrown from the stands. ""I love football but prefer to live. #AFCON2015."" In the end the match took place under tight security with barely 500 supporters in the stadium. All eyes will now be on Sunday's showpiece final, which will again take place in Bata. Meanwhile, journalists covering the event have reacted incredulously to Hayatou and Blatter's remarks. .""Blatter's got me bang to rights,"" tweeted British football journalist Jonathan Wilson.

"(CNN)Tottenham's English goalscoring sensation Harry Kane carried on his superb form this season by scoring twice to beat Arsenal 2-1 in the north London derby. Kane, who was playing in his first derby match for his boyhood club, scored his 21st and 22nd goals of an incredible breakout season after Tottenham fell behind controversially in the first half. Coach Arsene Wenger had raised the possibility that key striker Alexis Sanchez might recover from a hamstring injury in time. Sanchez didn't make it but former Real Madrid star Mesut Ozil, himself only recently returned from injury, skillfully fired home after Olivier Giroud had fired the ball across the penalty box. Replays showed that Ozil was marginally offside. The setback didn't trouble Tottenham for long, who dominated for long periods as Arsenal conceded possession and played counter attacking football. Kane leveled the match after Arsenal goalkeeper David Ospina could only manage to parry a high ball in to the striker's path. His second, however, was unstoppable. Kane rose highest in the penalty box to cleverly steer the ball back across goal and into the top left hand corner. ""I'm enjoying it. I just want to be out on the pitch playing with my mates,"" said an emotional Kane, who had tears in eyes following a standing ovation as he left the pitch. ""I don't think I can put into words,"" he added. ""It's my first London derby. It's incredible."" The victory saw Mauricio Pochettino's team leapfrog Arsenal in to fourth place. Wenger, meanwhile, was unhappy with his team's performance but also had words of praise for Kane, who is the leading English goalscorer in the Premier League. ""If you don't give him a game quickly, somebody else will give him a passport,"" he said of calls for Kane to be called up to the England national team squad. Wenger on the 'Kane for England' bandwagon: ""Ifyou don't give him a game quickly, somebody else will give him a passport!"" Elsewhere on Saturday afternoon, champions Manchester City fell further behind Chelsea in the Premier League title race after being held 1-1 by relegation threatened Hull City. Hull took a shock lead at the Etihad Stadium, where Manchester City had been impenetrable until recently, when David Meyler fired home. The goal looked like it would secure Hull City a vital three points, until England international James Milner scored a late, late equalizer deep into injury time. Whilst Manchester City will no doubt be happy to have at least salvaged a point, they will be less happy to have seen Chelsea pull seven points clear at the top of the table. Chelsea coach Jose Mourinho had never been in charge of a winning side away from home against  Aston Villa. But an early Eden Hazard goal looked to have set Chelsea up for an easy victory. Aston Villa had only scored eleven times this season in the league yet managed to pull level through Jores Okore before Branislav Ivanovic restored Chelsea's advantage, as well as tightening Mourniho's grip on another Premier League title. In Saturday's late game Liverpool drew 0-0 with Everton in the Merseyside derby.","Tottenham beat Arsenal in the north London derby 2-1 .

"Beach volleyball players, particularly Olympians, are known all around the world for their incredible skill with the ball. They've also been known for wearing those skimpy uniforms. Now, something that's covering their skin is getting a lot of attention. It's called kinesio tape. The tape has been around for decades, but during the London 2012 Olympics, it has been spotted stretching and spiraling in interesting patterns on some athletes. U.S. silver medalist Trey Hardee had big black pieces snaking up his legs in the decathlon.  German beach volleyball star Katrin Holtwick wore bright blue bits of it running up and down her six-pack abs. Even ping-pong players were reportedly wearing it. With its Olympic popularity, athletic trainers say you can bet you will see a lot more of the tape at your local gym or on the playing field this year. Paul Ullucci Jr., a Rhode Island athletic trainer who is on the board of the National Athletic Trainers Association, says he received a call Friday from a patient about the tape. ""She said she had been watching the Olympics, saw the tape on sale, and wondered if she should buy it,"" he says. ""I definitely think I'll be getting a lot more of these calls for the next month or two."" The highs and lows of the 2012 Olympic 'crying games' Ullucci says he keeps the tape as a tool to help improve balance in athletes, and says it helps prevent excessive protraction injuries -- in layman's terms, shoulder problems from activities including playing tennis. If you put the soft and stretchy cotton tape in the right area, Ullucci says, it will pull at your skin when you start to overextend your arm, reminding you not to. Because the tape is thin and pliable, it's different from athletic tape used on ankles or wrists, he says. That kind of tape keeps the injured joint from bending to prevent further injury. Japanese chiropractor and acupuncturist Kenzo Kase designed the taping method in 1979, according to his company, Kinesio. He thought the standard taping methods of the time were too restrictive and may even extend injuries, because they inhibited the flow of inflammatory fluids beneath the skin. A flexible tape that could be applied to injured muscles, he believed, would stimulate circulation through its tug on skin and start clearing out the damage. According to Adam Halpern, education director for Kinesio, Kase's patients kept telling him they felt great in his office, but the impact of his healing hands would diminish after a while.  The tape he developed stretched the good feeling. ""I was just at the Olympic beach volleyball game between Russia and China with him, and both of the teams were covered in it,"" Halpern said. ""You should have seen the doctor's smile. To think he just had an idea and created a product that serves practitioners and is used at the highest level of athletic competition in the world, well, you know why he was smiling."" The company has trained more than 100,000 practitioners around the world on how to use the tape, Halpern says. It has been used by 80 countries at the London Games, he says. It also has been spotted at the usually staid Wimbledon and on athletes including soccer's David Beckham and cycling's Lance Armstrong. ""A lot of athletes like it because there are no chemicals and it is a natural healing mechanism that tells different receptors to deactivate a little bit if the muscle gets too tight,"" Halpern says. Some, however, are skeptical about the tape's effects. There aren't many large scientific studies regarding its effectiveness, says Dr. Nicholas Fletcher, an assistant professor of orthopedic surgery at Emory University. ""I think, if anything, there is a placebo effect involved, and there probably is a little bit of a peer pressure effect. When people see athletes who are doing so well, they think, 'Maybe this could work for me,'"" he says. Why do Olympians bite their medals? He compared the tape to knee braces for athletes. ""There is little data to support knee braces' effectiveness in a lot of situations, but when I talk to my patients, they say they don't want to run without it,"" he says. Robin Rogers, an Atlanta runner who is also a massage therapist for athletes, says he's a fan of the tape. ""It definitely feels like it is doing something, and helped me feel better in training,"" Rogers says. He has used it for his own plantar fasciitis. With his clients, he uses it for shin splints and he has taped up some hamstrings. Rogers says he hasn't used the tape in any races yet. ""But hey, I'm a runner -- we'll try anything that will give us that edge."" Running coach and marathoner Tina Klein says she tried the tape, but it didn't work for her. ""I have hamstring issues and I kept trying it, but the stuff just wouldn't stick to me,"" she says. ""Ultimately, I decided to go the regular therapy route instead, but I know some people swear by the stuff."" Still, says Fletcher, ""If it gives you a sense of stability and support, or gives you that psychological edge, why not? It's not going to harm them. It's pretty-colored cotton tape.""","Several Olympians are seen sporting kinesio tape .

"(CNN)Tiger Woods' season took a turn for the worse when he was forced to withdraw from the Farmers Insurance Open at Torrey Pines just 11 holes into his first round on Thursday. A 14-times major tournament winner, Woods pulled out of the San Diego event when back spasms became such a problem that playing partner Billy Horschel had to pick up his tee for him on several occasions. The struggling 39-year-old was making his second PGA start of 2015 and had been on two over par when forced out of the event. Last year, Woods underwent surgery on a pinched nerve. His first start, at the Waste Management Phoenix Open last week, saw him chalk up the worst score of his professional life in the 1,267th round of his career. Former world No.1 Woods -- now at 56 in the standings -- recorded an 11-over-par 82 at TPC Scottsdale in Arizona. That meant he missed the cut, finishing bottom of a field of 132 as his short game fell apart and he racked up six bogeys, two double bogeys, a triple bogey and two birdies. The PGA tour website quoted him as saying that a delay to the start of his round in San Diego, caused by foggy weather, had been behind the back problems that forced him out. ""My glutes are shutting off,"" explained Woods. ""Then they don't activate and then, hence, it [pain] goes into my lower back. ""I tried to activate my glutes as best I could, in between, but they never stayed activated. ""I had a good warm-up session [before the weather delay], but then we stood out here, I got cold and everything started deactivating again. ""It's frustrating that I just can't stay activated. That's just kind of the way it is."" Horschel said he had become aware of Woods' increasing discomfort as the round progressed, adding: ""If I didn't see it on 10, I saw it on 11. Then I asked him when I walked off the 12th tee: 'Back hurting you again?' He said: 'Spasms.'"" What happened in San Diego will inevitably raise questions about where Woods goes from here as one of the game's all-time greats battles for full fitness and form. Horschel expressed his sympathy, saying: ""It's unfortunate, because I consider him a friend and I want to see him get back to his level of play that we all know he can. ""If he can just stay healthy and be able to work on it, I think we would see the results."" In November, Woods -- who has not won a major since 2008 -- was in the spotlight for his angry response to a parody interview by veteran Golf Digest writer Dan Jenkins. The second golf course created by his design business is due to open at Bluejack National, Texas, later this year. In an exclusive interview, he told CNN: ""My goal is to design a limited number of distinct and memorable golf courses.""","Former world No.1 blames weather delays for discomfort .

"The finger-pointing began almost immediately -- and with good reason. A mere few inches of snow had shut down Atlanta, forcing children to spend the night at schools, stranding drivers on interstates and making the city a laughingstock to the country. Why did this happen? Who's to blame? And, more importantly, could this happen elsewhere? Perhaps. Unlike Boston and New York, with their long-established infrastructures and diverse mass transit systems, Atlanta resembles the new American city. It's not just a city but also a region; a metro area that claims its outlying suburbs as its own -- as do Orlando and Dallas and Charlotte. It spans 28 counties sprawled over an area the size of Massachusetts. On Tuesday, a rare weather phenomenon mixed with poor planning and an overdependence on cars conspired to create a perfect storm. What can other cities learn from Atlanta's debacle? Let's comb through the claims and realities: . Ugly remnants after storm clobbers Deep South . CLAIM: This fiasco could have been avoided if Atlanta had a mass transit system like Boston's or Chicago's . Both Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed and Georgia Gov. Nathan Deal put much of the blame on the fact that everyone -- government, businesses and schools -- all tried to go home at the same time, clogging highways for hours. ""I said immediately yesterday that releasing all of these folks was not the right way to go,"" Reed said Wednesday. ""If I had my druthers, we would have staggered the closures."" REALITY: Yes, it could have . But the problem highlights how Atlanta and cities like it depend almost exclusively on cars. Atlanta does have a commuter train system, but it doesn't serve the whole metro area. While the city has a workday population of 1 million, the metro area's population is 6 million. And when offices and schools let out Tuesday, the masses got into their cars to head to the suburbs. An expansive public transportation system would have undoubtedly alleviated some of the ensuing traffic stress. This week's debacle is also disturbing because if another catastrophe were to hit and roads were the only path out, Atlanta would be in the same situation again. While a recent poll shows that many in the metro Atlanta area support expanded mass transit, the city hasn't figured out a way to pay for it. A transportation tax proposal recently failed, with some saying it would have spent too much money on roads instead of light rail. Was Atlanta asleep at the wheel? CLAIM: Atlanta needs a city government more like New York's . Former Lt. Gen. Russel Honore, who coordinated relief efforts along the Gulf Coast after Hurricane Katrina, said things would have gone more smoothly this week if Atlanta's city government was more like New York's. ""They need to have in Atlanta the same type of government you have in New York City, where the mayor controls the city and everything around that city, and the mayor can make decisions on road closures; he has emergency powers as when schools close,"" he said. The schools and the government should have been closed Tuesday, he said. REALITY: The metro area has many leaders . Metro Atlanta comprises 140 cities and towns -- most of which have their own leaders making their own decisions. And even within the city of Atlanta, Reed doesn't call all the shots, like New York's mayor. Reed said he doesn't have the ultimate say on some issues. For example, Atlanta Public Schools was responsible for deciding when to send students home. And the state is responsible for clearing interstate freeways. But the mayor also said he would have done some things differently. ""We made a mistake by not staggering when people should leave, so I will take responsibility for that -- in lessons learned,"" Reed said Wednesday. ""If we had to do it again, we would have said, 'Schools, you go first, private sector, you go second, and government goes last.' And so I think that would have helped."" Snow-stranded children . CLAIM: This was an ""unexpected storm,"" and Atlanta didn't play it safe like New Orleans did . As thousands of Atlanta commuters sat motionless on interstates Tuesday night into Wednesday, Georgia's governor said the path of the storm caught officials off guard. ""We have been confronted with an unexpected storm that has hit the metropolitan Atlanta area,"" Deal told reporters late Tuesday night. He said as of 10 a.m. ET on Tuesday, ""it was still, in most of the forecasts, anticipated that the city of Atlanta would only have a mild dusting or a very small accumulation, if any, and that the majority of the effects of the storm would be south of here. Preparations were made for those predictions."" REALITY: No it wasn't, and Atlanta should have . The National Weather Service put the entire Atlanta metro area under a winter storm warning at 3:38 a.m. Tuesday. The agency warned of 1 to 2 inches of snow accumulation and said it would begin ""as early as mid-morning and last into tonight."" CNN meteorologist Chad Myers said Atlanta had plenty of warning. Myers himself had predicted that up to 2 inches of snow would fall. In reality, just over 2 inches of snow landed in Atlanta. While that's nothing for most Northern cities, it can be a huge burden for Southern cities not accustomed to it. Contrast Atlanta's response to New Orleans'. It, too, was hit with snow and ice this week, but it decided to play it safe by closing certain roads. To be sure, New Orleans responded slowly to the disastrous Hurricane Katrina. But it's learned to heed warnings. Georgia's governor said he's also learned from this week. ""We all have some lessons we need to learn here from this,"" Deal said. ""And I think we all will."" Opinion: Stranded in Atlanta . CLAIM: Atlanta didn't pre-treat roads the way Buffalo (and many other Northern cities) do . It was a common refrain from drivers who sat more than 10 hours on Atlanta roads: Where are the salting trucks? Ashley McCants spent half a day in her car before she gave up, got out and carried her son 2 miles to a stranger's house, where they spent the night. During those 12 hours, she didn't see a single salting truck or snowplow. ""It was disheartening,"" McCants said. ""I felt like everyone knew this was coming."" She said the amount of snow ""was not that horrible."" But ""Atlanta was not prepared for it."" REALITY: Atlanta isn't entirely responsible, and the city doesn't have the capacity . While many pointed their fingers at the mayor, Atlanta's only responsible for surface streets in the city. It's actually the state that's responsible for maintaining interstates, where much of the gridlock occurred. The Georgia Department of Transportation commissioner said crews had been deployed farther south, but then scrambled closer to Atlanta as the storm got under way. But the traffic already choking the roads also blocked salt and sand trucks and snowplows. Myers, who is originally from Buffalo, New York, said streets there are salted well in advance of a coming storm. But Atlanta doesn't have the capacity for that kind of treatment. ""We simply have never purchased the amount of equipment necessary,"" he said. ""Why would you in a city that gets one snow event every three years? Why would you buy 500 snowplows and salt trucks and have them sit around for 1,000 days, waiting for the next event?"" Stranded drivers tell their stories .","Atlanta doesn't have a diverse transit system .
The city's mayor doesn't call all the shots .
The state, not the city, is responsible for treating interstate roads .
The governor said he was caught off guard by the storm's path ."
"English celebrity publicist Max Clifford was sentenced in a London court Friday to eight years in prison for a series of indecent assaults on teenage girls, Britain's Press Association reported. The sentence came four days after Clifford, 71, was convicted in connection with Operation Yewtree, an investigation set up after numerous allegations  against late British TV presenter Jimmy Savile and others. Clifford was part of the investigation that focused on accusations not directly connected to Savile. Clifford was convicted Monday of eight indecent assaults against young victims -- one as young as 15 -- and cleared of two charges. A jury could not reach a verdict on one other. He denied all 11 claims of sex abuse between 1966 and 1985, calling his arrest and prosecution ""a nightmare"" and declaring his innocence. Clifford was arrested in December 2012 and charged in April 2013 with suspicion of sex offenses after a TV documentary that aired in October 2012. In the documentary, which came out a year after Savile died at age 84, several people came forward alleging Savile abused them. That unleashed a flood of further allegations against Savile, who before that was seen primarily as an eccentric but charismatic man who raised millions of pounds for charity. Clifford is Britain's most famous celebrity PR consultant, renowned for his decades-long expertise in ""kiss-and-tell"" clients connected to English Premier League footballers and the world of pop and showbiz. Clifford also has represented several controversial celebrities, including O.J. Simpson, Frank Sinatra and Simon Cowell.","Max Clifford is found guilty of indecent assaults on teenage girls .

"The same elite Navy SEAL unit that killed Osama bin Laden took part in a daring nighttime rescue in Somalia of two American and Danish foreign aid workers, a U.S. official said Wednesday. The personnel attached to Naval Special Warfare Development Group, also known as DEVGRU, were part of the joint Special Operations force that rescued the hostages, CNN has confirmed. DEVGRU, formally known as SEAL Team Six, is one of several units that make up the storied fighting force. The SEALs parachuted into Somalia on Tuesday from fixed-wing aircraft and advanced by foot to the compound where the hostages were held, U.S. officials said. Nine gunmen were killed in the strike, the U.S. military said. There were conflicting reports of the number of wounded. The SEALs and the freed hostages left the compound on helicopters, said a U.S. official not authorized to speak to the media and who asked not to be named. The hostages, Jessica Buchanan and Poul Thisted, were abducted in October after they visited humanitarian projects in the northern part of Somalia, according to a Danish Refugee Council who employed them. Buchanan and Thisted were unharmed, the aid group said. ""It just takes your breath away, their capacity and their bravery and their incredible timing,"" Vice President Joe Biden said Wednesday morning, referring to the unit's capabilities. The Navy SEALs evolved from several specialized Navy commando teams that came into being during World War II when the United States realized that to invade enemy-held territory in North Africa, Europe and the Pacific, it needed savvy, quick-thinking fighters who could perform reconnaissance at sea. Beyond tactical expertise, the SEALs -- short for Sea, Air and Land teams -- needed to have extraordinary physical strength. The force became known for their jack-of-all-trade skills, able to survey China's Yangtze River disguised as Chinese nationals in 1945 or conduct demolition raids on railroad tunnels and bridges along the Korean coast during the Korean War. The SEAL moniker came after President John F. Kennedy spoke about his admiration for special forces troops and his hope that the U.S. military would better enhance its ability to engage in unconventional warfare, countering guerrilla and clandestine operations. There was a new and pressing need for more advanced military techniques during the time. Among other missions, the SEALs were deployed to act as advisers and train South Vietnamese commandos. U.S. special forces rescue Somalia aid workers . Vietnam was the first American war to be broadcast widely on television and other media, and woven into popular culture for mainstream consumption. It solidified the image of the SEAL as the ultimate tough guy, a reputation burnished by reports of SEALs' ability to do face-to-face combat with Vietcong and stories of their work with the CIA. The relationship between America's spy agency and its elite troops was crucial to gaining real-time intelligence for missions sometimes carried out at the last minute -- perhaps an asset more important now than ever, experts have said. The war against al Qaeda is just as much about obtaining reliable intelligence as it is winning on the battlefield. SEAL victories have been many. During the Vietnam War, they performed a covert operation called the Phoenix Program which captured Vietcong sympathizers. In the Iran-Iraq war, SEAL teams conducted missions to counter Iranian mine-laying boats. The first military flag officer to set foot in Afghanistan after September 11, 2001, was a SEAL in charge of all special operations for Central Command, according to the SEALs history page on its web site. The site says SEALs commanded Task Force K-BAR, which oversaw the Navy, Air Force and Coalition Special Operations Forces at the beginning of Operation Enduring Freedom. They carried out more than 75 special reconnaissance and direct action missions, destroyed more than 500,000 pounds of explosives and weapons, identified enemy personnel and conducted operations that searched for terrorists trying to flee the country by sea. The largest deployment of SEALs in the group's history came during the Iraq War, with SEALs directing missions that included securing all of the southern oil infrastructures of the Al-Faw peninsula and the offshore gas and oil terminals, clearing critical waterways so that aid could flow into the country. Several high-value terrorist targets were captured by the SEALs, including Ahmed Hashim Abed, the alleged mastermind of the murder and mutilation of four Blackwater guards in Fallujah in 2004. Another high-profile mission came in 2009 when a SEAL team rescued the American captain of the cargo ship Maersk Alabama, which had been hijacked by Somali pirates off Somalia's coast. SEAL snipers were on the deck of a ship and fired simultaneously three times, hitting three pirates who were holding the captain. Of course, the killing of bin Laden during the 2011 Abbottabad, Pakistan, raid was a golden moment for the SEALs. But not long after that victory, the SEALs suffered the loss of 17 members when their helicopter was shot down in Wardak province in Afghanistan during a mission intended to take out a known Taliban leader directly responsible for attacks against American troops, two U.S. military officials told CNN shortly after the August incident. The forces were called in to assist another unit on the ground pinned down in a firefight. In total, 38 people died in the incident. SEAL training is ""the ultimate test for a guy,"" said Chris Heben, a former SEAL with 10 years of experience carrying out missions in Africa, the Middle East and Afghanistan. It pushes a soldier mentally, physical and psychologically, testing how well they can work with others given intense pressure and pain. SEALs train between 18 and 24 months, with the pinnacle of training coming during Hell Week, five days in which trainees are constantly cold, hungry, sleep deprived and wet. Instructors deprive the participants of sleep, then let them hit the rack just long enough for REM sleep to begin, said Brandon Tyler Webb, a former SEAL who ran the sniper program at the Navy Special Warfare Command and was part of combat missions in Iraq and Afghanistan. Instructors are constantly yelling, ""Go ahead, quit if you like!"" Many do. The attrition rate for SEAL training is about 90%, Heben and Webb said. Most recruits drop out long before Hell Week because they can't take the training, which involves running 15 miles, topped with a 2-mile open water swim and other intense physical conditioning, Webb said. ""Every day is like climbing Mount Everest,"" Heben said. ""You just keep doing what's in front of you. You don't look up."" Training instructors make you feel like ""you're part of an Indian tribe,"" Heben said. ""There's a lot of back patting and verbal reinforcement. You feel like you're part of something, and you're doing great things. But they definitely let you know when you're not doing something right."" The discipline from SEAL training was intensely satisfying to Heben in his early 20s. He had gone to college, and though he was very bright he was spending more time working out than on his classwork. He was restless. Four walls and books just weren't his thing. Despite unimpressive grades, at 23 he got a job working in home mortgages making $63,000 a year. Then one day he read an article about the SEALs in Popular Mechanics. ""I enlisted in the Navy immediately,"" Heben said. ""I asked the recruiter, 'What is the fastest track to becoming a SEAL? I'll take that.'"" Though he won't discuss specific areas of countries where he's carried out missions, he said that he normally trained for missions on exact mock-ups of a targeted location.","Same SEAL unit involved in Osama bin Laden raid did Somalia rescue .

"Ever since disgruntled Americans declared themselves the 99% and occupied Wall Street, their protests have been compared to those in the squares of the Middle East and North Africa -- especially Cairo's Tahrir Square — where pro-democracy demonstrations challenged decades of tyrannical power. The movements in New York and Cairo share some characteristics, but direct comparisons between them discredit Arabs' tremendous struggles and sacrifices and squeeze the Occupy movement into a framework that does not fit. I had the fortunate opportunity to cover Egypt's mass protests in Tahrir Square and New Yorkers' takeover of Zuccotti Park and can say confidently that the two movements differ in many ways. It is true that New York City's Zuccotti Park -- like Tahrir Square -- has been enclosed by barricades and surrounded by police. Like the Egyptians, New York's protesters are determined to push forward their demands, especially through the use of social media. They're staying put 24 hours a day, defying the orders of authorities; they're creating medical and media corners, arts projects and musical performances and debating strategies. Some Egyptian activists have even advised protesters on Wall Street. However, Occupy Wall Street is no Tahrir Square. In Egypt, demands were clear: President Hosni Mubarak had to go.  Even after the 30-year president stepped down, demands remained focused on the regime. Protesters called for Mubarak and high-ranking officials to be held accountable, for a new constitution written by the people, for the military to hand over power to a civilian rule and for free and fair elections. The Occupy movement has clear frustrations with corporate greed, unregulated banks and the housing crisis. Protesters are disappointed in President Obama and his administration for bailing out the banks and ""not the people."" They have dozens of other grievances and continue to debate strategy and priority.  But these demands do not call for clear solutions. Unlike Egypt, where removing a decades-long presidency was a major success, in the United States, there aren't any high-profile figures to remove that will satisfy the protesters, not even temporarily. Not one Occupy Wall Street protester is risking his or her life to publicly proclaim their demands. In New York, police resorted to pepper spray and clubbings; in Oakland, California, police sprayed tear gas and are seen in videos apparently throwing stun grenades. Protesters display serious wounds they say were inflicted by rubber bullets. But even that excessive force cannot compare to the threat demonstrators in the Middle East and North Africa faced for displaying their dissatisfaction. Under the guise of emergency law, Egyptian police were given legal backing to crush peaceful protests. During the first 18 days of the Egyptian revolution, police and other state security organizations killed at least 840 people and injured thousands, according to Amnesty International. Protesters knew that they could die demanding democracy. It was a sacrifice they were willing to make, one that Americans have not had to consider. In stark contrast, protesters in New York consider rank-and-file police officers to be members of the 99%. In Egypt, the police forces were following direct orders from the leaders who were seen as the enemy.  New York's protesters cannot make that same link between N.Y.P.D. officers and the banks' billionaire CEOs. At times, protesters have marched to local Bank of America and Chase branches, but even then, they are not directing their frustrations toward bank employees, who they also see as members of the ""bottom 99."" Blaming the banks is rather new in the U.S., while in Egypt; dissatisfaction with Mubarak and the previous presidents has always existed. Many Americans have been hurt by the economy. Unemployment and homelessness remains high, and more than 1 million people lost their homes in 2010. This has created poverty in the United States, but nothing like Egypt's. Roughly 40% of all Egyptians live on less than $2 a day and have lived this way for a long time. The Egyptians' sense of having nothing to lose in the fight for change far eclipses that feeling in the U.S. The anti-bank movements have spread, but unless more Americans believe they too have nothing to lose, the protests can lose steam and fail at convincing the majority of Americans that the movement represents them. Winter months are approaching. Snow, winds and below-freezing temperatures will not skip Liberty Square. The will of the protesters will be tested in a way Arab revolutions hadn't dealt with. America's protesters found inspiration from Arab uprisings, but their needs and desires are distinct from those striving for change half a world away. Occupy Wall Street will grow and succeed on its own merits.","Ehab Zahriyeh: Occupy likened to Egypt, but this overlooks Arabs' extreme sacrifices .

"CNN.com assignment producer Michael Ryan recently opened up about his Asperger's syndrome, saying, ""For the most part, I am just like you, just a bit quirky. All right, a lot quirky."" Like Ryan, CNN's readers are worried about the unsubstantiated connection being made between autism and violence in the wake of the Connecticut school shooting. They posted more than 700 comments in support of Ryan and their loved ones with Asperger's. Here are some of the most popular comments. Some have been edited for clarity and space. Zena Kitty: My son had no friends. No one stood up for him. Children and adults alike were very cruel to him and would even take a step or two backwards when they first met him, as if they could catch Asperger's from him. They shunned him, refused to allow him to participate in social groups, and taunted him mercilessly. In the end, he killed himself. I miss my son. He was my hero and my best friend. Luis Hernandez: To this day these conditions (Aspergers, autism, OCD, depression, Tourette syndrome, etc.) are not understood. The social problems continue to this day and our children are at the mercy of cruel, ignorant children and adults who have little empathy for anyone who is ""different."" Nothing has changed. David Scott: I, too, have a son with a disability. He has cerebral palsy. Most people try to pretend he isn't really in the room. He is bright and fully understands his situation and what is going on around him, but nobody treats him that way in public. They stare, smile at us and keep walking by. Even friends don't know how to talk to him. It's up to us to teach them that he is capable of a relationship and wants to be normal. James Butler: One of my best friends has Asperger's, and he is one of the most marvelous and amazing human beings that ever set foot on this earth. Sheryll Thomson: I'm not happy with the word ""disorder."" ... Psychiatrists come from the medical profession and, thus, tend to look through ""medical model"" eyes. Meaning that they look for pathology, not for the strengths, creativity, quirkiness, as delight parts of the character. Disorder sounds like something that is needed to be solved, ordered, healed or recovered from. I think of it as a style -- more, a set of traps and talents which one can learn from. Always Hesed: This will be my fourth Christmas without my son. He too had his issues. ... He took his own life at school in front of a couple hundred students. I have a daughter as well who is now diagnosed bipolar, and two other children with Asperger's symptoms. It can be exhausting dealing with all the social fallout and rejection they have all experienced. ... If it wasn't for my faith in Jesus Christ, I can honestly say that I would probably not be here. Rebecca Batchelor: Autistic people are also more likely to be the victim of bullying and violence, rather than be the perpetrators of it. Parsons_project: I, too, have Asperger's. ... I think that the main thing people need to understand is that Asperger's/autism is not a mental disorder. It does not mean that we cannot process thoughts or understand consequences. Truth is, we generally overanalyze thoughts and consequences. Carla Hurst-Chandler: My Aspie son, now an adult, and I were discussing the multitude of new Aspie diagnoses -- seemingly more each year -- and he stopped for a minute and pondered, ""Did you ever think that what they are calling Asperger's is really just a new stage of human evolution -- the enhancements?"" The ability to focus so intently and learn. It is worth a thought. SMFDS: Like you, I learned about my Asperger's as an adult. Like you, I learned how to behave through mimicking others, and like you, I still have challenges but (am) finding my own way. And I have encouraged my children to do the same. Stoshu Grandstaff: As someone with Asperger's myself, the idea that we use it as a cop-out is disturbing. Often Asperger's means we put more work into a single few words then most people do during an entire conversation. Tuckerfan: My youngest has Asperger's; he's in his 20s now and blooming. Like the author he has turned his ""quirks"" into advantages. In his case he is a phenomenal cook -- because he is so focused that he turns out phenomenal and artful plates, every time.

"(CNN) -- Pop star Madonna suffered minor injuries Saturday when she was thrown off a horse after it was startled by photographers, her record label said. Madonna is due to begin a European tour on July 4. The photographers jumped out of the bushes to snap pictures of the 50-year-old singer while she was visiting friends in Bridgehampton, New York, said Liz Rosenberg of Warner Brothers Records. She suffered minor injuries and bruises and doctors will continue to monitor her, Rosenberg said in a statement. In 2005, Madonna broke three ribs, a hand and a collarbone after she slipped from a saddle during her 47th birthday celebrations.

"On December 12 a bride and groom traveled to their wedding in al-Baitha province, Yemen. It was supposed to be a day of celebration. Instead, in a few seconds, their happiness was obliterated. A U.S. drone fired at the wedding procession, destroying five vehicles and killing most of their occupants. Not even the bride's car, beautifully decorated with flowers, was spared from the carnage. Senior Yemeni officials later admitted that the strike was a ""mistake"". Quite some mistake: although the bride survived, the strike killed 14 civilians and injured 22 more, according to officials -- the largest death toll by a drone attack in Yemen since the program began in 2002. Since the killings, a wave of outrage has swept across the country. The Yemeni government rushed to meet community elders, seeking to negotiate a quiet settlement for the killing of the bride's loved ones. But the bereaved villagers rejected the overtures and instead demanded that President Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi stop U.S. drone strikes before they would sit at any negotiating table. As ever, the White House responded to press queries about the incident with only silence. U.S. President Barack Obama has issued no admission of responsibility, let alone an apology. Only after recent evidence gathered from the scene by Reprieve did officials grudgingly admit that they would look into the strike. This is not the first time a U.S. drone has killed civilians in al-Baitha province. On September 2, 2012, a U.S. drone hit a minibus near Radda, according to Yemeni officials. This time the vehicle was full of villagers carrying their day's shopping. As usual the initial press coverage labelled the dead as ""al Qaeda militants,"" but when the relatives threatened to deliver the bodies to the President's gates, the Yemeni government was forced to concede that all 12 people killed were civilians. Among the victims were a pregnant woman and three children. Only recently, we had reason to hope for better. Last month, Yemeni civil engineer Faisal bin Ali Jaber went to Washington, traveling over 7,000 miles in search of answers. He met Congressmen, Senators, and even some White House officials to describe how U.S. drone strikes incinerated his nephew and brother-in-law at his son's hometown wedding last year. In this strike two of the casualties were not only civilians, they were potential allies -- one was an imam who regularly preached against al Qaeda; the other was this small town's only policemen. Faisal received heartfelt condolences from many lawmakers. Yet no official was prepared to explain why his relatives were killed, or why the U.S. administration refused to acknowledge it had made a mistake. The use of drones in Yemen might seem a simple, quick-fix option for Obama. But with every civilian death, al Qaeda's recruiting power increases. Nabeel Khoury, former U.S. Deputy Chief of Mission to Yemen, recently reminded us of just that. Asked whether the covert U.S. drone war in Yemen was creating more enemies than it removed, he concluded: ""Drone strikes take out a few bad guys to be sure, but they also kill a large number of innocent civilians. Given Yemen's tribal structure, the U.S. generates roughly forty to sixty new enemies for every AQAP operative killed by drones."" Let me be clear: I, like the vast majority of my countrymen, reject terrorism. All of us were repulsed by footage of the gruesome al Qaeda attack on a Defence Ministry hospital that left dozens dead in December.  We agree that our fight against extremist groups cannot be won without a variety of efforts, including robust law enforcement. But U.S. drone strikes are exacerbating our problem by leaving families bereaved and entire villages terrified. Drones destroy the fabric of Yemeni society. Wronged and angry men are just the sort extreme groups like al Qaeda in the Arab Peninsula  find easiest to recruit. Our President may reassure the U.S. of his support for drone strikes, but he does so in complete contradiction to the Yemeni people's wishes. This year, two of Yemen's greatest democratic institutions made this clear. Yemen's National Dialogue Conference -- praised by Obama as a ""historic"" institution -- and the Yemeni Parliament have both voted overwhelmingly to ban the use of drones. For a country so often divided, this unanimity from Yemen's key democratic bodies shows the strength of public opinion against drones. But the people's cries have been met only with more missiles raining down from the skies above. How can we in Yemen build our fledgling democracy when our collective will is ignored by Western democracy's most powerful proponent?","In December a U.S. drone strike mistakenly targeted a wedding convoy in Yemen .

"It's a big nation that can take a long hard look at itself and reach the conclusion it might be a bit rude toward tourists. France, which regularly tops lists of countries that are surly to travelers, appears to be waking up to the notion this might not actually be good for business. While not exactly prompting a full-blown existential crisis, the admission does seem to have led to discussions on how to make its boulevards and brasseries more inviting. ""We must rediscover the meaning of hospitality,"" Innovation Minister Fleur Pellerin told a tourism conference last week. ""Everyone recognizes we can do better on the welcome and quality of service."" This won't be news to anyone who's visited Paris in recent years and received Gallic shrugs of indifference from waiters or hoteliers. Neither is it the first time that France has done some soul searching about its attitudes. Targeted by pickpockets . Last year Parisian tourism and trade officials launched a manual offering advice to service industry employees on how to befriend the various nationalities that flock to the city. Problems apparently persist -- not helped by a 2013 crime wave in which crowds of Chinese tourists were reportedly targeted by pickpockets. A six-day strike by French air traffic controllers that's expected to create major delays for travelers this week is also unlikely to burnish the nation's image. Pellerin said France mustn't ""rest on its laurels"" at a time when the country badly needs the annual $16 billion injection that tourism provides to its economy. Her comments came as Laurent Fabius, France's foreign minister, said in an interview that he wants to push through new measures to attract visitors. He told BFMTV that he was involved with discussions to ease France's restrictive Sunday trading laws to open up more shops in Paris. Fabius said he hopes improved road and rail links between the capital and Charles de Gaulle Airport will also improve matters. As might a drive to encourage more tourism industry workers to learn other languages. Shifting attitudes . Fabius said it's ""essential"" that people understand that any tourist ""whether French or foreign -- is someone we should welcome."" Some, however, say that France is at least making progress. ""I think that, on the whole, French attitudes have shifted and that French people are more courteous with tourists than they used to be,"" French commentator and journalist Agnes Poirier told CNN. ""They are also more likely to be able to speak English and give indications. ""It is difficult for Parisians to simply ignore tourists. They know tourists spend a lot, and are a vital element of the country's prosperity, and should therefore be well treated.""","French ministers say their country could try harder to welcome visitors .

"It was, the premature obituaries proclaimed, the beginning of the end for Serena Williams. The indomitable figurehead of women's tennis had been humiliated and cowed -- turfed out of the 2012 French Open in the first round by an unheralded and unseeded opponent. After an injury-blighted few seasons that saw her sink to 175 in the world rankings, Williams had hit one of the biggest troughs in her career. Given all she had achieved, it would have been easy to throw in the towel -- but even at her lowest ebb, Serena's desire to clamber back to the top was insatiable. But she needed help and, while still in Paris, she found it in the shape of coach Patrick Mouratoglou, with whom she has been linked romantically. It was a partnership that was to restore Williams as the preeminent female player of her generation, culminating in her most successful season at the age of 32. ""What surprised me at that point was the motivation she had,"" Mouratoglou told CNN's Open Court show. ""She really was prepared to do anything to come back to the top. ""Her motivation was at the highest point, maybe, and it was very surprising for someone who had won so much, with such a career record and at that age. ""She was struggling a bit at the time because that loss really affected her, but she was motivated to work, so that's what she did."" The results speak for themselves. Serena has won 16 titles in 16 months, with a record of 95 victories and five defeats since teaming up with Mouratoglou. In 2013 she won 11 titles -- including the U.S. Open, French Open and season-ending WTA Championships -- the best return in women's tennis since Martina Hingis in 1997. Such a formidable run, which saw her pocket a cool $12.3 million in prize money this season, means she now has 17 grand slam titles to her name. Only three players in the Open era have more. But according to Mouratoglou, it was the humbling she was served in Paris that paved the way for this current, imperious streak. ""It's a failure, you have to accept it,"" he explained. ""When you have failure you can work to be better, and you realize sometimes it's good to come back to reality. ""That's how I see my role, to help her reduce the chances to lose to the strict minimum. ""I think the chances of her losing now are much smaller than in the past. If you look at the statistics they show it, but maybe we can do better -- and it's a real goal to do better."" That insistence Williams can reach even greater heights might make her rivals wince. There are very few players in the modern game who can match the sheer power and intensity of Williams at her peak. Though now in her thirties, Mouratoglou rejects any suggestions she is showing any signs of slowing down, and he thinks she can improve still further. ""For sure, she's unique,"" he said. ""I've worked with hundreds of players and many in the top 50 men and women -- for me, I've not seen anyone like her. ""She's a real champion. It's not about the strokes, it's about what you have inside -- and she has something really special inside. The quality of the game she is able to play at her age shows how much her game has evolved from most of the players. ""I think she improved in many ways her movement on the court; she moves much better, she moves longer also, she can play longer rallies, much longer if she needs to. ""I think she added some shots to her game that she was not using that much before. She wasn't using them because she wasn't mastering them like some other shots she masters like nobody else on tour. ""I think that's a key thing -- the more options she gets on tour in her game, the more chances to win she has on the first day of the year against the player who plays the best tennis of her career. ""If she plays her type of game with more efficiency, like being maybe even more aggressive, adding some volleys, some swing volleys for example, she can give another level, which is maybe a bit frightening, but I think she can."" Mouratoglou's influence has clearly galvanized Williams, but he insists it is her desire to take responsibility that makes her so unique. Whereas others might look in desperation to their coach for help if a match is getting away from them, Serena grits her teeth and figures it out for herself. ""She has this ability to find a solution to win, she refuses to lose and this is something really interesting,"" he said. ""Most of the players when they are in trouble, or they are struggling, they are complaining. ""She shouldn't think, 'I have to rely on someone' to find the solution,' because she has the solution within herself. She just has to analyze, think, and dig deep and find. ""Some (players) just complain and get angry, or give up -- that's the case of many players. And some others call their coach whenever they get broken: 'Oh, I need my coach!' ""Come on, you don't need your coach every time you're broken. You have to think what you should do and look for a solution, and this is something that Serena really has in herself."" So, with Serena in supreme form, is it conceivable she could smash all records in 2014 and win all four slams -- something not done since Steffi Graf in 1988? ""Yes, I think everything is possible,"" Mouratoglou says. ""Is it going to be easy? No, it's not going to be easy, because in terms of focus it's something really tough to achieve, and also we have to respect the quality of the other players.""","Serena Williams has had a resurgence under Patrick Mouratoglou's guidance .

"(CNN)Are you lonely? Bored? Trying to deflect questions about that special someone from Mom, Dad or your friends because there's nobody romantic in your life? Maybe you need an Invisible Boyfriend. Yes, the Internet has a solution for everything, and Invisible Boyfriend (or Girlfriend, they're not fussy) can take care of those pesky privacy-invading questions by supplying an actual person to call you, text you and leave you messages. They'll even send you handwritten notes. Why, that's sometimes better than an Actual Boyfriend! Matthew Homann, who describes himself as a ""recovering lawyer"" with ""idea surplus disorder,"" came up with the idea several years ago after a divorce and bought the domain InvisibleGirlfriend.com for $7. He filed it away until late 2013, when he pitched it to a St. Louis hackathon. A long weekend later, he and his team won the contest. That probably would have been it except for BuzzFeed, which picked up the story from a local alternative newspaper. Suddenly Homann -- who already had a full-time job running his company, an innovation-strategy firm called Kendeo -- realized that, thanks to the attention, Invisible Boyfriend had better be good. The result is a web service, launching in beta this week, that allows you to invent your potential partner. For $24.99 a month (for starters, which includes 100 text messages, voicemail and handwritten notes), you get to make up a story about how you met (the homepage includes a nice Mad Libs-style paragraph) and pick out an image, name, age and interests. Who's at the other end? Though Homann says some of that information is proprietary, he'll allow that the St. Louis-based company has partnered with a service that has real people responding to your messages. (Yes, they've been trained, so watch your language.) ""There has grown this amazing multinational workforce of people willing to do microtasks for a very small amount of money,"" he says. Not even he knows where they're all located, but he expects that the work will be scalable with demand. A Business Insider writer observed that her Invisible Boyfriend came from the city she requested, based on area code, and she praised the ""attention to detail."" Eventually, Invisible Boyfriend expects to offer gifts sent to you at work and other real-life services, says Homann. Not even Pygmalion had it so good. Ideas like Invisible Boyfriend have been fodder for generations of stories, of course. Think of ""Cyrano de Bergerac,"" who supplies poetry to the lunkheaded Christian to woo Roxane; or the movie ""Her,"" in which Joaquin Phoenix's sad sack falls in love with a computer operating system. What lonely person wouldn't like someone understanding to talk to, even if just through a device? Homann admits he's thought about it. ""There's a very real possibility that people might grow attached, though that's not what we're trying to go for here,"" he says. But he believes his service can be useful to build customers' confidence. ""We had a user who was at dinner on a date. His text message went off, he texted her back, and all of a sudden the woman across the table from him asked who it was,"" he says. The real-life date, he says, wasn't upset at all, but became more intrigued. ""What we're seeing is potential user cases are all over the board,"" Homann says. ""It's not just, I want to convince my parents I'm in a relationship.""","Online service ""Invisible Boyfriend"" creates a virtual romance with a fake person .

"(CNN) -- The first weekend of the Winter Olympics brought us moments of humor and technical problems from the Opening Ceremony, a skater's reaction that went viral and the sparkling debut of a sport where ""stoked"" and ""dude"" are part of a winning news conference. That face . Oh, how we love figure skating, a sport with subjective scores. And just like gymnastics -- another subjective scoring sport -- two years ago, it's given us what should become an Olympic Internet meme. On Saturday, U.S. skater Ashley Wagner went to the kiss-and-cry area to await her score in the women's short program of the team competition. She obviously expected a higher score than she received. A picture of her pouty face after the score was announced is drawing as much attention as the one that showed gymnast McKayla Maroney's reaction after she got a silver medal in 2012. But if you watch videos of Wagner's reaction, she also seemed to use her potty mouth, saying something with bull in it. ""I know roughly when I skate a good program where the score should end up. So to score that low was very disappointing for me,"" Wagner said. Wagner's the early favorite to become the meme star of the Games. She might have to compete with American bobsledder Johnny Quinn and one smashed-out bathroom door. Bobsledder to front desk: Yeah, I need a new door . Smashing debut . Step aside for a second, curling. It looks like slopestyle is a new fan favorite. Especially in the United States, which took gold in both the men's and women's events. Jamie Anderson and Sage Kotsenburg turned many viewers into fans with their winning performances. At its first Games, the sport lit up the first two days of Sochi. In a very unscientific poll, CNN users said the women's final was more exciting than the men's, which left a lot of people pretty stoked, including the surprise winner. Incredibly, Sage (you can't call a snowboarder by his last name, can you?) won while breaking out a new trick. After all, what did he have to lose? Besides a gold medal. ""I just kind of do random stuff. I had no idea I'd do a 1620 (four-and-a-half rotation spin) until three minutes before I dropped. I invented that (the self-named 'Holy Crail') a few months ago, and it was sick to do it on the first try."" Kotsenburg dude looks like Spicoli . In the women's final Jamie was no surprise. She dominated this season, according to Bleacher Report. How did she prepare for the big day? ""Last night I was so nervous I didn't eat. I put on the meditation music, burnt some sage and did some yoga,"" she said. We're guessing there weren't too many other people in the athletes' village doing that. Viral moments from the Opening Ceremony . Things don't always go according to script at the Opening Ceremony. Four years ago in Vancouver, a really cool lighting of the cauldron went awry when one of the four arms didn't rise from the floor of the stadium. On Friday night, five snowflake lights were supposed to morph into the five Olympics rings. OK, a minor glitch in what was otherwise a terrific show. Nothing to send someone to Siberia over. Or kill. So don't believe it when you see the headline in your Facebook news feed: ""Man Responsible For Olympic Ring Mishap Found Dead In Sochi."" The person who posted it and wrote, ""Is this true?"" didn't take much time to check the Internet to see if something they posted on the Internet was true. It was satire from the Daily Currant, which also once ran the headline: ""Marijuana Overdoses Kill 37 In Colorado on First Day of Legalization."" In Russia, viewers saw the snowflakes work . What was true at the Opening Ceremony was the picture that came with the caption, ""Russian Police Choir Performs 'Get Lucky' at Opening Ceremony."" Yes, Daft Punk's catchy ""Get Lucky."" Yes, the Russian police have a choir. Yes, many of them have perplexed looks on their faces. Family tradition for downhill skier . There are now two Olympic medals in his family after Austria's Matthias Mayer picked the perfect moment to win his first major downhill. In upsetting pre-race favorites Bode Miller of the United States and world downhill champion Aksel Lund Svindal of Norway, the 23-year-old skier added his gold to his father Helmut's super-G silver in 1988. ""This is unbelievable. I thought maybe in a few years I could dream of this sort of achievement. It was really cool and my family will be excited,"" he said. For Svindal, the disappointment is huge. ""It is pretty much the worst place to be,"" he said. Miller, at 36 the old man of alpine skiing, finished eighth in his last Olympic downhill. He seemed to be in good shape until he hit a gate, Bleacher Report said. ""I'm not really sure what went wrong,"" he said. ""The visibility is different today and that's the only disadvantage I had. But it's something I face all the time. If the visibility is really good, I can ski my best; if it isn't, I can't. I wanted to ski (the course) as hard as I could and not really back off, but it requires a lot of tactics today, which I didn't apply."" He still has the super combined on Friday -- the event he won in 2010 -- for a chance at a sixth career medal. The host nation comes to life . And a 15-year-old shall lead them. Russia picked up four medals on Sunday, sparked by figure skater Julia Lipnitskaia, who crushed the competition in the women's free skate program of the team event, a day after winning the short program. And her team smoked the competition to win the host nation's first gold medal of the Games. The win pleased No. 1 Russia fan, President Vladimir Putin, but he reminded the team he hoped for more medals. ""He congratulated us at the boards, which was great. He said, 'Well done, but don't relax, you still have the individual events to come,'"" Ekaterina Bobrova said. He was so happy, he almost managed a smile, reported CNN's Eoghan Macguire. Russia also won medals in the women's biathlon sprint (silver), men's singles luge (silver) and women's 3,000-meter speed skating event. Back to the ice, there's a bit of bad news for the other women in the individual competition. ""Now I fully know the ice and the arena I can relax a bit and skate better in the individual event than I did today,"" Lipnitskaia said after the team event. ""I will work hard on the free program after the small issues today."" You read that right: as good as she was Sunday, she thinks she will be better.","Ashley Wagner appeared to say a bad word after her score was announced .

"A former medical assistant testified Thursday that she saw more than 10 babies born alive at the West Philadelphia abortion clinic where she worked for a doctor who is now on trial for murder. Kareema Cross also saw babies or fetal remains in a toilet, a plastic box and jars, she told the court in the trial of Dr. Kermit Gosnell, who is charged with eight counts of murder. He is accused of killing seven babies after allegedly performing illegal late-term abortions and Karnamaya Mongar, 41, who died of an anesthetic overdose during a second-trimester abortion. He has pleaded not guilty. Gosnell's defense attorney Jack McMahon has maintained that none of the infants was killed; rather, they were already dead because Gosnell had administered the abortion drug Digoxin. Cross, 28, who stopped working at the clinic in 2009 when she gave birth to a child, reported Gosnell to authorities using the name of a relative, she said. Cross said Gosnell regularly performed illegal late-term abortions that he routinely recorded as ""24.5 weeks."" In Pennsylvania, abortions past 24 weeks are illegal unless the health of the mother is at stake. Cross graphically described witnessing Gosnell cut the necks of several babies while she worked at the clinic. She recalled being present for more than 10 instances in which babies were delivered alive by patients given abortion drugs. ""Were those babies breathing?"" Assistant District Attorney Joanne Pescatore asked. ""Yes,"" Cross replied. And then there was the time a mother gave birth while sitting on the toilet. ""It was swimming a bit,"" she said, ""basically, trying to get out of the toilet."" She also described a baby so large that his arms and legs hung over the sides a plastic box that resembled a shoe box. ""That was the largest baby I ever saw,"" she said matter-of-factly, indicating with her hands he was 12 to 18 inches long, before adding that Gosnell commented on his size. ""He'd say, 'the baby's big enough to walk to the bus stop,' "" she said. When Cross questioned Gosnell about seeing a baby moving or breathing, he told her what she saw was ""not real"" and that there were instead involuntary spasms, she said. ""I thought they were breathing; he said they weren't,"" Cross said. Jurors were also shown a series of photos Cross took with her digital camera to document the unsavory conditions inside the Women's Medical Society after she become disturbed by the Gosnell's business practices. Cross admitted to having an abortion herself at a different clinic in 2007 because she was uncomfortable with the conditions at Gosnell's facility. Jars containing the severed feet of babies lined a shelf. Furniture and equipment was blood-stained, dusty and broken. Cross pleaded guilty to drug charges in a federal case in which Gosnell is charged with illegally selling prescriptions. She was not charged in the murder trial involving Gosnell. The clinic was initially raided in 2010 for illegal prescription drug activity, not the doctor's abortion practices. When authorities searched Gosnell's practice, they found bags and bottles holding aborted fetuses scattered throughout the building. Similar to testimony from other clinic employees, after a few months of working at the Women's Medical Society in August 2005 for $10 an hour, Gosnell had Cross working the ultrasound machine and assisting with abortion procedures, as well as other procedures she was not formally trained to do. Also on trial is Eileen O'Neill, 56, a medical school graduate who worked as a doctor at Gosnell's clinic. O'Neill, who did not have a medical license, is not charged with performing abortions but with participating in the operation of a ""corrupt organization."" If found guilty, Gosnell could be sentenced to death.","Dr. Kermit Gosnell is charged with murder in the deaths of seven babies and one woman .

"Britain's Prime Minister, David Cameron, has declared that when dealing with would-be ""terrorist fighters,"" he believes it should be easier to confiscate passports -- to stop people traveling, to prevent those who go abroad to fight from returning to the UK, and to deal decisively with those who are here. How exactly the Counter Terrorism Bill will be framed when it is published shortly remains unclear, but current proposals go beyond what is required and risk doing exactly what the U.N. Security Council insists on, which is to act in compliance with international law. ""Dealing decisively with those who are here"" sounds good, of course, and there are plenty of terrorism-related offences already on the statute books which can do duty. Whether more are needed is a matter for debate, but clearly, as the U.N. Security Council affirmed last September in its unanimous resolution on ""foreign terrorist fighters,"" states must also address the underlying factors, as well implementing rehabilitation and reintegration strategies. Denmark is working on the latter, but has anyone looked to see how they work? The Security Council says states are obliged to prevent the movement of terrorists by way of effective border and passport controls, and passports are probably the easiest target. British citizens have no legal right to a passport, which continues to be issued under the Royal Prerogative and therefore within the discretion of the Crown (in practice, the Identity and Passport Service acting for the Home Office). Passports can be withdrawn or ""canceled"" for a number of reasons, including public interest grounds such as suspicion that the holder might be involved in international organized crime or in terrorism. The surrender of a passport can also be required as a condition of bail. But what the British government now wants is a statutory power allowing it to seize and retain a canceled passport, so as to reduce the likelihood of it being used anyway. In practice, though, it will be difficult to stop people traveling in the absence of evidence of their intentions; their proposed destination may be a give-away, but what if their aims are not terrorism-related, but humanitarian? Many are keen to assist those injured or at risk because of conflict. The Security Council says there needs to be ""credible information"" and ""reasonable grounds"" to believe that an individual is traveling for terrorism-related purposes; it encourages the use of ""evidence-based traveler risk assessment."" But there are dangers here, and it rightly insists that authorities do not resort to profiling based on stereotypes which in turn reflect internationally prohibited grounds of discrimination. How will the UK apply such standards, and what protection will citizens have against arbitrary restrictions on freedom of movement? Will police officers be entitled to act simply on suspicion? In debating earlier legislation, the Government made it clear that ""suspicion"" was a ""lesser test"" than belief, and certainly far short of the standard of proof in criminal matters. These issues demand serious thought, if arbitrary power is to be avoided, and discretion confined and structured as the rule of law requires. It is in stopping citizens from returning, however, that the Government will run into trouble with the law. Exclusion orders have been used against UK citizens in the recent past, limiting freedom of movement between Great Britain and Northern Ireland from the 1970s to the 1990s; but these orders were an internal matter, applied to citizens within the United Kingdom, whereas the Prime Minister's notion is to exclude citizens from the UK. The new ""temporary exclusion orders,"" it is proposed, will include passport cancellation, entry on a ""no fly list,"" and sanctions against any airline carrying an ""excluded"" British citizen to the UK. Such orders may extend for up to two years, though why two years is anyone's guess, and not apparently evidence-based. Return following exclusion may be allowed, but could be conditioned on prosecution, restrictions on movement, or immersion in a ""de-radicalization programme"" -- the dice look loaded with presumptions -- and returning without permission could result in up to five years in jail. Humanitarian workers thus run the risk of becoming trapped in a war zone, while others -- rightly or wrongly suspected of criminal activity -- may be rendered effectively stateless in some transit state or half-way house, in both cases denied the protection which the state owes to its citizens, and allowing the United Kingdom to avoid the responsibility which it owes to other states. Time and again, the Security Council has stressed that whatever measures states take to deal with terrorist-related threats must comply with all their obligations under international law. Specifically, it has said that no state would be obliged to deny entry or require the departure from its territory of its own nationals or permanent residents. ""Exile,"" after all, is expressly prohibited by Article 9 of the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights, while Article 12(4) of the 1966 International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights declares that: ""No one shall be arbitrarily deprived of the right to enter his own country."" Cameron's statements regarding so-called jihadists are regrettably indiscriminate and premised on assumptions of guilt. He has called for a ""discretionary power"" to exclude citizens from the UK, though this seems to imply an arbitrary competence exercised according to the rule of government, not the legal certainty and procedural protection required by the rule of law, and with no regard either to the rights and interests of other states, or to the necessity for improved international cooperation. No state is obliged to accept another's ""temporarily excluded"" citizens. Any state would be fully within its rights to deport such a person to the UK, and the UK is duty-bound to readmit citizens not allowed to remain in other countries. Moreover, any state whose airline was sanctioned because it carried a UK citizen back to the UK, would be equally entitled to apply counter-measures against the UK, by reason of its unlawful conduct. As was the case earlier this year with deprivation of citizenship, the rush to legislation led to inadequate scrutiny by parliament and cursory consideration of the applicable international law. The result then -- as it may be again -- was a broadening of executive authority beyond what the rule of law in a representative democratic state requires and demands.

"(CNN)In the style capital of the world, AC Milan is looking to make a $340 million statement. The famed football club, seven-time champions of Europe and 18-time Italian champions, has unveiled plans to build a new stadium in the Portello area of the city with the aim of relocating in time for the start of the 2018-19 season. Italian clubs are looking to follow the example of Juventus, which opened its own super arena in 2011 on the site of the old Stadio delle Alpi. Roma also has a plans for a new stadium, while Udinese is currently renovating the Friuli stadium. The official video of the scale model of the new #ACMilan stadium in the Portello - Fiera Milano City area. https://t.co/7kRbflkVdV . Many stadiums in the country are not privately owned by the teams. Better stadia is seen by Italian clubs as a way to attracting more fans and thereby generate greater revenue to allow them to compete with their European counterparts. Milan's move would see the Rossoneri leave the Giuseppe Meazza Stadium it has shared with fierce rivals Inter since 1947. Design firm Arup is behind the proposed 48,000-seater stadium, which will be sunk 10 meters into the ground so as not to overly disrupt the landscape of the area. Arup were behind Bayern Munich's Allianz Arena and the Bird's Nest stadium in Beijing, built for the 2008 Olympic Games. A statement released on Milan's website also claimed the stadium would use the ""latest technology and sound-proof materials"" to minimize the noise heard in the surrounding areas. Inter's president Erick Thohir has expressed his desire to see his club move into a stadium of its own. Design consultants Manica has released concepts of a new home for Inter on its website.","AC Milan looking to build a new 48,000-seater stadium .

"Chris Christie, the New Jersey GOP Governor and possible 2016 White House contender, is slamming President Obama for passing the buck on the U.S. being ill prepared for the ISIS threat.

""It should be 'we,' Mr. President.  It's your administration and when you're the leader, you have to be held accountable for what they do. I was disturbed by that.

"A pair of polls released show Democratic Sen. Mark Udall falling behind his Republican opponent in the tight Colorado race for his seat. A Quinnipiac University poll released Thursday shows Udall trailing Rep. Cory Gardner by eight points. The poll comes less than a day after a USA Today/Suffolk University poll showed the race as a statistical dead heat, with Gardner leading the incumbent, 43% to 42%. The two nonpartisan polls are the first time Udall has been behind his opponent since the last Quinnipiac poll gave Gardner a 2-point lead in July. The race has looked like a tough contest since Gardner jumped into it, but polling over the last two weeks has given Udall a 2- to 6-point edge over his Republican opponent. Udall's campaign manager Adam Dunstone acknowledged on Twitter that his candidate is locked in a tight race, but dismissed any ""wild swings like you see in the news."" Republicans are closer than ever to retaking the Senate since Democrats took control in 2006, and a GOP win in Colorado could help tip the balance. Udall has tried to put daylight between his positions and President Barack Obama's policies as the President's poll numbers have dipped. The USA Today/Suffolk University poll showed 55% had an unfavorable view of Obama. And while Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper shared a beer with Obama in Denver in July, Udall wasn't in the picture for the photo-op. He was originally scheduled to attend a Denver fundraiser with the President, but made a last-minute change to stay on Capitol Hill for a vote. But Gardner's hefty lead in the Quinnipiac poll could also be an outlier: It's the second time this week that Quinnipiac has strayed from the pack of polls. The institution also gave Republican candidate Joni Ernst a 6-point lead against her Democratic opponent Bruce Braley in the equally contentious Iowa Senate race. Other polls have pointed to a dead heat in the Iowa contest.","A Quinnipiac University poll showed Sen. Udall trailing Rep. Cory Gardner 40-48% .

"Thirty soldiers until recently stationed in West Africa will be quarantined in Italy when they arrive Wednesday after leaving the Ebola-stricken region this morning, Army officials tell CNN. The soldier will join Army Major General  Darryl A. Williams, commander of U.S. Army Africa, and approximately 10 other personnel who are now in ""controlled monitoring"" in Italy after returning there from West Africa over the weekend, according to multiple U.S. military officials. The American personnel are effectively under quarantine, but Pentagon officials declined to use that terminology. Williams' plane was met on the ground by Italian authorities ""in full CDC gear,"" the official said, referring to the type of protective equipment worn by U.S. health care workers. There is no indication at this time any of the team have symptoms of Ebola. Ebola outbreak: Get up to speed with the latest developments . They will be monitored for 21 days at a ""separate location""  at the U.S. military installation at Vicenza Italy, according to U.S. military officials. Senior Pentagon officials say it is not a ""quarantine,"" but rather ""controlled monitoring."" However, the troops are being housed in an access controlled location on base, and are not allowed to go home for the 21 day period while they undergo twice daily temperature checks. It is not clear yet if they will be allowed visits from family members. 4 issues raised at the House Ebola hearing . Williams and his team have been in West Africa for 30 days, to set up the initial U.S. military assistance there and have traveled extensively around Liberia.  The team was in treatment and testing areas during their travels. Speaking to reporters two weeks ago while he was still overseas in Liberia, Williams spoke of the extensive monitoring that he was given. ""We measure, while we're here -- twice a day, are monitoring as required by the recent guidance that was put out while we're here in Liberia. I -- yesterday, I had my temperature taken, I think, eight times, before I got on and off aircraft, before I went in and out of the embassy, before I went out of my place where I'm staying,"" William said during the October 16 press conference. Boy under evaluation in New York; nurse ordered released . ""As long as you exercise basic sanitation and cleanliness sort of protocols using the chlorine wash on your hands and your feet, get your temperature taken, limiting the exposure, the -- no handshaking, those sorts of protocols, I think the risk is relatively low."" Officials could not explain why the group was being put under into controlled monitoring, which is counter to the Pentagon policy.  The current DOD policy on monitoring returning troops says ""as long as individuals remain asymptomatic, they may return to work and routine daily activities with family members."" White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said Monday that the Defense Department ""has not issued a policy related to their workers that have spent time in West Africa."" ""I know that there was this decision that was made by one commanding officer in the Department of Defense, but it does not reflect a department-wide policy that I understand is still under development,"" Earnest said. The Pentagon has, though, published plans that detail how it will handle troops who are deployed to the region -- including potential quarantines. Jessica L. Wright, the undersecretary of Defense for personnel and readiness, issued an Oct. 10 memo that said troops who have faced an elevated risk of exposure to Ebola will be quarantined for 21 days -- and that those who haven't faced any known exposure will be monitored for three weeks. Wright's memo also lays out the Pentagon's plans to train troops before they're sent to West Africa and to monitor them during their deployment to the epicenter of the Ebola outbreak. Pressed again during his briefing Monday, Earnest said it's up to the Defense Department to announce its policies for troops that return from the region. ""We are seeing this administration put in place the policies that we believe are necessary to protect the American people and to protect the American troops,"" he said. ""And we're going to let science drive that process. And as soon as we have a policy to announce on this, we'll let you know."" A senior military officials described the living quarters as one building with rooms equipped for between one and four people. The quarantined personnel will eat in a dining tent. They have a gym and they have access to both unclassified and classified means of communication, according to the official. The quarantined personnel are supposed to be getting access to chaplains soonest for worship services in the near future.","30 U.S. soldiers will join a group of approximately 10 in Italy already under quarantine.

"Authorities in Newtown, Connecticut, put together more pieces of the puzzle Saturday to explain what happened inside Sandy Hook Elementary School, one day after a gunman opened fire there, killing 20 students and six adults. All the victims died from gunshot wounds and were struck more than once, according to H. Wayne Carver II, chief medical examiner for the state of Connecticut. Their deaths were classified as homicides. ""I've been at this for a third of a century. My sensibilities may not be the average man, but this probably is the worst I have seen or the worst that I know of any of my colleagues having seen,"" Carver told reporters. The deadly school shooting shattered the quiet of this southern New England town and left a nation reeling over the number of lives, particularly young lives lost. It also reignited the perennial debate about gun laws in America. President Barack Obama spoke tearfully about the massacre on Friday and is scheduled to travel to Newtown on Sunday to meet with families of the victims. He will deliver remarks during an evening vigil. Law enforcement officials have identified the gunman as 20-year-old Adam Lanza. He apparently took his own life, after taking that of his mother and the 26 people at the school. Lanza was found dead next to three guns, a semi-automatic .223-caliber Bushmaster rifle and two pistols made by Glock and Sig Sauer, a law enforcement source told CNN. All belonged to his mother. Carver, who performed autopsies on seven of the victims, said the wounds he knew about were caused by a ""long weapon."" Asked by a reporter whether the rifle was the primary weapon, he responded, ""Yes."" He spoke as police released a list of the names of ages of the victims. Twelve girls and eight boys were killed, all either 6 or 7 years old. The adults ranged in ages from 27 to 56, and included the school's principal, psychologist and at least two teachers. Among those killed was Emilie Parker, 6. ""As the deep pain begins to settle into our hearts, we find comfort reflecting on the incredible person that Emilie was and how many lives that she was able to touch in her short time here on Earth,"" her father, Robbie Parker, told reporters, struggling to speak through tears. He described his daughter as bright, creative and loving. She loved to draw pictures and try new things. ""Emilie's laughter was infectious and all those who had the pleasure to meet her would agree that this world is a better place because she has been in it,"" her father said. Also killed were Dawn Hochsprung, the school's beloved principal, school psychologist Mary Sherlach, Vicki Soto, a first-grade teacher, and substitute teacher Lauren Rousseau. Searching for answers in their deaths, major crime investigators police were combing ""every crack and crevice"" of the school. They said they're finding some ""very good evidence"" there, and at the home of the shooter. Lanza's mother, Nancy, was killed at that house, authorities said. ""The detectives will certainly analyze everything and put a complete picture together of the evidence that they did obtain, and we're hopeful -- we're hopeful -- that it will paint a complete picture as to how and why this entire unfortunate incidence occurred,"" said Lt. J. Paul Vance, a spokesman for the Connecticut State Police. Authorities, meanwhile, in Hoboken, New Jersey, were questioning Ryan Lanza, the suspected gunman's older brother, law enforcement sources said, though they did not label him a suspect. Lanza's father, Peter, who lives in Connecticut, was similarly questioned, one of the law enforcement officials said. Peter Lanza released a statement Saturday expressing condolences to the families of victims. ""Our family is grieving along with all those who have been affected by this enormous tragedy. No words can truly express how heartbroken we are. We are in a state of disbelief and trying to find whatever answers we can,"" said the statement. Two law enforcement sources said Adam Lanza lived with his mother. Contrary to early reports, they said, Nancy Lanza was not a teacher at Sandy Hook Elementary. Nancy Lanza was a gun collector and recently showed off a newly bought rifle to fellow Newtown resident Dan Holmes, who owns a landscaping business in the town. Besides the three weapons found at the school, Adam Lanza also had access to at least three more guns, a law enforcement source said. Investigators recovered a .45-caliber Henry Repeating Rifle, a .22-caliber Marlin Rifle and a .30-caliber Enfield Rifle, though it's unclear where they were found, the source said. Investigators believe Lanza killed his mother and then took her guns and made his way to the elementary school wearing black fatigues and a military vest, according to a law enforcement official. According to Vance, Lanza forced his way into the school though he wouldn't say how or whether Lanza used weapons to do it. Authorities said it's also not clear whether Lanza entered before or after 9:30 a.m., the time each day when the school would lock its doors as part of a security system introduced this year. Authorities say the first emergency call about the shooting came in at ""approximately"" 9:30 a.m. Friday. Within minutes, 26 people had been killed with chilling efficiency, leaving only the one wounded survivor. The survivor, an adult, has not been named. ""She has been treated and she'll be instrumental in this investigation, as I'm sure you can understand,"" Vance said. The massacre in Newtown is the second-deadliest school shooting in U.S. history, behind the 2007 Virginia Tech mass shooting that left 32 dead. ""Stuff like this does not happen in Newtown,"" said Renee Burn, a teacher at another school in the town, which is roughly 75 miles northeast of New York City. Until Friday, only one homicide in the past 10 years had been reported in the upscale community of expansive homes surrounded by woods, where many residents commute to jobs in Manhattan and the nearby Connecticut cities of Stamford and Hartford. Flags were lowered to half-staff in a number of states, and vigils were held at houses of worship and at schools amid a national outpouring of grief. What really makes schools safer?

"Percy von Lipinski stood on a chair as he decorated his family's Christmas tree. While hanging a German glass ornament, he lost his balance and grabbed a branch, pricking his left hand on a pine needle as he regained his footing. Sounds pretty benign, right? At this point, Von Lipinski, 57, had no idea that the incident in 2008 would nearly cost him his entire hand -- and perhaps his life. What seemed like an insignificant injury resulted in a flesh-eating disease from necrotizing fasciitis, the same condition that's responsible for two serious cases in the United States that have recently risen to prominence. ""I've told this story to many people to make them aware that, yes, this can happen to you,"" said von Lipinski, who lives in Vancouver, British Columbia. ""Never, ever take an infection for granted."" This month, Aimee Copeland, a 24-year-old student at the University of West Georgia, had to have her leg amputated, then her other foot and her hands, because of the same flesh-eating disease. She had fallen from a zipline and cut her leg May 1. She had been on a ventilator but is now breathing on her own, her father said Sunday. As of Tuesday, Copeland remains in critical condition. Lana Kuykendall has had seven surgeries as a result of the disease, and she has been ""intubated and sedated"" since arriving at the hospital May 11, her brother said. She had been healthy when she gave birth to twins May 7 but went to the hospital when she noticed a bruise on her leg. She remains hospitalized in critical condition. Von Lipinski's experience, which he shared with CNN's iReport, was far less severe than these women's but could have been worse had his infection not been detected so early. There are many strains of bacteria that cause the flesh-eating disease necrotizing fasciitis. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that there are about 9,000 to 11,500 cases of group A streptococcus bacteria, one cause of nectrotizing fasciitis, each year. Of them, only 6% to 7% are invasive. More commonly, the bacteria results in infections such as strep throat or a skin infection called impetigo. Copeland's infection was caused by a bacterial strain called Aeromonas hydrophila, which is so rare that there are no good statistics on this cause of flesh-eating disease. The CDC says that about 25% of patients who have nectrotizing fasciitis die. Canada has 90 to 200 cases per year, with a fatality rate of 20% to 30%, according to the Public Health Agency of Canada. At Christmastime 2008, Von Lipinski didn't think much about the pine needle prick until the redness started spreading and he experienced abnormal pain. He and his wife, obstetrician-gynecologist Dr. Olga von Lipinski, were having dinner with a group of doctors. They recommended antibiotics, which the von Lipinskis had at home. But von Lipinski's wife knew something was wrong when he kept getting up during the night, unable to sleep because of the pain. By morning, the wound on his hand had worsened. Von Lipinski's story is typical of what Dr. William Schaffner, chairman of the Department of Preventive Medicine at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, knows of these sorts of infections. The telltale signs of a problem are a fever and persistent pain that's disproportionate to the injury: Sometimes it's ""the worst pain they've ever experienced,"" he said. About 10% of patients can remember no injury at all before the infection begins, he said. Some cases involve deep penetrating injuries, such as Copeland's. Others, like von Lipinski's, are more trivial. But infection can begin even if the skin isn't broken; a blunt trauma can trigger it, too. Still, plenty of people have these injuries every day and never develop flesh-eating disease; it's somewhat mysterious why a small segment of people do. ""You need a combination of circumstances that all have to mesh perfectly for this kind of event to take hold,"" Schaffner said. Sometimes the bacteria are external, but in some cases, the person is already carrying the bacteria on them or even inside them. As with many illnesses, vulnerability to flesh-eating bacterial infections increases with age and underlying conditions that might compromise the immune system. A delay in care for a wound also predisposes a person to a worse outcome. ""I certainly look at every tiny cut, paper cuts, shaving, building in a different much more serious way now,"" von Lipinski said. Three feet of snow fell overnight while the infection spread in von Lipinski's hand. He had looked forward to spending the day making their home more ""Christmassy."" But his wife insisted about 6 a.m. on taking him to the emergency room on her way to work. ""There is no way, if my wife hadn't insisted, I would have gone to the hospital,"" von Lipinski said. Doctors told von Lipinski he would be on an intravenous antibiotic drip for four hours and then could go home. His wife was told he would be home for dinner. But the drug didn't work, and von Lipinski's condition was getting worse. He was rushed to the intensive care unit. Von Lipinski's hand appeared to double in size -- like ""a science fiction makeup job."" ""It was getting very hard to move my fingers,"" he said. ""I couldn't picture how I was going to regain use of my hand again,"" he said. There's a lot he doesn't remember, but one conversation does stick out: his wife talking to her 5-year-old daughter about how good people go to heaven. ""Everything was happening so fast around me, and it wasn't actually until I heard those words out of my wife, talking to my daughter, that I thought, 'Geez, I could die,' "" von Lipinski remembers. ""I've never seen him so sick,"" his wife said. ""It's a truly scary thing. You don't want see anybody, especially your relatives, in this kind of condition."" Within 48 hours, one of the combinations of antibiotics started to work. Nurses had drawn lines with a black marker to show the progression of the infection, but it had started to retreat. Surgeons removed dead tissue from the hand. Fortunately, they didn't have to amputate. Surgery is the most important treatment for the condition. Antibiotics and supportive care are also important, said Schaffner, who did not treat von Lipinski. Staying ahead of the infection by getting rid of the dead tissue is crucial. ""It's not unusual for a surgeon to have to go back a second time and a third time because these infections -- look at that young lady in Georgia -- can spread in a very determined and rapid and persistent fashion,"" Schaffner said. The best case scenario, von Lipinski was told, was that he wouldn't be able to move his hand again and would have frozen fingers for the rest of his life. At that point, von Lipinski felt grateful that he would keep his hand at all, even if it would be paralyzed. Von Lipinski remained in the hospital for about two weeks. Contrary to the predictions of his doctors, he eventually regained the use of his left fingers, although it took 18 to 24 months. A year after the accident, he could barely form a fist. Only scars remain from the surgery, and he now has full function of his hand. ""When you face death directly as I did with this experience, you tend to look at life differently,"" he said. ""Money and other typical life challenges are instantly made trivial when I think back at how lucky I was!""","iReporter Percy von Lipinski of Vancouver, British Columbia, had flesh-eating disease .

"Famed hip-hop rapper Jay Jenkins, known as ""Young Jeezy,"" was arrested on Sunday in relation to a deadly shooting at a Wiz Khalifa concert, police said.

"(CNN) -- Bail was set at $50,000 Friday night for a GOP campaign worker who made up a story about being attacked by a man angered by a John McCain bumper sticker on her car. Police say Ashley Todd admitted making up the report that she was attacked because of a McCain sticker. Ashley Todd, 20, of College Station, Texas, has been charged with filing a false police report, a misdemeanor, a police report said. Todd, who is being held at the Allegheny County Jail in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, did not enter a plea when she appeared in court Friday night. She did not post bail. She is scheduled to appear in court again October 30, when she is expected to enter a plea. If she posts bail, Todd must be evaluated at a behavioral clinic. ""This has wasted so much time. ... It's just a lot of wasted man hours,"" Assistant Police Chief Maurita Bryant said at a briefing. Todd was a volunteer for a John McCain phone bank in Pittsburgh, the campaign said. The woman told investigators a man approached her Wednesday night at an ATM in Pittsburgh's East End, put a blade to her neck and demanded money, said Pittsburgh police spokeswoman Diane Richard. Police said they found ""several inconsistencies"" in Todd's statement and she was not seen in surveillance videos taken at the ATM. She was asked to take a polygraph test Friday morning, Richard said. The results were not made public. Later, Todd came to the police station to help work on a composite sketch of the alleged attacker. When she arrived, Todd ""told them she just wanted to tell the truth"" -- that she was not robbed, and there was no attacker, Bryant said. Todd originally told police a man ""punched her in the back of the head, knocking her to the ground, and he continued to punch and kick her while threatening to teach her a lesson for being a McCain supporter,"" according to a police statement. The woman also told police her attacker ""called her a lot of names and stated that 'You are going to be a Barack supporter,' at which time she states he sat on her chest, pinning both her hands down with his knees, and scratched into her face a backward letter 'B' on the right side of her face using what she believed to be a very dull knife."" Bryant described Todd as ""very cordial, polite, cooperating,"" and said the woman was surprised by all the media attention. Asked whether the false report was politically motivated, Bryant replied, ""It's difficult to say."" ""She is stating that she was in her vehicle driving around, and she came up with this idea,"" she said. ""She said she has prior mental problems and doesn't know how the backward letter 'B' got on her face."" However, Todd was the only one in the vehicle, and ""when she saw the 'B' she thought she must have been the one who did it,"" Bryant said. ""We're talking with the district attorney's office and conferring on just how we're going to handle it,"" she said. ""It's been different stories through the night and this morning."" She said there was no indication that anyone else was involved. Richard said the woman had described her alleged attacker as an African-American, 6 feet 4 inches tall with a medium build and short dark hair, wearing dark clothing and shiny shoes. Before the revelation that the report was false, McCain spokeswoman Jill Hazelbaker said that McCain and running mate Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin ""spoke to the victim and her family after learning about the incident."" The Obama campaign also had issued a statement wishing the woman a ""speedy recovery.""","NEW: Ashley Todd has yet to post $50,000 bail for allegedly filing false police report .

"Tampa (CNN) -- Perhaps it was because Rep. Michele Bachmann was in her element at the CNN/Tea Party Republican Debate. With her campaign flagging, the founder of the Tea Party Caucus in Congress delivered a surprise body blow to the GOP front-runner, Texas Gov. Rick Perry. Challenging Perry on his 2007 executive order that required Texas schoolgirls to receive vaccinations against the sexually transmitted HPV virus, Bachmann suggested the governor acted for purely political reasons. ""I just wanted to add that we cannot forget that in the midst of this executive order there is a big drug company that made millions of dollars because of this mandate. We can't deny that,"" Bachmann said. She went on to point out that at the time of the executive order, Perry's former chief of staff was a top lobbyist for Merck, the manufacturer for the HPV vaccine. ""The drug company gave thousand of dollars in political donations to the governor,"" Bachmann said. ""And this is just flat-out wrong."" Fact check: Did Bachmann's drug lobbyist claims ring true? The moment came as CNN moderator Wolf Blitzer was about to turn to former Sen. Rick Santorum for his take on the controversy. But Perry was given a chance to respond. ""The company was Merck, and it was a $5,000 contribution that I had received from them. I raise about $30 million. And if you're saying that I can be bought for $5,000, I'm offended,"" Perry replied. Bachmann, who was reluctant to do battle in last week's debate in California, could have landed a knockout punch. She could have asked: ""So governor, what is your price?"" But she allowed the debate to move on. Still, the congresswoman from Minnesota revived a long-running but largely overlooked complaint about Perry. Adversaries of the Texas governor have said for years he is a ""crony capitalist."" Jim Hightower, the man Perry beat in his first statewide race for Texas agriculture commissioner, often says there are three ways to look at the state's longest-serving governor -- ""cronyism, phonyism and goofyism."" Perry's allies can brush off Hightower. But not former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin. In her strongest indication yet she may enter the race for the GOP nomination, Palin strongly condemned Perry's actions in an interview on Fox News after the debate. ""This is crony capitalism. That's part of the problem we have in this country. People are afraid, even within our own party, to call one another out on that,"" Palin said. Perry was in damage control for most of the night. The first question of the debate came from a tea party activist who wanted to know how the candidates would change Social Security and sell the reforms to Florida's crucial senior citizen voters. But the opening round was really about the Texas governor, who has called Social Security a ""Ponzi scheme."" Read more about whether Perry is conflicted on Social Security . ""It has been called a Ponzi scheme by many people long before me. But no one's had the courage to stand up and say, 'Here is how we're going to reform it,' "" Perry said. Former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney tried to pin down his arch rival on what exactly that overhaul would look like. ""Do you still believe that Social Security should be ended as a federal program?"" Romney asked. ""I think we ought to have a conversation,"" Perry replied. ""We're having that right now, governor. We're running for president,"" Romney shot back. ""And I'll finish this conversation,"" Perry answered. Fact check: Is Social Security a ""Ponzi scheme?' For most of the night, the debate was about Perry. That's usually a sign a candidate is winning. Former Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman and Santorum tried on several occasions to draw the Texas governor into their own rhetorical duels, to no avail. That's usually a sign a candidate is losing. ""Let me say for Rick to say that you can't secure the border I think is pretty much a treasonous comment,"" Huntsman said. It was an attempt to hit Perry on border security by resurrecting the Texas governor's controversial comment that Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke would be guilty of treason if he took actions to stabilize the economy during an election cycle. Perhaps it was too much for the audience to absorb. Perry took his knocks. But his status as a front-runner was still intact, at least for the moment. On Thursday, Perry is scheduled to visit Virginia. That's not a terribly important primary state for Republicans. But it is a crucial battleground in the general election, a sign of Perry's Texas-size confidence. The trick for the rest of the GOP field is to convince Republican voters the race is not over yet.","Most of debate centers on Texas Gov. Rick Perry -- usually a sign a candidate is winning .

"BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN) -- The Iraqi man who was jailed after throwing his shoes at then-President George W. Bush last year arrived in Syria on Tuesday night, hours after being released from prison, his employer said. Muntadhar al-Zaidi speaks to reporters shorlty after his release from an Iraqi jail. Al-Baghdadia TV said Muntadhar al-Zaidi had arrived in Damascus. Al-Zaidi's brother, Dhirgham al-Zaidi, told CNN that the 30-year-old journalist was to travel in a private plane to Greece for medical treatment. Shortly after he left prison, the 30-year-old journalist visited the studios of his employer, Al-Baghdadia TV, where he spoke to other reporters about his experience. He wore a sash in the colors of the Iraqi national flag draped around his shoulders. Muntadhar al-Zaidi said he was beaten with cables and pipes and tortured with electricity immediately after guards removed him from a news conference for hurling both shoes at Bush. He said he was taken into another room and beaten even as the news conference continued. However, he remained defiant about the incident that landed him in prison. ""I got my chance, and I didn't miss it,"" he said. ""I am not a hero, and I admit that,"" he added. ""I am a person with a stance. I saw my country burning."" Al-Zaidi, who was serving a one-year sentence after the jail-throwing incident December 14, was given a ""conditional discharge."" Under Iraqi law, a ""conditional discharge"" allows for the release of a prisoner after he serves three-quarters of his sentence, on good behavior.  Watch more about al-Zaidi's release » . Al-Zaidi said he was compelled to act after witnessing what the U.S. invasion had wrought on his country: orphans, widows, refugees. He said he promised those affected by the war that should he get the opportunity, he would avenge their loss. That chance came at the news conference, when al-Zaidi threw both his shoes at Bush and called him a ""dog,"" two of the worst insults in the Middle East. Bush ducked the shoes and was not hurt. During his remarks, al-Zaidi offered one apology: to fellow journalists who perceived his act as unprofessionalism. Sound off: Was a jail sentence too harsh a punishment? ""Professionalism does not preclude nationalism,"" he said. Al-Zaidi was sentenced to jail for ""assaulting a foreign head of state on an official visit to Iraq."" His original three-year sentence was reduced to a single year by an appellate court in April. The journalist's family and supporters had waited for two days outside the Baghdad jail where he was held, initially hoping he would be freed Monday, but procedural delays kept that from happening. Last week, al-Zaidi's family prepared for his release, plastering the walls of their modest Baghdad home with his posters. ""We are happy, like any detainee's family would be happy for the release of its son after the bitter time he spent in jail,"" brother Dhirgham al-Zaidi said. He said the family had received many phone calls from supporters across the country who planned to travel to Baghdad and welcome al-Zaidi after his release. Though many Iraqis hold Bush in low esteem, opinions were mixed in Iraq following the incident. Some viewed al-Zaidi as a hero, with thousands taking to the streets, calling for his release; others said his act went against Arab traditions of honoring guests. Al-Zaidi's brothers said they had been offered many gifts and financial rewards, though they had rejected them. CNN's Jomana Karadsheh and Cal Perry contributed to this report.","NEW: Journalist's brother says he's headed to Greece to get medical treatment .

"Israeli politicians have reached an agreement on a new government that excludes ultra-religious parties, which have almost always been a part of the ruling coalition. The main ultra-orthodox Shas Party will join the Labor Party in the opposition rows of the Knesset, Israel's parliament. It leaves the governing coalition with no party that traditionally trumpets the concerns of the poor. After weeks of negotiations, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu forged a coalition deal with centrists and ultra-conservatives after his conservative Likud Beitenu Party landed a solid lead in Israel's January 22 national election, Likud spokeswoman Noga Katz said. The Knesset holds 120 seats, and more than 60 are usually needed to form a coalition government. But Netanyahu has said he wanted to build a large majority, and he has achieved that goal by signing on enough parties to garner 68 seats, Katz said. The centrist Yesh Atid party, less than a year old, made an impressive debut in its first election, receiving 19 Knesset seats to become the second largest member of the new government. The Jewish Home Party, which supports the expansion of Jewish settlements in the Palestinian West Bank territory, also signed on to the coalition. So did ""The Movement"" of Tzipi Livni, another centrist party. Livni, a former opposition leader, foreign minister and justice minister, will again serve in the justice minister post. Her party was the first to join Netanyahu's coalition. As top priorities for the new government, the prime minister named fiscal responsibility, lowering the cost of living in Israel and containing Iran's nuclear ambitions.","Ultra-orthodox parties are out after years of being in .

"Amid the chaos of flying bullets, roaming checkpoints guarded by gunmen, and the constant threat of a street battle erupting around the corner at any moment, a new underground television channel has become must-see TV for residents of Aleppo, Syria. It doesn't look like much. Aleppo Today TV, with it photographic slideshow of Aleppo in happier times accompanied by Syrian music, is not what many would expect from a 24-hour news channel. But two rolling news bars at the bottom of the screen have become a vital news source for residents navigating the shifting violence in Syria's largest city. ""Aleppo Today started at a time when a person in Aleppo might know that someone a couple of blocks away got killed, or a demonstration happened in the next neighborhood,"" wrote Omar Halabi, the assistant manager of Aleppo Today, in an e-mail to CNN. Read more: As fighting subsides, Aleppo residents find little left . Aleppo Today now broadcasts from a country neighboring Syria. Due to security concerns and because their broadcasts have been jammed by the Syrian regime at least four times, the channel's managers do not want their base of operations disclosed. The channel's management says it can't broadcast anything more than still images because it can't afford the bandwidth. To avoid jamming by the Syrian government, Aleppo Today's news director said, the network uploads and beams its content through at least two other countries before it is finally sent into Syria. ""We have to be sneaky, we have to be undercover,"" said ""Ahmed,"" one of the channel's news editors. For the safety of his family still living in Aleppo, the 23-year old Syrian, who worked as a baker until the uprising began more than 20 months ago, asked not to have his named published in full. Read more: Syrian opposition gets recognition; fight rages on . Aleppo Today's approach to aggregating, sourcing and writing reliable news about the violence in Aleppo put the station in the cross-hairs of the regime and boosted its popularity. ""The regime saw us as a huge target because of the unique approach we took compared to other opposition channels,"" Halabi wrote. ""The result: everybody watched our channel including regime supporters."" In the Aleppo Today newsroom, 11 editors from Aleppo and its countryside sit in front of computers in shifts, quietly gathering reports from 70 reporters and volunteers living in and around Syria's largest city. It can be hard to keep lines of communication open to the reporters. Electricity in Aleppo is intermittent and the Internet goes down frequently. Most of the reporters file over Skype, gChat and Facebook. There are satellite Internet and phone setups, but not everyone on staff in Syria has access to secure communications. Read more: An afternoon with a Syrian bombmaker . Ahmed describes Aleppo Today's way of reporting: ""One reporter might say he saw a bomb in a neighborhood. If he says he saw, then we write it. But if he says he heard, then we ask other people in that area if they heard, if they did then we write."" On particularly grim days in Aleppo, Ahmed's Skype account, which is usually full of reporters, contacts and family members, can suddenly go quiet. These moments prompt him to scroll through the list trying to find any new developments because ""there is always something."" The channel is trying something new through double-sourcing and its policy of censoring foul language, a hard task when many in Syria refer to the country's president as a dog and routinely curse his supporters. Aleppo Today is also trying to remain impartial in its coverage of the opposition, according to the channel's employees. But not everyone thinks that Aleppo Today is maintaining a balanced view. With so many opposition groups in Syria, the political landscape is full of competing organizations, political parties, and councils, many of which are vying for positions in power after what most Syrians see as the inevitable fall of Bashar al-Assad. ""I am with the opposition but I don't want to work for the opposition,"" said Samir Kanjo, a former news editor at the channel. He left after disagreements over broadcast policy. Kanjo claimed the channel was turning into a mouthpiece for the Transitional Revolutionary Council, one of the larger political opposition groups active in Aleppo. ""We do not work for a group, we work for all Syrians,"" said Feras Dibbeh, who replaced Kanjo as the news editor. Dibbeh insisted Aleppo Today is apolitical, and funded only by concerned Syrian businessmen who prefer to remain anonymous. Those entrepreneurs apparently have plans to expand their media properties. Dibbeh showed CNN journalists a small, makeshift studio his colleagues were in the process of constructing. Dibbeh said the studio will soon be home to a new FM radio station that also will broadcast to Aleppo, yet another addition to Syria's rapidly transforming media landscape.","Aleppo Today broadcasts from a country neighboring Syria .

"The ex-madam and political candidate who claimed she supplied former New York Gov. Eliot Spitzer with escorts pleaded guilty Friday to pushing prescription drugs, the U.S. Attorney's Office said. Kristin Davis, 38, who ran against Spitzer for the office of comptroller, admitted in Manhattan federal court to one count of ""distributing and possessing with intent to distribute controlled substances, specifically alprazolam, zolpidem and carisoprodol,"" Preet Bharara, U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York, said in a statement. Bharara said Davis illegally sold ""hundreds of highly-addictive and dangerous prescription pills"" and helped fuel ""the fastest-growing drug problem in the country"" and a ""public health epidemic."" Davis faces up to 5 years in prison when she is sentenced July 25. Under the plea agreement, she also agreed to forfeit $1,765. Her lawyer, Daniel Hochheiser, told CNN that he plans to ask for leniency. ""I'm hoping that she can remain at liberty so that she can pursue her new career and complete her current studies,"" he said. ""She's going to school ... but at this point I just want to protect her privacy. It's more career-oriented ... to put herself in a position to gain new skills so she pursue a new career once this case is wrapped up."" Davis was arrested on the drug charges last August when she was running an unsuccessful campaign for comptroller against Spitzer. The former governor has denied using the services of the ex-madam. Based on a tip from an FBI witness, agents set up a sting operation from January through March of 2013 and caught her pushing pills on three separate occasions to the witness, who she believed to be a drug dealer, prosecutors said. Davis became synonymous with the prostitution scandal involving Spitzer, then serving as governor. She never provided proof that she  arranged escorts for Spitzer, but she did spend four months behind bars for running an escort firm. Spitzer, a Democrat, resigned in 2008. The former governor has denied using the services of the ex-madam. A former hedge fund senior vice president, Davis ran as a Libertarian with a plan to legalize marijuana in New York City.

"(Travel + Leisure) -- One of Southern California's prettiest escapes is just a short skip from Los Angeles. All you need is three days and the right itinerary. Ojai is a haven for artists and musicians. DAY 1 . Check in: The 220-acre Ojai Valley Inn & Spa (905 Country Club Rd.; 800/422-6524 or 805/646-1111; doubles from $400) was recently overhauled to the tune of $90 million. The result: 308 refreshed rooms, with four-poster beds and adobe fireplaces, plus the Artist Cottage, which hosts crafts classes and aromatherapy workshops. A full slate of activities such as golf, tennis and hiking mean you'll never have to leave the property. In the heart of town, try the Mission revival-style, all-suite Su Nido Inn (301 N. Montgomery St.; 866/646-7080 or 805/646-7080; doubles from $329). All nine rooms have super-plush beds and custom tile work; three have vaulted ceilings. Take a hike: Of the 24 hiking paths that crisscross the valley, the 6 1/2-mile Last Chance Trail, which winds through the forested Santa Paula Canyon, is the most beautiful -- and the most popular. To avoid crowds, opt for the Shelf Road Trail, with its dramatic valley views. Grab a bite: Dine by candlelight on the slate patio at Suzanne's Cuisine (502 W. Ojai Ave.; 805/640-1961; dinner for two $80), a 15-year-old local institution that serves Mediterranean-inspired dishes made with organic produce from area farmers. Hit the town: Ojai's not known for its nightlife, but those looking to unwind can head to the art-filled Movino (308 E. Ojai Ave.; 805/646-1555), a sultry little wine bar where residents and visitors alike mingle over glasses of regional favorites; the 54-bottle list includes three from the Ojai valley itself. DAY 2 . Start fresh: Begin the day at the low-key Ojai Café Emporium (108 S. Montgomery St.; 805/646-2723; breakfast for two $15) with just-baked blueberry muffins or decadent cinnamon-roll French toast. Stop and shop: Most of Ojai's galleries and boutiques are located in and around the main street shopping arcade (see Where to Shop). If your tastes veer more to the homegrown variety (artisanal soaps, candles, honey and breads), time your visit to coincide with Ojai's Certified Farmers' Market (300 E. Matilija St.), held on Sundays. Get cooking: Nancy Michali trained at San Francisco's renowned Tanta Marie culinary school before opening the Ojai Culinary Studio (315 N. Montgomery St.; 805/646-1124; classes from $30) in a wood-floored house. The assortment of international cooking classes features ingredients from the on-site garden. DAY 3 . Find your spiritual side: Pilgrims, gurus and yogis have been drawn to these chaparral-covered hills for years. To see why, follow Reeves Road to the serene Meditation Mount (10340 Reeves Rd.; 805/646-5508), where rock platforms seem suspended over the valley. Sweat it out: The 31,000-square-foot spa at the Ojai Valley Inn & Spa is the only one in the country to offer Kuyam -- a Moroccan mud treatment and guided meditation. More traditional treatments include several facials that use the inn's natural skin-care line. Treat yourself: Small plates (tomato-and-basil-stuffed artichokes; smoked salmon on baguette) make up the menu at Azu (457 E. Ojai Ave.; 805/640-7987; dinner for two $50), a diminutive tapas bar inspired by chef Laurel Moore's travels in Spain. With more than 60 wines, 20 vodkas and six beers on tap, it's also the perfect place to round out the night -- and your visit.  E-mail to a friend . Planning a beach getaway?

"The U.S. Department of Agriculture's Office of Inspector General has 85 shiny new submachine guns, locked and loaded. They've long had a small police force, and they're not alone, thanks to a mostly forgotten provision in the behemoth 2002 Homeland Security Act that allows certain the Offices of Inspector General to equip themselves with agents who carry guns. Criminal investigators at agencies like the USDA, the Small Business Administration and NASA can carry firearms. The USDA first gained the permanent ability to arm its criminal investigators in 1981. Twenty-five other federal agencies gained that permanent ability in 2002 as result of the Security Act. At 73 federal agencies and departments, independent sub-agencies called the Offices of the Inspector General, or OIGs, conduct oversight, perform audits and enforce laws. It is that last function that led the USDA to order the .40-caliber ""submachine guns"" in May. A spokesman for USDA OIG told CNN that these ""semi-automatic"" weapons were acquired on September 9, 2014. The Department of Education's OIG put out a similar purchase order in 2010 for 27 shotguns. Surprisingly, Congress does not know how many and what type of weapons the agencies have been stockpiling, according to Republican Rep. Chris Stewart of Utah. He wants a Governmental Accountability Office report on the issue and has introduced legislation this year to strip the OIGs of their guns. ""Americans don't see why dozens of federal agencies need their own highly armed police forces with the authority to raid homes and businesses,"" Stewart told CNN. So why do investigators at agencies better known for meat inspections and processing crop insurance claims need automatic weapons? ""Regarding the need for weapons' procurements, OIG's Investigations division conducts hundreds of criminal investigations each year, some of which involve OIG agents, USDA employees, and/or members of the public facing potentially life threatening situations,"" USDA Deputy Counsel Paul Feeney said. While the USDA has long had gun carrying agents, many other agencies did not have those law enforcement powers prior to a 2002 law meant to correct for the poor law enforcement coordination prior to September 11. One of the changes was section 812 that turned these additional Inspector General offices into permanent law enforcement agencies. Prior to that, some of the Inspectors General had to ask for special permission -- citing specific need to carry firearms -- from the U.S. Attorney General. These were granted on an ad hoc basis and almost universally, but they had to be renewed. The 2002 Homeland Security Act codified these law enforcement powers and the right for agents of the Inspectors General to carry firearms. The agencies efforts to stock weapons and ammunition caught the eye of curious lawmakers in 2013 when the House Oversight Committee held a subcommittee hearing. The hearing revealed that the Social Security Administration has 290 investigators who carry firearms, but for the past two decades, those agents have only fired their guns twice in the line of duty. But agencies are getting some use of their police gear. Last year, the EPA launched a criminal investigation into an Alaskan gold mine for potential violations of the Clean Water Act. They sent 10 officers (five from the EPA who carried shotguns) in bulletproof vests, according to a review of the incident by the state of Alaska. No charges have been levied. In 2011, the FDA conducted armed raids of an Amish farm searching for raw-milk related infractions. In justifying the need for Social Security's audit arm to carry guns, SSA's Inspector General Patrick O'Carroll cited a standoff with a murder suspect. But O'Carroll acknowledged Kentucky State Police accompanied Social Security's agents in that pursuit. Rep. Stewart thinks that law enforcement-specific agencies should take the lead, not regulators. ""When there are genuinely dangerous situations involving federal law, that's the job of the Department of Justice, not regulatory agencies like the FDA or the Department of Education,"" Stewart said. Pete Kennedy, president of the Farm-to-Consumer Legal Defense Fund, whose members have been raided by the FDA, said agents have even pointed their guns at unarmed food producers suspected of permit violations. ""These people don't need their own enforcement teams."" ""They have the U.S. Marshals at their disposal, if there really is a problem,"" Kennedy told CNN. USDA's Inspector General office confirmed to CNN that the majority enforcement actions -- arrest and search warrants -- are done in conjunction with another federal, state or other law enforcement agency. According to a 2012 report by the Department of Justice's statistics arm, there were over 3500 gun-wielding agents assigned to the various Offices of Inspector General as of 2008, including 52 at NASA, 34 at the Small Business Administration, six at the National Science Foundation, and 28 at the Office of Personnel Management, the federal government's HR wing.","Certain civilian agencies employ armed investigators .

"The U.N. Security Council voted unanimously Friday in favor of a resolution to condemn violence in Yemen, where demonstrators, government forces and rival factions have been embroiled in months of unrest. The 15-0 vote demands that Yemen allow peaceful demonstrations to take place and to end government crackdowns on civilians. U.S. Ambassador Susan E. Rice said the ""Security Council sent a strong message to President (Ali Abdullah) Saleh that it is time to heed the legitimate calls of the Yemeni people for a peaceful and orderly transition toward a unified, stable, secure and democratic Yemen."" ""President Saleh has repeatedly pledged to sign the (Gulf Cooperation Council) initiative,"" Rice said. ""Today, the Security Council made clear to President Saleh that his continued equivocation is weakening his country and imperiling a peaceful and democratic future for the people of Yemen. Friday's resolution does not, however, sanction the embattled leader. The proposed deal, which Rice noted, referenced a GCC-brokered accord, backed by the United States and  European Union, whereby Saleh could resign from power in exchange for immunity from prosecution. Peter Wittig, German ambassador to the United Nations, said the resolution was ""not ideal"" but ""can make a difference."" ""We would have liked to express those messages that are in that resolution even in a stronger and more unequivocal form, especially the strong call to President Saleh to step down,"" he said. Nobel Peace Prize winner Tawakkol Karman also weighed in Friday, calling the resolution ""not sufficient."" ""They have to discuss about the ousting of Ali Saleh and that he has to be handed over to the authorities immediately,"" says the Yemeni activist who plans to stay in the United States ""until I am able to submit Ali Saleh's case to the international tribunal."" ""But in general,"" she said of the resolution, ""I would say it is good."" U.N. director at Human Rights Watch Philippe Bolopio said the group welcome's ""the long overdue condemnation of Yemeni government abuses,"" but Bolopio believes ""the Security Council should have more clearly distanced itself from the GCC impunity deal."" Earlier this week, several people were killed during clashes with Yemeni security forces after anti-government protests filled the streets of the country's capital. Crowds had marched through downtown Sanaa, where government forces allegedly gunned down protesters. Hundreds of security forces attempted to restrict the protesters' movements, and tear-gas canisters could be seen flying toward the crowd, said hospital director Mohammed Qubati. A senior U.S. official, speaking on condition on anonymity, said that Friday's resolution, introduced by Germany and the United Kingdom, would send a strong signal of urgency for political transition. The official said that unanimity is an indication of greater consensus on the council. Russia and China issued a rare double veto of a resolution condemning the violence in Syria this month. Security Council members have said a political solution in Yemen should be based on a initiative put forward by the GCC, a political and economic union of Arab states.","U.S. Ambassador Susan E.

"(CNN) -- A Delaware pediatrician has been indicted on 471 felony counts in the alleged sexual abuse of his patients, prosecutors announced Monday. The Sussex County grand jury indictment accuses Dr. Earl Bradley, 56, who has had a practice in Lewes, Delaware, for more than 10 years, of victimizing 103 children -- all but one girls. The charges range from rape and sexual exploitation of a child to endangering child welfare and assault. Delaware Attorney General Beau Biden told CNN Radio the indictment is based on ""video and digital evidence"" seized from Bradley's home and medical practice in December. Authorities have not ruled out additional charges, he added. ""The reality is that as a prosecutor, the rules prohibit me from telling you exactly how I feel -- and I'm feeling a great deal today,"" Biden said. Bradley also has medical licenses in Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Florida. Authorities have said they have contacted officials in those states. He was initially arrested and charged in December. Bradley's attorney, Eugene Maurer Jr., said he would base his client's defense on mental health. ""Most of the evidence in this case comes from videotapes -- it's kind of hard to argue with videotapes,"" Maurer said, adding, ""The issue in this case is going to come down to his mental health at the time."" Biden said Bradley will be arraigned within four to six weeks.","Dr. Earl Bradley faces 471 counts in the alleged abuse of 103 children .

"A Florida A&M University drum major who died after enduring a school hazing ritual aboard a bus decided to go through with the rite in order to earn respect, band members said in court documents released Wednesday. ""It's like a respect thing,"" said defendant Jonathan Boyce, who noted that Robert Champion ""was wanting to do it all season."" Champion, 26, died last year because of ""hemorrhagic shock due to soft tissue hemorrhage, due to blunt force trauma,"" the Orange County medical examiner said. More than 2,000 pages of police interviews with witnesses and defendants who were aboard the bus on the day of Champion's death paint a picture of a darkened bus where three band members, including Champion, were hazed. Multiple witnesses say that Champion was forced to walk, shirtless, from the front of the bus to the back while being beaten with drum sticks, bass drum mallets, punches and kicks. Champion is thought to have died after taking part in a rite of passage called ""Crossing Bus C,"" in which students ""walk from the front of the bus to the back of the bus backward while the bus is full of other band members."" Florida A&M band fraternity charter revoked after hazing investigation . ""You get beaten until you get to the back,"" one band member said on the condition of anonymity. But Champion's parents said Wednesday that their son had advocated against hazing. ""It doesn't sound like my son at all,"" Pam Champion told reporters at a news conference in Atlanta. ""He was a stickler for the rules."" Boyce and other defendants are only trying to ""save themselves,"" she said, by claiming that Champion wanted to participate in the ritual. ""It certainly wasn't (just) hazing,"" she added, describing the incident as a ""brutal assault."" As for the future of FAMU's Marching 100, Pam Champion said, ""Until you clean house, you can't ... consider putting that band back on the field."" After the incident, Boyce said he asked Champion if he was alright. Initially, he said ""yeah I'm OK,"" according to Boyce. But later, he said Champion began panicking. ""He was having trouble breathing,"" noted Boyce, who carried the drum major shortly before he lost consciousness. ""He couldn't see, but his eyes were like wide open."" Boyce's attorney could not be immediately reached for comment and CNN cannot independently verify his account. Band member Harold Finley, who has been charged in connection with Champion's death, and Evan Calhoun, then a second-year percussion student who has not been charged, noted that the hazing ritual wasn't obligatory. ""If you want to be there, you're there; if you're not, you're not,"" Calhoun said in the deposition. ""Nobody forces you."" Band member Kerian Cox, who was a percussion section leader, told investigators that the more intense hazing can come when a student is identified for senior-level positions. ""I guess they know I was going to be like a (band) leader in the future,"" Cox said, recalling his own earlier experience with the ritual. But he noted that the band's trombone section had been ""cut in half"" due to suspensions for alleged hazing prior to the November incident. On the day that Champion died, drum major Keon Hollis told investigators, he had endured the same ritual. ""I did it for the same reasons everybody else do it,"" he said. ""Get the respect."" Hollis -- who went before Champion -- said they had to fight their way through a fury of punches and slaps, while other band members swung with sticks and straps. ""(Robert) really didn't want to do it, but he was kind of like, I'm just going to do it,"" said Hollis. ""You know, I told him, I said, if you don't want to do it, don't do it."" Hollis said Champion seemed fine immediately after the ritual. ""He was fine. ... He asked me, he's like, 'man, I need something to drink.' And I had a bottle of water and I gave it to him,"" Hollis said in an audio interview with investigators released Wednesday. Soon afterward, Champion began having trouble breathing, according to witnesses and police reports. ""He was sitting on the bus at the steps. ... He said he can't breathe, so I checked him,"" said band member Darryl Cearnel, who is not charged in the case. ""He wasn't saying anything. He wasn't responsive or anything. They was calling his name and (he) wasn't saying anything."" Cearnel told investigators that he performed CPR until paramedics arrived. The medical examiner who conducted the autopsy ruled the death a homicide. The autopsy found ""extensive contusions of (Champion's) chest, arms, shoulder and back,"" as well as ""evidence of crushing of areas of subcutaneous fat,"" the fatty tissue directly under the skin. He did not have any bone fractures or injuries to his internal organs. There was also no any evidence of ""natural disease except for a slightly enlarged heart,"" nor did toxicology tests reveal signs of drugs or alcohol. Four students were expelled from the school, and another 30 were dismissed from the band soon after Champion's death. Florida files charges in death of FAMU drum major, hazing of 2 others . A law enforcement investigation resulted in charges being brought against 13 people. Eleven individuals each face one count of third-degree felony hazing resulting in death. Each one also is accused of two counts of first-degree misdemeanor hazing. State law provides a prison term of up to six years for those facing the more serious charges. Two people each face a single count of misdemeanor first-degree hazing. Sentences in such cases typically call for up to a year in jail. Champion's death brought renewed public scrutiny to hazing, a practice that some say has gone on for years. Other band members had come forward previously with allegations of hazing and some had been hospitalized for injuries allegedly suffered in the practice. FAMU said it has taken steps to eradicate the problem, and after Champion died the university's board of trustees approved an anti-hazing plan that includes an independent panel of experts to investigate hazing allegations.","Witnesses claim Robert Champion was forced to walk shirtless while he was beaten on the bus .

"San Francisco (CNN) -- Sunday's debut of the Nintendo 3DS, a hand-held game system with a 3-D display that doesn't require special glasses, isn't just the culmination of several years of research and development for one product. It could be a milestone for a company that's spent decades refining three-dimensional technology, only to be met with resistance from consumers. Playing games in 3-D ""is something that we've been continually testing and working on at Nintendo,"" said Hideki Konno, who has directed or produced some of Nintendo's most prized franchises and was a key person in the 3DS's development, through an interpreter. ""We've never actually stopped looking at 3-D as a viable product,"" Konno said. ""And it just so happens that the technology in the marketplace now coincides with what we wanted to do. So actually, it was just very fortuitous timing."" Nintendo projects that it will sell 4 million 3DS units this month, and many analysts agree. The system was released in Japan last month and in parts of Europe on Friday. Nintendo sold 47 million units of the DS line of systems, which all have two screens, with one being a touchscreen. Even before the U.S. launch, the 3DS is off to the most promising start of any game system in at least a decade, according to pre-sale observations from Amazon.com. Without a doubt, it's Nintendo's strongest foray into the third dimension. And there have been many. The first commercially available 3-D product from Nintendo came in the 1980s. The Kyoto, Japan, company manufactured 3-D goggles and a companion disc player that could be connected to the Family Computer, called the Nintendo Entertainment System in the U.S. The project flopped and never made its way outside Japan. Then in 1995, Nintendo tried again with the Virtual Boy. Players would peer through stationary goggles and manipulate monochromatic red characters that popped out from the screen using a wired controller. The system was designed by the team that thought up the Game Boy, but the machine was barely portable. It had a battery, but imagine setting up this ridiculous hunk of plastic to play on the train, said Konno, who can joke about the defeat now. The Virtual Boy disappeared from shelves less than a year after appearing in stores. ""When we launched Virtual Boy, we thought it would work,"" Konno said. ""It's trial and error. We made mistakes. And we build on mistakes."" Despite failures, Nintendo's trials continued -- but in secret so that errors weren't subjected to public humiliation. For example, Nintendo internally developed hardware that would allow players to enable 3-D on the GameCube, which was the home console that preceded the Wii. That project never made it out of the laboratory. ""It would have required consumers to buy a special LCD screen to attach to the GameCube to actually play,"" Konno recalled. ""We didn't think it was worth that investment for consumers, so it never came out."" Nintendo has taken a string of commercial risks in the past decade, racking up an impressive track record. The company released a touchscreen gadget called the DS in 2004, three years before Apple would ignite the mobile market with the iPhone. In 2006, the Wii became an instant hit, and competitors in the game-console industry scrambled to make motion-detection systems of their own. Now, 15 years since the company's last 3-D system vanished from stores, Nintendo's next bet is on an old horse that has never made it far out of the stable. Fortunately for Nintendo, the technology has a number of high-profile backers, including Hollywood. Users will be able to purchase 3-D movies to watch on the device's 3.5-inch screen -- larger than most previous DS systems and about the size of the iPhone's -- or stream video from Netflix. ""This is an entertainment device; make no mistake,"" Nintendo of America President Reggie Fils-Aime said. ""It's not purely a gaming device."" In addition to entertainment features, the 3DS has a pedometer to appeal to the health-conscious crowd that the Wii Fit tapped, as well as a variety of internet and wireless communication applications. Nintendo also plans to add a Web browser. A pair of cameras on the back can snap 3-D pictures, and Nintendo hints that 3-D video recording may come. But above all, what Nintendo has learned from its research over the past few decades -- and what television makers and rival game companies like Sony Computer Entertainment are learning -- is that 3-D plus glasses is a losing formula, Nintendo executives said. ""I think at Nintendo, we realize that any sort of goggle-type 3-D technology was not going to work,"" Konno said. ""In order to make 3-D technology viable with video games, we thought we needed to have glasses-free 3-D."" Nintendo's aversion to glasses could also rule out 3-D coming to its home console systems. On television screens, 3-D is difficult to achieve without glasses because people watch from many different angles. ""Glasses-free is a big deal,"" Fils-Aime said. ""We've not said publicly what the next thing for us will be in the home console space, but based on what we've learned on 3-D, likely, that won't be it.""","Nintendo has spent decades developing 3-D technologies .
That work culminates with the 3DS, a glasses-free 3-D game system that launches Sunday .
But the 3DS comes after a string of failures for Nintendo in the 3-D space ."
"(CNN) -- You've built a cannon. Now you just need a willing participant to crawl inside. Robin Valencia's uncle always seemed like a bit of ""a mad scientist."" And growing up next door to him in Salem, Oregon, she didn't think much of the fact he was building a giant cannon in his basement. That was just David Smith, a math teacher and trained gymnast who was so fascinated by circus cannons, he went ahead and made one. Then he fired himself, his two children, and his niece out of it. It was the beginnings of one of the world's most remarkable human cannonball families. Smith Snr is celebrated for such spectacular stunts as being fired over the Mexican border. While son David Smith Jr holds the world record for the highest shot in the air, a whopping 26 meters. Cannonball couple . But the cannon is more than simply an unusual career choice for niece Valencia, who today goes by the stage name ""Shooting Star."" It's how she met her husband Chachi Valencia, better known as ""The Rocketman"" who blasted into the sky at the London 2012 Olympic closing ceremony. For over two decades the cannonball couple, now in their 40s, have traveled the globe shooting each other into the blue yonder. It's a nomadic lifestyle, and they currently live in Paris with their two daughters, working with the Finnish State Circus. Where they could be called to perform next, is anyone's guess. But Chachi is used to the giddy heights -- he is the fifth generation of a flying trapeze family from Chile. That's how he met Robin. ""He was a trapeze artist in the same circus show as my cousin,"" she explained. ""We fell in love and wanted to do something on our own."" That special something was cannonballing, and the loved-up teenagers enlisted the help of Smith Snr to build them a five-meter-long aluminum and stainless steel cannon, which Robin still uses to this day. Force of nature . Seeing Robin flying through the air in her luminous catsuit, red helmet gleaming like a candy Jaffa, she appears like a retro superhero zooming 12 meters above the gasping crowd below. Yet even after all these years she still finds the experience nerve wracking. Why does she do it? ""The actual flight, free flying through the air with nothing attached to you, is amazing,"" she says. There's no denying it's an awesome spectacle. But not one without serious injuries and fatalities, including a man who died in the UK in 2011 when his safety net collapsed. Before Robin slides down the barrel, there are landing calculations to be done, and sand-filled dummies to be test launched. ""People don't realize how much time it takes preparing, taking into consideration things like the weather, the humidity, temperature, wind, and doing your math formulas correctly,"" said Robin, who must land flat on her back in the middle of a giant air-filled target. ""I use an airbag, so I have an electric fan that fills it with air. That means the electricity has to be very safe and secure and no one can unplug it -- which has happened to me before."" Luckily for Robin, someone plugged in the fan again just in time. Staring down the barrel . Showmanship is a huge part of the performance, and seeing Robin work the crowd before the big bang, is a bit like witnessing the dramatic entrance of a wrestler before a fight. But after she slides down the darkened barrel, just what goes on inside? ""You have to make sure that you have every muscle tight, and your neck and spine aligned,"" she explained. ""You have to be completely up against the mechanism that fires you through the air -- because if you're away from it, or not ready, or your body is loose, then it would be like being hit by a semi truck."" The shorter the barrel, the more violent the impact, meaning Robin tends to take more of a blow than Chachi in his 10-meter-long cannon. ""You could never in your wildest dreams imagine the kind of impact it takes to fire you out of a cannon,"" she says. ""It's instant. Your take-off is in the blink of an eye. You go from nothing to 80 kilometers per hour."" Trade secret . When it comes to explaining how the cannon works though, Robin is less forthcoming. ""It's a trade secret,"" she said. ""It's not just our family, but all human cannonballs are pretty secretive."" That said, the only gunpowder you're likely to find in modern cannons is in creating the bang and puff of smoke. Instead, compressed air or a bungee cord are used to propel a small platform -- which launches the performer sky high. But the gasp-inducing performance seems to have lost none of its magic, with audience members telling Robin after the show: ""It was the best six seconds of my life."" Does that mean she and Chachi will be encouraging their children to also enter the trade? ""No, I don't think so,"" she says with a nervous laugh. ""I'd like them to remember their cannonball parents -- but that doesn't mean I want them to be ones themselves."" Inspire: For $150k you could be Buzz Lightyear .

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- The death toll climbed higher Tuesday in Georgia as dry skies over much of metropolitan Atlanta stopped advancing floods. Floodwater surrounds homes near Atlanta on Tuesday. At least eight people have died in the state from the flooding, and one person is missing and presumed dead in Chattanooga, Tennessee. To the west of Atlanta, Douglas County was particularly hard hit with six people confirmed dead. The latest victim was a young adult male found dead in the northwest of the county, said Wes Tallon,  county spokesman for the emergency management agency. The death was an ""obvious flash flood death,"" Tallon said, adding that the body was found with a vehicle downstream from a roadway.  See photos of flooding » . Parts of northwest and south central Georgia, as well as the metro Atlanta area, were still under a flash flood watch Tuesday night. Standing water remained throughout parts of Atlanta. But CNN meteorologists said the heavier rain had shifted west of the hardest hit areas in Georgia. They expected significant rain in parts of Mississippi and Louisiana, where the ground was saturated by the earlier storms that moved up from the Gulf of Mexico to cover the southeast. But slow draining waters Tuesday left portions of highways I-285 and I-20 on the city's west side still closed Tuesday night, and several state roads in the area were closed because of flooding, or bridges and roadways washed away.  Watch interstate under water » . Georgia Gov. Sonny Perdue pleaded Tuesday with residents to stay off roads, noting that nearly all the fatalities so far were drivers and passengers swept away by the floodwater. ""Stuff is important but it's not nearly as important as your life,"" he said. ""Please give these waters time to recede."" Perdue said he planned to ask President Obama to declare a federal emergency in Georgia. The governor has declared states of emergency in 17 flood-stricken counties. Until just a few months ago, the area was gripped by drought. Schools in the Atlanta metro area were closed Tuesday as some isolated storms soaked areas around the city. The rains were not as widespread or heavy as they were Monday.  Watch flooding in Atlanta's urban core » . In Douglas County, some of the flooding victims spoke to family members while trapped inside their vehicles. ""She said that the vehicle was being taken by water, that it was starting to take the car,"" said Lori Jones, whose niece, Delena Waters, died in the flooding. She spoke to CNN affiliate WSB-TV. ""The last thing they heard was that she was floating away."" Another victim's relative had a similar story: . ""His girlfriend was talking to him at 12:30 last night, he said, 'I'm on Pool Mill Road, water's flooding in my car, I cannot get it open,'"" the relative told WSB-TV. ""He said 'I gotta call 911' and then his phone went dead."" Emergency management spokesman Tallon also reported an adult woman found dead downstream from a car that had washed off the roadway.  Watch what caused such torrential rain » . One group in the county was more fortunate. County emergency director Jason Milhollin told CNN that a car was swept off the road during the morning commute, and four other people who tried to rescue the driver were also swept away. All five were later rescued, he said. ""They were fine, no one went to the hospital,"" Milhollin said. ""Luckily they had a fence to hold on to and we got the boat to them."" Elsewhere, a 2-year-old boy and a 39-year old woman were killed. The toddler died when he was ripped from his father's arms by fast-moving floodwater as the father struggled to hold onto bushes, officials in Carroll County, also west of Atlanta, said. Seydi Burciaga, 39, was swept off a road in Lawrenceville in Gwinnett County, east of Atlanta, when flash flooding trapped her in her vehicle, Gwinnett County police said. She called 911 and police tried to locate her, but Burciaga could not tell them exactly where she was. Floodwater moved her minivan about 500 feet after she was swept off the roadway, and her attempts to guide rescuers by mentioning landmarks were unsuccessful, police said. By the time rescuers found the minivan, she was dead. Some areas west of Atlanta have received more than 22 inches of rain since last week, nearly half of that falling from Sunday night to Monday morning. After Georgia creeks and rivers burst, swollen by days of rain, residents struggled to escape. iReport.com: Horses pulled to safety from flooded creek . An additional death was reported likely in Tennessee, where a presumed drowning victim was forced into a culvert, or underground storm water drain, Sunday evening, Chattanooga Fire Department spokesman Bruce Garner said. Sylvester Kitchens Jr., 46, was with friend Albert Miller when they decided to swim in a large, flooded ditch, Garner said. He said a Miller family member told him that ""basically, it was a bet."" Both managed to grab a chain-link fence while being buffeted by the strong current, Garner said. A neighbor threw a garden hose for them to grab, and Kitchens reached for it but couldn't hold on. Miller clung to the fence for about 20 minutes and was eventually rescued by firefighters, Garner said. Kitchens' body has not been found, said Garner, who added that it ""doesn't appear he could've survived.""

"Just months after President Obama was described by his own advisers as a ""bear"" on the loose, there are few midterm sightings of the man once dubbed the ""campaigner in chief"" by his Republican adversaries. The President has spent much of the 2014 cycle behind closed doors, either cloistered inside the White House cocoon dealing with a seemingly endless series of crises and scandals, or at private fundraisers, urging donors to write checks to top Democratic Party campaign and political action committees. Tough road for Democrats to keep the Senate . That political calendar will evolve somewhat as Election Day draws near, a White House official told CNN. For starters, the President will appear at events with Democratic candidates in the coming weeks, the official said. Obama will make the argument for policies aimed at middle class voters, just as he did in last week's speech on the economy in Chicago. ""The President has already succeeded in making a pretty aggressive case about why that's important for the country, and I would anticipate that in the context of the upcoming elections you'll hear the President make that case again,"" White House press secretary Josh Earnest said. Carter criticizes Obama on ISIS: 'We waited too long' Even though the White House is not quite ready to announce Obama's upcoming campaign stops, there are a few states that can be crossed off the map. Races in Louisiana, Arkansas, Alaska, where incumbent Democratic senators face uphill battles to win reelection, remain at the top of the Obama no-go list. ""There are definitely deeply red states in play this cycle where it won't make sense to send the President,"" a White House official said. Democratic senator can't judge Obama's Ebola handling . So far, Obama is also avoiding crucial Senate races in states where he won decisive victories in the past.  The White House has yet to signal any plans to send the President to Iowa, a critical battleground he captured twice: in 2008 and 2012. Instead, first lady Michelle Obama will travel to Iowa Friday to appear with Democratic congressman Bruce Braley, who remains locked in a close race with state Sen. Joni Ernst for the seat vacated by liberal stalwart Tom Harkin. ""We defer to the campaigns who know their states best how to win,"" a White House official said. Can lame ducks fly? Advice for Obama on his last two years . Another sign of Obama's drag on his party's midterm hopes can be found in North Carolina, a critical Obama victory in 2008 that he and his party failed to translate into a more lasting Democratic incursion into southern red states in the years that followed. Despite North Carolina's potentially strong base of Democratic support from African-Americans and countless college-aged voters, Obama has become a major obstacle for the state's endangered incumbent Sen. Kay Hagan. Her opponent, state House Speaker Tom Tillis, repeatedly tried to link Hagan to the President during a debate Tuesday in the state's prosperous Research Triangle area. ""I think it's fair to make this election about his policies,"" Tillis said in the debate. Bill Clinton plays savior for Arkansas Democrats . That remark was a reminder of a comment made by Obama at a speech on the economy last week in Chicago: ""These policies are on the ballot -- every single one of them,"" the President said.  His long-time adviser, David Axelrod, called that part of the speech a ""mistake."" Michael Steel, a spokesman for U.S. House Speaker John Boehner and a midterm strategist for the North Carolina Republican Party, described the Obama factor as ""huge"" in Tuesday's debate. ""Her worst moments in the debate were when she refused to distance herself from the President,"" Steel said of Hagan. Poll: In North Carolina Senate race, libertarian could be spoiler . A key Democratic Party operative, who asked to speak on condition of anonymity, said inserting Obama into crucial campaign contests carries some risk.  Not only does the President's unpopularity drive up enthusiasm among conservatives, the strategist said. It may encourage some moderate Democrats to stay home. ""Even Obama supporters, they're disappointed in him,"" the strategist said. ""We can't find a way to motivate them."" The first lady, Vice President Joe Biden, and Bill and Hillary Clinton are seen as better alternatives. Will same-sex marriage become a 2014 issue? Even though Biden has spent the last several days calling leaders in the Middle East to clarify his comments that appeared to suggest Arab nations were partly responsible for the rise of ISIS, the vice president appears to be in demand among Democrats. ""So what if he f***ed up?"" one Democratic strategist said, noting the party's base is attracted to the vice president's ""Uncle Joe"" shoot-from-the-lip style.  Biden just wrapped up an event on Tuesday with Amanda Renteria, a congressional candidate in California. He is scheduled to appear with Democratic Sen. Jeff Merkley of Oregon on Wednesday. Six times Joe Biden aimed for the truth and caused a headache . The one campaign setting where the president appears to thrive are fundraisers.  A White House official provided a list of approximately 50 fundraisers where Obama has spoken to Democratic donors this year.  His events this week in New York, Connecticut, Washington and Chicago generated between $2-3 million, Democratic sources said.","President Obama is set to hit the trail for Democratic candidates .

"Deliberations resume Monday in Philadelphia in the landmark trial of Monsignor William Lynn, the highest-ranking cleric charged with endangering children by allegedly helping cover up sexual abuse. Lynn, a defendant with another Philadelphia priest, is accused of knowingly allowing dangerous priests to continue in the ministry in roles in which they had access to children. Also on trial is the Rev. James Brennan, who is accused of the attempted rape of a 14-year-old. Both Brennan and Lynn have pleaded not guilty. Closing arguments in the case concluded Thursday and jurors began their deliberations Friday. Philadelphia priest abuse trial a test case for Catholic church . Lynn's defense team argues that the monsignor repeatedly sent word of child sex abuse up the chain of command. He operated under strict orders from the late Archbishop Cardinal Anthony Bevilacqua and never had the power to remove a priest from ministry, the defense team argues. It said Lynn was never formally trained to handle child sex abuse allegations and learned on the job. ""The allegation is that he did nothing, but he didn't do nothing,"" said Thomas Bergstrom, Lynn's defense attorney . ""They want you to convict him for their sins. He held more than a candle to their shame, he put a spotlight on their shame,"" Bergstrom told jurors. Lynn donned his clerical garb, surrounded by numerous family members, priest friends and parishioners inside the courtroom. Lynn is the first high-ranking church figure charged with child endangerment for allegedly shuffling predator priests from parish to parish. If convicted, he faces up to 21 years in prison. Now-defrocked priest Edward Avery was due to go on trial with Brennan and Lynn, but he pleaded guilty in March after admitting to sexually assaulting a 10-year-old altar boy during the 1998-1999 school year. Avery, 69, was sentenced to two-and-a-half to five years in prison. More than 60 witnesses and alleged victims of clergy abuse have testified since the criminal trial began March 26. Accusers for Brennan and Avery have claims that fall within the statute of limitations. Brennan's accuser, now in his 30s, was a former altar boy who cried on the stand weeks earlier as he described the incident. The man, a former Marine, was discharged because of mental health issues. ""He will say anything at all to get what he wants,"" Brennan's attorney, William Brennan, no relation to the defendant, told jurors about the accuser. ""Plug that into your credibility meter."" Brennan was removed from active ministry in 2006 after his accuser first came forward. He admitted in 2008 that he allowed the then-14-year-old to view pornography and sleep in the same bed with him during an overnight visit in 1996, according to testimony given to church investigators. Brennan did not testify at the trial. His attorney urged jurors to use their ""common sense"" once they began deliberations. ""It's a mistake; it's poor judgment,"" Brennan told jurors of the sleepover. ""I can't believe a jury would destroy this man's life over that."" A 2011 grand jury report led the Philadelphia district attorney's office to criminally charge four Philadelphia priests and a parochial school teacher with raping and assaulting boys in their care, while Lynn was accused of allowing the abusive priests to have access to children. The trial marks the first time U.S. prosecutors have charged not just the priests who allegedly committed the abuses, but an official -- Lynn -- who stands accused of failing to stop the assaults. A gag order bars all parties involved in the criminal case from talking to the media.","William Lynn is the highest-ranking cleric to be charged with child endangerment .

"In 2012, photographer Matika Wilbur sold everything in her Seattle apartment and hit the road on a cross-country journey. Her goal? To photograph individuals from each of the 562 federally recognized Native American tribes in the United States and memorialize their stories. Since then, the number of federally recognized tribes has risen to 566, and Wilbur is still crisscrossing the country, immersing herself in the worlds of Native Americans from Brooklyn to the far reaches of Alaska for her ongoing photo series, Project 562. ""Stereotypes in the media reduce Indian country to the Plains Indian in a headdress,"" said scholar Adrienne Keene, a member of the Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma whom Wilbur photographed for the series. ""(Project 562) gives people an opportunity to see the diversity in Indian country and reframe what they think of when they think of Native Americans."" A selection of photos from Project 562 is on display at the Tacoma Art Museum in Washington through October 5, with audio from Wilbur's conversations with her subjects. Fans of the series say its timing could not be better. With mainstream America showing more support for efforts to end appropriation of Native American imagery in sports and fashion, they say Project 562 provides positive examples to fill the void. ""Having these counter-narratives and counter-representations to the stereotypes and negative portrayals we see in the media every day is really important for helping people understand contemporary Native Americans,"" said Keene. The project is also building relationships in Indian country, cultivating bonds among Wilbur, the participants and also connecting them to elite institutions like the Tacoma Art Museum, Keene said. ""What she's doing is not just photographing. She's building relationships and bonds that are going to last far beyond the physical photographs."" Native American designers fight cultural caricatures . 'The project is for the people' Wilbur, whose first name means ""the messenger,"" said the images allow Americans to see a diverse representation of a group they rarely see and hear from. They also highlight positive role models in Indian country for the next generation. ""The project is for the people, not just native people but everyone,"" Wilbur said. ""I think that there are truths that remain untold and we can really learn a lot from one another. Hopefully it can inspire the next generation to seek that authenticity."" Questions around Native American identity are central to Project 562. Wilbur asks each person 15 questions about their family history, self-determination, sovereignty and the future. Then she asks her subjects how and where they would like to be photographed and takes their portrait. Some wear traditional regalia and pose in sites relevant to their tribe's history. Others stand on their porches in T-shirts and jeans, or on the roofs of buildings. Letting them decide is central to the project, Wilbur said. Participating in Project 562 was an opportunity for Keene to reflect on what being a ""contemporary Native American"" meant to her. Wilbur and Keene knew each other before Project 562 through their efforts in a larger movement in Indian country to change negative perceptions of Native Americans. Keene, a Harvard-educated post-doctoral researcher at Brown University focusing on Native access to higher education, deconstructs stereotypes of Native Americans on her blog, Native Appropriations. Like Keene, Wilbur left Indian country to pursue higher education and spent part of her career in fashion photography before turning her camera on indigenous communities in South America and the United States. Taking Native American fashion 'Beyond Buckskin' The two met in Keene's apartment in downtown Phoenix in January, when Keene was writing her dissertation as a predoctoral fellow at Arizona State University. Keene told Wilbur about how her Cherokee ancestors were forced from their ancestral lands in western North Carolina to Oklahoma. They lived in Oklahoma until they were displaced by the construction of a river. It was not until Keene was working on her dissertation at Harvard that she visited her ancestral land in North Carolina for the first time.  She said it was a powerful experience she'll never forget. ""We talked about how to me, being a real Cherokee means I can go to those places and feel a connection with the land and know my ancestors stood there thousands of years ago,"" she said. ""This is something that runs through me, and that connection makes me a real Cherokee person, being able to say that with full authority and full knowledge. I hadn't felt it until I was there."" Creating a legacy for Native youth . The concept of identity is fluid from person to person and generation to generation, Wilbur said. Some Native Americans lost their language and traditions through assimilation in American Indian boarding schools. Others are fighting for federal recognition of their tribes under the vast regulatory criteria of the U.S. Department of the Interior's Bureau of Indian Affairs. The project has  prompted her to ponder what being a Native American will mean for future generations. Code talker Chester Nez and the tragic history of native language . ""I've recently come to recognize that it really is about the actions, the way we choose to live our lives on a daily basis, is (what's) really going to control the outcome of what happens to our people,"" Wilbur explained. She has high hopes for Project 562's legacy. This year, a second Kickstarter campaign surpassed her $54,000 goal, to raise more than $213,000. She's using the money to continue traveling and plan the next iteration of Project 562 as books, websites, maybe even educational materials. ""The life we live is for the people,"" Wilbur said. ""That's what I was raised for, to find my gift and share it with the community.""","Matika Wilbur began touring the country in 2012 to photograph Native Americans .

"Last week, the Louisiana legislature passed a bill that could force all but two of the state's abortion providers to close their doors, which means Louisiana is preparing to join Texas, Alabama, Oklahoma, Louisiana and Mississippi to the list of Southern states on the verge of wiping out access to safe and legal abortion. Laws such as the one now headed to Gov. Bobby Jindal's desk appear to be part of a national strategy to subject doctors who provide abortion to medically unnecessary restrictions under the guise of improving patient safety despite the fact that abortion is already one of the safest medical procedures in the country. These laws have one real purpose: to make it almost impossible for a woman to get an abortion, no matter what circumstances she may be facing. Three years ago in Texas, there were 62 health centers that provided safe and legal abortion. Come this fall, as a result of harsh abortion restrictions, there could be as few as seven. That's seven health centers for 5.7 million women of reproductive age in a state roughly the size of France. When Gov. Rick Perry forced these restrictions through the legislature, he proudly announced that his goal was to make abortion ""a thing of the past."" The result? Texas is now experiencing a public health crisis. In addition to safe and legal abortion, many of these health centers also provided lifesaving preventive care to women with nowhere else to turn. With these restrictions, the United States is poised to become a country in which a woman's ability to make the private and personal medical decision best for herself and her family will be dependent upon where she happens to live. That's not supposed to happen in this country, and it cannot be what the Supreme Court intended when it established a woman's right to safe and legal abortion more than 40 years ago. Women in these states will tell you: When it comes to safe and legal abortion, there's a world of difference between a constitutional right and reality. For women in Montgomery and Birmingham who will have to travel anywhere from 200 to 400 miles round-trip to the nearest abortion provider in the state -- a trip existing law forces many of them to make twice -- and for women in New Orleans, who could find themselves 300 miles from the nearest provider, access to abortion becomes nearly impossible. How many women will be able to can take that much time off of work or afford to travel all day? They shouldn't have to. The only effective way to stop these attacks on women's health is to change who is in office passing these laws. Extreme politicians may not have reached their limit when it comes to grandstanding at the expense of women's health and safety but we women have already reached ours. It's a standoff that will continue through November. On the one side: a small group of politicians who want to take us back decades. On the other: doctors and medical experts; public officials who are champions of women's health; the majority of voters; and most of all, thousands of women, men, and young people across the country who are willing to fight tooth and nail to stop that from happening. In Missouri last week, volunteers of all ages from every part of the state braved rain to speak out for 72 hours straight against a harsh bill in the state Senate that would triple the waiting period for an abortion. Last summer in Texas, I met a whole new generation of activists who came back to the Capitol day after day to make their voices heard in support of access to abortion and who have kept on speaking long after new abortion restrictions were signed into law. And in New Orleans, clergy and business leaders have proudly stood with Planned Parenthood in support of women's health care. Even in the toughest states -- especially in the toughest states -- women and men have come roaring back. Politicians who are attacking women's health are on the wrong side of this issue. And women are not only watching, they're voting.","Cecile Richards: Louisiana latest state in South to pass bill limiting where women can get abortion .

"Actress Ashley Judd and champion race car driver Dario Franchitti are ending their marriage after more than 11 years. A representative for the actress confirmed the news Tuesday. Best known for movies such as ""Double Jeopardy"" and ""High Crimes,"" the actress attended Franchitti's races for years. She cheered from the sidelines, wearing floppy hats and cheery sun dresses. Shortly after the news broke, Judd  tweeted that the pair will remain ""family forever"" despite the divorce. ""Family forever,"" Franchitti tweeted her back. His tweet was later deleted, but still appeared in a log on his website. The star has said she did not know much about cars, but that changed when she met Franchitti. Hours before the divorce was announced, Judd responded to a Twitter question about her favorite sports car. She said her taste in cars mirrors  that of Franchitti. ""Especially the old Porsches and Ferraris,"" she tweeted. ""He has taught me about the art or the automobile."" The pair got married in his native Scotland in 2001. In addition to her movie roles, Judd served as a Tennessee delegate at the Democratic National Convention last year.  Her attendance sparked speculation that she may be considering a Senate run in her home state of Kentucky. She also advocates for humanitarian causes, and has traveled to nations such as Cambodia and Rwanda as part of her mission.

"(CNN)Barcelona took full advantage of arch-rival Real Madrid's humiliating derby defeat to close the gap in the La Liga title race to just one point with thrilling 5-2 win over Athletic Bilbao Sunday. Lionel Messi gave Barca the perfect start by grabbing his 33rd goal of the season and had a hand in his team's other four goals at the San Memes stadium. Messi's opener had a touch of fortune as it came from a deflected free-kick and he set up Luis Suarez for the Uruguay forward to double the advantage before halftime. Athletic refused to lie down and Mikel Rico pulled a goal back on the hour mark before Messi's goalbound header was then turned into his own net by Oscar de Marcos. The Catalan giants went 4-1 ahead when Neymar scored his 23rd of the season, Messi again with the assist. Aritz Aduriz pulled another goal back for Athletic but the home team's hopes ended when Xabier Etxeita was shown a straight red card for a nasty  challenge on Suarez before Pedro Rodriguez added a fifth. It was the ninth straight win for Barca, who will have taken heart from seeing Real thrashed 4-0 by reigning champions Atletico Madrid Saturday. Man Utd held . Barcelona's fellow European powerhouses Manchester United missed the opportunity to close up in the English Premier League title race when it was held 1-1 at West Ham. The home side looked set to secure all three points after a superb piece of skill from Senegal's Cheikhou Kouyate just after half time at Upton Park. He turned and volleyed home to put the Hammers ahead, but United kept battling and Daley Blind crashed home an equalizer in injury time. United's Luke Shaw was then sent off for a second yellow card and the draw leaves Louis van Gaal's team in fourth spot -- one point clear of Tottenham Hotspur, whose 2-1 win over Arsenal was the highlight of Saturday's program. In other EPL action, former England striker Peter Crouch scored a late equalizer as Stoke City drew 1-1 at Newcastle in a mid-table clash, while relegation battlers Burnley and West Bromwich Albion shared four goals. Roma closes gap . In Serie A, AS Roma closed the gap on leaders Juventus to seven points with a 2-1 win at Cagliari. It took a late winner from Leandro Paredes to give Rudi Garcia's men a first win after four league draws. Napoli consolidated third place with a  3-1 home win over Udinese, while Samuel Eto'o made his debut for Sampdoria off the bench but his new team was held 1-1 by Sassuolo to stay fifth.","Barcelona beats Athletic Bilbao 5-2 in La Liga clash .

"San Francisco, California (CNN) -- Stopping short of directly addressing intensifying speculation about a PlayStation phone, Sony's Peter Dille acknowledged that its portable game system could be due for a change soon. Dille, the senior vice president of marketing at Sony Computer Entertainment of America, was asked about the so-called PlayStation Phone, which was first reported by Engadget, in a fireside chat Wednesday at a conference in San Francisco. Refusing to confirm or deny rumors, Dille did say the lack of a cellular data connection could be holding back Sony's PlayStation Portable game system. ""The PSP is a Wi-Fi device,"" he said. ""People are used to having always-connected devices."" Sony's home game consoles have had life spans of 10 years each, and the PlayStation 3 will continue to be supported for at least that long, Dille said. But ""the portable market moves so fast,"" he said. At six years, the PSP may be looking dry. Indeed, Sony has had to reverse its marketing strategy to target younger gamers for that system, Dille said. Now, the PSP is having to compete with more fully featured hand-held game systems that can also make calls, send text messages and provide a window to thousands of games and apps. Apple chief Steve Jobs has boasted in news conferences, saying the iPod Touch and iPhone have become the hand-held gaming leaders. The company recently launched a social networking hub called Game Center. However, Dille said Sony has competitors, like Apple's iPhone and Google's Android, beat for the attention of serious gamers. PSP's focus is on long, immersive entertainment, not five-minute battles between meetings. ""These are largely time-killers,"" Dille said of smartphone games. ""Gamers aren't satisfied with that."" Whether Sony sees Android's gaming marketplace as a competitor or potential partner, Dille declined to comment. Engadget reported that Android could power the rumored PlayStation Phone. A spokeswoman present during a CNN interview with Dille after the onstage chat said, ""We have relationships with Google."" The PSP can already do more than just gaming, Dille said. It has applications for watching movies, making calls over Skype and limited Web browsing. But many of those functions are limited by whether you have Wi-Fi access. Plus, it's not a phone, so you need to carry multiple gadgets. But that could be a selling point, said Dille. ""Consumers like different boxes,"" he said. Sony's goal for the PlayStation Network -- the online component for gaming and downloading video of which Dille is also the senior vice president -- is to be an entertainment centerpiece and be always accessible. The current PSP doesn't quite fulfill that vision. ""I don't think we fully realize that vision with a Wi-Fi device,"" Dille told CNN. ""If it's not connected [to a cell network] then it does sort of limit people.""","A Sony executive declined to address rumors about the PlayStation Phone .
He indicated that the PlayStation Portable system could be due for a change .

"(CNN) -- ""A little more light!"" It's an early morning photo shoot for Glamour Magazine UK. There's a blizzard outside the window of Jack Studios in New York as the crew sets up in a flurry: Photographers meticulously adjust the lighting, makeup and hair artists arrange their bounty of brushes and stylists hang up racks upon racks of familiar names -- Ralph Lauren, DSquared2, Zac Posen, Helmut Lang, Agent Provocateur, Vivienne Westwood. They're all here for one person. ""Hi, I'm Carmen."" The woman in an unassuming black tank top, jeans, simple ponytail and hoop earrings (a staple she would later credit to growing up in New Jersey) introduces herself to the crew -- but everybody in the room already knows who she is. See all of CNN Living's New York Fashion Week coverage . ""People know me from a lot of places,"" she tells CNN later at her Perth Amboy, New Jersey, home. ""Google-dot-com Carmen Carrera!"" she laughs. Carrera first caught a glimpse of the spotlight on the third season of the cult favorite and gif-ready reality show ""RuPaul's Drag Race."" The day after she finished the show, she decided to begin her transition into the Carmen Carrera we know today -- a proud transgender fashion personality. Carrera says she has known since she was in kindergarten. She went to a Catholic school and had a crush on a fellow classmate, Anthony; she would get in trouble for running up to him and kissing him on the cheek every day. ""I knew that it wasn't me, as a boy having a crush on a boy. It was me, wanting to be a pretty girl, having a crush on a boy,"" she says. After a parent-teacher conference, she was transferred to a public school and put two and two together: She shouldn't express her femininity outside the home. ""My parents, thank God, never forced me to act any other kind of way but myself, so I was really lucky,"" she says. ""But when I was in school or outside the house, it was always an act, it was always a cover-up -- and I grew up with a lot of frustration."" At 18, she got her first car and left some of that frustration in the rearview mirror. She drove to New York and became immersed in the drag club scene, where she began to ""live freely and happily."" Then came ""Drag Race."" Since appearing on the show, Carrera has gained more than 66,000 followers on Twitter, 90,000 on Instagram and 215,000 on Facebook. Carrera became a part of the mainstream media conversation when she received more than 46,000 signatures on a Change.org petition to become Victoria's Secret's first transgender ""angel."" The petition gained a significant amount of traction only a few days before the 2013 fashion show was set to tape in November, but it was ultimately unsuccessful. (The company has not responded to the petition.) Victoria's Secret petitioned to hire first transgender model . Even so, she says, the support from fans has motivated her to try out for the over-the-top lingerie show in 2014. ""It's kind of like validation,"" she says. ""No matter how insecure I might be, no matter how un-pretty I might feel, there are people out there who look to me to be strong and to keep going and to keep proving people wrong."" Carrera's not the first transgender model -- and certainly not the last -- but in the fashion world, where cutting edge androgyny is often en vogue, the industry has been criticized for its sluggishness to embrace the transgender sector, different body shapes and diversity overall. Naomi Campbell, Iman call for an end to runway racism . There has been some progress. Legendary fashion photographer Bruce Weber captured 17 transgender models -- many of them nonprofessionals -- for luxury retailer Barneys New York's latest catalog and magazine campaign. High-profile transgender community members, such as actress Laverne Cox and writer Janet Mock, are also speaking more openly about their experiences navigating a world that can be ignorant and even hostile about these issues. What not to say to a transgender person . In an autobiographical essay in W Magazine, Carrera said: ""I want to leave something behind so people can look back one day and say, 'Wow, remember when transpeople were discriminated against the most? This person was like, Screw everybody! I'm going to parade around half-naked and be superproud, because that's how everyone should be!' "" Which leads her to today on set: She's represented by Elite Model Management, one of the world's leading model agencies. She's an unconventional choice, not only because of her gender: She's 28 amid a portfolio of girls in their late teens to early 20s, and she's admittedly a bit curvier than her runway counterparts. She's also a stepmother to her domestic partner's 9-year-old daughter. ""...Nor winter storm can't stop me baby,"" she mouths along to Diana Ross as the makeup artist finishes a decidedly fresh and natural look. Robin Page is the stylist coordinating the looks. While many designers sent pieces fit for Carrera's burlesque persona, Page went for more subdued offerings, like a Ralph Lauren pure white jumpsuit or a Dsquared2 A-line, knee-length skirt. ""I wanted you to be able to see her spirit, and her face and her eyes, as opposed to just body, just big hair, just tons of makeup,"" she says. ""We wanted to kind of make everything very sparse and very simple, just to get the essence of her."" ""Wow, I look like a grown-up,"" Carrera says. ""I'm used to wearing so much more makeup."" For the next six hours, Carrera will pose for frame after frame, every now and then stopping to change outfits and loosen up her facial muscles after holding a pose. There's a mirror behind the photographer that she occasionally glances in to try out a new pose, almost in awe of what's looking back at her. ""When you go through a transition like this, your body, your face is always changing. So, in an industry where you're being paid to sell either a product or take a photo, you know you have to learn your angles,"" she says. What about the question that every woman dreads: Do you think you're pretty? ""I'm very happy with myself,"" she says. ""It's not even about being pretty or being beautiful, it's just that I'm very happy with myself."" ""And I can't change, even if I tried,"" Carrera sings along to Mary Lambert while striking a pose. ""All of the designers were super excited we were shooting her. They flew in clothing for her,"" says Page, who added that she hopes the shoot in an international glossy legitimizes Carrera's career beyond the transgender realm. Carrera wants that level of success, too. She says she looks up to the supermodels of the '90s: the Christy Turlingtons, Naomi Campbells and Linda Evangelistas. The ones who were on a first-name basis with the world. Casting the outcast at Fashion Week . ""I want to be like those girls,"" she says. ""I don't want to just be labeled as a transgender model. ...Why do I have to be separated? It's the modeling industry -- one industry.""","Transgender model Carmen Carrera recently shot a spread for Glamour Magazine UK .

"As the night wore on, the buildings at Karachi's Jinnah International Airport stood out, silhouetted against a backdrop of oily, orange blazes, the night air punctuated with the unmistakable chatter of machine-gun fire. We arrived on the scene shortly after the Taliban-claimed attack began on the country's largest airport on Sunday night, which left 28 dead -- including 10 attackers -- and 24 injured. The airport, located off the city's main arterial Shahrah-e-Faisal road, had already been sealed off by Pakistan Rangers, a heavily-armed paramilitary force. A number of vehicles -- both emergency and military -- lined the route in. We watched hundreds more rangers pouring in on the back of pickup trucks, guns mounted on top of each one. Terminal targeted . Even by the time the media had assembled at the scene, it was apparent things were far from settled. There was a commotion of people around the airport as gun battles still raged nearby, while thick plumes of black smoke drifted high into the sky as what smelled like aviation fuel burned. The gunmen had targeted Terminal 1, the old terminal that had fallen out of regular use. This terminal is only ever used for people flying to and from pilgrimages, for private flights, or sometimes government flights. The gunmen may have chosen this part of the airport as an infiltration point because it is largely vacant. The attackers were trying to cut through barbed wire to get into the airport when they were spotted by Airport Security Force personnel (ASF). A heavy gun battle ensued and four ASF members were killed -- the first fatalities of the attack. The terrorists apparently divided into two groups and hid in two different hangars near the terminal building. One was a hangar run by the national carrier, Pakistan International Airways (PIA), and the other to the right -- where the thick black smoke plumed up before their eyes -- was a large hangar, known as the Ispahani hangar, which is used for wide-body aircraft maintenance. Police said one gunman detonated a suicide vest after being cornered in one of the hangars that contained fuel. Gunmen killed . By the early hours of Monday morning, senior government officials had made the VIP area of the terminal building their makeshift command center. We'd just finished an interview with the chief minister of Sindh province, Qaim Ali Shah, when a group of senior military and police chiefs walked in looking very confident. They shook hands with the chief minister and declared that the militants had been killed. There was a quiet a moment of relief among everyone in the room. By contrast, we witnessed a disheveled group of airport workers leaving the building shortly after, their clothes soiled and torn. Most would not talk to the media, saying they were too traumatized to discuss their ordeal. But one older man described how the gunmen ran towards him and his colleagues and started shooting. He said they ran and hid in the toilet. While they were in there, he said they heard what they thought was a bomb. Though they feared the roof would collapse on them, they stayed hidden there for hours until soldiers arrived and told them it was safe to come out. The eyewitness, who asked not to be named, said some of the assailants were disguised as airport security workers, something that was later corroborated by Sindh Security Unit's (SSU) Mohammed Waqar. He said others were dressed in black as airport security force commandos.","Gunmen disguised as airport security workers attack Karachi's airport .

"Donald Trump is tweeting that ""We should not be importing (Ebola) to our homeland."" An Indiana congressman is worried that refugee children from Central America could pose a public health risk with ""Ebola circulating."" And the Twitter-sphere is filled with people asking ""how can we bring these patients to America,"" complaining that ""We don't have enough problems in America! Let's import Ebola patients!"" and speculating that treating them here is ""highly irresponsible."" But the actual possibility of catching Ebola is incredibly remote. It's a terrifying disease for sure. It typically kills 90% of the people who get it, and this most recent outbreak is the largest in history. But you don't need to panic, experts say, and you definitely don't have to worry about the two American Ebola patients who are being treated in Atlanta. Here are five reasons why: . 1. It's fragile. Ebola is an incredibly fragile virus. It does not fly through the air with the greatest of ease.  It cannot be transmitted through a cough or sneeze. It doesn't move easily from human to human like the common cold. Ebola is aggressively infectious, so people who are infected are highly likely to get sick. But it's not highly contagious. ""The Ebola virus spreads through direct contact with the blood, secretions or other body fluids of ill people and indirect contact -- for example, with needles and other things that may be contaminated with these fluids,"" said Stephan Monroe, deputy director of the Centers for Disease Control's National Center for Emerging Zoonotic and Infectious Diseases. That's why health care providers who work in countries without proper protective gear can get it. That's also why people preparing bodies for burial have gotten it. 2. We know how it works. Although there is no vaccine and no cure, the one real advantage we have with Ebola is that doctors know how to control it. Ebola isn't ""some mystical pathogen (with) some bizarre mode of transmission,"" said Bruce Ribner, who oversees the special isolation unit that is treating the patients at Emory University Hospital. Common-sense hygiene can stop its spread. ""Ebola is a virus that can be stopped and not spread in hospitals. The stakes are higher, but it's easily inactivated with typical hospital disinfectants,"" said Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Tom Frieden. What to know about Ebola . 3. We have the resources to contain it. The two American patients with Ebola were flown to the United States in a plane outfitted with an isolation pod. They are being kept in isolation at the Emory hospital with a specialized containment ward, one of four in the country. In the containment ward, the vents are specialized. There's an intercom and plate glass that separates  patients from  visitors so they don't come into direct contact. There's a strict protocol on everyone and everything that goes into and out of the patient's room. Health care workers wear protective suits. But any major medical center could really take care of an Ebola patient, said William Schaffner, an expert on infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University's School of Medicine. Most ICUs have isolation rooms that are used for patients suspected to have tuberculosis, SARS, Middle East respiratory syndrome or another infectious disease. Schaffner said that not much would be different for an Ebola patient, though more stringent precautions might be taken to ensure that health care workers are following all protocols. 4. Our medical staff is ready. ""We have been training for this,"" Ribner said of preparations for the two American Ebola patients. These doctors know how to handle Ebola and will use an abundance of caution when working with an infected person. Medical workers across the country have also been told to watch out for Ebola symptoms and question patients who have recently traveled to West Africa. They are trained to recognize Ebola cases and can quarantine them early, keeping others from coming into contact with an infected person's bodily fluids while the disease runs its course. 9 questions about this new Ebola drug . 5. Airports are on alert. At African airports in the Ebola-affected region, passengers are being closely screened.  Health experts are watching for people with high fevers. Those who have a temperature are removed and monitored while doctors test their blood for Ebola. When passengers arrive at the airport, they are required to wash their hands in a chlorinated solution. Customs agents and  passport inspectors are also wearing surgical gloves when interacting with passengers. ""There is always the possibility that someone with an infectious disease can enter the United States,"" CDC spokeswoman Barbara Reynolds said Monday. ""The public health concern is whether it would spread and, if so, how quickly.'"" What is the risk of catching Ebola on a plane? At U.S. airports, trained federal agents also watch for sick passengers. Border patrol is asking about potential exposure.  If someone is sick, agents can remove them and keep them in the special isolation units kept at many U.S. airports until the CDC arrives to ask further questions. Overall, health experts say, the threat to Americans remains relatively small. In the past decade, five people have entered the U.S. known to have a viral hemorrhagic fever, including a case in March of a Minnesota man diagnosed with Lassa fever after traveling to West Africa. No one else contracted the disease.","Ebola is aggressively infectious; it is not highly contagious .

"A doctor at a government-run Ebola treatment center in Monrovia is too busy to mince words. ""You have so many patients in agony. Patients are crying in pain,"" said Soka Moses. ""They are dying and all you do is you watch them die sometimes. You pray for them and do the little you do, and just hope that something miraculous happens,"" he said. Moses got just one day's training before jumping in to treat high-risk Ebola patients, which he says is typical. You simply do what needs to be done here, he said. At his center, one patient is too weak to hold up his own head. He writhes in pain as he's given water to drink. Another is laid on the floor because there is no place else to put him. There are two patients for every bed. ""Life is rough, and then you die. What else can we do? If we don't do it, who will do it for us?"" asked Moses. ""We have to take the risk and cater to the patients, or else our country will be wiped away."" 'The poor are left to die' West Africa is in the midst of the worst Ebola outbreak in history. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that some 9,000 people have contracted the disease so far. Heath officials put the death toll at around 4,500, meaning that one in two people who get Ebola in this outbreak die. The odds are not good. They are especially not good for patients who are poor and live in places with underfunded and mismanaged health systems -- countries like Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia, which have been hardest hit. Although much has been made of the cases in Spain and the United States, nearly all of the people getting sick from Ebola are in West Africa. ""The rich get the best care. The poor are left to die,"" the World Health Organization said last month. The outbreak highlights the dangers of growing social and economic equality, said WHO Director-General Margaret Chan. It also lays bare the risks of a purely profit-driven system. Chan made the point that Ebola emerged nearly four decades ago, but there are still no vaccines and no cure. She wondered why. ""Answer: because Ebola has been, historically, geographically confined to poor African nations. ""The R&D incentive is virtually nonexistent. A profit-driven industry does not invest in products for markets that cannot pay,"" the WHO said. WHO to review Ebola response amid criticism . 'Stop it at its source' There are signs, however, that attitudes are changing. A deadly virus anywhere is a threat to everywhere now. ""We can't just cut ourselves off from West Africa where this disease is raging. Our medical experts tell us that the best way to stop this disease is to stop it at its source, before it spreads even wider and becomes even more difficult to contain,"" President Barack Obama said recently. ""If we want to protect Americans from Ebola here at home, we have to end it over there,"" he said. To that point, here's a look at what's happening in West Africa: . Liberia . The WHO says the outbreak in Liberia is by far the most worrisome. Approximately 2,500 people have died there, according to health officials, but that figure is almost certainly higher. Some families are reportedly hiding deaths to circumvent the government's mandatory cremation policy. ""The true number of deaths will likely never be known, as bodies in the notoriously poor, filthy and overcrowded West Point slum, in the capital, Monrovia, have simply been thrown into the two nearby rivers,"" the WHO said last month. According to the organization, new cases are increasing exponentially and there are many more patients than beds. Further complicating efforts there, health workers have threatened to strike over pay and unsafe working conditions. ""I don't want to strike, but the President (of Liberia) has to listen,"" said Moses, the doctor. ""You don't want to have angry people knocking at your doors during this kind of emergency situation, so the President has to listen and act very fast."" Sierra Leone . In terms of sheer numbers, Sierra Leone is second hardest-hit by the Ebola outbreak. Close to 1,200 people have died there. Among the dead are doctors and nurses, which slows down the country's capacity to respond. Every district is affected, according to Doctors Without Borders, or MSF. The government has put five districts under quarantine, preventing people from leaving the area, the humanitarian organization said. MSF also said it was seeing more orphaned children in its centers and a lack of caregivers. Guinea . The first case in this deadly outbreak has been identified by the WHO as a 2-year-old boy in the Guinean village of Meliandou. He fell ill and died in December. The area in southern Guinea is close to the Sierra Leone and Liberia borders, and the disease spread quickly. In total, more than 800 people have died there during the outbreak. ""On at least three occasions, prospects for nationwide control looked good and the countdown for a case-free 21-day incubation period began,"" said WHO. ""The country never made it. As the deadline approached, cases suddenly flared up again in previously controlled villages and cities. In other instances, the virus marched on to infect previously untouched areas,"" it said last month. Nigeria and Senegal . The experiences of Nigeria and Senegal offer a rare bright spot in this outbreak. International MSF teams left Nigeria on October 5. If there are no new cases reported there by Monday, the outbreak will be declared officially over there. The virus was introduced in Nigeria by an air traveler, who arrived in Lagos in July. WHO credits an aggressive government response and effective contact tracing for keeping the virus in check. Ebola claimed just eight lives in Nigeria. Meanwhile in Senegal, there was just one confirmed case of Ebola, and that patient made a full recovery. WHO declared the country free of the disease last week.","Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia have been hardest hit .

"(CNN) -- As power couples go, they have the sparkle to supersede even Posh and Becks. He's a decorated soccer star with a World Cup title to his name; she has sold over 70 million albums worldwide. No wonder then, that Gerard Pique and partner Shakira were included in Forbes' 2013 list of the world's most powerful pairings, with David and Victoria Beckham nowhere to be seen. ""Maybe it seems like it's really difficult to manage everything but we are trying to do it as naturally as we can,"" Pique told CNN's Human to Hero series. Read this story in Spanish . ""It's true that maybe sometimes we have to deal with some paparazzi but then I think we are now four years together -- you have to accept it and deal with it and it's no problem."" As a stalwart in defense for Spanish giants Barcelona, Pique can count three European Champions League crowns among his total of 19 domestic trophies, as well as the 2010 World Cup and 2012 European Championship with Spain. Shakira had a No. 1 hit single in 55 countries with ""Hips Don't Lie,"" is a judge on U.S. talent show ""The Voice"" and garnered 595 million YouTube views (and counting) for her 2010 World Cup song ""Waka Waka."" It was during shooting for the video that the two met; four years later they now have a son, Milan, and count as one of the most internationally recognized couples on the planet. So how do they try to maintain a normal life in the midst of all the attention? ""We don't do very different things than the others,"" Pique explains. ""We are like a normal family and we try to spend a lot of time with our son and before that, just to be a good couple -- going to the cinema, going to have dinner. "" Pique is no stranger to scrutiny, though. Playing for one of the world's biggest football clubs means every pass, tackle or movement is magnified and examined in minute detail by a menagerie of pundits and supporters. That intensity of spotlight can easily manifest itself into pressure, and also fear of failure -- even though that word is barely part of Barcelona's recent lexicon. But if ever the 26-year-old required a reminder that losing is not the end of the world, he only needs to look into his young son's eyes. ""It changed everything,"" Pique says of Milan's arrival in January last year. ""You can see that he is new in this world and he doesn't have negative connections -- he's all about laughing, smiling, being happy. It's so funny; I enjoy a lot playing with him. ""We lost 3-0 against Bayern Munich in the semifinals of the Champions League last season and I was really worried and really sad because it was a bad game and then I arrived home, saw Milan and everything changed. ""It's great because he's just 12 months now and it's unbelievable, he is starting to walk and we are enjoying this time a lot."" Pique insists there will be no obligation for his son to support Barca -- even though he was enrolled as a member upon birth -- but it seems inconceivable the inextricable link between the club and his family will ever be lost. Four generations of the Pique clan have been Barca members and Gerard's grandfather, Amador Bernabeu, served as a club director for 23 years. Pique was infused with a love for the team at an early age, recently telling the club's magazine he sings Barca's anthem every night before he goes to bed, explaining that it is ""the only song I know all the way through."" So what exactly does Barca represent for him? ""It means a lot,"" he replies. ""It feels like I'm at home when I'm here in Camp Nou (Barcelona's stadium). ""For me since I was five or six, I came here with my family to watch every game every weekend and it means a lot to me now to be a first-team player because it was my dream since I was a kid. ""I'm enjoying every moment, every year I'm here, and it's good because in the last few years we won a lot of titles and I think we are having a really good moment."" 'More than a club' Barcelona certainly lives up to its ""more than a club"" motto which is rooted in its pride of the Catalonia region it inhabits. The club's axiom allies the promotion of the area's language and culture alongside good causes (the players still bear the name of worldwide charity UNICEF on their shirts). Their fans even staged a pro-independence protest in October 2012 during one of the biggest games in world football -- ""El Clasico"" against Real Madrid -- by singing the Catalan national anthem mid-match. Credited with an estimated 270 million fans worldwide, Barca is a global advert for Catalonia. ""I think for Catalonia, FC Barcelona means a lot because it is one of the top clubs in the world and that means that it's a way to show what Catalonia is in the world,"" Pique says. ""Because sometimes, we are really small and Barcelona is an instrument to show to the world that we are good at a lot of things. One thing is to play football really, really well so for the Catalonian people, the team is really important. ""Not only the soccer team because we have basketball, handball and a lot of sports. I think the Catalonian people really identify with Barcelona -- the fans are really proud of the team and the club."" The magic of Messi . If Barcelona is a symbol of pride for Catalonia, then so is its prized possession -- Lionel Messi. The Argentina striker was crowned FIFA World Player of the Year four times in a row -- that run was ended by Real's Cristiano Ronaldo this week -- and is feted as one of the greatest footballers the game has ever produced. He moved to Spain to join the famed La Masia academy aged 11, alongside Pique, and has spearheaded Barca's assault on all the glittering prizes club football has to offer. The team has claimed 16 trophies since the start of the 2008 season, when Pique returned after a four-year spell at Manchester United in England, and Messi's mountain of goals during that time have played an instrumental part in their success. And Pique says it is a privilege to play with the 26-year-old, who netted an incredible 91 times in 2012. ""I was at the Golden Boot (awards) when he won and it was just amazing what he did,"" he says. ""It doesn't matter now if he's injured and there's some people that are saying maybe now he's not the best, but for me he always will be the best. ""He made all these fans in Barcelona enjoy a lot, playing such a great football and he made us win a lot -- the Champions League, the league. ""We understand each other just with a look one to the other. People like Lionel Messi or Cesc Fabregas, it's been like half of my life playing with them since we were 12 or 13 so we know each other a lot. ""When we are on the pitch, we know what he will do, what Leo will do because we've known each other for a long, long time."" Move to Manchester . For a spell early in Pique's career though, it looked like his Barcelona dream wouldn't be realized. He moved to join Manchester United in 2004, spending four years under the tutelage of Alex Ferguson, one of the most decorated managers in the history of the game. Pique credits his time in England as a steep learning curve, adapting to new methods on the field, and a new language and culture off it. ""I went there as a kid and I think I came back here in Barcelona as a man,"" he says of the time he spent under Ferguson, whose 26 years at United were littered with trophies. World Cup dream . With Barca top of the Spanish league and having made it to the quarterfinals of the Champions League, another silverware-laden club season awaits. But looming large on the horizon is the World Cup in Brazil, where Spain can become only the third team in history to defend the title. ""My goal is to try to win it again,"" Pique says. ""I think our careers are not very long. You can play 12 or 15, maybe 20 years if you are a good professional and you are lucky with the injuries -- you have to try to win anything you can. ""There are some really good players that didn't win anything in their careers, and we are really lucky to be part of a team like Barcelona and a team like the national team of Spain."" Even if Pique's career was to conclude tomorrow, he could still look back on a litany of fond memories and several years of almost unparalleled success. And it is almost certainly his deep bond with Barcelona will persist long after he hands up his boots. ""Now I'm 26 and I hope I can play here for I don't know six, seven, eight years more but you never know what will happen in the future. ""Maybe as a coach; I cannot see myself now being a coach but maybe as a president, you never know.""","Gerard Pique plays football for Spanish giants FC Barcelona .

"(CNN) -- From the realms of science fiction to science fact, the Rosetta mission reached its climax this week when when the mission's scientists succeeded in landing a washing machine-sized probe named Philae on a moving comet after a 6.4 billion mile journey. It has been a decade-long chase around the solar system for the spacecraft to catch up with its constantly moving target, Churyumov-Gerasimenko -- better known as Comet 67P. For many who gaze dreamily at the stars above, this is one of the most exciting thing to happen in recent memory. But why should everyone else care? To answer this question, CNN has brought together five experts in space science to explain why the Rosetta mission is a monumental achievement. Matt Taylor, European Space Agency project scientist: . Rosetta is a big deal, enough to be the sexiest mission ever. Rosetta has rendezvoused, orbited and will soon deploy a lander to the comet surface. If that isn't enough firsts, the orbiter will remain alongside the comet for over a year, watching it grow in activity as it approaches the Sun, getting to within 180 million km in summer next year, when the comet will be expelling hundreds of kilograms of material every second. It's got an awesome profile: the adventure of the decade-long journey necessary to capture its prey, flying past the Earth, Mars and two asteroids on the way. The years of preparation dating back to the days of the Giotto mission. The challenges of flying over 6 billion km to reach the comet, to bulls eye getting into orbit, even after a 31-month nap, around a body we knew next to nothing about at launch, other than it was going to constantly push us away more, the closer we got. The passion and dedication of the teams working for so long on Rosetta to make it work, to do what it was designed for -- science. EXPLORE: Rosetta mission interactive . Rosetta will show us how a comet works. We have been to comets before with spacecraft, observed them for centuries from the ground, but for the first time with Rosetta, we will ""live"" alongside a comet for over a year, sniffing and tasting it, scratching it with the lander, seeing how it is made up and how it evolves in time with its interaction with energy of the Sun. Thought to be predominantly made of ice, comets are also considered to have been a possible delivery mechanism for water to the Earth, along with organic material that could have provided the building blocks for proteins and possibly life. Comets are considered frozen relics of the formation of the solar system and examining comets provides us with an insight into the conditions and composition of that time. We are doing archeology into how our planet was formed and evolved to what we live on today. It's important to understand where we came from, to get an idea of where we should be going. Kathrin Altwegg, principal investigator of ROSINA (Rosetta Orbiter Sensor for Ion and Neutral Analysis): . After a long and tedious voyage, Columbus must have experienced similar emotions a few hundred years ago when he finally saw land as we did when, after 10 years, the European cometary mission Rosetta finally got a glimpse of its target -- comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko. Although we already had pictures of a few comets, we were very much surprised by its irregular shape and its rich chemical composition. And analysis of the cometary coma by our mass spectrometers ROSINA continues to give almost daily new, amazing insights into the ancient history of the formation of our Sun, the planets and the origin of life. To be part of this mission and to see a dream come true is a fantastic experience which makes all the years of hard work well worthwhile. Where do we come from and where do we go to? Are we alone in the universe? These are the questions which are an important part of humanity, the center of most religions, themes for all big philosophers. To be able to answer some aspects of these questions by science is the main driver for cometary missions. Rosetta is the first mission following a comet over a long period; it's the first mission close to a comet (less than 10 km) and it will be the first mission with a cometary lander. It's a mission full of discoveries in line with great missions like Voyager or Cassini. Claudia Alexander, project scientist, U.S. Rosetta Project, Jet Propulsion Laboratory, NASA: . Rosetta is an attempt to explore not only an object (comets) that we don't yet fully understand, but also reach backwards in time, like a detective, to piece together more about our origins. The mission calls on us to be bold, to take on risk. For an engineer, the challenge is like winning the World Series with a home run in the bottom of the ninth in game seven -- something that will call upon all her skill to pull off. I know plenty of people who love a challenge like that. I've waited 10 years to finally be ""here,"" waiting for the landing to take place, and for the comet to start revealing its mysteries. It's a dream come true to get our hands on this substance, metaphorically, and get the physics right, by bringing a laboratory to a comet. Exploration of the planets, of our solar system, extends our ""vision"" as a human race. We need to have such vision to appreciate/nurture Earth, and our place in the universe. The rewards are to add to our collective knowledge, improve our understanding of forming solar system(s), and understanding more about how materials come together to create environment(s) where life might thrive. Alastair Reynolds, science fiction writer, former astrophysicist for the ESA: . After a 10-year mission to hook itself into orbit around 67P, the flow of science from Rosetta has already commenced. 67P is providing surprises, from its double-lobed shape to its varied surface texturing. Not content with looking, though, Rosetta will shortly deploy an even smaller spacecraft to land, anchor itself, and perform physical examination of the surface. Images from Rosetta, backdropped by the comet, already resemble stills from a science fiction film. It's a reminder that we can do amazing things, if we dream big. Why should we care about a mountain-sized ball of dark, dirty ice, when there are so many other places out there? Comets are windows into the dawn of our solar system, telling us about the chemical ingredients that most likely formed the infant seas of our own Earth. Understand comets, and we have a shot at understanding the genesis of life itself -- and for me there is no bigger or more exciting theme than that. This is science fiction made real in terms of the achievement of the mission itself, but Rosetta is also taking us a step closer to answering science fiction's grandest question of all: are we alone? Denton S. Ebel, cosmochemist from the American Museum of Natural History: . There are so many ""firsts"" with Rosetta that make it an amazing, ambitious, and potentially rewarding mission. As a cosmochemist, I'm eager for the chemical and isotopic measurements. Comets preserve the first solids, including ices, formed in the solar system, so the Rosetta measurements will tell us a whole lot about how the solar system formed. Our comet samples from the Stardust mission contained abundant high-temperature minerals. How these rocks formed so far from the young Sun is a major cosmochemical puzzle. As a human, I want to know the internal structure of comets. The Rosetta radar experiment will reveal for the first time how a comet is put together. We need to know these things so that we can protect the Earth and humanity from comets, which have hit the Earth many times in the past. Rosetta is an engineering marvel, as are the MESSENGER and Dawn spacecraft returning important information from Mercury and the asteroid belt. All these missions enlighten humanity about our cosmic neighborhood. We take ownership, and by making it ""our"" solar system, we set the stage for humans to venture beyond the Earth-Moon system. That is the path to a positive future for our species. EXPLORE: Rosetta mission interactive . IN PICTURES: Rosetta through the years .","Rosetta mission lands Philae probe on the surface of a comet .

"(CNN) -- The 2014 World Cup in Brazil has thrown up the chance for revenge and the opportunity for the apprentice to become the master. While the Netherlands will have an early opportunity for payback by taking on Spain in a repeat of the 2010 final, U.S. coach Jurgen Klinsmann will have the chance to lead his side against his native Germany. Germany, coached by Klinsmann's former assistant Joachim Low, and the U.S. are in Group G along with Portugal and Ghana. Klinsmann led Germany to the semifinals in 2006 where it was beaten by eventual winner Italy. But the 49-year-old faces a difficult task to steer the U.S. through the group with Cristiano Ronaldo's Portugal and a tricky Ghana side also in contention. ""We have a big challenge ahead. But it's also exciting,"" Klinsmann told CNN's Shasta Darlington in Bahia, Brazil. ""When you go to a World Cup you want to play the biggest teams."" The contest, which will take place in Recife on June 26, is already being talked about with Low revealing the clash against the U.S. will be ""something special."" ""So, we will be meeting old friends,"" Low told German media. ""It's already something special to have the USA in our group. ""Jurgen and I have had a very good and close relationship for a long time. ""We have always exchanged ideas on a regular basis, but that will certainly change before the World Cup match."" Spain coach Vicente del Bosque revealed he predicted his side would be paired with the Netherlands. His team is aiming to become the first European side to win the tournament in South America. But it will face a tough opening game against the Dutch on June 13 in Salvador. ""I said this morning we were going to get Holland and we did, in the first game no less,"" del Bosque told Spanish TV. ""Holland have changed a little bit, especially in the middle of the park, but they still have (Arjen) Robben, (Robin) Van Persie, (Rafael) Van der Vaart and (Wesley) Sneijder. ""I think it is good for our mentality that we have to prepare from the first day. Holland will demand that we start at our highest level. ""Everything depends not just on our opponents, but on ourselves and the way we mentally approach this competition."" Brazil, the host nation, will kick off its campaign against Croatia on the opening day of the tournament, while it will also face Mexico and Cameroon. ""It is good,"" Brazil coach Luis Felipe Scolari told the tournament's official website. ""England, Italy, Uruguay, that is the toughest group and we are not in this one! ""We open against a European team, which was my preference. We have the clasico, which will be very tough, in the middle. Then Cameroon. I think it's good for us"" England faces a tough task to progress past the group stage after being drawn with Uruguay, Italy and Costa Rica. Roy Hodgson's side opens against Italy on June 15, before taking on Uruguay in Sao Paulo four days later. It will finish up against Costa Rica in Belo Horizone on June 24. ""It's a tough group no doubt about that,"" Hodgson told reporters. ""We've almost got two number one seeds in our group, with Italy and Uruguay. ""Our great advantage is being based in Rio - meaning that we've only got that one really long trip. ""I'm very positive, you just never know. You don't win football matches on paper, you go out on each occasion 11 vs. 11. If you're well prepared you've got a chance to win all three of the games."" While Hodgson might be positive, England Football Association chairman Greg Dyke was rather more downbeat. When England's name was pulled out, Dyke drew his fingers across his throat in a cut-throat gesture. Former Nigeria international Sunday Oliseh believes his country has every chance of making it through to the last-16 after being drawn in Group F with Argentina, Bosnia-Herzegovina and Iran. ""The Nigerians are ecstatic, myself included, because we have Iran in the group -- with all due respect to them I think we should be able to negotiate this encounter,"" he told CNN. ""We've also got Bosnia, who are playing for the first time in the World Cup finals as a nation. Our chances are pretty bright and it's looking interesting."" Nigeria's toughest assignment looks set to come against Argentina and Lionel Messi at Port Alegre on June 25. Oliseh, who played at the 1994 and 1998 World Cup, says Nigeria will have to be at its very best to stop Messi from running riot. ""Messi is one of the best to have ever played football,"" he said. ""He can do everything except head the ball. The question is how do you stop him? ""You can't really if he's on a good day. What we need to worry about is Messi going to be healthy come 2014? If he is healthy, we have a problem. But we have nothing to fear -- for the first time in a long time we feel we have nothing to lose."" Argentina, which won the tournament in 1978 and 1986, will be favorites to top the group and will play Bosnia in Rio de Janeiro in its opening match on June 15. In Group H, Belgium will be confident of qualifying for the next stage after being drawn alongside Algeria, Russia and Korea. The Belgians finished fourth in 1986 but have not appeared in the tournament since 2002. Belgium is highly-fancied to reach the later stages this time around and will meet Algeria in its opening game in Belo Horizonte on June 17. Colombia is in Group C where it will take on Greece, Ivory Coast and Japan. France, which qualified through the playoffs, will take on Switzerland, Ecuador and Honduras. Didier Deschamps, who won the World Cup with Les Bleus in 1998, believes his side can go far in the tournament after seeing off Ukraine in the European playoffs. ""It could have been more complicated, let's be honest,"" he told reporters. ""We'll have our Swiss neighbors, one South American team and Honduras playing a similar style. ""First game is against Honduras, it's the most important one, winning it would put us in the best position. No opponent is easy, we need to be ambitious but reasonable. Before and after the draw our objective is the same: Round of 16."" Former England, Manchester United and Bayern Munich midfielder Owen Hargreaves says France and Argentina are the big winners following the draw. He told CNN: ""France, being the lowest-ranked European team going into the draw, will be thrilled. Colombia have a favorable group as well. ""Argentina are clear favorites in their group and I think Bosnia will finish in second place and make it into the next round."" 2014 World Cup draw: . Group A: Brazil, Croatia, Mexico, Cameroon.

"The burial at sea of Osama bin Laden after he was killed by Navy SEALs last year followed traditional Islamic procedures, according to newly released military e-mails, but less than a dozen ""leadership"" members aboard the Navy carrier where the service took place were informed of the burial. ""Any sailors watch the burial?"" a Navy commander asked the public affairs officer on the USS Carl Vinson in a May 3, 2011, e-mail. The Carl Vinson was the carrier where the SEALs took bin Laden's body by helicopter after he was killed during the May 2, 2011, raid at his compound in Pakistan. Panetta: Al Qaeda down but not out .

Ten heavily redacted e-mails were released by the Department of Defense in response to a Freedom of Information lawsuit initially filed by the watchdog group Judicial Watch. In communications between high-ranking officers, the e-mails describe Islamic burial procedures being carried out with no fanfare, apparently with few of the officers and enlisted personnel aboard the huge carrier aware of what was going on aboard their ship.

"We're all familiar with the phrase ""waste not, want not,"" but how well are we applying these words today? For many of us, we buy more than we need, we spend more than we earn, we eat more than our fill. The consequence of excessive living and waste affect not only us, but also our global neighbors and future generations. Over the past two decades, food waste and obesity have nearly doubled at equal rates. The surface area of the average dinner plate expanded by 36 percent between 1960 and 2007. Parallel to increased portion sizes, between 1987 and 2010, the number of Americans diagnosed with diabetes almost tripled to 20.9 million. While we are responsible for our own choices, the results we are experiencing aren't merely a matter of choice. We are not genetically programmed to turn down excess calories when they are in front of us. Studies have shown that if our plate contains more food than our body physically needs, we will eat it without conscious consideration. A recent study shows 50 percent of all food produced on the planet goes in the trash. Even more disturbing, 90 percent of water consumed in the United States is for animal and crop-related farm uses. That means food waste accounts for more than a quarter of our total water consumption. In short, water that is needed for farmland and animals becomes a wasted resource when uneaten food gets thrown away. A study conducted last year analyzed the climate change and economic impact of food waste in the U.S. to calculate greenhouse gas emissions due to thrown out food. The results were appalling. It found that food waste in the U.S. exceeds 55 million tonnes per year, which produces life cycle greenhouse gas emissions of at least 133 million metric tonnes and costs $198 billion. But this isn't just an American stereotype played out. In Toronto, Canada more than 17.5 million kilograms of food is thrown out every month and in Britain, the government's Waste & Resources Action Programme estimates that $17.5 billion worth of food is wasted every year. The way our food production system is structured, supplying demand, not need, has an exponential significance on obesity and food waste at all stages - supply, distribution, preparation and consumption. The cost of oil, fuel, energy and harvesting labor that goes into producing food all gets wasted when food from large portions goes uneaten and tossed. Though this may feel like a catch 22, the good news is it is 100 percent preventable. A representative of the Grocery Manufacturers Association, which represents food manufactueres such as Kraft, Hershey and Coca-Cola said it best, ""there is no bigger opportunity for our industry to simultaneously address hunger and our environmental footprint than by reducing the amount of food sent to landfills by diverting food to food banks and food waste to beneficial alternatives like compost."" Opportunities pop up everyday that provide the chance to be responsible consumers. From going ""halfsies"" with your portions to starting up your own personal compost -- the action needed to spur behavior change and reverse our global food waste epidemic is less challenging than you might think. Our personal decisions matter. The earth cannot continue to withstand our excesses and neither can our waistlines. Practicing the ""waste not"" wisdom consistently over time will have a profound generational and global impact.","Over the past two decades, food waste and obesity have nearly doubled at equal rates .

"After duking it out in 2012's often nasty presidential race, the campaign managers for Mitt Romney and President Barack Obama have joined forces. Jim Messina, who ran the president's re-election, and Matt Rhoades, a veteran of the Romney operation, are working behind the scenes of Washington's bid to host the 2024 Summer Olympics. The duo's specific project -- a small part of the overall mission -- is to convince the U.S. Olympic Committee, that yes, sometimes both parties can come together for a common purpose, and that Washington is not just a hotbed of partisan warfare all of the time. To make the case, the Washington bid's team put together this video, posted online Tuesday featuring a bipartisan cast. Making cameo appearances are CNN contributor Newt Gingrich, the Republican former House speaker; Virginia's Democratic Sens. Mark Warner and Tim Kaine; Georgia Democratic Rep. John Lewis; DC Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton; Mayor-elect Muriel Bowser; and to press the point, a losing presidential hopeful from each party, Democrat Howard Dean and Republican Bob Dole. The trio of other remaining cities don't have to concern themselves with the political consideration. Boston, Los Angeles and the San Francisco bay area also are taking part in the bid selection process. The committee will choose early next year which of the remaining four American cities will be the finalist to compete in 2017 to be the International Olympic Committee's choice for the 2024 games.","Former presidential campaign rivals Jim Messina and Matt Rhoades join forces to bring the Olympics to DC .

"The brazen terrorist assault on Pakistan's largest Karachi Airport that began near midnight Sunday left almost everybody stunned. It was the Pakistani Taliban's biggest strike on state security apparatus -- in terms of human casualties -- and is a reminder of the massive security challenge that comes from affiliates of al Qaeda holed up in the mountainous Pakistan-Afghanistan border terrain. Of the 28 dead, 10 were attackers who were killed during a firefight which latest several hours. Almost all of the suspected gunmen were reportedly wearing suicide vests, devices usually worn by terrorists on termination missions. Military officials said two of the terrorists had detonated suicide vests. By putting down the attackers, the security forces most probably preempted a big hostage-taking too; reports the terrorists had foodstuffs like dates, chickpeas, hand-grenades and petrol bombs suggest they came for the long haul. What was the motive for the attack? As usual, the outlawed Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) claimed responsibility for the Karachi carnage. ""This was revenge for Hakimullah Mehsud's martyrdom"" (Mehsud was killed in a U.S. drone strike in November, 2013), and a warning against the impending military operation the government is preparing against the ""helpless and innocent tribes in Waziristan,"" a TTP statement sent to media via email said. In an earlier message on their Facebook page, the TTP said: ""The biggest reason for attacking Karachi airport is because it serves as the biggest air logistics center supplying goods for the Crusaders' war in Afghanistan and Pakistan,"" referring to the Karachi Port which handles the Afghanistan-bound U.S.-NATO cargo. Is the first such assault . TTP made a similar claim following a dramatic raid on Peshawar's Bacha Khan International Airport on December 15, 2012. The group also took responsibility for similar commando raids on the Pakistan Navy airbase PNS Mehran near Karachi in May 2011, followed by a deadly assault on a Pakistan Air Force base at Kamra, 70 kilometers north of the capital, in August 2012. All three resulted in damage to several air-surveillance and combat aircraft, including a multi-million dollar Saab 2000 surveillance aircraft. The TTP justified the three attacks as ""revenge"" for the May 2, 2011 secret U.S. raid that killed Osama Bin Laden in his Abbottabad compound. At the early stage of investigations, a number of questions and theories can be raised. Were attackers trying to discredit Pakistan? The TTP again appears to be at the center of a terrorist pattern that ostensibly aims to hurt he country's economic interests and isolate it internationally. Following a brazen daylight attack on the visiting Sri Lankan cricket team in March 2009, for instance, all foreign cricket teams refused to visit Pakistan, thus bringing an end to international cricket in the country. ""The only message flowing from these strikes is that foreigners and foreign airlines should not fly into Pakistan,"" Talat Masood, a retired general told me. He also recalled the coldblooded execution on June 23, 2013, of 10 foreign tourists in an unprecedented attack in the Himalayas of Nanga Parbat, one of the highest peaks in the world. The nighttime raid at a height of over 4,000 feet killed three Ukrainians, two Slovakians, one Lithuanian, two Chinese, one Chinese-American, one Nepali and their Pakistani guide -- in what was the worst attack on foreigners in Pakistan in a decade. What was the role of foreign fighters in the Karachi attack? Major General Rizwan Akhtar, the head of the paramilitary outfit Rangers, who led the operation, hinted at the possible involvement of Uzbek militants in the deadly attack. ""From their appearances they look like Uzbeks but we will wait for DNA tests to say something with authority,"" Akhtar responded when asked whether foreign terrorists carried out the assault. And this is not the first time officials named Uzbeks as part of an extremely well-coordinated strike. The TTP appears to enjoy active support of fighters that belong to the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan (IMU), a dissident group that escaped persecution in Uzbekistan and settled down in the mountainous region of Waziristan between Pakistan and Afghanistan following the Taliban regime's defeat in December 2011. Particularly since the killing of its leader Tahir Yuldashev in an August 2009 drone strike, the IMU has increasingly gravitated towards al Qaeda central and acted as its militant arm against the Pakistani security apparatus, which it sees as the major stumbling block in its fight for survival in Pakistan. Did the attackers have inside information? TTP and its foreign affiliates draw support from ""the enemy within."" ""Such a coordinated attack is not possible without inside information,"" Jalam Hussein, a former Pakistan Air Force commodore told me. ""We really have to think very seriously of purging the security apparatus of such inside supporters,"" he said. What was the influence of recent peace talks? The recent breakdown of TTP talks with government also revived a new string of attacks against security and strategic targets; despite a several week engagement, the talks offered by Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif in an attempt to improve internal security led nowhere. The government and the security forces found it impossible to accept TTP demands like enforcement of Sharia across the board, withdrawal of the army from the tribal regions and a peace zone for itself. And soon after the stalemate became evident, the army began pounding IMU and Chinese Uyghur hideouts in the Waziristan mountains, where the TTP provides them social cover. The East Turkestan Islamic Movement (ETIM) represents Uyghur Muslims who want an independent Xinjiang and have been reportedly waging a war on Chinese interests from the Pakistan-Afghan border region. Was the attack linked to a ""proxy war?"" Some officials tie the TTP-led terror campaign to the proxy war that both Pakistan and India have been involved in for quite some time. Some Pakistanis accuse the TTP of being an Indian proxy, while among the Indian and Afghan establishments there are those who treat Afghanistan's Taliban, particularly the Haqqani Network, as Pakistani proxies. Often, Indian officials blame attacks on Indian interests on the Pakistani spy agency ISI, including the suicide strike at India's consulate in the western Afghan city of Herat last month. What does the attack reveal about security in Karachi? Lastly, the Karachi attack, too, exposed the weaknesses in the early warning capacity of the Pakistani security apparatus; while forces on ground managed to engage and neutralize the attackers within five hours -- restoring air traffic by noon -- questions loom over the intelligence. Hasan Askari Rizvi, a prominent security commentator based at Lahore, wonders as to how such a big number of attackers remained undetected. This requires a deep introspection and represents a huge challenge for the government and the entire security agencies. Counter-terrorism would require extremely close coordination, which could possibly help in early warning as well, he said.","28 people died in an attack on Karachi's Jinnah International Airport, Pakistan's military says .

"The ""Three Amigos"" -- or, as they're more formally known, the leaders of the United States, Canada and Mexico -- announced an agreement Wednesday to work on a plan to streamline trade and travel, including border controls among the countries. U.S. President Barack Obama, Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper and Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto agreed to streamline border controls to facilitate the movement of people through the establishment of a trusted traveler program. They also spent a great deal of time during the North American Leaders' Summit discussing efforts to broker a new trade agreement with Pacific nations, they said in a joint news conference after the summit in Toluca, Mexico. Obama has called for ""fast-track"" trade authority from Congress for him to pursue the so-called Trans-Pacific Partnership, a massive free-trade zone. But members of his own party, including House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, have voiced firm opposition to such authority. Republicans seized on Vice President Joe Biden's reported comments at last week's House Democratic retreat in Maryland. There, he was heard conceding the trade issue was quickly becoming a source of frustration within the party, especially among labor groups that are key to midterms next fall. ""The jobs they seem to care about most are Democrats in Congress -- not families across the country eager to join the ranks of the employed,"" Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said in a statement. Senior Obama administration officials played down reports about Biden's comments as coming from ""second-hand accounts."" But, they added, the White House remains firmly committed to its trade agenda. ""It would not be in the interest of the United States to put this on the back burner,"" one official said. White House spokesman Jay Carney insists that differences among Democrats over trade issues date back several administrations. ""The differing opinions on these matters are not new, and the fact that there are differing opinions within both parties is not new,"" Carney said Tuesday. Another area of friendly disagreement for the ""Three Amigos"" is over the Obama administration's handling of the Keystone XL pipeline. Canadian officials have grown impatient with the lengthy approval process in the United States for the contested project, which would transport oil from Alberta to the Gulf of Mexico. While a recent State Department environmental impact study appeared to brighten prospects for approval, senior administration officials indicated Harper is not likely to receive the news many in his nation want to hear during the summit. ""I think what President Obama will do is explain to him where we are in the review of the Keystone pipeline, and indicate that we'll, of course, let our Canadian friends know when we've arrived at a decision,"" a senior administration official said. The Keystone project has also divided Democrats, namely environmentalists who see the pipeline as a symbolic battle in the larger fight over efforts to deal with climate change. While in Mexico, Obama faced another delicate balancing act over the issue of immigration reform. The plight of undocumented immigrants in the United States, notably the substantial number of migrants who crossed the border from Mexico, is a major political issue south of the Rio Grande. Latino special interest groups, a core Democratic Party constituency, have criticized the administration for its aggressive deportation policy as it struggles to find a long-term solution to the immigration issue. Senior administration officials told reporters last week that Obama remains committed to comprehensive immigration reform that includes a pathway to citizenship for undocumented workers. But that legislative priority has hit a roadblock in Congress, where Republican leaders have indicated there is little hope for a breakthrough this year before the midterms. ""With respect to immigration, I think President Peña Nieto has a very good understanding, frankly, of the state of play in the United States,"" a senior administration official said.","Three nations will streamline border controls .
The three leaders are called the ""Three Amigos""

"It's a conflict culled from the suspicion-filled pages of the Cold War. Russia's upper house of Parliament gives the green light for the incursion of military forces into Ukraine's volatile Crimea region. President Vladimir Putin justifies the move as a necessary step to the protection of Russian citizens and military personnel in southern Crimea. Ukraine's new government calls out what it calls Russia's threat on its sovereignty. Map: A divided Ukraine . U.S. President Barack Obama warns of the ""costs"" Russia faces for its actions. With Ukraine possibly teetering on the brink of war, here are three things you need to know about the conflict. 1. What is the Black Sea Fleet? A justification for Russian might in the region is its claim of the need protect the Black Sea Fleet in the Ukraine. Based in Sevastopol, the force is the smallest of the Russian navy's four fleets -- which once included some 18 submarines, two cruisers, 30 destroyers and frigates and around 100 smaller combat ships, according to Jane's International Defense Review. Many vessels are aging and in need of maintenance. The Russian navy has had a base in Sevastopol for 230 years. The ships and subs are based just north of Turkey and can reach the Mediterranean. The fleet has been a point of contention since 1954, when the former Soviet Union transferred the Crimea, including Sevastapol, to Ukraine, according to Jane's. In 2010, the two countries reached an agreement to permit the fleet to stay in Sevastopol until 2042. Under the deal, Ukraine received a 30% discount on the cost of natural gas supplies from Russia, potentially saving Ukraine up to between $40 billion over a10-year period. The fleet has allowed Moscow to exert its influence in the Eastern Mediterranean, Balkans and Middle East, according to Christian Le Miere, an expert at the International Institute for Strategic Studies. ""The importance of the Mediterranean to Russia was highlighted in 2013, when, amid the civil war in Syria, Moscow declared the creation of a 'permanent task force' for the sea and bolstered its presence to 10 vessels,"" he wrote. ""In August 2008, it was the Black Sea Fleet that provided the 13 vessels used to defeat the small Georgian navy and land troops in Abkhazia and Poti during the brief war."" 2. How close is Russia to sending more troops? According to the Russian state news agency Itar-Tass, the country's constitution requires that the Federation Council must consider and debate the use armed forces outside Russia following a request from the president. The request should contain ""sound reasons"" for the use of the military. The chair of the council then sends the request to the upper house's committee on defense and security and the committee on international relations. After the council considers the request, the president and the prime minister are invited to attend a council meeting, according to Itar-Tass. The meeting opens with a report delivered by the president or a representative. Then, the conclusions of the council committees on defense and security and international relations are read. A final decision on allowing the use of the armed forces outside the country must be adopted by a majority of the council members and and made formal in a resolution of the upper house, according to the news agency. The document is forwarded to the president within two days of its adoption. 3. Is there a precedent for what might unfold? In 2008, Russia's incursion into the former Soviet republic of Georgia followed the launch of a Georgian campaign against the Russian-backed separatist territory of South Ossetia. Russian tanks, troops and armored vehicles poured into South Ossetia and another breakaway Georgian territory, Abkhazia, advancing into Georgian cities across the administrative borders within those regions. The two sides blamed each other for starting the conflict, as well as for a wide variety of offenses leading up to and during the fighting, including ethnic cleansing. Russia and Georgia signed a French-brokered, six-point cease-fire agreement that allowed Russian forces to establish a buffer zone inside Georgia within a few kilometers of South Ossetia.

"The Department of Justice has sent a letter to House Speaker John Boehner saying it will not ask the U.S. Supreme Court to review a federal appeals court ruling that blocked new graphic warnings on cigarette packages. The government had until April 5 to appeal the ruling, which struck down the mandate, saying the requirements were a violation of free speech protections. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration instead will ""undertake research to support a new rule-making consistent with the Tobacco Control Act,"" the FDA said in a written statement, meaning the agency will have to create new warning labels to comply with the 2009 law. A federal judge in March 2012 had ruled in favor of the tobacco companies, and in August in a 2-1 ruling, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia panel affirmed that ruling. The American Cancer Society and the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids both called on the FDA to quickly develop new warnings. The cancer society said current warning labels, which have been around for 25 years, are now ineffective. ""Every day that the current warnings remain in place is another day in which the tobacco industry misleads children and adults about the hazards of smoking and the health of the nation is compromised,"" Chris Hansen, president of the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network, said in a news release. FDA reveals bigger, graphic warning labels for cigarette packages . The Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids said it believed the appeals court ruling was wrong on science and the law. It said in a statement that tobacco companies are fighting the graphic warnings because they know they are effective. ""The graphic warnings would counter the industry's deception and tell the truth about how deadly and unglamorous smoking truly is,"" Matthew L. Myers, president of Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, said. R.J. Reynolds, the tobacco giant involved in the lawsuit, didn't immediately respond to an email seeking comment. The proposed images include a man exhaling smoke through a hole in his throat; diseased lungs next to healthy lungs; a mouth bearing what appear to be cancerous lesions; a bare-chested male cadaver with chest staples down his torso. The word and image warning labels would have covered half of the cigarette packs sold at retail outlets and 20% of cigarette advertising. The federal law in question would also regulate the amount of nicotine and other substances in tobacco, and limit promotion of the products and related promotional merchandise at public events like sporting contests. Tobacco giants suing FDA over warning labels mandate . Several other lawsuits over the labels are pending in federal court, part a two-decade federal and state effort to force tobacco companies to limit their advertising and settle billions of dollars in state and private class-action claims over the health dangers of smoking. According to the Centers for Disease Control the percentage of adult Americans who smoke has declined since 1965 from 42.4% to 18.9% in 2011, but the rate has leveled off in recent years. Cigarette smoking is the leading cause of ""preventable death"" in the United States, the CDC said, killing about 443,000 people per year as of 2004.","FDA will design new labels after graphic ones were invalidated in court .

"When Jody Sabatino opened her mailbox last month, she got some jaw-dropping news: Her insurance company, UnitedHealthcare, was cutting the 79-year-old's most trusted doctor from its Medicare Advantage plan. In fact, four of her six regular doctors won't be covered at all next year. ""I couldn't believe it. I just couldn't believe it,"" Sabatino said. What's easier to believe for those affected by the cuts is that because Obamacare makes it harder for insurers to cut patients from their rolls, they're cutting doctors instead -- and hoping patients follow them off the plan. United's move left Sabatino and her 94-year-old husband, Nick, facing a tough choice: Do they stay with United and find new doctors or try to keep their doctors by finding a new insurance plan? ""Dr. Mieczkowski has been my doctor for 20 years. No one knows me any better than he does, and it's silly not to continue to go with him,"" Sabatino said. So she went shopping. And the insurance plan she bought is going to cost her more. Of the eight prescriptions that United covered, half of them are either going to cost more or aren't covered at all under her new plan. Insurers ease deadline to pay for Obamacare policies . But by switching plans, Jody Sabatino gets to keep Dr. Lawrence Mieczkowski, or ""Dr. Mitch."" The cardiometabolic specialist will be unceremoniously dumped from United's Medicare Advantage network next year with little explanation. ""Given the significant changes and pressures in the health care environment, we have undertaken a review of our network and are making changes to its composition,"" United wrote to Mieczkowski in an August letter. ""As a result, UnitedHealthcare is amending your agreement referenced above to discontinue your participation in the Medicare Advantage network effective on January 1, 2014. ... This amendment does not require your signature."" But the doctor thinks United is trimming physicians from its networks in hopes that their patients will follow. ""Let those high-cost patients move out of the UnitedHealthcare Medicare Advantage plan over to Anthem or Humana and let those poor suckers, so to speak, pick up the cost,"" Mieczkowski said. In Ohio, where Mieczkowski practices outside Dayton, hundreds of doctors and thousands of patients have been affected by United's cuts. And in Connecticut, United cut about 20% of its doctors, according to the state medical society. The American Medical Association says United and other insurers have taken similar action in at least a dozen states. ""The patient costs a lot,"" said Todd Baker of the Ohio State Medical Association. ""And United is going to those patients' doctors and dropping them and therefore getting rid of the patient."" United concedes it is reducing the size of its Medicare Advantage network, saying it will shrink by about 10% to 15% by the end of next year. ""Many health plans are making changes to their networks to improve quality and keep health insurance affordable,"" United said in a statement to CNN. ""These changes are necessary to meet rising quality standards in an era of Medicare funding cuts, and will improve our ability to work closely with physicians and encourage better health outcomes for our members."" The insurance industry's trade group argues that the changes are a direct result of Obamacare. To help pay for health care reform, lawmakers included $200 billion in cuts to the Medicare Advantage program and a new tax on health insurers. ""Washington can't cut and tax the Medicare Advantage program this much and not expect seniors in the program to be harmed. And that's exactly what we're starting to see,"" said Robert Zirkelbach of America's Health Insurance Plans. ""This is just the beginning. As more and more of these cuts go into effect over the next several years, seniors are going to face even higher premiums, higher out-of-pocket costs for services and fewer health care choices."" And even though Sabatino was able to find a plan that allows her to continue to see Mieczkowski, she will still lose two other specialists. ""We're walking away from people that we've known and trusted and counted on for over 10 years, and that's hard,"" she said. ""That's hard."" Christie on Obamacare ad: Get out of your PJs .

"(CNN)They are two of the continent's acknowledged football powerhouses and later Sunday either Ivory Coast or Ghana will end a long and frustrating wait to be crowned Africa Cup of Nations champions. Ghana last lifted the trophy 33 years ago and was beaten in the 1992 final by Ivory Coast, the last time The Elephants claimed the prestigious crown. The meeting in Bata will bring down the curtain on a tournament -- hosted at the last minute by Equatorial Guinea after Morocco declined because of Ebola fears -- which has seen some fine football but also been blighted by crowd trouble inside and outside the stadiums. Ghana's 3-0 semifinal win over the hosts saw the worst scenes, with a helicopter deployed to disperse fans at the Estadio de Malabo and the game held up for several minutes. Overshadowed by the violent scenes was a solid team performance by the Black Stars, with Andre Ayew, the son of the legendary Abedi 'Pele' Ayew, rounding off the scoring with his third goal of the competition. Ivory Coast, with a host of talented players such as Manchester City's Yaya Toure and the club's new signing Wilfried Bony, has come on strong after needing to beat Cameroon to reach the knockout stages. The Ivorians will start marginal favorites to win the Africa Cup of Nations for the second time. Ghana is a four-time winner and has five wins in nine matches with Ivory Coast at the finals, losing three with the other drawn.","Ivory Coast and Ghana meet in Africa Cup of Nations final .

"A gunman who opened fire at a New Jersey mall Monday night later holed up in a back room and shot himself in the head, authorities say. No one else was injured in the mall shooting. Richard Shoop's body was found at 3:20 a.m. Tuesday in an obscure part of Westfield Garden State Plaza mall, hours after he fired at least six bullets without striking anyone in the massive shopping center. He acted alone, authorities say. ""We know that his intent was either suicide or to do something that would cause police to shoot him, which we call 'suicide by cop,' "" Bergen County Prosecutor John Molinelli told CNN's ""New Day."" ""He had more than enough opportunity to be able to shoot other people,"" including a group adjacent to him, but he didn't, Molinelli said. ""Instead, he shot randomly at different locations."" Shots hit the ceiling, an escalator, an elevator and a storefront, the prosecutor said. The reasons for the shooting remain unclear. Shoop used narcotic drugs and sold drugs as well, Molinelli said. And he left behind a note referring to the idea that the ""end was coming,"" Molinelli said. ""That could mean going to jail, getting arrested, or it could mean suicide."" Authorities don't know whether Shoop left the note immediately before going to the mall. Shoop's brother, Kevin, called authorities after hearing about the shooting and said he thought Shoop might be the gunman, Molinelli said.  Police did not confirm the shooter's identity until they found his body. ""We're not sure exactly what caused him to do this, and we're all devastated,"" Kevin Shoop told reporters Tuesday. ""My brother intended to harm nobody else but himself. He just, sadly, decided to make ... an act of self-indulgence by taking his own life publicly. And it's a tragedy to us all,"" he said. Pandemonium . The melee started about 9:20 p.m. ET Monday night, just as the shopping center was about to close. Thousands of people were still in the mall, Molinelli said. Shoop, dressed all in black and wearing a motorcycle helmet, walked through the mall with a rifle modified to look like an AK-47. The rifle was taken from Shoop's brother, Molinelli said. Allie Cozic, who works in the mall, said everyone was ""running to wherever they could."" ""It was almost like when you're watching a horror movie and the killer is walking slowly. That's what it seemed like,"" she said. ""He was wearing all black. It almost looked like body armor of some kind. As soon as I saw the gun, I just turned and ran."" Eddie Kahmann, another mall employee, said he heard six or seven gunshots. ""There was just people running like crazy, so I quickly just closed my doors, ran to the back, turned off all the lights, music and everything, just to stay hidden,"" he said. The shooting sent panic through the mall and set off a frenzied hunt for the gunman. In the early hours of the search, officials weren't sure whether the shooter was still inside or outside the 2 million-square-foot building. Officers did not fire any shots, Molinelli said, and there was only slight damage to the mall. Even as Shoop's body lay in a remote room in a construction area, fear permeated the mall. More than 100 shoppers were still hiding inside stores early Tuesday morning, unsure of whether they could safely come out. Officers worked to evacuate each store. Signs of trouble . Shoop, 20, was known by local law enforcement. He had a history of drug use and abuse, Molinelli said. ""He at least thought that he was reaching a point where there was no recourse but to take his own life,"" Molinelli said. The owner of a pizza shop where Shoop had been working for about a year said he was a good, trustworthy worker.  Dod Geges, owner of Victor's Pizza Shop, describes Shoop as a nice, quiet guy. But in the last two weeks, ""something was off"" about Shoop, Geges said, adding that he ""wasn't his usual self."" Geges' brother Robert Gega, who manages the restaurant, said Shoop was working 60 hours a week and ""sobering up."" ""He wasn't drinking or drugging,"" Gega said, adding that Shoop had good friends and never gave an indication of contemplating suicide.  ""He would never hurt anyone.""

"London, England (CNN) -- No final decision had been made regarding whether embattled CEO Tony Hayward will leave BP, the company said in a statement Monday morning. ""BP notes the press speculation over the weekend regarding potential changes to management and the charge for the costs of the Gulf of Mexico oil spill. BP confirms that no final decision has been made on these matters,"" the statement said. The statement, which did not mention Hayward by name, said ""any decisions will be announced as appropriate,"" noting that BP's board would meet Monday night ahead of the announcement of its second quarter earnings. Despite widespread media reports that Hayward was on the verge of leaving, BP said Sunday that he still had the company's support. ""Tony Hayward remains our chief executive and has the full support of the board and senior management,"" company spokesman Mark Salt told CNN. Hayward has been in the crosshairs of criticism over his handling of the underwater oil gusher in the Gulf of Mexico ever since the BP-contracted Deepwater Horizon drilling rig exploded in April, killing 11 people and creating the worst oil spill in U.S. history. Some of his public comments about the disaster have sparked outrage in the United States. In May, in the course of apologizing for the spill, Hayward added, ""There's no one who wants this over more than I do. I would like my life back."" And he played down the size of the spill in an interview with the British newspaper The Guardian, saying the amount of oil spilled at that point was ""relatively tiny"" in comparison to the ""very big ocean."" He received a largely bipartisan pounding during an appearance before a congressional committee in June. And when the committee's leading Republican apologized to the BP boss for what he called the Obama administration's ""shakedown"" of the company, swift criticism spurred him to walk back his remarks. BP, rig owner Transocean and oilfield services contractor Halliburton have blamed each other for the disaster, which is under investigation by numerous federal agencies and Congress. British media, The Wall Street Journal and The New York times reported Sunday that Hayward could be out as soon as Monday. The BBC reported that Hayward was ""negotiating the terms of his exit, with a formal announcement likely within 24 hours."" It did not cite a source. The New York Times reported late Sunday that BP's board was expected to name its most senior American executive, Robert Dudley, as its chief executive on Monday, citing a source close to the board. Hayward was pulled off day-to-day leadership of the cleanup operation in June in favor of Dudley. British newspapers said an announcement regarding Hayward would come by Tuesday, when the company is due to report half-year results. They also did not name sources, while the New York-based Journal cited ""people familiar with the matter."" BP has been working with federal and state authorities in the Gulf region since the spill began, but officials there professed little insight into the reports. New Orleans, Louisiana, Mayor Mitch Landrieu noted that people responded negatively to Hayward's ""initial foray"" into the dealing with the now three-month-old spill, but he said the city welcomes any leader the company puts in place. ""It's not necessarily important who the person is, but with BP's ultimate attitude in restoring the damage that they have caused,"" Landrieu told reporters after an aerial tour of the area Sunday. ""So we welcome a positive attitude and a constructive attitude from BP, and we hope, in the future, that we get it."" And Rep. Ed Markey, one of the company's leading critics on Capitol Hill, said the Gulf will spend years recovering from Hayward's ""failed leadership."" ""The new leaders of BP will have an uphill climb to correct the legacy left by Hayward, indelibly inked by the disaster in the Gulf,"" Markey, D-Massachusetts, said in a written statement on the reported-but-still-unconfirmed ouster. The disaster has sent BP's stock price plunging. Meanwhile, U.S. senators want to question Hayward about whether BP was involved in the release from prison of Abdelbeset Ali Mohmed al Megrahi, the Libyan convicted of the 1988 Lockerbie bombing that killed 270 people. Hayward, who has been with the company for 28 years, became chief executive in 2007. Experts told CNN in June that Hayward will probably not get a lucrative package of bonus money and stock awards that many U.S. companies give to outgoing CEOs as so-called golden parachutes. ""He will be lucky to get a single year's salary,"" said Paul Hodgson, a senior researcher at The Corporate Library, a governance group. ""And even that could be mitigated in certain circumstances."" His compensation package -- including salary and bonuses -- was worth 3.158 million British pounds ($4.87 million), according to the company's 2009 annual report. He's also due an annual pension of 584,000 pounds ($901,000). Additionally, he held more than 535,000 shares in the company as of December 31, which would currently be worth about 212 millon pounds (about $327 million).","BP says despite media speculation, no decisions have been made about CEO .

"(CNN) -- Attorney General Eric Holder announced last week that the Justice Department's civil rights investigation of Cleveland's police department found that it engaged in a ""pattern or practice"" of unreasonable and unnecessary use of force. Coming on the heels of the death of 12-year-old Tamir Rice, who was shot and killed by a Cleveland police officer, many have wondered if this conclusion and damning report proves anything about Rice's death. Not directly. But this report doesn't exactly help the public's perception of the Cleveland police, either. To many, the involvement of the federal government in investigating the killings of Rice, Michael Brown, and Eric Garner are a welcome event. After all, federal law enforcement does not have the intimate working relationship that local state investigators likely have with the police force -- a relationship that could compromise an internal investigation. The federal government is designed as a limited government. There is supposed to be no general federal ""police power"" -- that is, no right of the federal government to regulate for the health, safety, or general welfare of the citizenry. The reality is, legislation and court decisions over the past century have gradually expanded the federal government's control and review of local activities. In these cases, authority to review the practices of law enforcement agencies potentially violating federal rights comes from the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994. And the DOJ is increasingly vigilant in enforcing these laws. In just the last five years, the Civil Rights Division initiated more than 20 investigations of police departments, which it claims is more than twice as many investigations than were opened in the previous five fiscal years. It would seem that the modern DOJ has made civil rights a priority. (The Cleveland police said in a statement they've begun remedial measures and ""much more work is needed."") The Cleveland report itself is almost chilling in its detailed narration of specific instances of excessive police force. But that's not all: The reported procedures, policies, and tactics are also equally as concerning. Among the findings: . 1. 'Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice ... ' Would you be surprised to learn that the DOJ previously investigated the CDP in 2002 and found similar deficiencies? How about the fact that in 2004, the Justice Department and CDP entered into an agreement to correct these problems, including revising its use of force policy and establishing new procedures for -- you guessed it -- reviewing officer-involved shootings. However, that prior agreement was not enforced by a court and had no independent monitor. Here's where the DOJ appears to engage in some subtle CYA, when it writes that in 2005, ""we found that Cleveland had abided by that agreement and it was terminated."" In the next sentence, the DOJ adds: ""It is clear, however, that despite these measures, many of the policy and practice reforms (from the) 2004 memorandum agreement were either not fully implemented or ... not maintained over time."" So was the Cleveland force compliant in 2005? Or did the CDP just Jedi-mind-trick the Justice Department about the force, and convince DOJ to move along? 2. 'Beyond a reasonable doubt' is not a two-way street . Apparently investigators in CDP's Internal Affairs Unit only find violations of division policy if the evidence against the officer proves misconduct beyond a reasonable doubt. According to the Justice Department, this is an unreasonably high standard reserved for criminal prosecutions and inappropriate for internal police investigations. Not surprisingly, discipline is comparatively rare at the CDP. Only a small fraction of officers were disciplined in connection with a use of force incident over more than a three year period. The Cleveland Plain Dealer analyzed similar CDP force data in 2007, finding that out of 4,427 uses of force over four years, supervisors justified the force in 100% of those cases. 3. It's the little things ... This is a minor detail, but a potentially divisive one. The DOJ observed a sign hanging in a district station identifying it as a ""forward operating base,"" which is a military term for an outpost in a war zone. People sympathetic to law enforcement might say ""no big deal -- that's part of police culture."" To other members of the community and to the Justice Department, this is disturbing evidence of police culture: that CDP is more of an occupying army than a community partner. 4. What documents? Were this not such a serious matter, the DOJ would LOL at CDP's document retention and production. The Cleveland department failed to produce deadly force investigations that occurred after April of 2013. CDP failed for some time to produce certain 2012 use of less lethal force reports. CDP failed to provide dozens of additional Internal Affairs investigations. It failed to provide final dispositions for every civilian complaint, including complaints filed two years ago. It failed to provide Taser firing histories. Should I go on? If document-shredding Enron were still around today, even they would say of CDP's document retention policy: ""Come on, guys. Get it together."" 5. Basic mistakes and failures . The report found tactical errors and a failure to follow basic, generally accepted techniques for responding to an armed suspect. In one such case in 2011, officers failed to control the scene, failed to designate locations from which officers could seek cover and contain the threat, failed to use a negotiator, and grouped together with little or no cover. Look for critics to point to these findings as support for the proposition that the CDP's response to the Rice call was bungled. These are just a sampling of the findings by the Justice Department. The actual report contains other procedural concerns and is worth a long read. DOJ and Cleveland have now committed to developing a consent decree. This time, it will include an independent monitor and be court-enforceable. In the past several months citizens have repeatedly demanded, and expected, the intervention of federal law enforcement in these alleged cases of excessive force. This shows how embedded the idea of federal review is among the public. But the Constitution never provided for the federal government to review local police practices -- that jurisdiction was created by Congress, and really not that long ago. If not for that legislation, the police would ultimately only be policed ... by the police.","Justice Dept. found a pattern of unnecessary use of force by Cleveland cops .

"Secretary of State John Kerry is postponing a visit to the Middle East to give Egyptian efforts at negotiating a cease-fire between Israelis and Hamas a chance to take root, several senior U.S. officials tell CNN. Kerry was to travel from Vienna -- where he was negotiating a deal with Iran and world powers over Iran's nuclear program -- to Egypt and Qatar in the coming days to lay the groundwork for a possible cease-fire between the two sides. On Monday,  Egypt called for a cease-fire to stop the bloodshed and to project the innocent. ""Egypt shall receive guarantees from both sides of their commitment to implement what has been agreed upon, and shall follow up on its implementation and engage with either side in the case of any action that impinges on its stability,"" the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement. One official said the United States wants to give Egypt a chance to reassert itself as a power broker the Middle East, as it did during the 2012 cease-fire. The United States sees the election of President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi as a positive development in terms of Egypt playing a constructive role in the conflict, because Obama administration sources say that North African nation now is viewed as less conciliatory towards Hamas than it was under former President Mohammed Morsy. Kerry will allow a few days for diplomatic efforts to lay any groundwork, officials said, and is still prepared to either travel to the region if any cease-fire does not take hold, or to help support it if it does. Israeli officials tell CNN their military operations have made inroads to degrade Hamas' capability, now see some potential in the Egyptian proposal, and are willing to test it and see if a cease-fire can be reached. By Monday, the death toll from about a week of Israeli airstrikes had reached 186 -- all of them Palestinians -- with at least 1,390 wounded, according to Palestinian health authorities. No Israelis have been killed in the rocket attacks, though there have been some injuries. If a cease-fire takes hold on Wednesday, the Egyptians have called for Israeli and Palestinian delegations to travel to Cairo for negotiations in the coming says. The cease-fire talks are not expected just to address just a cessation of hostilities and related security issues, but also the humanitarian situation and Palestinian concerns -- such as addressing re-opening the Rafah border crossing between Egypt and Gaza, Palestinian fishing rights, salaries for Palestinians in Gaza and the eventual disarmament of Gaza. The goal, officials from Egypt, the United States and Israel said, is to put the pieces in place to a cease-fire that endures and includes preventing Hamas's inability to re-arm and continue rocket fire. Israel has made clear that it will only consider a cease-fire if the pieces are in place to make sure that it is a lasting and durable calm. The Egyptian cease-fire proposal calls for ""Palestinian factions"" to negotiate with Israel. American, Egyptian and Israeli officials say those factions are to include members of the Palestinian Authority in an effort to empower President Mahmoud Abbas as the legitimate representative of the Palestinian people. The officials say they don't want Hamas to be the ones gaining politically from a cease-fire, as it has in the past. Senior Israeli officials say the Egyptian proposal is being taken very seriously; however, a Hamas spokesman described it as a ""joke."" ""We did not receive this declared paper from the Egyptians ... which means it's an initiative for the media. It's not a political initiative,"" said Osama Hamdan. Speaking on CNN's ""The Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer,"" he continued: ""It's not really an initiative. It's not really an idea, what they are trying to do is to corner the Palestinians and to help the Israelis more."" Chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erakat was more optimistic, saying he is hopeful that ""we may see some real, real serious signs of a possible cease-fire in the next 12-24 hours."" ""I know that some other leaders in Hamas have said we are not closing any doors for any initiative for a cease-fire,"" he said. President Barack Obama Monday welcomed Egypt's proposal, saying he hoped it ""will restore the calm that we've been seeking."" One of the goals of the cease-fire is to address some of the issues surrounding the lack of Palestinian unity, with the ultimate goal of having the Palestinian Authority be the ruling authority over Gaza. One complication is the regional rivalry between Egypt and Qatar, which has close ties with Hamas and is looking to play a role negotiating a cease-fire. While U.S. officials say they think that Qatar could play a helpful role given their close ties to Hamas,  they need to balance that role carefully so as not to alienate others in the region, including Egypt, who are wary of Qatar. Qatar can also help pay Palestinian salaries, but the U.S. officials say they don't want Qatar propping up Hamas financially.","On Monday, Egypt called for a cease-fire to stop the bloodshed, protect the innocent .

"Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, hit back at Sen. Al Franken, D-Minnesota, Monday for his comments that Cruz doesn't know what he is talking about when it comes to net neutrality. Cruz used a video that he uploaded to YouTube and social media that shows the senator explaining what net neutrality is and how it works. ""What happens when government starts regulating a service as a public utility? It calcifies everything. It freezes it in place,"" Cruz says, in a clip from a speech he delivered Friday in Texas. ""Let's give a simple contrast. The Telecommunications Act of 1934 was adopted to regulate these,"" Cruz says holding up a landline phone. ""To put regulations in place and what happened? It froze everything in place. This (Cruz puts his hand on the landline phone) is regulated by Title II. This (Cruz holds up a cell phone) is not."" ""Your smartphone, the Internet, the apps -- all of this is outside of Title II,"" Cruz continues. ""The innovation is happening without having to go to government regulators and say, 'Mother, may I?' We want a whole lot more of this (Cruz holds up a cell phone) and a whole lot less of this (Cruz points at the landline phone)."" The Cruz explainer video is titled ""How net neutrality hurts the internet explained."" It was circulated in response to Franken's suggestion on Sunday that Cruz doesn't know what he's talking about when it comes to net neutrality. Franken, who chairs the Subcommittee on Privacy, Technology and the Law, said Cruz's previously stated analogy that net neutrality is like ""Obamacare for the Internet"" makes no sense. ""He has it completely wrong and he just doesn't understand what this issue is,"" Franken told CNN's Candy Crowley on Sunday. Net neutrality protesters sing, chant at FCC chairman's home . At issue are proposed ""fast lanes,"" or opportunities for big companies to pay Internet providers more money to make their websites operate at a quicker speed. But opponents, including President Barack Obama, favor keeping things equal -- also known as net neutrality -- so that wealthier businesses don't have an advantage over smaller ones when it comes to paying for faster websites. ""Obamacare was a government program that fixed something, that changed things,"" Franken said. ""This is about reclassifying something so it stays the same. This would keep things exactly the same that they've been."" To prevent ""fast lanes,"" Obama urged the Federal Communications Commission to implement more regulations -- something Republicans don't want. Obama puts foot down: No Internet fast lanes . Cruz said last week on Facebook that net neutrality is ""the biggest regulatory threat to the Internet."" ""In short, net neutrality is Obamacare for the Internet,"" he continued. ""It puts the government in charge of determining Internet pricing, terms of service, and what types of products and services can be delivered, leading to fewer choices, fewer opportunities, and higher prices for consumers."" Responding to Franken's comments, Cruz's communications director said Monday that ""allowing the government to regulate the Internet as a public utility would freeze innovation and prevent progress."" ""It's radical and extreme to put the future of the Internet in the hands of a five-member FCC panel influenced by lobbyists and politicians and unaccountable to regular, working Americans,"" Amanda Carpenter said, while also pointing to a recent speech by Cruz about net neutrality.","Sen.

"(CNN) -- Washington and Tehran didn't reach the final nuclear deal they were striving for, but the short-term extension of talks announced Monday should help ensure more progress can be made, both in preventing a nuclear-armed Iran and reducing the chances of yet another war in the Middle East. True, significant gaps remain to be bridged between the United States and Iran, and it is clearer than ever that nuclear diplomacy is not a sprint but a marathon. Yet these negotiations are worth persevering with, not just because we are on the brink of a diplomatic solution to the impasse over Iran's nuclear program, but also because of the potentially far-reaching impact on stabilizing the Middle East. Remember, Iran has enough power in Syria to reduce the bloodletting -- or to intensify the war. The Islamic State of Iraq and Syria's recruiting base depends in part on atrocities being committed by the regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to continue to grow. Iran's unmatched influence over the Assad regime therefore makes it a critical player in negotiating a political solution to Syria's civil war. As Staffan de Mistura, the U.N. special envoy to Syria, pointed out, ""Iran is an important player and I hope a partner in what should be a political process."" Both of de Mistura's predecessors, Lakhdar Brahimi and Kofi Annan, as well as U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon have also pressed for Iran's inclusion in negotiations to end the Syrian civil war. The United States has long insisted that Iran must first sign the Geneva Communique before it is permitted a seat at the table in the Syria negotiations. The Geneva Communique is the preliminary accord calling for a ""transitional governing body"" to rule Syria, which was signed at the first international negotiations over Syria's future. While Tehran has refused this precondition, Iran's participation in the talks may be the only way to secure even the most limited ceasefire agreement. The transitional governing body called for by the preliminary agreement may never come into being without Iran's buy-in. Strained relations between the United States and Iran make that buy-in from Tehran nearly impossible. The recent thaw, however, offers hope. The Iran Project recently released a report by more than 30 national security experts concluding that there is ""a strong link between settling the nuclear standoff and America's ability to play an effective role in a rapidly changing Middle East, and that a nuclear agreement will help unlock the door to new options."" The bipartisan signatories include two former U.S. ambassadors to Israel, Thomas Pickering and Dan Kurtzer, as well as pre-eminent national security advisers Brent Scowcroft and Zbigniew Brzezinski. The nuclear deal could help unlock the door to a political solution to the Syrian civil war, a prospect raised in the report. The authors rightly noted, for example, that ""the inclusion of Iran would be a crucial addition that would increase the possibility of success"" to relieve the immediate humanitarian crisis and develop a long-term political solution for Syria's future. Indeed, the report went as far as to say that, because Iran is so influential in the Syrian civil war, ""another international meeting would be fruitless"" if talks don't include Iran as well as the Syrian government. So long as Iran is part of the problem in Syria, engagement with Tehran has to be part of a solution. That is not to say that engaging Tehran to address the Syrian crises will be a quick fix for the brutality of either ISIS or the Syrian regime. Iranian hard-liners in high places are intent on providing a military lifeline to the Assad regime. The power struggle between the hard-line Revolutionary Guards and Iranian President Hassan Rouhani's more moderate faction is alive and well -- and the hard-liners currently control Iran's Syria policy. Finally, a nuclear accord may also help tip the balance in internal Iranian politics, with a breakthrough likely to shore up Rouhani's pro-engagement platform, providing a greater incentive for the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, to relinquish some control of Iran's foreign policy to Rouhani's more moderate camp. Ultimately, there is far more at stake in the ongoing talks with Iran than just the crucial nuclear issues being discussed. ISIS thrives on slaughter in Syria, but a political solution for the war-ravaged country has so far proven elusive. A final accord to rein in Iran's nuclear program could bring diplomatic options to stabilize the Middle East that were never previously on the table.","Jim McDermott and Kate Gould: Diplomacy in Iran nuclear talks a sprint, not a marathon .

"Look at the letters in these words. Really look at them: the shape of the circle that makes the ""o"" and the roundness of the ""c."" Look at how wide and tall they are. Look at the spaces between them. How do the lowercase letters make you feel? HOW ABOUT THE CAPITALS? A lot of consideration goes into designing a font, but somehow we're all able generally to accept the typefaces around us, ignoring their subtle design quirks as though they're as ordinary as air. We read their content but don't think too much about their form. In this way, the Helvetica font has established itself. There's even a movie about it -- the 2007 documentary ""Helvetica."" One of the people responsible for the popular use of Helvetica, Mike Parker, died Sunday at age 84. His son, Harry Parker, considers his father to be the ""godfather"" of the Helvetica font, as a Fast Company headline described him. ""My dad didn't draw Helvetica, but he was very instrumental in it,"" Harry Parker said. Many different companies use corporate logos inspired by Helvetica. The typeface is clear, legible and ""good for everything, pretty much,"" Massimo Vignelli, a designer, said in the ""Helvetica"" film. Words printed in Helvetica tell you what stop you're at on the New York subway. You might also see it in house numbers and tax forms. Interviewed in ""Helvetica,"" Mike Parker praised the ""firm"" quality of the font and the way that the spaces between characters ""just hold the letters."" ""It is not a letter that's bent to shape; it's a letter that lives in a powerful matrix of surrounding space,"" he said. ""It's -- oh, it's brilliant when it's done well."" Helvetica was born as ""Neue Haas Grotesk"" in 1957, a collaboration between Max Miedinger with Eduard Hoffmann, for the Haas Type Foundry in Münchenstein, Switzerland. The original, pre-digital font is different from what we know today. In the post-World War II era, design was seen as part of a movement toward social responsibility, openness and reconstruction, design writer Rick Poyner said in the film. Swiss designers in the 1950s were pushing the idea of ""rational typefaces"" for information that would ""present those visual expressions of the modern world to the public in an intelligible, legible way,"" Poyner said. Linotype machines were commonly used in printing at that time. Mike Parker comes into the Helvetica story as the director of typographic development at Mergenthaler Linotype Co. ""He oversaw its development into a font published for the Linotype machines,"" Harry Parker said. Under his leadership, more than 1,000 typefaces, including Helvetica, were added to the company's library, which became an industry standard. Parker made a name for himself by bringing fonts to the world, while his original career path might have unearthed rocks and minerals. Born in London in 1929, Mike Parker had intended to become a geologist, like his father, Harry Parker said. He then turned to painting but discovered that he was colorblind. ""What does a colorblind painter do? Type is black and white so that was the logical direction to go in,"" Harry Parker said. Parker graduated from Yale University with an undergraduate degree in architecture and master's in design. He got a job at the Plantin-Moretus Museum in Antwerp, Belgium, a museum with an extensive historical typography collection, and ""that's where Mike fell in love with the whole thing,"" font designer Matthew Carter said. After Linotype, Carter and Parker formed a company called Bitstream in 1981, the first company dedicated to producing digital fonts, ex-wife Sibyl Masquelier said. Parker also founded a company called Pages Software in 1990, which featured a word processor developed on the NeXTSTEP operating system, developed by Steve Jobs' early company NeXT Computers. Pages was in the beta stage when NeXT was discontinued in 1995, Masquelier said. Apple later named a word-processing program Pages. Parker additionally served as the historian for the Font Bureau, a typeface design foundry. He would often bring conversations back to typography, Masquelier said. She remembers him complaining about how fonts he had once overseen were being used on trucks, or how ugly other typefaces looked in magazines. ""He hated the fonts that looked like they had a machine gun shooting them,"" she said. ""Mike was all about classy style.""","Mike Parker, who helped make Helvetica famous, died Sunday at age 84 .

"(CNN) -- French Prime Minister Francois Fillon has apologized to his opposite number in New Zealand, John Key, over the recent ""unacceptable behavior"" of France rugby center Mathieu Bastareaud. Bastareaud has now been hospitalized after the furor surrounding his false claim of assault in New Zealand. The 20-year-old Stade Francais player, who is the cousin of Arsenal defender William Gallas, has been hospitalized with psychiatric problems after lying over an alleged assault outside the team hotel in Wellington -- following France's 14-10 defeat against the All Blacks on June 20. Fillon told Key in a letter: ""France's tour of New Zealand has been marked by the unacceptable behavior of one of our players. ""Our two countries share the culture of rugby. This sport has always allowed us to meet and to share a mutual respect. I hope that these sentiments will continue after this regrettable affair."" Bastareaud's claim that he was attacked by four or five men outside the hotel shocked New Zealand and led to an apology from Key. But video evidence showed the player had entered the hotel on Sunday morning uninjured and had gone into his room 25 minutes later. Meanwhile, Bastareaud, who was admitted to hospital on Monday, received support from the French players' union Provale. ""We, professional rugby players, lend our friendship and support to Mathieu Bastereaud and his family,"" Provale said in a statement. French Rugby Federation (FRF) president Pierre Camou also offered his apology to New Zealand over the affair that blighted France's All Black tour. A FRF statement declared: ""To be an international carries with it responsibility as a representative of your country and your federation. ""The FRF is shocked that one of the French team has lied. The New Zealand nation and the world of rugby can legitimately feel wounded by the player's initial statements which have also tarnished the image of French rugby."" Bastareaud returned home early from the tour to treat his facial injuries as the rest of the French squad travelled on to Australia and on his return issued an apology saying he believed he had to tell the truth following the media furore. He said that instead of being assaulted he had in fact sustained the bruises to his face after a drunken fall in his hotel room. Bastareaud, who had been due to go on a family holiday to the Caribbean this week, is expected to stay in hospital for at least a fortnight under observation.","French Prime Minister Francois Fillon apologizes to New Zealand counterpart .

"In his memoir, ""The Long Run,"" Mishka Shubaly chronicles his journey from ""irreverent young drunk"" to ultra-runner. The author sobered up by running five miles at a time, then 10, then 50. It was Shubaly's editor who first suggested he write about his road to recovery. ""I told him point-blank, 'No one wants to hear me cry about how I f***ed up my own life,' "" Shubaly said. ""And I was totally wrong."" When ""The Long Run"" was published on Amazon's Kindle Singles list in 2011, it hit No. 1, bumping Stephen King out of the top spot. The book's popularity may have been a surprise to Shubaly, but experts know he's not alone in using exercise to overcome addiction. Groups have been popping up around the country to help people stay sober by staying active. ""It's a great way to introduce people into something that then later becomes ... sort of their coping mechanism, as opposed to picking up a drink or a drug,"" said Scott Strode, one of this year's top 10 CNN Heroes. Strode's nonprofit, Phoenix Multisport, provides free athletic activities and a sober support community to thousands of people in Colorado. In 2008, the National Institute on Drug Abuse pledged $4 million to research the effect of physical activity on drug use. Preclinical research has provided evidence that exercise can help treat -- and even possibly prevent -- addiction, and now human trials are taking place. According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse, abuse of illicit drugs and alcohol contributes to the death of more than 100,000 Americans every year. While intervention and treatment programs have improved, relapse rates range from 60% to 90% in the first year of sobriety, the institute said. ""Habits play an important role in our health,"" the institute's director, Dr. Nora Volkow, said in a National Institute of Health newsletter. ""Understanding the biology of how we develop routines that may be harmful to us, and how to break those routines and embrace new ones, could help us change our lifestyles and adopt healthier behaviors."" Psychology professor Mark Smith researches the effects of exercise on addiction in laboratory rats. One of his first preclinical studies on the subject showed lab rats that had access to an exercise wheel in their cage were much less likely to self-administer cocaine than their sedentary counterparts. He and his colleagues have also completed several follow-up studies, duplicating the results with male and female rats; with low, medium and high doses; with heroin; and with different models of substance binges and relapses. ""I was amazed at how consistent the effects of exercise were,"" Smith said. Other researchers have published animal studies with similar results. For example, a 2009 study in Pathophysiology Journal showed treadmill exercise reduced morphine use in male rats. And in 2011, a study in the journal Current Neuropharmacology demonstrated animals' preference for saline over amphetamines when they exercised. ""These results lead us to conclude that a previous practice of regular physical activity may help in preventing amphetamine addiction,"" the study's authors wrote. While evidence mounts that exercise may help prevent and treat addiction, scientists are trying to figure out why. To get clean, addicts often give up their past social lives, including any friends who use. During their recovery, they have a lot of free time and not a lot of support. Exercise and sporting groups could help fill that void, said Richard Brown, a professor of psychiatry and human behavior at Brown University and director of addictions research at Butler Hospital in Providence, Rhode Island. When Brown and his colleagues started their human study on exercise and alcohol abuse, they theorized that physical activity would reduce the depressive symptoms alcoholics often suffer from, thereby reducing the risk of a relapse. They asked one group of study participants to work out once a week with the rest of the group and to work out on their own another two to three days. At the end of a three-month follow-up, the researchers found the exercise group had fewer drinking days and fewer heavy-drinking days than a group that didn't exercise as regularly. What the researchers didn't expect was feedback from participants who said they enjoyed the structure that regular exercise provided to their lives. ""They liked the fact that they were getting healthy and doing something for themselves,"" Brown said. Exercise provides a ""high"" that could be important for addicts trying to combat cravings, experts say. In addition to decreasing anxiety and stress, physical activity helps increase levels of dopamine in the brain. Dopamine, a chemical that's associated with feelings of pleasure, is often diminished over time by substance abuse. Some researchers have hypothesized that addicts are simply replacing one addiction with another. Smith's response? Fantastic. ""One of those addictions leads to basically a devastation throughout all aspects of your life and probably premature death,"" he said. ""The other addiction leads to improved cardiovascular health, better self-esteem, better self-efficacy and maybe some joint problems when you get older. It's an apples-and-chain saws comparison."" Brown has more theories on why exercise may help addicts stay clean. In unrelated studies, exercise has been shown to regulate sleep, a common problem for addicts early in recovery. It can even improve cognitive function, something that's often impaired by chronic substance abuse. ""These are just hypothetical,"" Brown said. ""They need to be tested."" While scientists search for more answers, Shubaly said he is content knowing that running works to keep him sober, day in and day out. ""For me, exercise is the opposite of alcohol,"" he said. ""Alcohol is the easiest, fastest and most effective way of saying: 'I don't care. I don't care about the good things in life or life at all.' ""Exercise, especially for someone who has been a sedentary alcoholic for a long time, is brutally difficult. And, as such, it's a very meaningful way of saying: 'OK, I actually do care now. I care a lot. I care enough about my life that I am willing to endure this torture to get better.' ""Doing the hard work of exercising totally reversed my worldview.

"A New York family's hope for an enjoyable outing high atop Manhattan ended abruptly when the group was escorted out of the Empire State Building for saying Muslim prayers, according to a lawsuit. Fahad Tirmizi, his wife, Amina, and their two young children were at the skyscraper's observation deck last July 2 shortly after 11 p.m., a time when the family's ""religious beliefs require them to recite the evening prayers wherever they may be at the time,"" according to a lawsuit filed in Manhattan District Court on Tuesday. The couple silently knelt in an isolated area of the observation deck, with little foot traffic, the court document said. While she managed to pray without incident, one guard interrupted and ""menacingly poked"" Fahad Tirmizi ""with his hands and feet several times in various parts of his body,"" the court document said. The guard informed Tirmizi he was not allowed to pray while at the observatory, and then ""forcibly"" escorted his family to the ground floor exit of the building, according to the court document. The suit names the Empire State Building management company, the building, the security firm, and two unnamed security guards as defendants, alleging that they violated the first and 14 Amendments as well as multiple state and city civil rights laws. The building is owned by a publicly traded company called Empire State Realty Trust. The family is seeking unspecified monetary damages. In response, an Empire State Realty Trust spokeswoman, Brandy Bergman, told CNN Wednesday, ""The claims are totally without merit and we will respond to them in court."" Phillip Hines, a lawyer for the the family, told CNN, ""an unwritten rule or policy was being enforced by security when they removed these people."" ""They weren't bothering anybody, they were out of the way, and for them to be thrown out of the building is just an ignorant and shameful exercise in discriminatory conduct,"" Hines said. The couple was ""shamed, humiliated and embarrassed in front of each other, their children, and the general public,"" according to the lawsuit. The family released a brief statement through its attorney. ""We weren't doing anything wrong, we just wanted to enjoy the view like everyone else,"" the statement said. The alleged response to the incident drew criticism from other religious groups. Bill Donahue, president of the Catholic League, released a statement Wednesday, which read in part: . ""Muslims who pray in public, including in public accommodations, are simply exercising their constitutional rights. In play are two First Amendment rights: freedom of speech and freedom of religion. We hope that Hines investigates the extent to which security guards are expected to censor religious speech. We wish him, and this innocent Muslim couple, well.""","Muslim family claims it was ""humiliated"" for actions taken when it paused to pray atop skyscraper .

"It's a sunny afternoon at Modern Sky, one of China's most popular outdoor music festivals, and 21-year-old rapper Yu Jialang is making his first appearance. Hands held high, excited fans crowd the stage to cheer for Yu, who describes himself as ""the baddest boy"" from his neighborhood, as he busts rhymes in Chinese. ""I make good stuff but I never imitate. Let me tell you a lil' something about the hood I come from. Listen up."" Yu is a Beijing university student majoring in drama and film literature, but his true passion is hip-hop. He wants to become one of China's few professional rappers. ""Everyone I know, who's really into rap music, will try to be a rapper,"" he says. ""It just feels natural for us to start rapping, to have the urge to make our own music."" Yu grew up in Dingfuzhuang, a small village that has become part of Beijing's urban sprawl -- a topic that informs his lyrics. ""Where I come from, there ain't no kind elderly playing chess in (the) cool shade,"" he rhymes in one song. ""Only gamblers playing poker and bag-snatching thieves."" Growing fan base . Yu has been playing gigs at local clubs since beginning of the year and has built up a fan base among young Beijingers. He also volunteers for a popular hip-hop radio show, ""Xi Ha Gong Yuan"" (the park), where he make occasional appearances, and promotes his music through Chinese social media platforms like Weibo and Wechat. Started by DJs Kong Lingqi 'Def Jef' and Wes Chen in 2006, the radio show has been actively promoting hip-hop culture in China and holds gigs to provide stages for local rappers to perform. This year, they teamed up with the organizers of Modern Sky to set up a stage especially for hip-hop artists.  China's music festivals are usually dominated by rock bands and folk singers. U.S. rappers like Eminem and 50 Cent have been popular since early 2000s but it was only after the Beijing Olympics in 2008 that home-grown hip-hop found a fan base. In 2008, Beijing-based rap group In3 brought hip-hop to public attention with their ""Beijing Welcomes You Back,"" a song dedicated to the Olympics. With its catchy rhymes and lyrics, the song went viral online soon after it was released. Individuality . College student Wang Dazhe, 20, has been fan of hip-hop music since high school and was Yu's back-up act at the festival. Wang says rap has become more popular among Chinese youth in recent years because his generation has been raised to pursue individuality. The genre allows them to express their emotions more directly than their elders. ""When I was in high school, I wanted to be different,"" says Wang. ""And hip-hop music is stimulating, it made me feel excited though I didn't understand much of the lyrics."" He first listened to legendary U.S. rapper Tupac Shakur. Now his latest favorite is Los Angeles-based Kendrick Lamar. But compared to U.S. rappers, Wang says he prefers Chinese artists. ""Chinese rap shares a similar form with hip-hop in the U.S., but they're quite different. Hip-hop in the U.S. now is more about entertainment."" ""Chinese rappers tend to tell stories of their everyday life, which I'm more emotionally attached to."" At the festival, crowd favorites were about city life -- the demolition of a historic building to a traditional local cuisine. In cities like Chengdu in China's southwest,  where residents prefer to use dialect rather than standard Mandarin, rappers use their local tongue. Underground genre . Kong believes hip-hop is getting bigger in China, with rap communities forming in cities across the country: . ""It's very much like hip-hop in the early 90s in the States where you have a lot of people that like the music and a lot of people that are making the music."" But unlike Chinese rock music, which enjoys tremendous mainstream popularity and huge commercial success, hip-hop still remains very much an underground genre. As Kong points out, its popularity hasn't really translated into record deals and profits, especially for young artists like Yu. ""Record companies (and) music festivals, they don't know hip-hop and they're not ready to gamble on hip-hop,"" Chen says, ""Because of that, the artists struggle."" Yu, who's in his last year of college, is willing to take a chance that the market for Chinese rap will blossom. ""While mainstream rappers, like Eminem, have a huge fan base. Underground rappers can also make a good living,"" he says. But he also knows it's going to be an uphill battle. ""I can just focus on making music and leave the rest to time and destiny."" Likewise, Kong and Chen are optimistic about the future of Chinese hip-hop. They believe there will be more opportunities for rappers and more people to enjoy the music, with the new stage at the Modern Sky festival just the start. ""We had the smallest stage, with the biggest crowd.""","Yu Jialang is one of China's emerging home-grown rappers .

Lyrics are often about social problems and city life .

"Oscar Pistorius did not commit murder the night he killed Reeva Steenkamp, a judge said Thursday. He did not intend to kill her, Judge Thokozile Masipa said. But his conduct was ""negligent,"" she said before adjourning for the day, suggesting she will find the Olympian guilty of culpable homicide. There is no minimum sentence for culpable homicide in South African law. It's up to the judge to decide. As he fired four bullets into the bathroom of his home in Pretoria on Valentine's Day last year, he did not foresee the ""possibility that he would kill the person behind the door, let alone the deceased, as he thought she was in the bedroom at the time,"" Masipa said. Evidence suggests that Pistorius genuinely believed the person in the bathroom was an intruder, although that is irrelevant to the case, the judge said. Pistorius could have taken other actions when he thought there was an intruder, she said. ""All the accused had to do was to pick up his cell phone to call security or the police,"" she said. ""He could have run to the balcony and screamed in the same way he screamed after the incident,"" she added, noting that Pistorius called security after the incident and could have done so when he heard what he thought was an intruder. Judge: Pistorius' background no excuse . Defense arguments that his upbringing ""in a crime-riddled environment and in a home where the mother was paranoid and always carried a firearm"" might explain his conduct that night, but ""it does not excuse the conduct,"" Masipa said. ""The accused had reasonable time to reflect, to think and to conduct himself reasonably,"" she said. ""I am not persuaded that a reasonable person with the accused's disabilities in the same circumstances would have fired four shots into that small toilet cubicle."" Following the country's legal standard for determining culpable homicide, Masipa found that ""a reasonable person"" would have ""foreseen the reasonable possibility"" that whoever was in the bathroom might have been killed, and would have ""taken steps to guard against that possibility,"" she said. ""I am of the view that the accused acted too hastily and used excessive force,"" she said, adding that under the circumstances, ""it is clear that his conduct was negligent."" Pistorius could be seen crying at times during the reading of the lengthy verdict. The Olympian's trial in the death of his model and law graduate girlfriend started six months ago, transfixing the world with graphic details of how he fatally shot Steenkamp. Before she rejected the premeditated murder charge, Masipa questioned why he fired ""not one ... but four shots"" into the bathroom before he went to find his girlfriend. However, she said, the intention to shoot does not necessarily mean the intent to kill. Judge: Pistorius knew right from wrong . ""Court is satisfied that at the relevant time, the accused could distinguish between right and wrong,"" and act accordingly, she said. Masipa cast doubt on witness testimony and said she believes media coverage contaminated testimonies. She doubted state witnesses, saying they were in and out of sleep the night of the killing. ""Technology is more reliable than human perception and human memory,"" she said. She described the victim's wound as ""immediately incapacitating"" and said she believed a scream heard by witnesses  the night of the killing was Pistorius,' not Steenkamp's. The judge appeared to be accepting the defense timeline of events that the shots came first, then screaming that must have been Pistorius. She knocked down some aspects of the state's case: the fact that Steenkamp took her phone and locked herself in the bathroom allegedly out of fear for her safety, phone messages between the couple that showed some rocky patches, and her stomach contents. Barry and June Steenkamp sat expressionless a few rows behind the man on trial for killing their daughter. Her father bowed his head as he heard about his daughter's fatal wounds. Pistorius' uncle, sister and brother also attended the hearing in the packed courtroom -- the latter in a wheelchair from a car accident. Lesser charges . Pistorius also faces three weapons charges. The most serious relates to ammunition found in his house when police searched it after the killing. He did not have a proper license for it, but he says he was storing it in his safe for his father. If he is found guilty of the ammunition charge, he could face up to 15 years in prison, though the judge could opt for a lesser punishment such as a fine or the loss of his gun license. Two other charges are related to allegations that he recklessly fired a gun in public -- once in a restaurant in 2012, and again out of the sunroof of a car last year. Pistorius denies both. The maximum penalty for each charge is five years behind bars. If he is convicted of either, he could face a lesser sentence, such as a fine or the loss of his gun license.","Oscar Pistorius' conduct was ""negligent,"" Judge Thokozile Masipa says .

"Christian Pastor Youcef Nadarkhani will be put to death for several charges of rape and extortion, charges that differ greatly from his original sentence of apostasy, Iran's semi-official Fars News agency reported Friday. Gholomali Rezvani, the deputy governor of Gilan province, where Nadarkhani was tried and convicted, accused Western media of twisting the real story, referring to him as a ""rapist."" A previous report from the news agency claimed he had committed several violent crimes, including repeated rape and extortion. ""His crime is not, as some claim, converting others to Christianity,"" Rezvani told Fars. ""He is guilty of security-related crimes."" In a translated Iranian Supreme Court brief from 2010, however, the charge of apostasy is the only charge leveled against Nadarkhani. ""Mr. Youcef Nadarkhani, son of Byrom, 32-years old, married, born in Rasht in the state of Gilan is convicted of turning his back on Islam, the greatest religion the prophesy of Mohammad at the age of 19,"" reads the brief. The brief was obtained by CNN from the American Center for Law and Justice and was translated from its original Farsi by the Confederation of Iranian Students in Washington. It goes on to say that during the court proceeding, Nadarkhani denied the prophecy of Mohammad and the authority of Islam. ""He (Nadarkhani) has stated that he is a Christian and no longer Muslim,"" states the brief. ""During many sessions in court with the presence of his attorney and a judge, he has been sentenced to execution by hanging according to article 8 of Tahrir -- olvasileh."" Rezvani, the official from Gilan province, confirmed that his execution is ""not imminent"" nor is it final. Mohammadali Dadkhah, the pastor's lawyer, said through a translator that even in light of the Fars News report, he does not believe Nadarkhani will be put to death. ""The case is still in progress,"" Dadkhah said. ""There's a 95% that he won't get the death penalty. Yes, I still believe that."" Dadkhah spoke briefly of the trial proceedings, stating that he presented documents to the court that should be convincing, including documents from Shi'ite leaders that state the crime does not warrant the possible punishment. ""This is a legal process that should take its course, and it should stand, on its own merits. It should succeed,"" Dadkhah said. Nadarkhani, the leader of a network of house churches in Iran, was first convicted of apostasy in November 2010, a charge he subsequently appealed all the way to the Iranian Supreme Court. After four days of an appeals trial that started Sunday at a lower court in Gilan Province, Nadarkhani refused to recant his beliefs. That said, Rezvani -- echoing an earlier report from Fars -- insisted that ""Nadarkhani's crime and his death sentence have nothing to do with his beliefs. ""No one is executed in Iran for their choice of religion,"" he added. ""He is a Zionist and has committed security-related crimes."" The possible execution of Nadarkhani, based on an assumption it is tied to his Christian belief, has elicited responses from the highest levels of the United States government, too. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton released a statement Friday that said the United States stands with ""all Iranians against the Iranian government's hypocritical statements and actions."" The White House released a statement on Thursday, stating that Nadarkhani ""has done nothing more than maintain his devout faith, which is a universal right for people."" ""That the Iranian authorities would try to force him to renounce that faith violates the religious values they claim to defend, crosses all bounds of decency and breaches Iran's own international obligations,"" reads the statement. Leonard Leo, chairman of the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom, says a trial for apostasy in Iran is rare. According to him, this is the first apostasy trial since 1990. Nadarkhani's trial and his possible execution have engaged American Christians, as well. Todd Nettleton, spokesman for Voice of the Martyrs, a Christian organization that attempts to assist with persecuted and minority churches around the world, called the news of the new charges proof that international attention on the issue is working. ""They are feeling the attention, they are feeling the weight of the eyes of the world watching how they are treating this man,"" Nettleton said. ""I am dumbfounded, though, that at this stage in the game, this is what they would trot out."" Voice of the Martyrs manages a Facebook page that has brought a lot of attention to Nadarkhani's trial. With comments updated by the minute, thousand of people have taken to Facebook to spread the word about the pastor. In light of this news, Nettleton said the Facebook page would continue to be active. ""I think our first response will be prayer for pastor Youcef,"" Nettleton said. ""Prayer that justice will be done and that he will remain faithful no matter that the days ahead may bring for him.""","NEW: Iranian official calls Nadarkhani ""rapist ... guilty of security-related crimes""

"Horrific images of dozens of mutilated children's corpses in the village of Houla prompted a rare moment of unity on Sunday from the United Nations Security Council. Children shot, knifed, axed to death in Syria's Houla massacre, reports say . Even Russia, the staunchest defender of the Syrian regime on the council, signed on to a statement that condemned the Syrian government for its ""outrageous use of force against (the) civilian population."" What is Shaam News Network? But few Middle East watchers predict the atrocities in Houla will break the diplomatic deadlock that has cemented itself around Syria for the last 15 months. ""Nobody can see these images and not react,"" said Rami Khouri, a veteran analyst of the Arab world who lectures at the American University of Beirut in Lebanon. ""The problem is no one has figured out an effective way to get involved and bring this conflict to an end."" As part of a ruthless campaign to crush what started out as a peaceful protest movement, President Bashar al-Assad's security forces shelled cities, carried out systematic torture in prisons, and opened fire on opposition demonstrations and funerals.  The United Nations Human Rights Commissioner has repeatedly accused al-Assad's regime of carrying out crimes against humanity. Annan meets Syrian president al-Assad as crisis reaches 'turning point' It did not take long for Western governments to call for al-Assad's ouster.  But nearly 15 months after the uprising began, opponents have been unable to formulate a plan to dislodge the family that has ruled Syria for more than 40 years. ""We don't have any idea how to make these guys go away,"" conceded a high-ranking Western diplomat based in the region, who spoke to CNN on condition of anonymity. ""Read between the lines,"" the diplomat added. ""In the immediate future, there is not going to be a Western intervention in Syria."" As the body count in Syria mounted over the last year to more than 9,000 killed, many Syrian opposition members began calling for military intervention along the lines of the NATO bombing campaign against Libya's now-deceased strongman Moammar Gadhafi. Al-Assad's reign defined by violence . But analysts agree the American public has little appetite for involvement in another Middle Eastern conflict, as Washington has struggled to wind down lengthy wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Unlike Libya, where a number of high-level officials abandoned Gadhafi's regime, the Syrian government has succeeded in maintaining discipline at the highest government levels, even as it has been forced to cede entire towns and villages to the rebels. ""Partly it's Allawite solidarity,"" said Khouri, who was referring to al-Assad's Allawite minority sect, which holds a disproportionately large number of positions in the security forces and in government. ""Partly, these people all have blood on their hands and they sink or swim together.  If they try to break away, their families will get killed or shot. It's a combination of terrorism and solidarity."" ""The biggest problem is the regime in Syria is not that weak,"" argued Omer Taspinar, a Washington-based analyst with the Brookings Institution.  ""They still have a critical mass supporting them: the Sunni merchants, who see the world is not doing anything and that Bashar al-Assad can get away with murder."" Should the U.S. 'airdrop' millions of phones into Syria? While the rebellion has roiled through second-tier cities as well as broad swaths of countryside, Syria's economic powerhouse cities -- Aleppo and Damascus -- have largely remained under government control. Also, unlike Gadhafi, al-Assad has powerful regional allies in his corner: Iran, Russia, and, to an extent, China. Exploring the Russia-Syria link . ""The Obama administration doesn't really want a clash with Russia, China, or Iran in Syria.  That would negatively impact oil prices (in an election year),"" said Taspinar. ""Overall, the strategy coming from the White House is procrastinate, try to emphasize the diplomatic initiative, talk about helping the opposition, but do not really ratchet up rhetoric into full confrontation with Russia and Iran."" After initially rejecting armed rebellion against the government, the Syrian opposition has morphed into a patchwork of loosely coordinated rebel groups determined to bring down the Syrian president. But they have been woefully under-funded and poorly armed.  For months, demonstrators across Syria have chanted, ""Arm the Free Syrian army"" at protests that are filmed and then distributed around the world via YouTube. Over the past month, there have been signs that the rebels have gotten their hands on new sources of weapons, though no government will publicly admit to arming the fighters. Recently, the leader of a rebel band called the Green Idlib Battalion in northern Syria confirmed to CNN that the prices for rifles and ammunition had dropped in half. Timeline: Syria -- How a year of horror unfolded . Early Monday morning, the Green Idlib Battalion's commander, who goes by the nom-de-guerre ""Akil,"" claimed to have carried out an attack in coordination with other rebel groups against the town of Atareb near the northern city of Aleppo. ""We burned the town's police station and the city hall in order to force the security and armed forces out of this area,"" Akil said in a phone interview from the battlefield, as gunshots and explosions could be heard in the background. But rebel fighters and residents said the government retaliated with armored vehicles, artillery and rocket fire from helicopter gunships. As always, civilians paid the greatest price. ""As the regime's artillery was shelling our town, our home was destroyed and me and my brother were seriously injured,"" said Mohamed Haj Taha. He spoke to CNN by telephone from a hospital in Turkey, where he fled with his brother and five other wounded Atareb residents early Monday morning. Hours later, Haj Taha said doctors pronounced his brother Abdo dead. ""Now I'm in the hospital filling out paperwork after my brother's death,"" Haj Taha said. The growing specter of a civil war in Syria clearly has policymakers worried. ""There's genuine concern about it turning into a huge-scale civil war with no way to influence the outcome or pick the winner,"" said the Western diplomat. Opinion: Only Russia, China can stop the carnage . The Syrian government blames al Qaeda-linked groups for a series of devastating suicide bombings targeting the headquarters of security forces in Damascus and Aleppo. Recently, even some of the secular activists who participated in the first waves of protests against Damascus expressed concern about Islamist elements cropping up within the armed opposition. ""Last week I was driving out of the city and two armed guys with long beards stopped me and asked me whether or not I pray,"" said Mamoon, a teacher from the southern city of Dera'a, who asked only to reveal his first name for security reasons.  ""We don't want our revolution to transform into armed gangs that are out of control."" ""I'm scared of those who say they are rebels and then start to appear alongside the protesters, but then start dirty business like kidnapping people for ransom,"" a female student from Hama recently told CNN, on condition of anonymity. Opposition groups are clearly concerned about damage to their international image. At a recent weekly protest in the northern town of Binnish, demonstrators performed a choreographed demonstration holding up letters from the English alphabet that spelled out the sentence: ""We are not terrorists."" One of the only measures that rival members of the U.N. Security Council have been able to come to agreement on was the deployment of hundreds of U.N.military observers to Syria. The mission was denounced from the start by opposition groups. They accused U.N. special envoy Kofi Annan of brokering a cease-fire that gave the Syrian government diplomatic cover for more killing. ""The plan had a lot of deficiencies, but it was the only plan that the Syrians and the Russians would agree to,"" said Rami Khouri, of the American University of Beirut. ""The monitors are just monitors, they are not peacekeepers.  They have been an easy but I think unfair target."" Kofi Annan calls for accountability . The much-maligned monitoring mission does not have the numbers or the weapons to force Syrian combatants to stop fighting. It did, however, play a vital role revealing the terrifying scale of the Houla massacre, which left at least 49 children under the age of 10 dead. The Syrian government routinely prevents international news organizations like CNN from reporting in Syria and thereby being able to verify accounts of fighting and casualties. And as the Syrian government and rebels accused each other of killing the children, the U.N. observers visited Houla and swiftly published a report that concluded the Syrian army fired artillery and tanks into the town. Syria's ambassador to the U.N. later responded by accusing some Security Council members of launching a ""tsunami of lies"" against Damascus. There appears to be no immediate end in sight for Syria's grinding war of attrition.  Neither al-Assad nor his allies show any signs of backing down, and al-Assad's opponents are unwilling to risk direct intervention. Some analysts argue the current bloody stalemate is better than allowing Syria to become the battleground in a regional proxy war. ""This idea that somehow if the West intervenes, it will stop things from getting worse seems naive,"" said Taspinar, the director of the Turkey project at the Brookings Institution. ""It's a bad situation, but its not as bad as it would be if you had a proxy war erupt between Iran and Saudi Arabia in Syria, or between Iran and Turkey in Syria.  That would be a full-bore Sunni-Shia confrontation."" America's regional allies Turkey and Saudi Arabia are majority Sunni Muslim countries that increasingly find themselves at odds with Shiite Muslim Iran throughout the Middle East. The Western diplomat was left hoping for what he called ""a game-changer"" -- a coup or an assassin's bullet that would bring down the Syrian president. But, he conceded, ""That's what we hoped would happen for more than 10 years to Saddam Hussein.""","""We don't have any idea how to make these guys go away,"" a diplomat says of regime .
""In the immediate future,"" he adds, ""there is not going to be a Western intervention in Syria""
