"(CNN) -- Nigeria international defender Olubayo Adefemi has been killed in a road accident according to police in the Greek city of Kavala. Kavala police say Adefemi lost control of his car on the Engatia Highway on the outskirts of Kavala, in northern Greece early on Monday morning, colliding with the central reservation before landing in the opposing lane. The 25-year-old, who played at right back for Skoda Xanthi in Greece's Super League, was on his way to Thessaloniki Airport to catch a flight back to Nigeria to finalize plans for his forthcoming marriage, his manager Miguel Riera said, AFP reported. Police are continuing to investigate the exact causes of the crash. Nigeria football officials said they were devastated to hear of the death of Adefemi, who represented his country on five occasions. ""We are in grief, total grief. This has come on a day that we should be celebrating the Flying Eagles' defeat of world champions Ghana at the African Youth Championship,"" said Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) acting general secretary, Musa Amadu, AFP reported. ""But at this stage, we can only pray for a repose of his soul and that God should grant the family he has left behind and Nigeria's football family the fortitude to bear the huge loss,"" Amadu added, AFP reported. A statement issued by the Greek Super League also expressed its shock on hearing of the tragedy. ""The Super League and the entire Greek football family would like to express its deepest condolences and sympathy for the family of Olubayo Adefemi, who died tragically in a car accident,"" a statement by the Super League said, AFP reported. Adefemi represented Nigeria at the 2008 Beijing Olympics when they were runners up to winners, Argentina. He joined Skoda Xanthi last summer, scoring two goals in his 24 appearances.","Nigerian international Olubayo Adefemi killed in a car accident in Greece .

"(CNN) -- At least 40 people were killed and more than 100 hurt Friday in clashes between tens of thousands of anti-government protesters and security forces outside Sanaa University in Sanaa, the Yemeni capital, medical officials on the scene said. President Ali Abdullah Saleh announced that a state of emergency had been declared, and he expressed his ""deep regret"" over the casualties. An Interior Ministry official said both sides suffered casualties in the violence. The official would not be named because he is not authorized to speak to the media. Witnesses said the clashes began after government supporters and anti-government demonstrators threw rocks at each other. Security forces shot into the air and then into the crowd; they also fired tear gas to try to disperse the crowd, witnesses said. ""Orders had been issued earlier to all security apparatus to protect the protesters and the opposition, and to separate them,"" Saleh said. At the time the firing began, however, the two sides were far apart -- meaning security forces could not protect the protesters, Saleh said. He also said the protesters opened fire in an area that was full of people. ""Their protests have to be carried out in places away from houses of ordinary people, in order to prevent any friction between them and the people living in those areas,"" he said. ""Therefore we have today announced a state of emergency in all regions and the ban of any acts of armed violence in order to preserve the safety and security of citizens,"" he added. A spokesman for the Yemeni Embassy in Washington, Mohammed Albasha, called on senior security authorities to bring the perpetrators of Friday's violence to justice. Separate statements from France and the United States, however, called on the Yemeni government to allow peaceful protests, implying that they believe the Yemeni government was responsible for the deaths and injuries. ""It is now imperative to stop attacks by security forces and pro-government armed groups against individuals exercising their right of expression and demonstration,"" the French Foreign Ministry said in a written statement. ""We again urge the Yemeni authorities, as they have previously pledged to do, to protect peaceful demonstrators, to guarantee the civil and political rights, and to adopt concrete and credible measures reaching out to the aspirations of the country."" U.S. President Barack Obama also urged Saleh to stick to his pledge to protect peaceful demonstrations. ""The United States stands for a set of universal rights, including the freedom of expression and assembly, as well as political change that meets the aspirations of the Yemeni people,"" he said in a statement. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton released a statement Friday saying that the U.S. is ""alarmed by today's violence in Sanaa against anti-government protesters"" and that she joins Obama in ""condemning the violence."" The U.S. is ""seeking to verify reports that this is the result of actions by the security forces,"" Clinton said, adding that ""all perpetrators of violence should should be held accountable and brought to justice."" Amnesty International went further, saying the shootings were part of an ""apparently coordinated sniper attack"" on protesters. ""This appears to have been a sniper attack with security forces deliberately shooting to kill protesters from strategic vantage points,"" said Philip Luther, Amnesty International's deputy director for the Middle East and North Africa. Protesters were reportedly chanting anti-government slogans at a protest camp near Sanaa University when armed men in plain clothes, believed to be members of the security forces, started shooting live rounds from the top of nearby buildings, Amnesty International said. Members of the security forces also shot at protesters at street level around the same time, it said. The group said it heard from a witness that the shooting started from different buildings and continued for more than 30 minutes. Hamid al-Ahmar, a member of parliament and leader of Yemen's opposition Islah Party, also blamed the government. ""The attacks on protesters are unacceptable, and the end of the regime is near,"" he declared. ""Saleh has brought upon himself a life of disgrace after the killing of innocent protesters."" Yemen has been wracked by weeks of unrest, with thousands protesting Saleh's government. High unemployment has fueled much of the anger among a growing young population steeped in poverty. The protesters also cite government corruption and a lack of political freedom. The president has said he will not run for another term in the next round of elections. He also has pledged to bring a new constitution to a vote by the end of the year and transfer government power to an elected parliamentary system.

"SEOUL, South Korea (CNN) -- South Korea's Incheon International Airport has been voted the best in the world, according to a 10-month survey of airline passengers. Seoul's Incheon, pictured, edged out Hong Kong's International Airport and Singapore's Changi Airport. Incheon, located about 70 km (43 miles) from Seoul, often ranks among the busiest airports in the world. It boasts a golf course, spa, private sleeping rooms, a casino, and indoor gardens that, according to the airport's Web site, offer ""travelers an oasis of calm and tranquility permeated with the refreshing scent of pine."" It is no surprise then that the annual survey conducted by the British-based consultancy group, Skytrax, ranked Incheon the No. 1 airport. The survey asked 8.6 million passengers at 190 airports to rate the facilities based on their experiences at check-in, arrival, departures and transfers. Incheon edged out Hong Kong's International Airport and Singapore's Changi Airport -- but barely. ""At one stage, it looked possible there might be a dead-heat result between these top three airports,"" Skytrax said in a statement. The annual survey also judged airports on individual categories. Dubai International Airport in the United Arab Emirates came out tops for having the best duty-free shops, Hong Kong serves the best food, Helsinki-Vantaa in Finland is least likely to lose passengers' bags and Japan's Kansai International has the cleanest restrooms. The top 10 airports, according to the survey, are: .","Incheon boasts a golf course, spa, private sleeping rooms, casino, indoor gardens .

"Dallas (CNN) -- Wildfires that have raged through parts of Texas have killed a second firefighter. Elias Jaquez, 49, died Wednesday, 11 days after getting trapped in a fire and suffering burns, Cactus City Manager Steve Schmidt-Witcher said Thursday. ""We're a very small, tight-knit community.  Everybody knew Elias, knew his family,"" Schmidt-Witcher said.  ""It's having a definite impact."" Firefighter Greg Simmons died last Friday trying to extinguish the East Sidwynicks fire in Eastland County. Numerous firefighters have been injured, some seriously. Thousands of firefighters have been battling the blazes that have scorched more than a million acres in Texas since April 6. Dry, windy conditions remained in parts of Texas on Thursday, though in some areas, cooler temperatures and rain aided firefighters. ""We've been given a break in the weather,"" said April Saginor, spokeswoman for the Texas Forest Service.  ""Humidity is up and temperatures are down."" CNN meteorologist Sean Morris said thunderstorms are expected in the region this weekend, but they will drop little rain and the lightning could spark further wildfires. West Texas averages nearly 15 inches of rain a year, according to David Hennig, a meteorologist in Midland, Texas.  Over the past six months, just 13-hundredths of an inch of rain have been recorded in that part of the state. While October through March is typically the dry season, that amount of rainfall is far below what it should be, Hennig said. Palo Pinto County Sheriff Ira Mercer predicted the fires will long be remembered. ""This is an event that's going to mark time in our county's history,"" he said. ""It's something that's going to change forever the looks and the community itself. It will be life before the fire and life after the fire, it's that big a deal."" On Thursday, Gov. Rick Perry declared Friday through Sunday as Days of Prayer for Rain. He urged ""Texans of all faiths and religious traditions"" to pray for ""an end to this ongoing drought and these devastating wildfires,"" as well as the safety of firefighters, said a news release from his office. The tinder-dry landscape has provided no shortage of fuel:  On Thursday, the Texas Forest Service responded to seven new fires across 159 acres; Wednesday's four new fires covered more than 1,000 acres; Tuesday;s 10 new fires totaled more than 2,000 acres. Since January 1, the Texas Forest Service said, it has responded to more than 800 fires that have damaged some 5,000 structures across 1.4 million acres. The state has seen fires in 252 of its 254 counties since December 21, 2010. In addition to in-state crews, the Texas Forest Service is directing the efforts of more than 1,900 firefighters from 36 states.  That figure does not include volunteer fire department responders. Schmidt-Witcher with the city of Cactus said he has lived in Moore County for 16 years and never seen fires this bad. Jaquez was among the personnel fighting a brush fire south of Dumas on April 9 when two fire trucks got stuck.  The four firefighters abandoned their trucks and tried to run from the fire.  Three suffered smoke inhalation.  Jaquez was unable to get away and was burned. He was taken to a burn unit in Lubbock, Texas, but died Wednesday, leaving a wife and four daughters. Flags were flown at half-staff, Schmidt-Witcher said.

"Minamisoma, Japan (CNN) -- The scene of sheer devastation left by powerful tsunami waves looked sadly familiar: trucks slammed into houses, uprooted trees and downed power lines soaked in muddy water, while time stood still inside abandoned homes with unmade beds and scattered stuffed toys. It was the eerie combination of sounds that stood out as I surveyed a deserted village on this chilly Wednesday morning: Rustling of dangling tin sheets in gusty wind, my own breathing behind a face mask and the constant beeping of my Geiger counter. My colleagues and I had just entered the 20-kilometer exclusion zone, a radius Japanese authorities drew around the Fukushima Daiichi power plant and ordered some 78,000 residents evacuated in the early days of the crisis, now the worst nuclear accident since Chernobyl. The March 11 twin disasters of a 9.0-magnitude earthquake and the ensuing tsunami in northeastern Japan have resulted in the plant belching radioactive particles into the surrounding environment. Driving for two hours on winding highways from the Fukushima train station, we had passed through rural Japan's alternating scenes of snow-covered mountains and green valleys in full bloom -- until we reached a checkpoint with a big ""no-entry"" sign and flashing red lights. A friendly police officer, however, waved us through, after emphasizing the need to don face masks despite the relatively low reading on radiation. Our shoes tightly wrapped in paper booties, we finally stepped onto the soil inside the so-called hot zone, some 18 kilometers north of the stricken nuclear plant. With parts of the ground still wet from days of rain, we avoided murky puddles to minimize the risk of cross-contamination. The numbers on our Geiger counters fluctuated while the alarms -- with base level set low -- kept going off. Still, we faced no danger of being exposed to anything that would harm human health. Cars zipped by occasionally as residents were allowed in to check on homes and businesses, but the only other sign of life appeared to be farm animals -- a few cows, horses and chickens -- left behind that have grown gaunt. We noticed a lone young man in a blue jacket and jeans standing by a large pool of muddy water. Declining to reveal his name, the 34-year-old farmer told us, before the tsunami hit, the pool was a fertile rice field that his family had tilled for 150 years. ""I have lost my work and my home,"" he said, adding he had come back to retrieve some personal belongings. ""And I am scared about my health."" He said he doesn't trust government officials who say risks from radiation are low for local residents. His father wants to return, but he has other plans for the future. ""I may have to face the prospect of leaving my father behind and live faraway from here to start a family,"" he said. We wished the young farmer good luck and didn't linger long inside the exclusion zone as it started drizzling from the gloomy sky. As we exited the checkpoint, a news headline flashed on my phone: ""Japan to enforce nuclear evacuation zone."" After removing face masks and paper booties, we drove past a line of shuttered storefronts and stopped at the centuries-old Senryu temple just outside the 20-kilometer perimeter. Sweeping its immaculately kept ground -- complete with a sand garden and a fish pond -- was Shinkoh Ishikawa, a 58-year-old Buddhist monk who offers a rare sanctuary to a community ravaged by a succession of disasters. The government had advised residents between the 20- and 30-kilometer zones to move away or remain indoors. ""Religion is not something distant, it stays next to you,"" Ishikawa explained his decision to stay after seeing hundreds of bodies of tsunami victims cremated at the local funeral home without a proper Buddhist ritual. ""I hope people understand that death is not the end of one's life, but a revolving step where lives meet again."" Lighting a candle in the temple's main hall where eight boxes of cremated remains lay on a table, Ishikawa chanted prayers for the dead. But it's the tough and cheerful nature of the locals, he said, that has given him the best hope even as the nuclear fallout continues to unfold. ""We will rebuild,"" he said. ""I'm confident about that because we had done the same after the second world war.""","There is a 20-kilometer exclusion zone around the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear facility .

"Mexico City (CNN) -- Mexican officials are revealing details of a recently announced agreement that ends a 16-year trucking dispute between Mexico and the United States. U.S. President Barack Obama and Mexican President Felipe Calderon announced the agreement during a visit by the Mexican leader to Washington last week. The two leaders solved what had been a wrench in the gears of the North American Free Trade Agreement, which was signed in 1994. Under the agreement, U.S. and Mexican tractor-trailers were to be allowed to transport goods back-and-forth across the border beginning in 1995. But safety and security concerns spurred the United States to bar Mexican trucks on U.S. roadways. In response, Mexico retaliated with $2.5 billion in tariffs on a variety of U.S. goods. A pilot program in 2007 to get Mexican trucks on U.S. roads was de-funded. This time, Mexican officials said, in details that began to emerge over the weekend, the authorizations will be permanent. Unlike the failed pilot program, under the new plan there will be no limit to the number of companies who can participate and the trucks they can register for cross-border transport, said Dionisio Perez-Jacome, Mexico's Communications and Transportation Minister. There will be three phases to the program, he said. The first will be the application and inspection of Mexican trucks and the accreditation of their operators, Perez-Jacome said. This phase concludes with a provisional authorization being granted to enter the United States. The second phase starts with a three-month period of thorough inspections of the vehicles crossing the border, checks that will decrease starting the fourth month, he said. It concludes with a certification that the company is following all the rules. The last phase involves the Mexican companies being notified of their permanent authorization, which can be granted after 18 months of successful operations, Perez-Jacome said. This authorization can only be revoked if a safety regulation is broken. A binational commission will be created to monitor all the phases of the new program. ""This is a great step forward in our bilateral relations,"" Mexican Economy Minister Bruno Ferrari said. ""The solution to this conflict represents a substantial advance for regional competitiveness, and, without a doubt, will offer new business opportunities for Mexican truckers."" Currently, three trucks and three drivers are used to get goods across the border, Ferrari said. It comes out to about $150 per crossing. Multiplied by the 4.5 million annual truck crossings, the savings generated could exceed $675 million, he said. The agreement is expected to be signed by both presidents by June, at which time Mexico will drop half of its retaliatory tariffs, Ferrari said. The second half will be removed when the first permit for Mexican truckers is issued. However, Ferrari noted, Mexico reserves the right to re-introduce tariffs if any parts of the agreement are violated by the United States. Some in Mexico expressed concern that the U.S. Congress may block the agreement. Ferrari said that his understanding was that Obama was asking for a consultation period that would include Congress, but that the legislative body's approval would not be required. The flow of goods across the border exceeded $2.75 billion in 2010, which represents 70% of total trade between Mexico and the United States, Ferrari said. ""The agreement achieved will reduce the costs of transporting goods between both nations,"" he said.","Obama and Calderon announced the agreement last week .
It comes after 16 years of disputes .

"(CNN) -- Anything can still happen at the quake-stricken Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant at Japan, but experts are hopeful that the situation will stabilize. In the best-case scenario, electrical power and cooling would be restored to all of the six units of the plant, said Tom Kauffman, spokesman for the Nuclear Energy Institute, a policy organization of the nuclear energy and technologies industry in Washington. Restoring electric power is essential to stabilizing the plant, said Michael Golay, professor of nuclear science and engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Power would ensure that the water can be provided to cover the fuel. Workers hope to install a crucial panel at an annex building, which was not severely affected by last Friday's post-earthquake tsunami, for a new power supply system that should be finished Friday morning, an official from the Tokyo Power Company said Friday morning. The improvised power system, using 1.5 kilometers total of cable, is expected to provide electricity to power the cooling systems for the Nos. 1 and 2 reactors at the plant. Also, engineers got an emergency diesel generator for Unit 6 running, and it is supplying power to Units 5 and 6, Japan's Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency said Friday. Water injection to the spent fuel pool was continuing. ""Obviously what we're hoping for is that they will bring the various cooling problems under control in the very near future,"" said Ian Hutchinson, professor of nuclear science and engineering at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Once the fuel rods are submerged in water, the large releases of radioactive materials should come to an end, Hutchinson said. When the cooling water is restored to the spent fuel pools, and the reactor is cooling and the flooding can be maintained, expectations are for a stabilization of the situation, and a major reduction of radiation emissions, he said. ""That's when we'll be able to say, 'We've got this under control,'"" Hutchinson said. Once it's been under control for a week or two, things may stabilize. The whole cleanup would take a matter of months or even years, Hutchinson said. And the site won't be usable again, said Gary Was, professor in the department of materials science and engineering at the University of Michigan. Even in the best case scenario, there will be melted fuel in the reactor that's not going to be usable, Was said. A real concern is the after-heat arising in the fuel rods, which need to have water cooling them, Hutchinson said. Unless there are much bigger releases and contaminations near the site, people may one day be able to safely get closer to Fukushima Daiichi than the current established evacuation zones, Golay said. The United States government has instructed Americans to stay 50 miles from the plant; for Japanese citizens, the evacuation zone is only about 12 miles. ""The fact that you have differing policies doesn't mean the U.S. thinks it's more dangerous,"" Golay said. It's simply because the U.S. is not in a position to help its citizens in Japan, he said. The situation at Fukushima Daiichi is worse than Three Mile Island, the Pennsylvania plant that suffered a partial core meltdown in one of its reactors in 1979, Golay said. That's because at Fukushima Daiichi there's more radioactive material involved, and it's less contained he said. At the Chernobyl disaster, the world's worst nuclear power plant accident, which occurred in 1986, the facility had to be sealed off with a large concrete sarcophagus. It's hard to say whether this will need to happen at Fukushima Daiichi, experts say. It all depends on the extent of the contamination, which is unknown, Was said. Sealing off Three Mile Island was also discussed at the time of that disaster, Kauffman said, but instead the reactor was cleaned out, with the damaged fuel and core debris shipped off-site and put into storage. ""We're still in the wait-and-see mode,"" Kauffman said.","Experts: Restoring electric power is essential to stabilizing Fukushima Daiichi .

"New York (CNN) -- A Broadway actor injured when he fell more than 20 feet while performing a stunt in the ""Spider-Man"" musical is set to be released from a rehabilitation center this week, his father told CNN Sunday. Christopher Tierney, 31, was moved into the center after being discharged from New York's Bellevue Hospital on December 28. His father, Tim Tierney, said he isn't sure when his son will arrive at his Portsmouth, New Hampshire, home, but said he is scheduled to be released from the facility Wednesday. Christopher Tierney suffered four broken ribs; a hairline skull fracture; a broken scapula, or shoulder blade; a bruised lung; three cracked vertebrae; and broken bones below his elbow in the December 20 fall, the elder Tierney has said. Tim Tierney said his son is improving. ""He is up,"" he said. ""He is walking and just doing very well."" He said Christopher Tierney cannot wait to return to the show, ""Spider-Man: Turn Off The Dark."" Several of the shows were canceled following Tierney's fall, and new safety precautions were put in place before they resumed following a meeting between the show's company, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration and the New York State Department of Labor. The show, with music and lyrics by U2's Bono and Howell (aka The Edge), is the most expensive in Broadway history, but production has been beset by cast injuries and technical problems. Once Christopher Tierney is home, his family plans a belated Christmas celebration, Tim Tierney said. Jonathan Dealwis, a tourist from New Zealand, said he saw Tierney fall. ""Spider-Man was on a bridge, and Mary Jane was dangling from it,"" he said. ""I think he was meant to sort of swoop over there, but he just fell off ... the harness, you could see it just flick off his back and fly backward.""

"Washington (CNN) -- A leading Senate conservative said Sunday he can accept tax reform that increases overall tax revenue as part of a comprehensive deficit reduction plan. Republican Sen. Tom Coburn of Oklahoma told the NBC program ""Meet the Press"" that if lowering tax rates and eliminating loopholes and deductions ended up bringing in more money to the U.S. government, ""that would be fine with me."" Asked about a pledge he signed previously against any kind of tax increase, Coburn said his more important pledge was to do what's best for the country. He also noted that political reality dictated the need for bipartisan support for any agreement to pass. ""This isn't about politics as normal,"" Coburn said. ""It's about making a decision now that is urgent."" Coburn is one of six senators taking part in bipartisan talks on a deficit reduction blueprint. While they have yet to reach final agreement, the senators participating in the so-called ""Gang of Six"" want their work to serve as an impetus for both sides to meet somewhere in the middle on the deficit reduction issue. Another member of the Senate negotiators, Budget Committee Chairman Kent Conrad of North Dakota, told reporters that increased revenue must be part of a deficit reduction plan. As an example of the tax reform under discussion, Conrad told reporters the plan would limit the mortgage interest deduction to a maximum of $500,000 worth of mortgage and only on a principal residence, not a second home. Under current law, the amount of mortgage held by a married couple eligible for interest deduction is $1 million, and that can apply to a second home. The deficit reduction debate is central to two key spending issues coming up before Congress -- increasing the amount of money the government can borrow, and passing a federal budget for fiscal year 2012, which begins October 1. The U.S. debt is expected to hit the country's $14.3 trillion ceiling next month, though congressional leaders say the Treasury can take steps to put off the deadline until early July. Conservative Republicans are demanding significant deficit reduction steps attached to the debt ceiling measure before they'll vote for it. ""I will vote 'no' on raising the debt ceiling unless we have comprehensive, dramatic, effective and broad- based cuts to federal spending, including the reform of entitlement spending,"" Sen. Mark Kirk, R-Illinois, said on the CBS program ""Meet the Press."" President Barack Obama and Democratic leaders oppose linking the debt ceiling measure to political issues, warning that a failure to raise the debt limit would amount to a U.S. default that would shake global markets, raise interest rates and stall or reverse economic recovery. ""We will raise the debt ceiling because the alternative, as every expert economist agrees, would be catastrophic for our economy, for our credibility around the world, for the bond markets and for the world economy,"" Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut told CBS. ""So I think the only question is really whether raising the debt ceiling will be tied to spending reductions."" However, Coburn and Republican Rep. Joe Walsh of Illinois, a Tea Party conservative elected last November, rejected the Democratic argument that the debt ceiling must be raised, saying the government has enough money to pay its debt obligations, at least for a few months. ""It's being overstated,"" Walsh, speaking on the CBS program, said of Democratic warnings of potential economic catastrophe. ""Three or four times over the course of the last 20 years, Congress has voted not to raise the debt ceiling, and it's taken a few months and then they've come together and they've raised it,"" Walsh said. ""But over the course of those few months when the debt ceiling wasn't raised, Armageddon didn't hit. The government paid its bills. We've got enough government revenues to certainly pay -- to service all of our debt. And the administration knows that."" So far, House Republicans have passed a 2012 budget proposal that would slash nonmilitary spending and overhaul Medicare and Medicaid while lowering tax rates with no revenue increase. The GOP plan drafted by House Budget Chairman Paul Ryan of Wisconsin would cut deficits by more than $4 trillion over 10 years. Obama and Democrats reject the Republican plan as an imbalanced approach that would put the burden of deficit reduction on senior citizens and the poor. Instead, Obama proposes cutting deficits by $4 billion over 12 years through cuts in both military and discretionary spending, increasing the tax burden on families making more than $250,000 a year and adjusting the Medicare and Medicaid government-run health care systems for the elderly and the poor. The Gang of Six negotiations focus on a deficit reduction plan compiled last year by a commission appointed by Obama that calls for increased revenue through tax reform, spending cuts in all areas and reforms to all the entitlement programs. Asked if the Senate talks were approaching a consensus, Conrad told NBC: ""If we don't have an agreement soon, we won't be relevant to this discussion. ""We intend to be relevant,"" he said, adding: ""We have made enormous progress in this group, and it is the only bipartisan effort that is under way. And at the end of the day, it has to be bipartisan or nothing is going to happen.""

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- Seven areas of Afghanistanwill begin to be handed over to Afghan forces to maintain their security in July, Afghan President Hamid Karzai said on Tuesday. The announcement from the president marks the first step in NATO's long-awaited plan to hand over security to a series of provinces across the country, leading up to 2014 when it is expected that Afghan security forces will be in control of the whole country. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton welcomed Karzai's announcement. ""As we have long said, the Afghans themselves must take responsibility for their own future -- for providing security, for strengthening governance and for reaching a political solution to the conflict,"" Clinton said in a prepared statement. ""The United States continues to support the Afghan people as they work to build a more stable and peaceful nation, and we remain committed to the goal of a region that is free from Al Qaeda and no longer a safe haven for international terrorism."" Members of NATO also applauded the announcement. ""This represents the next stage of Afghanistan's journey,"" said NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen. ""We are committed not to leave any security vacuum that could breed extremism."" The ""transition is a process. It is not flipping a switch. Certainly Afghans will be in the lead but we are still here and will still help,"" said Lt. Col. John Dorrian, a spokesman for NATO's International Security Assistance Force. He said the decision to begin transitioning Lashkar Gah, an area in the restless province of Helmand, was a ""testament to the progress made in the south."" Areas to be handed over include parts of the capital Kabul. Southern regions such as Kandahar and Helmand provinces have long been major fronts in the war against the Taliban. In a speech last month,  Karzai talked about this upcoming transition. During that speech, Karzai credited the influx of 70,000 international forces in 2010 for improving the situation and helping Afghan security forces.

"Cairo, Egypt (CNN) -- A fire broke out in the Egyptian Interior Ministry on Tuesday in downtown Cairo following a protest earlier in the day. Flames could be seen on the roof of the multistory building, and a dark plume of smoke loomed over the city. People could be seen fleeing the building as it burned. The blaze was extinguished in under an hour. The ministry was the site of a peaceful protest Tuesday morning and afternoon, with thousands of ministry employees  -- many of them police officers -- making demands, mainly for higher wages. Protesters at the building denied setting the fire, saying it originated inside. During the protest, some of them could be seen climbing on guard posts and the building's roof. ""I suspect that an electrical circuit malfunction may have caused the fire because it started at the top floors of the police communication building inside the ministry,"" said Alla Mahmoud, Interior Ministry spokesman. ""The protesters did not enter."" He said uniforms and old furniture are stored on the top floors, which would explain the thick smoke. The cause of the fire was under investigation, he said, and findings will be announced Wednesday morning. Several firefighters suffered problems due to smoke inhalation, a Ministry of Interior spokesman said. Another man was rushed away from the building in an ambulance, but the cause of his injuries was not clear. Before the fire broke out, a procession of thousands of demonstrators made its way from the Interior Ministry through Cairo's Tahrir Square -- ground zero for protests that toppled longtime Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak last month -- and in the direction of the state television and radio offices. In a similar protest a few weeks ago, demonstrators set other buildings in the Interior Ministry complex ablaze, as well as cars. However, that fire did not grow to the size of Tuesday's blaze.

"(CNN) -- Co-hosts India set up a much-anticipated quarterfinal clash with four-time Cricket World Cup champions Australia on Sunday, beating the West Indies by 80 runs at Chennai. The victory meant India finished second in Group B, while Australia ended third in Group A after their 34-match unbeaten run at the 50-over tournament was halted by table-toppers Pakistan on Saturday. The Windies, who had already qualified for the last eight before the concluding match of the round-robin stage, will play Pakistan in the opening knockout game in the Bangladeshi capital of Dhaka on Wednesday. The Indians have home advantage in Ahmedabad the following day, then Group B winners South Africa take on New Zealand in Dhaka on Friday and Group A runners-up Sri Lanka host England in Colombo on Saturday. Yuvraj Singh scored his first World Cup century as India posted a total of 268 at Chidambaram Stadium, being bowled out in the final allotted over. He collected his third man-of-the-match award of the tournament after hitting 113 off 123 balls faced, adding 122 for the third wicket with Virat Kohli (59) and then later dismissing two West Indian batsmen with his left-arm spin bowling. However, India lost their last eight batsmen for just 95 runs as World Cup debutant Ravi Rampaul claimed five wickets for 51 runs. The 26-year-old fast bowler, who had played 50 one-day internationals before this call-up in place of Kemar Roach, made an impressive start as he dismissed India's opening batsmen Sachin Tendulkar (2) and Gautam Gambhir (22). World record-holder Tendulkar had been seeking to score his 100th century at international level, but walked off after edging a rising delivery despite the umpire rejecting Rampaul's appeal. The Windies, who would have faced Australia in the quarterfinals if they had won, made a solid start in reply but then suffered a batting collapse at 154-2 in the 30th over. Left-arm fast bowler Zaheer Khan bowled top scorer Devon Smith for 81, while spinner Harbhajan Singh accounted for big-hitting dangerman Kieron Pollard (1) as the last eight wickets tumbled for just 34 runs. Khan ended with figures of 3-26, while limited-overs specialist Yuvraj chimed in with 2-18 in his 271st one-day international outing. ""When you lose early wickets, you need a partnership going. I was very happy with the way it went,"" the 29-year-old Yuvraj told reporters. ""I was getting stomach cramps, but wanted to bat till the end. Our batting is going well -- once we get the bowling and fielding going we should be okay."" In Sunday's earlier Group A concluder, Zimbabwe finished on a winning note by beating fellow minnows Kenya by 161 runs in Kolkata, meaning their fellow Africans ended the tournament without a win. Zimbabwe scored 308-6 after batting first, with Craig Ervine top-scoring on 66 and Vusi Sibanda contributing 61, while Tatenda Taibu also made a half-century. The Kenyans crumbled to 147 all out in 36 overs, as slow bowlers Ray Price, Greg Lamb and Graeme Cremer each claimed two wickets.","India beat the West Indies by 80 runs to finish second in Group B at World Cup .

"(CNN) -- Ferrari's Fernando Alonso has told CNN Sport's Don Riddell that Michael Schumacher is still the fastest driver on the Formula One grid. Speaking ahead of the opening grand prix of the season in Melbourne, Australia, Alonso -- himself a double world champion -- believes that seven-time world champion Schumacher remains a cut above his rivals. ""If Formula One was 24 cars exactly the same, then Michael would be the driver I would fear most,"" revealed Alonso. ""If you look down the list of drivers on the grid for 2011, then one name stands out above the rest, Michael Schumacher. ""Michael is a seven-times world champion and is a legend in Formula One. We have to respect him because he has the ability and talent to do well this season."" Despite not winning the drivers' title since 2006, Alonso confirmed that should he retire without another championship to his name, he would still be more than happy with his career. ""Not many drivers have had the opportunity to win one world title, let alone two. I have already had nine years in Formula One and hopefully have another six or seven to come,"" added the Spaniard. ""I could spend nearly a quarter of my life in this wonderful sport, doing what I love to do, so I consider myself lucky and am very happy."" Despite this, Alonso confirmed that coming so close to his third world title last year, left him sad and frustrated. ""The first three or four days after the end of the season were not the best for me,"" Alonso confirmed. ""But I feel that Sebastian Vettel and Red Bull won the title rather than Ferrari losing it. ""Coming so close last year makes the team determined to go one better this time around,"" he added. ""Everybody at Ferrari was devastated by the result at Abu Dhabi last year but we are all very motivated now for 2011.""","Fernando Alonso tells CNN that Michael Schumacher is still the best F1 driver .

"(CNN) -- Some 20 years after his beating at the hands of Los Angeles police, Rodney King was pulled over in Arcadia, California, this week after allegedly running a red light, his fiancee said Thursday night. Cynthia Kelly said she was riding with King on Tuesday when the traffic stop occurred. King was then was cited for driving without a license, she said. Kelly was a juror in King's civil trial against the city of Los Angeles in 1994, in which he was awarded $3.8 million. Amateur video captured King's beating after Los Angeles police officers stopped him for speeding March 3, 1991. Police beat King repeatedly, delivering 56 baton blows and six kicks -- causing skull fractures, and brain and kidney damage. King talks to CNN about the 1991 beating . Four officers were charged with assault with a deadly weapon and excessive use of force but were acquitted of state charges on April 29, 1992. The three days of rioting that followed in Los Angeles and other U.S. cities left 55 people dead and 2,000 injured. There were 12,000 arrests and about $1 billion in property damage in Los Angeles. Two of the officers, Sgt. Stacey Koon and officer Laurence Powell, were later convicted of federal civil rights violations. Since then, King has had a handful of run-ins with the law, including a guilty plea in 2004 to driving under the influence of a controlled substance and reckless driving. In a recent interview with CNN's Don Lemon, King said he forgave the officers involved in the 1991 beating. ""I've been given a break many times in life, everybody's entitled to a break,"" King said. ""I didn't die, you know what I mean?"" CNN's Jeff Reid contributed to this report .","King is cited for driving without a license .

"(CNN) -- A spacecraft survived the closest encounter ever with a comet on Thursday, tracking it just 435 miles from the comet's nucleus. Mission control at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, broadcast live coverage of the event on NASA Television's Media Channel. Controllers broke into applause after hearing of the success. The agency's EPOXI Deep Impact spacecraft was expected to use two imagers and an infrared instrument to acquire data about a tiny comet named Hartley 2 as it traveled at speeds of more than 27,000 miles per hour. Scientists are still working to determine whether there was any damage to the spacecraft as the peanut-shaped comet passed by. They hope to learn to more about comets from five images detailing the close approach. ""Those early images may not be the 'money shot,' but we on the science team will prize them just as well, as they will help us further understand the nature of comets,"" said EPOXI principal investigator Mike A'Hearn of the University of Maryland, College Park, in a NASA statement. ""We certainly have our hands full. The images are full of great cometary data, and that's what we hoped for."" The images are expected to depict the comet nucleus as little more than a point of light with a fuzzy coma, a gaseous cloud, surrounding it. ""It was just incredible,"" Ed Weiler, associate administrator of the Science Missions Directorate for NASA, said of the encounter. Five years after NASA launched an 800-pound projectile into a comet in an effort to study its contents, the same spacecraft that launched the missile tracked Hartley 2 on Thursday. It is the first spacecraft to have visited two comets. NASA officials expressed hope that such missions will inspire young people to get into the field of space exploration.","Comet Hartley 2 passes just 435 miles from spacecraft .

"(CNN) -- Best-selling author Jennifer Egan is having, by all accounts, a great week. She won the Pulitzer Prize for her novel ""A Visit from the Goon Squad."" She made a deal with HBO to potentially turn the book into a TV series, and she won a spot on Time magazine's 100 most influential list. CNN talked to the author about her success. The following is an edited transcript. CNN: Congratulations on your Pulitzer Prize. It's a well-deserved honor. What were you doing when you received the news? Egan: I was just sitting down to lunch at a neighborhood restaurant when I heard the news. My first reaction was flat-out disbelief. I kept asking my publicist, ""Are you sure?"" It seemed impossible that a scrappy book like ""Goon Squad"" could win an award like that. It's such an iconic honor. I think what the Pulitzer means to me is that I'll need to work very, very hard to try to live up to it. CNN: How did ""Goon Squad"" come about? What was the genesis or idea that inspired you to write your latest award-winning novel? Egan: The entry point for me was very much what it is for the reader; I was in a hotel bathroom, looked down and saw a wallet lying exposed in a woman's bag. I've had my wallet stolen many times and ways in my life -- through carelessness, oblivion or just plain being a sucker -- and when I saw that wallet, I thought, ""Oh, no! Someone will take it!"" Since I was the only person in a position to so, my mind made one of the fictional leaps that I live for: Someone would take the wallet. Who? And why? I began writing from that moment, and the rest followed fairly intuitively; a peripheral character in one chapter would catch my eye, and I'd think, ""Who is that person? What does his or her inner world look like?"" CNN: Your novel is filled with interesting and unusual characters; do you ever base them on other people? Egan: I almost never use real people; in fact, I find that quite hard to do. So I feel as if I'm making everyone up, that they have nothing to do with me or my life. I think thinking that actually helps me to write about them. But I always need to identify with a character to write about him or her -- and by ""identify,"" I mean see the world through that person's eyes and have a strong sense of the inner logic of their acts and decisions, wacky or wrongheaded though they might be. In that sense, I think there's some of me in all of them. CNN: I have to ask about the PowerPoint chapter. It may be the most creative part of an already inventive book. What was behind it? Egan: I started wanted to try writing fiction in PowerPoint in the summer of 2008, after reading in an article about the Obama campaign's turnaround. A PowerPoint presentation within the campaign was credited with a change of strategy. In the old days, it would have been called a ""memo"" or a ""paper"" or even a ""presentation."" But now it was called a PowerPoint -- actually branded! That really struck me. I thought, ""could this ubiquitous program work for fiction?"" Still, there were obstacles to my using PowerPoint: I had never used it before, didn't own it or have enough memory on my laptop to hold it. So my first attempts at writing fiction in PowerPoint occurred by hand! Only months later, when I'd finally bought the program and begun to work in it, did I begin to suspect that what had really been driving me toward it all along was a sense that it could provide a kind of microcosm of ""Goon Squad"": a series of moments separated by gaps, or pauses, which add up to one story in the end. That chapter ended up feeling like the heart of the whole book. CNN: You've received widespread critical and public praise for your books. How much importance do you give to all the accolades and reviews of your work? Are you more interested in what your fans have to say? Egan: It's amazing to connect with fans, especially because I write slowly, and often with a sense that it will be a miracle if the book I'm working on is ever finished or publishable. Winning prizes is a new experience for me, and I'm especially hopeful that the prizes might help me find a wider audience for ""Goon Squad,"" which struggled in the marketplace early in its publication. But I'm also keenly aware that many, many worthy books don't win prizes, and that there's a lot of luck involved. I think I got very lucky with ""Goon Squad."" CNN: What prompted you to become a writer, and did you ever envision this level of success? Egan: I still don't envision this level of success! What has always driven me is a love of writing itself. I'm not a wildly gifted person; I don't play an instrument or speak another language or have great accomplishments in another field, as many writers do. But writing feels natural to me; the act of it seems to free up my unconscious, so that sometimes I feel that I have access to more ideas and information than my conscious mind could think up. I've known that writing was essential to me since I was about 18. Between high school and college, I took a year off, saved up money and went to Europe with a backpack in the summer of 1981. It wasn't easy being in my own company for several weeks at that age, but somehow it made me realize that I wanted to be a writer. CNN: Do you have a daily routine, a schedule or a ritual when you're writing a book? I understand you like to write and edit your work by hand? Egan: I write and edit fiction by hand, it's true; journalism, I write on a computer. I don't know if the handwriting is so much a ritual as a necessary part of my process; I tend to write my first drafts in a fairly blind state, without a clear plan, and the handwriting helps me to generate the most interesting material. My best hours are usually in the morning, and I like to write leaning back, rather than at a desk, so I often sit in a soft chair. Unfortunately, that means that I often nap while writing! CNN: Can you tell us what you're reading right now or what authors inspire you? Egan: I've just finished re-reading ""The Tombs of Atuan"" by Ursula Le Guin. My 10-year-old son loved it and wanted me to read it, and I had little memory of my first reading as a teenager. She's a fantastic writer; such a huge imaginative reach, coupled with a really lovely sense of language. We're going to read ""A Wizard of Earthsea"" together next. Before that I read Emma Donoghue's ""Room,"" which absolutely flattened me, it was so good. For ""Goon Squad,"" I was inspired by Proust's big novel, ""In Search of Lost Time."" I read it over years with a group of peers and feel a bit as if I'd lived inside it (I think we had five children among us in our years of reading it!) Other inspirations: Edith Wharton's ""The House of Mirth"" (one of my favorite books ever), Robert Stone, Virginia Woolf and the great 19th-century storytellers, especially Dickens, George Eliot and Zola. CNN: In addition to your career as a novelist, you're also a successful journalist. Do you have any plans to return to nonfiction writing? Egan: I hope to keep writing journalism as long as I write fiction; it's afforded me such amazing adventures and opportunities. It does take a lot of time, so it's hard to do both at once, but I try to do a big journalism piece every couple of years, and I'll hopefully continue with that. CNN: What's next for you? Egan: There was a novel I was actually trying to start when I got sidetracked by that wallet and ended up writing ""Goon Squad."" I hope I can still sink into that other book. It's new territory for me; historical fiction, set in New York during and after World War II. I'm especially interested in women who built and repaired ships in the Brooklyn Navy Yard near my house. There were thousands of women working there during the war, doing jobs like welding and riveting that would have been unthinkable for women before that. I've had the honor of working on an oral history project that involved interviewing women who worked at the Navy Yard, most of whom are in their 80s now. When the war ended, the men came home, and the women were all fired -- expected to return to traditionally feminine jobs or not work at all. It seems like such rich material; I hope I can come up with some fictional way to bring it to life! ""A Visit from the Goon Squad"" also won the 2011 National Book Critics Circle Award and is a finalist for the Pen Faulkner Award, the LA Times Book Prize and the UK's Orange Prize.

"(CNN) -- The body of an Idaho miner trapped when the roof of the mine he was working in collapsed nine days ago was recovered Sunday afternoon, the company that owns and operates the mine said. ""Words cannot express the deep sorrow we feel at the tragic loss of our friend, colleague and 30-year veteran of the mining industry. Our thoughts and prayers are with his family, loved ones and friends,"" Hecla Mining Company said in a statement announcing that the body of Larry Marek had been recovered. Earlier Sunday, the company had said it believed that Marek, a Hecla employee for more than 12 years, was dead. Rescue workers had been digging through rocky earth more than 6,000 feet underground in an attempt to reach Marek, 53, following the April 15 collapse at the silver and mineral mine outside Mullan, Idaho. Marek was one of two men working in that part of the Lucky Friday mine when a 10-foot by 20-foot section of mostly rock fell on him, said Hecla's President and CEO Phil Baker. This all occurred roughly 6,150 feet below the Earth's surface. While the other man -- who has not been identified -- got out unharmed, there was no contact from Marek. Baker said earlier the cause of the collapse had not been determined, promising an investigation ""after the rescue efforts are complete."" Numerous special bolts and chain-link fence are used to keep the ground above the affected mine in place. Marek was trapped in a part of the mine where ore is removed and far from either of two possible exits, neither of which was adversely affected by the collapse, according to Baker. Lucky Friday is a ""deep underground silver, lead and zinc mine,"" according to Hecla's website. It has been in operation since 1942. Hecla has 275 of its employees routinely working at the mine, in addition to about 100 contractors, according to a company statement. Its website describes the Coeur d'Alene-based company, founded in 1891, as the ""largest and lowest-cost silver producer"" in the United States.","Larry Marek, 53, was trapped when the roof of the mine collapsed .

"(CNN) -- International regulators need to rethink their procedures for handling nuclear accidents in the wake of the crisis in Japan, the head of the U.N. atomic watchdog agency said Monday. The current framework for responding to emergencies dates back to the aftermath of the Chernobyl accident in 1986 and ""reflects the realities of the 1980s, not of the 21st century,"" International Atomic Energy Agency chief Yukiya Amano said. ""The speed at which information now travels and the huge volume of information in public circulation are among the most significant changes since then,"" Amano said. ""Live television and the internet provide constant updates on a crisis situation -- not always accurately -- to a global audience. The responsibility of the IAEA is to provide authoritative and validated information as quickly as possible, but doing this under the current arrangements inevitably takes time and has limitations."" Amano said the first priority remains cooling down the damaged reactors at the earthquake- and tsunami-battered Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. But he said authorities should move to revise their playbooks for similar crises ""in a reasonable amount of time,"" and an April conference on nuclear safety would be a good opportunity to start. Amano, the IAEA director-general, briefed the agency's governing board in Vienna after a trip back to his native Japan. During that visit, he pressed Prime Minister Naoto Kan to provide more information on conditions at Fukushima Daiichi, where three of the six reactors may have suffered core damage since the March 11 earthquake that struck northern Japan. Japan's government and the Tokyo Electric Power Company, which owns the damaged plant, have been criticized for failing to share information about conditions there fully and promptly. In Washington, the head of the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission said information coming out of Japan ""is sometimes conflicting, and certainly isn't at the level that any engineer would like to have to do a thorough analysis."" ""I don't believe we have anywhere near a clear understanding of what the plant conditions are like within the reactor building -- what kinds of electrical cabling has been damaged, what kinds of pumps and valves remain operable is a significant unknown right now, "" NRC Chairman Gregory Jaczko, whose agency has sent specialists to Japan to assist with the effort, said Monday. Amano told reporters Monday that information coming from Tokyo now is ""more extensive,"" and that damaged instruments at the plant may have prevented Tokyo Electric or Japanese regulators from having all the facts. However, when asked whether the response to the accident was quick enough, he said it was ""difficult to say."" ""We had the information. But I personally think understanding the context was not that easy, and that was one of the reasons I went there,"" Amano said.","Current procedures were developed after Chernobyl, the IAEA's chief says .
Those plans reflect ""the realities of the 1980s, not the 21st century,"" he says .

"(CNN) -- Snow began falling over Colorado and Kansas on Tuesday as yet another round of winter weather began marching across the United States barely a week after a record-setting winter storm roared across the Midwest. A powerful weather system poised over the Rockies is forecast to dump several feet of snow in the Mountain West and up to 10 inches in some parts of Oklahoma, forecasters said. Much of Oklahoma is under a winter storm warning, but snow and sleet are predicted as far south as central Texas, with 2 to 4 inches expected to coat the Dallas-Fort Worth area, the National Weather Service said. Later in the week, the system is expected to bring rain and snow to many areas of the Deep South before delivering a wintry mix along portions of the East Coast by Thursday. Snow is expected to spread into Oklahoma and north Texas on Wednesday and into Wednesday night, said CNN meteorologist Dave Hennen. By Wednesday, it also will begin spreading into the Southeast. Cities like Memphis, Tennessee, and Little Rock, Arkansas, could see 4 to 8 inches of snow, while lesser amounts are expected in Nashville; Birmingham, Alabama; and Atlanta. Bitterly cold temperatures will lock the center of the country in the deep freeze as the system moves east. ""Maximum temperature departures are expected to run 30 to 40 degrees below average for the central U.S. (Tuesday) with the same departures sinking south into Oklahoma and north Texas on Wednesday,"" the Weather Service said. Rain is likely across most of the Southeast on Wednesday and Wednesday night. Scattered snow is expected in the Great Lakes region Wednesday. A historic storm left its mark on at least 30 states last week, dumping about 2 feet of snow on the Chicago area and prompting Oklahoma's governor to declare a state of emergency. Another winter system at the end of the week left central and southern Texas a mess. Ice caused 800 crashes across the Houston metropolitan area and many freeways were closed because they were too dangerous to navigate, CNN affiliate KPRC reported. Hundreds of flights were canceled as the winter weather threatened the plans of Super Bowl enthusiasts headed for the game last Sunday in Arlington, Texas.","Snow forecast from the Rockies into the mid-South by Wednesday .

"(CNN) -- A year after the onset of the worst oil spill in U.S. history, one of the most prominent Louisiana figures dealing with the disaster's aftermath remains frustrated. ""A year later, I can't look you in the eye and tell you who's in charge,"" Plaquemines Parish President Billy Nungesser said in an interview with CNN's ""In The Arena"" host Eliot Spitzer.

"(CNN) -- Prosecutors in Maryland are weighing whether to bring additional charges against the two suspects who appear to be attacking a transgender woman at a McDonald's in a videotape made by one of the restaurant's employees, officials said Monday. The video, which went viral last week, shows two women kicking, punching and dragging another woman across the floor of the Baltimore restaurant. A store employee and a patron attempt to intervene, with limited success. Someone off-camera can be heard laughing, another yells ""Stop!"" several times during the attack and at one point, a voice can be heard telling the suspects, ""Y'all need to go before the police come."" The video ends with the victim shaking uncontrollably on the floor. Authorities said the alleged attack took place on April 18 at a McDonald's in Rosedale, on the outskirts of Baltimore. Officers were dispatched to the restaurant for a fight and discovered a 22-year-old female who appeared to be having a seizure, according to the Baltimore County police department. Witnesses told officers that the victim, identified by authorities as Chrissy Lee Polis, had been attacked by two teenage suspects. One of the suspects was 14 and charged as a juvenile with second-degree assault, according to police. The other suspect was 18 and charged with one count of first-degree assault and two counts of second-degree assault, police said. The motive for the attack was not immediately clear, though one of the suspects is cited in a police report as saying the fight was ""over using the bathroom."" A Maryland rights group, which is planning a vigil in support of Polis Monday night, said the attack was likely motivated by Polis being a transgender woman. ""No person ever deserves to be a victim of violence regardless of their gender identity or presentation. We encourage the state's Attorney General to investigate this as a hate crime based on gender identity,"" said Equality Maryland Board President Chuck Butler. Baltimore County police spokesman Lt. Robert McCullough said the state attorney's office is reviewing the case to see whether it merits additional charges. If the suspects are charged with a hate crime, they could face an extra 10 years in prison, in addition to whatever sentences they might get for the assault, plus an extra $10,000 fine, he said. Baltimore County State's Attorney Scott Shellenberger said his office was aware of the case and will make a determination soon as to whether more charges will be filed -- against the suspects and perhaps against other people. He declined to comment on whether the case was being investigated as a possible hate crime. The victim's mother, Renee Carr, told a producer for HLN's ""Dr. Drew"" that her daughter is devastated by the ordeal. Polis did not immediately respond to requests seeking comment. ""She's humiliated. They thought it was hilarious. The reason they did this is because she's an outcast, she doesn't fit in,"" said Carr. ""All my daughter wanted to do was use the bathroom."" McDonald's released a statement condemning the attack. It said the employee responsible for the video is no longer with the company and that ""appropriate action regarding other employees will take place as warranted."" ""We want to reassure our customers that your neighborhood McDonald's is a safe, welcoming place for everyone. We share our customers' concern. We are doing everything possible to make sure the right thing is done,"" McDonald's said.

"(Mashable) -- As the mainstream tablet war rages, a similar device battle is heating up in the restaurant industry. Tablets that take orders, entertain guests and accept check payments are coming to a table near you. One company that is selling those tablets, E la Carte, announced on Tuesday that it has raised more than $1 million in funding from prominent investors like Y Combinator, Dave McClure and SV Angel. The company will soon be launching tablets in 20 restaurants on the West coast. It also has a partnership with a large restaurant chain in the pipeline that hasn't been announced yet -- but the fact that Applebee's executives participated in the funding round might provide a hint. Why the interest in providing every table with their own touch-screen tablet? For starters, people buy more food when they can do so instantly, without waiting for service. In the six restaurants that ran a pilot scheme, according to CEO Rajat Suri, customers at E la Carte tables spent 10% to 12% more than those at other tables. E la Carte tablets allow customers to browse a full menu and communicate their orders directly to the kitchen. They come loaded with social games and a calculator for check splits and tips. They also allow customers to email themselves a receipt or instantly sign up for a loyalty club. In high-end restaurants, the tablet can suggest an appropriate wine pairing for a meal. Eventually, E la Carte might offer restaurants the option to compile data about their customers' preferences as they use the device. Some restaurants have attempted similar functionality by loading their menus onto iPads or asking customers to download an app onto their own devices. The iPad's problem in this situation: its minimum $499 price tag. Restaurants that can afford menus that expensive aren't casual restaurants, like Applebee's, where a digital ordering system seems more appropriate. Asking users to download an app like Storific poses the problem that not everybody carries a smartphone. Even those who do might not want to pause and download an app as they sit down to lunch. A dedicated device, which E la Carte plans to install for a price that is ""significantly lower"" than the iPad, seems to be a more promising way for the tech world to break into the $6 billion U.S. restaurant industry. Other companies are already in this game. Tabletop Media makes a similar tabletop product that it began to deploy in 2008. The company has established customers with chains like Chili's Uno's Chicago Grill, and California Pizza Kitchen and will be in 250 stores by the end of the summer. Both E la Carte and Tabletop Media charge the restaurants a monthly fee to use a network of devices. ""It's propelling the restaurant industry into the Internet age,"" Suri says. © 2010 MASHABLE.com.

"Cairo (CNN) -- Ousted Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak was complicit in shootings of anti-regime protesters during a period of upheaval in the country, a member of an official fact-checking commission said Tuesday. ""Whether the president gave the official order or remained silent knowing the shooting of protesters would take place, he is responsible for the 846 protesters who died during the January 25 revolution, especially since the killing started from Day One,"" said Judge Omar Marawan, the commission's secretary-general. Marawan held a press conference after the release of the commission's report, which said 846 civilians and 26 policemen were killed during 18 days of protests that led to Mubarak's resignation on February 11. The report focused on the killing and injury of demonstrators during the unrest in an effort to disperse them; what it said was the intentional opening of prisons, leaving a security vacuum; and the government's manipulation of the media. It also issued recommendations as the country moves forward. The commission watched videos that confirmed several prisons were opened by security forces, according to the report. Members also concluded that police used extreme force against protesters and fired shots at people who were trying to film the unrest from balconies and windows. In addition, the report accused police of intentionally running over protesters with vehicles. The commission's role was to compile information about the events and hand over their findings to the general prosecutor. Prosecutors have questioned Omar Suleiman, Egypt's former vice president and intelligence chief, the general prosecutor's office confirmed Tuesday, about events that took place during his brief period as vice president.","846 protesters and 26 policemen died during Egypt's unrest, commission says .

"(CNN) -- World No. 1 Rafael Nadal continued his winning ways on clay as he reached the quarterfinals of the Barcelona Open with a 6-3 6-1 win over Colombia's Santiago Giraldo on Thursday. The Spaniard's serve was surprisingly broken early by his 54th-ranked opponent, but from 3-3 he dominated the match to set up a clash with French seventh seed Gael Monfils. The 24-year-old has now won 31 consecutive matches on his favored surface, with his last defeat inflicted by Robin Soderling at the 2009 French Open. He already holds the record on clay for his 81-match winning run from 2005-07. Nadal missed last year's event in the Catalan capital but won the title the previous five years, and now has a record there of 27-1. He has a tour-leading 26 match victories this season -- two ahead of Novak Djokovic and Roger Federer, who are not in the draw. Nadal begins Barcelona bid in style . ""I will be playing against one of best players in the world who has reached the semifinals at Roland Garros, so it will be a tough match,"" Nadal said of Friday's clash with Monfils. The 24-year-old Monfils, who reached the last four at the French Open in 2008, moved into the last eight with a 6-4 7-6 (9-7) victory over ninth-seeded compatriot Richard Gasquet. Monfils, ranked ninth, lost in the last 16 at Monte Carlo in his first match in two months following a wrist injury suffered in San Jose which meant he could not take the court for his semifinal in the U.S. event. Fourth seed David Ferrer, who lost to Nadal in the final in the principality on Sunday, reached the last eight with a 6-3 6-2 win over Romania's Victor Hanescu. The 29-year-old next faces a rematch with Jurgen Melzer, who he beat in the semis on Saturday. The Austrian sixth seed progressed after coming from behind to beat Ferrer's 11th-seeded compatriot Albert Montanes 6-7 (2-7) 6-3 6-2. The winner of Friday's Ferrer-Melzer clash will face a Spaniard in the semifinals, with veteran Juan Carlos Ferrero and Nicolas Almagro also going through. Former world No. 1 Ferrero, playing his first event since last September's U.S. Open following wrist and knee surgery, battled past Italy's Simone Vagnozzi 7-6 (7-3) 4-6 6-4. The 31-year-old won this tournament in 2001 and was runner-up four years later when Nadal embarked on his streak of titles. Eighth seed Almagro ended the hopes of former world No. 3 Nikolay Davydenko, beating the the 29-year-old Russian 7-6 (7-2) 6-3. Almagro, 25, won two lower-level events on clay in South America in February before losing a final in Mexico. Another Spaniard, Feliciano Lopez, continued his country's dominance by joining Nadal, Ferrer, Ferrero and Almagro in the last eight. The 29-year-old left-hander beat Japan's Kei Nishikori 6-4 7-6 (7-5) to set up a clash with Croatia's 56th-ranked Ivan Dodic, who knocked out young Canadian 15th seed 7-6 (7-0) 4-6 6-3. Meanwhile, women's No. 1 Caroline Wozniacki marched into the semifinals of the Porsche Tennis Grand Prix in Stuttgart after a 6-4 6-1 win over home hope Andrea Petkovic on Thursday. The German, ranked 19th, led 4-2 in the opening set but Wozniacki fought back to avenge last month's defeat at the Miami Masters. The 20-year-old Dane will next play Poland's Agnieszka Radwanska, who beat German wild-card entry Kristina Barrois 7-5 6-3.. Last year's runner-up Samantha Stosur also reached the last four as the fifth seed upset world No. 3 Vera Zvonareva, beating the Russian 2-6 6-3 7-6 (7-3) in two and a half hours. The Australian, losing finalist in last year's French Open, will next face Julia Gorges -- who beat fellow German Sabine Lisicki 6-4 6-4.","Top-ranked Rafael Nadal extends his unbeaten run on clay to 31 matches .

"(CNN) -- A female correctional officer at a Washington state prison was strangled and an inmate who told officers he had planned to escape is under investigation, authorities said Sunday. Jayme Biendl, 34, was discovered late Saturday night after workers at the Monroe Correctional Complex noticed her keys and radio were missing, according to a statement from the Washington State Department of Corrections. Staff at the prison immediately went to where she worked and found her unresponsive, it said. Emergency responders declared Biendl dead at the scene shortly before 11 p.m. PT, the department said. She had been strangled, according to Chad Lewis, a department spokesman. Also Saturday night, a prison inmate was reported missing during a routine count, the department said. He was later found in the chapel lobby and told officers he had planned to escape, but changed his mind. The inmate, who Lewis identified as Byron Scherf, has since been taken to a segregation unit. The entire complex was on lockdown Sunday as officers investigate the incident, the statement said. Police are interviewing Scherf as a suspect in the officer's death, Lewis said.

"Victoria, Texas (CNN) -- This small Texas town is half a world away from the nuclear disaster unfolding in Japan. Nevertheless, the calamity is having a ripple effect. This week, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission held a scheduled two-day public hearing on a nuclear power plant near Victoria. There, Texans for Sound Energy Policy got a chance to voice their opposition on the proposed plant that would be built by electric power giant Exelon Generation. Those who support the plant repeatedly stated, ""Nuclear power is a safe energy source"" at the two-day hearing. In addition, supporters argued that the $16 billion project would add over 750 permanent jobs and 2,500 temporary construction jobs. How close are you to a nuclear plant? The money spent on the plant would be nearly five times more than Victoria's yearly budget, said Don Pozzi, an administrative judge and lifetime resident of Victoria County. ""That's a lot of money,"" said Pozzi, 67. In addition to the jobs, he argues the project would help add to the town's coffers through sales taxes and real estate taxes from new housing. That, he says, will help the small town of about 87,000 people continue to grow. And that's exactly what rancher David Huber is afraid of -- a larger Victoria with a nuclear power plant. ""I've been opposed from the beginning and I'm still opposed,"" said Huber, 62. The proposed site for the reactor is located in a rural farming district approximately seven miles from Huber's ranch. Huber, a 6-foot-2 rancher with a thick Texas accent and an affable personality, said he loves his land and his way of life. His family has been a part of the Victoria farming community since the late 1800s. ""The road Exelon is planning on using for heavy hauling, my grandfather built around 1920,"" the rancher said, while driving around his ranch with his son, Jason Huber. Along the way, he proudly points the results of his family's hard work. ""Our roots are in the ground."" His concerns over the dangers of a possible nuclear reactor so close to his ranch have increased since the nuclear disaster triggered by last week's quake and tsunami in Japan, he said. Japan's nuclear crisis explained . Prior to choosing the location, Exelon Generation studied the possible impact of a nuclear power plant on Victoria's community, water and ecology. Exelon is the United States' largest nuclear power plant operator, running 17 plants in 10 states. See locations of U.S. nuclear power facilities . After studying the Victoria site, the power company found the risks to be low. But not everyone agrees. ""Nuclear power is a high risk, high stakes business,"" said Jim Blackburn with Texans for Sound Energy Policy at this week's NRC public hearing. ""Everyone here should be sobered by the events in Japan and by the seriousness of matters at hand,"" Blackburn added. ""Our thoughts and prayers go out to the people in Japan."" The NRC must grant final approval before any new nuclear plants can be built and operated. No new nuclear plant has won final approval in the United States since the Three Mile Island accident in 1979, although site work is being done at a couple of locations around the country. At this week's hearing, Exelon representative William Scott acknowledged the events in Japan, but he urged people not to overreact to what's going on in light of the continuous news coverage of the unfolding crisis. Texas town OK with nuclear plant expansion . He said he understands people's concerns and why politicians have taken a closer look at the safety plans for nuclear plants in their states. ""That's a perfectly natural reaction. We expect to be held accountable, that's part of our commitment to safety,"" said Scott. The situation in Japan doesn't seem to have any effect on those who steadfastly support the proposed nuclear plant near Victoria, Pozzi said. ""I don't expect people will change their minds,"" he said. ""I think people have had their minds made up."" He pointed to an unscientific online poll in the local newspaper, the Victoria Advocate, which found that despite the Japan incident, 53% of the 394 people polled said they favor the Victoria plant compared to 23% who oppose it. ""There are plane crashes, people continue to fly. There are car accidents, people continue to drive,"" Pozzi said. ""There's going to be nuclear power."" Victoria's Mayor Will Armstrong agreed. ""My support hasn't wavered at all,"" he said. Victoria county commissioner Gary Burns said he and other city officials have ""wined and dined"" Exelon in hopes of bringing billions of dollars to Victoria's economy. Burns said if the deal falls through, the town's economic future is at risk. Those who oppose the plant said the site where Exelon would build the plant lies on a ""growth fault"" which doesn't trigger earthquakes but can cause the Earth to shift. Blackburn and his Texans for Sound Energy Policy group fears the ground beneath the proposed nuclear site could sink, causing the cooling water ponds, vital to a nuclear plant, to drain away. ""It has active oil and gas extraction,"" Blackburn said about the proposed site. ""It can and will change over time."" Blackburn said Exelon has not addressed the growth fault issue in its filings with the NRC. But Steve Frantz, an attorney representing Exelon pointed out that the growth faults are ""are not tectonic in nature."" A study of the area shows one growth fault in the area moved only 8 inches over 40 years. ""They pose no seismic threat,"" said Frantz. ""The only threat is a possibility of surface deformation if the growth faults were to move."" He did say all safety structures including vital safety cooling ponds would be located away from the growth faults. ""We did find it and studied it,"" said Frantz. ""We planned the safety-related structures 500 feet away, which we felt was more than adequate."" Blackburn insists that even though growth faults are not seismic, they still pose ""potential dangers to the safe operation of a nuclear facility."" ""TSEP believes that good engineering can address many potential safety issues,"" he said. ""However, you cannot engineer around issues that are not recognized, studied and evaluated."" Some residents, like Huber, who would live near the proposed site, feel that it's a risk that is not worth taking. ""(What if) all of a sudden that (proposed) plant has a problem and there's an evacuation for a 10-mile radius?"" the rancher wondered. ""I'm in the 10-mile radius. What do I do? Try and pick up and try to run? This is my life."" ""Why would you even want to risk this natural beauty?"" he asked, as he stood on the banks of the San Antonio River next to his ranch at sunset.","Exelon wants to build a $16 billion nuclear plant near Victoria .

"Bangkok, Thailand (CNN) -- Renewed clashes in a disputed area along the Thai-Cambodian border killed at least one Thai soldier and left 11 people injured Saturday, Thailand's MCOT news agency reported. The skirmish came a day after officials said three Thai soldiers and three Cambodian soldiers were killed in fighting there. Each side blames the other for the violence, which erupted Friday near two temples in the Phanom Dong Rak district of Thailand's Surin province. Authorities have evacuated thousands of people from nearby villages. The Cambodian defense ministry on Saturday blasted what it called Thailand's ""repeated deliberate acts of aggression,"" including firing heavy artillery weapons and flying military planes deep into Cambodian airspace. In a letter to the U.N. Security Council on Friday, Cambodia's deputy prime minister said Thai troops had engaged in a ""large-scale attack with many types of weapons,"" targeting areas around temples ""deep inside Cambodian territory."" Hor Namhong wrote that Thai artillery pieces fell as far as 21 kilometers (13 miles) in its territory during what he called the fifth such attack since 2008 when the U.N. Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization placed Cambodia's Preah Vihear Temple on its World Heritage List. Thai Foreign Minister Kasit Piromya, meanwhile, said he'd send off a ""protest letter"" of his own, the state-run MCOT news agency reported Saturday. He disputed reports that Thai forces had used poisonous gas or flown over Cambodian territory, except for helicopters trying to airlift out wounded soldiers. ""We protected our sovereignty, and our counterattack targeted the Cambodian army base to limit the area of the clash,"" said Kasit, who added that Thailand still wanted to settle the issues diplomatically. Thai Deputy Prime Minister Suthep Thaugsuban told MCOT on Saturday that one recent clash began after Cambodian troops fired into Thai territory.Earlier, Thai army Lt. Col. Siriya Khuangsirikul accused Cambodia of violating an agreement not to bring weapons or post troops in the disputed area. Cambodian Lt. Gen. Chhum Socheat claimed Thai troops shelled and damaged temples, and flew over Cambodian territory with spy planes, Cambodia's state-run Agence Kampuchea Presse reported. At least 10 people were killed when renewed fighting flared up in another disputed border area between the two nations in February, prompting the U.N. Security Council to issue a statement calling on both sides to implement a permanent cease-fire and ""resolve the situation peacefully and through effective dialogue."" The office of Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said in a statement Saturday that the U.N. chief was ""troubled"" by the recent clashes, especially after ""initial signs of progress"" toward resolving their conflict peacefully. ""The Secretary-General calls on both sides to exercise maximum restraint and to take immediate measures to put in place for an effective and verifiable ceasefire,"" the statement said. Those clashes, which lasted four days, stemmed from a longstanding conflict related to the 11th-century Preah Vihear temple. Both Cambodia and Thailand lay claim to the temple, which sits atop a cliff on Cambodian soil but has its most accessible entrance on the Thai side. At the time, each nation accused the other of firing first, according to a statement from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. Conflict over the site has taken place periodically for years. In 1962, the International Court of Justice in The Hague, Netherlands, ruled that the site was in Cambodia, adding that the structure was ""an outstanding masterpiece of Khmer architecture."" But Thailand says the 1.8-square-mile (4.7-square-kilometer) area around Preah Vihear was never fully demarcated, and blames a map drawn at the beginning of the 20th century during the French occupation of Cambodia. Thaugsuban said Saturday that the border dispute must be resolved peacefully between the two parties, without the involvement of a third party. In his latest letter to the United Nations, his Cambodian counterpart Namhong accused Thailand of not being earnest in its bids to resolve the dispute peacefully, calling its neighbor's actions ""a pretext for using its larger and materially more sophisticated armed forces against Cambodia.""

"Madrid, Spain (CNN) -- Portuguese Prime Minister Jose Socrates resigned Wednesday in a televised speech to his debt-ridden nation after parliament rejected his government's austerity plan intended to ease the financial crisis. Opposition parties combined to vote down the plan, which they viewed as hurting Portugal's poor, that had been formulated without broad consensus. Socrates, a Socialist, had threatened to resign if the plan failed. He gave his resignation to the Portuguese president, Anibal Cavaco Silva. The presidential website indicated it was not clear there would be snap elections. Another option, the website indicated, would be for a replacement to be appointed without elections. Socrates said the country is the real loser in the decision. ""The obstruction from the opposition today was taken to intolerable levels."" Socrates said in his address. ""It wasn't just about obstructing the government, it was about obstructing the country."" The defeated plan was the latest in a series of austerity measures aimed at resolving Portugal's financial crisis. Where previous plans had increased the country's value added tax to 23 percent and cut salaries of government workers by an average of 5 percent, the latest proposal included budget cuts and a freeze on pensions. Critics said the plan would unfairly hurt low-income residents already struggling under higher taxes. Miguel Macedo, a member of parliament who voted against the proposal, said all of Socrates' plans have failed and the country needs change. He said the government's policies have increased poverty. But Silvia Pereira, a lawmaker who supported the plan, said in debate over the proposal that rejecting the plan could throw the country into turmoil. ""The responsibility belongs to whom wanted to add a political crisis to our existent economic crisis,"" Pereira said. The political turmoil comes on the eve of European Union summit in Brussels that had been expected to focus on the debt crisis in the eurozone but which will now likely include additional attention on Portugal. Portugal's high debt and borrowing costs have prompted repeated speculation in the European Union and in international financial markets that the nation might need a bailout, like Ireland and Greece before it. Socrates' Socialists hold 97 seats in the 230-seat parliament. A spokesman for the main opposition center-right Social Democrats, with 81 seats, said his party was rejecting the government's plan because ""we are trying to save the country, not the prime minister."" Smaller opposition parties on the left and right also voted against it. The question for many is how Portugal's delicate financial situation, with 10 percent unemployment and tepid economic growth, will fare under a caretaker government. A top Socialist Party official, Jose Lello, told CNN that Socrates will go to Brussels on Thursday for the European Union summit. Socrates' resignation will not have much ""impact on the Portuguese economy,"" financial analyst Filipe Garcia told CNN before the vote. ""It's more important what's discussed in Brussels than in Portugal,"" Garcia said from his office in the northern city of Porto . Portugal aims to cut its public sector deficit from 6.8% of gross domestic product last year to 4.6% this year and to just 3% next year, in line with European Union guidelines. But Lello said the opposition had distorted the plan's contents. He said the pension cuts it envisioned would have hit some of the wealthiest Portuguese, not the poorest. ""We offered to negotiate to all parties,"" Lello said. ""If we go to elections, let's see."" CNN's Joana Godinho contributed to this report.","NEW: Prime minister resigns after parliament rejects austerity plan .

"(CNN) -- Hundreds of angry Iraqis demonstrated in the holy Shiite city of Karbala on Thursday, protesting the use of foreign troops in the crackdown against anti-government protests in Bahrain. This week, military forces from the Gulf Cooperation Council -- including Saudi Arabia -- arrived in Bahrain to help the kingdom control a wave of anti-government protests, prompting the Obama administration and U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon to urge council members to act with restraint and to allow the citizens of Bahrain to demonstrate peacefully. Although Bahrain's protesters are making primarily economic and political demands, there is a sectarian dimension: Bahrain's population is 70% Shiite; the royal family is Sunni, as is the royal family of Saudi Arabia. Saudi Arabia recently has seen small demonstrations among its minority Shiites. In Karbala, some protesters carried Shiite flags as they condemned the brutal force wielded against Bahrain's predominantly Shiite demonstrators. The U.N. human rights chief and Amnesty International issued statements Thursday calling on the Bahraini government to halt the violence against its people. Some of the Iraqi demonstrators held up banners reading, ""No foreign troops in Bahrain."" Others shouted, ""Wahhabis! Leave Bahrain immediately,"" referring to Saudi Arabian troops. A similar protest was held in Baghdad Thursday, and, during the parliamentary session, Sunni and Shiite lawmakers also condemned the foreign troops being employed in the crackdown. Sunni Parliamentary Speaker Osama al-Nujaifisaid the violence against protesters could ""potentially tear apart the social fabric of the country and in the region."" Former Prime Minister Ibrahim al-Jaafari, a Shiite, used stronger language during a speech to lawmakers, calling the use of foreign troops in Bahrain a ""flagrant violation."" Sunnis make up the majority in the Arab world. Iraq has seen its own share of clashes over anti-government demonstrations this year. Since February, at least 20 Iraqis have been killed and hundreds have been wounded in protests across the country, part of a series of demonstrations that have swept across the Middle East and parts of Africa this year, toppling the leaders of Tunisia and Egypt. The protests in Iraq demanded economic progress, an end to corruption and basic services and freedoms. ""Many Iraqi protesters were killed and wounded when they only demanded some political reforms,"" Ali Raheem, an Iraqi activist, told CNN. ""God knows what will happen to them if they demonstrate to topple this sectarian government."" The United Nations expressed its concerns about violence used against protesters across the country. ""While acknowledging the duty incumbent on the Iraqi authorities to ensure law and order in the country, the U.N. in Iraq notes with concern that several instances of human rights violations in relation to the demonstrations have been reported,"" it said in a statement. ""The reported violations include disproportionate use of force by Iraqi security forces that resulted in the death and injury of a number of citizens; restrictions on the media and attacks on media organizations; and arrests and detention of, in particular, journalists."" The Iraqi government was formed in December, nine months after an inconclusive national election. This is the second elected government in the nearly eight years after a U.S.-led invasion toppled Saddam Hussein.","Saudi Arabia and other Arab nations are helping Bahrain quash protesters .

"(CNN) -- Getafe became the third Spanish football club to pass into foreign ownership on Thursday after signing a deal with Dubai's Royal Emirates Group. The Madrid-based team followed in the footsteps of Malaga and Racing Santander, which were also taken over by overseas interests in the past year. Royal Emirates Group, a conglomerate chaired by Sheikh Butti Bin Suhail Al Maktoum, has a portfolio of more than 200 companies including oil and gas, renewable energy, travel and tourism, health care, water purification, real estate & construction. The deal is worth between €70-90 million ($101-131 million) and will see the club's title rebranded to ""Getafe CF Team Dubai."" Getafe's previous owner and president Don Angel Torres Sanchez signed over to his successors in a ceremony at Dubai's Burj Al Arab hotel on Thursday, accompanied by club captain Manu del Moral. The group said it was heavily involved in sports in the United Arab Emirates and abroad. ""The investment in Getafe CF is an evolution of this vision and an expression of renewed confidence that Dubai's businesses are more confident today to make large investments abroad as well as at home,"" Royal Emirates partner managing director Dr. Kaiser Rafiq said. ""Caring for community needs through sport is at the heart of what the Royal Emirates Group aims to achieve. This will send the positive message to the world that Dubai cares."" Rafiq said that, being conscious of football's popularity with young Arabs, the group hoped to build a bridge between Europe and the Middle East ahead of the 2022 World Cup to be staged in Qatar. ""Royal Emirates Group plans to invest heavily in inducting new blood and promoting the team in the region,"" he said. Getafe, first formed in 1946 and refounded in 1983, has been in Spain's top flight since 2004-05. The club made a strong start to this season but hopes of qualifying for Europe have evaporated, with coach Michel's team 14th out of 20 with six matches remaining. Malaga became the first Spanish club to be bought by a foreign investor when Qatari billionaire Sheikh Abdullah Al Thani paid a reported €36 million ($52 million) in June 10. He splashed out on players and hired former Real Madrid coach Manuel Pellegrini, but the club is battling to avoid relegation. Santander sold out to Indian businessman Ahsan Ali Syed in January, with his Western Gulf Advisory company taking over. Since replacing coach Miguel Angel Portugal with the club's former boss Marcelino, the Cantabria-based team is four points above 17th-placed Malaga.","Royal Emirates Group completes takeover of Spanish club Getafe .

"(CNN) -- Nintendo 3DS, a glasses-free 3-D handheld video game system, arrives March 27 for $249.99. Nintendo hopes it will make the strongest case yet for 3-D special effects affordability and relevance. But calling it a gaming console may be the greatest hoax ever perpetrated on the American public. Gaming, it turns out, might be among the least of the system's capabilities. The device will also deliver an array of other fully-connected entertainment experiences, according to Nintendo of America President Reggie Fils-Aime at the 2011 Game Developers Conference. From 3-D movies to TV shows, digital music to augmented reality applications, the company is clearly assigning tremendous importance to non-gaming applications. Though they won't say it directly, Nintendo clearly plans to make the system a Trojan horse for the larger world of 3-D multimedia. This should scare the competition. It's an infinitely more practical, and reasonably priced, 3-D argument than a $1500+ HDTV that tethers you to your couch. If Nintendo can make this portable device as common and trusted for 3-D entertainment as smartphones are for e-mail or Web surfing, it may single-handedly deliver the breakthrough that carries this technology to mainstream prominence. Yes, the system will play 3-D versions of premium game franchises like ""Street Fighter"" and ""The Legend of Zelda,"" says Fils-Aime. Yes, in the wake of increasing pressure from tens of thousands of readily available free and 99-cent apps, it will redouble efforts to justify $39.99 average software prices by offering ""premium experiences you can't get anywhere else."" But with free AT&T WiFi hotspot availability, Netflix movie streaming and the ability to create, download and physically interact with 3-D content among its arsenal of tricks, the company may have yet to play its trump card. The system lacks 3G/4G high-speed connectivity, and Nintendo is known for ardently policing material licensed for sale or distribution -- virtually or otherwise -- for its consoles. But by letting users view, download and generate a variety of 3-D material, the system could prove to be the most cost-effective and practical on-demand 3-D content portal on the market. Should Nintendo decide to enable sharing of user-generated content or enable the three-camera device for high-speed cellular connectivity and casual videoconferencing, the scope of this potential power play becomes even larger. While a dedicated stand-alone gaming system such as the Nintendo 3DS can't rival smartphones or tablet PCs for sheer ubiquity, consider this: . If 3-D technology takes off the way manufacturers hope, Nintendo's new device may give them an instant entrée into entirely new areas of entertainment, a leg up in the race to legitimize 3-D content and a secret weapon in the war to reclaim the territory recently ceded to Apple and its growing gaming focus.","Nintendo 3DS may be the greatest hoax ever perpetrated, says Steinberg .
Steinberg: Nintendo won't say directly, but system is portal for loads of 3-D multimedia .

"(CNN) -- It all happened so fast. In January, less than a month after fruit vendor Mohammed Bouazizi lit himself on fire, nationwide protests in Tunisia forced out President Zine El-Abidine Ben Ali. One month later, Egypt experienced its own revolution, and unrest spread across the region to other countries such as Bahrain, Jordan, Syria and Yemen. But in the last couple of months, it seems, the rate of change has slowed. A stalemate has developed in Libya's civil war. Government leaders aren't budging in Bahrain or Syria, and Yemen's future is still up in the air. So what happens next? Is more change on the way, or have we already seen the peak of what some call the ""Arab Spring""? CNN.com reached out to five experts for opinion and analysis. More specifically, we posed the following question: How do you see the ""Arab Spring"" playing out as we move toward the summer months? Taylor: Expect regime change in Libya, Yemen Julie Taylor, a Middle East specialist who lived in Egypt for four years, is a political scientist at the RAND Corp. It is likely that we will see at least two more regime transitions in the next six months. One is Yemen, where the ruling party has agreed to have President (Ali Abdullah) Saleh step down. It is not clear whether Saleh is on board with the deal -- if the opposition rejects the portion of the agreement that would protect Saleh and his family from prosecution, the president's departure might be delayed. But it will still be imminent. Saleh enjoys little support both inside and outside of Yemen, and all parties are growing frustrated with his attempts to drag out the inevitable. Another is Libya, where most think any resolution that keeps (Moammar) Gadhafi in power and divides the country is untenable. Syria is harder to call. The protesters are unrelenting, but -- unlike in Yemen -- troop leaders in Syria's armed forces are highly committed to President (Bashar) al-Assad. Their fates are tied to the maintenance of the regime because they are from the same minority Alawite sect. Al-Assad also has the ability to initiate a mass crackdown, and the regime's primary patron, Iran, would likely support such a move. Overall, prospects for consolidated democracies look somewhat bleak. Prior to the revolutions, a network of civil society groups had developed in Egypt and Tunisia, cultivating a civic culture that promoted popular engagement and democracy. But the two countries still struggle to establish democratic systems. The countries in a possible ""second wave"" of Arab revolutions have even dimmer prospects. Other than tribes, Libya essentially has no civil society, and it has a long-isolated educated class. Yemen has civil society organizations but fewer well-educated individuals or solid state institutions. And Syria, despite its comparatively well-educated population, has virtually no civil society; removal of the regime would likely devolve into a civil conflict between Alawites and majority Sunnis. Sharqieh: 'We are seeing dictators inspiring dictators to resist' Ibrahim Sharqieh is deputy director of the Brookings Doha Center. One major lesson that Tunisia and Egypt shared with their fellow Arabs is that dictatorships do have an end and that they can be abolished sooner than many think. Furthermore, they inspired the entire region with their success, breaking the barrier of fear and replacing it with a pragmatic optimism that change can be achieved. However, the other half of the story that remains is the question of what it takes to effect democratic change in the region. In particular, it is becoming increasingly obvious that a smooth overthrow of entrenched dictators is quite an elusive goal. The Tunisian and Egyptian paradigm of regime change in three weeks probably cannot be repeated. In the coming months, a new paradigm for political transition will likely emerge in the Arab world. We should be prepared to see different means of quelling public unrest in the region. Possible new scenarios include civil wars, coups, disintegrations, sectarian tension, external intervention, internationalization and negotiated political settlements. The countries at risk -- particularly Libya, Yemen, Syria and Bahrain -- are unlikely to follow one particular path because each one of them has its own set of dynamics and domestic drivers for change. In Tunisia and Egypt, we have seen people inspiring others to revolt; however, in the new paradigm, we are seeing dictators inspiring dictators to resist. It is true the emergence of these new dynamics is likely to make the process of political change longer and more complicated. But regardless of how long this process takes, the Arab public has learned that the time has come for aging dictators to depart -- and that the only option at this point is to move forward with the long-overdue call for freedom and justice. Khanna: Arab world has the money to solve its problems Parag Khanna, author of ""How to Run the World: Charting a Course to the Next Renaissance,"" is a senior research fellow with the New America Foundation. As the ""Arab Spring"" moves into summer, things are likely to remain hot. While it is anyone's guess what will happen in Libya -- consolidation or partition are still equally viable scenarios -- tensions will surely rise in Egypt as government reforms falter and election preparations ramp up. And Bahrain might have quelled the protests in its streets, but it will have done little to address the core sectarian inequalities that are a key driver of its present instability. Importantly, the bottom-up push for accountability will continue as long as citizens, business groups and other reformers keep the pressure on for emergency laws to be repealed, parliaments to be strengthened and economic reforms to be undertaken. Particularly with respect to the economy, private creditors and outside agencies such as the International Monetary Fund can play a valuable role in forcing governments in Egypt and Syria to loosen their economic grip faster than entrenched elites would like. The role of the Gulf Cooperation Council, which includes countries such as Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, will remain pivotal and come ever more into the spotlight. These oil-rich states have been key investors across the Arab world and play a vital role in financing the necessary structural economic modernization the region needs. Remember that the Arab world is not the third world -- it has all the money it needs to solve its own problems. The question is if it can overcome the stale Arabism of the past, which affirmed insecure nationalism, in favor of a new Arabism that champions trans-Arab interdependence. Cherif: Odds stacked against Syrian revolution  Feryal Cherif is an assistant professor for the political science department at the University of California, Riverside. The events in Tunisia and Egypt offer hope that uprisings elsewhere in the Middle East and North Africa will meet with success. Perhaps most striking are the events unfolding in Syria, where few predicted mass protests against Bashar al-Assad's regime and where the conventional wisdom suggests that past repression, ethnic-religious diversity and relative popularity would shield al-Assad. In many ways, the events in Syria draw strong parallels to Egypt. In the hopes of appeasing protesters, al-Assad offers concessions every few days -- a lifting of the niqab ban, offering citizenship to Kurds and promising to rescind emergency law. But much like (Egyptian President Hosni) Mubarak, al-Assad constantly appears to be a step behind the protesters' demands. While the magnitude of Syrian protests is impressive, the fate of al-Assad's regime remains an open question. Specifically, a loyal military and the legacy of limited association rights significantly diminish the prospects of a successful revolution in the country. In Egypt, protesters benefited from relatively strong NGOs (nongovernmental organizations) and experience with activism, but Syria has a more limited and restricted civil society. Data from the NGO Regulation Network reveal that there are nearly five times more civil society organizations per capita in Egypt than Syria. Except for the Hama revolt in 1982 and Kurdish demonstrations in 2004, political protest in Syria has been minimal. All of this suggests that Syrian protesters have less local political experience and knowledge, fewer resources and smaller networks that they can tap into. These deficiencies limit protesters' ability to pressure the regime and ensure it is held accountable for its actions. Hashemi: Revolts leave a 'powerful legacy' Nader Hashemi teaches Middle East politics at the Josef Korbel School of International Studies at the University of Denver, and he is author of ""The People Reloaded: The Green Movement and the Struggle for Iran's Future."" The notion of an ""Arab Spring"" is a misnomer because it assumes that the Arab world is a monolith. Yes, these uprisings are motivated by common political and economic grievances rooted in decades of authoritarian rule. And, yes, the protesters aspire to common democratic objectives. But each country in the Arab world is different. Each has its own internal story and confronts different obstacles related to class and minority cleavages, the strength of the military and state institutions, and the unity and democratic orientation of the opposition forces. Moreover, the nature and character of the forms of authoritarian rule in the Arab world -- and the devastation they have wrought -- pose different challenges for democrats moving forward. There is cause for optimism even if we assume a worst-case scenario where democratic forces are crushed in Libya, Syria, Yemen and beyond. Were this to happen, these revolts would still leave behind a powerful legacy that future democratic forces can build upon, buttressed by the successful of examples of Tunisia and Egypt, where the prospects for democracy appear to be the greatest. Regardless of how many democratic transitions we witness this year, the tide of history has turned. The days are numbered for Arab authoritarian regimes, and those who argue that Islam/Arab culture is incompatible with democracy are left scrambling.","Experts weigh in on the Arab unrest and describe what they think will happen next .

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- A Tel Aviv district court Tuesday sentenced former Israeli President Moshe Katsav to seven years in prison on multiple charges of rape and sexual harassment. The case involved three women -- two in the president's office and one in the Tourism Ministry. In late December, the three-judge panel found Katsav guilty of two charges of rape, two charges of forceful sexual harassment and one charge of sexual harassment. Katsav had agreed in 2007 to plead guilty to lesser charges and pay a fine to avoid jail time, but he pulled out of the deal when it came time to enter his plea. The plea bargain caused a public storm in Israel, mainly because it did not include charges of rape, contrary to what had been suggested in a draft indictment. Katsav, of the center-right Likud Party, was president of Israel from 2000 to 2007. He was minister of tourism before that. The charges stem from allegations made against him in both jobs. He resigned the presidency in June 2007 because of the sexual assault allegations. The judges who read the verdict said that ""due to the severity of the crime, the punishment must be clear and precise."" They added that ""all are equal in the eyes of the law."" Katzav shouted at the judges, ""You let lies win."" The former president's sentence will start on May 8. His lawyers said he will appeal the sentence. Katzav left the court without saying a word, surrounded by family members and security who tried to shield him from the media. ""This is a day of sadness and shame, but also one of deep appreciation and pride in the Israeli justice system,"" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said. ""No one is above the law, not even a president."" CNN's Michal Zippori contributed to this report .","Moshe Katsav pulls out of an earlier plea deal .

"(CNN) -- Borussia Dortmund's title celebrations have been put on hold for another week after the champions-elect suffered a shock defeat on Saturday and closest rivals Bayer Leverkusen won. Dortmund would have clinched a first German crown since 2002 with victory against the Bundesliga's bottom team if Leverkusen had drawn or lost. But the second-placed club kept the title race going into the final three games of the season with a 2-1 victory over Hoffenheim, then Borussia Monchengladbach kept alive the club's slim survival hopes with a 1-0 victory in the late match. Defending champions Bayern could not return to third place, being held at Eintracht Frankfurt, and face a battle for the final Champions League spot with Hannover -- who beat Freiburg 3-1 on Thursday. The title race continues next weekend in a similar scenario as Dortmund host Nuremberg on Saturday and Leverkusen travel to Cologne on Sunday. Hannover win puts pressure on Bayern . Dortmund's lead was trimmed to five points after Mohamadou Idrissou's winner 10 minutes before halftime, which moved Gladbach off the bottom on goal difference above St. Pauli and left three clubs on 29 points. Wolfsburg can climb out of that triumvirate at home to 14th-placed Cologne on Sunday, but even victory will still leave the 2008-09 champions in the relegation playoff place. Cameroon striker Idrissou held off Neven Subotic, cut in from the left and beat Dortmund keeper Roman Weidenfeller to give the home team a shock lead. Dortmund coach Jurgen Klopp brought on Mohamed Zidan and top Lucas Barrios, but the closest the visitors came to scoring was when teenager Mario Gotze hit the crossbar. Leverkusen came from behind to beat mid-table Hoffenheim, who led in the 28th minute when Iceland midfielder Gylfi Sigursson went past three men before before beating goalkeeer Rene Adler. Sigursson also hit the post before the home team equalized five minutes from halftime, when Michal Kadlec headed in Arturo Vidal's corner. Jupp Heynckes' side then went ahead six minutes after the break as Vidal slammed home the winner when Hoffenheim's defense could not clear the ball from their own box. Bayern needed a controversial late penalty to salvage a point at struggling Eintracht Frankfurt, who took the lead nine minutes after halftime. The home side, hovering uncomfortably above the relegation playoff place, cheered the sellout crowd when Sebastian Rode drove in a 54th-minute shot after Bayern midfielder Anatoliy Tymoshchuk deflected Benjamin Kohler's free-kick into his path. Theofanis Gekas should have doubled the lead but squandered two chances before Bayern received a lifeline with two minutes left when Martin Fenin was ruled to have fouled Luiz Gustavo. Mario Gomez netted the resulting penalty for his 23rd league goal this season, while angry home coach Christophe Daum was sent to the stands for arguing. Schalke's erratic season continued as the Champions League semifinalists lost 1-0 at home to Kaiserslautern ahead of Tuesday's visit by English leaders Manchester United. The winner came four minutes before halftime as Adam Hlousek played in Srdjan Lakic and the Croatian striker beat goalkeeper Manuel Neuer, who announced this week that he is poised to leave Schalke after deciding not to extend his contract. Kaiserslautern's first win at Schalke in more than a decade lifted the promoted club to eight points above third-bottom Wolfsburg. St. Pauli, however, look set for an immediate return to the second division after the 3-1 home defeat by Werder Bremen left the club bottom. Fin Bartels put St. Pauli ahead in the first half, but Markus Thorandt put through his own net five minutes after the break. Then Peruvian striker Claudio Pizarro scored twice in 60 seconds with less than 20 minutes to play to lift Bremen up to 10th, a point above Kaiserslautern. Stuttgart also eased any relegation fears with a 3-0 win at home to seventh-placed Hamburg, moving seven points clear of Wolfsburg. Germany striker Cacau opened the scoring in the sixth minute and rounded off the day after substitute Christian Gentner doubled the lead with 12 to play. In Sunday's other game, fifth-placed Mainz travel to fellow Europa League hopefuls Nuremberg.","Long-time leaders Borussia Dortmund must wait another week to clinch seventh title .

"(CNN Student News) -- February 23, 2011 . Download PDF maps related to today's show: . • New Zealand • Libya • Bahrain . Transcript . THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED. CARL AZUZ, CNN STUDENT NEWS ANCHOR: It is Wednesday, February 23rd, and we have a lot of international stories to tell you about today on CNN Student News. My name is Carl Azuz. We're starting off in New Zealand. First Up: Earthquake in New Zealand . AZUZ: The earthquake that jolted the South Pacific country yesterday left one of its biggest cities in ruins. Christchurch, located on New Zealand's east coast, was badly shaken during lunch hour. It was a 6.3-magnitude quake, followed by strong aftershocks, and it was heartbreaking, according to New Zealand's prime minister. Dozens are dead. Parts of the city, as we said, are in ruins. Rescuers are streaming in from all over the country and all over the region, rescue being the nation's top priority at this point. 80 percent of Christchurch is without power and phone lines are down, making communication challenging for many survivors. This quake was actually an aftershock itself, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. New Zealand's been rattled by a series of earthquakes since last September. This one was the worst, causing what could be New Zealand's darkest day, according to its leader. Yacht Hijacking . AZUZ: What started off as an around-the-world boating trip ended in tragedy on Tuesday. Four Americans were shot and killed by pirates who hijacked their ship in the Indian Ocean last week. The U.S. military says 19 pirates were involved in the hijacking. Four of them were killed. The other 15, captured. In these photos, you can see the ship, a 58-foot yacht called the Quest, along with its owners, Jean and Scott Adams. The couple, with two friends, changed course during their boating rally. They ended up in a part of the Indian Ocean where a lot of pirate attacks happen. Zain Verjee talked with a security expert to get an idea of how these pirates work. Here's part of that conversation. (BEGIN VIDEO) ZAIN VERJEE, CNN INTERNATIONAL ANCHOR: Just walk someone through how pirates hijack ships and, geographically, what do they do and then where do they end up? TIM HART, MARITIME UNDERWATER SECURITY CONSULTANTS: OK, well, pirates are predominantly based in the area called Puntland, which is this area here. It's in the the northeast area of Somalia. And realistically, what they'll do is they'll base themselves out of the pirate towns using mother ships, but disperse themselves. But they'll move further out into the Indian Ocean using these mother ships until they can find suitable targets. And some groups will obviously go further north, as we can see. And some will go further down south and stick to the coast of Tanzania or deep into the Indian Ocean. What they'll do is they'll move further out, they'll identify the targets and use these small attack skiffs to try and get on board. Once they've got on board and they've seized control of the vessel and the crew, they'll take the ships back to the anchorages off the coast of Somalia, and they'll sit there and negotiate with the shipping companies to pay a multi-million dollar ransom. (END VIDEO) I.D. ME . JOHN LISK, CNN STUDENT NEWS: See if you can I.D. Me! I'm a country that borders the Mediterranean Sea. I'm home to part of the Sahara Desert. You'll find me in northern Africa, between Tunisia and Egypt. We're talking about Libya, a country the CIA characterizes as ""an authoritarian state."" Libya Unrest . AZUZ: Protesters in Libya have been speaking out against that authoritarian government for more than a week now, and the government has reportedly responded with force. A human rights group says at least 200 people have been killed in violence there. The target of the protests is Libya's leader, Moammar Gadhafi. He's been in power more for more than forty years, as we told you yesterday. Protesters are calling on Gadhafi to step down. But during a speech yesterday, he refused. Colonel Gadhafi actually urged Libyans to go out and demonstrate for him. Ben Wedeman filed this report from one of the areas in Libya where Gadhafi's government is no longer in control. (BEGIN VIDEO) BEN WEDEMAN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: We were able to go to the city of Tobruk in eastern Libya, where we saw that, despite what Colonel Gadhafi is saying, he is not in control of the eastern part of the country. There's no army, no police on the streets. The anti-Gadhafi protesters have been able to burn down the police station, burn down party headquarters, burn down the intelligence headquarters. They are in open revolt. Some of the protesters telling us they not only want to overthrow the regime of Moammar Gadhafi, they want to see him killed or put on trial in the international court of The Hague. We also heard from some people that they have a plan to cut the export of oil from eastern Libya. Eastern Libya is where much of Libya's oil comes from. And this, they say, they will do unless the massacres, as they describe them, committed by the Gadhafi regime are put to an end. Otherwise, the situation in the heart of the country seems fairly calm. Gas stations are open and some stores are open. Although clearly, people are not going about their normal lives. One of the big concerns here is that the Libyan Air Force, which has been used against protesters in Tripoli, could be used again in this area to punish the people of eastern Libya for trying to overthrow the regime of Moammar Gadhafi. I'm Ben Wedeman, CNN, reporting from eastern Libya. (END VIDEO) Rallies in Bahrain . AZUZ: ""No Shia, no Sunni, only Bahraini."" That was the chant from this massive crowd marching through the streets of Bahrain's capital on Tuesday. Shia and Sunni are two of the main sects of Islam. In the Middle Eastern nation of Bahrain, the majority of the population is Shia, while the rulers are Sunni. Protesters there have been calling for change in their country's government. And some are saying that those Sunni rulers need to go. The king of Bahrain has met with some of the leaders of the groups that are against him and his government. And he's been taking steps to reform the country. Shoutout . TOMEKA JONES, CNN STUDENT NEWS: Today's Shoutout goes out to Mrs. Sowa's social studies class at Memorial Middle School in Albany, Oregon! Which of these animals is a reptile? You know what to do! Is it: A) Sea turtle, B) Frog, C) Salamander or D) Electric eel? You've got three seconds -- GO! A sea turtle was the only reptile we listed. That's your answer and that's your Shoutout! Creative for a Cause . AZUZ: Most sea turtles, including the loggerhead species, are endangered. But a group of 8th grade art students got the chance to meet one in person recently. This was part of a class project that started with a field trip and ended with a fundraiser that might help save some of these renowned reptiles. Take a look at this. (BEGIN VIDEO) SARAH MURRAY, GEORGIA AQUARIUM BIOLOGIST: They're an intricate part of the chain out there, the wildlife out there. We would just hate to lose this species completely. They're part of the balance, for sure. Without them, then a piece would be missing. Good morning, guys! Welcome to the Georgia Aquarium! Loggerhead sea turtles are endangered. Unfortunately, a lot of their habitats are getting destroyed along the beaches where they like to make nests. KENNETH DAVIS, 8TH GRADER: It was the first time I ever saw a sea turtle in person. When we came there, he was so excited to see us. QUAHMAYLA BROOKS, 8TH GRADER: Sea turtles are actually not only important, but they are really magnificent to look at the way they are in the water. KATY KING, DAVIS MIDDLE SCHOOL ART TEACHER: And what are some of the reasons why they are becoming endangered or why they are endangered? Ansley, name one. ANSLEY, 8TH GRADE STUDENT: Because we keep on destroying their habitat. SAMANTHA GODWIN, 8TH GRADER: We're gathering sketches of Murphy over here, and we're going to make these little clay models that we are going to sell so that we can raise money to actually adopt some sea turtles. DAVIS: I really think it's going to help make a difference because, not only for us, maybe other schools will say, ""this pretty much is a good idea, we probably should do the same."" You don't have to be a certain age to help out sea turtles that are endangered. KHAYREE ACKLIN, 8TH GRADER: I really didn't think I would be actually doing a project of something that is important to the world. MURRAY: I think it's awesome. I mean, having 8th graders take such a stance and an initiative to write letters to Congress and to care about these animals, I think it's absolutely great. We need all the help we can get. KING: I can teach the kids that we are a voice for change, that we can make people aware. And I think that's the purpose of an educator, is to make kids know that. MURRAY: They should want them for their children, as well. They should want them around for future generations, to come for their great-great-grandchildren. (END VIDEO) Before We Go . AZUZ: Before we go, it might seem a little early to be talking about a presidential race. But don't tell that to these guys. They're not running for the White House. They're campaigning to be one of the racing presidents for Major League Baseball's Washington Nationals. Washington, Jefferson, Lincoln: These monumental mascots are certainly at the head of the class when it comes to presidential pedigree. And after spending a season rounding the bases... Goodbye .

"Dallas (CNN) -- Texas firefighters Wednesday battled blazes that have scorched more than a million acres and have been burning for more than a week, according to the Texas Forest Service. ""We're actually seeing Texas burn from border to border. We've got it in west Texas, in east Texas, in north Texas, in south Texas -- it's all over the state,"" Forest Service spokeswoman April Saginor told CNN Radio. ""We've got one in the Dallas area that's four fires that have actually merged together."" Saginor said firefighters from 34 states are now in Texas battling blazes that, over the past two weeks, have destroyed more than 170 homes. ""Some (fires) are over 100,000 acres and they've been burning for over a week, so that's our priority right now,"" Saginor said, ""to put out the big ones."" Firefighter Greg Simmons died Friday trying to extinguish the East Sidwynicks fire in Eastland County. Five other volunteer firefighters have been injured by the East Sidwynicks fire, which has burned 3,000 acres. High-res photos: Wildfires blaze across Texas . Another firefighter was treated and released from a hospital in Graham after his bulldozer clipped a gas line and caused an explosion. ""The state of Texas is under siege,"" Saginor said. ""Wildfire is dangerous and it's threatening homes, lives and property on a daily basis. We caution residents to take this threat seriously and heed the call of their local authorities when told to evacuate."" The tinder-dry landscape has provided no shortage of fuel: On Wednesday, emergency personnel responded to four new fires across more than 1,000 acres, according to the Texas Forest Service. On Tuesday, they responded to 10 new fires, totaling more than 2,000 acres. Since January 1, the Texas Forest Service said, it has responded to more than 800 fires that have damaged some 5,000 structures across 1.4 million acres. Fire-friendly conditions were expected to return Thursday in various parts of the state, the National Weather Service said. ""Even if we get two inches of rain, the ground's going to eat it up,"" said David Hennig, a Weather Service meteorologist in Midland, Texas. ""We need a pattern shift."" West Texas averages nearly 15 inches of rain a year, according to Hennig. In the past six months, only 13-hundredths of an inch of rain have been recorded in that part of the state. While October through March is typically the dry season, that amount of rainfall is far below what it should be, Hennig said. He said weather models show the possibility of more storms this weekend and perhaps next week. While the rain is needed, storms accompanied by lightning pose a fire risk, he said. The Guadalupe Mountains face an extreme risk of fire through Thursday, according to the National Weather Service. Van Horn, which is 165 miles west of Odessa, is expected to face a critical fire threat on Thursday, as well as the nearby state Highway 54 corridor and the southeast New Mexico plains. One of the largest fires plaguing Texas rampaged between the towns of Graham and Graford. That fire, fewer than 70 miles west of Dallas-Fort Worth, burned into residential areas surrounding Possum Kingdom Lake Monday night, destroying and damaging homes in four or five neighborhoods, according to Marq Webb, a spokesman with the Texas Forest Service. Possum Kingdom resident Jackie Fewell set up a blog to provide updates on the crisis since fire warnings first were extended to the 3,000-home lake community. Crews protect Texas observatory with fire of their own . ""I was frustrated by a lot of misinformation that was being passed around by a lot of well-intentioned people through Facebook and text-messaging,"" she said. Fewell set up the blog Saturday as a part of the website for Pondera Properties, the lake's managing real-estate company, where she works. ""We have been able to generate this incredible response,"" Fewell said, noting the site has served as a bridge between residents in need of help and those able to provide it. ""We get remarks from people all over needing help,"" she said. ""If we put out a query to get 200 leather gloves to the area, we'll have those gloves within a few days."" Wildfire ravages home but spares family roosters . Fewell said the site has been responsible for aiding residents in a number of ways, from saving abandoned pets to providing real-time updates on properties threatened by the blaze. The Palo Pinto County Sheriff's office said it evacuated 200 residents from the town of Palo Pinto and moved them to shelters. Two buses were sent to evacuate jail inmates, said Deputy Randy Hunter. That evacuation order was lifted Wednesday afternoon. Dianne Simpson told CNN affiliate KSAN that she and her husband watched nervously as a wildfire approached their house near the Tom Green County-Coke County line, where residents had evacuated. Texas Forest Service: Fire dangers and advisories . ""We just sat out here on the deck and watched it burn, and it was just pretty devastating,"" Simpson said. ""You're just sitting here going 'There's nothing I can do.' "" According to KSAN, the blaze stopped just 330 yards from the Simpsons' house. By Wednesday, the evacuation order for Coke County had been lifted, according to Texas Forest Service spokeswoman Saginor. CNNRadio's Thomas Andres and CNN's Dave Alsup contributed to this report.","NEW: Forest Service responded to 4 new fires Wednesday totaling more than 1,000 acres .

"(CNN) -- Moammar Gadhafi's first grab at power occurred 42 years ago in the eastern Libyan city of Benghazi, when he led a crew of fellow military officers in taking over key government institutions on his way to usurping the nation's monarchy. Ever since, he's referred to himself as the Leader of the Revolution -- though politically, at least, Libya has appeared to be largely stable, with few threats to Gadhafi's power. But that all changed this past week, with reports that tens of thousands took to the streets calling for an end to Gadhafi's rule. And, once again, that change began in Benghazi. CNN has been unable to independently confirm information on the escalating unrest in Libya, the most isolated nation in the region. The government has not responded to repeated requests from CNN for access to the country and maintains tight control over communications. Still, phone interviews with witnesses and others on the ground suggest that some of Gadhafi's strongest opposition has been in Benghazi, where protests began and have escalated. Since then, there have been indications that the opposition movement has spread westward toward the capital Tripoli. Why Gadhafi suddenly came under fire after decades of a strong-handed, seemingly stable rule remains a question. One obvious factor is that Libya borders Tunisia, where popular unrest last month helped unseat authoritarian President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali after more than two decades in power. Weeks later, a similar movement contributed to the end of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak's 30-year rule. Gadhafi is far from alone now. Anti-government protests have popped up all around the Arab world, with pressure growing on powerful leaders in places like Bahrain, Yemen and Algeria. But what makes Libya unique, in large part, is its colorful, controversial and powerful leader. Gadhafi was a captain in Libya's army when, on September 1, 1969 -- which is referred to as Revolution Day in Libya -- he and others launched the coup by assuming control of key institutions in Benghazi. The overthrow was completed in two hours, according to GlobalSecurity.org, an independent provider of security information. At the time, the United States had military aircraft at Wheelus Air Base in Libya. And Washington did not initially oppose the coup, a 2008 Congressional Research Service report noted. Gadhafi soon established himself as one of America's most vocal, and flamboyant, enemies. By 1972, Gadhafi urged Muslims to fight the United States and Great Britain and vowed support for black revolutionaries in America. The next year, he launched a program ""to destroy imported ideologies, whether they are Eastern or Western,"" a U.S. State Department timeline noted. In 1979, the U.S. designated Libya as a state sponsor of terrorism. The relationship only worsened in the 1980s, when U.S. military aircraft shot down two Libyan fighter jets. Libya's alleged attacks in Sudan, support for Nicaragua's Sandanista government and role in the bombing of a West Berlin nightclub only further stoked the ire of the administration of U.S. President Ronald Reagan, who called Gadhafi a ""mad dog."" Libya's standing took a turn with the 1988 bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, killing 270 people. World pressure intensified on Tripoli after Libyan intelligence agents were implicated. By 1993, Gadhafi told the International Herald Tribune that he was taking a more conciliatory approach to world affairs. He called U.S. President Bill Clinton ""the savior of the new world,"" and decried Islamic militants as ""mad dogs"" and ""terrorists."" Clinton continued to keep pressure on Libya, signing a law imposing sanctions on companies that invested more than $40 million in that nation's petroleum industry. By 1999, Libya finally agreed to transfer the Pan Am 103 suspects for a trial in the Netherlands, leading to their conviction two years later. While still known for sometimes unconventional comments, Gadhafi appeared to evolve into more of a statesman -- at least internationally. In 2009, he was elected by member states as head of the African Union. That year, he also addressed the United Nations' General Assembly for the first time. Still, he proved to be more a firebrand than an even-keeled diplomat, delivering a blistering, wide-ranging 96-minute rant. His topics ranged from the U.N. Security Council to the assassination of U.S. President John F. Kennedy to a one-state solution for Israelis and Palestinians: Isratine. Gadhafi blamed the U.N. for failing to prevent 65 wars since its founding in 1945. But he also had kind words for U.S. President Barack Obama: ""We are content and happy if Obama can stay forever as the president of America,"" Gadhafi said. While Gadhafi seemed to take on a new role internationally, the world had few insights into what was happening inside Libya itself. Even as the U.N., the United States and other nations gradually began to soften their stance on Libya, reports suggested that freedom and basic rights remained widely restricted under Gadhafi. ""He hasn't changed,"" said Fouad Ajami, a professor at Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies. ""This is a monster. And the Libyan people are suffering from this."" The government maintained a tight control over its communications, clamping down on news accounts critical of Gadhafi and his colleagues. It also restricted outside media access, including denying repeated requests from CNN to enter the country this month. On Friday night, Libyan authorities shut down the nation's access to the internet, the U.S.-based tech firm Arbor Networks reported. While there have been indications of spotty Web coverage since, Libya sent out a text message warning about the ""inappropriate use of telecommunications services."" Internal political dissent was largely and often violently squashed. Moftah, an anti-government protester who did not give his full name for security reasons, said Gadhafi ""always plays on fear"" -- relying on a broad network of intelligence agents, secret police and others. ""He makes you afraid of your family, of your friends,"" Moftah told CNN. ""He will tell you that his secret police are everywhere."" And yet, despite the odds, people have still risen up this month against Gadhafi. For years, Libya profited greatly from its vast oil reserves. One of Gadhafi's first orders of business after taking over was to assume control of properties and other interests of international petroleum companies. Still, even the great wealth of oil couldn't change the fact that Libya has suffered in the recent global economic downturn. As in much of the Arab world, youth unemployment is high in Libya -- and most of the population has never known a leader other than Gadhafi. And the fact it began in Benghazi, despite the Libyan leader's early history, is not a surprise, said Dirk Vandewalle, an associate professor at Dartmouth and author of ""A History of Modern Libya."" He noted that the coastal city has traditionally been seen as somewhat disloyal to Gadhafi's regime. Whether the Libyan demonstrators can follow the leads of their Arab colleagues in Tunisia and Egypt remains to be seen. If they do, they will have to overcome a cult of personality -- much like prevailed in those countries -- without having any fallback as far as political institutions or legislation to build off should they succeed. Unlike Egypt, Libya has no constitution, established institutions or any kind of mechanisms in place to support a new nation. The nation and its leader are one. ""In Libya,"" Vandewalle said, ""there is nothing beyond Gadhafi and his close circle.""","Moammar Gadhafi led a military coup in 1969 that began in Benghazi .

"(CNN) -- AC Milan edged closer to a first Italian league title since 2004 after Saturday's 1-0 win at lowly Brescia, whose fellow strugglers Bari dropped into Serie B. Massimiliano Allegri's Milan, seeking to end years of dominance by Inter and claim an 18th scudetto, moved eight points clear of their city rivals with just four games to play thanks to a late goal from Brazil forward Robinho. Robinho netted on the counter-attack with eight minutes left after being set up by fellow frontman Antonio Cassano, leaving Brescia second from bottom and likely to follow Bari -- whose fate was sealed by a 1-0 defeat at home to Sampdoria. Brescia had hit the crossbar through Alessandro Diamanti's free-kick just before that goal, but an 18th defeat in 34 games left the club five points from safety and facing an immediate return to the second division. Cassano, starting with Zlatan Ibrahimovic suspended, had wasted three opportunities to put Milan ahead. Inter Milan moved up to second place with a 2-1 win over fourth-placed Lazio, bouncing back from last weekend's defeat at Parma which effectively ended the Nerazzurri's five-year title reign. Last season's success under Jose Mourinho was the club's 18th overall. Inter coach Leonardo saw Brazil goalkeeper Julio Cesar sent off for bringing down Mauro Zarate in the 22nd minute, and the Argentine striker put the visiting Rome side ahead from the resulting penalty. However, Dutch playmaker Wesley Sneijder curled in a trademark free-kick five minutes before halftime and top scorer Samuel Eto'o put Inter ahead eight minutes after the break after a mistake by defender Giuseppe Biava. Lazio also lost a player in the 66th minute when captain Stefano Mauri was sent off for a foul on Inter's Japan fullback Yuto Nagatomo. Napoli crashed 2-1 at eighth-placed Palermo despite taking the lead in the second minute with a penalty by striker Edinson Cavani. The Uruguayan missed a late spot-kick in last weekend's home defeat by Udinese, but was on target this time for his 26th league goal this season to be Serie A's leading scorer alongside Antonio Di Natale. Palermo, boosted by the 2-2 draw with Milan in the midweek first leg of their Coppa Italia semifinal, leveled in the 38th minute as Mattia Cassani made up for his early handball. Cesare Bovo then fired the winner with a penalty right on halftime after Giulio Migliaccio went down under the challenge of Christian Maggio. Udinese could have moved into fourth above Lazio, but lost 2-0 at home to Parma in a blow to the club's European hopes. On-loan Brazilian striker Amauri scored in the 13th and final minutes to lift his side three points above the relegation zone. Roma retained sixth place with a 1-0 win over Chievo as midfielder Simone Perrotta scored the only goal in the fourth minute. Seventh-placed Juventus were held 2-2 by Catania in the day's late match after blowing a two-goal lead. Veteran striker Alessandro del Piero netted twice in the first half, the opener from the penalty spot, but the Sicilians leveled with goals in the last 10 minutes by Argentine Alejandro Gomez and fellow midfielder Francesco Lodi. The result lifted Catania two points clear of the relegation zone. Sampdoria moved out of the bottom three on goal difference above Lecce thanks to a 59th-minute winner from striker Nicola Pozzi at Bari. Lecce lost 4-2 at Genoa despite a first-half double from striker David Di Michele, as on-loan striker Antonio Floro Flores and Argentina international Rodrigo Palacio both scored twice for the 10th-placed home side. Fiorentina moved up to ninth with a 2-1 win at Cagliari thanks to two goals from midfielder Alessio Cerci, while Cesena moved two points clear of the bottom three with a 2-0 win at Bologna.","Robinho's late winner puts AC Milan eight points clear with four games to play .

"(CNN) -- It was two years late and billions of dollars over budget, but this week the Singapore Airline-owned A380 completed its maiden passenger journey between Singapore and Sydney. Making history: the first double bed on a commercial jet . On board were nearly 500 passengers who had bid thousands of dollars for the historical experience. This was a turning point in aviation history as Airbus' superjumbo became the world's largest aircraft. And the time had finally come for it to receive some admiration. Singapore Airlines' CEO, Chew Choon Seng named the jetliner the ""queen of the skies"". Tom Enders, CEO of Airbus said he would like to celebrate his 25th wedding anniversary on one of its double beds. And CNN's Richard Quest, who was on board the maiden flight, said there was ""nothing quite like it"". The luxury on board, he said, sets a new standard for air travel. It's the quietest large passenger jet ever built (inside and out), it has a low fuel-burn to reduce fuel use and emissions, it can carry 40 percent more passengers than other large aircraft and in greater comfort. But the feature that has attracted greatest interest on the Singapore Airlines A380 is its ''beyond first class"" cabins. Behind the sliding doors of the Singapore Airlines Suites, the well-heeled can luxuriate in a private cabin designed by leading French yacht designer, Jean-Jacques Coste. There's a wide leather seat and alongside that, a standalone bed. This is two meters long with Givenchy duvets and cushions. And for couples traveling, the beds on the middle two suites can be converted into double beds. From bed or chair, travelers can catch a movie on a 23-inch widescreen LCD. Laptops can be plugged into an in-seat power supply and business travelers with just a thumb drive can plug this into a USB ports and access a suite of office tools on Singapore Airlines' in-flight entertainment system. Celebrity chefs including Britain's Gordon Ramsay and Georges Blanc were behind the first class menu that can be eaten off Givenchy tableware. Unlike other airlines, that have considered offering casinos, gyms and showers on their future A380s, Singapore Airlines has opted instead for a configuration that, whilst offering luxury, also makes money. As Chew Choon Seng, CEO of Singapore Airlines reminded reporters last week, the first Boeing 747s soon ditched the lounges and bars on the upper decks in favor of seats that could generate cash. Behind the 12 luxury suites there are 399 economy seats, ranked 10-abreast on the upper and lower decks, as well as 60 business class seats that are the biggest yet at 87 centimeters wide. Singapore Airlines has ordered 19 superjumbos for an estimated price tag of $5.7 billion. The second is due to arrive next February with further deliveries later in 2008. Tickets for the A380's first return commercial flight between Singapore and Sydney were sold at auction on eBay. One passenger paid $100,000 for the experience, with the majority paying between $1,500 and $5,000. The $1.4 million raised has gone to charities in Singapore, Sydney and a global humanitarian organization. From Sunday 28 October, Singapore Airlines will commence its scheduled service between Singapore and Sydney on one of the three daily flights in each direction. The jetliner to be delivered next spring will be used on one of the three daily flights between Singapore and London's Heathrow Airport. It's been a long road to this point for Airbus, but the journey is by no means over. The airline has a tough delivery schedule ahead to fulfil its 185 orders to 15 customers (see figures below). Next year it plans to deliver 13, a further 25 in 2009 and 45 in 2010. Tom Enders, Airbus' CEO doesn't underestimate the scale of challenge ahead. ""This is not a piece of cake,"" he told CNN, ""but we have learned our lessons and we are very confident today that we can deliver to our customers."" It hasn't just been Airbus that has been frantically preparing for the A380 launch. Airports around the world have had to make changes to runways and gates, as well as buy in new vehicles that can tow the giant aircraft and lift high enough to its upper decks. Seventy airports are now ready, Airbus has said. Singapore's Changi Airport, home to the Singapore Airlines A380 fleet, was the first, and when its new Terminal 3 opens early next year, 19 gates across the three terminals will be A380-ready with aerobridge access to both decks. Heathrow's new Terminal 5 will be able to handle four A380s at one time. British Airways, the Terminal's sole occupant, recently confirmed an order for 12 superjumbos and it now wants BAA to upgrade a satellite building to be built next to Terminal 5 to accommodate them. As Willie Walsh, BA's CEO told CNN, ""we want to make sure that development is built with the A380 in mind."" But whether the arrival of the A380 sets a standard for future air travel is still undecided. As CNN's Richard Quest points out, while these giant airplanes may be suitable for getting large numbers of people between key destinations quickly, demand could be even higher for the medium-size jets such as Boeing's up-coming 787 Dreamliner. As Richard Quest says, ""there's no doubt the A380 will sell, but it is going to take a long time to reach the 420 sales which is the amount Airbus needs to make money."" But those worries, he adds, are for another day. Thursday was a day for celebration. SOME KEY FIGURES . Orders . Total: 185 orders (165 firm orders) 15 customers .

"(CNN) -- Lionel Messi scored a record 50th goal this season as Barcelona bounced back from midweek Spanish Cup heartache to maintain an eight-point lead in La Liga on Saturday. The two-time world player of the year became the first player to reach the half-century mark in a Spanish season as he moved past Real Madrid's Hungarian legend Ferenc Puskas in a 2-0 win over Osasuna. The 23-year-old scored 47 in all competitions last season, matching Brazil legend Ronaldo's Barcelona record. With arch-rivals Real Madrid following up Wednesday's extra-time Copa del Rey triumph by thrashing third-placed Valencia 6-3 earlier, the pressure was on Barcelona to respond. Coach Pep Guardiola followed Real's Jose Mourinho in fielding a much-changed line-up ahead of Wednesday's Champions League semifinal first leg between the two teams in Madrid. Real star Ramos laughs off trophy blunder . But while Messi started on the bench, David Villa retained his place up front -- and it was the Spain striker who broke the deadlock in the 24th minute when he scored his first goal since February. Villa slid home at the far post to convert a superb low cross from the left by Jeffren for his 18th league goal this season, and first in 11 matches. Xavi, Andres Iniesta and Messi came on in the second half, and the Argentina forward -- who replaced Villa -- settled the match with three minutes to play after being set up by Dani Alves. The victory left Barca on course for a third straight title with five matches to play, while Osasuna remained two points above the relegation zone. Real got the better of Barca for the first time this season with a strong defensive effort in Valencia, but went all guns blazing in Saturday's return to the Mestalla. Is Mourinho the master of mind games? Argentina striker Gonzalo Higuain scored a hat-trick and Brazil star Kaka netted twice in a match that Madrid led 5-0 after 53 minutes. France striker Karim Benzema opened the floodgates in the 23rd minute, and Higuain had completed his treble by the time in-form striker Roberto Soldado pulled one back on the hour for Valencia. But Kaka, who set up two of Higuain's efforts, restored Real's five-goal advantage with a superb solo burst into the box just two minutes later. Valencia threatened a late comeback when Jonas and substitute Jordi Alba scored in the last 10 minutes, but the match highlighted the gulf of class in Spain with Real moving 17 points clear of the home team. In Saturday's late match, fifth-placed Athletic Bilbao beat Basque rivals Real Sociedad 2-1 to move five points clear of Sevilla, who host Champions League hopefuls Villarreal on Sunday. Teenager Iker Muniain and Gaizka Toquero scored inside the opening half hour, but an own-goal by Javi Martinez soon after the latter's effort gave the 13th-placed visitors hope.","Barcelona eight points clear in Spain as Lionel Messi scores record 50th goal of season .

"(CNN) -- A travel website on Saturday flashed the word ""CANCELED"" in blinking red letters across an online flight schedule for Missouri's largest airport after a rash of severe weather stranded travelers across the region. Lambert-St. Louis International Airport, the country's 30th busiest, was closed after a tornado struck the facility on Friday, but officials expect it to reopen Sunday. ""All departing and arriving flights are canceled until further notice pending full safety assessments of airport facilities,"" the airport website said Saturday. St. Louis-bound flights were diverted to neighboring airports as a result of the storms, including more than a dozen flights to Kansas City International Airport, according to airport spokesman Joe McBride. Rerouted passengers were put up in hotels, and at least three airlines tried to accommodate frustrated travelers on Saturday by busing them from Kansas City to St. Louis, he said. See iReporter's shots of airport damage . Airport Director Rhonda Hamm-Niebruegge said an American Airlines 757 jet suffered significant damage and four other American aircraft had minor damage. Friday night, lines of weary passengers wrapped around airport car rental centers in a frantic attempt to find alternate transportation. ""It was pretty crazy,"" said Enterprise employee Daniel Tighe. ""People were getting into Kansas City just to figure out that their flight had been canceled. ""We took in 30 walk-in reservations just last night,"" he added. ""Plus it's the holiday weekend."" By Saturday the influx of one-way car reservations had abated as rerouted passengers made their way to St. Louis. ""We had quite a few runs to the Greyhound bus station and train station downtown,"" said Chris Bos, an employee for Nick & Nino's taxi service in Kansas City. ""Most people didn't complain. There's not much else they could do."" AirTran said it will fly its St. Louis-bound passengers to Bloomington, Illinois, or Kansas City, Missouri, according to company spokesman Christopher White. But potential thunderstorms and flooding still loomed over the St. Louis area by Saturday afternoon, the National Weather Service said. Major damage was evident in nearby communities, where an estimated 30,000 homes were without power. See iReport images from elsewhere in Missouri . Meanwhile, 30-minute delays lingered at Chicago's Midway and O'Hare airports, where severe storms prompted more than 500 flight cancellations Friday, according to Karen Pride, a spokeswoman for the city's Department of Aviation.","Rerouted passengers are put up in hotels .

"Washington (CNN) -- U.S. government experts trying to construct a model of radiation plumes emanating from Japan's Fukushima Daiichi power plant are being hampered by a ""paucity of good data,"" a senior administration official told CNN. ""We have done some (computer) modeling,"" the official said, noting the government ""got a little bit of data"" when helicopters from the USS Ronald Reagan encountered low levels of radiation during flights in the area. But information has been scant, the official said, adding, ""Garbage in, garbage out."" The official spoke on background because he was not authorized to speak publicly. Experts use computer models of plumes to both track radioactivity or other harmful releases and predict their paths. U.S. officials as well as industry officials and critics say radiation from Fukushima Daiichi will not pose a significant health threat to the United States. But plumes could be a factor in causing flight and maritime restrictions. The official said the United States is sending 39 people and 17,200 pounds of equipment to Japan to assist in efforts to bring the reactors under control. Among the gear is aerial measuring capability to provide radiation readings. He stressed the importance of getting ""boots on the ground"" to get good data. From the first hours of the incident, the president's chief Homeland Security adviser, John Brennan, along with personnel from the Department of Energy, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and other agencies have been maintaining close contacts ""as best we could"" with people on the ground in Japan, the official said. Officials have been drawing on a variety of sources for information, including both official and personal contacts in Japan, and open-source material, such as public statements from the Japanese government and Tokyo Electric Power Company web sites. At the Department of Energy, a nuclear incident team has been monitoring developments around the clock, he said. But data has been hard to come by, and there are ""conflicting reports"" about damage in some of the reactors, the official said. ""There's a lot of genuine confusion about what is going on,"" he said. U.S. officials also still do not know what caused the fire in Reactor 4 at the Fukushima Daiichi plant. There is concern that fuel rods in a spent fuel storage pool may have been exposed. That fire reportedly burned for two hours before being extinguished.","Data is scare on radioactivity coming from Japan's damaged reactors .

"Washington (CNN) -- U.S. Army Pfc. Bradley Manning, suspected of leaking classified information to the WikiLeaks website, is being moved to the Joint Regional Correctional Facility at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, defense officials said Tuesday. ""At this juncture of the case, given the likely continued period of pre-trial confinement, we have determined that the new pre-trial facility at Fort Leavenworth is the most appropriate one for Private Manning going forward,"" Defense Department General Counsel Jeh Johnson told reporters. A defense official initially told CNN Manning was moving to the U.S. Disciplinary Barracks at Fort Leavenworth, but later corrected that information. Manning, 23, a military intelligence analyst from Oklahoma, was being held in the brig at Quantico Marine Base south of Washington. There had been a push by friends and supporters to have his confinement conditions eased. Supporters said he was confined in a one-man cell with only one hour a day outside of the cell for exercise. Defense officials said at a briefing that an evaluation aimed at determining whether Manning is competent has been completed, and there was no need for him to remain in the Washington area. Among those arrested at a demonstration protesting Manning's conditions last month were Daniel Ellsberg, who leaked the Pentagon Papers in 1971 to the New York Times and retired U.S. Army Col. Ann Wright who resigned to protest the U.S. invasion of Iraq. Johnson told reporters that the decision to move Manning is not meant as a criticism of the Quantico facility and congratulated the military personnel there for the job they did ""in difficult circumstances."" ""We remain satisfied that Private Manning's pre-trial confinement at Quantico was in compliance with legal and regulatory standards in all respects,"" he said. Manning's case -- and the details of his detention -- drew attention last month in the aftermath of comments by former State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley and Crowley's sudden resignation. Amidst reports that Manning had been forced to sleep without clothing and was confined to his cell 23 hours a day, Crowley had criticized how Manning was held at Quantico, calling it ""ridiculous and counterproductive and stupid,"" according to news reports. He later stepped down from his post. The Pentagon has maintained that Manning is held in accordance with rules governing all maximum-custody detainees at Quantico, for his protection and the safety of others, and that Manning is on ""POI"" status, for ""prevention of injury."" Rep. Dennis Kucinich, D-Ohio, released a statement Tuesday after news of Manning's pending transfer broke, promising to demand written assurances from Defense Department officials that Manning's rights will be protected. ""Any move of Pfc. Manning does not change the underlying fact, which has not been disputed by the Department of Defense, that he has been held under conditions which may in fact constitute 'cruel and unusual punishment' in violation of the 8th amendment,"" he wrote. U.S. military officials have told CNN that Manning is the prime suspect in the leak of hundreds of thousands of classified documents that ended up on the WikiLeaks website. He is awaiting a decision on whether he will face a court martial. Last month, the Army notified Manning that he faces 22 more charges in connection with the alleged downloading of secret information from computers in Iraq, bringing to 34 the total charges in the case. The most serious new charge alleges he aided the enemy by making the information public; that charge is punishable by death. A statement from the Army said the prosecution team ""has notified the defense that the prosecution will not recommend the death penalty,"" but technically it is up to the commander overseeing the case to make the final decision.","NEW: The decision is not meant as a criticism of the Quantico facility, an official says .

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- Three civilians and a police officer were killed Wednesday after militants fired two rockets at security checkpoints in Pakistan's western city of Quetta. Police spokesman Abdullah Afridi said militants fired the rockets along Saryab Road, injuring an additional 15 people. Earlier this month, four civilians were killed and 10 were injured when a bomb exploded near a security patrol in Pakistan's Balochistan province, police told CNN. Balochistan has long been plagued by sectarian violence between Sunnis and Shias, and separatist Baloch militant groups who demand political autonomy. Quetta, Balochistan's provincial capital, is widely believed to be a safe haven for senior leaders of the Afghan Taliban, but rarely are militant attacks in Balochistan linked to them.","3 civilians and a police officer were killed Wednesday in a rocket attack .

"(CNN) -- It's his first trip to South America, one that many doubted would happen at all. President Obama's five-day tour to Brazil, Chile and El Salvador happens as a nuclear and humanitarian crisis unfolds in Japan after a powerful earthquake and tsunami hit the island. And a civil war rages on in Libya, threatening stability in the Middle East. The United States is getting involved in a third conflict in the region in addition to Afghanistan and Iraq. That's why many speculated that Obama would either cancel or postpone his Latin American trip. In his weekly internet and radio address, Obama spoke about the reasons why he's looking south. ""As we respond to these immediate crises abroad, we also will not let up in our effort to tackle the pressing, ongoing challenges facing our country, including accelerating economic growth,"" he said as he made the case for economic opportunities for U.S. businesses in Latin America. Analysts say the United States can't afford to ignore Latin America in spite of the challenges in Asia and the Middle East. China, not the United States, is now the largest destination for Brazilian exports. And former Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva defied most countries on the U.N. Security Council last year (and certainly the United States) on the issue of sanctions against Iran for its nuclear program. In recent years, Brazil has discovered oil reserves off the coast of Rio de Janeiro that could be the largest in the world if the estimates of Petrobras (the state-owned Brazilian oil company) are right. Add to that the fact that Brazil is hosting the World Cup in 2014 and the Olympics in 2016, and it becomes a logical choice for a country to be visited by an American president. That's why Cynthia Arnson, director of the Latin American program at the Woodrow Wilson Center in Washington, calls Brazil ""the obvious country on the itinerary."" She said Brazil ""is, depending on whose numbers you use, anywhere from the fifth to the eighth economy in the world. It is a global player on issues like climate change, environmental preservation, innovation and biofuels development. It's also seeking a permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council."" Chile, considered an economic Latin American success, will be Obama's second stop. A devastating earthquake that hit the country in February of last year had little effect, if any, on its booming economy. Gross domestic product grew more than 5% in 2010, in spite of the catastrophic 8.8-magnitude temblor, one of the 10 most powerful earthquakes on record. Chile signed a free trade agreement with the United States on January 1, 2004, and its government claims to have more such agreements than any other country in the world, with pacts signed with the European Union, Mercosur, China, India, South Korea, and Mexico. (Mercosur, or the Southern Common Market, is an economic agreement that promotes free trade among Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay.) With a mixture of open market policies and strong economic institutions, Chile has dramatically reduced poverty. Only 18.2% of the population lived below the poverty line in 2009, compared with nearly 40% 20 years ago. ""The center-right government of [President] Sebastian Piñera has by no means done away with the social programs put in place under the Concertación [a coalition of center-left political parties] that were so successful in reducing poverty in Chile,"" Arnson said. El Salvador, Obama's third stop of the tour, is also a success story, although on a much lesser scale. Arnson says that in a relatively short period of time, the Central American country has managed to professionalize and downsize its army and establish a system of political competition in which everyone agrees on the rules of the game (a great achievement when one takes into account that El Salvador was ravaged by a civil war that lasted from 1979 to 1992). ""They are not the only success stories, but they're very important success stories in all three countries. El Salvador came out of civil war, Brazil and Chile came out of decades of military dictatorship, and there's been significant progress in all three countries in moving away from that past,"" Arnson said. For Kevin Casas-Zamora, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution in Washington, El Salvador is important for the White House for other reasons as well. ""In El Salvador converge in a very clear way three issues that are crucial when it comes to the relation between the United States and Latin American countries: migration, trade and security,"" Casas-Zamora said. More than 2.5 million Salvadorans live in the United States, and the government of President Mauricio Funes wants a resolution on their immigration status. As Mexico has scored important victories against major drug cartels, these criminal organizations have moved into Central American countries, including El Salvador. According to Casas-Zamora, El Salvador is looking for a closer partnership with the United States to increase its security. ""So far, the U.S. government has earmarked $100 million [to boost security] for fiscal year 2011, which is quite limited. This amount of money for the Central American region is minuscule, compared to the magnitude of the drug trafficking problem they face,"" Casas-Zamora said.","Obama visiting Brazil, Chile, El Salvador amid war in Mideast, post-quake crisis in Japan .

"Lagos, Nigeria (CNN) -- Concerned about ongoing violence, Nigerian election officials Thursday delayed gubernatorial elections in two states. Voters in Kaduna and Bauchi states will now go to the polls on April 28, said Attahiru M. Jega, chairman of the Independent National Electoral Commission. Elections will continue April 26 in other states. ""This is to allow for further cooling of tempers and for the security situation in those states to improve,"" Jega said. The development came after Goodluck Jonathan, who was declared the winner in the recent presidential election, warned perpetrators of postelection violence that ""enough is enough. He said the unrest in a series of elections brings back memories of events leading up to a 1960s civil war in the nation. Jonathan, who ran as the incumbent, hails from the oil-rich southern region, which is majority Christian. Parts of the mostly Muslim north charged the elections were rigged. Armed protesters in the region prowled the streets chanting the name of former military ruler Muhammadu Buhari, the main opposition frontrunner. ""We are shocked by these horrific acts, which strike at the heart of our nation,"" Jonathan said in a statement Thursday. ""These acts of mayhem are sad reminders of the events which plunged our country into 30 months of an unfortunate civil war."" Muslims fearing reprisal attacks in Christian areas have fled to military barracks or neighboring states, the Nigerian Red Cross said. More than 40,000 people are displaced in the north, according to the aid group. Government officials have declined to release the number of fatalities or injuries over fears it could prompt revenge attacks. Jonathan urged protesters to avoid violence, saying ""enough is enough."" ""There are ... no grievances that our laws and courts cannot address,"" he said. Jonathan's warning comes two days after he pledged a ""new dawn"" for the nation following the vote hailed as a significant improvement from past polls. The last election four years ago was widely condemned for rampant vote rigging, violence, theft of ballot boxes and intimidation. While Saturday's election was marred by violence, reports of underage voting and other logistical problems, observers considered it an improvement. Action Congress of Nigeria, an opposition party, Thursday called the presidential election ""the most systematically rigged election in Nigeria's history"" and warned against a repeat in next week's gubernatorial elections. ''President Jonathan should call his dogs of war at the PDP (Peoples Democratic Party) to order, so that they will not push their luck by attempting to thwart the will of the people any more than they have already done, with the grim consequences that we all can now see,'' the party said. World leaders have urged the west African nation to probe allegations of ballot stuffing and unusually high turnout in some areas. Nigeria is Africa's largest oil producer and its most populous nation with 150 million people.","NEW: Electoral commission postpones voting in two states .

"(CNN) -- While most first-person shooter games want players to kill as a means of completing a mission,""Bulletstorm"" takes that premise to the next level by having players ""kill with skill."" The new first-person shooter from Epic Games, People Can Fly and Electronic Arts ends up being a campy, over-the-top offering, featuring a new game play style that awards points for killing enemies in unique ways. The more outlandishly someone dies, the more skillshot points you get. You play as Grayson Hunt, an assassin-turned-mercenary who is on a mission to redeem himself by going after the people who used him to kill innocents. Sound convoluted? There are enough twists, turns, betrayals and unlikely partnerships that it feels like you will end up targeting everyone at some point in the game. That mounting body count, which is the game's true lead character, isn't just about using different weapons to off your opponents, but includes using the environment around you to deal death blows. Spiked cacti and steel beams become your friends for the ""Spiked"" or ""Voodoo Doll"" skillshot points. Kicking an opponent off a high platform earns you the ""Vertigo"" skillshot points. Players can cash in the points for upgrades to weapons and a special device called the Leash. It's a wrist device that shoots out an energy tendril, allowing Hunt to pull enemies or items toward him. You can also use the Thumper feature of the Leash to fling people into the air, where you can pick them off and earn ""Trap Shooting"" points. Hunt starts off the game with a standard assault rifle, but other weapons are found throughout the scenes. My favorite ended up being the Flail Gun, which fires off two bombs attached together by a chain. Wrap up an enemy, kick him into a crowd of bad guys, and then set off the bombs. It clears out a room quickly and will earn you points for the ""Gang Bang"" skill or the ""Grenade Gag"" skill. Get the idea? The more creatively a player uses his weapons and surroundings, the better his weapons become and the more destructive he can be. Instead of just mowing down enemy after enemy, I found myself taking a few extra moments to survey what was around me and how I could use it to destroy others. The wanton mayhem isn't the only thing that's over the top in ""Bulletstorm."" Dialogue is one obscenity after another in some of the most outlandish ways. Obviously, they are all NSFW (or for any real conversation), but they are laugh-out-loud funny if you keep your tongue firmly in your cheek. There is no real character development or even an attempt at real interaction between Hunt and the nonplayer characters that will help you along the way. Also, don't worry about trying to figure out where to go next. The nonplayer characters will lead the way and then stop right before heading into a danger zone. There are also indicators along the way (like a message telling you to press ""B"" to kick open a door) that lead the player by the hand through the linear game play. Single-player maps can be replayed after completion to see if you can improve your skillshot score in a timed setting. Multiplayer action ramps things up by introducing three team members to destroy the bad guys with you. The play is the same, but team skillshots are introduced to add a bit of spice. Cooperation is needed to move along, so play with people who will work with you rather than go off on their own. ""Bulletstorm"" is an entertaining attempt at making bloody fun with the skillshot feature. I think of it as a teenage shooter game that tries to get attention by being gross, obscene and sexually charged. It is funny at first, but after a while, it becomes tired -- especially the dialogue. But the shooting aspect is really something new and does keep interest levels high. Even toward the end of the game, I was still figuring out new combinations of weapons and environment that unlocked more new skillshot points. If you go into ""Bulletstorm"" thinking it is an elite first-person shooter game, you will be very disappointed. However, ""Bulletstorm,"" with its ""kill with skill"" mentality, is a great change of pace in the first-person shooter genre that rewards players for doing something different. And that is refreshing. ""Bulletstorm"" is now available on the Xbox 360, PlayStation 3 and PC. It is rated M for mature because of blood and gore, intense violence, partial nudity, sexual themes, strong language and use of alcohol. This review was done playing a retail copy on the Xbox 360.","""Bulletstorm"" follows Grayson Hunt, an assassin-turned-mercenary .

"Tokyo (CNN) -- Japanese officials' concerns over food contamination expanded beyond the country's borders Tuesday as tests detected radiation in ocean water offshore. Plant operator Tokyo Electric Power Co. said that high levels of radioactive substances were found in seawater near the plant, but said that the results did not represent a threat to human health. ""There should be no immediate health impact. If this situation continues for a long period of time, some impact can occur,"" Chief Cabinet Secretary Yukio Edano told reporters. The impact such radiation could have on marine life was unclear. Japanese authorities were scheduled to measure radioactivity in waters around the plant on Tuesday and Wednesday, the International Atomic Energy Agency said. Earlier seawater radiation monitoring detected levels of iodine-131 that were 126.7 times higher than government-set standards, the electric company said on its website. Its monitors detected cesium-134, which has a half-life of about two years, about 24.8 times higher than the government standards. Cesium-137 was found to be 16.5 times higher than the standard. The electric company detected these levels in seawater 100 meters (328 feet) south of the nuclear power plant Monday afternoon. Radioactive particles disperse in the ocean, and the farther away from the shore a sample is taken, the less concentrated the contamination should be. Because of the huge amount of dilution that happens in the ocean, there's not much chance of deep-water fish being tainted, said Murray McBride, a professor at Cornell University who studies soil and water contamination. ""I think the ocean can handle that a lot better than the physical environment and population centers,"" said Jim Walsh, an international security expert at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and a CNN consultant. ""We don't want any of this to happen, but better it go out to sea than stay in Japan."" Winds have largely blown radioactive material emitted by the plant offshore since an earthquake and tsunami crippled cooling systems at the plant March 11. But tests have detected contamination of food grown near the plant. The Japanese government has banned the sale of raw milk from Fukushima Prefecture, where the plant is located, and prohibited the sale of spinach from neighboring Ibaraki Prefecture after finding levels of radioactive iodine and cesium higher than government standards, the country's health ministry reported. And officials in Fukushima halted the distribution of locally grown vegetables outside the prefecture. The government has also banned sales of spinach and milk from parts of Gunma and Tochigi Prefectures, according to the prime minister's office. On Tuesday Edano said contamination had not been detected in other agricultural products. ""The products which are being grown in these areas are being monitored and the monitoring will continue,"" he said. He urged consumers to ""try not to panic,"" noting that the government had stopped shipments of any farm products they believed could be contaminated. Edano has stressed that officials believe the levels of radiation in food -- while above the legal standards -- do not pose any immediate health risk, saying they were mostly dangerous only if consumed repeatedly over one's lifetime. On Monday a spokesman for the World Health Organization said short-term exposure to food contaminated by radiation from Japan's damaged Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant poses no immediate health risk. Tests have also detected radiation in tap water. On Monday, authorities in the village of Iitake urged residents to avoid drinking tap water that tests showed contained more than three times the maximum standard of radioactive iodine. Water in other jurisdictions showed lesser signs of contamination, although far below levels of concern under Japanese law, according to the International Atomic Energy Agency website. The U.N. agency said it had received reports from Japan's government that six out of 46 samples tested positive for the iodine-131 radioactive isotope. Iodine and cesium isotopes are byproducts of nuclear fission in reactors such as the ones damaged in the March 11 earthquake and tsunami that devastated northern Honshu, Japan's main island. Although iodine-131 has a radioactive half-life of eight days, cesium-137's half-life is about 30 years. The decision to prohibit produce sales is another potentially devastating blow to a part of northeast Japan hit by the earthquake, tsunami and other potential fallout from the Fukushima plant. Edano has said farmers will be compensated for revenue lost by the restrictions. ""Primarily this is due to the nuclear reactor accident, so we assume (Tokyo Electric Power Company) will be held responsible for compensation. The government might take some supplementary action,"" he said. Fukushima ranks among Japan's top producer of fruits, vegetables and rice. Ibaraki, south of Fukushima, supplies Tokyo with a significant amount of fruits and vegetables and is Japan's third-largest pork producer. For radiation to be an issue for rice, the contamination would have to be more severe and prolonged that what has been seen so far, said McBride, the Cornell University professor. Soil contamination was a huge issue around Chernobyl, but the radiation emitted from the Fukushima Daiichi plant isn't anywhere near that level, he said. ""We're not at that stage; that's the scenario you have to consider if contamination gets severe enough,"" McBride said.

"London, England (CNN) -- A fishing ship whose crew had to be rescued from a fire is limping to port in the United Kingdom, the Maritime and Coastguard Agency told CNN Wednesday. Ninety-eight crew members were rescued from the Athena early Wednesday, while 13 remain on board to keep the fire under control and pilot the ship to port, the agency's Claire Johns said. The container ship Vega -- which happened to be nearby when the Athena caught fire -- is accompanying the ship to Falmouth, England, where both ships are due Thursday night, she said. The rescued crew members are aboard the Vega. The rescue operation was complicated by Athena's distance from land -- some 230 miles (370 kilometers) southwest of the British Isles of Scilly and 270 miles (435 kilometers) west of the Pointe Du Penmarche in Brittany, France. Because they can carry only so much fuel, British Royal Navy helicopters only had about 20 minutes over the rescue scene before having to return, according to the agency. A plane was also scrambled from France to help with communications during the rescue, the Coastguard said. The company that owns the ship does not know the cause of the fire yet, a representative said. ""Hopefully tomorrow when the firefighters come on board (it) will be completely extinguished and cleared and then we will know more about what happened,"" Sue Philbrow told CNN by e-mail from the Faroe Islands, where the ship is registered. Five ships responded to the emergency call to pick up crewmembers, who include Chinese, Russian, Peruvian and Scandinavian personnel, among others. The Athena is a fishing ship that processes fish on board. CNN's Eileen Hsieh and Richard Allen Greene contributed to this report .","NEW: The ship owner doesn't know the cause of the fire .

"Tokyo (CNN) -- In her cramped downtown office where wedding dress displays fight for space with file cabinets, Miyuki Uekusa has been busy answering the phone for the past month. ""Before the quake, many of our members were just thinking about marriage vaguely,"" said the professional matchmaker, whose agency Marry Me has sent 30 couples to the altar since it launched two years ago. ""After experiencing the tremors and repeatedly seeing the tragic images on TV, they felt the fear of being alone and wanted to find a partner in life."" As existing members turn more serious about going on dates, Uekusa says phone inquiries about joining her club have gone up 30% since the 9.0-magnitude earthquake and ensuing tsunami struck northeastern Japan on March 11, killing more than 14,000 people. On this Wednesday afternoon, a 49-year-old makeup artist -- who wants to be known simply as Yoko -- showed up at the Marry Me office to sign up as a new member. Despite the hefty price tag of a $1,200 sign-up fee and a $120 monthly charge, Yoko says the natural disasters and the subsequent nuclear crisis have jolted her into adjusting priorities in life. ""I need to act now, before another massive disaster strikes,"" she said. Experts are not surprised by the seemingly sudden change of heart on marriage, especially among women. ""In Japan, women take the initiative to get married -- and the trend for them had been to focus on their career and enjoy single life,"" explained Ritsuko Matsui, a prominent psychiatrist who counseled survivors of Japan's last devastating quake around Kobe in 1995, which left more than 6,000 people dead. ""Seeing heartwarming scenes of couples and families staying together in the face of recent tragedies has made many single women realize the importance of relationships."" This new appreciation has turned the wedding industry into an unlikely bright spot in the gloomy Japanese economy, as other sectors ranging from manufacturing to tourism struggle to recover. Jewelers -- big and small -- have reported strong sales of engagement and wedding rings, in sharp contrast to slumping demand for other luxury items. Koji Fujimoto owns Concept Jewelry Works, a Tokyo boutique that specializes in custom jewelry. He has seen a 20% jump in ring buyers since the disasters. ""After the quake, couples want to create something that commemorates their relationship and that they can hold forever,"" he said. At the Aldobrandini bridal shop a few blocks away, Maki Maruta echoes such sentiment. Trying on her Italian-made silk wedding gown for the first time, the bride says she will walk down the aisle on May 28 with a new sense of purpose. ""The disasters reminded me the importance of family,"" Maruta said. ""It's so important to have someone who is precious to you.""","Marriage industry is rare bright spot in Japan .

"Bulawayo, Zimbabwe (CNN) -- Zimbabwe's prime minister Thursday said the country will hold an election in ""12 months"" and he wants an outcome that can't be contested. ""In 12 months time we have an election in this country. Let it be free and let it be peaceful,"" said Morgan Tsvangirai, speaking in Bulawayo -- about 450km south-west of Harare -- to his Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) party supporters ahead of a congress set for Friday. At the congress new MDC leadership will be elected to prepare for general elections in which Tsvangirai will lock horns with President Robert Mugabe. Tsvangirai predicted the MDC will win, ending the coalition government that has ruled Zimbabwe since 2009. ""We are the next government of this country responsible to deal with unemployment which is over 85 percent. We have to resuscitate the economy and make it one of the best in Africa,"" added Tsvangirai. Tsvangirai and Mugabe formed a fragile coalition government in 2009 after a disputed, violent election in 2008. But the coalition has been marred by disagreements between the former political foes. ""People's will must be respected (in the next elections). The outcome of the polls must not be contested,"" said Tsvangirai. ""Robert Mugabe and Zanu PF took this country to its knees in 30 years. We have a duty in the next government to bring it back,"" added Tsvangirai, critical of his coalition partner and his party. Zimbabwe experienced a decade of negative economic growth before the formation of the coalition government, he noted. Mugabe has indicated that he wants an election this year to end the coalition government. But earlier this week, the country's finance minister said the economy was not performing well enough to finance an election this year. Kenyan Prime Minister Raila Odinga is expected to attend the MDC congress on Friday as ""the guest of honor"". Odinga, a fierce critic of Mugabe, was Kenya's opposition leader before joining President Mwai Kibaki in a 2008 power-sharing deal following contested elections that sparked tribal violence in that country. A similar deal was later agreed to in Zimbabwe by Tsvangirai and his long-time rival Mugabe. This will be the first time that Odinga has visited Zimbabwe since being appointed prime minister.","Tsvangirai seeks end of current coalition government .

"(CNN) -- On the first anniversary of an explosion on the Deepwater Horizon offshore drilling platform, which triggered the biggest oil disaster in U.S. history, BP filed suit Wednesday against the manufacturer of the rig platform's blowout preventer. ""BP has sued Cameron for its faulty design and manufacture of the blowout preventer (BOP) and its negligence in the maintenance and modification of the BOP, a critical safety device that failed to prevent the blowout of the Macondo well,"" BP spokesman Scott Dean said in a statement. ""When activated in a loss-of-control situation, a BOP, through one of its preventers known as the blind shear rams, is designed to cut through drill pipe that may be across the BOP and seal the well to contain the hydrocarbons and keep them from flowing to the rig,"" Dean said. A report released March 23 determined that the oil spill was caused by a piece of drill pipe trapped in the rig platform's blowout preventer, a device intended to stop oil from flowing into the Gulf. The report was commissioned by various U.S. agencies, including the Interior Department and the Department of Homeland Security. The Interior Department has said a much broader report that relies on additional sources of data, including eyewitness accounts and photos, will be released this summer. Meanwhile, officials in Louisiana Wednesday called on BP to make good on its promises to make everything right. ""We continue to call on BP to fulfill the promises of their ads,"" said Gov. Bobby Jindal. ""We continue to call on BP to truly make it right, here in Louisiana. We have 300 miles of our coast that continue to be oiled."" Jindal said he has called on BP ""not to wait five years, 10 years, 20 years,"" to make key payments as part of the Natural Resources Damage Assessment process. ""We know those payments could be hundreds of millions, maybe even billions of dollars. We again call on BP to make these payments within days, not weeks, not months ... so we can proceed with restoring our coast. ""We stood here with some leaders from BP toward the end of last year and they made promises -- promises about replanting oysters, promises about building a saltwater hatchery -- and those promises have still not been kept."" Jindal said he was also calling on both BP and the U.S. Coast Guard to continue to clean up the shoreline, noting that ""40% of the Louisiana coastline that had been oiled during this spill continue to be oiled today."" The oil spill has prompted a flood of lawsuits against BP, Transocean and Halliburton from a variety of plaintiffs, including owners of Gulf businesses who say they suffered heavy financial losses because of the spill. Transocean owned the Deepwater Horizon oil rig. Halliburton installed the rig's cement casing. The plaintiffs also include Transocean shareholders who contend the company falsely claimed it had remedied past safety problems with its blowout preventers before the Gulf spill. Dean said BP is filing suit ""as part of the legal process to ensure that all parties involved in the Macondo well are appropriately held accountable for their roles in contributing to the Deepwater Horizon accident."" Billy Nungesser, president of Plaquemines Parish, was among the officials joining Jindal at a news conference. ""We need to see the sense of urgency,"" Nungesser said. ""I stand here today, a year later, and I still can't look you in the eye and tell you who's in charge,"" he said, repeating a statement he made Tuesday night in an interview with CNN's ""In The Arena"" host Eliot Spitzer. ""We need to make sure we begin coastal restoration this week -- not next year, not the following year,"" Nungesser added. Jindal and other officials remembered the 11 people killed on the Deepwater Horizon, saying they were heroes. In a statement, BP Chief Executive Bob Dudley said, ""We remember 11 fellow workers and we deeply regret the loss of their lives."" The company said its thoughts are with their families, friends and colleagues. ""We also remember those who were injured and affected in other ways by the accident and the subsequent oil spill,"" Dudley said. ""We are committed to meet our obligations to those affected by this tragedy and we will continue our work to strengthen safety and risk management across BP."" On its website, BP lays out numerous steps it has taken, including payments made. The company says it paid nearly $400 million in response to more than 150,000 individual and business claims. It also paid $1.14 billion to federal, state and local governmental entities to cover claims, response and removal costs and payments. In 2010, BP paid $5 billion into a $20 billion trust designed to satisfy claims adjudicated by the Gulf Coast Claims Facility, and the company ""is committed to making additional payments of $1.25 billion each quarter until the end of 2013,"" it says. CNN's Eric Gershon contributed to this report.","NEW: BP claims blowout preventer had faulty design and manufacture .

"Bangkok, Thailand (CNN) -- Fighting raged on along the turbulent Thai-Cambodian border Friday, one day after a military source said local commanders from both sides had agreed to a cease-fire. Thai military spokesman Col. Sansern Kawekumnerd said Friday that another Thai soldier died and four soldiers were injured in the fighting. At least six Thai soldiers and one civilian have been killed in the clashes that started last week. Cambodia has said three of its troops have been killed in the fighting. The cease-fire agreed upon Thursday was forged at the unit commander level but not at the higher levels of the militaries, a Thai military source said. The source, who asked not to be named because he is not authorized to speak publicly, had said if peace persisted, higher-ranking commanders might meet on Friday. The commanders would be Thailand's 2nd Region commander, Lt. Gen Tawatchai Samutsakorn, and Lt. Gen. Chea Mon, Cambodia's 5th Army Region commander. Cambodia's government spokesman could not be reached for comment. Clashes between the two started April 22 as both sides accused each other of trying to seize ancient temples. Thailand calls the temples Ta Kwai and Ta Muen, while Cambodia calls them Ta Krabey and Ta Moan. Much of the border between the two countries remains in dispute. Both sides claim the disputed temples are in their country. Indonesia has offered to provide observers to the border area and help both sides resolve the crisis diplomatically. Thai Foreign Minister Kasit Piromya met with Indonesian Foreign Minister Marty Natalegawa in Jakarta, Indonesia, on Thursday. Indonesia holds the chair of the the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). Natalegawa also said Thailand welcomes the deployment of an Indonesian observer team to the disputed area. This idea was first agreed upon in an emergency meeting of ASEAN's Foreign Ministers in February, also in Jakarta. The observers have not been deployed, after Thailand later stated their presence was not needed. ""I just want to reassure that Thailand will work very earnestly and in a very serious manner with Indonesia in the role of Indonesia as a great facilitator,"" the Thai foreign minister said. United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has urged both nations to pursue ""an effective and verifiable cease-fire."" In February, fighting flared up along another disputed border area between the two nations, prompting the U.N. Security Council to issue a statement calling on both sides to implement a cease-fire. Those clashes stemmed from a longstanding conflict related to the 11th-century Preah Vihear temple. Both Cambodia and Thailand lay claim to the temple, which sits atop a cliff on Cambodian soil but has its most accessible entrance on the Thai side.

"Jakarta, Indonesia (CNN) -- The trial of 12 men charged in a deadly attack against a minority Muslim sect began Tuesday under heavy security in West Java. ""We deployed about 1,095 personnel,"" said Senior Commissioner Budiarto, the operations head of the police department in Banten province. Two water cannons and three armored vehicles were also on standby. Budiarto, like many in Indonesia, go by one name. Hundreds of people, mostly students from nearby Islamic boarding schools, prayed and chanted outside the courthouse in support of the defendants. The men are on trial for a February 6 incident in which a mob of about 1,000 people, wielding knives and stones, attacked about 25 members of the Muslim minority sect, Ahmadiyah, in Cikeusik village in the province. Three people were killed and six others injured. The crowd opposed the presence of the Ahmadiyah in the village and demanded the group stop its activities. Amateur video of the incident obtained by Human Rights Watch showed people pummeling what looked like lifeless bodies with sticks and rocks. The video has been posted on the Internet, fueling public outrage. In a televised statement, Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono condemned the violence against Ahmadiyah and ordered a thorough investigation. Human rights activists, however, have called on the government to revoke a ministerial decree issued in 2008 that bans the community's religious activities. Many Muslims consider the Ahmadiyah a deviation from the orthodox Islamic faith. Followers of Ahmadiyah believe Mirza Ghulam Ahmad, the founder of the religious movement in India, was Islam's last prophet. Orthodox Muslims say Mohammed was the last prophet. The Setara Institute for Peace and Democracy, a local think tank, noted in a recent report a marked increase in the number of attacks against Ahmadiyah and other minority religions in Indonesia in recent years. The most populous Muslim country in the world, Indonesia has previously been touted as an example of tolerance and democracy in the Islamic world. But a 2009 study from the Pew Forum on Religion & Public Life in Washington suggested it was actually among the most restrictive countries when it comes to religion. Last week, Human Rights Watch issued a statement, urging authorities to ensure proper security at the trial. ""For the Cikeusik trial to be a step toward ending religious violence in Indonesia, the police need to ensure the security of everyone in the courtroom,"" said Elaine Pearson, deputy Asia director at Human Rights Watch. ""Witnesses brave enough to testify, as well as judges and prosecutors, should not have to face intimidation.""","Hundreds chant outside the courthouse in support of the defendants .

"London (CNN) -- Piracy, mostly in the dangerous waters near Somalia, has surged this year and may be at an all-time high, according to a new report Thursday. There have been 142 pirate attacks worldwide in the first three months of this year, according to the report from the International Chamber of Commerce's International Maritime Bureau. And 97 of the attacks came off the coast of Somalia, the organization said. ""Figures for piracy and armed robbery at sea in the past three months are higher than we've ever recorded in the first quarter of any past year,"" said Pottengal Mukundan, director of bureau that has monitored piracy since 1991. During these attacks, 18 vessels were hijacked and 344 crew members were taken hostage. In the first three months of 2011, seven crew members have been killed and 34 injured, according to the report. One of the deadly attacks occurred in February when four Americans were killed after Somali pirates hijacked their 58-foot yacht off the coast of Oman. U.S. prosecutors announced this week that they had indicted a man believed to be one of the leaders of that pirate attack.","Most of the pirate attacks are occurring near Somalia, group says .

Federal police captured Victor Manuel Felix, alias ""El Senor,"" who worked for the Sinaloa cartel and was the leader of one of its financial networks, anti-drug police chief Ramon Eduardo Pequeno said. Felix is believed to be Chapo's ""consuegro"" -- a Spanish word for the father-in-law of one's son or daughter. Felix and seven others were captured in what was called Operation Beehive.  Some 500 kilos of cocaine and $500,000 were seized as a result of the arrests, which took place last Friday in the states of Jalisco and Quintana Roo, as well as in Mexico City, authorities said. Police from Mexico, Ecuador and Colombia worked jointly in the investigation that led to the arrests, Pequeno said. Guzman is one of Mexico's most-wanted drug kingpins, and has made Forbes Magazine's list of the world's billionaires, with a net worth of about $1 billion. The Mexican federal police investigation revealed those arrested participated in international drug trafficking and organized crime, police said. The agency conducted undercover operations that led to the discovery of the details of the illegal activities in Ecuador and Mexico. In the Ecuadorian city of Guayaquil, the organization had a cell comprised of members from Colombia, Ecuador and Mexico, who used various houses to gather and store drugs before shipping them to Mexico and the United States, the federal police said. Acting on this information, Ecuadorian police seized about four tons of cocaine and arrested nine suspects in Ecuador.","Police arrested Victor Manuel Felix and seven other members of the Sinaloa cartel .

"(CNN) -- Letters by a teenage Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy Onassis to her Harvard boyfriend in the late 1940s show the future first lady writing about adolescent love, kissing and her loathing of attending a finishing school. The 22 letters and a printed telegram are being auctioned by Christie's, which estimates the value between $25,000 and $35,000. The auction house describes the writings as ""the earliest Jackie Kennedy letters,"" displaying ""a funny, spirited, at times cynical young woman, but one with great intelligence and a strong will of her own."" On October 10, 1946, the 17-year-old Miss Bouvier reveals her ""cooling enthusiasm"" in a letter to Harvard boyfriend R. Beverley Corbin Jr., ""who seems to have been badly hurt when Jackie refused to kiss him during one visit,"" according to Christie's. Corbin was 21 at the time. ""I do love you though -- and can love you without kissing you every time I see you and I hope you understand that,"" she declares. Then, on January 20, 1947, she writes to him about her definition of true love. ""I've always thought of being in love as being willing to do anything for the other person -- starve to buy them bread and not mind living in Siberia with them -- and I've always thought that every minute away from them would be hell -- so looking at it that (way) I guess I'm not in love with you,"" Onassis writes. Her last letter to him is undated, and it announces her engagement to John Husted. ""What I hope for you,"" she writes Corbin, ""is for the same thing to happen as quickly and as surely as it did with me. It will when you least expect it."" But that ill-fated engagement to Husted lasted only a few months in 1951, according to Christie's. Onassis died in 1994 in New York as one of the world's most famous women. She was 64. In an extraordinary life marked by staggering tragedy, she was the widowed first lady of assassinated President John F. Kennedy, slain in 1963, and became a widow again, of Greek shipping magnate Aristotle Onassis, who died in 1975. Corbin died in 2004 at age 79, according to the Social Security Death Index. The 75 pages of letters were written between 1945 and 1951 on personal stationery and the letterhead of Miss Porter's School, but in the letters, Onassis calls Porter's finishing school ""prison."" ""If school days are the happiest of your life, I'm hanging myself with my skip-rope tonight,"" the teenage Onassis writes to her boyfriend. In another letter, she pens of an upcoming Christmas break, when ""I can commute happily back and forth between my doting parents until they both get sick of me."" In an October 3, 1946, letter, she jokes about her schooling. ""I'm never going to send my children to boarding school,"" she writes. ""The boys can go to P.S. 148 with gangsters, and then go to Columbia & the girls can go to Hunter College and they'll all be morons but at least they wont have to tear around and get their teeth knocked out playing hockey every day. ... Can you think of anything worse than living in a small town like this all your life and competing to see which housewife could bake the best cake?"" The finishing school was in Farmington, Connecticut, a town where Corbin had resided at one time, a Christie's spokeswoman said. Onassis displays a mischievous side in a February 12, 1947, letter in which she tells Corbin to smuggle in cigarettes, chocolate ""and a hip flask to shock Mrs. J."" Many of the letters begin with ""Dearest Bev"" or ""Buddy darling,"" and one envelope, sent via ""air mail"" with three 3-cent stamps, is addressed to ""Mr. R. Beverley Corbin Jr."" of ""The Owl Club"" at Harvard University. The auction house is also selling an undated black-and-white photograph of Onassis and Corbin along with another couple. The auction is set for May 19. CNN's Amy Roberts contributed to this report.","Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy Onassis was a teenager when she had a Harvard boyfriend .

"(CNN) -- Bosnian striker Edin Dzeko finally broke his English Premier League duck for Manchester City, as his goal helped Roberto Mancini's side to a 1-0 victory at Blackburn Rovers. Dzeko moved to City from German club Wolfsburg in January for a fee reported to be in the region of $44.5 million but had gone nine league games without scoring before the trip to Ewood Park. His close range 75th minute winner saw City pull four points clear of Tottenham in the fourth qualification slot for the lucrative Champions League tournament, while Rovers slipped deeper into relegation trouble. Manager Steve Kean's side are now just one point above the drop zone, and have now gone ten games without a win. After the game Dzeko told Sky Sports: ""I'm very happy that this goal helped my team to win the game. Maybe this was one of the most important goals in the last month. I think it is a new beginning for me at City."" City dominated the first half, with Spain international David Silva hitting the post with only three minutes on the clock. England international Gareth Barry then had a header cleared off the line by ex-Real Madrid defender Michel Salgado before Rovers' striker Jason Roberts claimed a penalty after what looked like a trip by Vincent Kompany. Aleksandar Kolarov tested Blackburn's goal when he sent a dipping shot narrowly over the bar. Rovers' best chance came when Zimbabwean striker Benjani headed over from 12 yards. Rovers were far better in the second half and put City under intense pressure but couldn't find a breakthrough, and they were made to pay when Dzeko came on as a substitute. He'd only been on the field for three minutes before a Silva cross was deflected into his path and he guided the ball high into the net from eight yards out. Martin Olsson forced City keeper Joe Hart into an injury time save from a fiercely hit free kick, but Mancini's side held out until the final whistle for their second win in a row after they defeated bitter rivals Manchester United in the FA Cup semifinal. In Spain, Real Zaragoza climbed out of the relegation zone in La Liga with a crucial 1-0 win over rock-bottom Almeria. Diego Alves was the unlucky party, as Florent Sinama-Pongolle's shot hit the post, then the Almeria keeper and bounced back into the net. Zaragoza move into 16th, one point above the drop zone, while Almeria are now nine points adrift of safety.","Edin Dzeko breaks his Premier League duck as Man City beat Blackburn 1-0 .

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- The head of a Kandahar prison where a mass escape occurred this week was among 20 people arrested Thursday on suspicion of assisting the jailbreak, a senior prison official told CNN. Suspicions have run high that -- given the ease and scale of the escape -- there was some inside help at the prison. Guards as well as officials on duty during the night of the escape were arrested. ""The escape of the prisoners are not possible without authorities' cooperation,"" said Gen. Amir Mohammad Jamshid, the chief director of jails in Afghanistan. Ghulam Dastagher Mayar, the chief director of the Kandahar jail, is among the arrested officials. Monday's break was the second escape at the prison in three years. In 2008, as many as 1,000 prisoners -- nearly half of them Taliban members -- escaped after militants detonated a truck bomb against the side of the prison compound. Afghan authorities said Tuesday they have recaptured 65 of the more than several hundred inmates who slipped out of the prison through a nearly quarter-mile tunnel dug beneath the compound. A massive search operation continues to find the others -- many of them insurgent fighters, said the Kandahar governor's office. The Taliban issued a statement taking responsibility for the escape from the prison in Kandahar, the Taliban's birthplace. Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahed said digging the tunnel took five months. The escape took four and a half hours, he said. The Taliban claimed 541 prisoners escaped. The NATO-led International Security Assistance Force said the number of escaped prisoners was closer to 470. The Taliban said 106 of the escapees were military commanders, but there was no immediate government confirmation of the claim. The prison houses some of the country's most dangerous Taliban prisoners, and the escape was an embarrassment for the Afghanistan government and its Western allies, said CNN National Security Analyst Peter Bergen.","Director of Kandahar's prison is among 20 held .

"New York (CNN) -- A Russian cargo pilot and his Nigerian broker were found guilty on Thursday of conspiring to traffic more than $100 million worth of cocaine into the United States and Europe from ports in West Africa. Federal prosecutors say Konstantin Yaroshenko, 42, and Chigbo Peter Umeh, 43, were arrested in Liberia in May after trying to bribe high-level Liberian government officials -- including the son of President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf -- in an effort to safeguard the route they used to bring Colombian cocaine to market. Sirleaf's son, the country's national security agency director, and his deputy had been working with the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency as undercover agents, unbeknownst to the two alleged traffickers, prosecutors said. The men were convicted on conspiracy charges related to at least three large trans-Atlantic shipments of cocaine that were to transit through Liberia, according to a statement from the U.S. attorney's office in New York. ""This is absolutely a trend we're seeing coming through West Africa and on to Europe,"" said Dawn Dearden, a spokeswoman for the DEA. She cited market incentives as a primary motivator for the shipments' meandering routes, often considered vulnerable to international scrutiny. ""What you can get for a kilo in Europe is a lot more than what you can sell it for in South America,"" said Dearden. Prosecutors say at least one 4,000-kilogram shipment -- itself worth more than $100 million -- was supplied by the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, commonly known as FARC, a leftist rebel group funded by way of narcotics sales and kidnappings. The cocaine, often grown in the FARC-controlled stretches of rebel-held Colombia, was to be first delivered to Venezuela before heading to Liberia, a way-station for further distribution. Prosecutors say the pair agreed to make payments in the form of cash and cocaine to facilitate the transfer of the narcotics for at least one shipment to New York by way of a commercial airline flight from Ghana. Umeh, who prosecutors said served as a broker between suppliers in South America and distributors in West Africa, faces a minimum of 20 years in federal prison. Yaroshenko, a pilot who -- according to the U.S. Justice Department -- transported thousand-kilogram quantities of cocaine through South America, Africa, and Europe, will face a minimum term of 10 years in federal prison. The 42-year-old-cargo pilot was held in the same pre-trial detention facility in New York as suspected Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout. The so-called 'Merchant of Death' is now in U.S. custody awaiting trial on charges that he agreed to sell millions of dollars of weapons to the FARC. Meanwhile, Russian officials have argued that Yaroshenko's apprehension and incarceration ""directly violate norms of international law."" ""We are talking about kidnapping of a Russian citizen on the territory of a third country,"" a Russian Foreign Ministry statement said in July. ""The actions of the U.S. special services at forcibly and secretly transferring of our citizen from Monrovia (Liberia) to New York can be qualified as outright lawlessness."" Yaroshenko's arrest marks the first prisoner transfer from Liberia to the United States in connection with a narcotics-related charge in more than three decades, according to the U.S. Justice Department. The two men are scheduled to be sentenced in U.S. federal court in New York on July 28.","A Russian and a Nigerian were convicted in connection with $100 million worth of cocaine .

"Washington (CNN) -- Chinese President Hu Jintao wrapped up his visit to the U.S. capital Thursday, telling an audience of American business leaders that Beijing is seeking closer ties and greater trust with the United States on a range of issues. He sought to assuage concerns about China's rising economic and military power, declaring that his country ""will never seek hegemony or pursue an expansionist policy."" The Chinese leader was unapologetic, however, about Beijing's position on the politically sensitive status of Tibet and Taiwan, calling it a matter of Chinese territorial integrity and a ""core interest."" We are building ""a socialist country under the rule of law,"" he asserted. He said relations between Washington and Beijing need to be governed by a belief in ""equality"" and ""mutual respect."" Hu made his remarks at a luncheon hosted by the National Committee on U.S.-China Relations, the U.S.-China Business Council, and several other organizations. Earlier in the day, Hu traveled to Capitol Hill, where congressional leaders used the occasion to raise strong concerns about Beijing's commitment to human rights and economic issues such as the protection of intellectual property. Hu met with Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, and House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, among others. Neither man attended Wednesday night's White House state dinner in honor of the Chinese leader. Earlier in the week, Reid called Hu a ""dictator"" -- a word that was later recanted by his spokesman. Reid refused to answer CNN's Dana Bash when she asked him what he expected ""to accomplish with a man you called a dictator."" Boehner noted that concerns related to tensions on the Korean peninsula also were raised during Thursday's talks. We had ""a good meeting,"" Boehner said. ""I would hope that the dialogue on all of these subjects would continue."" Disagreements over human rights -- including China's treatment of imprisoned Nobel Peace Prize Laureate Liu Xiaobo -- were ""raised very strongly,"" according to Rep. Howard Berman of California, the top Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee. ""I would not indicate there was great engagement ... other than a general recognition by the president of China that they have a ways to go,"" Berman told reporters. On Wednesday, Hu met with President Obama behind closed doors at the White House for several hours as top officials from both countries worked to address issues tied to the global economic crisis, international security, the environment and human rights. Obama administration officials used the president's meeting with Hu to highlight economic progress between the two countries, announcing Beijing's approval of $45 billion in new contracts for U.S. companies to export goods to China. The contracts will support an estimated 235,000 American jobs, according to the White House. The two leaders acknowledged continuing differences on human rights, but pledged to keep working on the matter in a ""frank and candid way,"" according to Obama. Human rights remains a touchy subject in China, as censors in the Asian nation made clear during Hu's visit by blacking out CNN's news broadcast each time the topic of human rights was mentioned. Even when Hu spoke about human rights, it was blacked out. Censors also blacked the network out in China whenever a CNN report mentioned or showed video of Liu. Footage of anti-China protesters near the White House was similarly blacked out. Obama has nevertheless hailed Hu's visit as a chance to lay a foundation for the next 30 years of Sino-American relations. ""At a time when some doubt the benefits of cooperation between the United States and China, this visit is ... a chance to demonstrate a simple truth,"" Obama said Wednesday. ""We have an enormous stake in each other's success. In an interconnected world, in a global economy, nations -- including our own -- will be more prosperous and more secure when we work together."" Hu declared the relationship between the two powers to be one of ""strategic significance and global influence."" Under ""new circumstances, and in the face of new challenges, China and the United States share broad common interests and important common responsibilities,"" he said. ""China and the United States should respect each other's choice of development path and each other's core interests."" The formal state dinner for Hu on Wednesday evening was the third such occasion of Obama's administration. Among the 225 dignitaries who attended were former presidents Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton; former secretaries of state Madeleine Albright, George Schultz and Henry Kissinger; Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer; actor Jackie Chan; Washington Gov. Christine Gregoire; and designer Vera Wang. Herbie Hancock and Lang Lang provided entertainment after the dinner. The last White House state dinner for China was in October 1997, when Clinton welcomed President Jiang Zemin and his wife, Wang Yeping. While Hu was at the White House, he joined Obama in a meeting with key business leaders. The list of corporate executives taking part in the discussion included Lloyd Blankfein of Goldman Sachs, HSBC's John Thornton, Intel's Paul Otellini, Motorola's Greg Brown, Microsoft's Steve Ballmer, GE's Jeff Immelt and Boeing's Jim McNerney. Hu later met with Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Vice President Joe Biden at the State Department. He was scheduled to head to Chicago on Thursday after the meetings on Capitol Hill. During a news conference with reporters Wednesday, Obama said he had received a promise from Hu to establish a more ""level playing field"" for U.S. trade. China's currency, Obama said, remains undervalued -- a key factor in America's trade imbalance with Beijing. The two countries need to develop a ""win-win situation as opposed to a win-lose situation,"" he said. Hu conceded that key differences remain over economic policy, but he promised that Beijing would continue making attempts to resolve those differences. Obama noted that he and Hu agreed on the need to reduce tension on the Korean peninsula and prevent further provocations from Pyongyang. A Korean peninsula with no nuclear weapons remains a key goal for both leaders, Obama stressed. Obama also defended his administration's decision to engage with China despite differences over hot-button issues such as human rights. Obama said that ""China has a different political system than we do"" and is at a ""different stage of development."" ""I have been very candid with President Hu about these issues,"" he told reporters, and ""occasionally, they are a source of tension."" Hu defended his country's human rights record, arguing that ""China recognizes and also respects the universality of human rights."" At the same time, he said, it is important to account for ""different national circumstances."" ""We will continue our efforts to improve the lives of the Chinese people"" and promote ""democracy and the rule of law,"" he said. But Washington, he indicated, should respect the principle of ""noninterference"" in domestic affairs.

"(CNN) -- Hopes for a Libyan cease-fire were raised briefly this week when it was announced that longtime leader Moammar Gadhafi had agreed, in principle, to the African Union's ""road map"" proposal for peace. Gadhafi's opposition later rejected the proposal, but its leaders said they would be open to any other proposals the African Union might make. African Union delegates join an international conference on Libya's future on Wednesday. Could the African Union be the key to peace in Libya? What is the African Union, anyway? Here's what you need to know: . 1. The African Union is relatively new.  The African Union was formed in 2002, replacing the Organization for African Unity, which had been in place since 1963. Its membership is composed of every African nation except Morocco, which withdrew from the OAU in 1984 because it took exception to the OAU's inclusion of the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic. ""The main overriding idea was to give more prominence to Africa, to make it an organization that had real teeth, that could push Africa on the international stage, that gave it a more unified voice to Africans,"" said Richard Downie, deputy director of the Africa Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. The diplomatic boost is just one of the reasons the African Union was created. Economic prosperity was another -- the African Union is working toward the formation of a central bank and its own currency similar to the euro -- and there was a desire for Africa to be able to respond to its own security crises with peacekeeping troops and humanitarian aid. ""The idea going forward is that the AU will take more of a lead in trying to come up with solutions to Africa's security problems rather than relying on the international community or the United Nations,"" Downie said. 2. The African Union has been more effective than its predecessor.  The African Union seems to have taken a much more active role than the Organization for African Unity ever did, implementing policies to reduce poverty and corruption. And one of if its most visible actions in recent years has been sending peacekeeping troops to Somalia and Darfur. The OAU had been criticized for sitting idly while humanitarian crises developed in Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of Congo. ""The general perception of the African Union is that it has been considerably more effective than its predecessor, particularly on peace and security questions,"" said John Campbell, the Ralph Bunche senior fellow for Africa policy studies at the Council on Foreign Relations. ""It's considerably more (of an) activist than its predecessor was."" Downie agrees that the African Union has been more successful, but that's not saying much considering the Organization for African Unity ""had a pretty awful reputation. Basically, it became a bit of a running joke as an organization that stood up for dictators."" 3. The African Union is struggling financially.  Maxwell Mkwezalamba, the African Union's commissioner for economic affairs, recently expressed concern about the organization's ability to pay peacekeepers in Somalia, Sudan and possibly Ivory Coast and North Africa if soldiers were ever needed there. ""The AU does not have adequate funds to finance soldiers in those countries,"" he told The East African newspaper this month. ""Our expenditure budget is currently constrained to meet the ever rising demand for intervention."" The African Union has had financial problems since its inception, Downie said. ""A lot of countries have either struggled to pay their fees to keep this thing running or just kind of accidentally forgotten to pay the fees at all,"" he said. Filling in the gaps have been a select few of the African Union's 53 members. It has been reported that five of the continent's most prosperous countries -- Algeria, Egypt, Libya, Nigeria and South Africa -- cover three-fourths of the group's budget. 4. When it comes to Gadhafi, the African Union might be biased. With Gadhafi funding such a large chunk of the African Union's running fees -- about 15 percent since the group was founded -- there's a bit of a conflict of interest, Downie said. Gadhafi's oil riches have also helped some of the same leaders who are on the five-man panel trying to negotiate a cease-fire. ""Some of these leaders are indebted to Gadhafi, and therefore maybe they're not the most honest brokers when it comes to negotiating a cease-fire,"" Downie said, using South Africa's Jacob Zuma as an example. Gadhafi funded South Africa's African National Congress for many years when it was a liberation movement fighting apartheid. Another thing to keep in mind is that Gadhafi, frustrated with the Organization for African Unity, helped lead the charge for the African Union when it was just getting started. He also served as its chairman for one year, from 2009 to 2010. So it might not be surprising if the African Union was to lean in his favor. ""Don't you think it's sort of interesting that in the case of Libya, the Arab League favored outside intervention to protect Libyans, and the African Union did not?"" Campbell asked. 5. The African Union is respected by many, but it still has much to prove. Outside Africa, Campbell said, many countries and international groups have a favorable opinion of the African Union. ""But remember, we're talking here about something like motherhood and apple pie -- in other words, everybody favors regional organizations, particularly regional organizations in Africa, that try to deal with peace and security questions,"" he said. The United States has an ambassador to the African Union, and Downie said that's proof that the group is ""gaining prominence and seriousness."" ""In diplomatic terms, this is an organization that you have to talk to and consider,"" he said. Although the financial problems are something to keep an eye on, especially without Gadhafi, the African Union has shown good intent and seems to be going in the right direction, Downie said. ""This is an organization that we will have to take more notice of in the coming years,"" he said.","The African Union's cease-fire proposal was rejected by the Libyan opposition Monday .

"Abidjan, Ivory Coast (CNN) -- The U.S. Embassy consular section in Abidjan may reopen Monday, but it initially will provide limited services, according to the State Department. The department continues to warn American citizens against traveling to Ivory Coast despite the arrest of former President Laurent Gbagbo, who defied calls to step down after an electoral commission declared he lost a presidential election in November to Alassane Ouattara. A violent power struggle followed the standoff, with supporters loyal to both sides taking to the streets in protests since December. Hundreds have been killed, according to the United Nations and the International Committee of the Red Cross. Ouattara has been recognized internationally as the legitimate winner. ""Contacting the Consular Section before making a visit would be prudent under the circumstances,"" the State Department said in a statement Thursday. ""We need to reiterate that because of the conditions in the country, the Embassy has severely diminished capacity to assist U.S. citizens and that in the event of a temporary flare-up in violence sheltering in place is often your best option."" The statement claims there are continued reports of lawlessness in various neighborhoods of Abidjan, the nation's largest city and commercial center.","Consular section expected to reopen on or about Monday .

"(CNN) -- The former leader of Ivory Coast may have to face international charges for alleged crimes committed during his time in office, President Alassane Ouattara announced Wednesday, as he outlined his plans to bring peace and security to his nation. Ouattara told reporters that he was setting up a Truth and Reconciliation Commission, similar to those created after civil wars or conflicts in other countries, in order to bring to justice anyone who committed atrocities during the most recent strife or even before that. ""Reconciliation can't be done without justice,"" Ouattara said in a news conference at the Golf Hotel, where he was holed up for months in the violent aftermath of the disputed presidential election. ""All Ivorians are equal in the eyes of the law, no matter their politics, their origin, their religion or their race,"" he said. Former President Laurent Gbagbo has been moved out of the Golf Hotel, where he was held after his arrest Monday, and is now under guard in a villa elsewhere in the country, Ouattara said. ""He is safe, and we will treat him with consideration,"" the president said. ""He is under house arrest in a villa. The president of the U.N. Security Council, Colombian Ambassador Nestor Osorio, said Wednesday that Gbagbo was taken to a presidential residence in the northern part of the country. ""We must respect his rights as a former leader, and make sure that the consideration he deserves due to his former title is truly respected, and of course that his physical safety and health is also preserved,"" Ouattara said. As for charges against Gbagbo, that will be up to the Ivorian justice minister, Ouattara said, adding that international counts would be determined by an international prosecutor. The president also vowed that even members of the Republican Forces -- the troops loyal to him -- who were found to have committed crimes would be brought to justice. ""All the soldiers -- even those in the Republican Forces -- identified as being pillagers will be dealt with,"" the president said, in response to a journalist's question about reports of Republican Forces troops participating in raids and pillaging in Abidjan. Human Rights Watch published a scathing report Saturday about abuses perpetrated by pro-Ouattara forces on their offensive to Abidjan. People interviewed by the monitoring agency ""described how, in village after village, pro-Ouattara forces summarily executed and raped perceived Gbagbo supporters in their homes, as they worked in the fields, as they fled or as they tried to hide in the bush."" ""Ouattara should fulfill his public pledge to investigate and prosecute abuses by both sides if Côte d'Ivoire is to emerge from this horrific period,"" said Daniel Bekele, Africa director at Human Rights Watch. Also under investigation is the massacre in the western Ivorian town of Duekoue, where the International Committee of the Red Cross said 800 people were slaughtered. The United Nations blamed many of the deaths on Ouattara's forces. Ouattara said the minister of justice has already begun a probe into those killings, the Human Rights Commission would be sending representatives in the next few days to look into the matter as well, and he has scheduled a meeting with the chief prosecutor for the International Criminal Court. ""I condemn this massacre,"" Ouattara said Wednesday. ""The people responsible for these killings, whoever they are, will be judged."" ""I am revolted, indignant at the number of dead,"" he added. As many as 27,500 people took refuge after the massacre in a Catholic mission in Duekoue, according to Amnesty International, and humanitarian conditions there are deteriorating rapidly. ""They are trapped in overcrowded and appalling conditions, having fled their homes after atrocious abuses were carried out by both parties to the conflict,"" said Véronique Aubert, Amnesty International's deputy director for Africa. The human rights group also warned that supporters of Gbagbo in Abidjan and elsewhere were at risk of violent reprisals following the former president's capture. One eyewitness reported to the group that a policeman belonging to Gbagbo's ethnic group was taken from his home and shot dead at point blank range, an Amnesty International statement said. ""Dozens of young people are going into hiding in Abidjan out of fear for their lives,"" Aubert said. ""In the western part of the country, people suspected of being pro-Gbagbo are also terrified. Many are hiding in the bush after their villages were burned down. They need to be protected."" On Wednesday, the International Rescue Committee said in a statement that rapes, sexual assaults, beatings and harassment of Ivorian women and girls by armed men had increased by ""alarming numbers."" ""Women and girls are being brutally raped by armed men, often in front of their family members,"" said Liz Pender, an IRC women's protection expert, who has been meeting with groups of Ivorian women and girls who fled to Liberia in recent weeks to escape the violence in their homeland. ""One woman told me she was forced to watch as several men took turns raping her sister, sometimes with a stick, and that she didn't survive the attack."" The refugee women who took part in Pender's group discussions said fear of rape or sexual slavery were the primary reasons they fled to Liberia, according to the IRC statement. It provided no details on the identities or political ties of the armed men carrying out the assaults. Ouattara has blamed much of the bloodshed in the aftermath of the election on forces loyal to Gbagbo, and said his government has begun a two-month program to root out weapons across the country. He's also demanded that the militia members and mercenaries who worked for the former leader surrender their arms immediately. But he faces a daunting task in forging a peaceful and stable path forward. Chief among his challenges, said longtime observers, will be to unite the severely divided nation and ensure justice for those who committed grave human rights violations in the nation's political vacuum -- including those in his own camp who stand accused of heinous acts. Most of the blame for the bloodshed rests squarely on the shoulders of Gbagbo, whose refusal to cede power plunged Ivory Coast into crisis, said Jendayi Frazer of the Council on Foreign Relations and a former U.S. assistant secretary of state for African Affairs under former President George W. Bush. The International Criminal Court in The Hague, Netherlands, is now poised to investigate alleged war crimes instigated by Gbagbo. Ouattara will have to delicately balance such a probe with reconciliation. After all, said expert Alex Vines, Ouattara did not win in a landslide. Gbagbo won 45.9 percent of the vote and as such, Ouattara will have to reach out to his rival's supporters, perhaps even welcome them into his government without jeopardizing justice, said Vines, head of the Africa program at the British think tank Chatham House. But even more significant may be the way Ouattara handles his own dirt. Though he emerged in the Western media as the good versus Gbagbo's evil, Ouattara, too, has been accused of having blood on his hands. In the United States, Ouattara's critics questioned his right to rule. ""It is now clear, based on U.N. reports coming from Cote d'Ivoire, that mass killings have occurred at the hands of Alassane Ouattara,"" Sen. Jim Inhofe, R-Oklahoma, said earlier this month. ""This calls into question his legitimacy to lead that country,"" said Inhofe, who has visited Ivory Coast nine times and made no secret of his support for Gbagbo. ""Ouattara is on a rampage, killing innocent civilians, and he must be stopped before this becomes another Rwanda."" Human rights lawyer Geoffrey Robertson said Ouattara's moment in the spotlight could quickly dim without adequate investigations into the abuse allegations against forces loyal to him. ""Mr. Ouattara should also be investigated because of the evidence that his troops did commit rapes and abuse en route to Abidjan,"" said Robertson, a former president of the U.N. special court for Sierra Leone. Such a probe could answer questions about what amount of control Ouattara exerted over the forces fighting under his name and whether he deliberately failed to stop them, Robertson said. In his favor, Ouattara has been viewed for some time as a hardworking man, an honest politician who favors transparency. He hailed from northern lands dominated by Muslim immigrants who came to work in Ivory Coast and eventually grew into influential businessmen and traders. The U.S.-educated Ouattara quit his International Monetary Fund job to run for president in 2000 and might have met Gbagbo on the ballot then, except that he was marked as an outsider -- his mother was from Burkina Faso -- and barred from participating in the election. The pro-Gbagbo newspaper Notre Voie accused Ouattara of backing a failed 2002 coup against Gbagbo's government, which triggered the 2002 civil war. Ouattara's critics blame him for the deep split that Ivory Coast has yet to mend. Vines said the rebels who fought in the 2002 civil war, the Force Nouvelles, formed a large part of the pro-Ouattara forces fighting Gbagbo's troops in the latest crisis. The United Nations has repeatedly cited the armed group for breaking the arms embargo imposed on Ivory Coast, and human rights groups have sounded alarms about its abuses. The moral high ground in Ivory Coast, said Vines, is that the election result is clear and in favor of Ouattara. ""After that it gets gray and in the last few weeks, it's gotten very opaque indeed,"" he said about the recent spate of killings, especially the massacre in Duekoue. Ouattara, said Robertson, must conduct a swift inquiry into the allegations and punish the perpetrators. Otherwise, Robertson said, Ouattara will ""himself be vulnerable to prosecution in The Hague.""","NEW: Sexual assaults by armed men increase, international agency says .

"Abidjan, Ivory Coast (CNN) -- The European Union announced a recovery package of 180 million euros for the Ivory Coast on Tuesday as residents of the African nation attempted to adjust to life with a clear leader and relative stability after months of bloodshed. Forces arrested former President Laurent Gbagbo after storming his residence on Monday. Gbagbo defied calls to step down after an electoral commission declared he lost a presidential election in November to Alassane Ouattara. Ouattara has been recognized internationally as the legitimate winner. A violent power struggle followed the standoff, with supporters loyal to both sides taking to the streets in protests since December. Hundreds have been killed, according to the United Nations and the International Committee of the Red Cross. Andris Piebalgs, EU commissioner for development, announced the recovery package on Tuesday. ""We will stand by Ivory Coast and its people by immediately starting to work with the government of President Ouattara to support him in getting the country on the right track towards reconciliation, democracy, economic recovery and sustainable development,"" he said. The funding will provide support to ensure basic needs for citizens such as health, water, sanitation and to support the agricultural sector, Piebalgs said in a statement. It also will clear the Ivory Coast's debt accumulated through the European Investment Bank. Top military brass pledged their support to Ouattara in a ceremony Tuesday at a hotel in Abdijan. Gen. Phillipe Mangou, Gbagbo's former army chief of staff, said on state television that the generals were received by Ouattara and given orders to take measures to restore order in the country. All security personnel should rejoin their posts Wednesday morning, Mangou said, to help the country return to normal. He also appealed to citizens who participated in the unrest to lay down their weapons and return to work, saying that those who fail to do so will be considered outlaws. The United Nations' World Food Programme said it was planning airlifts in the coming days ""to provide life-saving food assistance to tens of thousands of internally displaced people"" in Ivory Coast, as well as Ivorian refugees in neighboring Liberia. ""We need to open up a humanitarian lifeline to the many Ivorians who are now the victims of alarming shortages of food, water and other basic needs,"" said Josette Sheeran, World Food Programme executive director. The organization will airlift food from Niger and Mali into western Ivory Coast and Monrovia, Liberia, as part of a plan to transport 15,000 metric tons of cereals, vegetable oil and other items, it said in a statement. U.S. President Barack Obama called Ouattara on Tuesday ""to congratulate him on assuming his duties as the democratically elected president,"" the White House said in a statement. Obama offered Ouattara support in his efforts to unite the nation, restore security and the economy and reform the security forces, the statement said. In addition, ""the two leaders ... reiterated the importance of ensuring that alleged atrocities are investigated and that perpetrators -- regardless of which side they supported -- are held accountable for their actions"" in Ivory Coast, the White House said. The two also committed to support the United Nations commission of inquiry and the International Criminal Court in investigating abuses. Gbagbo rejected an offer to teach at an American university and have supporters in Ouattara's cabinet, as well as immunity from International Criminal Court prosecution, an African diplomat with knowledge of the situation told CNN Tuesday. Gbagbo had only 200 troops left and no way to restock the basement refuge of the presidential palace when he was captured, the source said, declining to be named discussing sensitive details. The Ivorian forces who stormed Gbagbo's residence could simply have thrown a grenade into the basement, but Ouattara had given specific instructions that he was not to be killed, the source said. ""Finally, we have reached the dawn of a new era of hope,"" Ouattara said in a televised address Monday. ""We had hoped this transfer had been different, but we have to focus on today."" Ouattara said he would set up a Truth and Reconciliation Commission to investigate allegations of human rights violations. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon welcomed Ouattara's plan for the commission, according to a statement from his spokesperson. In a phone call with Ouattara on Monday, Ban underlined the expectation that any further bloodshed will be avoided now that Gbagbo is in the hands of Ouattara's forces. ""The Secretary-General calls on all parties to work together to put an end to this tragic chapter, which could have been avoided had Mr. Gbagbo respected the will of the people at a far earlier stage,"" according to the statement. Ouattara urged his countrymen to lay down their weapons and said he has asked the justice minister to start legal proceedings against Gbagbo, his wife and his colleagues. Gbagbo was being held at the Golf Hotel, which has served as Ouattara's headquarters during the turmoil. Ouattara's government remains responsible for Gbagbo's physical safety, according to the U.N. statement. Gbagbo asked for and is receiving U.N. protection, according to Alain Le Roy, under-secretary-general of the U.N. Department of Peacekeeping Operations. Le Roy said forces are also ensuring the security of the former leader's wife. ""I understand from President Ouattara that he wants President Gbagbo to go on trial in Ivory Coast,"" said the U.N. official. Fighting largely ended soon after Gbagbo's arrest, Le Roy said. ""To my knowledge, most of the fighting has stopped,"" he said, adding that ""there are pockets of resistance here and there."" Le Roy -- along with the Ivory Coast's ambassador to the United Nations, Youssoufou Bamba, and the French Embassy -- said forces loyal to Ouattara made the arrest. Authorities are trying to move carefully and follow legal procedures to bring Gbagbo to trial, said a senior U.S. official with knowledge of the events. The official declined to be named because of the sensitivity of the situation. The arrest is a ""step in the right direction to return Ivory Coast to normality,"" the source said, adding that the city of Abidjan is a wreck, with ""death squads, militias roaming (and) burning bodies on the streets, which is posing a major humanitarian challenge."" The fighting left Abidjan with sporadic power and sanitation, and residents said dead bodies were left on the streets. Even after Gbagbo's arrest, Abidjan looked like a ghost city, with few venturing outside after all the violence. Parts of the city were still grappling with food and water shortages on Tuesday, but some signs of normalcy surfaced as traffic flowed on the streets. Speaking from inside the Golf Hotel, Gbagbo told his supporters to stop fighting. ""I hope that people lay down their weapons and return to a normal state of civil rule so that the crisis can conclude as quickly as possible,"" he said. Kenyan Prime Minister Raila Odinga, who served as the African Union's main negotiator in Ivory Coast, said he hopes Ouattara will be merciful as president. ""Gbagbo's capture should be a lesson to African leaders to respect the will of the people as expressed in the ballot,"" he said. ""I urge President Ouattara to be magnanimous in victory and grant him and his people amnesty."" Ouattara should also exercise inclusivity in the formation of his government, Odinga said. At least tens of thousands of people have fled into neighboring Liberia to escape the fighting, according to Oxfam, an international aid organization. The International Committee of the Red Cross said that 800 people had been shot dead in the western cocoa-producing town of Duekoue during the conflict. A U.N. official put the death toll at 330. Ban predicted last week that the outcome of the crisis in Ivory Coast would set the tone for other nations in Africa. ""What happens in Cote d'Ivoire has huge implications for the continent that will have 16 presidential elections this year,"" he said, using the French name for the country.

"Madrid, Spain (CNN) -- A total of 37 former Cuban political prisoners landed in Madrid on Friday from Havana, boosting to 115 the number of former Cuban prisoners who have come to Spain since last July, a Spanish Foreign Ministry statement said. The latest group includes Cuban dissident Orlando Fundora, arrested in 2003 among a well-known group of 75 dissidents. He was released later and has now decided to seek medical help in Madrid, said a Foreign Ministry diplomat, who by custom is not named. The other 36 released this week include dissident Nestor Rodriguez, the diplomat said. The latest arrivals are the last of a group of political prisoners whose release was negotiated last year among the Cuban and Spanish governments and the Cuban Catholic church, the statement said. Since July 2010, a total of 115 former Cuban prisoners and 647 of their relatives have arrived in Spain, the statement said. On Friday, the plane chartered by the Spanish government landed at 8 a.m. (2 a.m. ET) at Madrid's Barajas airport and carried the 37 former prisoners and 208 of their relatives. There was no news conference at the airport. Instead, non-governmental organizations that have helped the former prisoners with lodging boarded almost all of them and their families onto buses which headed to 15 destinations across Spain, including Barcelona and Malaga, the diplomat said. Centers in Madrid are already at capacity with other former prisoners, the diplomat said, and that's why most of the latest arrivals were sent elsewhere.","Latest group includes 37 former Cuban political prisoners and their relatives .

"Omagh, Northern Ireland (CNN) -- A Catholic police officer was killed in a blast on Saturday in Northern Ireland, said police and politicians at the scene. Police said an explosive device detonated under a car in the Highfield Close area of Omagh, Northern Ireland, in the afternoon. The victim -- Ronan Kerr -- was 25 years old and had recently joined the Police Service of Northern Ireland. ""Tonight, tragedy has returned to Omagh,"" PSNI Chief Constable Matt Baggott told reporters. ""I have no words to describe the awfulness of this afternoon, and my abhorrence and anger at this wasted life. And I know that anger and abhorrence is shared by all decent people in Northern Ireland and across Ireland and across the world."" Thirteen years ago, a bombing in Omagh killed 29 people and wounded more than 300. ""This heinous crime will not succeed in its evil intent of destroying the peaceful and democratic future to which the people of Northern Ireland are so clearly committed,"" said Irish President Mary McAleese. ""My thoughts and prayers are with his family, friends and colleagues at this time."" The head of the Catholic church in Ireland, Cardinal Sean Brady, similarly condemned the killing. ""The deliberate taking of innocent human life is always wrong,"" he said. ""I implore the perpetrators of this shameful killing to realise the futility of their actions, and to call off this senseless campaign."" Northern Ireland was the scene of frequent violence between pro-Irish and pro-British forces over a period of three decades. About 3,000 people were killed before a power-sharing deal known as the Good Friday Agreement was reached in 1998. Some dissident groups remain active.","The Irish president and the head of the Catholic church in Ireland offer their condolences .

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- Hundreds of inmates, many of them insurgent fighters, slipped out of a southern Afghanistan prison early Monday through a nearly quarter-mile tunnel dug beneath the compound from the outside. The Taliban issued a statement taking responsibility for the escape from the prison in Kandahar, the Taliban's birthplace. Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahed said digging the tunnel took five months. The escape took four and a half hours, he said. The Taliban claimed 541 prisoners escaped. The NATO-led International Security Assistance Force said the number of escaped prisoners was closer to 470. The Taliban said 106 of the escapees were military commanders, but there was no immediate government confirmation of the claim. Police recaptured eight of the escapees, the Kandahar governor's office said. Monday's break was the second dramatic escape at the prison in three years. In 2008, as many as 1,000 prisoners -- nearly half of them Taliban members -- escaped after militants detonated a truck bomb against the side of the prison compound. The prison houses some of the country's most dangerous Taliban prisoners, and the escape was an embarrassment for the Afghanistan government and its Western allies, according to CNN National Security Analyst Peter Bergen. ""It's, I think, quite a black eye for the U.S. and NATO and the Afghan government, who have put quite a lot of resources into trying to improve the prison systems, and here you have this massive prison break, with sadly, some pretty hardcore Taliban prisoners who escaped,"" he said. Waheed Omer, a spokesman for Afghan President Hamid Karzai, called the mass escape ""bad news and a disaster."" Although the Taliban said some of the escapees were military commanders, it's unlikely the escape will have a significant impact on military operations in Afghanistan, said Thomas E. Gouttierre, director of the Center of Afghanistan Studies at the University of Nebraska in Omaha. ""I don't think I would see this as a big blow to Western efforts in Afghanistan,"" he said. Instead, he said Afghanistan's government is likely to bear the brunt of criticism for failing to anticipate or prevent the escape, especially after previous escapes at this and other prisons. In the 2008 escape, militants used a truck loaded with about two tons of explosives and driven by suicide drivers to blast holes in the mud brick walls of the prison. A gun and rocket battle followed, lasting several hours and ending with militants rushing into the prison on motorcycles to free prisoners, according to Taliban accounts of the attack. Nine guards, seven prisoners and one civilian were killed in the attack, according to the provincial government. Security forces said they tried to track down the escaped prisoners, but said the large Taliban presence in the region and the numerous hideouts located there made it difficult to hunt down militants. Kandahar is the birthplace of the Taliban and has been the site of fierce fighting between international forces and insurgents. It has been the site of numerous anti-Western demonstrations, recently over the burning of the Quran, Islam's holy book, by a pastor in the United States. On April 15, the police chief of Kandahar province was killed when a man wearing a military uniform detonated a bomb at the entrance to the police headquarters. In February, 10 people died when mines exploded at a playground during a picnic hosted by a former police commander. In a separate incident, 19 people, including 15 police officers, died when armed attackers targeted police headquarters. After attacks on the country's ministry of defense, the assassination of the police chief and now Monday's prison break, Kandahar resident Kari Ghar said it's ""impossible to call this system a government."" ""This is the worst possible weakness of the Afghan government that almost every single political prisoners escape from the central jail in Kandahar,"" Ghar said. CNN's Nick Paton Walsh contributed to this report.","NEW: Kandahar resident: ""Impossible to call this system a government""

"Milan, Italy (CNN) -- Rescue crews continued their search Thursday for more than 200 people after the boat they were in capsized in the Mediterranean Sea. The boat was carrying about 300 people, survivors told rescue officials, according to Italian Coast Guard spokesman Cosimo Nicastro. It sank Tuesday about 62 kilometers (39 miles) west off Lampedusa in Maltese waters, the Italian Coast Guard said. By Thursday, officials had rescued 53 people, and recovered 15 to 20 bodies, he said. ""We are following with sorrow and concern what is happening in Lampedusa,"" Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi said. Many of the survivors came from African countries, such as Eritrea, Somalia and Niger, the Italian daily newspaper, Corriere della Sera said. Many others were fleeing the war in Libya, the newspaper said. The incident is the latest in a number of tragic ends in what has become a steady flow of people who set sail from Africa -- especially Tunisia -- to the Italian island of Lampedusa. According to Demetrios Papademetriou, president of the Migration Policy Institute, more than 22,000 migrants have landed on Lampedusa in the past few weeks. Though owned by Italy, Lampedusa's closest shore is Tunisia. ""Of course, it's a crisis, but the Europeans do not want to call it a migration crisis,"" he said. According to International Organization for Migration, the majority of unauthorized immigrants arriving in Lampedusa are Tunisian. Some 2,000 other African migrants have arrived on the island after sailing from the Libyan coast, the agency said. A popular uprising in Tunisia led to the ouster of its president, Zine al-Abedine Ben Ali, in January. While protesters succeeded in spurring a regime change there, many Tunisians are not seeing the kind of transformation they were imagining. Italy's foreign minister has estimated as many as 300,000 Libyans could try to leave and could potentially end up in his country. CNN's Mariano Castillo, Neil Curry and Lisa Sylvester contributed to this report.","Survivors say the boat was carrying about 300 people .

"Sanaa, Yemen (CNN) -- Five people were killed in clashes between rival forces in the Yemeni capital Sanaa as nationwide protests against the government continued Wednesday. Of the dead in Sanaa, two were loyal to Gen. Ali Muhsen Al-Ahmar, who has defected to the opposition, a government security official said. The other three were regime soldiers. Government forces were sending in armored vehicles as reinforcements to the demonstrations in Sanaa, the official said. Thousands of Yemenis took to the streets in Aden, Taiz, Hodeida and Dhamar. In addition to the dead in Sanaa, two people were killed in Aden, according to medical staff at the city's Naqeeb Hospital. Meanwhile, Yemen's attorney general threatened to resign unless the government went after the killers of anti-government protesters last month. Abdullah Al-Olufi said ""those who were responsible for killing almost 60 protesters and injuring hundreds of others should be identified and brought to justice soon."" ""If the security authorities don't identify those responsible for the massacre including those who were masked, I will step down,"" Al-Olufi said as public and external pressure mounts on President Ali Abdullah Saleh to step down. Protests erupted in Yemen this week despite an attempt by Persian Gulf nations to decrease tensions. The Gulf Cooperation Council has urged Saleh to transfer powers to his vice president, a move that falls short with the protesters who returned to the streets for marches. Opposition leaders vowed not to back down. The Joint Meeting Parties bloc, Yemen's largest opposition group, said the Gulf initiative ""does not clearly state that Saleh must step down and only focuses on Saleh's transferring power."" ""We all know the VP is not strong and will never be able to tell Saleh no, even if all his powers are transferred,"" said senior bloc official Hasan Zaid. Saleh, in power since 1978, said he welcomes the council's efforts to help resolve the political crisis in his country. He has said he intends to step down but only under a peaceful and constitutional transition process. He has already promised not to run in the next round of elections. The United States, which has been allied with the Saleh government in its fight against al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, has welcomed past Gulf council initiatives to resolve the crisis in Yemen. Journalist Hakim Almasmari contributed to this report.","In all, seven deaths are reported in clashes that erupted nationwide .

"(CNN) -- Police in New Hampshire are searching for a missing mother after her baby daughter was discovered in an abandoned car with its engine running and hazard lights flashing, authorities said. Krista Dittmeyer, 20, has not been seen since Saturday, when the 14-month-old was found alone in her car, parked in the parking lot of a ski area at Mount Cranmore, New Hampshire, according to Conway, New Hampshire, police spokesman Christopher Perley. The car was discovered early Saturday morning by an unidentified passerby who noticed the flashing hazard lights. When the witness ""approached the car, they found that it was unoccupied, it was running, the driver's door was slightly ajar and there was a baby in the back seat,"" Perley told reporters Monday. The witness alerted police and the baby was taken to nearby Memorial Hospital, where it was determined to be in good health and then reunited with its grandmother, Perley said. Police also conducted a thorough search using fire and rescue personnel, New Hampshire Fish and Game staffers and police dogs. A murky pond has been drained and an air search was conducted Monday with no sign of Dittmeyer, Perley said. ""We don't have any information that leads us to believe that she's not alive, and we're going to continue to investigate as if we can reunite her with her family,"" Perley said in a Monday press conference. Dittmeyer, who lived with roommates in Portland, Maine, had no history of mental illness and no criminal record, Perley said. ""She would never, ever, ever, leave her in a car by herself,"" Dittmeyer's friend Kathy Pratt told CNN affiliate WMUR, referring to Dittmeyer's daughter. Dittmeyer, who last spoke with her family at 8 p.m. on Friday, has friends in the North Conway area. ""We know that she would do whatever it takes to get back here and be with her daughter,"" her sister, Kayla Dittmeyer, told WMUR. Police are testing physical evidence found at the scene, along with two vehicles -- one of them Krista Dittmeyer's black Nissan Sentra, Perley said in the press conference. Authorities are also executing multiple search warrants and applying for a warrant for Dittmeyer's cell phone records, he said. ""We are mobilizing every resource that we have and we are continuing to mobilize additional sources to reunite Krista with her family,"" Perley said.","Krista Dittmeyer, 20, has not been seen since Saturday .

"Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates (CNN) -- An Emirati blogger who has called for reform in the United Arab Emirates is being held in Al Wathba prison in Abu Dhabi, his wife said Wednesday . Ahmed Mansoor is being treated well, according to wife Nadia, who said she spoke to him Tuesday evening. Mansoor's attorney, Abdul Hamid Al Kumity, said he is not aware of any charges against his client, but will meet with the prosecutor's office Wednesday. Dubai police have told Al Kumity that two bottles of whiskey were found in Mansoor's house. Alcohol is available at hotels and select stores in the UAE, but Muslims are not allowed to buy or possess it. Mansoor's wife acknowledged that here was alcohol in their house, but said they don't drink. The alcohol, in a small unopened box, was probably a gift from friends or family, she said. About 10 men, including two wearing police uniforms, picked up Mansoor from his apartment Friday afternoon, according to his wife. The men also took Mansoor's passport and laptop and left without telling her where they were taking him or why. Fahad Salem al-Shehhi, a friend of Mansoor's who helped him with his website, was detained Saturday evening, said activist Mohammed al-Mansoori. Al-Shehhi was taken from the Emirate of Ajman, where he was living temporarily while his wife studies there, al-Mansoori said. Al-Shehhi has been without a passport for seven years, he said. The third, Nasser bin Ghaith, an Emirati writer who also maintains a website, was detained Sunday, al-Mansoori said. Officials in the UAE have not responded to persistent queries regarding the detentions. Mansoor has no criminal record or prior incidences with the law, according to Al Kumity. Mansoor was part of a group of 133 nationals who petitioned the president on March 9 for direct elections. The group included academics, former government officials, journalists and activists. The petition was addressed to President Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan and the members of the Supreme Council of the seven Emirates that form the UAE. In addition to elections, the group asked that the Federal National Council be granted legislative powers. The body only works in an advisory capacity and has no regulatory powers.","Attorney for blogger is not aware of any charges against him .

"(Fast Company)  -- The iPad is changing how folks read stuff online -- no surprise if you think how different a gizmo it is to a PC. But a new study shows it's moving online reading into primetime TV hours, which is big news. Is evening reading coming back, just in a digital style? The study comes from internal data acquired by ReadItLater, a web service that lets users bookmark web content for perusal at a different time. Though you may think this slightly colors the dataset, the way this service works gives the company unique access to time-coded data on how iPad users (and traditional computer users) read content online. By looking at how traffic moves through their servers, normalized for global time differences, the ReadItLater team worked out how traditional PC users spread their online reading out during the day. As you may expect, given how deeply into our everyday lives the computer has penetrated, the curve of content consumption is pretty stable -- not much happens in the wee small hours of the day, then as people wake and go to work there's more traffic, with a small peak spread out around traditional lunch hours and another around 8 p.m. after the evening meal. When you look at iPhone and iPad user traffic, distinct from ""normal"" PCs, everything is suddenly very different. iPhone users have distinct peaks in their reading habits, timed to correspond with the morning routine of breakfast, then a commute to work, the end of the work day and homeward journey, and then last thing in the evening. This matches the iPhone's status as a handy, portable, always-on Net browser that's good for quick content consumption. But it's with the iPad that the statistics get very odd indeed: With minor usage spikes first thing in the morning, at lunchtime and then dinner time, the main bulk of iPad text content consumption is from 7 p.m. to 11 p.m.. Fast Company: iPad 2 rumor round-up . This is prime-time TV's slot, and it seems that as well as settling back on the sofa to watch TV, people are taking their iPad with them too. The data doesn't reveal if folk are multitasking (spending some time ogling their favorite shows, some looking data up on the Web) or are ignoring the TV altogether--but the data will still be of concern to TV execs who expect uninterrupted attention from TV watchers, in order to maximize ad revenues. Plus it's something of a return to a traditional leisure hour image: People settling down on the couch after the evening meal to read the paper or a book, possibly to listen to the radio at the same time. Remembering a study last year that showed how much time users devote to reading magazines on an iPad, we have to wonder is the iPad causing a renaissance in reading -- just digitally, and with Web content as well as digital books content? Fast Company: More technology coverage . If this is true, then Rupert Murdoch's Daily iPad newspaper is arriving with pinpoint timing. And the hordes of Android tablets that have just arrived should accentuate the effect. This is thus something that PR and advertising executives need to pay careful attention to, because the attention focus of the average consumer may be switching away from the TV to their other (newer) powerful glowing screen--in their laps.

"(RealSimple.com) -- The shocking discovery of an affair nearly devastated their marriage, but a series of couples support seminars helped repair and strengthen their bond. Angie and Greg Cooper Duluth, Georgia Married 20 years . One afternoon in the fall of 2002, Greg sat down at the family's computer with the intention of researching their upcoming trip to Walt Disney World. He never got that far. Once he woke up the monitor, he made a bewildering discovery: The screen displayed the in-box of an unfamiliar e-mail account registered to his wife, Angie, 43. Perplexed, he called her into the room. Angie realized she had forgotten to close her old account and knew it was time to come clean. ""It's over,"" she said. ""But please don't read the e-mails."" Angie then made a startling confession: For nearly a year, she had had an affair. It had ended only seven months earlier. ""I was sick to my stomach,"" says Greg, 46. ""I thought, I'll never get over this. We're getting a divorce."" Angie, an insurance account manager, and Greg had been growing apart for years. Before the birth of their sons, Nicholas, 17, and Aidan, 10, the couple had liked to curl up on the couch to watch Marx Brothers classics and while away hours perusing local flea markets for antiques. That had changed: Angie was spending her time either at work or at home with young Aidan, while Greg, a photographer, busily coached Nicholas's soccer team and led his Cub Scout pack. ""I didn't feel important to Greg beyond being our children's caregiver,"" says Angie.""I just felt lonely and trapped."" She was flattered when, in the spring of 2001, the married father of one of her son's friends began flirting with her. When he took her aside at a neighborhood gathering and proposed they meet privately, Angie agreed. ""I never wanted an actual relationship with him. I was drawn to the craziness of it, seeing what we could get away with,"" she says. Eventually the affair fizzled out. But for reasons she can't explain, Angie never deleted the e-mails or the account she had used to correspond with her lover. RealSimple.com: 10 ways to make your marriage divorceproof . After Greg learned about the affair, he furiously warned the man, whom he knew casually, never to come near Angie or their sons again. (The man and his family moved away a few weeks later.) Angie said she hoped to reunite with Greg, but he told her he was dead set on divorcing. That's what he said, anyway; emotionally he was ambivalent. ""I stayed awake for two nights, thinking, I still love her. I can't end it,"" says Greg. Ultimately he told her he wanted to stay together -- but acknowledged he had no idea how to reconcile. For months they slept in the same bed but rarely spoke to each other except in their therapist's office. Aidan was too young to notice the change in his parents' behavior, but Nicholas, aware of their unhappiness (though not the cause of it), became quiet and withdrawn. Greg began suffering from anxiety and insomnia. His moods swung from anger to grief. ""It was terrible to watch him trying to cope,"" says Angie. ""I knew it was because of my actions."" Close friends even suggested the couple consider divorce, but Angie wasn't ready to call it quits. In July 2003, she searched online for marriage support groups and found Retrouvaille, a Catholic seminar that promises to help couples communicate better. She signed them up for the next three-day session. At first Greg wasn't thrilled. ""I envisioned a group where everyone just aired their grievances,"" he says. ""How could that help?"" But he agreed to try it. There they met some couples who had gone through the program after experiencing infidelity and had come back as mentors. ""We were encouraged to see others who had survived the same thing,"" says Angie. Over the next year, the couple attended more seminars, including one in October 2004 where they discussed the reason behind Angie's affair for the first time. It was revelatory, says Greg: ""I had no idea Angie had the affair because she felt lonely. I thought she had done it because she didn't love me."" Now they mentor other couples at Retrouvaille, an experience Greg has found so rewarding that he's returned to graduate school to become a marriage and family therapist. He and Angie check in with each other constantly about how the other is doing. When Greg began worrying recently that his course load would force them to spend a lot of time apart, he spoke up. And she reassured him: ""I reminded Greg that it's all the things we've been through together that have led to this new career. I told him I love him and believe in him, and we will be fine. Neither of us is going anywhere."" Get a FREE TRIAL issue of Real Simple - CLICK HERE! Copyright © 2010 Time Inc.

"Washington (CNN) -- The U.S. is preparing new sanctions against members of the Syrian regime of Bashar al-Assad who are overseeing the violent crackdown against protesters, according to several senior U.S. officials with knowledge of the action. A new Treasury Department executive order targeting senior officials accused of human rights abuses would involve an asset freeze and travel ban, as well as prohibiting them them from doing business in the United States. On Monday, National Security Council spokesman Tommy Vietor said the United States is ""pursuing a range of possible policy options, including targeted sanctions, to respond to the crackdown and make clear that this behavior is unacceptable."" The move comes as the Obama administration weighs its options on how to step up pressure against the al-Assad regime. Sanctions are among ""a range of possible options"" to pressure the Syrian government to stop attacking protesters, White House spokesman Jay Carney said Monday. ""What we have seen is that sanctions can put pressure on governments and regimes to change their behavior,"" Carney said. A meeting of the Deputies Committee at the White House on Friday explored what additional unilateral sanctions the United States could impose against Syria and other actions the U.S. could take, including a possible on-camera statement by President Obama. There have been numerous reports of deadly violence over the past several days. On Sunday, at least three protesters were killed when security forces and secret police raided the town of Jableh on Syria's western coast and fired at demonstrators without warning, according to a witness and demonstrator. Security forces surrounded a mosque that was being used to treat the wounded, preventing 18 seriously wounded people from being hospitalized, according to a doctor inside. On Saturday, at least 10 people died after Syrian security forces opened fire on mourners at funeral processions in Douma and the southern town of Izraa, according to witness accounts. Amnesty International reported at least 75 deaths across the country Friday. The decision to step up pressure comes amid increased fears of further bloodshed. ""We are worried he is dropping all pretenses of reform and carrots and sticks and is going to go out hard with all sticks,"" one official said. ""We are expecting him to increase the crackdown."" On Friday, the White House released a statement by Obama condemning ""in the strongest possible terms the use of force by the Syrian government against demonstrators."" ""This outrageous use of violence to quell protests must come to an end now,"" Obama said. The State Department is expected to call in the Syrian ambassador to the U.S. to protest the violence, and Robert Ford, the U.S. ambassador to Syria, was protesting the crackdown to foreign ministry officials in Damascus, officials said. The administration had taken a somewhat muted response to the crackdown in Syria out of fear of destabilizing the al-Assad regime. Officials have voiced concern about possible sectarian tensions if al-Assad's Allowite minority were to be overthrown and have expressed little confidence about Syria's fragmented opposition, leaving uncertainty about what type of government would replace al-Assad. The U.S. has also been under pressure from Israel and allies in the Gulf like Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, who fear that al-Assad's departure could produce a more radical Syria and encourage further revolutions, officials said. However, as  the crackdown in Syria has intensified, several U.S. officials and Western diplomats have described the regime as increasingly brittle and predicted that it would be hard for Assad to survive. Officials acknowledge that the United States has little leverage on Syria, which has proved immune to U.S. pressure during the protests. The Bush administration imposed strict sanctions against Damascus in 2004, including banning almost all imports and exports between the two countries and measures against individual officials believed to be supporting extremists fighting U.S. forces in Iraq. It is unclear how effective a new round of sanctions would be. ""It isn't the same with Egypt, where we had relationships with the military and other institutions,"" one official said. ""We had aid we could use as a lever. There isn't a lot we can do with Syria. We are pretty maxed out with sanctions."" Officials said the U.S. would be urging its European allies, who have also become increasingly concerned about the violence in Syria, to follow suit with measures of their own that could be more effective, given that Syrian officials have more assets in Europe and travel there more frequently. But the sanctions would mark a shift in U.S. policy toward al-Assad, whom the Obama administration had hoped would be a reformer and had tried to engage. Since Obama took office, the U.S. has eased some of the sanctions imposed by the Bush administration, and this year Obama returned a U.S. ambassador to Syria after nearly six years. The U.S. is also lobbying the United Nations to address Syria's human rights abuses. On Tuesday, the United Nations Security Council is expected to take up the issue, and Washington is seeking to block Syria's efforts to join the U.N. Human Rights Council in Geneva, where members are meeting Friday. U.S. Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, R-Florida, chairwoman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, has said she will soon introduce legislation updating the Syria Accountability and Liberation Act to strengthen U.S. sanctions, including authorizing U.S. assistance to support a transition to democracy in Syria.","Senior officials might be hit with asset freeze, travel ban .

"Washington (CNN) -- Football player Albert Haynesworth has been charged with misdemeanor sexual abuse involving a waitress at a Washington hotel bar. A defensive tackle for the Washington Redskins, Haynesworth, 29, allegedly stuck a credit card down the front of a server's dress and fondled her breast, according to prosecutors. Court papers do not identify the waitress but say the incident happened around 2 a.m. on February 13 at a rooftop lounge atop the W Hotel. An indictment was returned Tuesday by a grand jury in Superior Court of the District of Columbia. An arraignment has been scheduled for May 10. According to a news release, Haynesworth could face up to 180 days in jail and a maximum fine of $1,000 if convicted. Haynesworth's defense attorney, A. Scott Bolden, called the indictment ""disappointing, regretful and a difficult case for the government to prove."" ""The indictment is merely a charge, not a conviction,"" Bolden said. ""And in fact, my client maintains his innocence because he is innocent. We will vigorously continue to fight these charges, and I fully expect him to be exonerated from any wrongdoing.""

"Boston (CNN) -- More than 2,000 women in Boston are homeless, but CNN Hero Roseanna Means is giving them something they can count on -- free, quality medical care. Means is the founder of Women of Means, a nonprofit organization that sends volunteer doctors and nurses into homeless shelters in and around Boston. She recently spoke with CNN's Danielle Berger about the impact of her team's efforts. Below are excerpts from that interview. Danielle Berger: Your program focuses on women. Why women, not men? Roseanna Means: There are so many things that women have to deal with more so than men do -- reproductive years, and then mammograms, then menopause. A lot of women's health is preventive care, and if women lose out on those screening tests, their lives are in danger. In the world of homelessness, there are lots of emotional issues, psychiatric issues, women who have been beaten up so many times they can't connect the dots. They don't have an address. They don't have a phone. They're all sitting in a shelter together, but they're not necessarily friends. There's not a common bond of, ""We're all in this together."" Everybody is struggling. Everybody's isolated. Everybody's miserable. Berger: How does that affect how they access medical care? Means: Their default position is, ""I'm just going to wait until it's a crisis [and] I have to go to the emergency room."" And so, what we're able to do by intervening -- in kind of a casual, compassionate, friendly and welcoming way -- is create a relationship so that when it comes time, I can say: ""You know, I think you need to go to the hospital. And one of our people will go there and make sure you get there safely."" And we'll write a note to make sure that the doctor on the other end knows what's going on. Then they're not costing so much to the system. And everybody benefits. The cost of medical care now is going sky-high because people use emergency rooms inappropriately, or because they're waiting too long to deal with something that could've been dealt with through preventive care and better management. Berger: How does Women of Means grow beyond Roseanna Means? Means: We now have physicians who, five or six years ago, came through as students to learn about our program. And now, they've graduated. They've become doctors. And they remember what it was like to work in these shelters with us. And when we are looking to place a woman with a primary care doctor who understands what these women are living with, we can call up one of these former students and say: ""Remember when you did your rotation at Rosie's Place (a Boston Shelter)? Well, we've got a woman here who really needs to have someone who knows her issues. And we'd like you to take her on."" And they will. It's great.

"New York (CNN) -- Two teeth that appear to be human were discovered by investigators Friday in a thicketed and remote oceanfront stretch of Long Island, according to police. The teeth were found near where a human skull was uncovered in Nassau County last week, and are the latest discovery in an ongoing search that has found 10 sets of human remains since December. From those remains, authorities have identified at least eight bodies. Nassau County Executive Edward Mangano said Friday's find takes authorities a step closer to bringing ""this killer to justice,"" though he added that a medical examiner will have to determine if the teeth are indeed human. Earlier Friday, police spokesman Kevin Smith cautioned against media speculation regarding a possible killer, saying that the two sets of human remains found in Nassau County have yet to be classified as a criminal homicide matter. ""Anybody who is making a profile (of a possible killer), its pure speculation,"" Smith said in reference to the human remains found in that county. His words were in sharp contrast with those of authorities in neighboring Suffolk County, where eight other sets of human remains have been found. That county's police commissioner, Richard Dormer, said the remains found in Suffolk could be the work of a serial killer or killers. Dormer first mentioned the possibility of a serial killer in January, when the total number of bodies found was four. Those bodies were all women prostitutes uncovered within a quarter-mile of each other, according to Dormer. ""Common sense tells us it's not a coincidence,"" Suffolk County Detective Lt. Gerard Pelkofsky said at the time. Since then, authorities have discovered six additional sets of human remains in the two counties. They appeared to be in various stages of decomposition, police said. Officials have yet to identify the latest sets and have provided few other details regarding the discoveries. Friday's find of the teeth came as police fanned out across brush and bramble-filled areas that border a Long Island highway in a remote area near the Town of Oyster Bay. Earlier this week, police divers scoured the sea floor with metal detectors and long poles during an underwater search for evidence in the possible serial killer case. ""It could be a piece of jewelry, it could be a piece of apparel, anything of interest,"" said Harold Jantzen, the Suffolk County marine deputy inspector. That search was in the same area where the first four bodies were uncovered in December. The area, near private docks in upscale Oak Beach, is also where 23-year-old Shannan Gilbert was last seen in May of last year. The missing New Jersey woman's disappearance prompted the initial search. She was reported missing after attending a private party at a home in the Oak Beach community. No sign of her has been found. Police said Gilbert, like the other four women found in Suffolk County, had advertised prostitution services on Internet sites such as Craigslist.","NEW: Two teeth that appear to be human are discovered by investigators .

THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED. CARL AZUZ, CNN STUDENT NEWS ANCHOR: Military action is underway in the skies over Libya, and the U.S. is one of several countries involved. It's our first story in the week's first edition of CNN Student News. First Up: Libya Civil War . AZUZ: It's called ""Operation Odyssey Dawn,"" and the goal is to enforce a no-fly zone over Libya. The United Nations Security Council voted for that no-fly zone late last week. The coalition responsible for enforcing it is made up of forces from the U.S., Great Britain and France, among others. After the Security Council's vote, Libya's government declared a cease-fire in its fighting with rebel forces. And it invited representatives from other nations to come to Libya to make sure the cease-fire was real. Coalition forces were convinced that Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi was not following the rules of the cease-fire. On Saturday, the coalition attacked. You can hear the sounds of gunfire in the capital city of Tripoli. A U.S. commander said missiles landed near the capital and around other cities as part of these attacks. The fighting between Colonel Gadhafi's forces and rebels raged on in other cities, like Benghazi. Here, you can see a fighter jet that was shot down over Benghazi on Saturday. Admiral Michael Mullen, the chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, said on Sunday that coalition forces had taken out most of Libya's air defense systems. But Admiral Mullen also said the U.S. role in ""Operation Odyssey Dawn"" would be limited, saying ""we're not going to put any boots on the ground."" Colonel Gadhafi? He's harshly criticized the other countries getting involved with the civil war in Libya. He called the coalition forces ""terrorists"" and promised a ""long-drawn war."" But Sunday, a spokesman for the Libyan military called for another cease-fire. Soundcheck . U.S. PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: Today, we are both also delivering assistance and support to the Japanese people at their greatest hour of need. The ties that bind our nations to Japan are strong. In the United States, we forged an alliance of more than sixty years. The people of Japan are some of our closest friends, and we will pray with them, and stand with them, and rebuild with them until this crisis has passed. Disaster in Japan . AZUZ: We're starting to see some new effects of the nuclear crisis in Japan that resulted from a tsunami triggered by a 9.0-magnitude earthquake. Yesterday, the government health ministry banned the sale of spinach from the area near the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. Officials made that decision based on radiation levels that were over the government limit. There were already bans on the sale of raw milk and restrictions on produce from the area surrounding the nuclear plant. Workers inside that power plant were starting to see some signs of progress over the weekend in their efforts to cool down these nuclear reactors. But officials say ""even in the best scenario, there will be a lot of bumps ahead."" One they came across Sunday was the possibility that they might need to release radioactive gas into the air. They would do that in order to release some of the pressure that's building up inside one of the reactors. The tsunami knocked out the plant's cooling systems, and getting those back online is crucial. Allan Chernoff has a household comparison that helps explain why. ALLAN CHERNOFF, CNN SENIOR CORRESPONDENT, NEW YORK: To get a sense of the challenge confronting the Japanese at the Daiichi nuclear plant, consider this situation in a kitchen: a pot with no water on top of a high flame. Obviously, this dangerous situation could cause a fire in here. Well, stay with me. Those spent nuclear rods can generate tremendous heat, up to 2,100 degrees. Enough to melt them, burn them and send radioactive material into the atmosphere. They have to be kept under water, just like spaghetti when we're cooking. Now, those rods are normally kept under 30 feet of water, but according to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, in at least one of the pools in Japan, the rods are exposed; there's virtually no water or no water at all. So, how do we resolve this situation? Well, if we don't take the pot off the flame, we add water. And that is exactly what the Japanese are trying to do right now; any way they can, even dumping it from helicopters. They are trying desperately to get water into that pool to avoid a nuclear disaster. Allan Chernoff, CNN, New York. AZUZ: There was some good news on Sunday when rescue workers found an 80-year-old woman and her 16-year-old grandson. They'd been trapped in their home for nine days. The news gave hope to other people whose loved ones are still missing. But as Gary Tuchman explains, the search efforts are not easy. (BEGIN VIDEO) GARY TUCHMAN, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Kesennuma, Japan. The scene behind me here is one of chaos, confusion; it is surreal. If you see the video we took, you won't believe it. At least, we didn't when we saw it in person. So much debris, so much rubble. It's impenetrable. It is like a canyon. When we went down there, it's like climbing a mountain. Cars, boats, houses: pushed out of different neighborhoods, pushed out of different areas and blocking fire officials, military officials. They're looking for survivors, the possibility of survivors, or trying to find bodies. We met a woman today who told us her father was at the second floor of his house, made the decision to stay in the second floor when the tsunami siren sounded. Well, anyway, at this point, they can't get to the house. It appears the house is still there, but there's so much rubble surrounding the house, there's no way to check if this man survived. It's just an absolutely incredible scene. It's hard to imagine what the people here in northeastern Japan are going through. The death toll is rising rapidly. We know it will continue to rise. We ourselves, just myself and my crew, found a body in the back of a car. This is how they're finding bodies, the officials. There's so much rubble down there they can't get to. It's very likely that it will be weeks or months before they come anywhere close to knowing what this death toll is. And the aftershocks continue. Last night, while we were sleeping, we felt at least six or seven sizable aftershocks, and that only increases the anxiety that people feel here in northeastern Japan. This is Gary Tuchman, CNN, in Japan. (END VIDEO) Impact Your World . AZUZ: A lot of you have been asking on our Facebook page about how you can help the victims of this crisis.

None of the candidates got enough votes for an outright victory. Yesterday, Haitians headed to the polls to vote in a runoff election. One candidate is a former law professor and first lady. The other is a Haitian entertainer. There were some problems early on at a couple polling locations: missing ballot boxes, and not enough ink to mark who had voted. But officials said those issues were resolved by later in the morning. The final results of the runoff are scheduled to be released in mid-April. Shoutout .

"Bangkok, Thailand (CNN) -- Clashes over a disputed area along the Thai-Cambodian border erupted for a fourth consecutive day Monday, resulting in the death of a Thai soldier, a military official said. Four other Thai soldiers have been killed since the fighting started Friday, according to Col. Sansern Kaewkumnerd. Authorities have evacuated thousands of people from nearby villages. Each side blames the other for the violence, which first broke out last week near two temples in the Phanom Dong Rak district of Thailand's Surin province. Cambodia's government has said three of its troops have been killed. On Monday, Sansern accused Cambodians of trying to seize two ancient temples, Ta Kwai and Ta Muen Thom. The fighting on the ground has been coupled with a war of words in recent days. On Sunday, Sansern accused Cambodian troops of opening fire first and said Thai troops responded to protect their country's sovereignty. Cambodian officials could not be immediately reached for comment. A statement from the country's defense ministry Saturday described the clashes as an ""assault by Thai infantry units,"" accusing Thailand of flying spy planes into Cambodia and attacking with heavy weapons. Thailand's foreign ministry issued statements Saturday accusing Cambodia of ""firing heavy weapons at innocent Thai civilians."" U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said Monday that the United States ""remains deeply concerned about clashes between security forces along the Thailand-Cambodia border."" The U.S. government is speaking directly to Thai and Cambodian officials, and also supports efforts by Indonesia, the chair of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, to work with both countries on a resolution, Clinton's statement said. In February, at least 10 people were killed when fighting flared up in another disputed border area between the two nations, prompting the United Nations Security Council to issue a statement calling on both sides to implement a cease-fire. Those clashes, which lasted four days, stemmed from a longstanding conflict related to the 11th-century Preah Vihear temple. Both Cambodia and Thailand lay claim to the temple, which sits atop a cliff on Cambodian soil but has its most accessible entrance on the Thai side. At the time, each nation accused the other of firing first. CNN's Kocha Olarn contributed to this report.","NEW: Clinton says the United States is ""deeply concerned""

"(CNN) -- A 16-year-old boy has been arrested in the murder of two British men, found shot dead at 3 a.m. Saturday in Sarasota, Florida, police say. Sarasota Police have identified the victims as James M. Cooper, 25, and James Thomas Kouzaris, 24, both from England. The juvenile, who police said was arrested previously this month on a charge of aggravated assault with a handgun, was arrested 24 hours after the murders at 3 a.m. Sunday. Where he was arrested was not disclosed. Police were alerted to the incident by a 911 caller who said ""a person was lying on the ground covered in blood"" at the scene, on a one-way residential street with no businesses. Sarasota Police Chief Mikel Hollaway said officials are trying to determine why the men were there. ""We have our suspicions, but at this time it would be unfair to state those,"" he said. ""I believe they were there of their own volition."" The neighborhood where the British men were found is a housing project in north Sarasota called Newtown, Hollaway said. The teen suspect in the case lives near the crime scene, police said. Although the housing authority has worked to improve the complex, ""it has its problems,"" Hollaway said. ""This is an isolated incident."" The murders were the first homicides of the year, he said. The two men were believed to be friends who recently graduated from college and were in Sarasota to celebrate, police said. ""On behalf of the city of Sarasota, we want to express our condolences for the families of the two victims who were obviously on holiday from the United Kingdom,"" Sarasota Mayor Kelly Kirschner said.","NEW: Police are trying to determine why the men were at a housing project .

"(CNN) -- At least 98 people have been killed by the earthquake in New Zealand and the death toll could rise, Prime Minister John Key said Thursday, as hundreds remain missing -- among them, nearly 30 Japanese students. As more bodies are recovered and as the identification process continues, authorities acknowledge that the number of fatalities will rise. Some 431 people have been admitted to hospital emergency rooms since the quake, according to Iona Wassilieff with New Zealand's National Crisis Management Center. Authorities say another 1,000 people have been treated for minor injuries. Currently, 27 Japanese students are among those missing, according to Japan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Most of that group is from Toyama Foreign Language College; two are students from another language school in Tokyo and five are on personal study trips from other parts of Japan. Japan's Asahi Shimbun newspaper interviewed two victims from Toyama Foreign Language College who were pulled from the rubble in New Zealand. Kento Okuda and Norika Masutani are both 19-years-old and students at the language school, and now both are patients at Christchurch Hospital. Okuda said he was in the cafeteria having lunch on the fourth floor when he felt the first, big shake, according to the paper. The floor gave way and he felt himself falling, but said he had no no idea how far he fell. The entire building was dark, he said, and he realized he couldn't move his right leg because it was trapped under heavy rubble. Masutani was also on the fourth floor when the quake hit, Asahi Shimbun said. She said she panicked when the floor gave way. Both Masutani and Okuda told the paper that, after the quake, all the students caught in rubble tried to talk to each other and do a count of who was able to talk and who couldn't. Many of their fellow Japanese students did not respond. Masutani told the paper that aftershocks progressively brought more rubble down around her, shrinking the void she was in. She smelled smoke and gas, she said, adding, ""I was scared that a fire was coming."" But a rescue team located Masutani and pulled her out, according to Asahi Shimbun. She has bruises and sprains, but no major injuries. Okuda told the paper he heard the rescue team approaching him. He lost his leg but said but that he had no details on when it was cut off or when he was pulled from the rubble. ""The reason why I survived in the dark for hours is that we could talk to each other. Please help my classmates,"" Masutani told the paper, referring to the missing students believed trapped under the rubble. Officials have given up hope of rescuing at least 100 people who were trapped in the Canterbury TV building in downtown Christchurch. Police said they were ""100% certain"" no one still trapped in the building was still alive. Officials fear that people who remain trapped inside the Pyne Gould corporation building are dead , according to CNN's Anna Coren. House-to-house searches are the priority Thursday for rescue workers in Christchurch, authorities explained at a news conference early Thursday morning. Christchurch has been divided into a grid pattern, Collins and other officials said. Urban search-and-rescue teams with paramedic and building-assessment training have fanned out across key neighborhoods searching for earthquake victims. Meanwhile, New Zealand's Red Cross says roughly 900 people took shelter in welfare centers overnight Wednesday. Also Wednesday, confusion over the status of an Australian woman who was trapped in rubble was resolved. Anne Vos, who spoke to the outside world by mobile phone while trapped beneath rubble, is recuperating in a hospital in New Zealand, according to Dana Robertson with the Australian High Commission in Canberra. Vos made calls to the media and her family in Australia Tuesday before she was rescued from the rubble of the Pyne Gould Corporation Building in the central business district, according to Australian and New Zealand media. ""A couple of hours ago, I thought I'd had it,"" she told New Zealand network TV3 Tuesday. ""I thought it was 'Goodbye Anne.' "" ""I've managed to wiggle out a bit because I couldn't breathe. Now I've got a wee bit of air here. I rang my kids to say goodbye. ""My daughter was crying and I was crying because I thought 'This is it.' You've got to tell them you love them. ... I'm not going to give up ..."" she said. Earlier, news outlets reported she had been rescued, but others said later that rescuers had confused her with someone else. Another woman named ""Ann"" was pulled from the same ruined building on the same day. Ann Bodkin took cover under her desk in the same building when the quake struck. She was trapped in her office building for 24 hours. ""The sun came out the moment she was removed from the building,"" said Christchurch Mayor Bob Parker. ""It was like God turned on the lights."" Rescue workers applauded as Bodkin was pulled alive from the rubble. She was one of about 30 people rescued Wednesday from the Pyne Gould building and the Canterbury Television building, the two blocks most severely damaged in the quake. The quake toppled buildings onto buses, buckled streets and ripped the facades of iconic churches, including the Christchurch Cathedral and the Cathedral of the Blessed Sacrament. It also cut power for most of the city, leaving rescuers working overnight under floodlights. ""This is just heartbreaking,"" Prime Minister John Key said. ""This may be New Zealand's darkest day."" As the rescuers scrambled to reach survivors, the Web turned into a crisis center as Google offered a service for people searching for loved ones. Google's crisis response service provided a place to find information, including telephone numbers and incident reports. The initial quake, which struck early Tuesday afternoon, was followed by a series of aftershocks, the New Zealand Ministry of Defense said. A U.S. emergency official was in Christchurch as part of a delegation working with the New Zealand government on disaster response. ""I was at the airport when the earthquake struck,"" said Tim Manning, deputy administrator for the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency. Manning said he was working with the U.S. Embassy to find citizens who need assistance and providing help to New Zealand officials. Southern New Zealand has been hit by a series of quakes since September 4 when a 7.1-magnitude temblor struck the area. The earthquake hit in the predawn hours, with the deserted streets helping to keep injuries to a minimum. There were no deaths from that quake. The September quake struck deeper below ground and farther away from Christchurch than Tuesday's temblor, causing less damage despite the higher magnitude, officials said. The U.S. Geological Survey said Tuesday's earthquake was part of the ""aftershock sequence"" from the September earthquake. ""It's a nightmare. A lot of people were just getting back on their feet after the original quake,"" said Kevin Fenaughty, data center manager for GNS Science, an earth-science research institute.

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- Afghan authorities said Tuesday they have recaptured 65 of the more than 400 inmates who slipped out of a southern Afghanistan prison a day earlier through a nearly quarter-mile tunnel dug beneath the compound. A massive search operation continues to find the others -- many of them insurgent fighters, said the Kandahar governor's office. The Taliban issued a statement taking responsibility for the escape from the prison in Kandahar, the Taliban's birthplace. Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahed said digging the tunnel took five months. The escape took four and a half hours, he said. The Taliban claimed 541 prisoners escaped. The NATO-led International Security Assistance Force said the number of escaped prisoners was closer to 470. The Taliban said 106 of the escapees were military commanders, but there was no immediate government confirmation of the claim. Monday's break was the second escape at the prison in three years. In 2008, as many as 1,000 prisoners -- nearly half of them Taliban members -- escaped after militants detonated a truck bomb against the side of the prison compound. The prison houses some of the country's most dangerous Taliban prisoners, and the escape was an embarrassment for the Afghanistan government and its Western allies, said CNN National Security Analyst Peter Bergen. ""It's, I think, quite a black eye for the U.S. and NATO and the Afghan government, who have put quite a lot of resources into trying to improve the prison systems, and here you have this massive prison break, with sadly, some pretty hardcore Taliban prisoners who escaped,"" he said. Waheed Omer, a spokesman for Afghan President Hamid Karzai, called the mass escape ""bad news and a disaster."" Although the Taliban said some of the escapees were military commanders, it's unlikely the escape will have a significant impact on military operations in Afghanistan, said Thomas E. Gouttierre, director of the Center of Afghanistan Studies at the University of Nebraska in Omaha. ""I don't think I would see this as a big blow to Western efforts in Afghanistan,"" he said. Instead, he said Afghanistan's government is likely to bear the brunt of criticism for failing to anticipate or prevent the escape, especially after previous escapes at this and other prisons. In the 2008 escape, militants used a truck loaded with about two tons of explosives and driven by suicide drivers to blast holes in the mud brick walls of the prison. A gun and rocket battle followed, lasting several hours and ending with militants rushing into the prison on motorcycles to free prisoners, according to Taliban accounts of the attack. Nine guards, seven prisoners and one civilian were killed in the attack, according to the provincial government. Security forces said they tried to track down the escaped prisoners, but said the large Taliban presence in the region and the numerous hideouts located there made it difficult to hunt down militants. Kandahar has been the site of fierce fighting between international forces and insurgents. It has been the site of numerous anti-Western demonstrations, recently over the burning of the Quran, Islam's holy book, by a pastor in the United States. On April 15, the police chief of Kandahar province was killed when a man wearing a military uniform detonated a bomb at the entrance to the police headquarters. In February, 10 people died when mines exploded at a playground during a picnic hosted by a former police commander. In a separate incident, 19 people, including 15 police officers, died when armed attackers targeted police headquarters. After attacks on the country's ministry of defense, the assassination of the police chief and now Monday's prison break, Kandahar resident Kari Ghar said it's ""impossible to call this system a government."" ""This is the worst possible weakness of the Afghan government that almost every single political prisoners escape from the central jail in Kandahar,"" Ghar said.

"Borno, Nigeria (CNN) -- Nigeria will proceed with national gubernatorial elections Tuesday, despite continuing violence that has raised fears that an Islamist group will step up attacks against voters. Bomb blasts Monday in Nigeria's northeastern state of Borno killed three people and wounded dozens, police said. In one of three blasts, a bomb thrown from a motorcycle on which two young men were riding detonated, resulting in the three fatalities, said Michael Zukoma, police commissioner for Borno state. Nigerian police told CNN that Boko Haram, an Islamist sect that has challenged Nigeria's government, is responsible for the attacks, which they described as an attempt to intimidate voters who this month re-elected President Goodluck Jonathan, an Ijaw Christian from the south. The explosions occurred a day after the Nigerian Red Cross reported that rural villages had held mass burials in northern Nigeria. Witnesses say that violence in the wake of Jonathan's election has resulted in hundreds of deaths, though there is no official death toll. The government has provided few details. This month's election of Jonathan, who is from the majority-Christian southern part of the country, sparked violence in the Muslim-dominated north last week. Concerns about ongoing violence led Nigerian election officials last week to delay the planned gubernatorial elections in two of Nigeria's 36 states. Voters in Kaduna and Bauchi states will go to the polls Thursday. Northern Muslims in some areas charged that the presidential election was rigged. Armed protesters in the region took to the streets chanting the name of former military ruler Muhammadu Buhari, the main opposition front-runner. The last election, four years ago, was widely condemned for rampant vote rigging, violence, theft of ballot boxes and intimidation. While this month's presidential election was marred by violence, reports of underage voting and logistical problems, observers said they considered it an improvement. After he was declared the victor, Jonathan warned that persistent post-election violence could threaten the stability of the country. ""These acts of mayhem are sad reminders of the events which plunged our country into 30 months of an unfortunate civil war,"" Jonathan said last week. Jonathan was referring to a period of unrest in the 1960s that spawned a civil war in Nigeria. Nigeria is Africa's largest oil producer and its most populous nation, with 150 million people.","A bomb blast on Monday kills 3 people .

"(CNN) -- Coach Jose Mourinho has told his Real Madrid players to heed the wisdom of Albert Einstein ahead of Wednesday's Champions League semifinal first leg against Spanish arch-rivals Barcelona. Having been crushed 5-0 by Barca in this season's first ""Clasico"" clash in the Catalan capital in November, Mourinho has successfully resorted to more defensive tactics to earn a draw at the Santiago Bernabeu and then victory in the Spanish Cup final last Wednesday. Real's strategies in those matches bore more resemblance to the Portuguese coach's winning formula against Barca while in charge of Inter Milan in last season's Champions League semis than the all-out attacking blitz that saw Madrid crush Valencia 6-3 on Saturday. ""Each competition is independent of the other and each match has its own story,"" Mourinho told reporters on Tuesday. ""It's the Champions League. We have to give our best without being influenced by what happened before. The billion-dollar grudge match . ""I don't have a magic potion to beat Barcelona. I work very hard and very seriously, and I spend many hours trying to help the people around, but a few months ago we lost 5-0 and I was the manager then."" Mourinho, seeking to become the first coach to win the European title with three different clubs, hinted that he will again try to stifle Barca's attacking potency as he quoted the world's most famous physicist. ""I told my players there was someone called Albert, Albert Einstein, who said that there is a force more powerful than steam, electricity and atomic energy: will. And this guy Albert was not stupid,"" the 48-year-old said. ""For me there are no favorites. It's the Champions League semifinals -- two rival teams who know each other very well. Two teams with long traditions, whose players know what it is to be successful, who know how to win things and play big matches."" Is Mourinho the master of mind games? Captain Carles Puyol has returned to Barcelona's squad to boost coach Pep Guardiola's defensive options, but key midfielder Andres Iniesta has been ruled out with a calf injury. Puyol missed Saturday's 2-0 win over Osasuna and the Copa del Rey final defeat by Real, having gone off with a thigh injury during the previous weekend's El Clasico clash in Madrid. Iniesta, who scored Spain's winner in the 2010 World Cup final, is expected to be back for the following week's second leg, Guardiola told reporters on Tuesday. Argentina center-back Gabriel Milito was named in the squad despite going off against Osasuna, but fellow defenders Maxwell, Adriano and Eric Abidal are sidelined along with forward Bojan Krkic. Messi record as Barcelona bounce back . Guardiola has called up fullback Martin Montoya and midfielders Thiago and Sergi Roberto from the reserve team. Mourinho has welcomed back loan striker Emmanuel Adebayor and winger Angel Di Maria, who missed Saturday's 6-3 win at Valencia due to injuries. But injured midfielders Sami Khedira and Fernando Gago missed training along with suspended defender Ricardo Carvalho, meaning France international Lassana Diarra has a chance of taking one of the holding roles.","Jose Mourinho tells his players that willpower can overcome the most powerful forces .

"(CNN) -- Somali pirates hijacked a yacht with four Americans onboard in the Indian Ocean, U.S. military officials said Saturday. The identities of the Americans were not immediately known, but the yacht, the S/V Quest, is owned by Jean and Scott Adam, according to Ecoterra International. It is not clear whether the Adams -- who were on a worldwide cruise -- are onboard. The U.S. military is prepared to intervene in the situation if necessary, said Rear Adm. Charles Gaouette, deputy commander of the U.S. Navy's Fifth Fleet, based in Bahrain. ""They were part of a sailing group that set sail from the southern tip of India into the western Indian Ocean,"" he said, adding that the situation is being monitored with U.S. Central Command. Gaouette said there is no reason to believe the hijacked yacht has been taken to the coastline of Somalia yet, though pirates in the region have been known to do so. Another U.S. official, who asked not to be named due to the sensitivity of the situation, said the United States is determining what military assets are in the region and the capabilities of the personnel onboard. The official said that the pirates are believed to be onboard the yacht with the Americans, and the next step would be to determine whether the military could keep the yacht from reaching the shore -- either by blocking or harassing it. Authorities said the yacht was en route from India to Oman when it was captured Friday. The Adams' website documents their worldwide voyage, which started in late 2004. It includes trips to New Zealand, China, Cambodia and Panama. ""If the  owners are onboard, it would be a sad log for the couple on their  seven-year world journey,"" Ecoterra said. The Adams were traveling with a group of somewhere between 14 and 30 other yachts taking part in what's called the Blue Water Rally, said Scott Stolnitz, a boater who described himself as a longtime friend of the couple. Stolnitz said Scott Adam had told him several weeks ago that he was concerned about pirate activity in the area, which he had never visited before, but was determined to traverse the world himself as opposed to shipping the boat -- as some other yacht owners have done. ""They weighed their options and decided they would join the rally for safety,"" Stolnitz said. On their website, the Adams say their mission ""is to allow the power of the Word to transform lives ... (and) seek fertile ground for the word and homes for our Bibles."" A post earlier this year said they would refuel in Djibouti waters, another pirate flash point. ""Djibouti is a big refueling stop,"" said the post, which is not dated. ""I have no idea what will happen in these ports, but perhaps we'll do some local touring."" Piracy has flourished off the coast of Somalia, which has not had an effective government for two decades. In April 2009, pirates seized the U.S.-flagged Maersk Alabama, leading to a standoff in the Indian Ocean. U.S. forces moved to rescue American Capt. Richard Phillips after seeing a pirate aiming a weapon on his back, officials said at the time. Three pirates were killed and one was arrested. The Somali man arrested was sentenced to more than 30 years in prison.

THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED. CARL AZUZ, CNN STUDENT NEWS ANCHOR: I'm Carl Azuz, and in today's show, we're talking about the U.S. economy, education, defense -- could be a presidential Cabinet meeting. And we're gonna be talking about the cabinet, too. CNN Student News starts right now! First Up: Afghanistan Violence . AZUZ: First up, violence in Afghanistan, where a gunfight broke out at an air force compound in Kabul. Eight U.S. service members and an American contractor were killed in the shooting Wednesday. Coalition officials said an Afghan military pilot started the gunfight. The Taliban said it's responsible for yesterday's shooting. The Taliban is the group that the U.S.-led coalition removed from power when the Afghanistan war started in 2001. A Taliban spokesman said the group had worked with the shooter. But coalition authorities -- and the shooter's brother -- denied that. The shooting happened at the North Kabul International Airport. Officials say it started as an argument between the Afghan pilot and an international colleague. That argument led to the gunfight. Defense Dept. Shift . AZUZ: Some changes getting ready to happen inside President Obama's administration. In fact, it's going to be one of the biggest shifts since Obama took office. And it starts with this man: Defense Secretary Robert Gates. Secretary Gates has been leading the Defense Department since George W. Bush was president. He stayed on at President Obama's request, but he's planning to retire later this year. And this is who President Obama wants to replace Secretary Gates: name is Leon Panetta. He's currently the director of the CIA. He also served as former President Bill Clinton's chief of staff. President Obama plans to nominate Director Panetta to be the new defense secretary. The U.S. Senate has to confirm him for that position. Obama Birth Certificate . AZUZ: That wasn't the only announcement at the White House yesterday. President Obama publicly showed off his birth certificate, which says that he was born in Honolulu, Hawaii. Okay. Why? Well, there are two requirements to be U.S. president. You have to be at least 35 years old, and you have to be a ""natural born"" citizen. Some people had doubts that President Obama was born in the U.S. They wanted to see this: his long-form birth certificate. Because without that proof, their argument was that he might be constitutionally ineligible to be president. This issue's gotten a lot of attention in the media recently. The White House released the birth certificate yesterday to try to put an end to the questions. Shoutout . TOMEKA JONES, CNN STUDENT NEWS: Today's Shoutout goes out to Ms. Cormican's enrichment class at Clinton Township Middle School in Clinton, New Jersey! What is the term for financial aid that companies get from the government? Here we go! Is it: A) Subsidy, B) Commodity, C) Liability or D) Security. You've got three seconds -- GO! Financial aid given out by the government is called a subsidy. That's your answer and that's your Shoutout! Gas Prices, Oil Profits . AZUZ: Subsidies are usually designed to help companies or industries that produce things for the public. For example, farmers might get money from the government to grow crops. This next report from Lisa Sylvester is about subsidies for the oil industry. With gas prices increasing, so are the questions about whether those subsidies should continue. (BEGIN VIDEO) LISA SYLVESTER, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: The oil and gas industry rakes in billions of dollars in profits a year. Last year, Exxon Mobil made more than $30 billion; Chevron, $19 billion; ConocoPhillips, more than $11 billion; and Royal Dutch/Shell, $20 billion. Meanwhile, it's costing consumers a load of money just to fill up their tank. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: There's no reason for the price to continue to go up, because there's lots of gas. I mean, lots of oil, I hear. SYLVESTER: Average price for regular gasoline is $3.87 a gallon. But in cities like Washington, D.C., gas at some stations is already at the $5 mark or higher. Those prices are expected to contribute to huge first-quarter profits for oil companies. On top of the mega-profits, the oil industry enjoys $4 billion in federal tax breaks. There's now a growing chorus to end those subsidies. FADEL GHEIT, FINANCIAL ANALYST, OPPENHEIMER AND COMPANY: The oil companies do not need subsidies, especially when you have $100 oil. It's outrageous for an oil company or oil lobbyist to ask for a subsidy when you have this high level of profitability. SYLVESTER: The American Petroleum Institute represents the largest oil companies. API's senior economic adviser, Rayola Dougher, says when profits are up, it's the shareholders who benefit. She says they are, for the most part, regular joes. RAYOLA DOUGHER, ECONOMIC ADVISER, AMERICAN PETROLEUM INSTITUTE: And at the end of the day, the final earnings, the profits to these companies, broadly go to tens of millions of Americans. Anybody with a 401(k), a pension plan, retired firefighters, teachers. These are the folks that, at the end of the day, benefit from these earnings. About 98.5 percent of the stock of these companies is broadly owned by the American people. SYLVESTER: The American Petroleum Institute says taking away those subsidies would be like a tax on the companies and could cost American jobs. But it is a hard case to make when so many Americans out there are getting squeezed at the gas pump, when we are seeing $5 a gallon for gasoline, and when the companies are making billions in profits. Lisa Sylvester, CNN, Washington. (END VIDEO) Southern Storms . AZUZ: This next headline is one you've heard a lot lately, and not one we like reporting: the southern U.S. recovering from another round of severe weather that plowed through the region yesterday. At least 12 deaths were reported. Hundreds of thousands of people lost power. This is what some Arkansas residents woke up to Wednesday morning: damaged buildings, downed trees, no power. That's from another storm system that moved through the South Tuesday night. And this severe weather may not be over. The National Weather Service issued tornado watches for parts of the South yesterday, as the storms worked their way east. In fact, there were 25 tornado warnings across parts of Alabama last night. And officials said a tornado hit the city of Cullman. These images you're seeing are some of the damage that was caused. Show Your Teacher Appreciation .

She's the correspondent for the ""In America"" programs, and we talked about what this new program is all about. (BEGIN VIDEO) AZUZ: Soledad O'Brien, you've worked on CNN's ""In America"" series. We've seen ""Black in America,"" ""Latino in America."" Your latest report is titled ""Don't Fail Me."" What's the story behind that title? SOLEDAD O'BRIEN, CNN ANCHOR, SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT: It really is an ""Education in America"" series. ""Don't Fail Me"" is the story of three students who represent different geographical and also socio-economical areas in the United States. And what we wanted to look at in that particular title was really the position students, American students, are in today. You know, American students rank 17th and 25 in math and science, respectively, in this country, when you look at all industrialized nations. Those are terrible, terrible, terrible statistics. And so, the question was: How do you change that? How do you move the United States back up to number one, where we used to be several decades ago? The question is really these three students, who are great students, ambitious students, motivated students. Who, their plea is very much ""don't fail me."" Sometimes teachers fail students, sometimes systems fail students, sometimes students fail themselves; they're not ambitious. In this particular case, we're looking at the entire educational system. Is it failing these young people? (END VIDEO) AZUZ: Those of you who participated in FIRST Robotics will wanna check this out too; that's part of this program. You are not going to want to miss it. ""Don't Fail Me"" airs on May 15th -- that's a Sunday night -- at 8 p.m. ET on CNN.

Before We Go . AZUZ: All right, before we go, we've got time for a speedy lesson. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Take your foot off the brake and we'll go forward. AZUZ: Move forward, all right. This ain't driver's ed. It's pace car 101. Rachel Gilbert's been a big NASCAR fan for 50 years. And since she's turning 100 years old today -- happy birthday -- her family got her an amazing gift: the chance to tool around the track in a pace car. Ms. Gilbert hasn't been behind the wheel of any car in about 16 years, but it was smooth sailing as she revved it up to about 50 miles per hour. Goodbye . AZUZ: Maybe this'll be her new motor -- mode or -- method of transportation. She probably bragged that she was going more than 50, but that's just rev-isionist history. Especially since the course tracked her speed. We were gonna drive through a few more of these puns, but we gotta learn to pace ourselves. So we'll brake for now. For CNN Student News, I'm Carl Azuz.

"(CNN)  -- Barcelona will parade their incredible six-trophy haul from 2009 as they begin the New Year with a home league clash against Villarreal on Saturday in the Camp Nou. Barca won an historic treble of Spanish league, Spanish Cup and and Champions League titles last season, their first under former captain Pep Guardiola. The Catalan giants added to the tally by scooping the Spanish and European Supercups and rounded off 2009 with victory in the World Club Cup last month, beating Estudiantes of Argentina in the final. They begin 2010 on course to repeat the initial treble and have a two-point lead over arch-rivals Real Madrid as La Liga resumes after a brief festive break. In celebration of their success, Barca have invited players who left the club in the summer, including Inter Milan striker Samuel Eto'o, to take part in the pre-match parade. Brazil star Dani Alves is keen for his teammates to maintain their winning spree and is hungry for more trophies. ""We'll do everything we can to make sure that this book has more than one page,"" he told the official club Web site www.fcbarcelona.com. ""We've achieved some really important stuff, but now we've got to keep on working hard and improving things,"" he added. Guardiola's team face possibly nine matches in a busy month and are also missing players on Africa Cup of Nations duty. Jeffren and Seydou Keita miss out through injury against Villarreal who drew 3-3 at the Camp Nou last season after being 3-1 down. Gonzalo Rodriguez is ruled out, but Villarreal, who are on a fine run of form, should be otherwise full-strength.

"(CNN) -- A deadly 2009 ""sweat lodge"" retreat in Arizona left participants so sickened that the scene resembled ""a battleground"" with people vomiting, foaming at the mouth and with their eyes nearly popping out, according to one survivor who testified Thursday. ""I saw people agonizing,"" said Lou Caci, a participant from Winnipeg, Manitoba. ""It looked like a battle ground. People are just laying there."" Caci, who earlier testified he fell at one point and badly burned his arm on the heated rocks, continued his testimony Thursday in the trial of self-help guru James Arthur Ray. Ray is accused of manslaughter in the deaths of three persons at his October 2009 ""Spiritual Warrior"" retreat in the desert. Killed were Kirby Brown, 38, of Westtown, New York; James Shore, 40, of Milwaukee, Wisconsin; and volunteer Lizbeth Marie Neuman, 49, of Prior Lake, Minnesota. At least 15 others who took part in the sweat lodge ceremony became ill, but more than 40 others were uninjured, and defense lawyers have argued that the deaths were accidental. James Ray's attorneys have also argued that exposure to an unknown toxin, perhaps a pesticide, could have caused the fatalities. The event participants paid up to $10,000 to seek ""new areas of consciousness,"" according to this week's testimony. The lodge -- made of willow trees and branches, and covered with tarpaulins and blankets -- was heated to perilously high temperatures, causing the participants to suffer dehydration and heatstroke. The sweat lodge ceremony consisted of eight rounds, with each round lasting 10 to 15 minutes. While they were not prevented from leaving, participants have said they were encouraged to wait until the breaks between rounds. Under questioning by the prosecution, Caci recounted how he re-entered the sweat lodge and came across one participant, Neuman. She was among those who died. ""Seeing the way Liz was I knew there was something terribly wrong. I was a bit apprehensive about being back in there just because of the pain I had in my arm. We finished the last ceremony and I was more focused on staying awake,"" Caci told the court. ""She was a heavy-set woman and I couldn't quite get her out. So a fellow named Randy helped me,"" Caci said. ""I was lifting her little by little. She was heavy. Randy was helping me. We would go, 'One, two, three' -- and we would lift. I think her face dragged on the ground a little bit, but we helped her out.""","Self-help guru James Arthur Ray is on trial for manslaughter of three persons .

"United Nations (CNN) -- The Sri Lankan government cried foul Tuesday after a U.N. panel said it has found credible allegations of war crimes and crimes against humanity committed by both sides during the final stages of the country's civil war. A government spokesman called the panel's report ""unacceptable,"" while Sri Lanka's External Affairs Ministry said the report is ""fundamentally flawed"" and based on ""patently biased material."" The Tamil National Alliance, the main Tamil opposition party in parliament, once dubbed as a ""proxy"" to Tamil Tiger rebels during the conflict, said it concurs with the findings. In the U.N. report released Monday, the three-member panel recommends the government of Sri Lanka immediately conduct an investigation into the alleged violations of international law and take other measures to ""advance accountability."" In a statement, U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon's spokesman said Ban ""sincerely hopes that this advisory report will make a contribution to full accountability and justice so that the Sri Lankan government and people will be able to proceed towards national reconciliation and peace."" Human rights groups have already alleged that both government troops and Tamil Tiger rebels violated humanitarian laws and that thousands of civilians were killed during the war, which ended in May 2009 after the government declared victory. The rebels had fought a 26-year bloody separatist war that left thousands dead and large numbers of others internally displaced, according to the United Nations. The U.N. panel started investigating in September 2010 and submitted its report April 12, the United Nations said. The decision to release the report now was made in order to be transparent and serve the public interest, Ban's spokesman said. Sri Lanka's government ""strongly rejected"" the report by what it called an ""illegal advisory committee."" In a response posted last week on the country's official government news portal, it called the report ""biased, baseless and unilateral."" The report focuses on the final phase of the military campaign to defeat the rebels, a phase that has been shrouded in controversy in part because local and international media were barred from access to the battle zones. Sri Lanka's government and the rebels have denied war crimes allegations. Sri Lankan President Mahinda Rajapaksa has also said ""not one civilian was shot dead"" by government troops. The panel, however, said its findings reveal ""a very different version"" of events than that maintained by the government. It said it found ""credible allegations, which if proven, indicate that a wide range of serious violations of international humanitarian law and international humanitarian rights law was committed both by the government of Sri Lanka and the LTTE (rebels), some of which would amount to war crimes and crimes against humanity."" In the war's final stage, which lasted from September 2008 to May 2009, the Sri Lankan army advanced into an area of northern Sri Lanka known as the Vanni, where about 330,000 people were trapped by fighting. The report said the government used ""large-scale and widespread shelling"" that left large numbers of civilians dead. Some of the shelling happened in no-fire zones where the government had encouraged civilians to congregate, the report said. Government forces also shelled a U.N. hub, food distribution lines and near ships belonging to the International Committee of the Red Cross that were picking up the wounded and their relatives from beaches, the report said. The government also shelled hospitals on the front lines, some of them repeatedly, the report said. ""Most civilian casualties in the final phases of the war were caused by government shelling,"" it said. While government forces screened civilians for suspected rebels, some civilians were summarily executed and some of the women may have been raped, the report said. Others disappeared, and some of those detained in camps were tortured, it added. The rebels, meanwhile, used civilians as hostages or human shields during the fighting, the report found. Tamil Tiger rebels also used forced recruitment -- including of children as young as 14 -- and forced civilians to dig trenches and other military positions, blurring the distinction between combatants and civilians and exposing the latter to further harm, it said. Starting in February 2009, the rebels also started ""point-blank shooting of civilians"" who tried to flee the conflict zone, the report found. ""I pray to God every day to give strength and courage to the secretary general of the United Nations, for him to do the right thing for the sake of tens of thousands of men and women, young and old, able and disable, (who) died in vain or have disappeared without trace,"" Father S.J. Emmanuel, head of the Global Tamil Forum, said from London. ""In my opinion for any meaningful and sustainable reconciliation to succeed, accountability for the past is mandatory."" Sri Lanka's president has already appointed a Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission, saying it would be sufficient to investigate allegations of war crimes, but the U.N. panel called the commission ""deeply flawed"" and ineffective. ""The government's notion of accountability is not in accordance with international standards,"" the panel said. Instead, the panel recommended the government start ""genuine investigations"" into the allegations. It also said Sri Lanka should take other immediate measures including facilitating the recovery and return of human remains to their families; provide death certificates for the dead and missing; release all displaced people and facilitate their return; and disclose the fate and location of people reported to have been ""forcibly disappeared."" For suspected rebels, the panel said, the government should publish the names of all those detained; allow detainees regular access to family members and legal counsel; and either charge or release detainees. The United Nations itself did not escape some criticism. The panel recommended a review of U.N. actions during and after the war, looking at how it implemented humanitarian and protection mandates. Ban's spokesman said he would ""respond positively"" to that recommendation. Journalist Iqbal Athas contributed to this report.","The opposition party says it concurs with the findings .

"(CNN) -- Bomb blasts Monday in Nigeria's northeastern state of Borno killed three people and wounded dozens, raising fears that an Islamist group will step up attacks against voters on the eve of national governorship elections, police said. In one of three blasts, a bomb thrown from a motorcycle on which two young men were riding detonated, resulting in the three fatalities, said Michael Zukoma, police commissioner for Borno state. Nigerian police told CNN that Boko Haram, an Islamist sect that has challenged Nigeria's government, is responsible for the attacks, which they described as an attempt to intimidate voters who this month re-elected President Goodluck Jonathan, an ljaw Christian from the south. The explosions occurred a day after the Nigerian Red Cross reported that rural villages had held mass burials in northern Nigeria. Witnesses say that violence in the wake of Jonathan's election has resulted in hundreds of deaths, though there is no official death toll. The government has provided few details. This month's election of Jonathan, who is from the majority-Christian southern part of the country, sparked violence in the Muslim-dominated north last week. Concerns about ongoing violence led Nigerian election officials last week to delay the planned gubernatorial elections in two of Nigeria's 36 states. Northern Muslims in some areas charged that the presidential election was rigged. Armed protesters in the region took to the streets chanting the name of former military ruler Muhammadu Buhari, the main opposition front-runner. The last election, four years ago, was widely condemned for rampant vote rigging, violence, theft of ballot boxes and intimidation. While this month's presidential election was marred by violence, reports of underage voting and logistical problems, observers said they considered it an improvement. After he was declared the victor, Jonathan warned that persistent post-election violence could threaten the stability of the country. ""These acts of mayhem are sad reminders of the events which plunged our country into 30 months of an unfortunate civil war,"" Jonathan said last week. Jonathan was referring to a period of unrest in the 1960s that spawned a civil war in Nigeria. Nigeria is Africa's largest oil producer and its most populous nation, with 150 million people.","NEW: All three fatalities came from a single bomb blast .

"Washington (CNN) -- For hours on March 21, U.S. Air Force Maj. Kenneth Harney of Lexington, Kentucky, and Capt. Tyler Stark of Littleton, Colorado, were the focus of nearly every U.S. service member in the Mediterranean Sea region. Nearly a dozen aircraft, a platoon of Marines and even Libyan civilians worked to rescue Harney and Stark after their F-15 crashed in eastern Libya. Most details about the mission, including their names, were a closely held secret by the military. But earlier this month, with little notice, their identities and details of their rescue came out during a welcome-home ceremony at their air base. For the first time, the men spoke publicly to a small group of friends, family and Air Force personnel. The Air Force public affairs office posted pictures and video of the event on its official website, even after U.S. military public affairs officers involved in Operation Odyssey Dawn in Libya told CNN their names would never be made public. ""You feel the weight of not only the Air Force, but the entire military, focusing on you, making sure you get home,"" Stark said recently in a video prepared by the Air Force. U.S. still not ready to recognize Libyan opposition . The men were part of a the 48th Fighter Wing normally based at RAF Lakenheath, a Royal Air Force base that has hosted U.S. Air Force units for years in Suffolk, England. But on March 21 they took off from the U.S. air base in Aviano, Italy, in support of the no-fly zone enforcement over Libya. At some point they ran into trouble. ""We soon find ourselves in a situation where we are forced to eject over potentially hostile territory, and over the country of Libya. Something that neither one of us would ever have thought that we'd have to do,"" Harney, the pilot of the Strike Eagle said. The Air Force is still trying to figure out why the plane crashed and a post-incident investigation is ongoing, but four days after the crash, Vice Adm. Bill Gortney, director of the Joint Staff at the Pentagon, told reporters that the military was ""confident that it is not a result of hostile fire."" Homes destroyed in battle for Misrata . After the ejection, Harney -- ""Meso"" to his fellow fliers -- and ""Mask"" Stark became separated. ""When you find yourself alone, and you're isolated, in a country where there's hostiles, you are scared,"" said Harney, a veteran of both the Afghan and Iraq wars. Stark was found by Libyan civilians who protected him from possible retaliation by forces loyal to Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi, and eventually he was taken safely back to Europe. Details of how he was taken out of Libya have yet to be disclosed. Harney's rescue came more quickly. He stayed in communications with another F-15 pilot still in the air over Libya. Eventually an MV-22 Osprey carrying Marines who were part of a Tactical Recovery of Aircraft and Personnel, or TRAP, team landed near his position. ""As that back door opened, I see a group of young Marine recon units jump out, and that was probably the best feeling I've ever felt in my entire life,"" Harney said. He was flown to the USS Kearsarge for a quick medical check then a short time later sent home with Stark to RAF Lakenheath, where friends and family welcomed them with hugs and a rendition of ""God Bless America.""","Two Air Force fliers went down over Libya on March 21 .

"(CNN) -- FBI agents are traveling to Peru to study a laptop belonging to Joran Van der Sloot -- who was arrested twice in connection with the Natalee Holloway case, but was not charged -- according to a Lima court document. The Alabama teen disappeared during a high school graduation trip to Aruba in 2005. Van der Sloot was the last person to be seen with Holloway. A source close to the case told InSession the FBI will be searching for any clues that can help solve the Holloway case. Van der Sloot also faces federal wire fraud and extortion charges in the United States, where prosecutors say he demanded more than $250,000 from Holloway's family in return for disclosing the location of her body. The Lima court document says the unnamed FBI agents will meet March 14 with two agents of the Peruvian National Police High Technology Crime Division at the Peruvian National Police Headquarters in Lima. During the meeting they will have access to the computer's hard drive and will be able to conduct forensic examinations on it. Van der Sloot, a Dutch national, faces charges in another case. He is accused of first-degree murder and robbery in the case of 21-year-old Stephany Flores. Authorities found Flores' body in a Lima hotel room registered to him in June last year. Van der Sloot's attorney and a representative for the Flores family are expected to be present March 14. The lawyer for Van der Sloot said Monday he has asked the court to charge his client with the lesser offense of manslaughter in Flores' death. ""In his statement to the police, Joran admitted that he committed the crime, but it was not in the way that the police said it happened,"" said attorney Maximo Altez. ""We have submitted a motion to show that he shouldn't be charged with aggravated murder, but with violent emotion murder.""

"(CNN)  -- Real Madrid coach Jose Mourinho has stood by his post-match tirade against officialdom after his side lost 2-0 to bitter rivals Barcelona in the first leg of their Champions League semifinal tie Wednesday. Mourinho spoke of a ""scandal"" and favoritism towards Barca as both he and central defender Pepe were sent off in the second half. Down to 10-men, Barcelona brilliantly exploited the advantage in the Bernabeu and scored two late goals through Lionel Messi. UEFA said Thursday that it had started a disciplinary inquiry into the unsavory incidents which marred the clash of the Spanish giants. Barcelona are also lodging an official complaint to the European governing body after Mourinho's comments. But Mourinho told gathered reporters Friday that he would have no more to say on the subject, claiming pictures of the incidents would back up his claims. Blog: No way Jose, you've gone too far this time . ""An image is worth more than a thousand words. I said what I said and I have nothing to add,"" he told the official Real Madrid website. ""Whoever criticizes my words must criticize the images and think that the photos have been edited by photoshop and that the video was staged."" Mourinho said he would be resting key players for this weekend's Spanish league match against Real Zaragoza ahead of the return tie in the Nou Camp Tuesday. Despite his pessimism about the eventual outcome after Wednesday's defeat, the Portuguese coach refused to write off Real's season. ""Our morale is good in all aspects.

"New Delhi, India (CNN) -- Famed Indian spiritual guru Sri Sathya Sai Baba was laid to rest Wednesday as hundreds of thousands of followers bid a tearful farewell to the ascetic they revered as a living god. Hymns rang through his ashram at his hometown of Puttaparthi in southern India as his body was sprinkled with petals and holy water before a private burial behind a maroon curtain. Hindu funerals generally involve cremation, but infants and saintly figures are buried. Sri Sathya Sai Baba died Sunday at age 85 of respiratory failure. A number of luminaries attended the funeral conducted with full state honors. On Tuesday, Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and the Italian-born head of his Congress party, Sonia Gandhi, paid their tribute as they filed past the guru's saffron-robed body placed in a glass casket and sat beside it as a mark of respect. Recognizable with his trademark puff of dark hair, Sri Sathya Sai Baba claimed to be a reincarnation of Sai Baba of Shirdi, one of India's greatest spiritual leaders, who died in 1918. Devotees believed Sri Sathya Sai Baba had supernatural powers. However, critics accused him of fraud and sexual abuse -- allegations he denied. In a hospital bulletin on Sunday, doctors did not use the word 'death' to announce his passing. It said he was ""no more with us physically"" and that he left ""his earthly body."" In his condolence message on the day Sri Sathya Sai Baba died, Singh remembered the spiritual leader for inspiring millions to lead a meaningful life regardless of their religions. ""His teachings were rooted in the universal ideals of truth, right conduct, peace, love and nonviolence,"" Singh said.","Sri Sathya Sai Baba is buried in a state funeral .

"Washington (CNN) -- When President Obama unveiled his revamped national security team in the East Room, he quickly joked about how badly Defense Secretary Robert Gates has been itching to finally get serious about retirement. ""When I took office, Bob Gates had already served under seven presidents, and he carried a clock that counted down the days, hours, and minutes until he could return to Washington state with his wife, Becky,"" Obama said. He added that he felt lucky to get Gates to keep pushing the exit date back to deal with wars in Afghanistan and Iraq as well as some major budget decisions confronting the nation. First it was Obama during the presidential transition in December 2008 getting Gates to stay on for just one more year for continuity's sake. Then that grew to staying on for first 2½ years of the administration. Senior officials tell me that Obama had even been hoping to somehow persuade Gates to stay on through all four years of the first term for the good of the country, but the president finally gave in and then set his sights to twisting the reluctant arm of CIA Director Leon Panetta to delay his own retirement to take the top spot at the Pentagon. Obama shuffles familiar faces in key security roles . As Obama noted to laughter about his lobbying of Gates, ""At some point along the way, Bob threw out that clock."" It was an apt metaphor, because top defense analysts say the clock is ticking on the Obama administration as its first -- and possibly only -- term in office winds down. ""The timing right now is really critical in terms of how the resources will get sorted out,"" said David Berteau, head of the defense industrial practice at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. Berteau is referring to the fact that Panetta and the rest of the new team will have just 18 months to deal with the arduous task of somehow squeezing hundreds of billions of dollars out of the planned Pentagon budget for the next decade or so -- it's pretty much impossible to find a way to get the numbers in Obama's deficit-cutting plan to add up without significant defense savings. And they have to do this while winding down two very expensive wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, trying to help finish the mission in Libya, preparing for possible conflicts anywhere from Syria to North Korea, all the while trying to figure out how things will settle down in the Mideast. No wonder Panetta had to have his arm twisted to take this job, and he even joked to the crowd that the departing Gates was easy to spot at the event because he was the ""guy with the big smile next to me"" on the platform. Panetta immediately noted the mind-numbing change the world has witnessed in recent months. ""As the son of immigrants, I was raised to believe that we cannot be free unless we are secure,"" he said. ""Today we are a nation at war. And job one will be to ensure that we are the strongest military power in the world to protect that security that is so important to this country."" Panetta's other big task will be trying to deal with the competing goals of protecting America's military superiority and drastically reducing the Pentagon's $550 billion annual budget. The former White House chief of staff and budget director in the Clinton administration said he is committed to finding that balance. New men, new missions at Pentagon and CIA . He called it ""a time for hard choices."" ""It's about ensuring that we are able to prevail in the conflicts in which we are now engaged,"" Panetta said. ""But it's also about being able to be strong and disciplined in applying our nation's limited resources to defending America."" Panetta emphasized that ""none of this will be easy,"" and administration officials say privately this is a major reason why the president was so heavily focused on picking experienced old hands to round out the new(ish) national security team, with Gen. David Petraeus nominated to replace Panetta at the CIA. While some critics have dismissed the changes as a game of musical chairs, it's worth noting the people filling those chairs are heavily respected on both sides of the aisle. When was the last time you heard a Republican touting the ""honesty and integrity"" of an Obama nominee as House Intelligence Chairman Mike Rogers, R-Michigan, did? ""While I'm sorry to see Mr. Panetta go (from the CIA), his talent and leadership will be put to great use leading the Defense Department,"" Rogers said. ""Mr. Gates is leaving huge shoes to fill at the Pentagon, and I can't imagine a better candidate to replace him."" There has also been praise for the selections from Republicans like Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, a senior member of the Armed Services Committee who will vote on the nominations of Panetta and Lt. Gen. John Allen, who has been nominated to replace Petraeus as the allied commander of the war in Afghanistan. Obama also nominated the highly respected Ryan Crocker to serve as the new U.S. ambassador in Afghanistan ahead of the July deadline that is fast approaching, which the president has held up as a pivot point for starting to bring home U.S. troops. Besides being experienced, many of these players know each other very well. When the war in Iraq was falling apart, it was then-President George W. Bush's decision to install Petraeus as the commander on the ground and Crocker as the U.S. ambassador in Baghdad -- with Allen serving under Petraeus on the military side -- that was one of the pivotal moments that got the mission back on track. ""I mean Petraeus and Crocker were the 'Dream Team' in Iraq,"" Berteau said. ""These guys have all worked together."" That is significant because an administration can sometimes waste months and months getting key players to gel. ""It provides the opportunity to get things done because you don't have to waste your time in transition,"" said Berteau. The time needs to be used wisely to tackle all of the challenges the team will face in the next year and a half, including nothing short of the most momentous transformation of the American military in a couple of decades. Bennett: Why Panetta, Petraeus are smart choices . ""We are about to embark on the next big defense drawdown,"" Berteau said. ""Panetta is uniquely qualified because he was at the White House during the last big drawdown in the early 1990s."" Indeed, Panetta served as White House chief of staff and the budget director during the Clinton administration and helped balance the federal budget. He was able then to benefit from his previous tenure as chairman of the House Budget Committee, and he will be able to draw upon that deep reservoir of respect again now. ""I am pleased that my friend Leon Panetta will bring his long record of service, first in Congress and then in both the Clinton and Obama administrations, to the job of secretary of defense,"" said Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada. ""Director Panetta is taking the helm at a crucial time for the Pentagon, in the midst of two wars and as we close in on our July deadline to begin the drawdown of troops from Afghanistan. We need the kind of experienced leadership he can provide."" The budget battles ahead will only be further complicated by the 2012 campaign, of course, as both parties trade charges and potentially move farther from compromise. And if Obama ends up losing the race, the clock is ticking on Panetta to leave the administration's imprint on the Pentagon budget for the next decade to come. Obama, of course, hopes to win a second term. And just as Gates jokingly thanked Obama for ""inviting me to stay on -- and on and on,"" the president seems to already be lobbying Panetta to stay beyond the next 18 months. At the East Room event, Obama noted that after 40 years in public service, Panetta had wanted to go home to retirement with his wife. ""Leon, I know that you've been looking forward to returning now to Sylvia and your beautiful Monterey, so I thank you for taking on yet another assignment for our country,"" Obama said, adding with a sly smile: ""And I hope you don't have a clock.""","Defense analysts say time is of the essence in sorting out security resources .

"Tokyo (CNN) -- Thousands of Japanese filled evacuation shelters or joined foreigners seeking a way out of the country Thursday in the aftermath of last week's devastating earthquake, tsunami and resulting nuclear crisis at stricken reactors. Cold, snowy weather in parts of the Asian nation further heightened the hardship of a nation facing what its leaders call its biggest disaster since World War II. Fears of possible nuclear catastrophe were evident. After rallying Wednesday, stocks in Japan fell early Thursday, with the Nikkei 225 index, the most prominent measure of stocks traded in Tokyo, down about 2% in early trading. Concerns spread far beyond Japan's borders, with U.S. stock markets falling and the U.S. military dispatching a radiation-sniffing aircraft to determine if toxic clouds were rising from disabled reactors. Nearly 13,000 people are dead or missing and several hundred thousand have been left homeless from Friday's earthquake and tsunami. An extraordinary television address Wednesday by Emperor Akihito showed the magnitude of the catastrophe. Such a speech by a sitting emperor is usually reserved for times of extreme crisis or war, and Emperor Akihito's direct appeal to the public was the first time he has spoken to the public amid such a crisis. ""I truly hope the victims of the disaster never give up hope, take care of themselves, and live strong for tomorrow,"" said the dignified and understated Emperor Akihito, in a calm and poignant oration delivered from the Imperial Palace. ""Also, I want all citizens of Japan to remember everyone who has been affected by the devastation, not only today but for a long time afterwards -- and help with the recovery."" The 77-year-old ceremonial but deeply revered chief of state underlined Prime Minister Naoto Kan's earlier assertion that Japan is going through its worst crisis since World War II. The emperor delivered his speech on the same day that white smoke and a new blaze at the damaged Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant added to radiation fears. ""Currently, the entire nation is putting forth its best effort to save all suffering people. However, under the severe cold weather, evacuees are having a very difficult time because they lack food, water, and energy sources,"" he said. ""Also, I am deeply concerned that the current nuclear plant situation is critical. I truly hope that with so many people working together to help, the situation will not worsen."" On Thursday morning, helicopters operated by Japan's self-defense forces made four passes over the plant's No. 3 reactor to dump water. Public broadcaster NHK reported that at least 12 water-cannon trucks would be brought in, so that forces could try to douse the reactor from the ground, . While Japan has called for anyone living within 12 miles of the disable nuclear plant to evacuate, Great Britain and the United States dramatically expanded their evacuation warnings Wednesday, telling their respective citizens within 50 miles to either stay indoors or move away. It was the first time since the nuclear crisis began that the United States and Japanese governments have differed on advising what their citizens should do. Before Wednesday, the United States had urged American citizens in Japan to follow the recommendations of the Japanese government. A cloud of smoke seen at the stricken plant sparked fear there might have been a breach in the containment vessel in the nuclear plant's No. 3 reactor, government officials said. Earlier explosions and fires also had hit other reactors at the plant. Officials asked workers at the plant to evacuate Wednesday after the cloud rose above the plant and radiation levels spiked. The levels later fell and authorities allowed the workers to return, the Tokyo Electric Power Company said. Tests on tap water in Fukushima city, 80 kilometers (50 miles) away found radiation -- though at levels not harmful to the human body, and later tests showed no radiation in the water, government officials said. Officials have been working to resolve cooling problems at four of Fukushima Daiichi's six reactors in the wake of the 9.0-magnitude earthquake and ensuing tsunami. Japanese authorities could not rule out the possibility of a meltdown at the troubled reactors. Workers have been pumping sea water into reactors in an effort to prevent further damage. A meltdown occurs when nuclear fuel rods cannot be cooled, thus melting the reactor core and causing a release of radioactivity. In the worst-case scenario, the fuel can spill out of the containment unit and spread toxic radioactivity through the air and water. That, public health officials say, can cause both immediate and long-term health problems, including radiation poisoning and cancer. As the government and workers scrambled to stabilize the plant, the search continued for survivors from last week's cruel combination of natural disasters. By Wednesday night, the National Police Agency reported 4,314 deaths. Another 8,606 people are missing and 2,282 were injured, the agency said. The number of dead is expected to go up as rescuers reach more hard-hit areas. Public broadcaster NHK has reported that 450,000 people were living in shelters, where people grieved over lost loved ones and worried about relatives who are missing from villages and towns inundated by the tsunami waves off the east coast of Honshu. Thousands of people packed Narita International Airport in Tokyo, with some sitting on floors. ""We just headed for the mountains directly away from the nuclear power station,"" Richard Struthers, who lives about 70 kilometers (43 miles) from the Fukushima plant. He said he is ""taking no chances"" with his baby son. Boris Suban of Moriya -- about 210 kilometers (130 miles) from the nuclear plant -- decided to travel across the country to Hiroshima prefecture -- a location he admits is ironic. U.S. planes dropped atomic bombs on the cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki during World War II. 'We thought that the reactor is not safe and too near,"" Suban said. ""Plus, if the panic spreads, we will be unable to leave Japan and get the full exposure sitting on our sofa."" Meanwhile, across the country, emergency workers from Japan, foreign governments and international aid groups continued to scour tangled and displaced piles of debris, searching for survivors. Scores of countries, regions and international organizations have offered assistance, according to the Japanese foreign affairs ministry. Rescue work is being complicated by the hundreds of aftershocks that have rocked Japan since Friday's quake. Since the initial earthquake, the U.S. Geological Survey has reported about 35 quakes with magnitudes of 6.0 or greater, and more than 200 others greater than 5.0. John Roos, the U.S. ambassador to Japan, said the U.S. military has delivered over 7,000 pounds of food and water to the disaster area so far and more than $5.8 million of U.S. aid has come to Japan. He said nine U.S. ships are assisting in the relief operations, and helicopters and other aircraft have now flown over 50 missions to conduct survivor recoveries, transport passengers, and distribute food and water supplies in the most needy areas. Donations rolled in. Delta Air Lines is pledging $1 million in cash and ""in-kind support"" to disaster relief efforts, for example. Meanwhile, the crisis has rekindled debate and concern over nuclear power. Energy Secretary Steven Chu told members of Congress Wednesday that the Obama White House still backs the further development of American nuclear power -- a stance opposed by some key congressional Democrats. Spanish Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero announced Wednesday that the government will review safety at all of Spain's nuclear power plants. The massive quake was the strongest in recorded history to hit Japan, according to USGS records that date to 1900.

"(CNN) -- Astronaut Mark Kelly visits U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords twice a day, witnessing and aiding her recovery from a devastating bullet wound suffered nearly four months ago. Friday, the Arizona congresswoman will witness her husband's own inspiring moment: Commanding the space shuttle Endeavour on its last launch. Doctors have cleared Giffords, who was shot in the brain at a January 8 event in Tucson, to attend the scheduled launch in Florida, a source close to her said Sunday. The source told CNN Senior Medical Correspondent Elizabeth Cohen that Giffords will be accompanied by a nurse. There will be no doctor or medical assistance on board. The source was not sure what kind of plane Giffords will be going on, but it will not be a commercial airliner. ""She'll probably be going either Wednesday or Thursday,"" the source said. Asked by ""The CBS Evening News With Katie Couric"" what Giffords' reaction was to the decision allowing her to go, Kelly replied, ""I think she said, 'awesome' and she pumped her fist."" Kelly's comments on the flight and his wife's recovery will be broadcast on CBS Monday evening. The network Sunday released excerpts of the conversation. Giffords, who is recovering at TIRR Memorial Hermann hospital in Houston, won't meet with the media or make a statement while she is at Kennedy Space Center in Florida for the 36th shuttle mission to the International Space Station. Doctors and friends have spoken of Giffords' strong recovery. She speaks in short sentences, walks with a cart for therapy and has full use of her left side. Kelly told CBS that Giffords' ""personality's a hundred percent there. You know, it's difficult for her to walk. The communication skills are difficult, at this point."" Democratic Rep. Debbie Wasserman-Schultz of Florida, one of those present at the hospital when Giffords first opened her eyes after surgery, recently said her friend ""continues to make remarkable progress, has a little bit more mobility now ... is a lot more responsive, interactive and initiating speech."" Gabrielle Giffords for Senate? Earlier this month, CNN's Sanjay Gupta visited Giffords' Arizona medical team, including Dr. Peter Rhee, the trauma chief at University Medical Center, where Giffords was treated. ""I'll tell you she's not going to be 100%, I know that for a fact. She has a scar on her head, she's going to have multiple scars on her. And what you see on the outside is also reflective of what goes on inside underneath it as well,"" said Rhee. ""So while we cover it up, there are a lot of things that are permanently damaged that won't ever come back. Is she going to be the same as she was before? I think she's going to have permanent changes in thoughts and memories and feelings and emotions, so we'll have to see how that pans out in the future . But I think she'll be doing very well."" Family from Giffords shooting wants ammo limit . Kelly will be commanding a crew of four other Americans and one astronaut from the European Space Agency. Liftoff is scheduled for 3:47 p.m. ET Friday.

"(CNN) -- Zack Snyder evidently had an awesome idea for a video game. But for some reason, he decided to do it as a movie first. I mean, it's playing in movie theatres, so I guess you would have to call it a movie, albeit a sorry excuse for one. Snyder has accrued some status with younger fans through his boldly stylized retakes on George Romero's ""Dawn of the Dead,"" Frank Miller's ""300"" and Alan Moore's ""Watchmen."" So far, the raw material has been distinctive enough to camouflage Snyder's increasingly threadbare bag of tricks: toggling between slow and fast motion, extreme close-ups and vertiginous long shots. He feeds back the kind of bastardized cinematic effects that comic books, pop videos and games took from film in the first place. It's a high-impact, low-return aesthetic that promotes a tawdry gloss above character and story. Talking of which, ""Sucker Punch"" is Snyder's first stab at original material. And when I say ""stab,"" I mean he prods at it anxiously with a long blade, as if he wants to make sure it's well and truly dead. If Snyder has any call on the attention of a reasonably intelligent adult -- and on the evidence of this sleazy atrocity, that's a mighty big ""if"" -- it's as a pioneer of a post-narrative cinema, in which sensation and spectacle are paramount and situation is as fluid as a digital composite. Here he conjures giants, zeppelins, and dragons all in the blink of an eye. But are these things enough when they come out of thin air? Clearly not, as ""Sucker Punch"" falls back repeatedly on the hoariest of melodramatic cliches. And so we're treated to orphaned sisters abused and (in one case) murdered by an evil stepfather, who commits the surviving girl (Emily Browning) to an asylum and bribes the warden to arrange a lobotomy. All this within the first three minutes. Browning ­-- known only as ""Baby Doll"" -- contrives a mental escape route into an alternative reality, a bordello/burlesque house. But this, too, is a dangerous place controlled by rapacious men. She finds another rabbit hole in performing interpretative dance routines (which we never see) that transfix her captors, while projecting herself and her fellow inmates ­-- including Abbie Cornish and Vanessa Hudgens -- into virtual reality adventure game scenarios: a Shaolin temple duel; a WWI assignment behind enemy lines; a ticking time bomb; etc., etc. iReporter: One out of five for ""Sucker Punch"" On some level, these episodes are configured as empowering fantasies; the girls are pulling the triggers, after all. They're also heavily fetishized affairs involving high heels, suspenders and plenty of skin. Kudos to Snyder (who co-wrote the screenplay with Steve Shibuya) for letting his imagination run wild. It's just a pity that imagination is so drastically circumscribed by the lurid ""ho couture"" culture of shoot-em-ups and soft porn. In the end, what can you say about a filmmaker who thinks nothing of laying a cover of the Eurythmics' ""Sweet Dreams"" (lyric: ""Some of them want to abuse you"") over scenes of a man menacing two young girls? Or the Pixies' magisterial ""Where Is My Mind"" over the committal scene? That Snyder is unafraid of overstatement? Or that he imagines an audience as lobotomized as his benumbed Baby Doll? See, the suckers here are the poor mugs who leave their dollars at the door. And for what? A seedy, desaturated, overstimulated simulation of a real movie. Schlock treatment for comatose gamers, and a bomb with a bright pink cherry on top.","""Sucker Punch"" stars Emily Browning, Abbie Cornish, Vanessa Hudgens .

"Berlin (CNN) -- German Defense Minister Karl-Theodor Freiherr zu Guttenberg resigned Tuesday, in the wake of claims that he had plagiarized parts of his doctoral dissertation. Guttenberg is quitting all political posts, he said, adding that he was ""taking the step that I would expect others to take."" He said he was stepping down not only because of the dissertation, but because the issue was becoming a distraction. ""When I become the center of attention on the backs of the soldiers who I'm responsible for, then I cannot justify remaining in office,"" he said. ""Because the German army, the academic community, and the parties who back me are in danger of being damaged, I am taking the step that I would expect others to take,"" he concluded. He'll stay in place until Chancellor Angela Merkel chooses a replacement, she said, adding she had ""accepted Karl Theodore's resignation with a heavy heart. ""Now is not the time to speculate about a successor,"" she added. The resignation is likely to have a significant effect on Germany's coalition government. Guttenberg, 39, is a member of the Christian Social Union party, closely allied with Merkel's Christian Democratic Union. Guttenberg studied law and politics in Bayreuth and Munich, according to his official biography. He had been defense minister since October 2009.","NEW: He will stay in place until a successor is chosen, Chancellor Angela Merkel says .

"(CNN) -- Real Madrid and Barcelona face disciplinary action from European football's governing body following Wednesday's fiery Champions League semifinal between the two Spanish clubs. UEFA said on Thursday that Real coach Jose Mourinho could be punished for being sent to the stands after Pepe was sent off, and then making an ""inappropriate statement"" after his team's 2-0 home first-leg defeat. His club could also be in trouble due to missile-throwing by fans and a pitch invasion at the Santiago Bernabeu, as well as Portugal international Pepe's dismissal for a lunge at Barcelona's Daniel Alves. Barcelona may also be charged at the May 6 hearing -- which comes after Tuesday's second leg in the Catalan capital -- due to the sending-off of reserve goalkeeper Jose Pinto during a halftime scuffle between both sets of players. CNN Blog: Has Jose gone too far this time? Barca later said on Thursday that the club would report Mourinho to UEFA for his astonishing tirade, which came despite the European body delaying the post-match interviews in order to give both teams time to calm down. Lionel Messi's double saw Barca plant one foot in the final, with both goals coming after makeshift midfielder Pepe was sent off by German referee Wolfgang Stark. Mourinho, who was sent to the stands after the red card for his ironic applause at the match officials, suggested that UEFA shows favoritism towards Barcelona. He claimed Barca's relationship with world children's charity UNICEF, and with Spanish football federation president Angel Maria Villar, contributed to their ""power"" and that the return leg next week was ""mission impossible."" Barcelona's official website reported Mourinho as saying: ""Josep Guardiola is a fantastic football coach, but he has won one Champions League which would embarrass me after the scandalous goings on at Stamford Bridge and this year if he wins it again it will be after the scandalous goings on at the Bernabeu. ""I don't know if it's the UNICEF publicity or the friendship of Villar at UEFA, where he is vice-president, I don't know if it's because they are so nice, but they have got great power. The rest of us have no chance."" Messi magic sinks 10-man Real Madrid . After an extraordinary meeting of the club's board of directors, Barcelona spokesman Tony Freixa said a complaint would be made to UEFA's disciplinary committee. ""We want to defend the history, prestige and reputation of our members, fans, players, coaches and directors, who with their hard work and their effort succeeded in winning the Champions League in 2009,"" Freixa said. ""It's unacceptable that someone questions our titles and our links with UNICEF."" The build-up to the match had been dominated by a war of words between Mourinho and Guardiola. Barca's players have been criticized for the pressure they put on the referee during the match but Guardiola refused to be drawn on Mourinho's outburst, telling reporters: ""I have nothing to say."" Mud-slinging continued between the players, however, with Real striker Emmanuel Adebayor telling Spanish newspaper AS: ""Whenever you play against Barca, whenever you touch them, they are on the floor crying like a baby."" Real also responded on the club's official website, posting a video that purportedly shows that Pedro made contact with the ball and not Alves. Madrid also claimed that Barcelona players Pedro and Sergio Busquets overly reacted when challenged by Alvaro Arbeloa and Marcelo during the game. The website published quotes from England footballers Rio Ferdinand and Michael Owen condemning Alves for diving, along with Irish golf star Rory McIlroy and NFL player Chad Ochocinco -- who also plays soccer.","UEFA announces disciplinary hearing into incidents at Santiago Bernabeu .

"(CNN) -- An American woman teaching English in Japan has been found dead, her family said Monday. Taylor Anderson, 24, had been missing since the tsunami struck earlier this month. She'd been teaching in Ishinomaki, Japan for the last three years, according to her parents. Ishinomaki, a city in Miyagi Prefecture, was hit hard by the 9.0-magnitude earthquake and tsunami. The disaster has killed more than 8,800 people and left close to 13,000 missing, many of them killed as a wall of water rushed in following the quake. ""We would like to thank all those whose prayers and support have carried us through this crisis. Please continue to pray for all who remain missing and for the people of Japan,"" her family said. The oldest of three children, Anderson was a native of Virginia. Her parents said she loved Japan, the culture and children. Some of her fellow teachers in Japan told CNN that Anderson hopped on her bike after the quake and likely tried to pedal home. The tsunami waters did not reach the school, though her home neighborhood was hit head on, they said. Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell released a statement, offering his support for Anderson's family and friends. He said Anderson is the first American reported to have been killed in the natural disasters. ""Fittingly, she was last seen helping parents safely reunite with their children following the earthquake, an act which illustrates her dedication to her students and to the Japanese people she served,"" McDonnell said.

"London, England (CNN) -- Britain's Prince William is engaged to Kate Middleton, and has given her the engagement ring his late mother Diana, Princess of Wales, got from his father, Prince Charles, he said Tuesday. ""It's my mother's enagagment ring, so of course it's very special to me, and Kate's now very special to me, so it was only right to put the two together,"" he said Tuesday. The ring, a huge sapphire surrounded by diamonds, was last seen in public on the day Charles and Diana divorced, royal biographer Mark Saunders told CNN. That was in 1996. Tuesday's announcement ends years of speculation about whether and when the prince would propose to his longtime girlfriend. The prince and Middleton, both 28, have been dating since 2003. Rumors have been rife for years that they were close to marriage. ""It was the right time and i'm very glad to have done it,"" William said in an appearance with Middleton. She said she had not always known he would propose. ""We had spoken about our future,"" she said. ""It just seemed a natural step for both of us."" ""We're obviously thrilled,"" said Prince Charles, as he toured Poundbury, an urban development project in Cornwall, with Atlanta, Georgia, Mayor Kasim Reed. ""They've been practicing long enough."" ""They make a lovely couple, they're great fun to be with and we've had a lot of laughs together,"" said Middleton's parents, Michael and Carole Middleton. ""We've got to know William really well. We all think he's wonderful and we're extremely fond of him. We wish them every happiness for the future."" The wedding will take place in London in the spring or summer of 2011, said a statement from Clarence House, William's home near Buckingham Palace. It said further details would be announced ""in due course."" ""Prince William and Miss Middleton became engaged in October during a private holiday in Kenya,"" the statement said. ""Prince William has informed the queen and other close members of his family. Prince William has also sought the permission of Miss Middleton's father. ""Following the marriage, the couple will live in north Wales, where Prince William will continue to serve with the Royal Air Force."" Buckingham Palace released a statement shortly afterward, saying Queen Elizabeth II and her husband, Prince Philip, are ""absolutely delighted for them both."" Clarence House refused to say what Middleton will be called after she gets married, saying any styles and titles are at the discretion of the queen. William is second line to the British throne after his father, Prince Charles. Queen Elizabeth is William's grandmother. He met Middleton in 2002 when both were students at the University of St. Andrews in Scotland. They started dating a year later. Prince William studied geography and Middleton studied history of art before both graduated in 2005. William was originally in the same art program but changed to geography; Middleton was widely credited with persuading him to change course rather than drop out. They first appeared as a couple on a skiing trip in Switzerland while still at the university. British Prime Minister David Cameron said he spoke to Prince William after the news was announced and passed on his congratulations. ""He was extremely excited about the news and thrilled about what lies in store,"" Cameron said. ""It's great to have a piece of unadulterated good news that everyone can celebrate,"" he added. ""I'm sure it will be something where the country will come together. ... It's two young people who love each other who've made this decision, and it's a fantastically important and exciting moment for them, too."" Middleton grew up in Bucklebury, England, a small village about 45 miles west of central London. Her parents are millionaire entrepreneurs who run Party Pieces, an online children's party supplies business. After university, Middleton worked in London as an accessories buyer for the British clothing chain Jigsaw but left the company in late 2007. Media reports said she was interested in opening a photography gallery. News reports since August have said she is working with her parents' business. Prince William has a military career and is active in several charities. In September, he graduated from a military search-and-rescue training course and was posted to RAF Valley, the station on the island of Anglesey in north Wales. He is known as Flight Lieutenant Wales within the RAF. Middleton lives with her fiance at a house in Anglesey, giving them some privacy from the press and paparazzi, said Eve Pollard, a former editor of the Sunday Mirror newspaper. The choice of 2011 as the year for the wedding makes sense, she said, because the Olympic Games take place in London in 2012, the same year the queen plans to celebrate her Diamond Jubilee, marking 60 years on the throne. ""Next year was always marked in as the year,"" Pollard said. Nicholas Davies, the author of ""William: The Rebel Prince,"" said he thinks William was pressured to come through with the engagement. ""I do believe this came down from the queen and Prince Philip, who is still a very strong character despite his venerable age,"" Davies told CNN. ""They would have said, 'This has gone on long enough. The press knows you're getting married. It's about time you came out and made it known.'"" As for when in 2011 the couple will marry, Clarence House refused to speculate. Bookmakers Paddy Power on Tuesday were offering 3-1 odds on August 13, 2011, being the wedding date, and 4-1 odds on August 6. It said Saturday, July 30, was less likely, at 10-1 odds, because it falls just a day after the 30th anniversary of the wedding of Prince Charles and Lady Diana. The location for the wedding was also being kept secret, though Richard Fitzwilliams, a public relations consultant and royal commentator, told CNN he expects it to happen at Westminster Abbey, probably in July. William and Middleton broke up in April 2007, despite widespread speculation even then that they were close to marriage. The split was said to be amicable, with the couple determined to remain friends, and the two appeared together in the royal box at Wembley Stadium that July for the Concert for Diana, a charity event to remember William's mother 10 years after her death. The pair were seen together several more times that summer and were dating again by the end of the year. Middleton's family is seen as upper-middle class. Such a background bodes well for her future role at the side of the future king, according to Lady Colin Campbell, who wrote a biography of Princess Diana. ""The problem with recent royal brides who were aristocratic is that they thought they were doing the royal family a favor by marrying them,"" she told CNN, ""while the middle-class girls like Sophie Wessex, the countess of Wessex (married to Prince Charles' brother, Edward), and Kate Middleton understand that to be royal requires some sacrifice, and they do not suffer from folie de grandeur [delusion of greatness] the way aristocratic girls evidently do nowadays."" Davies, however, said he feels the opposite about Middleton, who he said lacks the ""charisma"" shown by William's mother. ""Remember that this young lady has no royal connections whatsoever, and that can be a danger,"" he said. Middleton has already met Queen Elizabeth at royal events including the wedding of William's cousin, Peter Phillips, to Autumn Kelly in 2008. ""I think the queen's understood that it's very important for William to make a happy marriage,"" Pollard told CNN. ""He watched his parents be unhappy, and the fact that they [William and Middleton] have stayed together for so long and they have been together for so long rather proves that they get on very well."" CNN's Phil Han in London, England; Dan Rivers in Dorset, England; and Michael Pearson and Arthur Brice in Atlanta, Georgia, contributed to this report.","NEW: Both the ring and Kate are ""special to me,"" the prince says .

"(CNN) -- In a matter of minutes, a way of life disappeared in Hackleburg, Alabama. Three schools. A doctor's office. The pharmacy. A ballfield where children swang for the fences. The Wrangler plant that employed hundreds. A service station. All gone. But the cost from Wednesday's devastating storms was so much dearer. Twenty-nine people in the northwest Alabama town of nearly 1,600 residents died, according to Marion County Sheriff Kevin Williams. Sixteen died at the scene and 13 died at several hospitals, Williams said. ""It's been overwhelming at times,"" he said of the county's ordeal. Another six perished in the county seat of Hamilton, he said, making for a total of 35. Up to 400 people may have been hurt across Marion County, which borders Mississippi and has about 30,000 residents. The state's official update Friday night listed seven people as still missing in Marion County. Total fatalities for all of Alabama was 249. The storms -- which may have included two tornadoes -- roared along U.S. 43 and downtown, destroying almost every business in Hackleburg, officials said Friday. A trailer plant managed to survive, but up to 100 residences were destroyed. ""It's pretty much wiped out,"" Williams said of the city. ""It looks like a war zone."" A bank vault is being used to store medicine, now that the pharmacy is gone. Thirteen people were trapped in the Wrangler plant; one died. ""Everything is gone, and I am not exaggerating,"" said city Police Chief Kenny Hallmark, 40. But, officials said, there were blessings. The superintendent Wednesday decided to send students home. Assistance -- in the form of law enforcement, emergency crews and aid groups -- has poured in. And two members of the city's police department recently received homeland security training in Eufaula, Alabama. About 250 firefighters from the region logged in as volunteers, Williams said. Although there were shelters, townspeople were taking caring of their own, Hallmark told CNN. ""We have a small, close-knit community that takes care of each other, where we don't have to have shelters,"" Hallmark said. ""My house was in direct path and it is still standing,"" although it was damaged, he said. Others were not so fortunate. Most of the dead, Williams said, were found in residences. The incredibly powerful storms lifted a truck and deposited it four miles away, said Hallmark. For now, the city is digging out and trying to reassemble. ""This is people who lived here,"" the chief said.","Thirty-five people killed in Marion County, sheriff says .

"(CNN) -- Wayne Rooney has been visited by police investigating illegal phone-hacking by journalists, the England soccer star revealed on Thursday. ""Scotland Yard detectives came to see me earlier and showed me some documents, looks like a newspaper have (sic) hacked into my phone,"" the Manchester United striker wrote on social networking website Twitter, adding the tag ""#Bigsurprise."" The UK Press Association reported that the paper being investigated is the Sunday tabloid The News of the World, which is owned by Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. PA said Rooney's agent Paul Stretford had also been targeted and was considering legal action. Murdoch paper admits phone hacking as victim rejects payout . The newspaper is already facing many claims from celebrities such as actress Sienna Miller and former Cabinet Minister Tessa Jowell, and three of its journalists have been arrested since the inquiry reopened. The original case saw its royal editor Clive Goodman and private investigator Glenn Mulcaire convicted in 2007, while former editor Andy Coulson quit his job as Prime Minister David Cameron's communications chief three months ago. ""Gonna get my lawyers to deal with phone hacking until end of season. So I can focus on helping MUFC win trophies. Thx for all ur support,"" Rooney added later. His wife Coleen also let her feelings be known on Twitter. ""Newspapers hacking into phones!! Desperate and Disgusting!!!!"" she wrote. The Rooneys have particular reason to be aggrieved with the News of the World, which last September ran stories claiming the footballer slept with a prostitute while his wife was pregnant. The 25-year-old has recently returned to form following a poor start to the season which culminated in him asking to leave United in October -- a move that angered the club's fans but ultimately earned him a lucrative new five-year contract. ""I made a mistake. You know, when I look back at it now, I'll say it again, how wrong was I?"" Rooney told British newspaper The Guardian on Thursday. ""I'm willing to admit that. I've apologized and ever since then I have wanted to try to prove myself again to the fans. I feel I am doing that now."" United end Schalke's perfect home record . Rooney has scored 12 goals in 21 games this year, netting United's second goal in Tuesday's 2-0 win at German club Schalke that put the English Premier League leaders in a strong position to qualify for the May 28 final in London. ""I'm delighted with my form and I'm grateful to the fans for supporting me,"" he said. ""I hope I've repaid the fans now. It's going to be a great end to the season if we can get to Wembley and win a Champions League final as well as the league. ""I am a lot happier in my life, a lot happier with the way I'm playing.

"Casablanca, Morocco (CNN) -- The bombing that ripped through a popular cafe in the Moroccan city of Marrakech apparently was set off at a distance, the state-run news agency said on Friday, citing the nation's interior minister. Maghreb Arabe Presse quoted Taib Cherqaoui as saying that preliminary investigations show that the Thursday assault was conducted by people who remotely detonated the bomb. That development would rule out suspicions of a suicide mission. ""We will investigate this act of terrorism and find those responsible ... and their nationality,"" Cherqaoui told reporters about the attack. ""We condemn it as a criminal act."" Also, a French police team has been sent to Morocco to assist authorities in their probe, the French Foreign Ministry said Friday. Authorities revised the death toll from 16 to 15 in the strike, which also injured nearly two dozen people. In an address on state-run television Thursday, Cherqaoui and King Mohamed VI said the fatalities included six French nationals, five Moroccans, and four others whose nationalities were not divulged. CNN has learned that two of those slain were Russian. The incident occurred around 11 a.m. at Cafe Argana in Marrakech's old city, which is designated by the United Nations cultural arm as a World Heritage Site. Tourists flock to old city in high numbers this time of the year, and it is usually packed with stalls, story-tellers and snake-charmers. World leaders moved quickly to condemn the incident. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon was ""appalled,"" according to a statement from his office. ""He reiterates his firm rejection of the use of indiscriminate violence against innocent civilians and maintains that no political objective justifies or is served by such heinous acts."" U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said the United States ""condemns in the strongest terms (Thursday's) terrorist attack,"" adding, ""Acts of terrorism must not be tolerated wherever and whenever they occur."" And French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe condemned what he called a ""barbarian terrorist attack, which nothing can justify."" Juppe said French authorities will provide assistance to French nationals in Marrakech. A German tourist described a chaotic scene following the blasts. ""We were walking around the souks, right around the corner from Cafe Argana,"" said the tourist, who was about 50 meters from the blast when it occurred. ""We heard a gigantic boom, and everyone immediately starting running towards the square to see what happened."" The woman, who didn't want her name used, told CNN the top floor and terrace of the cafe were ""ripped apart"" by the blast, which caused hundreds of people to run from the area.

"(CNN) -- The chants started from the upper reaches of Radio City Music Hall, but when NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell stepped to the podium to begin the NFL draft on Thursday night, it was clear the fans had more on their minds than the first pick. ""We want football! We want football! We want football!"" Those football fans were speaking for millions across the country, all wondering when their sport will get paroled from the labor impasse that has imprisoned it over the past two months. SI.com: NFL draft round 2 analysis | Round 1 aftermath . Finally, there are signs that might be happening. The NFL announced Thursday, after getting sacked twice in the courts this week, that offseason business resumes today. Weight rooms are open for workouts again. Coaches can hand out playbooks. Players can receive treatment. Read the NFL's statement . ""Football's back,"" union chief DeMaurice Smith declared. Well ... not quite. The NFL and its players still have significant hurdles to clear before reaching an agreement that will finally end the labor dispute that has hovered over the sport for months. And, if an appeals court rules in the NFL's favor, the league could go right back into shutdown mode. But the latest news is potentially a step toward a full, uninterrupted football season. Here is a quick primer on the latest developments: . How did we get to this point? U.S. District Judge Susan Richard Nelson issued a strong rebuke of the owners Monday, ordering an immediate end to the lockout in an 89-page ruling. The league requested the judge to freeze her ruling, and in a decision that surprised no one, she declined. In her ruling, Nelson wrote that continuing the lockout ""is presently inflicting, and will continue to inflict, irreparable harm upon (the players), particularly when weighed against the lack of any real injury that would be imposed on the NFL by issuing the preliminary injunction."" It was the arguably the biggest victory ever for the NFL players, long regarded as the weakest and most often trampled-upon union in professional sports. The owners, who want a bigger slice of the league's $9.3 billion revenue pie, had no choice but to resume business. ""Clubs are free to contact players immediately to advise them of the hours that the facility will be open for their use, to schedule medical and rehabilitation activity, and to arrange meetings with coaches or related activity, such as film study or classroom work,"" the NFL said in its statement. How did the NFL respond? Bitterly. In a letter to The Wall Street Journal, Goodell predicted mass chaos if the players win this fight -- while conveniently ignoring the detail that it was the owners who started it by opting out of their collective bargaining agreement with the players. ""Rather than address the challenge of improving the collective-bargaining agreement for the benefit of the game,"" he wrote, ""the union-financed lawsuit attacks virtually every aspect of the current system including the draft, the salary cap and free-agency rules, which collectively have been responsible for the quality and popularity of the game for nearly two decades."" Read Goodell's letter to The Wall Street Journal . Is all that true? More likely, it's a stance for negotiating . The players are the ones who were comfortable in the current system -- the owners opted out of the current collective bargaining agreement and asked the players to give back $1 billion of their slice of the revenue pie to help finance stadium construction. So where does the case go now? To the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals in St. Louis. The appellate court will rule on the request for a stay, and to prevail, the NFL must show that it will be irreparably harmed if a stay isn't granted. A ruling on the appeal is expected to take at least two months. The onus is now on the owners to prove that the current system harms them -- a hard sell, considering the unprecedented success of professional football and the billion-dollar valuation of the teams. The league's best bet was always to dig in and hope for the players to fracture and cave; now, with legal rulings on their side, the players have more reason than ever to stay united. Remember: Players make the bulk of their salary during the season. Most won't really notice the financial hit until they start missing checks in September. What happens if a stay isn't granted? Get ready for open season. The league would need to immediately put in place interim rules governing free agency, rookie signings and trades. Once it does, the teams would be free to begin signing players, even as the Court of Appeals process continues. The NFL Network's Jason La Canfora reported Thursday that all of that could begin as early as Monday. Philadelphia Eagles fans are most interested in that: Their team is preparing to trade backup quarterback Kevin Kolb. What does this mean for the newly drafted players? They're in the same boat as the current players -- they'll have to wait and see. But unlike the established players, the incoming rookies don't have the same experience with an NFL team. The longer the labor issues drag out, the steeper the learning curve might be for the newcomers. Auburn quarterback Cam Newton, the No. 1 pick of the Carolina Panthers, has a lot to prove. The question is, when will he have the chance to get started? When should fans really start to fear games will be missed? If this drags into late August, start worrying. The NFL left some wiggle room in the schedule, leaving open the possibility that even if no games were played in the first three weeks of the season, all 16 games could still be played.

"(CNN) -- Inter Milan did all they could to keep the pressure up on Serie A leaders AC Milan as they beat lowly Cesena 2-1. But they left it very late. Two goals in injury time by striker Giampaolo Pazzini ensured Inter stay in touch with their city rivals, closing the gap to five points until Sunday at least, when Milan host mid-table Bologna. Cesena took the lead after 56 minutes thanks to Croatian striker Igor Budan and, as the finals minutes ticked down, looked to have claimed three vital points. But then Inter's unlikely comeback started with Samuel Eto'o delivering an inswinging cross into the box which Pazzini managed to poke home on the volley. Seconds later the Italian striker found himself in the right place at the right time again as he rose to meet Maicon's cross from the right to head home to complete a dramatic and bizarre turnaround. ""It was all calculated, it was organized from the first minute, everything went perfectly,"" Inter coach, Leonardo joked afterwards, AFP reported. ""We looked at it as a decisive game and it was very important to get the three points for the Champions League, even if qualification isn't yet secured. Winning in this way really is incredible even if it's not our first comeback,"" he added, AFP reported. The loss leaves Cesena in 16th place, although both Sampdoria (who face Brescia) and Lecce (who travel to Chievo) can both overtake them if they win on Sunday. In Saturday's other game third-placed Napoli kept up the pressure on Inter with a 1-0 win over Genoa -- Slovak midfielder Marek Hamsik with the goal seven minutes before the final whistle. The result means Napoli remain a point behind Inter in the table whilst extending their lead over fourth-placed Lazio who host Juventus on Monday evening.","Inter Milan beat Cesena 2-1 with two goals in injury time .

"(Rolling Stone) -- Stevie Nicks built her legend on the California-Babylon chronicles she perfected in the Seventies with Fleetwood Mac, and in the Eighties on underrated solo gems like ""The Other Side of the Mirror."" But she still has that eternal edge-of-17 tremor in her voice. The gypsy queen is in royal form on ""In Your Dreams"" -- it's not just her first album in 10 years, it's her finest collection of songs since the Eighties. ""In Your Dreams"" has the high-gloss L.A. production of her collaborators, Glen Ballard and Eurythmics' Dave Stewart. But the material is Nicks in platform-soled hyper-romantic mode, with her voice in surprisingly supple shape. ""Secret Love"" is an oldie she wrote in 1976 -- who knew she was still keeping secrets from her ""Rumours"" days? It seems to be about one of her rock-star beaus, although she coyly maintains she can't remember which one. Yet it isn't even one of the better tracks on ""In Your Dreams."" The over-the-top seduction ballad ""Italian Summer"" could be her answer to the Stones' ""Wild Horses."" It climaxes in a very Stevie credo: ""Love was everywhere/You just had to fall."" Nicks finds storytelling inspiration everywhere, from the Twilight series (""Moonlight [A Vampire's Dream]"") to Jean Rhys (""Wide Sargasso Sea""). But the real showstopper here is the Edgar Allan Poe tribute ""Annabel Lee,"" a fan fave that's been kicking around on bootlegs since the Nineties. It's a six-minute meditation on love and death with echoes of the Fleetwood Mac classic ""Dreams."" Poe's key line -- ""The moon never beams without bringing me dreams""  -- might have been written in 1849, but it was clearly meant for Stevie Nicks to sing. Rolling Stone rating: 3 1/2 stars .

"(CNN) -- Authorities plan to launch probes into rioting and vandalism in Oman, where protesters recently have staged anti-government demonstrations, the Gulf state's news agency reported Saturday. Oman's public prosecutors cited the setting of fires, damaging public and private property, blocking roads and impeding traffic flow in the city of Sohar and other locations. It said it will ""initiate investigations against those who incited and carried out such acts. ""All these acts are against the laws, the tenets of the Islamic Sharia and the morals of the Omani society are known for,"" the prosecutors said in a statement reported by the Oman News Agency.

There have been reports of attacks on property and sources said demonstrators in Sohar have blocked routes to the port and the industrial zone, prompting port staff to leave work. Protesters' demands include greater freedom of expression, higher salaries, a clampdown on government corruption, a new constitution, and the prosecution of security officials whose actions led to the death of demonstrators. Oman's sultanate is making changes on the heels of the Sohar protests. The news agency said Saturday that Sultan Waboos bin Said replaced three high-level government figures.

"(CNN) -- Honduran teachers who have been on strike for 21 days faced a decision Monday morning: return to the classroom or endure punishments. The government on Sunday issued an ultimatum, disseminated on radio and television, to the teachers, saying that if they did not show up for work Monday, they would be suspended for two months without pay. Those who do not show up by Wednesday, will be handed six-month suspensions, and those still striking by next week will not allowed to teach for a year, the government said. ""If these deadlines are not met, the government will begin to execute justified firings,"" the statement said.

"(CNN) -- David Villa has become the top scorer in Spanish international history after netting both goals as the world and European champions fought back from going a goal behind to beat the Czech Republic 2-1 in Euro 2012 Group I on Friday. Barcelona striker Villa netted twice in five second half minutes in Granada to take his tally for his country to 46 goals in just 72 appearances. The 29-year-old had come into the match level with Raul on 44 goals, but the Real Madrid legend played in 102 matches to achieve his total. The match also saw Villa's Barca teammate Xavi Hernandez win his 100th cap for his country, becoming only the fourth Spaniard to achieve that feat after Raul, Andoni Zubizarreta and Iker Casillas. In amongst all the record breaking, the visiting Czechs threatened to cause an upset when taking a first half lead through Jaroslav Plasil's speculative long-range strike. But Villa levelled in the 69th minute after being put through by Andres Iniesta and he secured Spain's win from the penalty spot four minutes later after Iniesta had been fouled by Jan Rezek. The victory was Spain's 10th in a row in competitive matches following their loss to Switzerland in their opening World Cup finals match in South Africa.

"(CNN) -- Reigning world champion Sebastian Vettel started his 2011 Formula One defense in emphatic style on Sunday, leading the season-opening Australian Grand Prix in Melbourne from start to finish. McLaren's 2008 world champion Lewis Hamilton did well to finish second after damaging his car on the first corner while Lotus Renault's Russian driver Vitaly Petrov achieved his first podium finish. The 23-year-old German notched up his 11th win in his 63rd Formula 1 race. Fernando Alonso finished fourth for Ferrari, with Mark Webber in his Red Bull in fifth place. Jenson Button came sixth in his McLaren. Red Bull team boss Christian Horner said after the race his team did not use its KERS power-boost system because of technical issues, underlining the scale of Vettel's victory. Following his triumph, Vettel said: ""It was a good race. In the end things calmed down, Lewis didn't push, but it was not an easy race. ""The start was crucial, I was on the clean side, but didn't know if it was enough until we got through the first corner.

"Washington (CNN) -- The Obama administration says that Pakistan was not involved or given advance warning about the operation that killed Osama bin Laden, but top U.S. officials said the al Qaeda leader never would have been found and killed without the counterterrorism cooperation between the two countries over the past few years. ""Pakistan has contributed greatly to our efforts to dismantle al Qaeda. And in fact, cooperation with Pakistan helped lead U.S. to bin Laden and the compound in which he was hiding,"" Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said. ""We're committed to this partnership. We think it is in the best interest of the security and safety of the United States."" Officials maintain that the relationship with Islamabad is complicated, fraught with difficulties and mistrust, but the fact that Pakistan has allowed the U.S. counterterrorism operative to operate on its soil, albeit with only a tacit endorsement, is critical to the type of operations that led to finding bin Laden. ""The relationship is complicated and their cooperation is mixed at best and going forward it's going to be bumpy, but there is no way to do this sort of thing without this partnership,"" one senior official said. ""The idea that this would have happened if they wouldn't have let our guys in the country is not possible."" Officials said they do believe that while a few members of the Pakistani intelligence service ISI might have known about bin Laden's location, they don't think it was broadly known that he was there. But they acknowledge that Pakistan does have some explaining to do about how bin Laden was hiding in plain sight just miles from the country's main military academy for close to a year. The U.S. never told Pakistan about its suspicions that bin Laden was hiding out at the compound, officials said. ""Pakistan has never been and never will be the hotbed of fanaticism that is often described by the media,"" Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari wrote in a Washington Post column Monday. ""And for me, justice against bin Laden was not just political; it was also personal, as the terrorists murdered our greatest leader, the mother of my children. ""Some in the U.S. press have suggested that Pakistan lacked vitality in its pursuit of terrorism, or worse yet that we were disingenuous and actually protected the terrorists we claimed to be pursuing. Such baseless speculation may make exciting cable news, but it doesn't reflect fact."" Husain Haqqani, Pakistan's ambassador to the United States, insisted his government had no knowledge of bin Laden's whereabouts at any point over the last several years. He didn't rule out the possibility that some in Pakistan who were sympathetic to bin Laden's views provided him sanctuary. ""Pakistan is a nation of 180 million. There are people in Pakistan, unfortunately, who have sympathies with Osama bin Laden and obviously some of them had protected for him while he was there,"" he said. ""If we had really known where bin Laden was, we would have got him."" Despite being left in the dark, the Pakistani envoy spoke positively about the bin Laden mission. ""They had superior intelligence, they had superior technology, and we are grateful to them and to God for having given us this opportunity to bring this chapter to an end,"" Haqqani told CNN. In addition to President Barack Obama's phone call with Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari, administration officials will continue to engage the government ""as we learn more about the compound and whatever type of support system bin Laden had,"" White House counterterrorism advisor John Brennan told reporters Monday. The hope, officials said, is that the attack will inspire the Pakistani government to cooperate more fully with the United States. Several officials predict Pakistan will go through a period of soul-searching about the fact bin Laden was hiding in their country in plain sight as well as the fact the U.S. killed him on their soil. ""The top four al Qaeda leaders were killed or captured in Pakistan; it's ridiculous to say this is not their problem,"" a second U.S. official said. ""And any claims that we violated their sovereignty won't resonate because the target on the other end was Osama bin Laden."" Anthony Cordesman of the Center for Strategic and International Studies said Pakistan's initial reaction to the news suggested reason for cautious optimism about the relationship going forward. ""They didn't attack us for entering Pakistan. They didn't condemn us for being in Pakistan. Those are positive signs,"" he said. But he added, ""They don't tell us, however, what's happening in the Pakistani military or ISI or the people who in the past have supported the Taliban or tolerated al Qaeda."" Officials said the U.S. is going to be treating Pakistan gingerly over the next few days as they weigh how the attack will affect the relationship. Marc Grossman, special representative for Afghanistan/Pakistan, is in Islamabad on Monday for talks with Pakistani officials. ""We still need Pakistan's cooperation, and we need to see how we can move forward,"" the second official said. ""We need to give them some credit for what they have done, which did lead to this day. We can't focus excessively on the negative."" Brennan pointed out that despite the ""differences of view"" between the U.S. and Pakistan on counterterrorism cooperation, Pakistan has been responsible for killing and capturing more terrorists on its soil than any other country ""by a wide margin."" ""There have been many, many brave Pakistani soldiers, security officials, as well as citizens, who have given their lives because of the terrorism scourge in that country,"" Brennan said, calling the partnership with Pakistan ""critically important to breaking the back of al Qaeda and eventually prevailing over al Qaeda as well as associated terrorist groups."" But Seth Jones of the RAND Corp. warns that bin Laden's death does not resolve the big-ticket issues between Washington and Islamabad, namely Pakistan's support for the Taliban and other insurgent groups battling U.S. forces in Afghanistan, such as the Haqqani network. ""As long as many of those issues continue to exist, and they have very different interests, and they have very different strategic goals in the area, then some level of conflict will likely persist,"" Jones said. Officials said they hope the U.S. can get Pakistan on board to support a political process in Afghanistan with reconciliation between the Taliban and the Afghan government -- and they believe bin Laden's death presents an opportunity for progress. Officials do believe that al Qaeda in Pakistan has suffered a huge disruption, having lost a charasmatic leader such as bin Laden. But they also are bracing for members of al Qaeda to avenge his death and believe the United States will see a period of increased threat, where attacks will likely be planned against U.S. interests.","Some in U.S. hope for more cooperation with Pakistan .

"(CNN) -- With the official state death toll now at 337, the Wednesday through Thursday tornado outbreak is the second-deadliest single day for tornadoes since recordkeeping began, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said. The outbreak is also on record as creating the most number of tornadoes in a single day. Records go back to 1680. Since then, there has been only one other date in U.S. history on which more people died during a severe weather outbreak, according to the National Weather Service. Weather officials say the reason why so many perished was due to the size and path of the tornadoes. Meteorologists rely on what is called an ""Enhanced Fujita Scale"" to rate the severity of tornadoes. The lowest ranking, EF0, applies to twisters with recorded 3-second wind gusts of 65 to 85 mph, according to the National Weather Service. The highest, an EF5, is assigned to tornadoes with speeds of more than 200 mph. The weather service has so far recorded 11 tornadoes with EF3 ratings or higher that struck central and north Alabama on Wednesday. Some of the twisters were three-quarters of a mile wide and traveled dozens of miles, experts said. ""That's an astounding amount for a single-day tornado event."" said Krissy Scotten, a weather service meteorologist in Birmingham, Alabama. ""It's one of those instances where you had very large tornadoes on very long tracks hitting heavily populated areas."" ""When you put that together, you're going to see large loss of life and massive devastation,"" Scotten said. According to the National Weather Service: . FATALITIES . -- The deadliest single day for tornadoes was on March 18, 1925, with 747 fatalities across seven states. -- As of Saturday morning, the Wednesday-Thursday outbreak has seen 337 fatalities across six states. -- The third-deadliest tornado outbreak was on March 21, 1932, when 332 people died. SEVERITY . --  An EF4 tornado that struck Pleasant Grove, Alabama, was produced by an astounding supercell thunderstorm that began in Newton County, Mississippi, and dissipated in Macon County, North Carolina. That supercell lasted 7 hours and 24 minutes and covered 380 miles, producing several strong to violent tornadoes along the way. -- The agency estimates that on Wednesday-Thursday, there were 211 tornadoes. -- The largest previous number of tornadoes on record in one event took place from April 3-4, 1974, with 148 tornadoes.

"Barcelona, Spain (CNN) -- World champion Jorge Lorenzo has told CNN that he has a difficult relationship with his former teammate, motorcycling legend Valentino Rossi. The Spaniard usurped the seven-time MotoGP titleholder last season, setting records for most wins and points scored as Rossi struggled to recover after a series of injuries. The 23-year-old Lorenzo accused Rossi, now 32, of dangerous riding in Japan last October before clinching his maiden crown in Malaysia in the following race. The Italian subsequently ended his seven-year stint at Yamaha, where he and Lorenzo had been awkward stablemates since 2008, and joined Ducati. ""I think it was a problem of character,"" Lorenzo told CNN World Sport's Pedro Pinto in an exclusive interview in Barcelona. ""We had a very tough character, really strong. We just didn't ... have a feeling. ""Look, I don't have any personal problems with the riders I'm competing with. I believe you can be friends with a rider while you are fighting for the championship. I don't have any friends, but I believe in it!"" Despite their problems, Lorenzo said he did not expect Rossi to join Ducati, replacing Casey Stoner -- who moved to the Italian's first team Honda. Ducati have been off the pace since Stoner won his and the team's first and only world title in 2007. ""I was a bit surprised, because it's a big challenge for him, but I also would think if I was in his position, it could be a really interesting challenge, no?"" Lorenzo said. ""Because Ducati being an Italian brand ... it's really difficult, but for them it's a nice idea."" The Mallorcan became only the second Spaniard to win the world title in motorcycling's elite class, but admits he was a little underwhelmed at the time. ""This happens always in life. When you like a girl, you have obsession for the girl, you want to be with this girl and when you finally are with this girl, you think 'That is it? Not anything more?' ""With the world title, it's the same. You imagine, you dream a lot about this; when it happens, then you think, 'It's only this?' But then, after a few hours, when you are more calm, when you are alone, with your friends, with the people who are more close to you, then you start to realize how important the thing you got is."" Stoner strikes first blow of 2011 MotoGP season . Lorenzo was named Spain's sportsman of the year and later met King Juan Carlos, but is still coming to terms with his newfound celebrity status. ""When I wasn't famous, I wanted to achieve that because it's cool, no? But when it happens, every time you go to a restaurant you have to stop your meal to take a picture. When you are going to a discotheque it's impossible to dance, it's impossible to be with your friends because every meter you walk you have to take a picture!"" Lorenzo goes into this weekend's Spanish Grand Prix having finished second behind Stoner at the season-opening race in Qatar, but said he feels no pressure to emulate last year's achievements. ""I really don't think about this. I have this new adhesive on the front of the bike -- this number one. I'm proud of it but I don't think I am number one forever or that I can't lose,"" he said. ""I don't have more points than anyone else in the category from the beginning and I guess I can lose the championship. The other riders can beat me if I don't work hard or if I have an inferior bike."" Lorenzo started riding at the age of three when his father, himself a former racer, built him his first bike. ""I have always had this necessity to win. When I played with my friends on the street, football or running, I always wanted to be the best,"" he said. ""I competed in everything in Mallorca, all the championships, and I won a lot. You dream about getting into the world championship someday, to be professional, but it's a very long way and you don't know if this is going to happen or not.""","Jorge Lorenzo says he and Valentino Rossi had ""a problem of character"" at Yamaha .

"(Health.com)  -- Miranda Lambert may have forgotten to thank her fiancé, fellow country music star Blake Shelton, when she won her first Grammy this February. But when we caught up with the 27-year-old star on her tour, Blake was top of mind. In fact, the Texas native was thrilled to chat about everything, from her energy secrets to how she's getting into peak shape to swap ""I do's"" with Blake this month. Q: You're in Evansville, Indiana, now. Do you ever get confused about which city you're in? A: Yes! They usually write where we are on the set list, because I've made the mistake of saying the wrong state before. I was like, ""Hello, Ohio!"" And they just kind of looked at me like my head was on fire. [Laughs.] . Q: And how do you keep your energy up on stage? A: I eat a lot of protein and eat pretty clean. Junk food drags you down.

We do a lot of circuit training, lunges, and crunches. And every morning we walk for 30 minutes. Q: Your parents were private eyes who ran an agency from home. It sounds like a TV show! A: It does. But to us [back then], it was just my parents' job. I did surveillance a lot, which sounds exciting, but it never was. If there was no babysitter, I'd have to go, and my brother and I would just lie in the backseat and color for 15 hours while my mom watched the house. Q: Did you know what your parents were doing, exactly? A: In a way, I had such a normal life. But in another way, I saw things most kids don't see. Our dinner conversations weren't about school and homework; they were about child custody cases or divorce. When I was a teenager, my parents took in victims of domestic abuse, which was definitely eye-opening. I had to share my room with a woman and her kids who had been abused.

We raised rabbits and chickens, and also had our own hogs that we slaughtered. We didn't really go to the store for anything besides milk. My mom would say, ""Go pick out what you want for dinner,"" and we'd go in the garden and get whatever vegetables we wanted. It was really old-school and really awesome. Q: Was it hard slaughtering animals that were your pets? A: Dad would give us two rabbits as our pets, or we'd have one pig we could name. They explained that not every animal was a pet -- some were providing for our family. It sounds weird to other people, but I look at it like, there are some animals you feed and some animals that feed you. Q: Are you a good cook? A: [Blake and I are] both pretty good. We have a lot of catfish, and everybody knows the best way to eat catfish is fried. I tried to be healthy and bake it once, which was horrible. We ordered a pizza! Health.com: 13 easy pizza recipes . Q: How did you know that Blake was the one? A: The first day I met him, I knew he was really special. We balance each other out. He's constantly joking, and I'm more serious. He can make me laugh at any point. Especially when I'm trying to be mad, he'll go, ""Are we in a fight?"" And then I'll start laughing and go, ""I guess not now."" Q: He must understand the pressure of being in the public eye. It's not enough anymore to just be a singer -- you have to look great, too. Is that tough? A: Absolutely. The bigger you get, the more pressure you have to deal with. The hard part is I'm a normal-size girl, and I'm fine with that. All these stars are so tiny, and they spend their lives trying to be skinny. I want to look my best, but I'm not a model. I'm not an actress. I'm representing normal girls.

"(CNN) -- ""Mortal Kombat"" reboots the origins of the classic video game with a time-travel story, awesome new moves and (for the first time) the ability for tag-team action. The latest version in the iconic series from NetherRealm Studios and Warner Bros. Entertainment returns to the game's roots with fast action, brutal results and a story mode that takes players back to the first three ""Mortal Kombat"" games in an effort to change the future. Fatalities make a return, as well as a new move called X-ray. The controls are deceptively simple. Each button on the controller works a particular body part -- one button for left arm, one button for right leg, and so on. Using the D-pad or an analog stick in conjunction with the button makes the character perform more complicated maneuvers. And, as in the past, stringing together a series of buttons and stick movements creates highly specialized and devastating attacks. However, the game can work just as well with basic moves, for beginners, as it does with more detailed ones, for experienced players. While the characters and background stories are rendered in three dimensions, fights take place on a two-dimensional plane. The details in the movements and battle effects are highly rendered and, in the sprit of the franchise's past, graphic. Nowhere is this more evident than in the new X-ray attack. A bar at the bottom of the screen fills up as moves are used. Once completely full, the X-ray move can be used. Cinematics are shown as a character performs a devastating series of attacks that demonstrate in gory and specific detail what bones are being broken or which internal organs are being destroyed. The imagery is gruesome and groan-worthy, but it won't let you avert your eyes, and fatalities are also more detailed and violent than in past versions. So these moves are not for the faint of heart or stomach. More than once during my game play, others watching moaned or yelled ""Gross!"" (Which, it must be said, made me want to perform those actions again and again). There are also fatality moves that use the surrounding environment's scenery to deadly effect. Fan-favorite characters are back, including Liu Kang, Scorpion, Kitana and Sonya Blade. Other playable, never-before-seen characters get unlocked during game play. The single-player story is cheesy, but it gets you into the action quickly and requires you to use a variety of characters. At each stage, the player controls a different avatar through a series of fights to advance to the next stage. Combat difficulty ramps up as you advance, but during some battles, the difficulty seems to be extraordinarily high. Specific tactics seem to be needed to get through those particular fights -- for example, counterpunching only or flying attacks only. In the story, Lord Raiden sends a message back in time to himself to prevent Shao Kahn's ultimate victory (the story told in ""Mortal Kombat: Armageddon""). It plays out like ... well ... a movie, but offers an excuse for the ensuing battles and tournaments to take place. Single-player action is expected to last more than eight hours. It took me about 10 hours to complete, including the climactic boss battle, which ended up being fairly easy once I figured out a particular series of moves to win. Other modes of play offer fight training, skill tests and tutorials that allow you to practice fatality moves over and over. The Challenge Tower consists of fights and mini-games that test your skills and hone your moves. There are also special modes that randomly change the fight rules, hand out rewards for breaking items, check your eyesight with a hidden ball game and test timing with a fast-strike game. With 300 different challenges, this mode will keep you busy for quite some time. The new Tag Team feature lets up to 4 gamers play in a tournament or single competition. The tag element allows for combo attacks in which one character can set up a devastating finale with the other. Once that sequence begins, the opponent offers no resistance, so there is no pressure, which allows players the time to perfect the awesome maneuver. Plus, it is just fun to see how combatants are dismembered. There are also battle modes for online action, including ladder challenges and tournaments. Sadly, because of the PlayStation Network outage, I was unable to check those out. ""Mortal Kombat"" is a triumphant return to the roots of the classic fighting game. Despite story line dialog that is more in line with a B-movie, the single-player action does move along at a brisk pace and offers great variety in characters and action. If you've never played a ""Mortal Kombat"" game before, this is a good way to get a handle on the characters. But if you are a longtime fan of the series, you will be impressed with the improved graphics, original content and battle challenges. It is a worthy addition to the series. ""Mortal Kombat"" is available now for the PlayStation 3 and the Xbox 360. It is rated M for mature because of blood and gore, intense violence, partial nudity and strong language. The PS3 version also contains Kratos from the ""God of War"" series as a playable character, and the game can also be played in stereoscopic 3-D.","From NetherRealm Studios and Warner Bros.

"Smithville, Mississippi (CNN) -- Top federal officials voiced admiration and vowed cooperation Sunday after touring tornado-ravaged areas in Alabama and Mississippi, promising help to those who made it through this week's storms as they reconstruct their lives and communities. ""They're going to have to live and rebuild and recover,"" Craig Fugate, the head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, said in Birmingham. ""Give them the respect that they're a survivor, not a victim."" Fugate was joined by several members of President Barack Obama's Cabinet, including heads of the departments of homeland security, agriculture, and housing and urban development. They saw destruction in Birmingham, then headed west to Smithville, Mississippi, where 15 of the town's less than 900 people perished due to the powerful twister. See photos of the devastation . Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano explained that the group was diverse in order to best leverage the potential of the federal government, as it worked to help states, municipalities and ultimately individuals. She vowed that this effort will involve short-term fixes and a long-term committment in Alabama, Mississippi, Tennessee and other states hit the hardest. ""We will work (the affected) states as well, and those communities as well, to help them recover from this spring of storms -- and to come back strongly,"" Napolitano said. About 148 devastating twisters Wednesday left a wide swath of death and destruction across 13 states. The death toll had climbed to 339 Sunday, according to emergency management officials in six of those states. On Sunday, some of those killed were laid to rest while others attended religious services, hoping to make sense of the calamity. iReport pictures from Tuscaloosa area . A tornado demolished the Smithville Baptist Church in Mississippi. On Sunday, the church's pastor Wes White urged several hundred congregants gathered under a tent not to lose hope, but to turn to Jesus, in the days and weeks to come. ""We were changed. Our world will never be the same. This moment will forever be etched in the forefront of all our imaginations,"" White said. Hours later, the small town played host to Napolitano, Fugate and other members of the Obama administration. They noted that, despite the massive destruction, only 22 people are in shelters because most of those impacted were taken in by relatives, neighbors and fellow church members. This fact showed the strong community in Smithville and vicinity, but did not diminish the tremendous suffering and long-term challenges ahead, the officials said. Surgeon: 'I was just in shock' ""When the Piggly Wiggly is not open, it's real bad, folks,"" Fugate said. ""It don't get much worse ... This is going to be a tough recovery, but you are survivors. That's why we're here."" The administration officials said assistance will be offered -- and red tape circumvented -- to help with everything from patching roofs to aiding the local timber industry to rebuilding businesses. They urged those affected to phone FEMA at 1-800-621-3362 to get registered and learn about the process. In many communities, the struggle is daunting. Throughout Alabama -- the hardest-hit state -- the death toll Sunday morning was 250 and the number of injured was 2,219, emergency management officials said. Nearly a half million customers in the state remained without power. Tuscaloosa Mayor Walter Maddox said his city, where at least 39 people have died, faces a ""humanitarian crisis."" Hundreds of people remain unaccounted for and many more have been rendered homeless, he said. Horror and hope in Tuscaloosa . Rescuers and volunteers have descended on the area from near and far, canvassing neighborhoods looking for the missing and offering help to those who are staying near their devastated homes. ""We all got together and we wanted to help,"" Lorinda Rodriguez-Mitchell told CNN on Sunday from near Tuscaloosa, where she was coordinating the collection and distribution of items like diapers, cereal and water. ""We're just going down there to deliver food. Some people have been there 40, 50 years and they're not leaving."" In the Hispanic community, volunteer Martin Izaguirre said, many are afraid to go to shelters. He said some have told him, ""We are afraid we won't be welcomed in places where Spanish is not spoken."" While searchers fan out, some have taken a more high-tech approach. The University of Alabama's Crimson White student newspaper is trying to track down some of Tuscaloosa's missing using the #UAMissing hashtag on Twitter, said Hannah Mask, a former editor who has been working on the project. Hispanics struggle after storm . ""It's been really efficient,"" she said, noting that the list of those unaccounted for seems to be decreasing. Damage to larger Alabama cities such as Birmingham and Tuscaloosa may have been greater than the damage suffered by smaller towns, but rural areas will likely have a harder time recovering, Red Cross spokeswoman Anita Foster said. ""In terms of suffering, these people have lost their loved ones, they've lost their community. There are people who don't have home to return to,"" Foster said. She noted the sad response she received from one Hackleburg, Alabama, resident after asking her whether the town could recover. The woman simply shook her head, Foster said. CNN's Rob Marciano, Martin Savidge, Raja Razek and Gustavo Valdes contributed to this report.","NEW: Several members of Barack Obama's Cabinet tour Mississippi and Alabama .

"(CNN)  -- Aaron Ramsey scored the only goal of the match in the second half as Arsenal beat leaders Manchester United at the Emirates Sunday to blow the English title race wide open. A win for United would have all but sealed a record 19th championship, but they now lead Chelsea by just three points and Arsenal by six. The top two play effectively a title decider at Old Trafford next weekend, with Arsenal waiting to pounce if either falters. ""In terms of ability -- a game at Old Trafford, the supporters will be ready for it -- and so will our players,"" defiant United manager Alex Ferguson told Sky Sports. Ferguson's team, who have a poor record against the top six this season, particularly away from home where they have failed to win, fell victim to a 56th minute strike from young Welshman Ramsey. Arsenal might have had a penalty in the first half when Nemanja Vidic appeared to use his hand to deflect Theo Walcott's cross away from Robin van Persie as the Dutchman prepared to head towards goal, but referee Chris Foy ignored their claims. United's Wayne Rooney went close with a curling free-kick that Wojciech Szczesny saved superbly after the break before Ramsey scored his first Gunners goal since January 2010. He was set up by Van Persie who cut the ball back for him to beat Edwin van der Sar. Nani went close for United and Michael Owen had a penalty appeal turned down, but Arsenal deservedly held on for their first victory over United since November 2008. Sunday's late kick off saw Manchester City consolidate fourth place with a 2-1 win over bottom side West Ham at Eastlands. City are now seven points clear of Liverpool and Tottenham as they try to claim the final Champions League qualifying position. Nigel de Jong and a Lars Jacobsen own goal gave City a 2-0 lead after 15 minutes. But Demba Ba pulled one back in the 33rd minute and the home side had to endure some nervous moments before sealing the three points. Earlier Sunday, Liverpool moved over Tottenham into fifth place on goal difference with a 3-0 win over Newcastle at Anfield. Maxi Rodriguez opened the scoring in the 10th minute when his shot deflected in off Danny Simpson. Dirk Kuyt scored the second in the 59th minute after Luis Suarez was fouled by Mike Williamson. Uruguay star Suarez added the third himself six minutes later to seal three valuable points. At St Andrew's, 10-man Birmingham boosted their survival bid by holding on for a 1-1 draw against fellow strugglers Wolves.","Arsenal beat Manchester United 1-0 to open up EPL title race .

"(CNN Student News) -- May 2, 2011 . Download PDF maps related to today's show: . • Libya • Vatican City • Alabama . Transcript . THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED. GROUP OF STUDENTS FROM BUSINESS, ENGINEERING, SCIENCE, AND TECHNOLOGY (B.E.S.T.) ACADEMY: Welcome to CNN Student News at B.E.S.T. Academy Middle School. UNIDENTIFIED MALE B.E.S.T. STUDENT: Today, we are very glad and appreciative of the teachers who are striving to make us the best and prepare us for a promising and productive future. GROUP: And remember, we are accepting no excuses in our journey to be the B.E.S.T. CARL AZUZ, CNN STUDENT NEWS ANCHOR: Thanks to the students at B.E.S.T. Academy for getting things started today as CNN Student News kicks off Teacher Appreciation Week. I'm Carl Azuz. Let's get to it. First Up: Libya Civil War . AZUZ: First up, the Libyan military is increasing its attacks on rebel forces, and at least one witness says it's ""like revenge."" This comes after a NATO airstrike reportedly killed part of Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi's family. Gadhafi has controlled Libya for 42 years. Rebels want him out of power; they're fighting against his government and military. NATO, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, is leading an international operation to protect Libya's citizens. Libyan authorities say one of Colonel Gadhafi's sons and three of his grandchildren were killed in Sunday's airstrike. Government officials say Moammar Gadhafi and his wife were in the house when it was targeted, but that they're all right. NATO says it doesn't target individuals, just military-related locations. NATO commanders added that they regret any loss of life during Libya's ongoing civil war. Pope Beatification . AZUZ: The late Pope John Paul II can now be called ""blessed,"" which means he's one step away from becoming a saint. The pope -- the position -- serves as the head of the Roman Catholic Church. And John Paul II served as pope from 1978 until his death in 2005. In the Catholic faith, in order to be beatified -- that's when you're declared as ""blessed"" -- a person has to be credited with performing a miracle. Becoming a saint requires two miracles. Some people have been critical of how John Paul II handled some issues in the Catholic Church while he was pope. But more than a million people came out to the Vatican on Sunday for the beatification ceremony led by the current pope, Benedict XVI. John Paul performed more than 1,300 beatification ceremonies while he was pope, a very popular pope to this day. Royal Wedding . AZUZ: Their names are still William and Kate, but from now on, you can call them the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge. Those are the titles that Britain's Prince William and Catherine Middleton were given after their royal wedding last Friday. It was not what you'd call a small ceremony. The couple tied the knot at Westminster Abbey in front of family and friends. But people around the world tuned in to watch, and huge crowds showed up in London for a chance to see the bride and groom. They will be going on a honeymoon, although they aren't saying where. But they're not leaving for a while. After a quiet weekend, Prince William was headed back to his job as a search and rescue pilot. Sound Check . WALTER MADDOX, MAYOR OF TUSCALOOSA, ALABAMA: My heart's broken. There's no way you can walk on these streets where I have grown up, and the 93,000 citizens that I represent, and see the pain in their eyes, the look of what has happened to us. This has clearly been a dark hour for me personally, and for our city. But I am confident. I believe that we will come out of this stronger, and a new day will dawn for the city of Tuscaloosa. Alabama Aftermath . AZUZ: The mayor of Tuscaloosa, Alabama. His city was hit hard by severe weather and tornadoes that whipped across the southern U.S. last week. Churches across the state of Alabama held a day of prayer yesterday for the victims and survivors. Authorities say more than 330 people were killed across six states; that made it the second deadliest tornado outbreak in U.S. history. President Obama went to see some of the damage in Tuscaloosa on Friday. He declared major disasters in parts of Alabama, Mississippi and Georgia. That declaration will give money to help with the recovery efforts. Weather anchor Reynolds Wolf was also in Tuscaloosa. He gives us a closer look at what the president saw. (BEGIN VIDEO) REYNOLDS WOLF, CNN WEATHER ANCHOR: This is Alabama. It's my home state, the heart of Dixie, and after suffering the worst tornado in its history, this place will never quite be the same. When it comes to damage, it's so incredibly random. One house will have a wall completely ripped away, part of a roof. This one, on the other side of these trees, was actually lifted up and pushed completely off its foundation. And then right across the street on this side there's nothing there. Unreal. Now, before the twisters struck, this truck was in perfect condition. But after experiencing winds, possibly as high as 300 miles per hour, this vehicle has been reduced to rubble. And since this story began, we've been down countless streets, been in many neighborhoods, and still, we're seeing the same stuff. Near and far, there's just destruction. From houses to trees, just devastation. Here in Tuscaloosa though, things are slowly getting back to normal. You look across McFarland Boulevard and you see some construction crews trying to put things back together. All around them, plenty of damage. But things like that can get fixed. For the people who lost loved ones, though, life will never be the same. (END VIDEO) Shuttle Launch Delay . AZUZ: This is not where Endeavour is supposed to be right now. The shuttle was supposed to launch last Friday. NASA called that off because of concerns about the heating system. Next possibility was today, but that's off too. A power problem is what's causing the other delay. The Endeavour crew and support staff were allowed to go home. Officials haven't set a new launch date, but they say it won't be any earlier than next Sunday, May 8th. Shoutout .

That's your answer and that's your Shoutout! Career Connections . AZUZ: We're putting the Steadicam in focus today because our Career Connections segment is back! Our own Tomeka Jones is here to give you the scoop. Tomeka? TOMEKA JONES, CNN STUDENT NEWS: Well, the title pretty much speaks for itself! We're trying to help you connect with careers that interest you. Carl, what gave you the desire to become an anchor? AZUZ: Uh, I was a better talker than listener. JONES: Well, CNN's Matt Lingerfelt knew he wanted to be a professional cameraman from the time he was young, like middle-high school age. He learned a lot from the work of Garrett Brown, who invented the Steadicam in the 1970s. And now, he's following in Brown's footsteps. (BEGIN VIDEO) MATT LINGERFELT, CNN STEADICAM OPERATOR: A good operator makes Steadicam look good. RANDI KAYE, CNN ANCHOR: The breakdown is a monumental shutdown. LINGERFELT: Steadicam was originally designed for film. Basically, it's a vest that has an arm that comes around. And I attach this arm that has springs loaded into it. The camera attaches to it. The springs take out all the load of the camera and me walking around, so it balances it out; makes it nice and smooth. We have two minutes until we are live. Right now, we're in the middle of a break and I'm getting time cues in my ear from master control. UNIDENTIFIED CNN DIRECTOR: Her mic. Go Matt. Cue. FIONNUALA SWEENEY, CNN INTERNATIONAL ANCHOR: You are at the international desk, where we bring you the world up to the minute. UNIDENTIFIED CNN DIRECTOR: Go Matt. Roll them. LINGERFELT: So, the director is telling me, ""Matt, I need this shot."" And then he'll explain whatever shot it is, either the anchor at a wall or I'm doing a bump shot. And all a bump shot is is just a beauty shot of the studio. UNIDENTIFIED CNN DIRECTOR: Go! Standby to bump everything down, please. LINGERFELT: Well, that's what happens when the president takes over: our shot gets killed. No big deal; happens every day. The best advice I was given is to volunteer and always ask questions if you don't understand what something is. (END VIDEO) Before We Go .

"Washington (CNN) -- Osama bin Laden was buried at sea from the deck of a U.S. aircraft carrier because there was no alternative to bury him on land within the 24 hours required by Islamic law, President Barack Obama's homeland security and counterterrorism adviser said Monday. ""The disposal of -- the burial of bin Laden's remains was done in strict conformance with Islamic precepts and practices. It was prepared in accordance with the Islamic requirements,"" adviser John Brennan told reporters at a White House briefing. ""We early on made provisions for that type of burial and we wanted to make sure that it was going to be done, again, in strictest conformance."" Prothero: Burying bin Laden at sea an elegant solution . The religious rites were conducted on the deck of the USS Carl Vinson in the Arabian Sea, with the ceremony starting at 1:10 a.m. and finishing at 2:10 a.m. ET, according to a senior Defense official. ""The body was washed and placed in a white sheet. A military official read prepared remarks, which were then translated into Arabic by a native speaker, The body of Osama bin Laden was placed on a flat board, which was then tipped up, and allowed to slide into the sea,"" the official said. Planning for bin Laden's burial began months ago as part of contingency planning that took into account numerous possibilities involving the terrorist leader's capture or death, Brennan said. A senior Defense official said no country was willing or able to take bin Laden's body for a funeral. Taking the body to another country and trying to arrange a funeral would have violated the Islamic rule requiring a burial within 24 hours, Brennan said. Opinion: Burial at sea shows compassion of Islamic law . ""There were certain steps that had to be taken because of the nature of the operation,"" Brennan said. ""We wanted to make sure we were able to do that in the time period allotted for it. Going to another country, making those arrangements, requirements, would have exceed that time period, in our view."" The descriptions of the burial appear to indicate U.S. forces did attempt to follow Islamic burial rules, said Juan Campo, a professor of religious studies at the University of California in Santa Barbara who has studied burial rites in the Muslim world. Questions, however, do remain about the rites, Campo said. For one, Islamic law requires that a Muslim read a special funeral prayer during the ceremony. A Muslim chaplain or even a rank-and-file sailor who practices Islam could read the prayer, he said. U.S. officials' statements do not indicate whether the native Arabic speaker was a Muslim. Also, an Islamic authority would normally grant authority to bury a body at sea when a land burial is not an option. Campo said he would want to know who, if anyone, gave that authority. In his briefing, Brennan said U.S. authorities did seek guidance on the burial. ""We consulted the appropriate specialists and experts, and there was unanimity that this would be the best way to handle that,"" he said. That the U.S. forces performed a ritual aboard ship instead of dumping bin Laden's body from an airborne helicopter would mute some criticism of the burial from radical Muslims, Campo said. ""That may temper a lot of that,"" he said. Another concern expressed by U.S. officials was that bin Laden's grave site would become a shrine -- a practice Campo said bin Laden detested but nevertheless likely would have occurred. Rep. Mike Rogers of Michigan, the Republican chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, said burying bin Laden at sea was ""prudent."" ""He was given a proper burial. It removes this -- any thought that there'll be any shrine to Osama bin Laden or grave robbing or any other lasting impact for this death,"" Rogers said. Maher Hathout, senior adviser of the Muslim Public Affairs Council in Los Angeles, said that while the decision was not consistent with Muslim tradition because his death ""did not occur in the ocean,"" the method was pragmatic. ""I don't think it was meant to humiliate, it was meant as an easy way out so we don't have a tomb because there are some people who will sentimentally attach to him, and we should not apologize for that decision,"" Hathout said. CNN's Stan Wilson in Los Angeles contributed to this report.","Administration official says burial conformed to Islamic requirements .

"Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso (CNN) -- Following weeks of unrest, Burkina Faso's president has named a former ambassador as the country's new prime minister, state media reported. A statement signed by President Blaise Compaore named Luc Adolph Tiao, Burkina Faso's former ambassador to France, to the post, RTB, the national radio and television network, reported Monday. Before Tiao was an ambassador, he was president of the Superior Council of Communication of Burkina Faso, which regulates the media. The announcement came after several incidents triggered violence in the western African nation, sparked by different events. There was no information on how many people had been injured. Student protests have been ongoing in the nation since February, according to local media reports. The demonstrations came after a student reportedly died in jail. On March 30, protests erupted over a court case. According to media reports, a man sued a group of five soldiers, claiming they allegedly forced him to take off his clothes and walk home because he had dated a soldier's girlfriend. The court found in favor of the man. During the violence that ensued, the defense minister said his home was attacked. A small group of presidential security guards revolted Thursday night over a promised housing allowance, firing shots inside the presidential compound and taking to the streets, shooting guns, stealing cars and robbing people, according to officials with the Ministry of Defense. Two children of a defense official were shot at and hospitalized, officials said. The soldiers demanded a housing allowance they said the president had promised them. The Ministry of Defense said Friday in a statement the soldiers had been paid but the protests continued, with buildings in the capital city, Ouagadougou, set on fire. The president also reportedly replaced the head of the Army amid the violence. The president was at the palace when the demonstrations began and left briefly under heavy security, but he later returned. In recent days, a curfew was imposed, and sources in the city of Po said violence was also taking place there. A spokesman for the group of security guards, Moussa Ag Abdoulaye, appeared on RTB and reaffirmed the group's committment to the president and called for a cease-fire from other military groups.","The former ambassador to France was named prime minister .

"(CNN) -- New signing Casey Stoner became the first Honda rider to win the opening race of the MotoGP season since 2003 with his third victory in Qatar on Sunday. The Australian emulated seven-time world champion Valentino Rossi's effort as he triumphed after starting in pole position -- he is the only motorcyclist to have ever won at the Losail circuit after qualifying fastest, repeating his 2009 feat. The 25-year-old finished 3.440 seconds ahead of Yamaha's second-placed world champion Jorge Lorenzo, with Honda Repsol teammate Dani Pedrosa third. Rossi, who replaced Stoner at Ducati after leaving Yamaha, finished back in seventh in his debut race for the Italian team. Stoner on pole for MotoGP season-opener in Qatar . Stoner, the 2007 world champion and a winner in Qatar the following year, also started last year's race from pole but crashed on lap six. This time, however, he let teammate Dani Pedrosa pass him early on, while his fellow Spaniard Lorenzo also took the lead during the 22-lap event. Stoner, who dominated the practice sessions before topping qualifying, made his move at the halfway stage to leave last year's championship rivals to battle over the podium places as he clinched his 24th race win in motorcycling's elite class. ""I couldn't have dreamt of a better start to the season, but I'm not going to get carried away and will continue to work,"" he told reporters. ""The first lap was very tough because of how my bike reacted with a full tank. Afterwards it was much better, and the bike improved with every lap until the end."" Another Honda rider, Andrea Dovizioso of Italy, claimed fourth place ahead of Italy's Marco Simoncelli. Lorenzo's young American teammate Ben Spies beat Rossi for sixth place, while veteran U.S. rider Colin Edwards, his compatriot Nicky Hayden on a Ducati and Japan's Hiroshi Aoyama completed the top 10.","Casey Stoner makes winning start to 2011 MotoGP season with victory in Qatar .

"Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama has approved the use of armed Predator drones in Libya, Defense Secretary Robert Gates said Thursday. Gates suggested that the unmanned Predator missions may have already begun. He said he believed that the first flights were launched Thursday but were called back due to poor weather. ""The president has said that where we have some unique capabilities, he is willing to use those,"" Gates said. ""And I think that today may in fact have been their first mission."" Gates said the Predator drones offer a ""modest contribution"" to NATO efforts to support rebels fighting embattled Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi's forces there, though Gadhafi is not a specific target. Unmanned aerial vehicles offer more precise targeting, because their low-flying capability allows for better visibility, ""particularly on targets now that have started to dig themselves into defensive positions,"" Gates said. He said the drones are needed for humanitarian reasons, and they have capabilities that larger aircraft such as A-10s and C-130s cannot provide. Vice Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. James Cartwright said the added precision is necessary because forces loyal to Gadhafi ""nestle up in crowded areas"" to maximize civilian casualties. ""It's very difficult to identify friend from foe,"" Cartwright said, noting that the drones facilitate identification of individuals on the ground. Remote Predator operators are now permitted to strike Gadhafi's defense missions, including air defense, missile and radar sites. Predator strikes are also authorized for civilian protection and can hit Gadhafi's troops, military installations and equipment in the field. The U.S. employed the use of unmanned drones early in the NATO campaign, but they were intended for surveillance only and not authorized to fire.","NEW: ""I think that today may in fact have been their first mission,"" Robert Gates says .

"Beirut, Lebanon (CNN) -- Two people were killed and two others wounded Thursday in clashes in southern Lebanon, the Lebanese Internal Security Forces said. The incident occurred in the southern port city of Tyre, and an investigation is under way into the incident. Residents threw rocks and fired shots at security forces who were trying to stop the illegal construction of homes, the ISF said. Three military cars were burned in the melee, the security forces said. The city is a mix of Christians and Shiite and Sunni Muslims. Palestinians live in refugee camps around the city.","The incident occurred in Tyre .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Two men are being sought for questioning in the brazen daylight robbery of a jewelry store last week, in which some $65 million in merchandise was stolen, authorities said Tuesday. Security camera footage shows images of the men wanted by police. Detectives released surveillance camera photos of the two, in addition to images of some of the rings, bracelets, necklaces and watches taken from Graff Jewellers on central London's New Bond Street. A total of 43 items were taken, with a value of about £40 million, or about $65 million, Scotland Yard said. The heist occurred Thursday, when two men walked into the jewelry store at about 4:40 p.m. and threatened employees with handguns. As the robbers were leaving the store, they brought a female worker outside with them before leaving in a blue BMW, Scotland Yard said. A shot was fired outside the store, but no one was injured. The men abandoned the BMW nearby, firing a second shot into the ground, Scotland Yard said. Police believe they switched to a silver Mercedes, then later to a black vehicle, possibly a Ford or Volkswagen. ""This was a well-planned robbery with a number of vehicles used to help the robbers escape,"" Detective Chief Inspector Pam Mace said in the statement. ""These men are extremely dangerous and fired at least two shots in busy London streets as they made their getaway.  Watch how robbers rip off London jewelers » . ""Someone knows who these men are,"" she said. ""They would undoubtedly have spoken about (the robbery) before or boasted about it afterwards. I would urge anyone who recognizes them, knows the whereabouts of the jewelry or has any other information to contact us."" The images show the two men dressed in suits and ties. One man is white, about 30, police said. The second is a black man believed to be in his 30s with short hair. Both men are thought to have spoken with London accents, Scotland Yard said. The robbery is the latest in a spate of daytime thefts at jewelry stores and designer shops in London's exclusive shopping areas of Bond Street, which includes New Bond Street. Groups of men or teenagers typically stage ""smash and grab"" robberies, in which they break the windows and steal anything they can get their hands on before speeding away in waiting cars or motorbikes. A CNN camera crew filming in March on Oxford Street, near Bond Street, caught a group of thieves speeding away on motorbikes from a jewelry store they had just robbed. The thieves choose to strike during the day when a store's security system is typically disarmed, even though the store and sidewalk may be crowded with people.","Two men sought over brazen daylight robbery of a jewelry store in London .

"(WIRED)  -- Reddit, the community news sharing site, has now joined the billion-page-per-month club, having served up some 1,000,404,480 pages to almost 14 million unique visitors in January, as measured by Google Analytics. That means Reddit, once largely seen as a geekier also-ran to Digg, has now handily surpassed its better-funded rival in traffic. Reddit was started in 2005 by Alexis Ohanian and Steve Huffman as part of the inaugural class of Y-Combinator. Conde Nast purchased the site in October 2006, putting Reddit under the same corporate master as Wired.com. Reddit, with a staff of about 10 now, has seen an extraordinary rise in traffic -- quadrupling page views since January 2010. Reddit got a traffic spike of about 30% in traffic in August/September, due to an influx of Digg users responding to the the spectacular failure of Digg's redesign, according to Reddit engineer Jeremy Edberg. But much of the growth must be attributed to Reddit's ability to retain a sense of belonging to a club, even as the site grows and grows. WIRED: Reddit vs. Digg rivalry by the numbers . While the front page is still the most popular part of the site, Reddit also has a wide collection of ""sub-reddits"" dedicated to particular topics and communities, including the not-to-be missed IAMA. That stands for I Am A, and is a section of the site where people who are something -- from a Comcast technician to an Egyptian arrested in the anti-government protest -- offer to answer questions from curious users. Reddit announced the milestone to its loyal and demanding userbase on Wednesday in a blog post by engineer Mike Schiraldi: . ""There are only about 100 sites on the entire Internet that get a billion pageviews in a single month, and now Reddit can put on its smoking jacket and join that exclusive club. ""The New York Times isn't on the membership list, nor is Expedia, Weather.com, about.com, or Fox News. In your face, meteorologists! ""This is an accomplishment that all Redditors should take pride in, because people wouldn't keep arriving in droves -- and coming back -- if not for the community that you've created here."" As a side note, I first wrote about Reddit when they were just finished with Y-Combinator's summer mentorships, and Ohanian was very excited to tell me the site had more than 600 users. It's safe to say the site now has plenty more than that, even as Ohanian and Huffman, along with the site's first employee Chris Slowe are now huddled together working on Hipmunk, a airline ticket search site. Reddit remains in capable hands, and the numerically-limited staff has done amazing work with limited resources scaling the site, even when this reporter, who sits about 15 yards away from their office, shoots foam-tipped darts at their glass door for fun.

"Along The Libya-Tunisia Border (CNN) -- A green flag fluttering in the wind designated Libyan territory. A short distance away, a red flag flew for Tunisia. In between, a mass of humanity waited in no man's land, desperate to flee escalating rebellion in one nation and cross into another that has already succeeded in toppling a dictator. Periodically, a ripple flowed through the crowd of thousands of refugees as men took turns passing forward dazed and unconscious travelers, overwhelmed by a treacherous journey to the border and exposure to the elements. Tunisian emergency workers rushed with fluorescent orange stretchers to evacuate the sick. Chaos reigned along Libya's western border Tuesday as Tunisian police attempted to hold back a tide of people, mostly foreign workers caught in the storm of change blowing through the region. There were simply too many people crossing too fast, overwhelming Tunisian authorities, aid agencies and volunteers trying to get a handle on what the United Nations called a humanitarian catastrophe in the making. The U.N. refugee agency reported that nearly 150,000 people have crossed over from Libya into Tunisia and Egypt. A majority are Egyptians -- more than 1 million Egyptian citizens were working in neighboring Libya. But the fleeing foreigners also include citizens of Bangladesh, Thailand, Vietnam, Ghana, Sudan, Mali and other countries who traveled far from home in search of economic salvation. Now, many of them said they had everything stolen from them on the road to the border and are left with nothing but the clothes on their back. ""No money! Gadhafi's militia took my money,"" said Mohammad Ataye, an Egyptian who spent the last year working as a hairdresser in Libya.  He was referring to troops still loyal to Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi. Ataye said he tried to catch a flight out of Tripoli's airport to Egypt, but was forced back by thousands of people waiting there. When he and a friend decided to make a run for the Tunisian border, Libyan soldiers robbed him of his savings and his two mobile phones on the way. Now what for the Egyptian refugee?  ""I don't know. I don't know,"" he said. Some of those fleeing Libya do not possess passports and other travel documents, which are often confiscated by the companies that employ them until their contracts are fulfilled, said Mathieu Luciano of the International Organization for Migration. Luciano, deployed to the Egyptian border town of Sallum to help shuttle people out, said his agency was working with the embassies of nations involved as well as the companies that hired the migrant workers to return them home safely. The agency is paying for a charter flight from Bangladesh that is scheduled to arrive later Tuesday. The Egyptian government has reported 69,000 people crossing into that nation. One of them is Mohamed Sohel. Sohel, who had been working for a Korean construction company in the eastern Libyan city of Durna for three years, was anxious to board a plane back home to Bangladesh. He said he has been surviving by sharing one piece of flatbread with two other men since arriving at the Egyptian border town of Sallum six days ago. His passport was locked up at the company's Libyan headquarters in the western town of Misrata. ""We called the Bangladeshi embassy a thousand times,"" Sohel said. ""We never got any advice, or help."" It's easier for Egyptian workers to make it back home, Luciano said, but nonetheless, they face a difficult situation. They were the breadwinners, supporting families in rural Egypt. They are returning with no livelihood in a time of uncertainty in their own homeland. Some said they were frustrated with their interim military government for not doing more to help them. ""As we know, Egypt is also under a lot of stress now politically,"" said Hovig Etyemezian, a field officer with the U.N. refugee agency.""So any country that is able to provide air lift or sea movement should pick up the ball so that more people leave, more Egyptians are able to go back to their country."" On Libya's border with Tunisia, the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees staff erected 500 tents.  All of them are full. The global body appealed to member nations to help evacuate the stranded. ""The biggest priority is to take people out of the country,"" Etyemezian said.  ""Now the [border] crossing is anywhere between 10 to 13,000 people a day. And the outgoing is 3 to 4,000. So we need to have a bigger capacity of people leaving the country."" Police and soldiers watched, as young Tunisian volunteers used sticks to beat back people trying to jump over a wall next to the border gate into Tunisia. Volunteers threw bread and bottles of water into the no man's land between the red and green flags. Thousands of people have been waiting there for as many as three days, enduring bitter cold without shelter. Staff members with the U.N. refugee agency described the water and sanitation situation as precarious. Tunisian authorities told the agency that about 75,000 people have streamed into Tunisia. Up to 15,000 more people are expected to arrive Tuesday and the agency said it was ""becoming critically important that onwards transport becomes quickly available to avoid a humanitarian crisis."" The refugee agency said it was particularly concerned about a large number of sub-Saharan Africans who are being denied entry into Tunisia. They may be targets for retribution after reports that embattled Gadhafi recruited mercenaries from those nations to suppress the uprising in his country. CNN's Ivan Watson reported from the Libya-Tunisia border and Moni Basu reported from Atlanta.","Many of those fleeing are foreign workers in Libya .

"(CNN) -- Cycling at the Tour de France has taken a techie turn. Nike's Web site shows messages written by a Chalkbot on the Tour de France course. Not only is Lance Armstrong posting to Twitter from the race, but a Chalkbot -- a robot that writes in water-soluble paint -- is scribing messages onto the road, offering inspiration to the competitors and to cancer survivors. The Chalkbot takes input from text messages and Twitter posts sent by the public. The robot, a tractor-like device that's pulled around by a truck, then paints those messages in large yellow letters along the Tour de France course. The letters face the riders so they can read them on their journey during the grueling annual race, which ends July 26 in Paris. Nathan Martin, CEO of Deeplocal, a mobile software company in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, helped design the robot as part of an ad campaign for Nike. He said the Chalkbot is part of a trend in art and marketing: Digital creations are taking on real-world forms to get noticed and to have greater impact. ""We have so much clutter and no editorship [online],"" he said. ""You can launch new Web sites all the time, but it's really hard to stand out. I think the way to stand out is for people to think you have a real impact on your lives."" That sense of true impact is best achieved through real-world manifestations of online art, he said. The temporary paint messages are a high-tech take on old traditions at the Tour de France, said Derek Kent, a spokesman for Nike. ""If you talk to any cyclist, they'll tell you there's a longstanding tradition to chalk messages of support,"" he said. ""And what we've done is taken that insight and bought it to another level, so that someone in Asia can participate in the Tour and feel a part of something bigger."" The Chalkbot ad campaign ties in with Livestrong, nickname of the Lance Armstrong Foundation, which is devoted to cancer research and was founded by U.S. cyclist Armstrong, a cancer survivor. Kent said many of the messages drawn by the Chalkbot are from cancer survivors or their friends and family. A photo of one road message posted on Nike's Web site says ""My mom climbed over Mt. Cancer."" Another says ""If not us who / if not now when."" People who send text messages or Twitter posts will be notified if their notes are chalked onto the road in France, Martin said. The robot takes a picture of the words on the road and sends that image, along with GPS coordinates, to the person who submitted it, he said. Martin said the Chalkbot was writing about 200 messages per day in the early days of the tour, which kicked off July 4. Some towns along the route have banned the robot from writing on their streets, but most sections of the course have supported the ad campaign, he said. The robot writes its messages in paint that washes away quickly, he said. Martin declined to say how much the robot cost to build but said the effort is far less expensive than developing a television commercial. The Chalkbot looks somewhat like a farm tractor and is fitted with 48 nozzles that spray out a mixture of air and temporary paint. A truck pulls the robot along the course at about 5 mph, and a person with a laptop sends commands to the device, telling it which messages to spray onto the road, according to Deeplocal. To send a message to the Chalkbot, post a message to @chalkbot on Twitter, followed by the tag #LIVESTRONG, or text LIVESTRONG, followed by a message, to 36453. Messages must be 40 characters or less. Check out this video on Nike's site to see the Chalkbot in action.","Chalkbot scrawls text messages and Twitter posts on Tour de France route .

"Buenos Aires, Argentina (CNN) -- An Argentine Dirty War-era general has been sentenced to life in prison for the killing of five people during the dictatorship. Luciano Benjamin Menendez, former head of the Third Army Corps, was already serving a life sentence for violating the human rights of four others. A panel of judges on the Argentine court handed down the sentence Wednesday. Sentenced along with Menendez was former policeman Roberto Heriberto Albornoz, who was also sent to prison for life. Up to 30,000 students, labor leaders, intellectuals and leftists who ran afoul of the dictatorship because of their political views disappeared or were held in secret jails and torture centers during the nation's eight-year Dirty War. Menendez's most recent trial stems from an army and police assault on a home in Tucuman province on May 20, 1976, according to Argentina's Center for Judicial Information. A group of Montoneros, an urban guerrilla group, was meeting inside the house before the forces launched explosives and entered the house, the center said. The soldiers and police killed four people inside the house, and also killed one who escaped.","Luciano Benjamin Menendez was the head of the Third Army Corps .

"Bangkok, Thailand (CNN) -- Military commanders along the turbulent Thai-Cambodian border agreed to a cease-fire on Thursday, a Thai military source told CNN. A border dispute that turned violent over the last week remains volatile, and the hiatus was forged at the unit commander level but not the higher levels of the militaries. The source, who asked not to be named because he is not authorized to speak, said if the peace persists, higher-ranking people may meet on Friday. They would be Thailand's 2nd Region commander, Lt. Gen Tawatchai Samutsakorn, and Lt. Gen. Chea Mon, Cambodia's 5th Army Region commander. Cambodia's government spokesman could not be reached for comment. Indonesia has offered to provide observers in the border area and help both sides resolve the crisis diplomatically. Thailand's Foreign Minister Kasit Piromya met with Indonesian Foreign Minister Marty Natalegawa in Jakarta. Indonesia currently holds the chair of the the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). Natalegawa also said Thailand welcomes the deployment of an Indonesian observer team to the disputed area. This idea was first agreed upon, in an emergency meeting of ASEAN's Foreign Ministers in February, also in Jakarta. The observers have not been deployed, after Thailand later stated their presence was not needed. ""I just want to reassure that Thailand will work very earnestly and in a very serious manner with Indonesia in the role of Indonesia as a great facilitator,"" said Piromya. However, he maintained Thailand's position was on the defensive in recently renewed clashes with Cambodia. ""I just want to use this opportunity to once again reaffirm that the military action by the Thai side was only on the defensive side. We have not made any aggression. It was only (an) appropriate response to the conflict that was started by the Cambodian side,"" he said. Natalegawa said he and Piromya were able to discuss terms of reference for the Indonesian observer team. ""I think it's quite fair to say that we have made a very good progress, and I could say that we are truly in the brink of confirming the agreement by all sides. Based on my conversation just now, I shall be circulating to both Thailand and Cambodia what I hope to be the final version of the Term of Reference for its immediate early adoption by the parties concerned."" U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon is urging both nations to pursue ""an effective and verifiable cease-fire."" Clashes between the two started Friday as they accused each other of trying to seize ancient temples. Thailand calls the temples Ta Kwai and Ta Muen, while Cambodia calls them Ta Krabey and Ta Moan. Much of the border between the two countries remains in dispute. Both sides claim the disputed temples are in their country. Fighting flared up in February along another disputed border area between the two nations, prompting the U.N. Security Council to issue a statement calling on both sides to implement a cease-fire. Those clashes stemmed from a longstanding conflict related to the 11th-century Preah Vihear temple. Both Cambodia and Thailand lay claim to the temple, which sits atop a cliff on Cambodian soil but has its most accessible entrance on the Thai side.","Unit level commanders worked out the hiatus .

"(CNN) -- The intentional breach of a levee on the Mississippi River is sending 396,000 cubic feet per second of water onto 200 square miles of fertile Missouri farmland. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers said the operation is helping to ease unprecedented flood pressure on other areas. While the plan appeared to be working -- the level of the Ohio River fell where it joins the Mississippi -- record crests and relentless pressure from millions of gallons of water still threatened communities throughout the Mississippi and Ohio river valleys. Vicksburg, Mississippi, could see water levels rise 4 feet by Sunday. Residents in Caruthersville, Missouri, were told sandbags may not be enough to control the water. Corina Jolley, of Sikeston, Missouri, told CNN she grew up in Dorena, Missouri, which she said was being inundated by the breach on the Mississippi River. A tombstone rests above the remains of her father and uncle, but ""I'm sure we'll never see it again,"" said Jolley, who claims residents of the rich farmland will be out of luck, as opposed to those in Cairo, Illinois, for whom the risk has been lessened by the breaches. ""Whoever thought it would be this bad?"" she said. The Corps reported river levels had fallen more than a foot since engineers detonated explosives late Monday night at Birds Point, Missouri, briefly illuminating the night sky like lightning and sending water coursing across a floodway that Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon described as ""literally the most productive part of our continent."" The Ohio River level had dropped about 1.7 feet at Cairo since Monday afternoon, before the blast, but that is expected to level off Wednesday and hover close to 60 feet the rest of the week. Other sections showed modest decreases or no changes Tuesday. Paducah, Kentucky, on the Ohio River, is expected to see levels go from 54.7 feet Tuesday night to 55.3 on Sunday. A second levee blast was conducted Tuesday afternoon at New Madrid, Missouri, and a third is planned Wednesday near Hickman, Kentucky. The second and third blasts, downstream of Birds Point, will allow floodwater to return to the Mississippi River. After the first blast late Monday, the National Weather Service lowered its crest projection for the Ohio River at Smithland, Kentucky -- upriver from the levee breach -- to 55 feet from the previous 58-foot prediction. But even that forecast is more than 3 1/2 feet higher than the record set at that location in 1997, according to weather service records. Flood stage there is 40 feet. The town of Cairo remained under a mandatory evacuation despite the intentional breach, while six other communities were under voluntary evacuation notices, said Patti Thompson, spokeswoman for the Illinois Emergency Management Agency. ""We're definitely not out of the woods yet,"" she said. ""The levees are all very saturated right now and they're going to continue to have a lot of pressure on them for several days."" Commercial shipping was affected by the levee blasting and subsequent debris removal. The segment at the confluence of the Mississippi and Ohio rivers, near Cairo, opened late Tuesday afternoon, said U.S. Coast Guard Cmdr. Claudia Gelzer. Two other Mississippi River sections along the Missouri-Kentucky border will reopen Wednesday or later, she said. Gelzer did not know how many vessels were affected, but said companies had prepared for the closings. The National Weather Service continues to predict record or near-record flooding in parts of southern Illinois, southwest Indiana, western Kentucky and Tennessee, southeastern Missouri, northeastern Arkansas and, later, parts of Mississippi and Louisiana. Maj. Gen. Michael Walsh, commander of the Corps' Mississippi River Valley Division, made the decision to order the breach. He warned that without punching a hole in the levee, massive flooding would threaten to inundate communities throughout the Mississippi and Ohio river valleys. ""There's a tremendous amount of pressure on the system,"" he told reporters Tuesday evening. ""The project operated as designed."" It was a controversial decision. Missouri officials took the Corps to court over the plan, questioning the agency's authority to intentionally breach the levee. The state argued the floodwater would deposit silt on the 130,000-some acres, and years, along with millions of dollars, would be required to fix the damage. The U.S. Supreme Court declined to intervene in the case on Sunday, clearing the way for Walsh's decision Monday to blow the levee. Some Missouri residents were angered, arguing the decision would destroy their communities and provide questionable benefit. But others felt the decision was for the best. ""Yeah, we lost 135,000 acres of farm land here in Missouri,"" said Sikeston, Missouri, resident Patricia Mobely, who recently fled the drought and firestorms of Texas for what she thought would be a more peaceful life in the Midwest. ""But how much more would we have lost if we hadn't done it?"" The river diversion and other flooding has had an impact on pets and livestock. Thirty-one animals rescued from flood waters in southeastern Missouri are heading to St. Louis, including 24 domestic rabbits found abandoned inside a cotton gin trailer, according to CNN affiliate KSDK. Walsh said the fate of Cairo was just one of many factors in his decision, saying he hoped the move would alleviate problems throughout the Mississippi River system. Water levels and flooding have hit record highs in many spots, putting severe strains on systems meant to prevent uncontrolled floods and the resulting loss of life and property. He called the decision to inundate the farmland and about 100 homes ""heart-wrenching."" ""I've been involved with flooding for 10 years and it takes a long time to recover from something like this,"" he said. The governors of Illinois and Missouri said authorities in both states were prepared for the blasts and subsequent flooding, according to prepared statements. ""I urge Missourians to continue to cooperate fully with state, county and local law enforcement, as they have at every stage of this process,"" Nixon said. ""Together, we will ensure that Missouri families stay safe in the coming days. And together, we will recover and rebuild."" A statement released by Illinois Gov. Pat Quinn's office called the decision to breach the levee ""an important step to ensure public safety as we respond to this crisis."" Even as the river was falling, Walsh did not rule out similar moves elsewhere along the Mississippi and its tributaries, saying the levee system is under unprecedented pressure and warning water levels could rise again. ""This doesn't end this historic flood,"" he said. Evacuation notices have been posted in Indiana, Kentucky and Tennessee, where rising tributaries have threatened dozens of communities. Kentucky Gov. Steve Beshear visited three counties to assess response efforts. Nearly 4,000 residents in the cities of Smithland, Hickman and Ledbetter have been evacuated, according to a statement from his office. Counties in central and northeast Arkansas were affected, including areas along the Black and White rivers, said spokesman Tommy Jackson of the Arkansas Department of Emergency Management. The mayor of Dyersburg, Tennessee, urged residents of parts of his community to evacuate ahead of significant flooding there forecast for Wednesday night, and residents and officials in Paducah, Kentucky, were closely watching a levee holding back the Ohio River that has showed signs of failing. ""We are in uncharted water,"" Paducah Mayor Bill Paxton said. CNN's Phil Gast contributed to this report.","NEW: Animals rescued in southeast Missouri .

"(CNN) -- A 12-year-old suicide bomber killed three other people, including a district council head, and armed attackers shot to death two police officers Sunday, the first day of a Taliban spring offensive. The attacks followed a Taliban declaration Saturday that its spring military operations will focus on attacks against military bases, airbases, convoys, heads of foreign and local companies, and members of the local government. In Shaken district of Paktika province, the 12-year-old boy detonated explosives in his vest to kill district council head Shernawaz Khan and two others, said Mukhlis Afghan, a spokesman for the Paktika provincial governor. The blast also wounded 12 people, Afghan said, adding: ""The suicide attacker's aim was to target the district council chief."" In a separate attack, armed men opened fire on police in southern Ghazni province, killing two police officers, provincial police security commander Abdul Hassan said. According to Hassan, two armed Taliban insurgents on a motorbike opened fire on police officers and then fled the area. In its declaration Saturday, the Taliban warned that it also would target members of the High Peace Council, who are influential citizens trying to generate dialogue with the militants. ""All Afghan people should bear in mind to keep away from gatherings, convoys and centers of the enemy so that they will not become harmed during attacks of the Mujahedeen against the enemy,"" the statement said. The Taliban said that ""strict attention"" must be paid to protecting civilians. ""Utilizing all proven military tactics, the operations will focus on usage of advanced weapons against the air and ground forces of the invaders, tip-and-run attacks, and group offensives, city attacks, advanced explosives attacks, effective group and martyrdom seeking attacks by warrior Mujahedeen,"" the statement said. However, the deployment of a young suicide bomber Sunday appeared to contradict a Taliban statement that the insurgents intended to avoid using civilian attackers. ""I would like to announce that (the) Islamic Movement is committed to pay extra attention for not arming civilians during their operations on the enemy's targets across the country,"" Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mojahed said in an e-mail to CNN. The Taliban regime in Afghanistan had been sheltering the al Qaeda terror network when it launched attacks against the United States on September 11, 2001. The United States cranked up military operations the next month that led to the toppling of that government. Ever since, international forces have been fighting Islamic militants in Afghanistan and Pakistan and attempting to support and build the successor Afghan government. The Taliban announcement comes a day after a NATO official said the alliance anticipates insurgents to begin an extensive round of attacks against U.S. and coalition forces ""in the coming days."" The officer with NATO's International Security Assistance Force noted that the alliance has seen similar surges at this time in recent years. The coalition feels that the increased attacks on insurgents have had an impact, and new attacks by insurgents signal their effort to recoup their losses, the officer said. In a statement Saturday addressing the expected escalation in fighting, the U.N. Assistance Mission in Afghanistan urged all parties to avoid harming civilians. Staffan de Mistura, head of the mission, called on the Taliban ""to carry out their previously stated decision to avoid civilian casualties."" ""Parties to the conflict must not deliberately attack, target or kill civilians, or indiscriminately harm them,"" said de Mistura, who was quoted in the statement. ""We call on all parties to take all possible measures to protect civilians, especially in the forthcoming months when we expect, unfortunately, intensified conflict."" In the 90 days ending April 22, coalition special forces conducted 1,393 operations, capturing or killing 468 insurgent commanders, and capturing or killing 2,637 lower-level insurgents. This all comes as the Pentagon released its latest report to Congress on the progress in Afghanistan. The military says gains made in Afghanistan over the last half year has created the ""necessary conditions"" to begin transferring control of security to the Afghanistan government in seven areas of the country inhabited by approximately 20% to 25% of the population. The latest semi-annual report concludes that insurgent momentum has been halted in much of the country, though the gains are ""fragile and reversible."" However, the report notes that efforts to fortify government and development was ""slower than security gains"" over the last six months. The total number of security incidents were higher from October 2010 through March 2011 compared with the same period of the winter of 2009-10, the report said. The report says this is mainly due to increased coalition and Afghan troop presence, which allowed for a higher pace of operations against insurgents' safe havens. CNN's Adam Levine, Barbara Starr, Fazel Reshad, Matiullah Mati and Joe Sterling contributed to this report.","A 12-year-old boy detonates a suicide bomb, killing three people .

It was Gorges' second title of her career -- she won the 2010 Bad Gastein trophy -- and means she will now break into the world's top 30 for the first time. Wozniacki started the day looking to add to the titles she has already won in 2011 at events in Dubai, Indian Wells and Charleston. But the 20-year-old couldn't compete with Gorges' strong serve and crisp baseline shots on the day, managing only nine winners during the match. ""Julia played really well. She was very aggressive and everything was going in. I tried everything but it wasn't enough. I'll go back to the practice court and try to be better next time,"" Wozniacki said, AFP reported. It was Wozniacki's second final defeat of 2011 after she lost to Russia's Vera Zvonareva at the Qatar Ladies Open in Doha at the end of February. Meanwhile at the Fes Grand Prix in Morocco, Italy's Alberta Brianti clinched her first WTA Tour title by beating Romania's Simona Halep 6-4 6-3 in the final on Sunday. Brianti need just one hour and 17 minutes to defeat seventh seed Halep, who also lost in last year's final. The 31-year-old Brianti broke Halep's serve twice in the first set and three more times in the second as the 19-year-old struggled for consistency on her serve all match. The Italian's previous best result on the WTA Tour was runner-up at the International Women's Open in Guangzhou in 2009.","Germany's Julia Gorges beats Denmark's Caroline Wozniacki in Stuttgart final .

"(Mashable)  -- After the rumor that Apple won't announce the next-generation of iPhone in June or July (which was the case with all previous iPhone announcements), comes a report that the new iPhone is actually coming in the fall. While Apple's suppliers will begin production in July this year, the finished product is likely to begin shipping in September, Reuters reports citing sources familiar with the matter. As for what the actual features of the next-gen iPhone, the details are scarce as always; one of Reuters' sources claims the device will look similar to the iPhone 4, but it will feature a faster processor. To quickly piece together all the iPhone rumors and reports we've seen, this is what we have: the white version of the iPhone 4 should become available within 2-3 weeks; the iPhone 5 (if that's what Apple will call it) will be an evolutionary upgrade, visually similar to the iPhone 4 but with a better camera, processor and a bigger screen.

The 23-year-old Vettel, who was claiming his 11th victory in just his 63rd grand prix, told the official Formula One website: ""I'm very pleased, it was a very good weekend and I had a very nice car to sit in this afternoon. ""It was a good race and towards the end things calmed down a bit as Lewis didn't push as hard."" The German continued: ""The start was crucial and being on the clean side I had a very good getaway.

"(CNN) -- Australia showed no mercy for earthquake-hit neighbors New Zealand as a fine bowling display earned the defending champions a seven-wicket victory at the 2011 Cricket World Cup in Nagpur on Friday. A minute's silence was observed before the match to honor the victims of Tuesday's quake in Christchurch, which has left more than 110 people dead, and both teams -- wearing black armbands -- huddled together in a display of solidarity. But once the action began, the Kiwis struggled to perform after losing the toss and being sent into bat. When Ross Taylor became Shaun Tait's third victim with the last ball of the 17th over, New Zealand had collapsed to 73-6. New Zealand death toll rises . Nathan McCullum showed some resistance with 52 off 76 balls, and captain Daniel Vettori hit a lusty 44 off 43 deliveries, but the Black Caps could bat only 45.1 of their allotted 50 overs to be all out for a disappointing 206. Left-arm fast bowler Mitchell Johnson was the pick of the Australian bowlers with figures of 4-33 off 9.1 overs, while Tait took 3-35 from seven overs. Australia, seeking a fourth successive title and fifth overall, then made light work of the run chase to clinch a second win from two Group A games -- and 25th in a row at the four-yearly tournament. Openers Shane Watson (62) and Brad Haddin (55) put on 133 in just 18 overs, while vice-captain Michael Clarke (24) and Cameron White (22) were unbeaten as they came home with 16 overs to spare -- helped by a sloppy 29 wides from the New Zealand bowlers. Vettori said the tragic events back home could not be used as an excuse for his team's poor performance. ""It would be unfair to the people who are going through a lot worse than we are over here to say that was the reason we didn't play very well today. We're professional sportsmen and we have to get up for these games,"" he told reporters in quotes carried by the AFP agency. Australia fast bowler Doug Bollinger has been ruled out for the rest of the tournament, having also missed the opening win over Zimbabwe after suffering an ankle injury in a warm-up match. West Indies all-rounder Dwayne Bravo will be out for four weeks after suffering a similar problem in Thursday's defeat by South Africa, ending his participation unless his team reach the semifinals. In Friday's Group B action, Bangladesh survived a big scare before avoiding a second consecutive defeat, beating Ireland by 27 runs in Dhaka. Bangladesh, beaten by co-hosts India in the opening game of the tournament, were bowled out for just 205 in the final over despite making a roaring start on a slow pitch. Opener Tamim Iqbal top-scored with 44 off 43 balls but after he was third man out with the total at 68 in the 12th over, captain Mushfiqur Rahim (36) and Raqibul Hasan (38) played patient innings to steady proceedings. However, South Africa-born Andre Botha (3-32), left-arm spinner George Dockrell (2-23) and Australia-born Trent Johnston (2-40) combined to give the Irish hope of repeating their win over Bangladesh at the 2007 World Cup. And the run chase was looking good at 151-5, but then Kevin O'Brien (37) became the first of four victims for young fast bowler Shafiul Islam in the 37th over as the last six wickets fell for just 27 runs.

"(CNN) -- Thousands desperate to flee intense fighting in western Libya have begun pouring into neighboring Tunisia in recent days, raising concerns Tuesday among aid agencies that the humanitarian crisis could worsen. The fighting between forces loyal to Moammar Gadhafi and rebels demanding an end to the dictator's four-decade rule increased over the weekend, with both sides struggling to control Libya's western mountainous region -- home to Berber tribes long persecuted by the Libyan leader. ""In the last two days, we have seen 6,000 Libyans come through,"" Firas Kayal, of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, said by phone from near the Tunisian border town of Dehiba. ""This is a new situation we are dealing with because prior to the fleeing of the Libyan families, we were dealing only with the migrant workers, and now these are Libyan families -- a new situation in Dehiba."" He said about 10,000 to 12,000 Libyans were estimated to have arrived in the last 10 days in Dehiba, where the U.N. aid agency has set up a tent city on a soccer field to accommodate up to 1,200 people. Others have been offered shelter in hotels, youth centers and private homes, Kayal said. ""Some of the families said their neighborhoods were bombed. Others said they weren't waiting for the fighting, that they were fleeing out of fear,"" he said. A second camp set up in Remada, just north of Dehiba, was providing shelter to about 1,000 people, Kayal said. The situation in Libya has become increasingly precarious for civilians and migrant workers, who have been caught in the crossfire of the conflict that has killed tens of thousands and left thousands more wounded since it began two months ago. NATO-led forces began bombing regime targets in Libya last month after the U.N. Security Council approved a resolution authorizing any means necessary to protect civilians. More than 550,000 people, mostly migrant workers, have fled the country for neighboring countries. Many of those arriving in Dehiba were fleeing fighting near Nalut, about 50 kilometers from the Tunisian border, which has been ""effectively under siege by government forces for about a month and that the pressure on the civilian population has be increasing daily,"" Andrej Mahecic, a spokesman with the U.N aid agency, said during a press briefing in Geneva. From the border town of Dehiba, pillars of black smoke could be seen and loud explosions could be heard from inside Libya, Kayal said. It has been difficult to track the exact number of Libyans who have fled the country, because few have claimed asylum. ""They Libyans leaving aren't refugees,"" said Jemini Pandya, a spokeswoman with the International Organization for Migration (IOM), which tracks the movement of migrants. ""They have had resources to look after themselves. They have gone ... to hotel, to houses."" Typically, the Libyans have fled until fighting abated in an area and then returned home, she said. ""If you're now having to set up tented camps to house the number of Libyans, then clearly the situation is changing,"" Pandya said. The desire among Libyans to leave, though, appears to be growing in hard-hit places, such as Misrata, which faces near daily shelling by Gadhafi's forces. Government forces have cut off all land access to the port city. The only escape route is by sea. A boat chartered by IOM that was delivering aid and picking up wounded in Misrata was forced to stop Monday in the break waters just outside the city of Misrata after Libyans crammed the port, hoping to board the ship to leave the city, Pandya said. ""Some had been separated from families. Others wanted to get out of the conflict zone,"" she said. U.S. President Barack Obama has described the attack on Misrata as a medieval siege. Kareem Khadder and Chelsea J. Carter contributed to this report.","As fighting spreads in Libya, thousands flee the intense fighting .

"Cairo (CNN) -- A documentary filmmaker who followed Osama bin Laden's jihad against the Soviets in the mountains of Afghanistan during the 1980s said he once warned the world's most-wanted terrorist against attacking civilians. Esam Daraz's films and books documented the birth of bin Laden's al Qaeda terror organization, and they ultimately helped cultivate bin Laden's international notoriety and inspire the jihadist movement of the 1980s. The former Egyptian Intelligence army officer established himself as an acclaimed filmmaker after producing 30 documentary films in Egypt through his own production company founded in 1978. ""Afghanistan was the hotspot in 1980s so I decided to document the brutal Soviet attacks on the Muslims. I embedded with many of the leading Arab fighters on the battlefield and they trusted me so they led me to bin Laden. I followed his trail from 1987 until 1991, "" Daraz explained reminiscing as he went through his archive of footage stored in his Cairo studio. Daraz filmed bin laden and his 120 Arab fighters in the first training camp located amid the rugged terrain of Afghanistan. The men back then came from Saudi Arabia, Yemen and Egypt. He produced three documentaries and five books about the war in Afghanistan, but his film ""Arab Supporters in Afghanistan"" remains his favorite piece of work because it featured bin Laden's first appearance on video. ""The film was distributed across video stores in the Arabian Gulf. Stores were selling 20 copies at a time and sometimes in the hundreds as I learned when I contacted them anonymously inquiring about the sales. Many wholesale buyers distributed the film for free outside mosques in Saudi Arabia,"" he added. Daraz claims that his film inspired thousands of Arab youth to join bin Laden's small group of fighters. ""Bin Laden's office manager in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, informed me that millions of Saudi Riyals were donated by people and organizations supporting the movement after the release of my film,"" said Daraz. Around 1988 al Qaeda was established and Daraz met Ayman Al Zawahiri, also known on the field as Dr. Abdel Moez or bin Laden's personal adviser and physician. ""I watched him personally monitor bin Laden's consistent low blood pressure and give him the required medicine many times on the battlefield,"" said Daraz. Zawhiri's experience as the leader of the Egyptian Islamic Jihad supported bin Laden's aspirations calling for global jihad. Bin Laden's secret of success was his compassion and his humbleness, according to Esam Daraz. Daraz followed his friend bin Laden to Saudi Arabia in 1991 and stayed in his lavish villa housing his four wives and numerous children. Bin Laden was received as a hero who defeated the Soviets in Afghanistan. His public rhetoric against the Saudi government's cooperation with the U.S. administration got him in big trouble. Daraz warned bin Laden about attacking civilians but the world's most wanted terrorist did not listen. ""He drove me to the airport, and I sadly returned to Egypt in the winter of 1991 wondering if I would ever see him again,"" said Daraz. Evidently, bin Laden's family disowned him and he was exiled to Sudan in 1992. On May 2, 2011, bin Laden was shot and killed by U.S. Navy SEALs inside a residential compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan in a covert operation authorized by President Barack Obama. The world awaited the release of images of a dead Bin Laden for proof and closure to the families who lost loved one's in the September 11 attacks orchestrated by al Qaeda. Bin Laden had claimed responsibility for the attacks in 2004 after years of denial. The White House announced that they it will not release ""trophy"" pictures of Osama Bin Laden's body. ""You will not see bin Laden walking on this Earth again,"" Obama said. Esam Daraz disagrees with bin Laden and supports Obama's decision. ""I cried when I saw the twin towers collapsing. I am a military man against the killing of civilians,"" he said. ""Obama is wise. The release of the photos would have provoked people who already disagree with the way he was killed and the disposal of the body at sea, even if those people did not support bin Laden's views.""","Esam Daraz followed bin Laden's jihad against the Soviets .

"Madrid, Spain (CNN) -- Four suspected Islamic militants are due to go on trial Thursday afternoon in Madrid for allegedly aiding fugitives from the Madrid train bombings of 2004, a National Court spokesman told CNN. Prosecutor Miguel Angel Carballo, at Spain's National Court, seeks sentences of eight to 13 years in prison against the four male suspects, who include a Moroccan, an Algerian, a Tunisian, and a fourth man whose nationality was not immediately disclosed, said the spokesman, who by custom is not identified. The prosecutor alleges the suspects provided clandestine lodging in Madrid and in a Barcelona suburb, as well as other aid to various fugitives who ""were directly implicated"" in the Madrid train bombings that killed 191 people and wounded more than 1,800, the spokesman said. Spanish courts already have convicted 14 Islamic militants for their roles in the train bombings, along with four Spaniards, the latter for trafficking in explosives used in the attacks. Additionally, seven other prime Islamic suspects in the attacks blew themselves up three weeks after the train bombings as police closed in on their hideout in a Madrid suburb. That explosion also killed a police officer and wounded various others. The seventh anniversary of the train bombings was two weeks ago on March 11. Last February, Spain's Supreme Court overturned a lower court's conviction of five other men for Islamic terrorist activities that included aiding fugitives from the Madrid train bombings and planning other attacks, according to the court order made public March 2. The National Court in January 2010 had convicted the five other men --- three Moroccans, an Algerian and a Turk --- for collaborating or belonging to an Islamic terrorist group and sentenced them to prison terms from five to nine years. But the Supreme Court disagreed, ruling that telephone wiretaps used to gain crucial evidence against those five suspects lacked the proper protections under Spain's constitution, and there was ""insufficient evidence, beyond all reasonable doubt,"" to prove the crimes that prosecutors alleged. Those five men were in a group based in a Barcelona suburb, Santa Coloma de Gramenet, before police made arrests in June 2005. Some of the suspects to go on trial Thursday also allegedly operated their network to aid fugitives from the same Barcelona suburb. The trial is expected to last several days.","Prosecutor says the four aided fugitives from the 2004 Madrid train bombing .

"(CNN) -- Two Rwandan rebel leaders went on trial in Germany on Wednesday on charges of crimes against humanity, war crimes and being members of a foreign terrorist group, a court statement said. Ignace Murwanashyaka, 47, and Straton Musoni, 49, are alleged members of the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR). They are on trial at the Stuttgart high court. The rebel group mainly comprises Hutu extremists who fled to Congo after taking part in the 1994 Rwandan genocide. ""They stand accused of controlling the strategy and tactics of the FDLR from Germany,"" the court said. ""In this capacity they're supposed to have been responsible for 26 crimes against humanity and 39 war crimes"" carried out by their militias in the Democratic Republic of Congo in 2008 and 2009. Human Rights Watch said the trial marks a milestone. ""This trial will be the first in Germany under its Code of Crimes Against International Law, adopted in June 2002, which integrates the crimes of the Statute of the International Criminal Court (ICC) into German criminal law and allows German courts to investigate and prosecute them wherever they are committed in the world, because of their sheer gravity,"" Human Rights Watch said. A third alleged rebel leader, Callixte Mbarushimana, has been transferred to the International Criminal Court to face charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity. Mbarushimana was arrested in Paris in October under an ICC warrant involving allegations of mass rape and other crimes committed in the Democratic Republic of Congo. He is charged with 11 counts of crimes against humanity and war crimes including rape, gender-based persecution and property destruction by his group in 2009, an ICC statement said in October. The ICC statement blamed the group for instigating war in Congo as part of its efforts to topple the government in neighboring Rwanda. Mbarushimana left Rwanda in the aftermath of the war and worked for the United Nations until he was dismissed in 2001 when it was revealed that he was the subject of an investigation by the United Nations' own criminal tribunal for Rwanda. In 2005, CNN spoke with Mbarushimana in France, where he had refugee status. He maintained his innocence. ""I am not afraid of justice. What I am afraid of is injustice, like what is taking place in Rwanda for instance, where people are not really tried properly,"" he said. The ICC said Mbarushimana ""has held senior positions in the political leadership of the FDLR"" since 2004. The ICC, seated at The Hague in the the Netherlands, describes itself on its website as ""the first permanent, treaty based, international criminal court established to help end impunity for the perpetrators of the most serious crimes of concern to the international community.""","Alleged rebel leaders are the first to be tried under a German law passed in 2002 .

"(CNN) -- Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi and some of his sons and closest advisers face investigation for alleged crimes against humanity, International Criminal Court prosecutor Luis Moreno-Ocampo said Thursday. ""I would like to use this opportunity to put them on notice,"" Moreno-Ocampo told CNN. ""I want to be clear: If their troops commit crimes, they could be made criminally responsible."" It is the first time the court will be investigating allegations as an event is ongoing. They include allegations of security forces killing unarmed protesters, forced displacement, illegal detention and airstrikes on civilians. Investigators will look at the most serious accusations in Libya since February 15, the prosecutor said, when demonstrations against Gadhafi ramped up. Moreno-Ocampo provided a map showing the locations where alleged crimes may have been committed. He cautioned, however, that he needed more time to review the evidence. ""This is the beginning of the investigation. I can give no details,"" he said. ""We cannot confirm these allegations that these civilians were bombed by planes. But we have ... confirmation that civilians that were demonstrating were shot by security forces. ""We interview people and we will present the evidence to the judges. The judges will decide who should be prosecuted,"" he said. But Moreno-Ocampo warned that anti-Gadhafi protesters would also be held accountable for criminal activity. ""Now, it's not just civilian demonstrations. Now, there are people opposing Gadhafi with weapons. And also we would like to warn them, you cannot commit crimes. Our business in Libya is (to) stop the crimes,"" he said. The prosecutor will offer Gadhafi and others ""any opportunity they want to provide their own version (of events). Because we have to be impartial. But also, we want to warn the other parties. No one can commit crimes in Libya."" Moreno-Ocampo emphasized it was the first time the ICC was able to respond in real time to allegations, partially due to social-networking sites such as Facebook. ""This triggered a very quick reaction. The (United Nations) Security Council reacted in a few days; the U.N. General Assembly reacted in a few days. So, now because the court is up and running we can do this immediately,"" he said. ""I think Libya is a new world. How we manage the new challenge -- that's what we will see now."" Moreno-Ocampo, who said he plans to finish his investigation within weeks and hopes to have the judge's decision within months, also announced the probe at a press conference Thursday. ""We identified some individuals with a factor of formal authority who have authority on the security forces who allegedly committed the crimes,"" he told reporters. ""They are Moammar Al Gadhafi, his inner circle including some of his sons who have a facto authority, but also there are some people with formal authority that should pay attention to the crimes committed by their people because if they are not preventing stopping and punishing these crimes they could be responsible in accordance with the law. ""They are minister of foreign affairs, the head of the regime security and intelligence, the head of Gadhafi personal security and the head of Libyan external security. So we would like to use this opportunity to put them on notice. If forces under their command commit criminal acts, they could be responsible.""","Prosecutor to probe allegations of killing protesters, illegal detention, airstrikes on civilians .

"Jakarta, Indonesia (CNN) -- Leaders of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations met in Indonesia on Saturday for a two-day summit expected to focus on efforts to achieve economic integration by 2015. The meeting started under the cloud of security issues such as the Thai-Cambodia border conflict. Indonesia, which chairs the summit this year, has been trying to mediate talks between Thailand and Cambodia in their dispute over the ancient Preah Vihear temple. Renewed fighting in the area has prompted displacement of thousands on both sides. Fighting along the turbulent border has raged since last month as the two sides accuse each other of trying to seize ancient temples. Much of the border between the two countries remains in dispute. Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono urged member nations to promote peace. ""We realize that to ensure peaceful and stable east Asia region, we must ensure stability and security in the region,"" he said in his opening speech. ""History recalls that as one of the pioneers of regional integration in the world, ASEAN was established based on the strong desire to establish peace, building consensus, promoting stability through regional cooperation and integration."" Indonesian Foreign Minister Marty Natalegawa met separately with his Thai and Cambodian counterparts on Friday. Last month, both nations agreed to the deployment of an Indonesian observer team to the disputed area, but have not agreed on conditions set by either country. There are no indications so far that the leaders of both nations will meet on the sidelines of the summit. Other issues expected to be discussed is Myanmar's bid to host the summit in 2016, two years before its turn to assume the chairmanship. Human Rights Watch urged ASEAN leaders to reject the proposal. ""Rewarding Burma with ASEAN's chairmanship after it staged sham elections and still holds 2,000 political prisoners would be an embarrassment for the region,"" said Elaine Pearson, deputy Asia director at Human Rights Watch. ""ASEAN leaders need to decide if they will let Burma demote ASEAN to the laughingstock of intergovernmental forums."" Myanmar was formerly known as Burma. The regional group rotates the chairmanship every year among its members: Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam. International pressure forced Myanmar to skip its turn in 2005. Yudhoyono also stressed the need for ASEAN leaders to address the challenges of food and energy security. ""We must give serious attention and take concrete measures to address the soaring of food prices and world energy, which in turn will negatively affect the prosperity of our people,"" he said. ""History shows that the rise of food and energy prices usually caused the increase in the number of people living in poverty.""","Indonesia chairs the summit this year .

"(CNN) -- European and American leaders weighed the pros and cons of arming Libya's rebels Wednesday -- a possibility made more urgent by a series of new military setbacks for forces seeking to topple strongman Moammar Gadhafi. Government forces have been pushing from Bin Jawad to Ras Lanuf, a critical eastern oil town that the opposition seized on Sunday. Gadhafi's military has also launched escalated strikes in the western town of Misrata. The new offensive was launched in the wake of an international arms embargo and air strike campaign designed to establish a no-fly zone and provide humanitarian relief for civilians threatened by the Libyan military. British Prime Minister David Cameron told the House of Commons Wednesday that the United Nations Security Council mandate ""allows all necessary measures to protect civilians and populated areas (and) this would not necessarily rule out provision of assistance to those protecting civilians in certain circumstances."" ""As I've said before, we do not rule it out but we have not taken the decision to do so,"" he said. U.S. President Barack Obama said Tuesday he is also open to the possibility of arming rebel fighters. ""I'm not ruling it out, but I'm also not ruling it in,"" he told NBC. In a separate interview with ABC, Obama said that ""if we wanted to get weapons into Libya, we probably could. ... We're looking at all our options at this point."" One significant problem, however, is the need to train opposition forces on how to use advanced weaponry. ""The notion of the gang that couldn't shoot straight might be lived out,"" retired Maj. Gen. James ""Spider"" Marks told CNN Tuesday night. ""There must be some degree of training associated with arming this force,"" said Marks, a former commanding general of the U.S. Army Intelligence Center. ""However, some weapons systems, clearly they can get a handle on and they can use immediately. It's the more lethal weapon systems that would require training, and I don't think there's time to do that."" Another problem: a possible al Qaeda and Hezbollah presence within Libya's rebel movement. U.S. intelligence has detected evidence of ""flickers"" of al Qaeda and Hezbollah elements among the rebels, according to Adm. James Stavridis, the U.S. NATO commander. Stavridis stressed Tuesday, however, that such a presence appears to be minimal. ""The intelligence that I'm receiving at this point makes me feel that the leadership that I'm seeing are responsible men and women who are struggling against Col. Gadhafi,"" Stavridis told a congressional committee. Stavridis's comments come the same day that U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton met with leaders of Libya's opposition in London. A senior counterterrorism official, unnamed because he is not authorized to speak on the record, backed up Stavridis' assessment, downplaying the concern about al Qaeda among the Libyan opposition. There is probably ""a sprinkling of extremists to perhaps include al Qaeda"" in Libya among the rebels, ""but no one should think the opposition is being led by al Qaeda or one of its affiliates,"" the official said. Al Qaeda has had a presence in North Africa for years. ""It's hard to tell who all the leaders are in the opposition,"" the official said, but ""the rebels do not appear to be adopting an al Qaeda bent or ideology in Libya."" White House Press Secretary Jay Carney told reporters Tuesday that the rebel leaders meeting with Clinton ""made clear what their principles are."" ""We believe that (their principles are) meritorious,"" Carney said.

"Tokyo (CNN) -- The bodies of two Japanese nuclear power plant workers missing since the epic March 11 earthquake and tsunami have been found, an official with the plant's owner said Sunday. The men's remains were found in the basement of the turbine building at the No. 4 reactor at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant, an official with the Tokyo Electric Power Company told reporters Sunday. The pair -- identified as Kazahiko Kokubo, 24, and Yoshiki Terashima, 21, both members of the utility company's operations management department -- were working in that building when the 9.0-magnitude quake and subsequent tsunami struck. The disaster caused damage throughout northeastern Japan, including at the power plant, which is on the Asian nation's eastern coast about 240 kilometers (150 miles) north of Tokyo. One of the workers was found floating in a pool of water in the basement, the utilty company official said. Both appeared to have suffered multiple traumatic injuries and severe blood loss. The bodies were found Wednesday, but the power company did not disclose the news until late Sunday morning. Tokyo Electric officials explained the information was delayed in getting out because it took time to notify victims' families and discuss how to announce the news. Company Chairman Tsunehisa Katsumata offered condolences for ""the loss of two valuable lives."" ""It is deeply regrettable that we lose two employees who were trying to protect the safety of the power plant from the earthquake and tsunami,"" he said in a statement. Later, Katsumata reiterated Tokyo Electric's vow that every effort is being made to address the crisis at the nuclear plant and this such a situation will never happen again. ""We swear never to repeat this tragedy,"" he said, ""and we making a full effort to resolve the situation as soon as possible."" Susan Olson and Yuki Arakawa contributed to this report for CNN.","The two victims, both male, worked for Tokyo Electric and were in their 20s .

"(CNN) -- Floods have devastated the landscape of the state of Queensland, Australia, but they also present a high risk to the Great Barrier Reef. Stretching over 2,300 kilometers (1,430 miles) along the northeast coast of Australia, large parts of the southern Great Barrier Reef are ""flooded"" with fresh water. Currently the biggest plumes of fresh water reach about 200 kilometers (124 miles) north from the mouths of the Fitzroy and Burnett Rivers, and stretch around 70 kilometers (43 miles) off the coast. ""These are extraordinary events. The whole of the inner-shore reef lagoon filled with river water,"" says Jon Brodie, Principle Researcher for the James Cook University's Australian Center for Tropical Freshwater Research. Brodie and his team regularly monitor the reefs and are immersed in studying the impact of the flood waters. Brodie describes the threat to many coral reefs closest to the flooding rivers as ""quite high"" but expects the flood waters to affect in some way the reefs stretching from Frazer Island, 200 kilometers (124 miles) north of Brisbane, all the way to Cairns, 1,500 kilometers (930 miles) away. The prevailing tides and south easterly winds mean the flood waters will probably continue to head north. ""It's quite remarkable to see. If you were to snorkel where the flood water meets the seawater and look to one side, the sea water will be clear with visibility to 50 meters while the other side is fresh, dirty brown water where visibility is down to one meter,"" says Brodie. The mix of nutrients, sediment and pesticides from agricultural run-off, plus currently unknown amounts of trace metals from flooded mines, will likely have an immediately devastating impact on corals and sea grasses, says Brodie. Salinity could go down to ten parts per thousand or less and remain like that for weeks; ""nothing can live in those conditions,"" says Brodie. The immediate death of corals and sea grass is expected, which could then have a devastating affect on other marine creatures like dugongs that feed on sea grass. When the Fitzroy River (that flooded Rockhampton before Christmas) suffered severe flooding in 1991, the corals and sea grasses around the Keppel Islands suffered 100 percent coral mortality. Bigger fishes can swim away from the deluge of fresh water, but smaller coral reef fish may suffer the same fate as the corals they live around, says Brodie. While corals can recover from ""bleaching"" (when coral organisms die leaving what looks like a white skeletal structure), it's a slow process. Some recovery around the Keppel Islands was seen after 10 years, while other coral species and marine organisms were still recovering until the latest floods. Other marine species can actually benefit from floods. ""Some fish species thrive in the current flood plume conditions which can enhance productivity for some popular inshore species,"" Andrew Skeat, General Manager of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority said in a press statement. Other unwanted long term effects can be algae blooms which can upset the reef ecosystems. ""It will take some time before the impacts of these flood plumes on the marine ecosystem and on the industries that use these areas are known,"" said Skeat. Climate scientists have blamed the excessive rainfall the region has seen in the last month on the latest La Niña weather event. La Niña refers to the cooling of the central and eastern Pacific that drives wetter conditions in eastern Australia. Brodie agrees with the cause of the heavy rain: ""It was predicted. It certainly fits the pattern of severe weather events from climate change modeling."" Queensland suffered its wettest ever December, according to the Australian Bureau of Meteorology, during what it describes as a ""very strong"" La Niña event in the Pacific Ocean. In June 2010 the bureau stated that La Niña was likely to have an affect on Australia by the end of that year. A previous La Niña event happened in 1974 when a record flood of the Brisbane River killed 14 people.","Flood water will have devastating affect on corals and sea grass in parts of Great Barrier Reef .

"Coral Gables, Florida (CNN) -- World War II U.S. Navy veteran Tony Snetro doesn't need any help running around the bases. At 93 years of age, he's the oldest member on the ""Young Viejos"" softball team, as well as one of the originals. He was there when the league for players 65 years and older started more than a decade ago in Coral Gables, Florida. ""Little by little, as it built up, we had enough men to make two teams,"" says Snetro. With an average age of close to 80, they're not as fast as they once were. In fact, a few can't even make it out of the batter's box. Some players use a pinch runner once they finally make contact with the ball. One of those players is the starting catcher, Augustin Gonzalez. Bending down is a major challenge for the second-oldest player on the team, and running to first base is certainly out of the question. Still, the 88-year-old backstop shows up for games every Tuesday and Thursday, slowly taking his position behind the plate while his teammates cheer him on. ""If a miracle exists, this is a miracle, because to have people here 80 and 90 years old playing ball, I think that's remarkable,"" says 81-year-old Manny Alvarez. Alvarez had a close call five years ago, suffering a heart attack while playing in the outfield. With two stents in his artery, three months later he was back on the diamond, taking his regular position. Nothing was going to keep him from rejoining his pals. ""We are all blessed,"" Alvarez says quietly. Juan Montes fondly recalls playing alongside former Major Leaguer Cookie Rojas when they were teenagers in Havana, Cuba. Montes' father would tell him that only Rojas had the desire to be a baseball player. ""You don't have that hunger,"" the elder Montes would tell his son. ""Besides, you're too heavy."" The team's name is a mix of English and Spanish and means young old men. Montes, 74, says it's older players like Snetro who inspire him now. ""Tony is a symbol for us to come here,"" Montes says, adding, ""Why should I stay home in bed while there are guys out there?"" That's Snetro's message as well. ""If you feel good, don't just sit in a rocking chair,"" he says. ""Get up and move around! You'd be surprised, by doing this your mind stays sharper."" Snetro's secret to his everlasting youth? ""I eat hot peppers,"" he proudly states. ""Almost every day since I was a kid raised in Connecticut."" The question now is how much longer Snetro can play. ""The good lord knows that number,"" he says with a smile. ""I don't know it. It's up to him."" As he points to the sky, he says, ""Who knows, maybe another year or two."" Snetro looks around the field and jokingly says, ""I gotta play until I'm 100 years old.""","88-year-old outfielder for ""Young Viejos"" says it's a miracle his team can still play .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Mel Gibson's ex-girlfriend dropped her domestic violence accusations against the actor during a court hearing Wednesday morning, according to sources close to both Gibson and Oksana Grigorieva. Grigorieva's lawyer also told a Los Angeles County Superior Court judge she wanted the restraining order that prohibited Gibson from having contact with her lifted, the sources said. Grigorieva had been using the domestic violence accusations in her effort to change the custody arrangement for their child. ""She wanted to demonstrate she's a responsible, good, co-parent and she did this for the sake of the child,"" said a source close to Grigorieva, who asked not to be identified. Lawyers for both sides have not commented publicly about the case, much of which has been sealed by the judge since it involves the custody battle for their young daughter. Gibson entered a ""no contest"" plea in March to a misdemeanor battery charge relating to an incident last year involving Grigorieva. A plea deal put the actor on unsupervised probation for three years and it requires Gibson to complete 52 weeks of anger management counseling. It also allowed him to enter a no contest plea without admitting guilt. Gibson and Grigorieva are in a bitter legal fight over custody of their daughter. The sheriff's investigation findings have been in the hands of prosecutors since August. It was not immediately clear if Grigorieva would continue to pursue a civil suit against Gibson based on the violence accusations. CNN's Jack Hannah contributed to this report.","NEW: ""She did this for the sake of the child,"" a source close to Grigorieva said .

"(CNN)  -- World number two Novak Djokovic extended his winning run in 2011 to 27 matches with a 7-6 6-2 win over Spain's Feliciano Lopez to win the Serbia Open in Belgrade Sunday. It was top seed and home favorite Djokovic's fifth title of the year after his wins at the Australian Open, Dubai, Indian Wells and Miami. The 23-year-old Djokovic is now two wins away from equaling Ivan Lendl's record of a 29-0 winning season start, set in 1986. Rain interrupted the final twice with Djokovic battling it out on home clay for 73 minutes before wrapping up the first set on a tiebreak. The start of the second set was also delayed by rain before Djokovic secured a pair of breaks to wrap up victory. His last defeat came against Roger Federer in the semifinals of the ATP World Tour Finals last November and he closed out 2010 by leading Serbia to the victory in the Davis Cup final on home soil against France. Djokovic is firmly focused on toppling Rafael Nadal as world number one this season. ""I need to stay healthy and I need to stay fit in order to play well. The winning streak is something I don't really think about,"" he told the official ATP Tour website. ""I am flattered that people compare me to the greats, like Lendl, (John) McEnroe, (Roger) Federer, Nadal -- guys who have made history on the tennis court. But I have some other goals to achieve this year. ""Obviously the number one ranking is still far away, even though I've been winning every match I've played this year and won five titles in a row. ""But I know I need to do more and if I ever get to that number one in the world it would be a dream come true for me, because it's been the ambition of my career."" Argentina's Juan Martin del Potro is also in fine form heading into the second grand slam of the season at the French Open later this month and secured his second title of the season with a 6-2 6-2 win over Fernando Verdasco in the final of the Estoril Open Sunday. Del Potro, who is returning to his best after missing most of 2010 with a wrist injury, was claiming his ninth ATP title from 12 final appearances. ""This is a great victory, it's unbelievable to win on clay. It's something I never expected so soon,"" he told AFP. Former world number three Nikolay Davydenko of Russia won the Munich ATP title Sunday with a 6-3 3-6 6-1 victory over Germany's Florian Mayer. It was his 21st ATP title and his first since Doha in January 2010. On the WTA Tour, world number one Caroline Wozniacki began her campaign at the Madrid Masters Sunday with a 6-2 6-3 win over Japan's Ayumi Morita. Maria Sharapova and Francesca Schiavone also went through to the second round at the tournament which also features the ATP Masters 1000 event with  Nadal as top seed.

"(CNN) -- Security concerns forced two U.S. passenger flights to be diverted Sunday, but both planes landed safely and eventually flew to their final destinations. A Continental flight bound for Chicago from Houston made an unscheduled stop in St. Louis because of an ""unruly passenger,"" a St. Louis airport spokesman said Sunday. The man tried to reach the exit door during the flight, but was stopped by a flight attendant, spokesman Jeff Lea said. The plane landed at St. Louis and the man was taken off the plane for questioning by airport police and federal authories, he said. Continental Flight 546 finally landed in Chicago Sunday afternoon just an hour late. A Delta flight was diverted Sunday after a flight attendant found a suspicious note in a lavatory, an official with the Transportation Security Administration told CNN. The flight from Detroit headed to San Diego was diverted to Albuquerque, New Mexico, the FBI said, adding that it was informed of ""a potential security threat"" on the plane. Flight 1706 landed in Albuquerque shortly before 10 a.m. (12 p.m. ET) and agents were on the scene to investigate, the FBI office in Albuquerque said. A spokesman for Albuquerque International Sunport Airport said passengers deplaned and were ""being checked out.""

"(CNN) -- Investigators checked cameras at California-Mexico border crossings Monday in their search for a driver who is believed to have caused a weekend crash that killed five people on a California desert highway. A Dodge Avenger struck a group of 12 motorcycles Saturday on a highway in El Centro, Imperial County, just east of San Diego, after swerving to avoid a gold Honda Civic that had just passed the bikers. Four people on the bikes and a passenger in the Dodge Avenger died on the scene, California Highway Patrol spokeswoman Deeann Goudie said.  Six other motorcyclists were seriously injured. ""The gold Honda Civic left the scene without stopping and police want to talk with that driver,"" Goudie said. ""We're looking for a 1995-2000 model year Gold Honda Civic."" Police suspect the Honda driver may have fled across the nearby border into Mexico, prompting them to take a look at the border camera video, according to another California Highway Patrol spokesman, Pablo Torrez. A drunk driving charge that was initially made against the Dodge Avenger driver was dropped Monday after blood test results came back negative, Torrez said. The bikers are part of the Saddle Tramps Motorcycle group in Lakeside, California. They were taking a casual ride on their Harley Davidsons to celebrate the group's 10th anniversary. Anyone with information is asked to contact the California Highway Patrol.

"(CNN) -- Easter has passed, and you've finally finished cleaning the last of that weird basket-lining ""grass"" from the carpet. Beginning Sunday, millions of Americans can also celebrate the resurrection of their foregone vices -- whatever treat or habit they gave up for 40 long days of Lent. After chocolate and fried foods (pound-droppage is a common additional motive), an increasingly popular thing to give up for Lent is Facebook -- anecdotally, at least. Two of our friends tried it this year, and they both reported the break made them pretty darn happy. Collectively, Facebook's users spend -- wait for it -- 700 billion minutes per month on the site, according to company stats. Assuming the site has 500 million active users (they've hit 600 million but haven't updated the time-use stats on their site, so we're working with what we got -- thanks, Zuckerberg), that works out to 23 hours and 20 minutes per person a month -- on average. An entire day, shoom, out the window, into the sunshine that you are not enjoying because you are clicking, zombie-like, through pictures of that chick from grade school looking sweaty in a maternity suite. Now, the debate rages on: Passionate pundits on either end of the arena argue that Facebook is bringing us closer together, or, alternatively, turning us all into socially inept hermits who smell of Cheetos and squint like little voles. But while we can't stop the churning tides of new technology, we can decide exactly how much time to devote to staring at glowing screens. And we'd like to recommend that, at least for a few weeks, you make that screen-time shrink. With the tulips blazing, the birds singing and the spring breeze losing its chill, now just might be the time to take a break, or at least to set some self-limits (to go from ""in a relationship"" to ""it's complicated"" with the ol' FB, if you will.) Here's the shocking truth: If you stop using Facebook so often, you won't need it so much. See, the whole ""Facebook addict"" trope isn't too far from reality: Recent research in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology suggests that browsing the site is self-reinforcing. Frequent use paradoxically can make us feel disconnected, which we then try to cure by using Facebook even more. In other words, the more you have it, the more you want it. (File that under ""ways FB is like money and sex."") The upshot -- and this is what my Facebook-eschewing friends reported -- is that after a few days away from the site, you kinda forget to miss it. One said that she's now back on the site but using it only to check specific things, instead of burning up hours clicking through 483 wedding photos of that dude from high school whose name she otherwise wouldn't remember. Research backs her up: People are happier when they're checking up on Facebook friends vs. clicking around without a target, according to a study from the University of Missouri. Just, uh, don't let that target be a former flame and his or her adorable new significant other. (Hey, another perk of less Facebook face-time: lower odds of spotting infuriating updates from exes, rivals and frenemies.) Now, if you're thinking about closing your profile down for a spell, know that it will be warm and waiting for you when you want to come back.

Remind your BFFs that you're Facebook-free and the good ones, at least, will know to pop you onto the invite list to their next Kafka-inspired gallery opening/speed hair-cutting contest. What you will miss is another mass invite to that random guy's seventh pathetic open mic performance, during which he'll try a new ending on his jam, ""My Burning Heart Must Be Extinguished.""

"Bath, Maine (CNN) -- Under clear, blue skies, a ship dedicated to fallen Medal of Honor recipient and Navy SEAL Lt. Michael Murphy was christened Saturday by his mother, Maureen, at Bath Iron Works shipyard in Maine. ""I feel not only Michael's presence, but that ship embodies the spirits of Michael and his teammates,"" Murphy's father, Daniel, told CNN. Following tradition, Murphy's mother cracked a bottle of champagne against the hull of the USS Michael Murphy. ""Happy Birthday, son!"" Murphy's mom said on what would have been her son's 35th birthday. His life was cut short in the mountains of Afghanistan in 2005. Dr. Josh Appel, an Air Force Reserve flight surgeon, helped retrieve Murphy's body after a firefight that claimed the lives of 18 other troops, including 2 SEALs from Murphy's team. Appel called the christening ""a symbolic gesture that brings Michael's spirit into the ship."" Murphy's team -- on a mission to go after a Taliban leader -- was ambushed when the troops were outnumbered by Taliban fighters. Murphy was honored for his courage by running into a clearing to call for help despite exposing himself to enemy fire. He was hit with two bullets in his back, but continued to seek help on the call. His final words to his command belied the deadly attack under way: ""Thank you,"" he said. ""We can never repay, but must never ever forget,"" said Sen. Olympia Snowe, R-Maine, in front of more than 2,000 people at the shipyard. The ship's dedication comes during a week of honors for Navy SEALs. Members of the elite special ops force killed Osama bin Laden during a 38-minute operation early Monday in Pakistan. ""You're going to have good days. You're going to have bad days,"" Rear Adm. Garry Bonelli told CNN. ""What we're trying to do is defend freedom and follow out the president's orders. That's what we're all about."" The destroyer will be moved to a dry dock for several months while workers put the final touches on it. The lettering on the stern of the ship doesn't need any more work. It says, ""Michael Murphy,"" but among its admirers, it's already being called ""the Murph.""","USS Michael Murphy named for Medal of Honor recipient .

"(CNN) -- Heavy rains and flooding in Brazil have caused 260 deaths in the states of Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo, CNN affiliate TV Record reported Wednesday. The greatest damage was in a cluster of towns in a mountainous area northeast of the city of Rio from Tuesday night to Wednesday morning, where civil defense officials said 147 lost their lives. That included 114 people reported killed in Teresopolis by a mudslide, local officials told CNN. Some 1,000 others were left without shelter and were being moved to a local gym and schools. And, in nearby Petropolis, 18 deaths were recorded, the state government said, according to Agencia Brasil. Three deaths were reported in Itaipava, while in Nova Friburgo there were 12. Among the victims in Rio state were three firefighters who were involved in rescue operations when they were buried by a subsequent mudslide, Agencia Brasil reported. A fourth firefighter was missing. Nearly 75,000 people were without power in the region as a result of the heavy storms. Teresopolis Mayor Jorge Mario Sedlacek declared his city a natural disaster area. He told CNN affiliate TV Globo that at least 80 rescuers have been sent to the region. Meanwhile, in the state of Sao Paulo, at least 24 people were dead as heavy rain continued to batter parts of the state, authorities said. It has been raining since January 1, and the deluge could continue until the end of the week, forecasters have said. The flooding has caused mudslides, officials said Tuesday. The Mairipora Dam gave way, adding to the woes in the area, said Ramos Junior, a captain at the Sao Paulo Civil Fire Department. Sao Jose dos Campos, about 100 kilometers (62 miles) from the city of Sao Paulo, has been hardest hit by the flooding, Junior said. In January last year, heavy rains caused dozens of deaths in Brazil's southeast coast. Torrential rains caused deadly mudslides in the resort area of the town of Angra dos Reis. Journalist Luciani Gomes and CNN's Marilia Brocchetto, Rafael Romo and Mariano Castillo contributed to this report.","NEW: There are 147 reported deaths in state of Rio de Janeiro .

"(Mashable) -- Pandora has expanded from music to jokes with the addition of 10,000 comedy clips from more than 700 comedians to its Internet radio service. Like its Music Genome Project, Pandora's Comedy Genome Project analyzes the content of each clip for style, content and deliver in order to figure out which comedians have similar delivers or joke about similar topics. It's this analysis and recommendation system that has turned Pandora into a Internet music powerhouse. ""Adding comedians to the mix has been one of the top requests from our listeners,"" Pandora said in a blog post, ""so we've taken the same approach to comedy as we have to music: carefully and deliberately analyzing comedic 'bits' across a very large number of attributes to capture the style, delivery and content of each performance."" Some of the comedians that are now available on Pandora include Chris Rock, Jerry Seinfeld, Eddie Murphy, George Carlin, Mitch Hedberg and John Rivers, according to The New York Times. And like its musical counterpart, comedy on Pandora will also come with audio advertisements. Unilever is Pandora's first advertiser and will be promoting its Axe male body products and Klondike bars. Once at the brink of destruction, Pandora has bounced back and is now preparing for an IPO that is expected to raise at least $100 million for the Internet radio company.

THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED. MRS. LONG'S STUDENTS: We're from Twin Rivers High School in Broseley, Missouri. Start your tractor, Carl! CARL AZUZ, CNN STUDENT NEWS ANCHOR: We thank Mrs. Long's students in Missouri for getting today's show revved up and ready to go. And we thank all of you for checking out this Thursday edition of CNN Student News. First Up: Changing Strategy . AZUZ: I'm Carl Azuz, and first up today, we have a report from CNN's Chris Lawrence on the conflict in Libya. The U.S. has been involved in this since March 19th, when it launched missiles at targets inside the North African country. But the military strategy is shifting. (BEGIN VIDEO) CHRIS LAWRENCE, CNN PENTAGON CORRESPONDENT: U.S. officials say they're not in Libya to help rebels win a war. VICE ADMIRAL BILL GORTNEY, DIRECTOR OF THE JOINT STAFF: That's not part of our mandate. LAWRENCE: But the coalition is launching missiles at specific units, like the headquarters of Libya's elite 32nd Brigade. GORTNEY: This is one of Gadhafi's most loyal units. LAWRENCE: The coalition has interpreted ""protect civilians"" to mean it can destroy any weapons Gadhafi could use. Air strikes hit munitions depots in two cities. GORTNEY: Any place that we can see ammunition storage facilities, things of that nature, that, we're going after those. LAWRENCE: A mission that started with preventing attacks from the air is now focused, not even two weeks later, on destroying targets on the ground. New flying gunships like the A-10 have replaced some of the ships that were firing cruise missiles. These new aircraft fly low, closer to a target, and shoot machine gun fire instead of dropping thousand-pound bombs. They're designed to fight in and around cities, where rebels are trying to hold off Gadhafi's forces. On Tuesday, the NATO commander said that protecting civilians mandate extends all the way into Tripoli itself. ADMIRAL JAMES STAVRIDIS, NATO SUPREME ALLIED COMMANDER, EUROPE: I think that any Gadhafi forces that are demonstrating hostile intent against the Libyan population are legitimate targets. LAWRENCE: So far, the assault has cost the Pentagon well over half a billion dollars. But most of that money came from cruise missiles and other munitions. The strategy has shifted, and now the U.S. forces are focused on refueling planes, jamming communication and striking Gadhafi forces. So, the military only expects to spend $40 million over the next few weeks. And a spokeswoman says, ""After that, we would incur added costs of about $40 million per month."" How many months? It's hard to tell. SEN. JOHN MCCAIN, (R) ARIZONA: But a stalemate is not an acceptable solution. STAVRIDIS: I think a stalemate is not in anybody's interest. (END VIDEO) Libya Civil War . AZUZ: Some rebel leaders in Libya are calling the battles' front lines ""fluid."" They made some advances, took control of some key cities. But Colonel Gadhafi's forces have pushed back. And yesterday, the rebels withdrew from some territory they had taken over before. One strategy that coalition military leaders are considering is arming the rebels, giving them weapons. President Obama has said he's open to this idea, and some experts think it could give rebels help in fighting government forces. But there are also some concerns about this, arming the rebels. U.S. intelligence indicates that some terrorists may be fighting on the side of the rebels. So of course, officials don't want to be giving weapons to the wrong people. Shoutout . PAT ST. CLAIRE, CNN STUDENT NEWS: Today's Shoutout goes out to Mrs. Feller's students at Hardin Intermediate School in Hardin, Montana! On this map of the Middle East, which country is Syria? You know what to do! Is it: A, B, C or D? You've got three seconds -- GO! On this map, B is Syria, a country that's home to more than 22 million people. That's your answer and that's your Shoutout! Syria Unrest . AZUZ: Syria is another country in that part of the world that's dealing with political unrest. Dozens of people have been killed over the last few weeks in fighting between Syrian security forces and protesters who are speaking out against their government. The protesters, here's what they want: changes to Syria's constitution and the end of an emergency law that's been in place in Syria for decades. Yesterday, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad spoke to his country about this unrest. He said he recognizes that Syrians want reform and acknowledges that the government hasn't met the needs of the Syrian people. But President al-Assad also referred to an anti-Syria ""conspiracy,"" and said his country won't fall like others that have gone through revolutions recently, like Egypt, for example. One thing President al-Assad didn't address was that emergency law that protesters want lifted. 9/11 Hearing . AZUZ: It's been nearly 10 years since the 2001 terrorist attacks on the United States. After those attacks, Congress created the 9/11 Commission. The goal was to investigate the country's counterterrorism policy and to give recommendations for how to help avoid future attacks. A U.S. Senate committee is holding hearings to discuss how prepared the U.S. is for another possible attack. Yesterday, they heard the opinions of some members of that 9/11 Commission who said that, in many ways, the U.S. is safer today from that kind of terrorist attack. But they also had a warning: They said the threat of terrorism has changed. The commission's chairman said, ""Although a devastating 9/11-type attack we believe is less likely, the threat is more complex and it's more diverse than at any time in the last decade."" What's the Word? TOMEKA JONES, CNN STUDENT NEWS: What's the Word? It's a term that advertisers use to describe a group of people who share similar characteristics, such as age . DEMOGRAPHIC . That's the word! TVs Watching You? AZUZ: Advertisers use those demographics to decide which ads to show to which people. For example, if you're trying to promote an action movie, advertisers believe they're better off showing that to a younger, male audience than to an older, female audience. Deborah Feyerick is looking at new technology that doesn't just let advertisers target a specific group. It lets them target specific individuals. (BEGIN VIDEO) DEBORAH FEYERICK, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Every time you watch TV, your TV is likely watching you through that box which collects information on show after show after show. All that data sent anonymously, ultimately to advertisers, focused on reaching people likely to buy certain products or watch certain shows. What is the benefit to people like me? To consumers? JON WERTHER, PRESIDENT, SIMULMEDIA INC.: The benefit to consumers is that you get more relevant ads and you have fewer ads that are irrelevant to you that are cluttering up your TV experience. FEYERICK: John Werther of Simulmedia successfully helped pioneer targeted advertising on the Internet. Now, he's doing it with TV. If this is done right, how much money is this worth to advertisers? WERTHER: We think billions. Billions of dollars. FEYERICK: Why? Because what you watch tells a lot about you, sometimes unexpectedly. WERTHER: A rerun of ""Saved by the Bell ""at 9:00 a.m. on Saturday morning has been one of the most highly effective spots in driving, let's say, audiences to a crime drama several days later. FEYERICK: It's not just set box data, but your other personal data collected when you ask for credit reports or use retail discount cards. Tech companies like Visible World use this data like direct mail, and can now deliver different ads to different households watching the same program. How does the box know which of these four different ads to get to you? SETH HABERMAN, CEO, VISIBLE WORLD: So, we've built a database that talks to Cablevision and sends out these little messages so the set-top boxes switch at the right time to show the right ads in your household. FEYERICK: As for privacy, Ad Age writer Brian Steinberg says it's a tradeoff. BRIAN STEINBERG, ADVERTISING AGE: That's becoming, you know, kind of the new tipping point of how much information we want to give out there and how much will advertisers use to kind of know where we are, where we're walking, what we like, what we don't like, what our preferences are in exchange for more relevant, more interesting advertising.

"Kampala, Uganda (CNN) -- A violent reaction by Ugandan authorities to ongoing protests against high food prices has put a spotlight on President Yoweri Museveni's 25-year rule over the East African country and raised the fear of a return to the brutal days of Idi Amin. Museveni's various police units and military are deployed around the country to keep a watchful eye on an increasingly impatient nation. With pistols and AK-47s, men wearing uniforms in various shades of blue can be seen on every street corner and sidewalk in the capital, Kampala. It's extremely confusing for a visitor to determine their purposes. Locals explain that the ""Black Mambas"" are special forces, sometimes called the presidential guard, while riot police wear a dark blue uniform. Sporting red berets are the military police, the ones people say are notorious for using live ammunition on civilians. Several other units wear various camouflage uniforms. The ones in khaki are the ""proper police,"" people say. At least 10 people have been killed in Uganda in recent weeks as these various government security forces quash what many have described as one of the biggest challenges yet to Museveni's rule. In a recent television interview, the 66-year-old leader scoffed at suggestions his administration is behaving like that of former dictator Idi Amin, whose 1971-1979 regime was known for massive human rights violations. ""Do you know what Amin used to do?"" he asked the interviewer. ""Murder them and throw them in (the) River Nile for the crocodiles. I have not heard of (Kizza) Besigye's body floating for the crocodiles to eat."" Besigye is the president's former physician turned bitter political rival who since April 11 has been leading a ""walk to work"" campaign against the rising cost of living. He was brutally arrested late last week in Kampala. Policemen, some in plain clothes, armed with pistols and AK-47s, broke Besigye's car window and sprayed him with copious amounts of pepper spray before pushing him into the back of a police truck. It was the fourth time in three weeks he has been arrested. He was later let out on bail, and was in need of medical attention. That evening, independent news channel NTV broadcast the whole episode to the nation. The next morning local papers, including the government-controlled media, led with the story. The reaction was swift, fierce and chaotic. While driving downtown on Friday morning, a group of journalists suddenly heard in the distance the sound of shooting -- rubber bullets, it turned out -- and saw hoards of people run for cover. ""The people are unhappy about what happened to Besigye,"" a local journalist remarked. As the bells of Westminster Abbey in London tolled in anticipation of Catherine Middleton's arrival to marry Prince William in what was labeled the fairytale wedding of the century, Kampala and its surroundings were boiling. Fearless protesters barricaded roads, confronting police in a clear display of anger at what many see as unnecessary brutality against a man who is simply highlighting the plight of all Ugandans. By the time the prince had kissed his new bride for the second time, four Ugandans were dead, some 200 were injured and more than 300 were behind bars. Such scenes have been playing out in Uganda for weeks and the situation appears to be escalating. Museveni blames the food crisis on drought and high oil prices, while Besigye believes the mismanagement of the country's economy over the past quarter of a century is at the core of the problem. Since Museveni's National Resistance Army seized power in 1986, Uganda has seen relative peace and economic growth. The country is the third-strongest economy in East Africa after Kenya and Tanzania. But Museveni, once seen as a new brand of African leader by the West, has over the years tightened his grip on power. He changed the constitution that limited presidential terms to two so he could run for a third term, and then a fourth one this year. His military and police are on standby waiting to crush any sign of dissent or rebellion. Some have predicted an Egyptian-style revolution in Uganda. It was, after all, economic circumstances that lit the splinter that became the uncontainable bonfire some call the North Africa revolution. Whether Uganda could be next remains to be seen. So far, the violent response to the protests has not appeared to deter a people who say they are fed up with poverty for the majority and prosperity for a few.","Protests against food prices in Uganda are being met with violence .

"(CareerBuilder) -- The C-suite has long been thought of as a ""boys' club"" ... and for good reason. In 2010, only 15 of the companies on the Fortune 500 list were headed by women. Additionally, nonprofit research firm Catalyst Inc. reported that overall, women held about 14.4 percent of the executive officer positions at Fortune 500 companies last year, and according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, women make up just 25.4 percent of chief executives nationwide. While these stats are certainly better than they were just 15 years ago -- in 1996, only one Fortune 500 company had a female CEO -- there's still plenty of room left for women in the C-suite. Got your eye on an executive role? Here are some tips on how to get there, from female leaders with first-hand experience. Find a mentor(s): One of the best ways to become a great leader is by learning from others who do it well. ""It is helpful for a woman seeking entry into C-Suite positions to have an advocate in the organization,"" says Susan Bulkeley Butler, who was the first female partner at management consulting firm Accenture and now serves as the CEO of the Susan Bulkeley Butler Institute for the Development of Women Leaders. ""Women need to have mentors and people who help them get the right roles and responsibilities. It's important to have a team to help get to where you want to be."" Equally as important is finding personal role models -- people whose experiences you can learn from, but who may not be formal mentors. ""Women must talk to people that they respect and role models who may be in the type of positions they seek. It's critical to listen to how they developed their careers and how they became the leaders,"" Bulkeley Butler says. Don't fixate on gender: While it can be tough to do, try to look at your work environment as being ""gender neutral,"" suggests Elizabeth Sobol, managing director at IMG Artists. ""There are certainly times when I have run into brick walls that have made me want to yell 'boys' club!' But I have tried as much as possible to resist that temptation,"" she says. ""I have tried to look at each situation and think through what I could be doing better to demonstrate my capabilities and my credentials for each opportunity. I am not suggesting that there is no discrimination out there. But I find that the best way to break through prejudices and discrimination is to keep your focus, maintain your vision -- and just shine."" Don't worry about pleasing everyone: Women tend to be ""people pleasers,"" which can be tough in a workplace setting when, inevitably, decisions need to be made that won't make everyone happy. But in order to reach the executive level in your career, you need to learn to stick to your guns. ""Women are too quick to apologize even when they didn't do anything wrong,"" says Jessica Kleiman, vice president of public relations at Hearst Corporation and co-author of ""Be Your Own Best Publicist."" ""Stand behind your decisions. Understand that not everyone is going to like you. If you can come to terms with that, you'll be less apt to want to please everyone and more likely to fight for your beliefs,"" she says. Be willing to work hard: Getting to the C-suite is an ambitious goal for anyone, male or female, so you'll have to be willing to put in the work to get there. ""The first rule is simply to get an A+ on everything you do,"" Sobol says. ""[As a manager], it is very rare that I will miss someone who is operating at that level on a consistent basis. And those are the people I am going to be looking for to fill higher level positions."" Echoes Bulkeley Butler, ""The most important message I received was: You have to do the position you want before your get there. I hand to perform like a partner before I was promoted."" Focus on your life outside of work, too: Working hard doesn't mean your personal life has to fall by the wayside. Women are more apt to make life outside of work (children, families, friends, hobbies) a priority, and that's OK. A rich personal life can actually make you a better leader. ""Women, in general, tend to look at life in a more holistic way,"" Sobol says. ""I know is that my life is much richer for all the things I experience that have nothing to do with my corporate performance or positioning -- books and nature and art and family. In fact, I think that because I have chosen a more holistic path, I have gained the skills and the fullness I've needed to become a better leader."" Use your ""natural"" advantages: There are certain leadership qualities that women inherently possess, so play up these strong points in your rise to the top. ""By nature, women are nurturing, and able to multitask and problem solve,"" says Meryl Weinsaft Cooper, managing director at DeVries Public Relations and co-author (with Kleiman) of ""Be You Own Best Publicist."" ""Those qualities can make for a very good leader."" Kaitlin Madden is a writer and blogger for CareerBuilder.com. &copy CareerBuilder.com 2010. All rights reserved.

"(CNN) -- The intentional breach of a levee on the Mississippi River is helping to ease unprecedented flood pressure on other areas, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers said. The Ohio River level had dropped about 1.7 feet at Cairo, Illinois, since Monday afternoon, before the blast, but that is expected to level off Wednesday. The breach, created when engineers detonated explosives late Monday night at Birds Point, Missouri, is sending 396,000 cubic feet of water per second onto 200 square miles of fertile Missouri farmland. The water is coursing across a floodway that Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon described as ""literally the most productive part of our continent."" Two states grapple with rising floodwaters . Farmer Bryan Feezor said the sight makes you ""sick to your stomach"" as he surveyed his submerged fields. ""Farming is all I ever have done ... and it's under water,"" he told CNN affiliate KPLR. ""I really don't know (what I'm going to do)."" A second levee blast was conducted Tuesday afternoon at New Madrid, Missouri, and a third is planned Wednesday near Hickman, Kentucky. The second and third blasts, downstream of Birds Point, will allow floodwater to return to the Mississippi River. While the plan appeared to be working -- the level of the Ohio River fell where it joins the Mississippi -- record crests and relentless pressure from millions of gallons of water still threatened communities throughout the Mississippi and Ohio river valleys. Vicksburg, Mississippi, could see water levels rise 4 feet by Sunday. Authorities told residents of Caruthersville, Missouri, that sandbags may not be enough to control the water. Corina Jolley, of Sikeston, Missouri, said she grew up in Dorena, Missouri, which she said was being inundated by the breach on the Mississippi River. A tombstone rests above the remains of her father and uncle, but ""I'm sure we'll never see it again,"" said Jolley, who said residents of the rich farmland will be out of luck, as opposed to those in Cairo, for whom the risk has been lessened by the breaches. ""Whoever thought it would be this bad?"" she said. The situation was especially perilous for a 93-year-old woman who was caught in the swollen waters of the Black River near Poplar Bluff, Missouri, where two members of the Missouri National Guard rescued her from a partially submerged car. ""We weren't there to be heroes,"" said Sgt. Tim Bridges. ""We were just doing our jobs."" Bridges, along with Spc. Junior Bombard, waded through the rushing, muddy waters to ferry the woman to safety. This ""is the reason why I signed up for the Guard,"" said Spc. Junior Bombard. The town of Cairo remained under a mandatory evacuation despite the intentional breach, while six other communities were under voluntary evacuation notices, said Patti Thompson, spokeswoman for the Illinois Emergency Management Agency. ""We're definitely not out of the woods yet,"" she said. ""The levees are all very saturated right now and they're going to continue to have a lot of pressure on them for several days."" Even with the levee breach, the National Weather Service continues to predict record or near-record flooding in parts of southern Illinois, southwest Indiana, western Kentucky and Tennessee, southeastern Missouri, northeastern Arkansas, and parts of Mississippi and Louisiana. Maj. Gen. Michael Walsh, commander of the Corps' Mississippi River Valley Division, made the decision to order the breach. He warned that without punching a hole in the levee, massive flooding would threaten to inundate communities throughout the Mississippi and Ohio river valleys. ""There's a tremendous amount of pressure on the system,"" he told reporters Tuesday evening. ""The project operated as designed."" It was a controversial decision. Missouri officials took the Corps to court over the plan, questioning the agency's authority to intentionally breach the levee. The state argued the floodwater would deposit silt on the estimated  130,000 acres, and years, along with millions of dollars, would be required to fix the damage. The U.S. Supreme Court declined to intervene in the case on Sunday, clearing the way for Walsh to blow the levee. Some Missouri residents were angered by the decision, saying it would destroy their communities and provide questionable benefit. But others felt the decision was for the best. ""Yeah, we lost ... acres of farm land here in Missouri,"" said Sikeston, Missouri, resident Patricia Mobely, who recently fled the drought and firestorms of Texas for what she thought would be a more peaceful life in the Midwest. ""But how much more would we have lost if we hadn't done it?"" ""The sacrifice that these people are making is for the greater good,"" Jim Pogue with the Army Corps of Engineers told KPLR. ""Their sacrifices are going to benefit hundreds of thousands of people all through this region. It's not just Cairo. It's people all through this part of the country."" Walsh called the decision to inundate the farmland and about 100 homes ""heart-wrenching."" ""I've been involved with flooding for 10 years and it takes a long time to recover from something like this,"" he said. CNN's Phil Gast contributed to this report.","Farmer says the sight of his submerged farm makes you ""sick to your stomach""

"(CNN) -- The health of legendary golfer Seve Ballesteros has taken a turn for the worse, his family revealed on Friday. The 54-year-old had a brain tumor removed in late 2008, more than a year after he ended his illustrious career in the sport. ""The Ballesteros family informs that Seve's neurological condition has suffered a severe deterioration,"" read a statement on the Spaniard's website. ""The family will inform accordingly about any change in his health condition and takes this opportunity of thanking everyone for the support that both Seve and his own family have been receiving during all this time."" CNN contacted Ballesteros' office in Santander to ask if he had returned to hospital, but was told that no further information would be given outside his personal website. The news came during the Spanish Open in Barcelona, one of the European Tour's founding events and a tournament that Ballesteros won in 1981 and 1985. Ballesteros met with his close friend and former European Ryder Cup teammate Jose Maria Olazabal before it teed off this week, according to the UK Press Association. ""Seve's physical condition was not good when Jose Maria went to see him, but they talked about golf and everything,"" Olazabal's manager Sergio Gomez told PA on Friday. ""Then came the call yesterday to tell him that Seve was in a critical condition."" Tennis star Rafael Nadal paid tribute to his ailing compatriot on Friday. ""Seve is a great benchmark for all the Spanish athletes who have been fortunate to meet him and play golf with him. I wish him well,"" the world number one said in quotes reported by AFP. ""Life is cruel sometimes, he's had a struggle in recent years but he's still been able to do things. His foundation is an example for society and all athletes."" Ballesteros made his name when he finished second at the British Open as a 19-year-old in 1976 and that year went on to win the European Tour's money list for the first of six times. He won the British Open -- one of golf's four major tournaments -- three times, and was twice victor at the Masters in Augusta. His triumph at the 1979 British Open made him the youngest winner of the event that century and the first non-British European to do so since 1907. As well as his success in stroke play tournaments, Ballesteros was also a mighty competitor in the match play format -- winning the world title five times and helping Europe claim the Ryder Cup on four occasions against the United States. He was also a victorious captain in 1997, the first year that the teams event was hosted by Europe outside of Britain and Ireland. Meanwhile, South Africa's Thomas Aiken claimed a one-shot lead at the halfway stage of the Spanish Open on Friday. The 27-year-old, seeking his first victory on the European Tour, shot his second successive four-under-par 68 at El Prat with a birdie at his final hole for the second day in a row. Ranked 104th in the world, he ended the day ahead of Spain's Pablo Larrazabal, who carded 70 on his home course. ""I belong to another generation and never actually saw Seve play, but his fight these last years has been an inspiration for us all,"" Larrazabal, 27, told the European Tour website. ""Although I was too young to watch him perform when he was at the top, I have seen all his films, and he was really spectacular, never giving up, hitting his driver and chasing the ball into the hole from everywhere."" Another home hope, Alvaro Velasco, fired a flawless 66 to be on six-under 138 alongside France's Romain Wattel (71), Englishman Anthony Wall (70) and first-round leader Scott Jamieson (72). Miguel Angel Jimenez, a non-playing Ryder Cup assistant to Ballesteros in 1997, was tied for 27th on 143, while Olazabal was another shot back after also carding 72.","Seve Ballesteros' condition has deteriorated, according to his family .

"(CNN) -- Three more teenagers admitted Thursday that they took part in bullying a 15-year-old schoolmate who subsequently committed suicide, a Massachusetts prosecutor said. But, as was the case the day before with two other teens involved in the hazing of Phoebe Prince, the more serious charges were dismissed and none of them will serve jail time. Ashley Longe and Flannery Mullins, 18, and Sharon Velazquez, 17, admitted to sufficient facts on charges related to the harassment of Prince, who hanged herself in the stairwell of her parents' apartment in South Hadley on January 14, 2010, after weeks of ridicule and teasing at the hands of classmates, prosecutors said. On the day she died, Prince had endured a torrent of verbal abuse that began at the school library that continued as she walked home from school in tears, prosecutors said. Franklin-Hampshire Juvenile Court Judge Daniel Swords accepted admissions from Longe and Velazquez on charges of criminal harrassment, a misdemeanor, and continued their cases without a finding until their next birthdays. Conditions of their probations include prohibitions on contacting the dead girl's family or profiting from the case, and community service with at-risk or underprivileged youth. Longe was also ordered to work toward completion of her GED. Flannery Mullins, 18, admitted to sufficient facts on a civil rights misdemeanor charge and disturbance of a school assembly, said prosecution spokeswoman Mary Eliza Carey. The judge accepted her admission in a recommendation that the civil rights charge be continued without a finding until her next birthday. She, too, will have probation until her next birthday and will be required to perform community service. Both Velazquez and Longe were charged with civil rights violation with bodily injury and disturbing a school assembly in addition to the criminal harassment charges.  Longe also was charged with assault with a dangerous weapon. Mullins also was charged with criminal harassment and stalking. All of those charges were dismissed. ""The defendants in these five cases have accepted responsibility for their actions and admitted that they engaged in criminal conduct toward Phoebe Prince in the weeks, days and hours before she took her life,"" said David Sullivan, district attorney for the Northwestern District, said in a statement. A charge of disturbing a school assembly is to be continued without a finding for three months as long as she has no contact with the victim's family, does not profit from the case while on probation, performs 100 hours of community service with at-risk or underprivileged youths and works toward obtaining her GED, Carey said. On Wednesday, two other classmates, Sean Mulveyhill and Kayla Narey, entered guilty pleas on criminal harassment charges in Hampshire Superior Court, where the 18-year-olds were charged as adults. They each received one year of probation with stipulations similar to those meted out on Thursday in juvenile court. Narey had also faced charges of civil rights violation resulting in bodily injury and disturbing a school assembly; Mulveyhill, who had dated Prince, had faced similar charges, plus statutory rape. Those charges were dismissed. A criminal charge against a sixth defendant, 19-year-old Austin Renaud, was dismissed Thursday afternoon at the request of Prince's family ""and in the interests of justice,"" Sullivan said. On the day she died, Prince was loudly berated in the South Hadley High School library. She was taunted again as school let out, and as she walked home crying, one of the students called Prince names and tossed an empty can at her from a car, according to the 38-page court filing. By 4:55 p.m. that day, she had hanged herself. Court documents show that, the day before she died, she told a friend, ""School has been close to intolerable lately."" Prosecutors said Prince, who had moved to Massachusetts from Ireland earlier in the school year, had gone out with boys who also dated two of her alleged tormentors, who in retaliation called her names, including ""whore"" and ""Irish slut."" According to prosecutors, the tormenting began when Mulveyhill returned to his former girlfriend, Narey. According to CNN affiliate WWLP, prosecutors said Mulveyhill encouraged Velazquez, Long and Mullins to relentlessly harass Prince. Court documents say Longe threw an energy drink at Prince and screamed at her. Mullins allegedly threatened to beat Prince. In court on Thursday, the assistant district attorney said that Prince had missed classes out of fear that Mullins would harm her. A witness is quoted in a court document as telling investigators, ""She definitely didn't want to fight with the girls in the school. She just wanted to keep to herself and keep things the way they were. She wanted people to stop picking on her, to stop being bullied. She wanted people to leave her alone. She wanted people to stop spreading rumors and stop the girls from talking about her."" Darby O'Brien, a friend of Prince's family, said Wednesday that students should not have to bear ""all of the weight and all of the blame"" for Prince's death. ""They were kids in high school; kids do things out of whack,"" he said. ""But no one has held the professionals -- from the superintendent to principal on down -- (responsible) for what happened as well."" South Hadley Public Schools Superintendent Gus Sayer has defended school administrators' handling of the matter, saying Prince had not told anyone about her situation. He said school officials began to take action when teachers saw the bullying themselves and heard about it from other students. Sullivan said the prosecution ""signifies that bullying and harassment will not be tolerated in our schools; and when it rises to the level of criminal conduct, as it did in these five cases, those responsible will be prosecuted."" As a result of this and another case, the Massachusetts Legislature passed a bullying prevention law that requires schools to train staff and devise a system for reporting and responding to complaints of bullying. CNN's Brian Vitagliano and Chris Boyette contributed to this report.","Five teenagers have now admitted involvement in the bullying case .

"(CNN) -- Braga will face Portuguese rivals Porto in the Europa League final in Dublin on May 18, after beating Benfica 1-0 to scrape through on the away goals rule. Meanwhile, Porto comfortably secured their place in the final 7-4 on aggregate, despite losing 3-2 at Villarreal in the second leg of their semifinal encounter. Benfica had beaten Braga to the Portuguese title last season, and held a narrow 2-1 advantage from the first leg in Lisbon. However, that lead disappeared in the 19th minute when Braga scored what proved to be the only goal of the game. Hugo Viana's out-swinging corner from the left was met perfectly by Custudio, who out-jumped the visiting defenders to power home a bullet header. Benfica fought back and were inches from drawing level in the 42nd minute when Javier Saviola fired Oscar Cardozo's low center against the post. As the match went on, Benfica got closer and closer to scoring. Saviola just failed to convert a flicked-on corner from close range, Alan Kardec's back-post header with two minutes remaining was cleared off the line. But Braga, who were one of the teams that came down from the Champions League after the group stages, held on to reach their first ever European final. Meanwhile, Colombian striker Radamel Falcao broke Jurgen Klinsmann's record for most goals in a European season, as he notched his 16th goal as Porto comfortably secured their final place. The new Portuguese champions hammered their Spanish opponents 5-1 in the first match, making the second leg appear a formality, but Villarreal gave themselves early hope by going ahead in the 17th minute when Cani slotted home after a one-two with Marco Ruben. But the visitors levelled before half-time thanks to a deflected 25-yard strike from Hulk, and Falcao gave Porto the lead five minutes after the break, slotting home Fredy Guarin's pass from the left. However, Villarreal came back into the match and won on the night thanks to a volley from Joan Capdevila and a Giuseppe Rossi penalty after Nicolas Otamendi had fouled Ruben in the area.","Portuguese rivals Porto and Braga will face each other in the Europa League final .

"London (CNN) -- When British economist Jim O'Neill coined the term BRIC at the turn of the century -- referring to Brazil, Russia, India and China, countries he predicted would be future economic powerhouses -- it was difficult to imagine how big an impact the acronym would have. In the following years, the four BRIC countries formed a federation that has met annually since 2009 to discuss their role in the global economy. ""Who would have ever dreamt that there would be a BRIC political club? It certainly isn't something that I ever imagined,"" O'Neill, now chairman of Goldman Sachs Asset Management, told CNN's Nima Elbagir. The BRIC partnership took a new turn last December when its four members invited South Africa to join them at their third heads-of-states summit, to be held in Beijing this month. But the news of the formal invitation, which came after persistent lobbying by the South African government, has left some economists puzzled. According to O'Neill, South Africa's economy of about $350 billion can't come close to matching the prospects of the BRIC countries, which account for about half of global growth. ""It is nowhere near constituting a BRIC, and without staggering productivity improvements and major immigration or improvements in birth rates, etc., it is never going to get there,"" said O'Neill. Some analysts argue that South Africa is simply too small to join the group of the world's top-four major emerging markets. Its population of about 50 million cannot be compared to the BRIC nations, which represent around 40% of the world's people. But South African officials have said that it is the country's strategic importance that matters and not its size. In December 2010, following the BRIC nations' invitation, South Africa's minister of international relations and cooperation Maite Nkoana-Mashabane said: ""The rationale for South Africa's approach was in consideration of a matter of crucial importance to BRIC's member states -- namely the role of emerging economies in advancing the restructuring of the global political, economic and financial architecture into one that is more equitable, balanced and rests on the important pillar of multilateralism."" O'Neill said: ""South Africa has played on the notion that because they do have developed markets and Western governing standards in some areas they've said 'look, we are the gateway to the rest of Africa.'"" He said this argument had some legitimacy but added that it would be interesting to see how it would resonate with the rest of the countries on the continent. ""What intrigues me is whether other big African countries accept that and I doubt that Nigeria is going to be very happy about that,"" O'Neill said. ""In the context of the continent, Nigeria is the place that really matters,"" he added, pointing to the country's 155 million population. Nigeria has been identified by Goldman Sachs as one of the nations that constitute the ""Next 11"" group -- a phrase used to describe the 11 most-populous countries from the emerging world after the BRIC block (besides Nigeria, these are Mexico, Egypt, Turkey, Iran, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Indonesia, Vietnam, South Korea and the Philippines). O'Neill says that within that group, there are four countries that could potentially join the BRIC block. ""Korea, Turkey, Indonesia, and Mexico are big enough to stand on their own feet and are increasingly similar economies to the so-called advanced ones of the four BRICs,"" he said. When asked whether the BRIC label would bring with it a huge degree of international investment interest for South Africa, O'Neill remained cautious. ""Being part of the BRIC political club doesn't guarantee that you are going to be regarded as a BRIC economically,"" he said. ""At this particular point in time, just because South Africa has been accepted into that club doesn't change the way that I'll think about it in terms of how we focus on what constitutes a BRIC or not and whether it affects others in terms of investment flows."" But O'Neill is not entirely negative. He urges South African leaders to be bolder about basic policies to boost productivity and not be too concerned about which ""club"" they belong to or not. He said: ""Stop thinking that the world owes South Africa something for its past and do things to create a better environment where you can attract a lot more international businesses. ""And most importantly, embrace all your own people in a competitive, open way and find everybody jobs -- unemployment in South Africa is a huge dilemma still."" Nima Elbagir and Teo Kermeliotis contributed to this report.","Economist Jim O'Neill is the creator of the BRIC acronym .

"New York (CNN) -- A federal judge sentenced Ahmed Khalfan Ghailani to life without parole on Tuesday for his role in the 1998 bombings of two U.S. embassies in East Africa, which left 224 people dead and thousands wounded. He is the first Guantanamo detainee tried in U.S. civilian court, having been convicted by a federal jury in November on a single conspiracy charge to destroy buildings and property at U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. ""Finally, 12 1/2 years after those devastating and despicable attacks, Ahmed Ghailani will pay for his crimes,"" U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara told reporters. Ghailani was acquitted of the remaining 284 counts of conspiracy and terrorism-related charges, including conspiring to kill Americans and use weapons of mass destruction. He had faced a minimum of 20 years in prison, but instead received a life sentence. Ghailani, a 36-year-old Tanzanian, never took the stand. ""Today's sentencing of Ahmed Ghailani shows yet again the strength of the American justice system in holding terrorists accountable for their actions,"" U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder said in a written statement. The trial, considered a test for the Obama administration, which had maintained that it could try some terrorism suspects in civilian courts, coincides with both the president's State of the Union address and reports of a possible increase in the use of military commissions. On the eve of the trial, U.S. District Judge Lewis A. Kaplan excluded testimony from a witness that prosecutors said could provide evidence of Ghailani's involvement in the bomb plot, after learning of the witness' coerced interrogation at a CIA-run detention facility abroad. The move raised questions over future convictions in the war against al Qaeda, widening the debate over the use of civilian courts for Guantanamo detainees, including alleged September 11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed. Ghailani was captured in Pakistan in 2004 after training with al-Qaeda leaders in the region, where the government says he became a bodyguard and cook for Osama bin Laden. For two years he was interrogated under the supervision of the Central Intelligence Agency, raising questions of torture that defense attorneys later used as grounds to petition for leniency. Ghailani was then moved to the U.S. naval base in Cuba where he spent the next three years before being transferred into federal custody in New York, according to court documents. Throughout the trial, the defense portrayed Ghailani as a man with local knowledge of Tanzania who was exploited by al Qaeda, arguing that his cumulative detention at secret facilities abroad and at Guantanamo deprived him of a speedy trial. The government rejected the claim that he was duped into participating in planning the attack, pointing to evidence that Ghailani obtained gas tanks in Tanzania and noting his presence in Mombasa, Kenya, with members of the bomb plot. But during court proceedings, jury members showed signs of division. Kaplan rejected a defense plea for a mistrial after a juror claimed to be chastised for disagreeing with fellow jurors, heightening prosecutor fears that Ghailani could elude conviction. The case also came against the background of Ghailani's detention as an ""unlawful enemy combatant,"" a murky classification surrounding the legality of holding terrorism suspects that the Obama administration has tried to distance itself from. But in the weeks after his November conviction, lawmakers passed legislation meant to prevent Pentagon funding from being used to transfer Guantanamo detainees to U.S. soil, stifling an administration pledge to allow more detainees to be tried in civilian courts. CNN's Brian Vitagliano and Adam Reiss contributed to this report .","NEW: Attorney General Eric Holder said the sentencing shows ""strength of the American justice system""

"Naples, Florida (CNN) -- He didn't lose any friends or family on that Tuesday in September of 2001, but Rudi Dekkers achieved infamy that day, watching two of his flight school students commit murder as they steered two hijacked passenger jets into the World Trade Center towers. Today, he celebrates the death of al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden. ""I wish I killed him,"" he told CNN. ""Like a lot of people, I wish I was the one. And bravo to everyone who was behind this. The head of the snake is gone."" Dekkers says he's spent the past 10 years wondering why two terrorists would choose his Venice, Florida, flight school to practice for the day that will go down in U.S. history as one of its greatest tragedies. Now bin Laden may be gone, but the pain is not. ""To realize he's not there anymore takes some time ... it's a deep emotion for me,"" Dekkers said. ""I don't have that closure yet. I feel like it is buried. But it is fine and perfect that he's out of the picture."" Dekkers' life has been turned upside down ever since it became known that Mohamed Atta and Marwan al Shehhi came to his school, Huffman Aviation, to get their multi-engine commercial pilot licenses in the summer of 2000. A year later, Atta piloted American Airlines Flight 11 into the north tower of the World Trade Center and shortly after, al Shehhi steered United Airlines Flight 175 into the south tower. Dekkers wrote a book about it, ""Guilty by Association,"" He says the title pretty much sums up the last 10 years of his life, filled with threats, forced to sell his business. ""Guilty by association is meant as a phrase to mean banks won't borrow you money. I can't get a job because I'm related to 9/11,"" he claimed. And now, with the death of bin Laden, Dekkers is emotionally encouraged, but it's only part of the healing. ""Ten years with this emotion, do you think it's over in one day?"" he asked. ""They want a scapegoat ... when I met people and they found out I was affiliated with this, they turned their back."" Dekkers no longer has a flight school. He was not able to secure financing, he believes, because of his ties to the 9/11 tragedy. He went into the swimming pool business for a while and today he runs a cellular phone business. He says that while the event remains heavy on his mind, he does not feel responsible. ""Is the grocery store responsible for keeping them alive, because they bought groceries there? This is life. We're all caught up in this,"" he said. Dekkers says that both Atta and al Shehhi never displayed any behaviors that would have labeled them as terrorists. At one point, he says, the two men were on the verge of being kicked out of the school because they did not appear to be taking their training seriously and were too busy fooling around and not listening to their instructors. They had to be warned, and went on to become average students, Dekkers said. ""Al Shehhi was a more likable person. He laughed and joked,"" said Dekkers. ""My employees called Atta 'Dead man walking.' He had a white face and no emotions and was a nasty person, very unfriendly,"" Dekkers told CNN. The two future terrorists went on to pass the FAA commercial pilot's test and were granted their licenses. ""I didn't know what they were about to do,"" Dekkers said. ""I don't feel guilty at all. I couldn't do nothing about it. ""I wish I could be a hero. I think about this often. Why me? But that's fate. You can't turn away from fate, I guess.""","Flight school owner says he's suffered for 10 years .

THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED. CARL AZUZ, CNN STUDENT NEWS ANCHOR: We are bringing the world to your classroom. This is CNN Student News! Hello, everyone, and welcome on this Friday, May 6th. My name is Carl Azuz. And as we kick off today's headlines, we're beginning at Ground Zero. First Up: Ground Zero Visit . AZUZ: That's the site of the World Trade Center in New York City, which was targeted in the 9/11 terrorist attacks. And it's where President Obama was yesterday for a ceremony paying tribute to the victims of that violence. The president helped lay a wreath at Ground Zero. Vice President Joe Biden did the same thing at the Pentagon, which was another target of the 9/11 attacks. The president's visit came days after the death of Osama bin Laden, the man behind the attacks. Deborah Feyerick talked with two sisters who were in middle school on September 11th, 2001, and whose father was killed in the attacks. BRIENNE MCNALLY, FATHER KILLED ON 9/11: It's definitely mixed emotions, because you definitely feel relief that somebody that represents injustice and cruelty, that was responsible for the murder of my father, finally, the fact that he's no longer on this earth brings a justice to the situation. But at the same time, it brings up all these emotions from that day when I found out that he died, and just knowing that my dad will never come back. And it's hard to have that hole in your life, and that will never be, I'll never get full closure on that. AZUZ: Samantha Hayes joins us now on the president's visit to Ground Zero. (BEGIN VIDEO) SAMANTHA HAYES, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: President Obama paused Thursday afternoon to honor the victims of September 11th. After the wreath-laying at Ground Zero, the president met privately with the families of 9/11 victims and first responders. It was a moment full of meaning and emotion. SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER, (D) NEW YORK: Most Americans today feel that this is not about any kind of political issue. This is an issue to feel good about America. HAYES: Earlier in the day, the president stopped by the Engine 54 firehouse. This station lost 15 firefighters on September 11th. U.S. PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: This is a symbolic site of the extraordinary sacrifice that was made on that terrible day. CHIEF EDWARD KILDUFF, NY FIRE DEPARTMENT: For him to come here and to see faces of the firefighters who were killed on September 11th to and see the shrine that was erected in their honor really meant something to him. HAYES: The president's visit comes just 24 hours after announcing he would not release the photos of Osama Bin Laden after he was killed. It's a decision that some disagree with, saying the photos offer closure and send a message. BILL BENNETT, CONSERVATIVE TALK SHOW HOST: This is what happens at the end to someone who threatens Americans and who kills Americans. HAYES: As the political discourse continues, so does the progress at Ground Zero. This time lapse by Project Rebirth shows the evolution of the space where the Twin Towers once stood. Another symbol that America is moving forward, but will never forget what happened nearly ten years ago. (END VIDEO) Severe Flooding . AZUZ: Intentionally flooding parts of the U.S. in order to avoid catastrophic floods in other communities. It's not a plan everyone agrees with, but it is a plan that is moving forward. This is what parts of Illinois looked like on Tuesday. River levels have dropped nearly two feet since engineers started their work. But this was the result of that work: plots of farmland in Missouri that are now sitting underwater. The flooding, which has spread into Arkansas, has been caused by massive rain, and meteorologists don't expect that to let up until next month. I.D. Me . BARBARA HALL, CNN STUDENT NEWS: See if you can I.D. Me! I'm a country located in the Western hemisphere. I declared my independence from Spain in 1810. My national Independence Day is September 16th, not May 5th, or Cinco de Mayo. I'm Mexico, and my president is Felipe Calderon. Mexico Mine Blast . AZUZ: An official in President Calderon's administration isn't holding out hope for a group of trapped miners. This started with an explosion on Tuesday morning at a mine in the city of San Juan de Sabinas, Mexico. It's the center of the country's coal mining industry. Rescuers began searching for victims as soon as it was safe for them to go inside the mine's tunnels. As of yesterday, six bodies had been recovered. Mexico's labor secretary said there was ""no hope of life"" for the eight other men trapped in the mine. Unrest in Syria . AZUZ: From Mexico, we're moving to the Middle Eastern nation of Syria. That country's government says military forces are leaving the town of Daraa. Syrian officials say the military finished its mission to ""restore security and calm"" in Daraa. Troops have been fighting with protesters there who've been speaking out against Syria's government. It's been going on for more than a month, and one human rights group says hundreds of people have been killed. Protesters say reports of troops leaving Daraa are not true. Japan Nuclear Crisis . AZUZ: Finally, we go to Japan and to the nuclear power plant that was damaged by that massive earthquake and tsunami back in March. Nearly two months later, engineers continue their work trying to get the Fukushima Daiichi plant's reactors under control. This video shows a robot going into the plant's number one reactor. Yesterday, people went inside for the first time since the quake. They're installing a ventilation system that will hopefully let workers stay inside the reactor longer as they try to shut the thing down. This Day in History . AZUZ: On this day in history, in 1915, George Herman ""Babe"" Ruth hit his first Major League home run. The legendary player hit 713 more of those during his pro career. In 1937, the Hindenburg, a German airship that was the largest dirigible ever built, exploded as it arrived in New Jersey. That killed 36 people. And in 1954, Roger Bannister, a medical student, became the first person to run the mile in under four minutes. He beat it by 6 tenths of a second. Remembering A Combat Veteran . AZUZ: On tomorrow's date in history, back in 1915, a German submarine sank the Lusitania. It was a British passenger ship. And that was a major event during World War I, a conflict that engulfed huge parts of the globe. Yesterday, the last known veteran who fought in that war died. Tamara Akers of Australia's Network Ten has his story. (BEGIN VIDEO) TAMARA AKERS, REPORTER, NETWORK TEN: His navy mates called him ""Chuckles."" Renowned for enjoying a laugh, Claude Choules was in good form right to the end. DAPHNE EDINGER, DAUGHTER: Extremely good spirits. He even sang to us and told some jokes to the kids. AKERS: The world's last World War I combat veteran died in his sleep at a Perth nursing home overnight, age 110. Like many others, he lied about his age and joined the British Navy at 15. CLAUDE CHOULES, LAST WORLD WAR I VETERAN: We all did, all us boys. They didn't have our birth certificates. AKERS: Mr. Choules later transferred to the Australian Navy as a demolition officer. He was integral in diffusing German mines during World War II before retiring in Perth in 1956. Despite all his years of service, Mr. Choules' family said he very rarely spoke about the war. And if he did, it was only ever about the good times. MALCOLM EDINGER, GRANDSON: To him, war was just simply a waste of human resources: life, money and time. He had no time for it. AKERS: Instead, his daughter says he lived for his family, which includes three children and 36 grandchildren, great-grandchildren, and great-great-grandchildren. Mr. Choules also believed they were the secret to a long life. CHOULES: Just marry young and stay young, and have a lovely family. And keep your family around about you, and you're all right then.

"(CNN) -- The United States issued a general travel alert for Americans in Europe on Sunday amid concerns that al Qaeda or related groups plan attacks similar to the 2008 massacre in the Indian city of Mumbai. ""U.S. citizens should take every precaution to be aware of their surroundings and to adopt appropriate safety measures to protect themselves when traveling,"" the notice from the U.S. State Department said. ""We continue to work closely with our European allies on the threat from international terrorism, including al Qaeda."" The advisory is not meant to tell Americans to avoid travel, but to take ""common-sense precautions"" in case of trouble, Undersecretary of State Patrick Kennedy told reporters Sunday. ""If they see unattended packages or hear loud noises or see something beginning to happen that they should quickly move away from them,"" he said. The warning urges them to be cautious in public places like tourist sites and airports or while riding public transportation, and Americans should know how to contact the U.S. Embassy and consider registering their travel plans there, he said. In addition, thousands of U.S. troops based in Germany were placed under a curfew Friday night and were ordered not to wear their uniforms off base, according to an order obtained by CNN. Kennedy said the State Department has issued travel alerts for Europe for ""a variety of reasons"" in the past, including the recent eruption of a volcano in Iceland that snarled air travel across the continent. The State Department said worldwide travel alerts have been issued for U.S. citizens in the past, most recently in early September after the pastor of a small Florida church threatened to burn copies of the Quran, the Islamic holy book. Previous alerts were issued after the 2004 al Qaeda bombings of commuter trains in Spain's capital Madrid and after the 2005 bombings of subway trains and buses in London, England. News emerged last week that Western intelligence officials were looking at information about a possible ""Mumbai-style"" attack in cities across Europe, and a British security source said Saturday that intelligence related to such a plot was being looked at very seriously on both sides of the Atlantic. Mumbai, India's financial hub, was the site of a three-day terror attack in November 2008 that left more than 160 people dead. Ten men launched the carefully planned assault, targeting two major hotels, the historic Victoria Terminus train station and a Jewish cultural center. Kennedy would not comment on specific intelligence sparking the report, but said it followed a ""cumulative"" process. ""We have been monitoring this carefully for at least several weeks,"" he said. Don Hamilton, a former State Department counterterrorism expert told CNN Sunday that the alert is ""about the mildest thing they can say."" ""The State Department is historically extremely cautious about these things,"" he said. It doesn't want to be accused of failing to warn Americans if they have some information about a possible attack beforehand, but Hamilton said the alert is less severe than a more formal travel warning involving concrete threats. A U.S. official said Saturday that the alert was prompted by the volume of intelligence on possible terror threats, rather than any new intelligence. At the White House, spokesman Nicholas Shapiro said President Barack Obama ""has been following the threat information on a daily basis."" ""From the day we became aware of this latest plot, the president made clear we need to do everything possible to disrupt this plot and protect the American people,"" Shapiro said. Sunday's alert ""is responsive to the president's direction that we spare no effort,"" he said. A senior administration official who spoke on condition of anonymity said Obama met with members of his national security team Friday night and Saturday morning and received another briefing Sunday morning. The official said European allies are ""all in sync"" with the United States, ""both in terms of our assessment of the threat as well as our shared conviction that governments have an obligation to keep their citizens informed of terrorist threats."" Several European governments said Sunday that they are not raising their already-high alert levels as a result of the latest reports. The French Ministry of Foreign Affairs said Sunday that the U.S. advisory was ""in line with the general recommendations that we have addressed to the French population."" ""The indications provided by the U.S. authorities, in particular regarding terrorist threat in Europe are, of course analyzed, cross-referenced and where appropriate included in our national assessment of the threat, which still relies on a series of elements,"" the ministry said. ""The terrorist threat remains high in France, the alert level remains unchanged at level red."" Britain's Foreign and Commonwealth Office changed its travel advisory for British citizens in France and Germany from a ""substantial"" threat of terrorism to a ""high"" threat, but the FCO said it does not comment on intelligence matters and thus can't specify whether the change is related to the U.S. travel alert. Germany's interior ministry said in a statement that the warning for Americans comes in light of recent threats and that Berlin was informed by the U.S. of the decision to issue the alert. Germany will analyze and evaluate the intelligence data coming in but will not be changing its current threat level at this time, according to the statement. Also, a spokeswoman for Spain's Interior Ministry told CNN that the country will remain at Level 2 alert, which indicates a ""high, probable risk"" of a terror attack. Spain has remained at this stage since January of this year. CNN's Ed Henry, Elise Labott, Bharati Naik and Al Goodman contributed to this report.","State Department urges ""common-sense precautions"" for travelers .

"Manama, Bahrain (CNN) -- At least two people were killed early Thursday morning when Bahraini police swarmed into the capital, Manama, to roust protesters from the Pearl Roundabout, emergency hospital services said. Witnesses said police came in with dozens of vehicles, surrounded the roundabout and began firing ""pellet bullets,"" rubber bullets and tear gas at demonstrators. The area had become a magnet for pro-democracy activists, angered by the killing of two demonstrators by security forces earlier this week. For two days, protesters were largely left alone by authorities. But around 3:30 a.m. Thursday (7:30 p.m. Wednesday ET), police changed tactics. Hundreds of white-helmeted police swarmed the roundabout. There are reports that at least 100 people have been injured. Most of the casualties have being sent to Salamaniya hospital, according to an operator at Manama's other main hospital, Bahrain International. CNN's Nic Robertson was there at the hospital. He reported that a large group of ""very angry"" people had gathered, along with distraught family members looking for loved ones. Robertson said demonstrators he'd spoken to were outraged by the way they'd been treated by security forces. Inside the hospital's emergency treatment room, the scene was one of ""complete, uncontrolled chaos,"" according to Robertson. He described injured people struggling to survive and medical personnel working frantically to save them. He saw serious head traumas, bloody wounds in the head and chest, and people hooked up to breathing apparatuses. Robertson told CNN that all the indications pointed to a very bloody confrontation on the part of police. During the crackdown in Pearl Roundabout, an ABC reporter was attacked while he was on the phone, describing the scene for the network. In the midst of his report, Miguel Marquez could suddenly be heard shouting on the audiotape, ""Journalist! Journalist! No! No!"" Heavy thuds and the sounds of police yelling could also be heard. After several minutes, Marquez insisted repeatedly ""I'm going! I'm going!"" and called out for co-workers. Finally, he returned to the audio line and told what had just happened. His voice broke as he said, ""These people are not screwing around."" One of the protesters, who asked that he be identified only as ""Hussein,"" said the police came in with no warning. ""We were sleeping,"" he said. ""There were guys, kids, schoolchildren, women, and suddenly they just attacked us with tear gas, stun bombs."" Hussein said many people were wounded in the attack, and he helped take people to hospitals. Police were outside the hospitals as well, he said. ""No one was doing anything,"" he said. ""Kids were sleeping. Women were sleeping. They just attacked us suddenly."" Ebrahim Sharif, secretary-general of the opposition National Democratic Action Society, said he saw ambulances taking people to hospitals but that police were blocking people from going in that direction. ""The whole area here has been surrounded,"" he told CNN by telephone. ""There are probably 500 to 1,000 policemen."" Dozens of large police vehicles lined a highway overlooking the roundabout and helicopters buzzed the area. Police were also taking up positions to create a perimeter as much as a mile around the roundabout, preventing people from returning. An hour after police moved in, the square, where thousands of people had been, was largely empty except for police. It was not immediately clear where the protesters had gone, but police activity indicated they were still involved in moving the demonstrators further from the roundabout. On Wednesday, Bahrain's Interior Ministry had said those involved in two deaths during previous protests had been placed in custody. ""We express our regret over those who died or were injured in the latest incidents and extend our sincere condolences to their families and to the people of Bahrain,"" according to a statement on the ministry's website. Earlier Wednesday, thousands of people gathered for a peaceful funeral procession for a Bahraini man killed when clashes erupted during another protester's funeral procession, the president of a human rights group said. Demonstrators picked up the body of Fadhel Matrook, 31, from a morgue Wednesday and marched to a cemetery with no police presence on the streets, said Nabeel Rajab, president of the Bahrain Center for Human Rights. Rajab, who marched in the funeral procession, said at the time that protests in Bahrain were ""peaceful"" since ""there is not interference from the police."" Human rights groups say Matrook was shot by security forces using pellet guns during the Tuesday procession for Ali Abdulhadi Mushaima, who was killed Monday. Rajab said Mushaima was protesting for human rights near Manama. King Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa had vowed Tuesday that his government would investigate the killings of the two protesters by security forces. ""We will ask the legislative authority to look at this phenomena and to suggest the necessary legislation which will solve this in a way that will benefit the homeland and its citizens,"" he said. The Interior Ministry said in its statement that ""... our constitution and laws guarantee the freedom of expression through peaceful means"" and that ""citizens can ask for rights and reforms through available legitimate channels."" Bahrain is among the latest Arab states to face a surge of dissent following the revolts that toppled longtime autocrats in Tunisia and Egypt. By Wednesday morning, thousands of activists were camping out at the foot of the Pearl Roundabout, a Bahraini landmark. At the time, police were nowhere in sight as about 3,000 people laid out blankets and pitched tents. ""It's a very relaxed atmosphere,"" Mansoor Al-Jamri, editor of the newspaper Al Wasat, had told CNN. ""You'd assume it was a picnic area if you didn't know it was the aftermath of people who died."" Activists have decried the use of pellet guns at short range by Bahrain's security forces. Amnesty International called the deaths ""tragic"" and ""a very worrying development."" In a recent report, the group said Bahraini authorities detained 23 opposition political activists in August and September, and held them without contact for two weeks, ""during which some allege they were tortured."" Bahrain's Interior Ministry said on its website that an investigation has been ordered to find out the reason behind the incident. The kingdom's main opposition party, al Wifaq, has suspended its participation in parliament because of the security forces' action. Bahrain is an American ally and houses the headquarters of the U.S. Navy's Fifth Fleet. In Washington, the State Department said Tuesday it was ""very concerned"" by the violence and said it welcomed the promise of an investigation. Bahrain is ruled by a Sunni Muslim royal family, but two-thirds of the population are Shiites. In recent years, younger Shiites have staged violent protests to complain about discrimination, unemployment and corruption, and many Shiites say the country's constitution has done little to improve their condition. The protest movement in Bahrain has been organized using social media websites such as Facebook and Twitter, in the same manner as the protests in Tunisia and Egypt.

"(CNN) -- Opponents and supporters of Venezuela's government staged rival demonstrations Sunday in the streets of the capital to mark the anniversary of a popular revolt that overthrew a dictatorship in the South American country in 1958. In Caracas, supporters of Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez gathered around the presidential palace to listen to him speak on what is known there as ""National Democracy Day."" ""Every day, there will be more democracy in Venezuela -- this democracy that gives more power to the people,"" Chavez said, as reported by the state-run AVN news agency. ""Democracy is as necessary to socialism as oxygen is to living things."" The president's supporters cheered and waved flags and banners. Critics of Chavez's government met in the eastern part of the capital, the state-run VTV network reported. Many waved white banners. One protester carried a poster that read: ""Enough of the lies."" Marches were also planned in various cities around the world to declare that ""the current Venezuelan regime is a dictatorship both legally and politically,"" according to organizer Un Mundo Sin Mordaza. Opponents of Chavez have sharply criticized last month's decision by Venezuela's lame-duck National Assembly granting him the power to pass laws by decree for 18 months. Critics say the president sought the power in order to push his agenda through the legislative body after elections in September weakened the ruling party's hold on power. But Chavez has said he was seeking the powers in order to be able to respond to flooding that left thousands of people homeless. January 23 marks the anniversary of the overthrow of former Venezuelan dictator Gen. Marcos Perez Jimenez.","NEW: President Chavez addresses his supporters outside the presidential palace .

"(CNN) -- Four white doves were released Wednesday after funeral services for an Indiana woman and her three children, dead in what police describe as a murder-suicide. Investigators believe Amanda Bennett, 30, shot her three children -- 14-year-old Jasmine Abbott, 9-year-old Katelynn Bennett and 4-year-old Ryan Bennett --  in their Austin, Indiana, home, set a small fire in the house and then turned the gun on herself. Services were held at First Christian Church in nearby Scottsburg, Charlotte Bennett, the grandmother of two of the children, told CNN. ""There were thousands of people there,"" she said. The caskets were taken out to the parking lot after the funeral. The song ""Come to Jesus"" was performed and the doves were released, she said. ""It was an awesome [moment]."" Police conducting a welfare check on the family last Friday found the bodies. The family's dog was also shot, but it survived and was being treated at a veterinary clinic, Indiana State Police said. The children were out of school on Friday because of a recent snowstorm, Indiana State Police spokesman Sgt. Jerry Goodin told CNN Wednesday. Investigators believe the children were asleep when they were shot, he said. Friends told reporters Amanda and John Bennett, father of the two younger children, had marital problems. A divorce petition filed two weeks before the deaths, obtained by CNN affiliate WAVE, said the two had been separated since October. Amanda Bennett, in the petition, had asked for temporary custody of the children. Court filings show the couple had also declared bankruptcy in 2009, WAVE said. The couple were supposed to be at divorce hearing this Friday, Charlotte Bennett said. Her son, John, was seeking joint custody of the children, she said. The grandmother said Amanda lived with her a couple of years before dating John. ""She was an awesome mother,"" Charlotte Bennett said. Charlotte Bennett said she spoke with Amanda several hours before the bodies were found. ""She seemed to be fine."" Jasmine was a typical teen girl who linked to primp and Katelynn was smart and loved everything, Charlotte Bennett said. ""Ryan was all boy."" The two younger children were buried with their mother while Jasmine will be buried in another town where her father lives, Charlotte Bennett said. Jasmine was ""like a daughter"" to John Bennett, Charlotte said. Thousands of people turned out Tuesday during a six-hour visitation for the four, according to CNN affiliate WRTV. ""I came out here to ... show my support for John and his family and to give them my prayers,"" Rhonda Jones told WAVE, referring to the father of the two youngest children. ""They had their whole lives in front of them,"" William Bellamy, who attended the visitation, told CNN affiliate WHAS of the children. ""Their mom took the best part of their years, really ... because they could have turned out to be anything."" In a statement, family spokesman Roger Gay told WAVE, ""We want to thank family, friends and the community for support and prayers through this tragedy. John is in shock and will be for a long time."" Charlotte Bennett echoed that sentiment, saying of her son, ""He's kind of in shock. He lost his whole world."" Goodin told CNN that authorities examined online content as part of their investigation, including a posting purportedly from Amanda Bennett that blamed her husband. ""You got what you wanted,"" the posting said, according to CNN affiliate WDRB. ""No wife and no kids."" However, the motive is unclear, and probably will remain that way, Goodin said. ""The only person that knows the motive is Amanda,"" he said. Austin is about 35 miles north of Louisville, Kentucky. A neighbor of the Bennetts told CNN Wednesday that Amanda was considerate of her and friendly. ""I don't see how she could have done it,"" said Ruby C. Gay. ""It really upset me terrible. She was always good to the children."" ""They were wonderful children and well-behaved,"" according to Gay, who said she used to give treats to the children.

"Washington (CNN) -- Within hours of President Barack Obama's announcement that Osama bin Laden had been killed, politics entered the fray. A small but vocal group of Republicans including former Bush administration officials began claiming that information obtained from waterboarding and other now-prohibited enhanced interrogation techniques led to the successful assault on bin Laden's compound in Pakistan. Debate rages about role of torture . Interviews and commentaries by conservatives, including former Vice President Dick Cheney repeated the contention, citing media reports rather than direct information. A closer look shows no obvious evidence of a direct connection, at least to waterboarding, the simulated drowning technique considered to be torture under international law. While administration officials, former interrogators and others concede that thousands of pieces of information collected over the past nine years eventually brought U.S. Navy SEALs to bin Laden, no one has cited specific information that came from the harsh interrogations labeled torture. That doesn't stop defenders of enhanced interrogations from trying. Republican Rep. Peter King, the chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, said that waterboarding alleged 9/11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed caused him to eventually provide information on the al Qaeda courier killed with bin Laden in the raid. Was bin Laden's killing legal? Mohammed was captured in 2003, and another high-value suspect, Abu Faraj al Libi, was captured in 2005. ""I think it's fair to say that it's a long way to getting bin Laden, but the first step along that road began with the intense interrogation"" of Mohammed and al Libi, King said. However, as CNN Senior Political Analyst Gloria Borger reported Wednesday, Central Intelligence Agency operatives already knew the courier's nickname when they interrogated Mohammed and al Libi. According to Borger's report, the detainee who initially provided the courier's nickname may have been subjected to harsh interrogation, but not waterboarding. Later, Mohammed lied to his interrogators about the courier, who was described as his protege, and intelligence personnel concluded that the courier was important because Mohammed was trying to cover for him, a senior U.S. official said. U.S. intelligence eventually uncovered the courier's identity four years ago ""from a different part of the world,"" the senior U.S. official said. Trail to bin Laden started with courier . King argued that Mohammed only talked after being waterboarded, and even though he lied about the courier, the fact he talked at all showed the value of waterboarding. To Deputy National Security Adviser Denis McDonough, no such connection exists. ""This whole idea about somehow whether EITs (enhanced interrogation techniques) played into that, I think, is just not consistent with the facts, and, also, a little bit of a sideshow, as far as I'm concerned,"" McDonough said. White House Press Secretary Jay Carney told reporters Wednesday that locating bin Laden required years of painstaking work that eventually led to discovery of the address of the Pakistan compound last August. ""I can say with certainty that no single piece of information, with the exception of the address of the compound, was ... singularly vital to this, because we're talking about tiny bits of information that were compiled by unbelievably competent professionals over nine and a half years,"" Carney said. ""And it's impossible to know if one piece of information came from one source and was corroborated in another way; if, you know which thread held the cloth together, with the exception of the location of the compound."" Carney acknowledged that some information came from terrorism detainees, which he called one of many ways that information was gathered. ""Now, I can't categorically rule out that one piece of information"" played a key role, ""because we don't know,"" Carney said. Mark Fallon, a former interrogator at the Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, terrorist detention facility, rejected claims that enhanced interrogation techniques led to bin Laden's capture. ""I think some people are trying to rewrite history here,"" Fallon told MSNBC, adding that he was privy to information from Mohammed and wasn't aware ""of any substantive information or intelligence that was a derivative product of waterboarding."" One of Obama's first acts as president was to halt waterboarding and other enhanced interrogation techniques of the Bush administration. The issue was one of the most contentious of the Bush presidency, with critics accusing the administration of legalizing torture while supporters called the enhanced interrogations necessary for combating terrorism. Now, those who were under fire for the interrogation policies are claiming vindication and calling for their return. John Yoo, a Bush administration lawyer who wrote the memo justifying the enhanced techniques, said in a posting Monday on the National Review website that the policy had worked. However, his posting only cited media reports based on anonymous sources, rather than any specific information gleaned from interrogated detainees. Marc Thiessen, a visiting fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, made similar assertions on the group's website, but began his commentary by attributing his information to news reports. Cheney, interviewed on ABC and Fox, said he assumed enhanced interrogation techniques played a role in bin Laden's demise, but added he had no proof. Former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said that information was key to the fight against terrorism. ""Now let's remember that in the early days, we knew very little about how al Qaeda operated and the roundup of their field generals like Khalid Sheikh Mohammed led us not just to learn that there was a courier -- I remember when they learned there was a courier who might be a link to Osama bin Laden -- but we also learned from those people about the structure of al Qaeda,"" Rice said. However, Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein, who chairs the Senate Intelligence Committee, said she was unaware of any information eventually leading to bin Laden's location that ""came as a result of harsh interrogation practices."" Two conservative senators -- Republicans John McCain of Arizona and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina -- also rejected the claim that waterboarding and other enhanced interrogation played a role in finding bin Laden. ""This idea -- we caught Bin Laden because of waterboarding -- I think is a misstatement,"" Graham said, citing instead the years of difficult intelligence work. ""I do not believe this is a time to celebrate waterboarding. I believe this is a time to celebrate hard work."" CNN's Gloria Borger contributed to this story.","Conservatives say Bush-era policies are vindicated .

"(CNN) -- Bangladesh's Supreme Court has rejected an appeal by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus to keep his position as managing director of the bank he founded. Yunus founded the Grameen Bank three decades ago in what he said was an effort to alleviate poverty. Grameen's work cast a global spotlight on microcredit, a then-novel idea of making small loans to poor people who would not qualify for standard bank loans. For their efforts, Yunus and Grameen Bank won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2006. He also was awarded the American Presidential Medal of Freedom and a Congressional Gold Medal. Last month, the central bank of Bangladesh -- the regulatory authority in the South Asian nation -- cited the 70-year-old's age in explaining his removal as managing director. The government, which has a 25% stake in Grameen, said that the bank's rules required Yunus to end his service when he turned 60. The case wound its way to the Supreme Court, which issued its ruling Tuesday. Lawmakers in the United States, and in other countries, have asked the Bangladeshi government to find a compromise to bring an end to the Grameen Bank crisis. ""The international community will watch this situation closely, and I hope that both sides can reach a compromise that maintains Grameen Bank's autonomy and effectiveness,"" said Sen. John Kerry, the chairman of the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee, last month. ""Institutions like the Grameen Bank make a significant contribution to Bangladesh's development and democracy, and Professor Yunus' life-long work to reduce poverty and empower women through microloans has deservedly received world-wide attention and respect."" Yunus' supporters have said the government's effort to remove him has little to do with age and much to do with opposition to microcredit and Grameen's execution of it. Critics of microcredit have charged that lenders were making big money off of small loans. Others have suggested that the actions against Yunus are politically motivated, a claim denied by the government. Yunus' supporters say he has been under fire for criticizing politicians and trying to form his own political party four years ago during an interim, unelected, military-backed government. That party was later abandoned. Ashraful Islam, general secretary of the ruling Awami League party, told reporters last month that the government wanted to resolve the issue ""sympathetically,"" but Yunus had obstructed the process by going to the court. Khaleda Zia, a former prime minister and now opposition leader in parliament, lashed out at the government for going after the nation's only Nobel laureate. ""The move was designed to belittle Yunus, who had earned prestige for the country,"" she said. In a statement issued last month, Yunus said he strongly believes Grameen will continue to work to empower the poor, especially women in rural areas. ""Opportunity has to be created to hand over the charge of Grameen Bank in a happy environment so that it could achieve its objectives,"" Yunus said. ""I am continuing the effort and it will go on until getting friendly cooperation from all.""

"(CNN) -- Despite the ribbing he took from President Barack Obama and comedian Seth Meyers, media mogul Donald Trump proclaimed Saturday night's White House Correspondents Dinner ""an entertaining evening.""

In Washington, Trump still talk of town . ""They were pretty personal, but I expected that I was going to be zinged,"" Trump told CNN's Don Lemon on Sunday night. At one point in the presentation, Obama singled out an unsmiling Trump and credited him with making hard decisions -- such as firing Gary Busey over Meat Loaf on an episode of ""The Celebrity Apprentice"" -- and succeeding in his push for the president to release his long-form birth certificate. ""Now, he can focus on more important matters like, did we fake the moon landing? What really happened in Roswell? And where are Biggie and Tupac?"" Obama said, referring to Neil Armstrong's 1969 walk on the moon, the alleged UFO crash in New Mexico and the deaths of rappers Biggie Smalls and Tupac Shakur. But appearances aside, Trump had nothing but good things to say about Obama's comedic timing, telling CNN that ""some of what the president did was pretty good."" ""It's my honor,"" he added, referring to the amount of jokes directed at him. ""It was a lion's pit, I was walking into it, I've been there before, and you know, I thought it was an entertaining evening.""

"Atlanta (CNN) -- One of the world's largest concrete pumps is being readied to get on a massive cargo plane and head to Japan, all part of the effort to address the crisis at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. The 190,000-pound truck pump was moved off a job on the Savannah River on Wednesday and, two days later, was in Hanahan, South Carolina. Once preparations are complete, it will head about 7,000 miles toward Asia aboard a Russian Antonov 225 cargo plane, which is considered among the world's biggest aircraft. The U.S. Department of Energy had been using the big pumper at a mixed oxide fuel plant construction site in southeastern Georgia. Eventually, nuclear waste is to be disposed of here. But the decision was made to transfer it to Japan -- along with several other such large pumps, from around the world -- in order to deal with a disaster that has been brewing since a March 11 earthquake and tsunami wreaked havoc at the plant and stoked fears about massive releases of radiation. ""I use the pump every day at the river site, but they're trying to avert a situation that worsens each day,"" said Jerry Ashmore, the owner of Ashmore Concrete Contractors that supplies concrete for the Savannah River facility. ""They need all this equipment. They need help."" Company officials say the prep work should be done by this weekend. Then, Georgia's transportation department must sign off on necessary highway and bridge permits, which are required due to the pumper truck's immense size. Eventually, it will be driven west to Atlanta, to be ideally flown out of the country by next Friday. Ashmore didn't have all the details about how the concrete pump will be used once it gets to Japan, though he understood its first mission will be to pump water to prevent overheating and the further emission of radioactive material. ""I understand it will be used to pump water into the reactor and later they can use it for concrete operations that need to be done,"" said Ashmore. The big pump, one of a handful of such trucks built by the German company Putzmeister, appears to be tailor-made for this type of project -- especially in a radioactive environment. And this is not the first-time the company's large concrete pumps have been utilized to help address a nuclear crisis. In 1986, 11 Putzmeister concrete pumps were used after the Chernobyl accident in Ukraine, then a part of the Soviet Union. The reactors' core were encased in massive amounts of concrete, to prevent the further release of any more radiation. For weeks, similar concrete pump engines have been used at the embattled power plant, as a conduit for water going into reactors and spent nuclear fuel pools. But the new pumps, like the one from the Savannah River site, have the advantage of being appreciably larger, making them potentially more useful for spraying water or a possible end-game scenario involving encasing nuclear reactor cores in concrete. Its 70-meter boom can be controlled remotely, which should allow it to disperse cooling water in pinpointed locations over a large distance, say experts. Typically trucks this massive are used in large projects using concrete, such as the construction of bridges or high-rise buildings. According to Putzmeister's website, the company has already re-directed a truck-mounted concrete pump from an unknown location in Southeast Asia to head to the Fukushima Daiichi site, which is 240 kilometers (150 miles) north of Tokyo. Another smaller Putzmeister pumper, currently in Los Angeles, is also being readied to fly to Japan.","A 190,000-pound truck pump is now in South Carolina, being prepped to fly out of Atlanta .

"(CNN) -- Not divulging why she left, a Georgia sheriff said Thursday that a mother of five who disappeared last week is safe, healthy and not about to face criminal charges. ""The case of Wazineh Suleiman is closed,"" Bartow County Sheriff Clark Millsap told reporters in Cartersville. ""She is in a safe location, she is alive, she is well."" Suleiman hadn't been heard from since last Friday night, when her husband arrived home to find the couple's children, ages 6 through 12 alone, and no sign of his wife since she'd left him uncharacteristically profane text messages. Millsap on Thursday refused to explain why Suleiman may have gone missing, saying only that ""why she left is her business, and not ours."" ""Our main concern was to make sure that she was safe and we have discovered that,"" the sheriff said. ""Anything that is going on at her residence is her business and her husband's business."" Since being found, the woman told authorities that she does not want ""to let anyone know where she is"" -- a request Millsap said law enforcement officers will respect. Police also have not offered details about how or where she was found. The sheriff said that no criminal charges will be filed against anyone in the case. Earlier Thursday, her father, Basem Jaber, said only that Suleiman was ""safe"" and with members of the sheriff's department. He said he did not know why his daughter went missing, saying only he was very happy she'd been found and he expected to see her for the first time later Thursday afternoon. ""She's good, she's in good condition,"" he told reporters Thursday outside the Bartow County sheriff's office. Suleiman's husband, Abed Suleiman, has said that, after attending Friday prayers, he brought home four pizzas at his wife's request and the family ate dinner together. He then set out for Kentucky on a turkey hunting trip with a male friend. When Abed Suleiman and his friend were about an hour from home they were informed that turkey hunting season was to begin the following weekend. They immediately turned around, the husband said. The friend corroborated the story and receipts back it up, Millsap has said. Wazineh Suleiman was last heard from that night, according to her husband of 14 years, in the form of profanity-laced text messages that she sent him. ""It's over and I'm throwing the phone out the window,'' read one of the messages. Others contained curses, including the f-word, he said, . ""She would never, ever send me a text message or use that word in front of me or to me at all,"" Abed Suleiman said Wednesday on HLN's ""Nancy Grace."" ""That's the way she is,'' he said. His 30-year-old wife is a kindergarten teacher's assistant. When he arrived home last Friday around 9 p.m., Abed Suleiman found his five children home alone, something he said had never happened before at night. His oldest child told him their mother had been gone 10 minutes. The husband said he thought Wazineh Suleiman had gone to a Walmart to rent a video. But police say there is no evidence she ever made it to Walmart. Later that evening, Abed Suleiman called police to report her missing. Until Thursday, the biggest development in the case came Tuesday, when the family's 2004 Nissan Armada was found in an empty parking lot near Interstate 75. Abed Suleiman, a pharmacist, said Wednesday that his wife's credit cards hadn't been used since she went missing. The couple filed for bankruptcy in August. Abed Suleiman said, ""I have a good income and I bought two very expensive properties in south Florida"" that they ended up being unable to afford. HLN's Philip Rosenbaum contributed to this report.

"(CNN) -- In light of reports that linked the name ""Geronimo"" with the operation that took down Osama bin Laden, Native Americans expressed disappointment Thursday and pointed to the sacrifices they have made in the service. ""To associate a Native warrior with bin Laden is not an accurate reflection of history and it undermines the military service of Native people,"" said Jefferson Keel, president of the National Congress of American Indians. ""It's critical that military leaders and operational standards honor the service of those who protect our freedom."" Initial press reports said that ""Geronimo"" was used in the raid to refer to bin Laden, but a senior administration official later told CNN that it was code for the act of capturing or killing bin Laden, not for the man himself. Keel said that according to his understanding, the most-wanted terrorist's code name was ""Jackpot,"" and the name of the operation was ""Geronimo."" Geronimo was an Apache leader in the late 1800s who is revered by many in the Southwest as a hero, the NCAI said. Harlyn Geronimo, a descendant of the warrior, was sharply critical of the use of his great-grandfather's name. ""Whether it was intended only to name the military operation to kill or capture Osama bin Laden or to give Osama bin Laden himself the code name Geronimo, either was an outrageous insult and mistake,"" he said. To use the name is ""such a subversion of history that it also defames a great human spirit and Native American leader,"" he said. Thom Wallace, communications director of NCAI, said that whatever the reason behind the use of the name ""Geronimo"" and the debate over it, the real conversation was being lost. That conversation, he said, is about the 24,000 American Indian active members of the military. A disproportionately high number of Native Americans serve in the U.S. military, he said. The group pointed out that 61 American Indians and Alaskan Natives have been killed serving in the armed forces in Afghanistan and Iraq, and 445 have been injured. ""Let's be very clear about what is important here: The successful removal of Osama bin Laden as a threat to the United States honors the sacrifice these Native warriors made for the United States and their people,"" said Keel, himself a veteran.","Tying Geronimo to bin Laden ""undermines the military service of Native people,"" official says .

"(CNN) -- Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, made its own history Tuesday as its homicide rate reached 3,000 deaths for the year -- 10 times the number of killings annually that the border city counted just a few years ago. With two weeks left in the year, 2010 is now the deadliest year Juarez has ever seen, a spokesman for the Chihuahua state attorney general's office told CNN. ""At 12:15 p.m. we hit 3,000 murders for the year. The state attorney general's office had the number at 2,998 as of Monday and with the two murders today that brings us to 3,000,"" spokesman Arturo Sandoval said in a phone interview with CNN late Tuesday. The killings happened in two separate incidents, according to Sandoval. One of the victims was found shot dead in a car and the other was shot and killed in front of relatives. The victims, 35 and 46 respectively, were both males, Sandoval said. Before a spasm of drug-related violence hit the city in 2008, the bloodiest year in Juarez was around 300, according to Sandoval.

"Washington (CNN) -- The NATO request for the United States to continue flying its planes capable of striking at Libyan troops on the ground has raised concern that coalition forces do not have the military equipment needed for the type of strikes necessary to continue degrading Libya's military. The United States was expected to stop flying its A-10s and AC-130s this weekend as NATO took over leadership of the entire mission. The planes are equipped to fly lower and slower than fighter jets, which improves accuracy in targeting of troops and tanks that are in and around cities. Days of bad weather in Libya hampered visibility and the ability of coalition planes to strike at advancing Libyan troops with as little risk to civilians as possible, and NATO asked the United States extend flying the specialized planes through Monday, according to Oana Lungescu, a NATO spokeswoman. Learn more about the 'unique resources' provided by the United States . But a NATO official said that, weather aside, only the United States has the ability from the air to strike at mobile troops and equipment. NATO needed that from the United States, the NATO official said. ""Specifically the A10s and the AC-130s nobody else but the U.S. has,"" the official noted. The transition from U.S. command to NATO command, and the subsequent halt to flights of U.S. fighter jets over Libya, was not supposed to lessen the coalition capabilities, U.S. officials had said. When NATO first announced the agreement to take over the mission, a senior administration official briefing reporters at the State Department insisted that the transition would not hamper the operation. ""It means, in practice, that NATO will conduct the military operation in a way that is very similar to the way the coalition has conducted it up to this point, and no more but also no less,"" the senior administration official said. Congress, most notably Republican senators John McCain of Arizona and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, warned last week that the U.S. decision to stop flying planes like the A10 and AC130 while the Libyan military is still fighting hard was a big mistake. ""The fact is that your timing is exquisite,"" McCain said at a hearing last week where the secretary of defense and chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff were testifying about Libya. ""At a time when the Gadhafi forces have literally tragically routed the anti-Gadhafi forces, that's when we announced that the United States is abdicating its leadership role and removing some of the most valuable assets that could be used to great effect against those rebels. "" The Joint Chiefs chairman, Adm. Michael Mullen, insisted that taking the planes out would not lessen the coalition capabilities. The coalition efforts ""could be sustained at the necessary levels to support the opposition,"" he said. Defense Secretary Robert Gates and Mullen said while the United States was pulling the planes from daily use, they would be on standby in case NATO needed them. The NATO official said it is ""possible"" they could keep returning to the battlefield when there is bad weather and NATO calls for them, if Gates approves the use. The United States is also supplying what officials refer to as ""unique capabilities,"" like surveillance drones, electronic jamming equipment and refueling planes.","NATO has asked the United States to continue airstrikes through Monday .

"Havana, Cuba (CNN) -- Former Cuban President Fidel Castro slammed the method used to kill Osama bin Laden on Thursday, saying there is no excuse for ""assassinating"" an unarmed man in front of his family. ""Whatever the actions attributed to bin Laden, the assassination of an unarmed human being surrounded by his family constitutes an abhorrent act,"" Castro wrote in an essay published in state media. Castro criticized bin Laden for ""international terrorism"" and said Cuba showed solidarity with the United States after the ""brutal"" September 11 attacks. However, in the article Castro calls the killing of bin Laden an ""execution"" by U.S. Navy SEALs and says the attack and the subsequent burial at sea ""show fear and insecurity, and turn him into a much more dangerous person."" White House Press Secretary Jay Carney has told reporters bin Laden and his family lived on the second and third floors of his compound, and they were cleared last, with bin Laden killed toward the end of the siege. Bin Laden was not armed but did put up resistance when U.S. forces entered the compound, he said. One of bin Laden's daughters has told Pakistani interrogators that she saw her father shot, a senior Pakistani intelligence source said Wednesday. The daughter, believed to be 12 or 13 years old, was among those left behind at the compound after Monday's U.S. raid, the source said. In the article, Castro also said Pakistan's laws had been violated and its ""national dignity offended."" U.S. President Barack Obama has said the United States will not release the photos of bin Laden's corpse. While some U.S. politicians have said the photos should be released, others have said the photos would only serve to inflamme feelings among bin Laden supporters. Castro concludes in his essay that American public opinion will turn in time. ""After the initial euphoria, public opinion in the United States will end up criticizing the methods, which,"" he wrote, ""far from protecting its citizens, will end up multiplying the feelings of hate and venegence toward them."" -- From CNN's Shasta Darlington .","Castro says ""assassination"" is an ""abhorrent act""

"Tunis, Tunisia (CNN) -- Tunisia on Sunday ended a three-day mourning period for dozens of people killed in protests that ousted the country's long-term president. As the mourning period came to a close, small protests broke out in the capital, Tunis. Protesters have decried a new government formed in the wake of President Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali's ouster. They have called it a sham, and demanded that officials with connections to the old guard be fired. The nation's interim prime minister said that his country would hold its first free democratic elections since gaining independence and vowed to leave politics after the ballot. ""We want to make the next elections the first transparent and legitimate elections since independence,"" Tunisian Interim Prime Minister Mohammed Ghannouchi said Friday. Ghannouchi said he will retire from politics after the elections are held. Tunisia gained independence from France in 1956. Ghannouchi said upcoming political reforms would ""scrap all undemocratic laws including laws involving political parties, the elections and the anti-terrorism law that was abused by the former regime."" ""I lived like all Tunisians, in pain and fear"" under the former president, Ghannouchi said. Ben Ali was ousted in a rebellion a week ago after ruling the north African nation for 23 years. Ghannouchi resigned from his ruling party this week and was appointed interim Prime Minister by the interim President Fouad Mebazaa. Ben Ali's Constitutional Democratic Rally's central committee was dissolved last week. All Cabinet members who belonged to the party have quit it. The party, known as the RCD, suffered a major blow earlier this week when Ghannouchi and Mebazaa submitted their resignations from the party, though they remained in the government, Tunis TV reported. His ouster followed weeks of protests over what discontented Tunisians said were poor living conditions, high unemployment, government corruption and repression. More than 100 people were killed in protests that followed over the past five weeks, the United Nations said.","A three-day mourning period ends Sunday .

"(CNN) -- Hurricane season will soon be upon the Caribbean -- a time of year when storms and strong winds lash many of the islands so popular as vacation destinations for travelers across the world. Currently, however, a different tempest is raging between two neighboring countries over something far more trivial, but no less volatile -- soccer. Haiti and Jamaica are the latest nations to become embroiled in an unseemly spat that was born on the football field but quickly escalated to dominate and strain diplomatic channels. Not in doubt is the fact that Haiti's under-17 team had their dream of reaching the soccer World Cup crushed after being forced to withdraw from a qualifying tournament hosted by Jamaica. Pretty much everything else is up for debate. Jamaica claims that two Haiti players, and their coach, tested positive for malaria and the rest of the team were quarantined to safeguard the public from the disease. Haiti says the three individuals in question were not properly cared for and that the rest of the delegation were detained, forced to take anti-malarial drugs and treated like ""criminals"" up until their departure. Upon returning home Haiti officials promptly recalled their charge d'affaires to Jamaica, while a protest saw thousands march through the capital Port-au-Prince to protest against the treatment meted out to the youth team. Jamaica insists the matter is now closed after an assurance from Haitian President René Préval, but those closely involved in the saga are in no mood to forgive or forget. It is not the first time the beautiful game has been the catalyst for a diplomatic flashpoint. The most notorious row ended in a four-day war between El Salvador and Honduras. The bordering nations had been at odds over issues of migration and land reform in 1969 when they were drawn to play each other in qualifying for the 1970 World Cup. The two legs prompted violent clashes between fans, the cutting of diplomatic ties and skirmishes on the border before Salvador launched bombing raids shortly after. Four days later a cease-fire deal was clinched. And more recently, World Cup qualifying also sparked conflict between African neighbors Egypt and Algeria in 2009 as the Algerian team bus was stoned in Cairo. Algeria then refused to allow an Egyptian plane to land, prompting a recall of ambassadors. Scuffles dominated the matches between the pair as Algeria claimed a place at the 2010 World Cup at the expense of their great rivals. Back in the Caribbean, the disagreement over what happened to the team continues to cause diplomatic tension. Jamaican medical officials forced the squad to stay in hospital, after three of the party displayed symptoms of malaria -- but the approach was heavy-handed according to the head of Haitian soccer. ""The medical team were repressive, aggressive and hostile,"" Dr Yves Jean-Bart, president of the Haiti Football Federation who accompanied the players on their trip to the tournament, wrote in his official report seen by CNN. ""They were not allowed to eat or shower despite being declared sick with borderline temperatures."" The rest of the group, despite refusing, were made to take anti-malaria drugs and then quarantined in their hotel by armed security guards until their failure to field a team against El Salvador confirmed elimination from the tournament. The Haitian FA described the move as ""Machiavellian"" in the report mentioned above. As soon as the Haiti contingent landed back on home soil, the crisis escalated and both governments became involved. Cue a flurry of communications from, among others, Jamaica's Prime Minister Bruce Golding, claiming the country's dealings with the Haitian delegation were entirely legitimate and in line with its health protocols. Golding told the Jamaican House of Representatives he regretted how the issue had been ""sensationalized"" and that language problems between the two parties may have exacerbated the situation. But Jean-Bart persisted to note in his official report that his players had received ""psychological aggression"" and ""medical persecution"" at the hands of their Jamaican hosts. He told CNN that as far as he is concerned ""the matter is not closed ... because it's a discrimination act against our Haitian people. Jamaica has to apologize to our young players before relations are restored."" Myrtha Desulme, president of the Haiti-Jamaica Society in Kingston, told CNN that Haitians on every continent would be ""outraged at this last indignity meted out to their children."" She claims the entire country is still suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder after the devastating earthquake that tore the country apart in January 2010. She added: ""Even though the Haitian authorities might have accepted to officially close the book on the football issue, due to incapacity, Haitian civil society, both in Haiti and in its diaspora, continues to feel appalled and indignant about the incident. ""These children have been traumatized for life, on the way to achieving their dreams, and they were unfairly and illegally prevented from competing, which they had rightfully earned the right to do. ""Can you imagine what it must have been like for these 15 and 16-year-olds, who were so excited to be living what was probably the greatest adventure of their young lives, to be ... treated like criminals, and thrown out of the host country, just because two team players fell ill? ""Until Jamaicans know the truth of what transpired, they will continue to feel that Haitians have no right to feel hurt, angry, and outraged. As long as Jamaicans do not understand the source of their indignation, Haitians will continue to be incensed and resentful. ""There can be no reconciliation until there is full acknowledgement of the truth, apologies, and forgiveness."" Jamaica contests such allegations. After meeting with a delegation sent by Haiti's government to examine the dispute, Jamaica's Deputy Prime Minister Dr. Kenneth Baugh said: ""It should be obvious that Jamaica never intended for the Haitians to feel that they were subjected to discrimination. Our objective is to resolve and bridge the gap."" Olivia Grange, Minister of Youth, Sports and Culture, said in a statement that the other nations in the tournament were subject to the same medical testing Haiti received and that their quarantine was not restrictive. She said that Jamaica did not ""expel"" Haiti from the tournament, explaining that they had decided to withdraw in consultation with the footballing authorities. Haiti will have noted as they wait to see if they will be granted special dispensation to play in the under-17 World Cup by FIFA, that Grange also congratulated the Jamaican team on their qualification. It appears as if this latest disagreement to be sparked by soccer may take a while to blow over.","Jamaica and Haiti are embroiled in a dispute that arose over soccer .

"(CNN) -- Jockeyed by a man who'd never ridden it in a race, Animal Kingdom made a late charge Saturday to win the 137th edition of the Kentucky Derby. The colt's owners tapped John Velazquez to ride Animal Kingdom earlier this week, replacing jockey Robby Albarado after he got hurt while riding another horse. Velazquez is a racing veteran, but his best finish in 12 previous Kentucky Derby tries had been second in 2001. He had been slated to ride this year's pre-race favorite, Uncle Mo, until that horse was forced out after developing a gastrointestinal illness. ""It was a loss for Robby, and a win for me,"" a bittersweet Velazquez told NBC in an interview broadcast throughout Churchill Downs after the race. ""I'm very proud (of Animal Kingdom)."" The colt entered the Derby at 20-1 odds, starting from the outside from the No. 16 gate. It stayed in the back of the pack -- behind front-runner Shackleford, which ended up in fourth -- before pushing ahead around the final turn to cruise to a clear victory. The Kentucky-bred 3-year-old had run only a handful of races prior to Saturday, none of them on dirt. ""He's just kind of a magnificent animal,"" said Graham Motion, the trainer for Animal Kingdom. ""This is an amazing horse, a very special horse."" Two horses with much better 9-1 odds -- Nehro and Mucho Macho Man -- finished second and third, respectively. The latter was trained by Katherine Ritvo, who overcame a debilitating heart condition and was trying to become the first woman to train a Derby winner. The pre-race favorite, Dialed In, was never a factor. The wide-open race took place in front of 164,858 people, the most ever to attend the nation's longest continuously running annual sports event, a track official announced. The 19 horses and their riders broke shortly after 6:30 p.m., all galloping around the 1.25-mile dirt course in hopes of taking home a $2.17 million purse. According to the derby's website, more than $22 million was bet at the track -- topping last year's $21.5 million, with neither figure including many millions more wagered at sites outside Louisville. The derby is the first leg of the Triple Crown, considered the most coveted achievement in thoroughbred racing. It is followed by the Preakness Stakes in Baltimore, Maryland, and the Belmont Stakes in Elmont, New York. Animal Kingdom will now try to join the last horse to win all three -- Affirmed in 1978. CNN's David Ariosto contributed to this report.","Animal Kingdom, jockeyed by John Velazquez, entered with 20-1 odds .

"Pyongyang, North Korea (CNN) -- North Korea's reclusive leader, Kim Jong Il, made another rare public appearance Sunday with his youngest son at a massive military parade billed as one of the largest in the nation. Dignitaries from around the world, including China, Russia, Nepal, Poland, Austria and Mongolia, attended the event. It featured 20,000 military personnel marching in lockstep and huge pieces of military hardware -- including tanks and missiles -- rolling along the parade route as part of North Korea's celebration marking the 65th anniversary of the Workers' Party of Korea. Video from the event showed thousands of military personnel erupt into applause and chants as the Kims appeared in the capital to start the parade. Fireworks lit up the sky and, according to the state-run KCNA news agency, ""the ever-changing sea of dancers and flowers and ships and boats (were) decorated with multi-color lights."" According to KCNA, the gala was made up of performances with names such as ""Country where leader's desire has come into full bloom"" and ""Party is guide of victory."" Brass bands played songs including ""Song of General Kim Jong Il,"" KCNA reported. ""It's an annual holiday, but in effect this is an elaborate coming out party for the man who will be the next leader,"" said CNN's Alina Cho, referring to Kim's youngest son while reporting from the parade. The parade began in the Kim Il Sung Square, named for Kim Jong Il's father and North Korea's founder. The United States believes Kim Jong Un has been tapped to replace his ailing father as North Korea's leader. Little is known about Kim Jong Un. He is thought to be 27 or 28, is believed to have been schooled abroad and is thought to be capable of speaking some English and German, and possibly some French. He is said to have a fondness for Michael Jordan and James Bond. In a move that surprised North Korea observers, Kim Jong Un appeared to be wearing civilian clothes instead of his military uniform and medals, even though he had been named a four-star general last month. ""This is ... Kim Jong Il trying to make sure that senior military officers are not offended by someone who just got his start,"" said Gordon Chang, a North Korea expert and columnist for Forbes.com. ""It shows he needs to massage this process."" In a rare embrace of the media, Pyongyang invited about 60 journalists from around the world to cover the weekend's festivities, Cho said. ""We were quite hastily invited at the middle of last week,"" she said. ""We knew something big was happening but we weren't entirely sure what."" Cho said that security is tight and that even the news media's government minders are being checked by security personnel -- along with Cho's notebook and pen. Sunday's parade encompassed units of the three services of the Korean People's Army -- the Korean People's Internal Security Forces, the Worker-Peasant Red Guards and the Young Red Guards -- according KCNA. On Saturday, Kim and his heir apparent appeared at Pyongyang's May Day Stadium as part of the Arirang celebration. The event featured hundreds of gymnastics and dance performances. Participants spent up to eight hours a day training and preparing for the occasion. Performers danced enthusiastically for the crowd in the packed stadium. Kim Jong Il and Kim Jong Un could be seen sitting in a private box removed from the masses, flanked by military officials. Electricity was on throughout Pyongyang on Saturday, Cho said, an unusual occurrence in power-starved North Korea. The spare-no-expense celebration will likely be frowned upon by many ordinary North Koreans, Chang said. ""With the North Korean economy trending downwards, with poverty and destitution, there's got be the question of the nature of the regime,"" he said. ""They're going to look at this and say, 'Why don't I have clean water? Why don't I have food? How can they afford all of this?'"" Chinese President Hu Jintao sent Kim Jong Il a congratulatory message Saturday, commending the party for ""overcoming difficulties and risks and arduously struggling to continuously make eye-catching achievements in its socialist revolution and construction cause,"" China's state-run Xinhua news agency quoted Hu as saying. Hu also praised the relationship between North Korea and China, and pledged to make ""it an unswerving policy to continuously strengthen and develop bilateral friendly and cooperative ties."" CNN's Adam Reiss contributed to this report.","North Korea's leader Kim Jong Il attends a huge military parade Sunday .

"(CNN) -- Spanish striking legend Raul Gonzalez scored his 70th European Champions League goal to help Schalke to a superb 5-2 San Siro victory over holders Inter Milan in their quarterfinal first leg. An extraordinary match began in remarkable fashion when Inter took the lead after just 27 seconds. Schalke goalkeeper Manuel Neuer raced out of his area to head away an Inter attack, but he left his goal unguarded as Dejan Stankovic fired the ball home from the halfway line with stunning accuracy for one of the goals of the season. However, the German Bundesliga side levelled in the 17th minute when Inter failed to deal with a corner and Joel Matip was given space to blast the ball home. The tie swung Inter's way again in the 34th minute when they re-took the lead, Diego Milito -- the hero of last year's final win over Bayern Munich -- volleying home unmarked from close range after Esteban Cambiasso cushioned his header back across goal from the Inter right. But that advantage lasted for just six minutes before Edu netted on the rebound from a tight angle after goalkeeper Julio Cesar only parried his initial weak effort. The visitors took the lead for the first time eight minutes after the break when Raul held off Andrea Ranocchia to fire past Cesar -- and they increased their advantage four minutes later as defender Ranocchia diverted Jurardo's cross into his own net. The home side's hard task was made almost impossible when they had defender Cristian Chivu sent off in the 62nd minute for a second yellow card. Schalke continued to pour forward, looking to kill the tie off. Jurardo struck the post with a low shot and Jefferson Farfan also hit the woodwork from close range. But a fifth goal was not long in coming and Schalke surely made the second leg in Gelsenkirchen irrelevant with 15 minutes remaining when Edu turned and curled home a remarkable fifth goal.","Schalke stun Inter Milan 5-2 in a remarkable Champions League quarterfinal .

"Fort Campbell, Kentucky (CNN) -- President Barack Obama met Friday afternoon with members of the military team responsible for conducting the raid on Osama bin Laden's compound, and promised a war-weary nation victory over al Qaeda. ""We are ultimately going to defeat al Qaeda,"" the president told more than 2,300 troops who recently returned from Afghanistan. ""We have cut off their head."" ""Our strategy is working and there is no greater evidence of that than justice finally being delivered to Osama bin Laden,"" he declared. ""We're still the America that does the hard things, that does the great things."" The president made his remarks at Fort Campbell, Kentucky, home to the Army's 101st Airborne Division and the 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment, the group that operated the helicopters used in the raid. Bin Laden death leaves roots of terror untouched . While at Fort Campbell, the president, along with Vice President Joe Biden, privately met with members of Navy SEAL Team 6, the unit that conducted the raid. Among the SEALs that Obama met was the one who fired the fatal shots at bin Laden, but that person was not singled out to the president, a senior administration official told CNN. The president met a canine that was also part of the operation, according to the official. Obama visits ground zero; honors victims of 9/11 . Obama and Biden thanked the commandos and were briefed on the operation by the unit members who conducted it, according to a White House official. Obama awarded Presidential Unit Citations to the units involved in the Pakistan mission, the official said. The citation is the highest such honor that can be given to a military unit. ""They practiced tirelessly for this mission, and when I gave the order they were ready,"" the president told the troops. ""They're America's quiet professionals."" It was a ""job well done,"" he said. Trove of data found at bin Laden home . Friday's visit to Fort Campbell came a day after Obama's first presidential visit to New York's ground zero, the focal point of bin Laden's 9/11 terror attacks. It also came one day after a nationwide alert was issued regarding rail security, the first terror threat notification linked to materials found during the raid on the Abbottabad compound in Pakistan. The terror plot was planned for the anniversary of the 9/11 attacks. As early as February 2010, al Qaeda members discussed a plan to derail trains in the United States by placing obstructions on tracks over bridges and valleys, the alert said, according to one law enforcement official. No specific rail system was identified in the plans for the attacks, the official said. With bin Laden's death, there has been a growing call among some lawmakers to immediately withdraw the 130,000 U.S. and allied troops still battling the late al Qaeda leader's followers and his Taliban allies. Did bin Laden's wife rush Navy SEALs? Obama has repeatedly said he is confident the United States can meet a self-imposed deadline to begin bringing troops back home in July without compromising Afghan security, though military commanders and government officials have raised concern about the readiness of Afghan security forces. Lawmakers also have started questioning the U.S. relationship with Pakistan. During a Senate Foreign Relations committee hearing Thursday, legislators on both sides of the aisle said a new approach to Pakistan is now needed. Pakistan's government is ""very irrational,"" said Sen. Bob Corker, a Tennessee Republican. But Pakistani Foreign Secretary Salman Bashir said it is a ""false charge"" to assert that Pakistani authorities did not go after bin Laden. He said his country's intelligence agency alerted the United States about the presence of al Qaeda operatives in Abbottabad as early as 2004. Former Pakistan intel chief: Obama lying . Pakistani armed forces chiefs issued a statement Thursday admitting that there had been ""shortcomings in developing intelligence"" on the terror leader's presence in the country. The army chief of staff, Gen. Ashfaq Parvez Kayani, also ""made it very clear that any similar action, violating the sovereignty of Pakistan, will warrant a review on the level of military/intelligence cooperation with the United States,"" the statement said. Pakistan has ordered U.S. military personnel on its territory drawn down to the ""minimum essential"" level in the wake of the raid, the statement said. Anti-U.S. sentiment was growing in Abbottabad, where about 600 demonstrators gathered Friday at a rally, chanting ""Go America, go America, your show is over.""
