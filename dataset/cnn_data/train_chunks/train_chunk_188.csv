"(Lonely Planet) -- Fashion, food and music all take their cues from the past, so why not a little travel with a vintage twist? Here's our down-the-years guide to yesterday's holidays, with suggestions for how you can get a little taste of more -- or less -- glamorous eras. 1910s . As the twentieth century began travel overseas was the preserve of the wealthy and was starting to assume some of the grandeur we associate with this era. It was all possible thanks to boiling water, which became the steam that turned the turbines on steam trains and ships. This was the start of the ocean liner era -- passenger carrying airships were decades away -- with companies competing for speed, size and luxury. The Cunard ship Mauretania, launched in 1907, held the speed record for crossing the Atlantic for twenty years. Lonely Planet: 7 ways to experiment with travel . How to do this today: Cruises are more popular than ever before, but only Cunard's transatlantic crossings between Southampton and New York preserve the spirit of travelling to get somewhere rather than boarding to eat and drink vast amounts while trying to sneakily sleep with fellow passengers. The Queen Mary 2 (diesel driven) is the only vessel sailing a transatlantic schedule each year. Fares start at Â£699 including a flight home from your destination. 1920s . Fast forward past the First World War into the decadent 1920s. Whatever people did it involved jazz playing in the background and an elegantly-poised cigarette holder in their hand. The spirit of the age took people to the French Riviera, maybe Nice, Cannes or St Tropez, but certainly to the house of someone rich and famous who would host with G&Ts, dips in the deep blue Med and spare barely a thought for the penniless rabble about to get blindsided by the Depression. How to do this today: The south of France remains a magnet for glam travel -- it's just much cheaper to visit than it used to be. For starters, Nice is something of a budget air hub, serving destinations across Europe, and is also an excellent base for exploring the region. A stroll along the city's Promenade des Anglais is evocative of another age, no matter where you're staying. 1930s . The giant Zeppelin airship is the iconic image of this decade, and it was these mammoth beasts that carried long-distance airborne traffic throughout the 1930s. The most famous of these, the ill-fated Hindenburg, carried between 50 and 72 passengers. It was 243 meters long -- over three times as long as an Airbus A380, the largest commercial plane in service. It also took 68 hours to reach Recife, Brazil from Germany. How to do this today: California is one of the few places you'll find airships today. Airship Ventures offer tours of the San Francisco Bay Area and other parts of California, with flights starting at $375 for 45 minutes. 1940s . Tourism in many places ground to a halt in the 1940s, but American trains enjoyed boom years before the post-war rise of the automobile. Comfortable, sleekly-liveried services operated high-speed, long-distance services with evocative names like the Pioneer Zephyr and 20th Century Limited. Think shiny cutlery serving fine fare inside equally shiny trains. How to do this today: Some great American rail services still operate. The Empire Builder leaves Chicago's iconic Union Station each day, bound for Seattle or Portland. The 2200-mile journey takes 46 hours and features cheese and wine tasting along the route. 1950s . While for some, the 50s were about the development of a political ideology from the back of a bike in South America or road trips across America, (think Jack Kerouac's classic ""On the Road""), for others they were as glamorous as the days of pre-war hedonism. The Jet Age, ushered in by entry into service of the Brit-built De Havilland Comet in 1952 means travel becomes sleek, fast and fun. How to do this today: Cocktails in Cuba recall the pre-revolutionary island vividly portrayed in The Godfather, Part II. El Floridita in Havana may be a popular spot for a tourist tipple, but you know you're following in some famous footsteps. Lonely Planet: How not to behave on an airplane . 1960s . The 60s were the decade that travel changed forever. The advent of mass tourism introduced a generation of northern Europeans to just how quickly the Spanish sun could turn you lobster pink, and forever transformed sleepy fishing villages into brash, in-your-face holiday resorts. Even today, the straw donkey remains an iconic souvenir of this time, and one redolent of stellar tackiness. How to do this today: The digital age ushered in choice and flexibility to a sunshine holiday. Now you can come and sizzle on the costa of your choice via traditional package or budget flight and self-catering apartment. And going is still the only way of securing a straw donkey which, astonishingly, cannot be purchased online. 1970s . While Mum and Dad were schlepping to the Costa del Sol (or other fashionable costa), rebellious teenagers dropped out and headed for Kathmandu. Overland. The Hippy Trail was at its zenith in the 1970s, bringing to various parts of the Middle East and Central Asia gaggles of long-haired kaftan-wearing westerners, fugs of smoke and impromptu yoga sessions. How to do this today: Crossing Iran and Pakistan takes a little more planning than it did 40 years ago, and Kabul is not the crossroads it once was. Anyone heading from Istanbul to Nepal will find there is still a Freak Street in Kathmandu, complete with chocolate cake, dreadlocks and all the tie-dye you can handle. 1980s . The 80s brought wider horizons for millions of younger travelers as an adventurous few months on the road gained popularity. The European rail pass -- whether InterRail or Eurail -- was at the peak of popularity. This excellent value way to cross the continent didn't just link big cities and idyllic rural branch lines, it also brought together penniless travelers from around the world for a month-long series of rolling parties. Not that anyone even vaguely attractive wanted to talk to you, as you hadn't had a wash since Belgrade a fortnight ago. How to do this today: InterRail is still around, and still a great way to explore Europe. In fact, you can combine it with budget flights to avoid back-tracking. The true connoisseur will take the time-honored option of sleeping on the free ferry from Italy to Greece, under the Adriatic stars. 1990s . In the early 1990s the world opened up to travelers, with previously hard-to-reach places emerging from decades of isolation. From the Soviet Union to Central America, this was a decade of blazing new trails. And as the decade ended, improved transport and communication links meant more places were accessible as well as safer, and you could reliably phone home to brag about it. How to do this today: The old world continues to meet the new in Hong Kong, which began the 1990s as part of the British Empire and finished it as a Special Autonomous Region of China. The cream teas and Rolls Royces at the Peninsula Hotel are still here but they've been joined by fast rail links to the rest of China and ranks of new skyscrapers jostling for space on the city's famous skyline. 2000s . How dull flying must have been when we had our bags taken from us with little fuss then receive an assigned seat and a complimentary meal, before arriving at a convenient rather than remote airport for our destination! And yet, before low-cost carriers swept the globe, this was what came as standard when flying. By the time the decade was out, flag carriers were in retreat for all but long-haul flying and a 60km journey to central Oslo had become part of the fun. How to do this today: Take a weekend break to an obscure destination in eastern Europe. Bydgoszcz, Poland or Plovdiv, Bulgaria both fit the bill.

"(CNN) -- The arts are thriving around the Arabian peninsula. From Doha to the smallest state of the United Arab Emirates, museums and galleries are making an ambitious mark on the Middle East's cultural landscape. On display are not only artistic expressions ranging from the ancient to the contemporary but also a showcase of the ethnic diversity and rich heritage of the region. In Doha, the capital of Qatar, the Museum of Islamic Art stands on its own man-made island, just off the city's waterfront. ""It's not only about the religion itself, but it talks about the combination of cultures, the people of different ethnic groups all coming together to produce this wonderful art,"" says Aisha al-Khater, the museum's director. The museum, which has only been around for five years, has become one of Doha's most popular tourist attractions. The collection inside spans over 14 centuries and includes artifacts such as ceramics, carpets and coins. Even the building is something of a work of art: it was designed by the renowned Chinese American architect I.M. Pei. Read more: Camel beauty pageant in the UAE . The museum is not just about preserving the past but also a part of Qatar's efforts to rival Paris or New York as a cultural hub. Doha's massive Arab Modern Art Museum and the planned Qatar National Heritage Museum are other examples of venues that have been built there recently. ""Most people think of this as an oil rich country,"" says Dina Bangdel, director of art history at Virginia Commonwealth University in Qatar. ""Both museums, galleries are really saying the opposite. They're saying, 'you know, we have a rich heritage.'"" And it is not just Qatar. From Saudi Arabia to Kuwait, countries across the region are investing big in arts and culture. Abu Dhabi, the capital of the United Arab Emirates, recently constructed its own branch of the Louvre, due to open in 2015. A branch of the Guggenheim is scheduled to follow. Its neighbor Dubai holds one of the region's biggest art fairs, as well as international auctions where artwork changes hands for millions of dollars. Read more: Babylon's slow revival . And the small emirate of Sharjah within the UAE has managed to establish one of the liveliest contemporary art scenes in the region. At this year's Sharjah Biennale, an art festival held every two years, much of the art focuses on culture, and many pieces are displayed in courtyards. ""Courtyard is a metaphor for a public and yet private space and an architectural space and a place to bring people from different cultures and nationalities,"" said Hoor Al Qasimi, the president of the Sharjah Art Foundation. Sharjah's government funds the biennale, as well as the Emirate's well-preserved heritage areas, its authentic bazaars and its 16 museums. ""We have the largest art museum in the Gulf region,"" says Manal Ataya, the director of the government's Museums Department. ""We have the largest Islamic museum in the region, and I think in terms of variety, we definitely have the largest."" Wafaa Bilal, an artist and assistant arts professor at New York University was recently commissioned by a government-sponsored gallery to create an interactive sculpture that celebrates the Arab contribution to optics. He sees the government making a concerted effort to emphasize art in public spaces. ""It looks like it is a very meaningful, deliberate attempt on the part of the government here to make Sharjah the cultural hub of the region,"" Bilal says. ""And you see so much resources and effort put into this because at the end, culture and art, it is really the record of every nation."" Video: White water rafting on Iraq's threatened rivers . Yet, in Sharjah and throughout the region, artists and galleries must still contend with a degree of social conservatism. While the UAE is relatively liberal among Gulf nations, Sharjah is its most conservative emirate. At the previous biennale, an art installation was taken down following a public outcry over sensitive language in the piece. The director at the time was fired, while the event was accused of censorship. Al Qassemi says even with incidents like these, the multiple points of view reflect a richness that has developed in the contemporary art world. Also, sometimes it is a matter of law, she says. ""I think with any laws of many countries, there are restrictions in terms of law what you can or can't do, but outside of that I think people are very open to discussion,"" she says. This article was previously published referencing the 'Arabian Gulf' which is not in accordance with CNN's style guide.","From Saudi Arabia to Kuwait, countries across the region are investing big in arts and culture .

"(CNN) -- Thirteen-year-old Anjali didn't just pack her bags and run away to the circus, she signed a 10-year contract with a circus master after fleeing from long hours of domestic servitude in Nepal. Taken to India, she then endured years of appalling and dangerous working conditions for no pay. A British charity helped Anjali finally say goodbye to the circus. Anjali's story is not the same as other victims, but there are disturbing similarities: threats, sexual and labor exploitation, often cruelty, sometimes brutality. (To read Anjali's story, please go to UNODC's 2013 publication, Hear Their Story. Her name was changed to protect her identity.) Despite her terrible experiences, Anjali is one of the fortunate ones. There are millions of women, children and men across the world who face similar experiences. Human trafficking is now worth around $32 billion annually to the criminals and their networks. It is one of the world's most profitable crimes. I recently attended a debate on human trafficking at the U.N. General Assembly in New York. Other speakers included Oscar-winner Mira Sorvino, UNODC's good will ambassador against human trafficking. She spoke with dignity and with passion, which found echoes in the words of many of the other speakers, including U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon. The debate ensured that this crime remains on the radar screens of U.N. member states, one decade after the Trafficking in Persons Protocol entered into force. There is also some good news. Today, 83% of countries have proper legislation to combat human trafficking. In 2009, this figure was only 60%. So far, 175 states are parties to the Convention against Transnational Organized Crime and 154 are party to the Trafficking in Persons Protocol that is the foundation for our work against this heinous crime. Fifteen countries have also ratified the protocol since 2010. This, however, leaves 39 member states who still have to ratify the protocol and unite the entire world against human trafficking. Impunity is another festering issue. Sixteen percent of countries have never recorded a single conviction for human trafficking. Conviction rates remain low. CNN Freedom Project: Rescued Nepalese find new life in circus . Based on UNODC's Global Report on Trafficking in Persons 2012, between 2006 and 2009, the number of detectable cases of human trafficking for forced labor doubled from 18% to 36%. It shows that more action against this crime is being undertaken by law enforcement bodies, but there is room for improvement. There are also problems with data collection and analysis. Our human trafficking report contained information from 132 Member States. Almost a third of countries failed to provide information to the report. Fortunately, there is an international road map: the 3-year-old Global Plan of Action. The plan created the Victims Trust Fund managed by UNODC. So far, the fund has enabled 11 grass-roots organizations to aid victims in situations similar to that of Anjali. But the improvements, while encouraging, are coming too slowly to help the millions of victims. What is needed is a catalyst. My suggestion is an inspirational, but realistic goal: a decade of concrete action to end human trafficking. Action founded on international cooperation and coordination. Arrests made in modern slavery case . If we are truly serious about confronting this issue, I would suggest four steps to immediately improve the situation: . First, increased victim protection and support, second, universal ratification and full implementation of the U.N. Convention against Transnational Organized Crime, as well as its protocol; third, fresh contributions to the Trust Fund from governments, the private sector and the public to assist field organizations; and fourth, the provision of comprehensive data to understand the nature of this global crime. Legislation, however, is only the springboard for action. Every country needs a national action plan closely linked to regional and international efforts to counter human trafficking. We also need to hunt down the proceeds flowing from this ugly crime. Preventing money laundering means working closely with banks and the financial sector to report suspicious financial movements and creating a virtuous circle among financial intelligence units, law enforcement bodies and prosecution authorities. But, it is not good enough to simply imprison the guilty traffickers, we must take their money and close down the networks and trafficking routes for good. I am aware of the dangers of making unrealistic promises, but I believe we can achieve this goal. After all, our reach should always exceed our grasp. Let's turn the hourglass over and begin a decade of action to try to rid the world of the misery and suffering caused by human trafficking. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Yury Fedotov .","Millions of people fall victim to human trafficking, says Yury Fedotov .

"(Mental Floss) -- Work hard, get promoted, succeed in your new post, and eventually you'll start earning the big money. This progression seems like a firmly ingrained part of the American Dream, and it's certainly worked for a lot of people. Michael Ovitz spent $6 million on office renovations, Lakers tickets, and a BMW, among other expenses. However, these steps aren't absolutely necessary to fatten your bank account, as Washington Mutual CEO Alan Fishman learned last week. When WaMu failed and was seized by government regulators, Fishman had been on the job for just 17 days. However, he was contractually guaranteed $11.6 million in cash severance on top of the $7.5 million signing bonus he got for taking the job. Basically, Fishman netted just under $20 million for 17 days of work, which is a pretty nice setup for the head of a collapsing corporation. (In Fishman's defense, it's tough to blame WaMu's failure on his leadership alone; it seems highly unlikely that any CEO, however determined, could crash such a large thrift in just two weeks.) Fishman's not the only person to reap huge rewards for relatively little work. Here are few other well-compensated employees who didn't have to put in too many years of service: . 1. Michael Ovitz . After co-founding Creative Artists Agency in 1975, Ovitz quickly skyrocketed through the ranks of entertainment agents until he established himself as one of the most powerful men in Hollywood. In 1995, though, he left CAA to become president of Disney. Ovitz's tenure at Disney was stormy; he clashed with CEO Michael Eisner, who didn't share Ovitz's penchant for delegation. Ovitz also racked up a $6 million tab for various expenses ranging from renovating his office, buying Lakers tickets, and purchasing a BMW. It quickly became obvious that Ovitz wasn't going to be a great fit at Eisner's Disney, so the board terminated his contract after just 16 months. While Ovitz put in more work than Alan Fishman did at WaMu, he also received a lot more cash: a severance package of stock and cash that was worth around $100 million at the time. As Disney's stock price rose, though, so did the value of the package; at one point Ovitz's take might have been as much as $140 million for those 16 months of work. Mental Floss: 5 leaders who spent their countries into the ground . 2. Billy Dee Williams . Critics raved about Aaron Eckhart's turn as Harvey Dent in this summer's The Dark Knight, and most couldn't help but mention that it was a marked improvement over Tommy Lee Jones' campy portrayal of Two-Face in 1995's Batman Forever. However, Jones wasn't the only man to portray Dent in that run of Caped Crusader films. Billy Dee Williams had the role of Dent in Tim Burton's 1989 film Batman. Although the role was a fairly minor one in that film, Williams allegedly took the part with the understanding that he would reprise the character in a sequel in which Two-Face would be one of Batman's antagonists. To this end he had a pay-or-play clause inserted in his contract that basically assured that if the Harvey Dent/Two-Face character appeared in a future Warner Bros. Batman film, Williams would play the role. If the director chose to cast another actor in the part, the studio would have to cough up a buyout to Williams. In the end, that's exactly what happened: when Tim Burton left the series' helm, Joel Schumacher took over and wanted to cast Jones in the part. Williams received a cash buyout to not be in Batman Forever, a deal most of the principals in the critical disaster probably wish they'd been offered themselves. Mental Floss: 5 campy facts about TV's Batman . 3. Carl Pavano . When a professional baseball player signs a new deal, he's pretty much guaranteed to pull in the cash regardless of whether or not he plays. If you want proof, just mention the name Carl Pavano to New York Yankees fans and watch as their faces contort in terror. After an early stint in Montreal and three fairly strong seasons in Florida, Pavano signed a four-year contract worth $39.95 million with the Yankees before the 2005 season. He then got injured. Frequently. The pitcher's ill-fated tenure in the Bronx included pretty standard baseball injuries like an elbow strain and some problems with his throwing shoulder, but he also had some booboos that made Yankees fans wonder if he might be cursed, including two broken ribs in a car crash and a disabled-list trip for bruised buttocks. In all, the Yankees shelled out that $39.95 million for Pavano to make 26 starts over the four-year span. To make matters worse, on the rare occasions when Pavano was healthy he wasn't very good at baseball. His best season with the Yankees saw him compile a 4.77 ERA and allow 1.47 baserunners per inning he pitched. Even Mike Hampton, baseball's other pricy-but-fragile starter, has to shake his head at those numbers. Mental Floss: 14 ridiculous clauses in baseball contracts . 4. Edward McSweegan . While he may not be as high profile or as well-paid as the other names on this list, McSweegan may have found the sweetest deal an average guy could find. In a coup ripped directly from one of George Costanza's daydreams, McSweegan claimed that he did nothing for seven years while employed as a scientist at the National Institutes of Health. In 2003 McSweegan told the Washington Post that he hadn't really been given any job responsibilities since 1996. Prior to that, he had been a researcher and program officer on Lyme disease, but he was removed from that position in 1995 for arguing with a sufferers' support group. Although he had a title as director of the U.S.-Indo Vaccine Action Program and a list of nominal duties associated with that role, McSweegan claimed that he only carried out the tiniest of tasks like ordering coffee. In exchange, he received a salary in the neighborhood of $100,000. When the NIH vehemently disputed McSweegan's story that he simply went to work and did nothing all day, he maintained that he never received any assignments. McSweegan would show up, sit in his office, and read to kill time. He took up fiction writing to fill his workdays and published a pair of novels he allegedly wrote while at the office. He told CBS in an interview that he also joined a health club near work ""just to sort of break up the day."" The most amazing part of McSweegan's story isn't that he managed to stay employed through this seven-year period, but that he received positive performance reviews from his superiors. He wryly explained to CBS, ""I guess I'm good at doing nothing."" For more mental_floss articles, visit mentalfloss.com . Entire contents of this article copyright, Mental Floss LLC.

"(CNN) -- Zach Sobiech is dying with grace, love, joy and optimism -- the kind that somehow makes us all feel more alive. When he was 14, Zach was diagnosed with osteosarcoma, a type of bone cancer that mostly strikes children. His prognosis wasn't great. Last May, with no more treatment options, he was given just a year to live. Zach turned 18 on Friday. On Saturday he went to prom with his girl, Amy. His high school class graduates next month. Zach began writing music after his cancer was diagnosed. His mom, Laura, was cleaning the family room downstairs last year when she found a folded-up piece of paper. She unfolded it to make sure it wasn't a homework assignment. ""I read through it and then I realized what I was reading,"" she says. It was his first song, ""Clouds."" Zach wrote it for himself and his family. He has since written many more. ""I fell down, down, down into this dark and lonely hole,"" he sings at the beginning of the song. His voice is beautiful, mellow -- kind of reminiscent of Jack Johnson's. When Zach's song was posted to YouTube it quickly went viral, getting more than 2.6 million page views. Now there's a new video you ought to see. On Monday, dozens of celebrities posted a love letter response -- joining forces to lip sync to Zach's voice, singing ""Clouds."" ""And we'll go up, up, up, but I'll climb a little higher,"" sing Jason Mraz, Anna Faris and Rainn Wilson. ""Go up in the clouds because the view's a little nicer up here, my dear,"" sing Bryan Cranston and Rachel Bilson, Ashley Tisdale and Colbie Caillat. ""It won't be long now,"" sing the Lumineers. ""If only,"" sings Sarah Silverman, ""I had a little bit more time."" It's a hello to Zach, and a farewell. It's a collective expression of love and gratitude. The motley crew of celebrities on the video was assembled by Wilson, an actor, and director/actor Justin Baldoni, who directed a short documentary about Zach for his compelling online reality series, ""My Last Days,"" which runs on Wilson's SoulPancake YouTube channel. ""Going out to see Zach in Minnesota was one of the greatest experiences of my life,"" says Baldoni. ""To make the choice to be happy despite whatever sad or tragic circumstances you may be living through ... he is this old soul who inspires everyone he meets. You leave and you think: 'I want to be a better person.'"" Watch Baldoni's film and you can see why. There's Zach, a fresh-faced Minnesotan teenager, in one of the opening frames, saying: ""I want everyone to know: You don't have to find out you're dying to start living."" He tells us at the beginning of the film: ""You know most people live kind of in the middle, in between 'all your dreams come true' and 'you're dying,' and it's a very comfortable place to live. I'm living on the two extreme ends, so you have really, really good days and you have really, really bad days."" He has lived on those extreme ends for the better part of the past four years. And how gloriously. Zach's sleeping most of the day now. His evenings are better. The other night he was able to muster up enough energy to bring out his guitar and play. ""It's those times when we remember how it used to be,"" says his mom. She tells me about a trip the family took last year, ""a sort of pilgrimage to Europe,"" with 10 intense days of sightseeing. ""We packed a lot into those 10 days,"" she recalls, ""and maybe these past 3Â½ years have been like that pilgrimage. I haven't had the chance to let it sink in. I don't let myself go to that place of grief. There will be plenty of time to think about what we have lost later."" ""Right now ... right now I feel really grateful,"" she continues. ""That is the core of what I feel. I still get up in the morning and look forward to the day."" And maybe, she says, that is the lesson here: that no matter where you are in life, look at what you have and be grateful. It's the kind of thing you hear all the time. Putting it into action takes some work sometimes. But there are always things in life to be grateful for, no matter where you are. Being grateful is the doorway to all sorts of other good things, says Laura. ""That's what Zach's always been really good at: recognizing what is good and being grateful for it. It's the first thing he seeks out, his starting point. He taught all of us how it's done."" Taylor Engel, one of the YouTube commenters on Zach's video, writes: ""Well, you got a 6', 220 pound man sobbing his face off here. Prayers and thoughts with you, Zach...I hope someday I can be half the man you've become."" I swallow a sob. Me too, I think as I watch the video. At that moment, Zach sings: ""And maybe someday I'll see you again. We'll float up in the clouds and we'll never see the end ...""","Zach Sobiech was diagnosed at 14 with osteosarcoma, a bone cancer .

"(CNN) -- An image juxtaposing a famous painting of lovers and the ruins of a building in Syria has gone viral, becoming a powerful symbol of the country's devastation from civil war. ""Freedom Graffiti,"" by Syrian artist-in-exile Tammam Azzam, digitally superimposes Austrian painter Gustav Klimt's masterpiece ""The Kiss"" -- a gilded image of lovers embracing -- over a bullet-ridden wall in Syria. Syria's civil war is now approaching its second anniversary. The United Nations estimated last month that the death toll in the conflict had surpassed 60,000. Azzam's image has gone viral since it was put online last week, attracting more than 35,000 ""likes"" and 25,000 ""shares"" on Facebook since Friday. While the artwork is a purely digital creation, Azzam, who fled to Dubai with his wife and daughter seven months into the conflict, told CNN he hoped to return to his homeland one day to create a physical version of the work. ""When I can return to Syria I have vowed to paint 'The Kiss' onto Syria's infrastructure,"" said the 33-year-old artist. ""I cannot say if it will be the same wall though, as who knows if it will still be standing."" Read also: Syrian artists fight Assad regime with satire . Azzam said he began creating digital art as a form of protest shortly after leaving his country -- where his parents remain -- because he did not want to fight in the army. The work was part of a series, ""The Syrian Museum,"" that was exhibited in a collection at Dubai's Ayyam Gallery, which represents Azzam, last year. The works referenced other European Masters such as Goya, Picasso and Da Vinci, he said, juxtaposing ""some of the greatest achievements of humanity with the devastation in my country.""","An image of Klimt's ""The Kiss"" superimposed over a destroyed Syrian building has gone viral .

"(Mental Floss) -- Behind every good war are many good women. Using their feminine (and in at least one case masculine) wiles, the following five spies would make James Bond proud. Noor Inayat Khan was posthumously awarded the George Cross for her spy service. 1. Mata Hari . While Margaretha Geertruida Zelle MacLeod (1876--1917) may not have caused World War I, she sure as heck kept it going. Having spent time in Java with her husband, Captain Campbell MacLeod, Margaretha returned to Holland and sued for divorce. To make ends meet she took up exotic dancing and the name Mata Hari (meaning ""the light of day"" in Malay). With her sensual performances becoming the attraction of the major European cities came the men and the gifts for her favors. Many of these favors came from royalty and high-ranking French and German military officers. As World War I progressed, both sides became suspicious that Mata was spying for the other side. The French eventually put her on trial and, although the charges were never proven, Mata Hari was convicted of espionage and was executed by a firing squad on October 15, 1917. Playing the seductress up until the end, Mata refused a blindfold, smiled, and blew a kiss to the firing squad as the fatal shots were fired. Mental Floss: When a criminal survives execution . 2. Noor Inayat Khan . Khan was born in 1914 and at a young age moved with her family first to England and then to France. In 1940, Khan, along with her mother and sister, escaped back to England just before France surrendered to Germany. While in England she joined the Women's Auxiliary Air Force (WAAF), but her ability to speak fluent French soon caught the attention of the Special Operations group and Khan agreed to become a spy. Khan was flown to Le Mans, where she teamed up with other female spies and traveled to Paris, France. There they joined the French Resistance Prosper Network. Soon after their arrival, the network was infiltrated and many were arrested. Khan was ordered to return to England, but instead she stayed on and continued to pass information on to England. Eventually she was arrested again and interrogated by the Gestapo. When she refused to speak, she was sent to a prison in Germany and then to the Dachau concentration camp. On September 13, 1944, Khan and three other female British spies were executed by the Nazi SS. In 1949, Khan was posthumously awarded the George Cross. 3. Belle Boyd (aka ""La Belle Rebelle"") Born Isabelle Boyd in Martinsburg, Virginia, in 1844, the beautiful Belle soon became the star attraction in Washington, D.C., social circles prior to the beginning of the Civil War. With the outbreak of the war, she returned to Martinsburg. When the Union soldiers occupied the city, Belle mixed with the officers and soon gathered information on troop movements, which she passed on to the Confederate forces. However, she is probably best known for warning Stonewall Jackson that the Union intended to blow up all the bridges around Martinsburg. With this information, Jackson, with a small number of troops, was able to surprise the Union troops and drive them from the area. In 1864, Confederate president Jefferson Davis asked Belle to carry letters for him to England. The Union Navy captured her ship, but the officer in charge fell in love with Belle and let her escape. The officer, Lieutenant Samuel Harding Jr., after being courtmartialed and discharged from the Navy, traveled to England, where he married Belle. After the war, Boyd toured the United States as an actress under the stage name of La Belle Rebelle. 4. Elizabeth Van Lew . Crazy Bet, as she was known, was born in Richmond, Virginia, in 1818 but educated at a Quaker school in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. After developing a hatred for slavery, Elizabeth returned to Richmond and freed all her family's slaves. She also went so far as finding where her freed slaves' relatives were and purchased and freed them also. After the Civil War started, Elizabeth asked to visit Union prisoners being held captive in Richmond. The Union prisoners gave her information, which she then passed on to the North. Among the slaves she freed was Mary Elizabeth Bowser, whom Van Lew got a job as a house servant in the home of Jefferson Davis. This allowed Bowser and Van Lew to collect and pass on information directly from the Confederate president's mansion. Elizabeth effectively used the Crazy Bet moniker to make the residents of Richmond think she was mentally ill. She would wear old clothes and bonnets and talk to herself. Because of this, most people thought that her Northern sympathies were just a part of her craziness. Mental Floss: Confederacy's plan to conquer Latin America . After the war, President Grant named Elizabeth the postmaster for Richmond. When the citizens of Richmond found out that Crazy Bet was an act, they shunned her. However, at her death, the state of Massachusetts placed a memorial marker on her grave. 5. Sarah Emma Edmonds (or Was It Frank Thompson?) Born in 1841 in New Brunswick, Canada, Sarah ran away from home in her early teens. In order to survive she became an itinerant Bible salesman, by calling herself Frank Thompson and dressing like a man. In 1861, Frank (Sarah) enlisted in the Second Michigan Infantry and over the next two years not only fought in a number of Civil War battles, but also served as a spy for the Union Army. Solders in her unit called Frank ""our woman"" because of his feminine mannerisms and his extremely small boot size. However, none of her comrades ever figured out that Frank was really Sarah.  Mental Floss: Celebrity or look-alike? This boded well for her spying, where she dressed as a young boy serving in Confederate camps, as an immigrant Irish peddler and, most interestingly, as a woman. In 1863, Sarah caught malaria and deserted the army out of fear that hospitalization would reveal her true identity. In 1884, though, Sarah applied for and was awarded a veteran's pension in which the secretary of war acknowledged that Sarah was a female soldier who had rendered faithful services to the ranks.

"Washington (CNN) -- A U.S. Coast Guard chopper responding to a possibly distressed boater off the South Carolina coast was forced to make an emergency landing when the pilot was temporarily blinded by a laser, the service said. The scare on Wednesday near Garden City Beach was the third time in as many weeks that Coast Guard pilots in that area, called the Grand Strand, have reported being disabled by sharp laser light. ""We've been very fortunate that the green laser incidents haven't yet resulted in tragedy,"" Coast Guard Cmdr. Gregory Fuller of Air Station Savannah said in a statement. In the latest incident, the chopper responded to reports of orange flares offshore. Following the emergency landing, another crew took over and continued the search. No distressed boater or any evidence of flares were found, the Coast Guard said. The Coast Guard is working with police to try to find out who is responsible. The pilot in this case was grounded for 24 hours before being cleared to fly again. It is unclear what type of laser might have been used in this case. But reports by commercial and private pilots of laser incidents nationally have jumped in recent years as hand-held technology has become readily available and easily used. Aviation safety officials and law enforcement are trying to curb the activity and are stepping up prosecutions. Phony Mayday calls vexing Coast Guard . Coast Guard officials have deemed the Grand Strand area of the South Carolina coast where pilots have reported lasers as very high risk, and now require crews to consider the possibility of a laser scenario before responding to a distress call. ""Every time we send our aircrews to the Grand Strand, we're telling them to fly into the equivalent of a storm, where it's almost guaranteed they'll be hit,"" Fuller said. ""We're simply asking the public to stop putting Coast Guard men and women in senseless and unnecessary danger."" It is a problem becoming all too frequent for pilots. The number of reported laser incidents involving aircraft in the United States has risen 26% from 2,836 in 2010 to 3,592 in 2011. It has more than doubled since 2009. ""Shining a laser at an airplane is not a laughing matter. It's dangerous for both pilots and passengers, and we will not tolerate it,"" Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood said in May. FAA Acting Administrator Michael Huerta has said federal authorities will ""aggressively"" prosecute violators under a new law that makes laser targeting a federal crime, and will not treat incidents with warning notices or counseling. The FAA and the Justice Department are pushing for stiffer penalties against those responsible for targeting aircraft. Since June last year, the FAA has started enforcement action against 28 people charged with aiming a laser device at an aircraft and has opened ""dozens of additional cases"" for investigation, the agency said. Dealing with these incidents on top of an increase in false mayday calls have frustrated Coast Guard officials. ""The biggest downfall is that their night vision is ruined, and they're flying blind. It's dangerous for the pilots and the crew. Their lives and the lives of the crew are at risk,"" Coast Guard Lt. Cmdr. Jamie Fredrick told CNN. CNN's Jim Barnett contributed to this report.","The Coast Guard chopper was responding to reports of flares off South Carolina coast .

"(CNN) -- ""It's about as difficult as assembling a cupboard from IKEA,"" says Gael Langevin, but he's not talking about an affordable piece of Scandinavian furniture. The 41-year-old French sculptor and model-maker is referring to his open-source, life-size, 3D-printed robot. Known as InMoov, Langevin's animatronic creation can be made by anyone with access to little more than a basic 3D printer, a few motors, a cheap circuit board and about $800. Langevin has been developing InMoov in his spare time since the beginning of last year and, he stresses, it's all still very much a work in progress. So far the robot boasts a head, arms and hands and the torso is not far off. On completion of each body part, Langevin shares the printer files and assembly instructions on his dedicated blog. ""I've also posted some programming instructions -- so you can make it respond to voice-activated commands,"" he says. ""It can grab hold of things, tilt its head and move its arms around in various ways ... and when I get around to building some legs, that's when things will get really interesting."" The project began when Langevin was asked to create to a prosthetic hand for a commercial photo shoot. He'd recently brought a 3D printer to play with at home, so thought this would be a ""good way to test it out,"" he recalls. Although he confesses to being a ""coding novice,"" Langevin taught himself how to use Arduino -- a very cheap and increasingly popular microcontroller -- so that he could get his prosthetic hand to move. He posted the bodiless limb to Thingiverse -- a digital design file sharing site -- and was swamped with enthusiastic responses. The users began printing and building their own versions, and wanted to see more. So Langevin obliged. ""Each individual part is small enough to be printed on the cheapest range of 3D printers available to the public"" he says, noting that most of the robots you read about are both prohibitively expensive and ""kind of ugly."" Despite the sci-fi appearance of his creation, Langevin's vision for the InMoov robot is remarkably quaint. ""It's something to make with the family on weekends,"" he says. ""When she was very young, my daughter said she wanted to build a plane and various other incredible things ... this robot shows you can build anything you like.""","French sculptor Gael Langevin has created life-like, affordable open-source robot .

"(CNN) -- Recently, one of the hottest trending articles on BuzzFeed was a picture collection of ""The 18 Worst Things For Left-Handed People."" I clicked on this story with the index finger of my dominant right hand. It was quite easy. I would do it again. The collection was cleverly put together by BuzzFeed editor Katie Notopoulos and featured simple things that, at least to us righties, aren't normally such a big deal. Clearly, this is because we are the chosen ones. Fortunately, I was chosen to do very little, and it works rather well with my current lifestyle. So long as we agree that power-binging on ""Breaking Bad"" counts as a lifestyle. Actually, to be completely fair, there's probably better evidence suggesting that, disproportionately, lefties are far more destined for greatness. Perhaps they are the true chosen ones. Consider, for example, that not only is Oprah Winfrey a lefty, but so too are three of our past four presidents. Plus they also get to claim Jimi Hendrix. And really, that's the one that counts. In a fantasy lefty draft, Hendrix goes first. Granted, that's also about as far as the draft continues before somebody asks, ""Wait, why are we doing this?"" All that said, our world is custom-fit for righties, and nobody would willingly choose to be left-handed. There's no tangible advantage. Unless, I suppose, you strategically parlay having a naturally weaker handshake into low performance expectations at the office. Which, mind you, isn't a horrible idea. My motto: Promise mediocrity. Deliver just slightly better. ""Nice job, Jarrett. This is ... decent."" Sports are arguably the only place where being a lefty might have benefits. Baseball needs left-handed pitchers. Soccer needs left-footed wingers and backs. And apparently there's a great advantage to being left-handed in fencing. But none of these translate into the real world, and one of the sports is, well, fencing. Understandably, then, lefties have a bit of a complex. Enough so that they've even created their own holiday on August 13. National Left Handers Day. They celebrate by spending the whole afternoon not being able to cut things with scissors. Righties, on the other hand (ugh -- I can't believe I just wrote that), don't have a holiday, and that seems a little unfair. Thus, I hereby declare July 27 as National Right Handed Pride Day. Our official Twitter hashtag: #CraigFerguson . (For absolutely no good reason whatsoever, I just crowned him King of the Righties. So, let's see if we can get it to trend. He'll be really confused.) But back to the trending BuzzFeed collection of worst things for lefties. The list actually begins with spiral notebooks and three-ring binders. These seem to be the bane of lefty student existence. In college I was keenly aware of this horrible injustice, and as an act of solidarity I refused to take notes. Or go to class. Or study. You're welcome. One more quick, noteworthy inclusion on BuzzFeed's list that's worth mentioning here is the standard can opener. This is sort of the poster child for left-handed culinary inequality, and I desperately wanted to know what it felt like to fail at peas. To experience the anguish, I stopped writing, went over to the kitchen, grabbed a can opener, turned the handle away from me and pried off a lid just like a lefty. Conclusion: It wasn't that hard. We really need to stop giving this device so much respect. Nevertheless, let's support the lefties in our lives. According to most expert estimates, roughly 10% of the population is left-handed. They're everywhere. And you probably know one. So, as we're here celebrating the very first National Right Handed Pride Day, take a moment to look a lefty in the eyes and offer a few words of encouragement. ""Dave, I just want you to know that despite the fact that you can't use a dry erase board, I respect you. But not as much as Craig Ferguson."" You're welcome.","""Apparently This Matters"" is a skewed look at trending social-media topics .

"(CNN) -- ""The Da Vinci Code,"" a film based on a novel from Dan Brown, opened three years ago amid controversy and protests. Now, a new film based on another Brown novel, ""Angels and Demons,"" opened on Friday. Ron Howard and Tom Hanks spoke with Larry King on Friday about their new film, ""Angels and Demons."" Larry King talked with the star of the movie, Tom Hanks, and its director, Ron Howard, about whether the new film will spark more controversy. The following is an edited version of the interview. Larry King: Ron, you held the world premiere in Rome, where the church is kind of sensitive about this. Why there? Ron Howard: The premiere screening was actually scheduled to be in one location. And about, I don't know, a week or so before we were supposed to have the premiere, the Vatican asked them not to let us use that facility. So we shifted it somewhere else. But otherwise, all went smoothly.  Watch Hanks, Howard discuss filming in Rome » . King: Tom,  you have kind of put your stamp on this: ""Angels and Demons,"" ""Da Vinci Code."" What attracted you to the project? Tom Hanks: Well, the intelligence and, I think, in some ways, the ambivalence of the character of Robert Langdon. He's a very smart guy. He's probably the only symbologist in the world, and his reading of the symbols, the history, is pushed through this sieve of knowledge that takes emotion and faith possibly out of any of the equations. He can look at something that would mean one thing to one culture, and it means something completely different in modern times or depending on what other culture it is. So as a selfish actor, it's great fun to play somebody as smart as Robert Langer. King: Was it a tough script to remember? Hanks: Well, you get into some pretty fascinating rigmarole. But, as we can all attest, we all end up having sort of like a seminar on all of these topics. We sit around for hours and discuss things like particle physics and what's it mean and the history of the Illuminati and who was and who was not a member of it. King: Ron, does controversy -- and this film has it -- help or hurt? Howard: I think it helps. In fact, it's part of what's interesting about what Dan Brown writes is, you know, it's thought-provoking stuff. Now, in ""Da Vinci Code,"" really, the controversial ideas were driving the movie more than the action, more than the suspense. It really was about presenting those ideas and making the argument for them and stirring that thought. This has its ideas, and it is smart and intelligent and interesting. But I would say that it's reversed. I think that the mystery, the code breaking, the thriller nature of it is, from a directorial standpoint, really out in front. Still, you know, it has its ideas. They are controversial. At least it gives people something to talk about and think about on the way home if they want to. King: Tom, as I understand it, ""Angels and Demons"" was written before ""Da Vinci Code,"" right? Hanks: Yes. It was written so long ago, in fact, that there was no Internet, there was no Google. Dan Brown, for some reason, presented the election of the pope as a minor story that is not really covered by the world's media. So it had some innate, I wouldn't say inaccuracies, but things that were taken out of time. It required a substantial amount of adaptation to the way life works in 2009. King:: Ron, does it bug you when many people in the Vatican, in the church, complain about the movie without having seen it or just basing it on they don't like Dan Brown? Howard: Well, you said it, Larry. I'm fully prepared to accept any criticism based on the movie. But, you know, it's absolutely frustrating if they're making an assumption. The idea here is to take any work of fiction, to build a thriller around a time when the church is in conclave. It's a heightened moment, and we all know that, at various times, the church, as any major institution experiences, has been compromised. And so some of the virtues are threatened by the personal agendas of those within it, and that's very human. In fact, you can read all about it in the Vatican bookstore. They'll tell you in history, you know, all about the number of times that that kind of thing has happened. So, Dan took inspiration from that kind of a circumstance and, I think, created a really interesting, exciting movie.","Ron Howard: Controversy helps new film, ""Angels and Demons""

"New York (CNN) -- A man who stabbed a New York City taxi driver three years ago after asking whether he was Muslim will serve 9Â½ years in prison. Michael Enright, 24, pleaded guilty two weeks ago to attempted murder in the second degree as a hate crime and assault in the first degree as a hate crime, the New York Supreme Court clerk's office said. Enright was sentenced Tuesday. In addition to his prison term, he must serve five years of post-release supervision, the clerk's office said. ""This was a horrendous crime against an innocent New Yorker. The victim, a native of Bangladesh and the father of four children, has been working and living in our diverse city for nearly three decades. There is no place for bigotry in New York City."" District Attorney Cyrus Vance said at Enright's guilty plea proceeding. The taxi driver, Ahmed Sharif, suffered slashes across the neck, face, shoulder and hand in the August 2010 attack, the New York Taxi Workers Alliance said. Enright made an eloquent statement to the court, blaming himself, taking responsibility for the crime and apologizing to the victim, his lawyer, Lawrence Fisher, told CNN on Wednesday. Fisher said he thought the sentence was ""severe"" for a case in which the victim was released from the hospital within hours. Prosecutors originally recommended 18 years in jail for Enright before dropping it to 9Â½ years. The minimum sentence is eight years, according to his lawyer. In previous court appearances, Enright's lawyer said his client suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder and alcoholism. After being released on bond with an ankle bracelet, Enright successfully completed both in- and out-patient alcohol rehabilitation, performed community service projects and attended Alcoholics Anonymous, where he became a lecturer and sponsor, according to Fisher. ""He's made great strides and has been clean and sober for over two years since he's been released,"" Fisher said. According to Bhairavi Desai of the Taxi Workers Alliance, Enright, then 21, allegedly began conversing with Sharif before asking whether he was Muslim. Enright then cursed and allegedly shouted, ""Assalamu alaikum, consider this a checkpoint."" ""Assalamu alaikum"" is an Arabic greeting that means ""peace be upon you."" Sharif was then stabbed. Bleeding profusely, he stumbled out of his taxi and managed to flag down a police officer who arrested Enright, the union representative said. Enright, who was a student at the School of Visual Arts in Manhattan, had shot a film on American soldiers serving in Afghanistan, said the director of Intersections International, a nonprofit group that partially funded the trip. Enright was intoxicated the night of the arrest, according to police, who found an empty bottle of scotch in his backpack. The attack occurred amid public debate over plans to build an Islamic cultural center and mosque to be called Park51 two blocks from the site of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center. CNN's Jessica Naziri and Ashley Fantz contributed to this report.","NEW: Defendant took responsibility, apologized, his lawyer says .

"(CNN) -- British Prime Minister David Cameron arrived Saturday in Pakistan for talks with President Asif Ali Zardari about building a ""strong relationship"" between Pakistan and Afghanistan, the prime minister's office said. Cameron acknowledged ""difficulties"" and ""blocks in the road"" to achieving that aim. The UK leader is also to discuss the potential for British business in Pakistan's growing economy. Cameron arrived from Afghanistan, where he made an unannounced visit Saturday and met with UK troops in Helmand province. He also spoke with Afghan President Hamid Karzai. While visiting with Karzai, Cameron said his country has ""a good relationship with Pakistan,"" the UK's Press Association news agency reported. Speaking in Kabul at press conference with Karzai, Cameron added that ""it's in Pakistan's short-, medium- and long-term interest to have a secure, stable and prosperous Afghanistan with which they have a good and strong relationship."" Pakistan-Afghanistan ties were ""always difficult, there are always blocks in the road, but I know that the president will see past them,"" Cameron said. Cameron's visit in Afghanistan coincided with Armed Forces Day, a series of events held across Britain on Saturday to recognize the contribution of the nation's servicemen and women, military veterans and their families. Speaking after talks with Karzai at the presidential palace in Kabul, Cameron said the two nations had a ""shared commitment to a strong partnership beyond 2014,"" the Press Association reported. But Cameron stressed that Britain would be withdrawing all combat forces from Afghanistan by the end of 2014, from which point it will offer financial support and run an officer training academy. There are currently 8,000 British servicemen and women serving in Afghanistan, alongside 68,000 from the United States, the largest contributor of troops. The NATO-led international coalition formally handed over security responsibility to Afghan national forces 10 days ago. They faced an early test of their capabilities Tuesday when a group of attackers stormed the entrance to the presidential palace in Kabul. The Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack in which three guards died, according to the government. UK Gen. Nick Carter, deputy commander of the NATO-led coalition in Afghanistan, told Britain's Guardian newspaper Saturday that he believes the West should have tried talking to the Taliban in 2002, in the aftermath of the 2001 invasion, to help find a political solution. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry has cast doubt in the past week on whether potential U.S. peace talks with the Taliban in Qatar will happen. The Taliban opened a Doha office this month with a promise to renounce international terrorism and commit to peace negotiations, conditions the United States had set before it would support establishing the office as part of peace talks. Asked about the prospect of such talks, Cameron said the political process would only succeed ""if those who are involved in the Taliban put down their arms and stop fighting,"" the Press Association reported. The coalition's plan is to withdraw all international combat troops by the end of 2014 but to keep a residual force in the country to help train Afghans and carry out counterterrorism operations when needed. The size of that force remains under discussion. CNN's Bharati Naik contributed to this report.","NEW: David Cameron says Pakistan ""will see past"" difficulties with Afghanistan .

"(CNN) -- They've taken contrasting routes to the Wimbledon final, have very different styles of play and polar opposite personalities, but Sabine Lisicki and Marion Bartoli will have one thing in common on Saturday afternoon on the famous Centre Court. Both will be searching for a maiden grand slam title -- the ultimate validation of their undoubted talents. Lisicki, who put out defending champion Serena Williams, the biggest upset in a tournament of massive upsets, also dispatched former grand slam champions Francesca Schiavone and Samantha Stosur en route to her first final at this level. Read: Serena stunned by Germany's Lisicki . 15th seed Bartoli came through almost unnoticed before thrashing Belgium's Kirsten Flipkens, herself a relative unknown, in the semifinal. Lisicki has a booming all-court game, which has earned her the tag ""Doris"" -- a reference to its similarity of the style of German legend Boris Becker. The three-time Wimbledon champion is also an admirer: ""Sabine Lisicki rocks,"" Becker tweeted as she beat fourth seed Agnieszka Radwanska in another three set nail biter in the semifinals. Bartoli's game is definitely not for the purist, with her own unique service action and double handed thumps on both wings. It's not pretty but effective as seven WTA career titles testify. In the 2007 Wimbledon semifinal she played Justine Henin, possessor of a classic backhand and No.1 seed at the time. She lost the first set lamely and trailed the Belgian in the second. Commentators were already lamenting the one-sided nature of the match before Bartoli confounded her critics to pull off a stunning upset. She lost to Venus Williams in the final, but the experience may prove a big advantage. Lisicki will look to ride the wave of support which has greeted her march to the title match. The 23-year-old has earned the affection of the crowds with her outgoing and cheerful personality. She has played with a permanent smile on her face even when apparently slipping to defeat against Williams and Radwanska. Wrapping up match point against the seemingly invincible Williams, she collapsed to the turf in joyful sobs. Her place in the affections of the fans was sealed. ""I love Wimbledon,"" she beamed after beating Radwanska and the feeling is mutual. Bartoli is an engaging eccentric, who reportedly brooded for months after taking the brave decision to dispense with the services of her father Walter as her coach. Former World No.1 Amelie Mauresmo has taken the job and is credited with damping down the inner turmoil which can undermine Bartoli's best efforts. So relaxed was the 28-year-old that she admitted to taking a half hour cat nap just before dispatching Flipkens. When asked about it, Bartoli replied ""I'm French,"" as if it offered an explanation for her unusual slumbers. It remains to be seen if the prospect of facing the lower ranked 23rd seed Lisicki in the biggest match of their careers will ruffle her newly found sang-froid. Lisicki has won three of their four matches, including a three-set quarterfinal match at Wimbledon in 2011 as the German first made her mark on her favorite grass. But Bartoli's single win over her came at Wimbledon back in 2008. It's certainly a final which absolutely nobody predicted at the start of the fortnight with bookmakers offering odds of 1500 to 1 on its prospect. There were clearly few takers with the safe bets on another Serena Williams -- Maria Sharapova showdown before the shocks started on the first Wednesday. Lisicki will be looking to become the first German to win a grand slam since Steffi Graf won her 22nd and final major at the 1999 French Open. Graf sent her a good luck text before she beat Radwanska. Perhaps it's fate, but the last French success at this level came to Bartoli's new mentor Mauresmo back in 2006 when she won two slams. Both finalists have had to overcome setbacks to reach the ultimate stage. Lisicki suffered a career threatening ankle injury in 2009, while Bartoli's recent slump in form and loss of confidence this year had seen her fail to go past the quarterfinal stage in any tournament before Wimbledon. It's safe to say that victory come Saturday tea time will change the life of one these young women forever as they claim their place in the tennis record books.","Sabine Lisicki and Marion Bartoli contest women's final at Wimbledon .

"(CNN) -- There is still much we don't know about what happened during the crash of Asiana Airlines Flight 214, in which two people were killed in San Francisco on Saturday. But we do know that of the 305 survivors on board that Boeing 777, 123 actually walked away from the scene, something that may seem unimaginable if you view the amateur video of the wide-body jet somersaulting while bursting into flames. The city's fire chief described the survival of so many as ""nothing short of a miracle."" But, although we persist in thinking divine intervention is the only thing that can save a flight in peril, it's no longer a miracle when even hundreds of passengers survive the worst of accidents. The ""miracle of Toronto"" and the ""miracle on the Hudson"" are just two examples of recent flight disasters in which everyone on board survived. And the danger of ""miracle"" thinking is that it lulls some passengers into not learning more about how best practices can save lives. Are all airline crashes survivable? Of course not. But the statistics tell the story. In 2001, the National Transportation Safety Board released an exhaustive study of U.S. airline accidents over a 17-year period and found that 95.7% of occupants survived. I wrote a book that focused on airline safety, and my research led me to interview dozens of aviation safety experts, including several who work for Boeing in Seattle. (The Asiana flight was on a Boeing 777.) In recent years, aircraft manufacturers have focused on a multipronged approach to survivability: In addition to accident avoidance, great strides have been made in helping occupants survive the impact, post-crash fires and fumes, and safely evacuate. Boeing experts told me that many of the most significant advancements in safety were developing safer materials for carpeting, seats, and other cabin components. These new materials reduce flammability and toxic fumes during those critical first minutes after a fire starts. Experts also pointed to improved evacuation slides, which historically suffered high failure rates during actual emergencies. But it isn't all about technological advancements; human factors also play a critical role. And here is where ""miraculous survival"" thinking is a danger: It can cause some passengers to not learn more about how best practices -- not miracles -- can save their lives. Even the most frequent fliers may not realize how simple actions can dramatically improve their chances of survival. I'm not suggesting that flying has to be a white-knuckle, continually vigilant experience. I am suggesting that you not zone out during ""key phases"" of the flight, such as takeoff, landing, severe turbulence, and irregular operations. Only 11% of fatal accidents happened at cruising altitude. Instead, consider the following to enhance your safety: . • Listen: You may be a veteran flier -- but that doesn't mean you don't need to pay attention during the preflight instructions. Emergency egress procedures can vary widely, even among similar aircraft types. • Dress smart: Wear comfortable, flat-heeled shoes that won't fall off easily. Flip-flops and high heels are the wrong attire for evacuation slides. Avoid highly flammable polyesters and pantyhose; think cotton and wool. • Seating: Choosing a seat involves many factors, but access to emergency exits may end up being the most important for you. Count the rows to the nearest exit, since you may need to find it under dark or smoky conditions. • Stay buckled: You know that admonition to always stay belted while you're in your seat? Do it. Severe turbulence can maim and even kill. • Secure your stuff: Loose items = projectiles. • Drinking/medications/sleeping: During key phases of flight, it's critical that you remain sharp. Booze and meds can severely impair your ability to follow instructions. • Strapping: The only safe place for a child under 2 years old is in an approved restraint system. Both the National Transportation Safety Board and the Federal Aviation Administration agree on this, though the FAA won't mandate that airlines ban children sitting in adults' laps. Don't believe that G-forces are for real? Take another look at the Asiana video; then imagine holding a child throughout that ordeal. In the years ahead, the airline industry may remember Asiana Flight 214 for another reason. An alarming number of passengers on Saturday took the time to retrieve their luggage -- even bags in the overhead bins, no less -- before evacuating that burning aircraft. Words fail when contemplating how such thoughtless actions threatened so many lives. So let's add this to the list: Don't even think about evacuating while carrying anything that isn't alive. Inevitably, some will scoff at learning more about survivability. I've read scores of armchair experts who assert that no one can walk away from a plane crash. Don't listen to them -- they can cost you or your loved ones your lives.

"(CNN) -- Americans gather every day in airports, movie theaters, playgrounds, town halls, shopping centers, houses of worship, schools, ball parks and sporting arenas. Unfortunately, these gatherings can be targets for acts of violence, particularly when they involve high-profile events. We are all safer when everyone is alert and engaged. And now the Department of Homeland Security is expanding its coordination -- with Major League Baseball, Major League Soccer, the National Basketball Association, the National Football League and the National Hockey League -- by releasing a new public service announcement today to tell their millions of fans: If you see something that doesn't look right, report it to local authorities. In other words, ""If You See Something, Say Something."" The campaign supports the DHS belief that homeland security begins with hometown security. We work closely with state and local governments and law enforcement, the private sector, faith-based and community groups, and the public to reduce risks and make our communities safer. Originally developed by the New York Metropolitan Transportation Authority, ""If You See Something, Say Something"" is a simple and effective program to raise the public's awareness of indicators of terrorism, and emphasize the importance of reporting suspicious activity to the proper authorities. This kind of reporting by citizens has helped foil numerous plots, including a planned attack against a Martin Luther King, Jr. Day parade route in Washington State in 2010. And when a concerned gun store owner became suspicious of a customer's purchases in Killeen, Texas, last year, he called the authorities and helped prevent a likely attack at Fort Hood. DHS has expanded the program by partnering with cities, states, universities and private businesses, including the transportation, hospitality and retail sectors, to raise awareness for the ""If You See Something, Say Something"" campaign. In each sector, we have provided materials and collaborated on advertisements to help engage and educate the public as well as those working behind the scenes. The campaign has also forged a strong partnership with sports in every part of the country, including auto racing and college athletics. Starting this fall, fans will see the new PSA in stadiums nationwide, urging them to say something if they see something. This could be an unattended bag or package; a vehicle that seems out of place; suspicious behavior or activity, like a person entering a restricted area that should not be there or leaving an item under a seat or behind a trash can. Everyone has a role in keeping our communities safe. Reports from individual citizens have helped save lives and avert potential catastrophes. When we each do our part, we keep our nation safe, one hometown at a time.

"(CNN) -- As it measures its response to the recent events on Egypt, the U.S. needs to be extremely careful about focusing on the definition of ""coup"" and the legitimacy -- or non-legitimacy -- of Mohamed Morsy's election, the draft constitution, and the now-ousted Egyptian president's efforts to give himself additional powers. It needs to be equally careful about focusing on the protests that helped drive him from power, and the legitimacy of political Islam. If the U.S. focuses on whether or not a coup took place, it will be ignoring the fact that Egypt is a key center of the Middle East and that U.S. policy will be judged by its success in meeting the needs of Egypt's people. Egypt is a nation whose problems go far deeper than the crisis that began January 2011. As the Arab Human Development report made clear in 2009, former President Hosni Mubarak's rule had become steadily more ineffective, corrupt, and incapable of meeting the needs of Egypt's people long before 2011. He had been in power since October 1981, but the social and economic progress he made in his first decade in power had faded into a static, incompetent regime by 2005, and one that became steadily more corrupt and unable to meet the needs of Egypt's young and growing population. The last two years have made the situation far worse in ways that affect every aspect of day-to-day life. Mubarak's fall tore down a fragile regime that mixed a state-driven economy with crony capitalism. It was a country with a bureaucracy that could barely function without a strong leader, one with no opposition parties that had real political experience or capability to govern, and whose ""reformers"" were (and still are) protesters with no capability to make real reforms. Opinion: In Egypt, get ready for extremist backlash . The end result is that Egypt is not an abstract exercise in political theory. It is a nation of more than 85 million people, at least 25% of whom live in dire poverty, and where unemployment and underemployment can no longer be accurately estimated but have reached the crisis level. It is a nation with over 50% of its population under 25 years of age, and 31% under 14, but with an education system in breakdown and much of the infrastructure frozen or losing capacity. Egypt's foreign reserves have dropped by more than 50% and it faces a crisis in getting loans from the International Monetary Fund. It is a nation where foreign investment has critically declined, tourist revenue has dropped sharply, where many small businesses have already collapsed, and many middle class Egyptians have lost their jobs and savings. Fuel and electric power are lacking, food subsidies are uncertain and sometimes failing, the currency is increasingly unstable, and crime has skyrocketed. U.S. policy must focus on these realities, and not just politics. The U.S., in partnership with its allies, the World Bank and other international aid agencies institutions needs to support immediate Egyptian efforts to salvage the economy and bring economic reform. It needs to focus on bringing relief and stability. No Egyptian government can succeed -- democratic or not -- that cannot meet the needs of the Egyptian people. Real political legitimacy is not determined by how a government is chosen, but by how well it can meet the needs of its people. Opinion: Will Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood survive? As for politics, the U.S. needs to work with other states to push Egypt's military to support the reforms that failed between early 2011 and Morsy's fall. This means a broad-based effort to agree on a constitution, the creation of real political parties, and help for protesters learning how to organize politically and focus on practical governance and reform. It means taking enough time for elections to be open, to include Islamic and more secular parties, and focusing on the same kind of mixed national government and consensus politics that seem to have emerged in Tunisia. One test of a solution to a problem is that it does not make things even worse. Threatening Egypt's military, rigidly cutting off aid because of a ""coup"" under conditions where there is no credible replacement government, and standing aside as Egypt drifts towards internal collapse is not a strategy. Letting today's celebration of Morsy's fall turn into civil conflict and political paralysis will be a moral and ethical failure on the part of the Obama administration and the Congress, one that will do the Egyptian people vast harm, cripple a key ally, and leave a legacy of lasting anger in both Egypt and the region. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Anthony Cordesman.","Cordesman: U.S. must focus not on details of Morsy ouster but on Egypt's ongoing crisis .

"(CNN) -- Myanmar's courts convicted 22 Buddhists this week for sparking anti-Muslim violence and bloodshed in March, according to a state-run newspaper. At least 43 people died and thousands more were displaced as a result of violence in the city of Meiktila, in central Myanmar, with the Muslim population sustaining the bulk of the casualties. Those convicted this week received prison terms ranging from one to ten years in prison, including hard labor, the state-run New Light of Myanmar reported. Anti-Muslim sectarian attacks in Meiktila began March 20, reportedly after an argument between a Muslim gold shop owner and two Buddhist sellers. The wave of violence that swept the city included beatings, arson and immolations. Many Muslims claimed local police took no action to stop the riots. After three days, President Thein Sein declared a state of emergency, allowing the military to enter the city and restore order. Sein said the government did not intervene immediately in order to avoid endangering the country's ""ongoing democratic transition and reform efforts."" ""I would like to warn all political opportunists and religious extremists who try to exploit the noble teachings of these religions, and have tried to plant hatred among people of different faiths for their own self-interest: Their efforts will not be tolerated,"" he said. This week's convictions continue to highlight the fragility of ethnic relations in Myanmar, also known as Burma, as it emerges from decades of military repression. Authorities have released thousands of political prisoners and pursued peace talks with rebel groups in the past two years.","Myanmar convicts 22 Buddhists for anti-Muslim violence, bloodshed in March .

"(CareerBuilder.com) -- Have you ever looked at your boss and wondered ""Who promoted you?"" or ""How have you not been fired by now?"" If you have, take comfort in knowing you're not alone -- many of us have to deal with bosses that seem in over their heads. The fact is, that while your inept boss may drive you nuts, it may not even be his or her fault -- or even the fault of your company for promoting your boss in the first place. Your unsuspecting employer had no idea that your boss would become a full-blown case of the Peter Principle in action. So who is Peter and what did he do to make your boss so frustrating, you ask? Well, Laurence J. Peter is a former professor who published a satirical book based around his theory that ""In a hierarchy, every employee tends to rise to his level of incompetence"" and that ""In time, every post tends to be occupied by an employee who is incompetent to carry out its duties."" Or, basically: We do a job well, we're promoted. We do that job well, we're promoted again. This happens in succession until we eventually rise to a position that we can no longer do well -- or our level of incompetence. There, we either stagnate, revert back to a lower position, or are fired. While ""The Peter Principle: Why Things Always Go Wrong,"" was originally meant to provide a sort of absurd-yet-true comic relief to the over-worked, the practicality and pertinence of the Peter Principle was not lost on the working world, and the theory has since become a hotly debated human resources phenomenon. Below three experts argue their side of the Peter Principle. CareerBuilder.com: Conflicting career advice: Which is right . ""It's true!"" -- Ric Morgan, professional speaker and author of ""The Keys: The Textbook to a Successful Life"" ""I live in a city where one of the department heads (and the highest paid civic employee in the city) is the most incompetent person you'd ever want to meet. Ever since he [took the job] it has been one disaster after another. He'll hire someone to do a job for the city, and when they too prove to be incompetent, he hires someone else to cover his tracks saying that the last company wasn't a good fit. This incompetence has cost the city millions of dollars, and yet he has the council members, the Mayor and city manager bamboozled, so they don't fire him. [As a business consultant], the minute I find the people who are living examples of the Peter Principle is the minute I find the problems in the company. This problem is so diverse and prevalent I have even seen examples of the founder of the company being a leading example of the Peter Principle. I know that sounds crazy, but they had two things going for them: an idea that was just too good to fail, and the ability to hire very competent people to make it all work. I have even, as crazy as this sounds, found people who are running or trying to start one-man shops. In this day and age of entrepreneurship, everyone believes they can start a business and make it succeed because they 'have the best idea that will make them overnight millionaires.' Wrong! It's hard to look into someone's eyes and tell them they are too incompetent to do what they have set out to do, even if they have been doing something similar in another place, where they had actually reached the level of incompetence espoused by Laurence. A lot people believe the Peter Principle applies to just business, but there are an awful lot of people out there who live it in all areas of their life. They are incompetent at life itself. We have all met people like this and we always wonder how they even exist."" CareerBuilder.com: How to self-promote without being obnoxious . ""It's false!"" -- Leigh Steere, co-owner, Managing People Better, LLC . ""I personally do not believe in the Peter Principle. The field of neurolinguistic programming says that any behavior/skill can be learned. In other words, if a person does not already know how to do something, he/she can be taught. Sometimes, however, we have internal barriers to learning and achievement that keep us from growing intellectually and professionally. Limiting beliefs, such as 'I'm not smart enough' or 'I'm not good at math,' can keep people from attempting more complex challenges. This is not an issue of incompetence. It is an issue of limiting beliefs -- or an 'emotional intelligence' gap. Stagnation, reverting to a lower position or being fired can result from a variety of 'emotional intelligence' gaps. For example, some people have not adequately learned to read body language cues. They may press their point, even though it is clear listeners are becoming angry or defensive. They may bark orders at colleagues, unaware that listeners are bristling. They don't adjust their communication to preserve rapport. One might argue that this is a form of incompetence. However, the Peter Principle seems to suggest that each person has a level of competence that he/she cannot move beyond. I strongly disagree with this presupposition. Even the most bull-in-a-china-shop communicator can learn techniques for building rapport, resolving conflict gracefully, etc. The issue is: is a person able to acknowledge their deficits and seek help. In some cases, employees are in such denial that they do remain stuck or they get fired ... until they finally 'get' the message. There is an older book, 'Battling the Inner Dummy,' that offers an interesting concept -- 'controlled trauma to induce transformation' and offers this illustration: 'Boot camp ... can be thought of as an example of controlled trauma that is designed to foster traits like loyalty and obedience.' Sometimes, an employer can stage a controlled trauma to help an employee move beyond a stuck place or overcome denial. For example, let's say a star salesperson is running roughshod over co-workers by communicating curtly, expecting them to stay until midnight to finish tasks that could wait until the next day, etc. An employer could pull the person aside and say, 'We appreciate your sales talent and all the business you have brought to our company. However, we are receiving numerous complaints from your colleagues about your communication style. We value you and want you to continue here. But this bullying communication style cannot continue. We will pay for a coach to work with you on this if you would like to stay with our company. Otherwise, you will need to find employment elsewhere.' If the salesperson accepts the coaching, he/she has an opportunity to move to a new level in his/her career. In contrast, the Peter Principle suggests this salesperson would hit a career ceiling.""

I don't believe you can really measure the truth of the Peter Principle without analyzing the training the person has had for the position they have moved into, especially if it's a promotion. With each promotion the person has to give up some of the things they have done before and take on new tasks, responsibilities and perspectives (including work values). What they did before will not ensure their success in the present.

"(Mental Floss) -- David Letterman has been in the news for helping police foil an alleged attempt to blackmail him, but the late-night star is hardly the first celebrity in this position. Celebrities ranging from Cameron Diaz to Elvis Presley have been victims in past extortion schemes . Here are a few brazen and mostly unsuccessful attempts to blackmail famous people. 1. Bill Cosby  Bill Cosby may be one of television's most famous family men, but a 1997 extortion attempt tried to claim that his family was a bit bigger than anyone knew. That year, a 23-year-old woman named Autumn Jackson attempted to extort $40 million from Cosby in exchange for not telling the press she was the star's illegitimate daughter. While Cosby admitted that he had an affair with Jackson's mother and had given the woman and her daughter over $100,000 in support over the years, he flatly denied being Jackson's father. Jackson's timing probably didn't help, either; Cosby received her demand the same day Cosby's son, Ennis, was murdered. Jackson, who was convicted along with two accomplices, received a 26-month prison sentence. An appeals court briefly overturned the sentence in 1999, but quickly reversed itself and sent her back to the clink. Mental Floss: 5 ""Cosby Show"" mysteries . 2. Louie Anderson  The hefty comic became a target for blackmail after allegedly propositioning a man in a Las Vegas casino in 1993. At the time, Anderson was hosting ""Family Feud"" and starring in the cartoon ""Life With Louie."" Rather than take a hit to his public image, Anderson shelled out $100,000 in hush money to his blackmailer, Richard John Gordon, to keep the story out of the tabloids. Gordon got greedy in 2000, though. He came back to Anderson for another $250,000, at which point the comedian went to the cops. Gordon ended up being arrested following a high-speed chase from the LAPD, and he eventually went to prison for the extortion attempt. 3. Cameron Diaz  A note to any aspiring actresses out there: if you're planning on becoming famous, don't pose for any nude photographs. Just ask Cameron Diaz. In 1992, the young model let photographer John Rutter take nude and bondage-themed snaps of her in the hopes of making an entry into the artistic modeling market. Instead, Rutter sat on the photos until Diaz's 2003 film ""Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle"" was about to debut, at which point he made Diaz an offer: she could buy the pictures for $3.5 million, or he would sell them to magazines. Rutter claimed he had a signed release form from Diaz that allowed him to sell the pictures if he so chose. Rather than give in, though, Diaz alerted the authorities. It turned out that Diaz's ""signature"" was a forgery, and Rutter was found guilty of attempted grand theft, forgery, and perjury. Although Rutter claimed that he was simply offering Diaz the right of first refusal for the salacious pics, he ended up getting a three-year jail sentence.  Mental Floss: 11 pictures politicians regret . 4. Elvis Presley  J. Edgar Hoover's FBI kept meticulous files on a lot of high-profile entertainers, including the King. When Elvis' file found its way to the public, it revealed a number of blackmail attempts, including one particularly large case from when Elvis was serving in the Army. When Elvis was stationed in Germany in 1959, he hired South African doctor Laurenz Johannes Griessel-Landau to carry out a series of skin treatments on his famous face and shoulders. After a month, Elvis and his entourage allegedly grew tired of Griessel-Landau constantly making passes at them, so Elvis fired the dermatologist. This angered the doctor, who then threatened to reveal compromising photographs and tapes of the rock star if Elvis didn't open his wallet, according to FBI files. Elvis held firm, though, and only gave Griessel-Landau $200 for the skin treatments and a $315 plane ticket back to London. The files also state that when Griessel-Landau came back for thousands of dollars more, Elvis refused, and the blackmailer -- who it turned out wasn't actually a doctor after all -- eventually left the King alone.

"(CNN) -- A New Jersey law enforcement officer is charged with murder after police say he shot a man in an apparent road rage incident in Maryland, according to authorities. Joseph Walker, a sworn officer of the Hudson County prosecutor's office, is accused of fatally shooting a motorist Saturday during an altercation off of Maryland's Route 3. The preliminary investigation suggests that two vehicles came to a stop on an exit ramp after a previous altercation. One of the drivers, Joseph Harvey Jr., and a passenger then exited their vehicle and walked toward Walker's, according to a news release from Maryland State Police. Walker, 40, allegedly fired a .45 caliber Glock at Harvey and struck him. Harvey, 36, died of his wounds Saturday night at Baltimore Washington Medical Center. Elena Russo, spokeswoman for the Maryland State Police, told CNN affiliate WJZ that Walker's wife and three children were in his vehicle at the time of the shooting. Hudson County prosecutor's office spokesman Gene Rubino says his office is aware of the fatal shooting involving one of its detectives, who was off-duty and traveling in Maryland with his wife and children. Rubino refused to comment further. It is unclear whether Walker has an attorney. Walker is facing second-degree murder and manslaughter charges. He is being held on a $1 million bond, Maryland State Police said.","Joseph Walker, a New Jersey detective, is charged with second-degree murder .

"For 17-year-old Madeleine, sunset brings fear. ""People prowl around the camp at night,"" she says, sitting on her straw bed in the makeshift camp she is forced to call ""home."" Refugees have been fleeing fighting between renegade militia groups in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo. ""When I'm alone in my shelter at night, people come by and pull up the blanket over the door. They look at me, and won't answer when I ask who they are. I'm completely scared."" Just four weeks ago, Madeleine was forced to flee her village in the east of the Democratic Republic of Congo, walking 24 hours to get to Bulengo camp, on the outskirts of Goma town. She had been raped by two rebel militia men who attacked her while she was working in the fields. ""Each one took me,"" she says. ""I stayed for one week at home, bleeding. I couldn't walk. Then my father threw me out because he thought I was pregnant and carrying an enemy child."" Madeleine's story is run of the mill here. The pain she feels does not mark her. For the past two months a steady stream of adults and children has been arriving here, trying to escape the vicious fighting between renegade militia groups that seems, once again, to be engulfing parts of eastern Democratic Republic of Congo. Around 40,000 are now crowded into Bulengo. Another 136,000 have fled to other camps around Goma and into Uganda, and the numbers are continuing to rise. The all-too-familiar cycles of destruction, rape and violence that have plagued this vast country for the past ten years, leaving more than four million dead, seem to have returned. In September last year, to much fanfare, the country held its first democratic elections. Observers hoped that for the first time, Congo's history of bad government and rebellious factions could be put to rest. But for those living in the still-lawless east, there has been no such relief. ""Many of us have never re-found life,"" says Benjamin Mafuluko Mugaliya, the secretary of Mugunga 2 camp, five minutes drive from Bulengo. ""People are suffering terribly. The soldiers come and burn our houses, separate families and kill. It is getting worse and it is very frightening"" He stands behind a battered table - there are no chairs - in a small hut he uses as the camp's headquarters. ""It's not safe for us here. We've had cases of cholera, dysentery, and there's no medical centre. The facilities here are terrible. This camp has been here for five months and it was only last week that we got a water pump."" Even basic shelter is still a problem for the 16,000 living here. ""Two-thirds of the families still don't have plastic sheeting to protect them from the cold and the rain,"" says Mugaliya. ""And there aren't enough clothes. We try to protect the children, but it's difficult, especially when they're going out into the village to try to earn money. They are being exploited inside and outside the camp. It's very frustrating not to be able to act."" A straw pole among the kids at the water pump affirms Mugaliya worries. ""Look at me, I'm dirty,"" confides eight-year old Vivian, a square-shouldered little boy wearing a filthy grey t-shirt. ""We get wet when it rains,"" adds 12-year-old Chantale, who lives, as do most in the camp, under a cramped shelter made of branches and banana leaves. ""And we're just hungry. We have to start our life every day without eating or drinking."" The biggest complaint, however, is boredom. ""We don't do anything,"" says nine-year-old Paul, chewing a piece of plastic. ""We want to go to school, we want school desks and books and uniforms. But there is nothing for us."" Angelique Myirasafari is a social worker with aid organisation Save the Children, which is working with children in the camps around Goma. ""We help look after children who have been separated from their families, listening to their stories, helping them to get medical care, trying to trace their parents,"" she says. ""Sometimes you can't believe the stories you are hearing. These children have gone through so much. Many of the children we are working with have been forced to fight as soldiers, both boys and girls. They are captured in their villages by militia, tied up and sent to kill on the front line."" She breaks off to talk to a teenage boy who has arrived at the tent door, clearly ill, his face running with sweat. When she returns, she continues. ""After more than ten years of fighting it feels like the country is on the brink again, and it can't be allowed to happen. The international community has a responsibility here, to make sure all the military leaders come together to find a peaceable solution."" She waves her arm towards the door. ""These kids are desperate to be at home with their families, going to school, and to be responsible for their own lives. They tell me they want to be pilots, doctors, even drivers with big cars.

"New Delhi (CNN) -- India's scandal-tainted government has come under fresh attack from opposition parties after a leading newspaper ran a front-page report alleging that auditors had found that the awarding of coal fields to private companies had deprived the treasury of $211 billion. As lawmakers from across the spectrum of opposition parties criticized Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's administration over the Times of India story on Thursday, his office issued excerpts of a letter to him from the federal auditor that described the news report as ""exceedingly misleading."" One of the country's most respected dailies, the Times of India cited what it said were the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG)'s draft estimates from the awarding of 155 coal blocks to some 100 firms without auction between 2004 and 2009. The newspaper said the government had allocated areas for coal production to commercial operators without putting them up for competitive auction. According to the CAG's calculations, the newspaper said, the authorities sold the rights to the mining areas for much less than they were worth, passing on ""undue benefits"" to the companies. The report claimed the loss to the government was six times the size of the amount lost by the allotment of telecommunications frequencies in 2008 at below market value. The telecommunications scandal, the result of a CAG report, put tremendous pressure on Singh's government, leading to the resignations of top officials and fueling a powerful grassroots protest movement against corruption. But the national auditor said the report on the coal blocks misrepresented its findings. ""The details being brought out were observations which are under discussion at a very preliminary stage and do not even constitute our pre-final draft and hence are exceedingly misleading,"" read a portion of the CAG's letter made public by the prime minister's office. ""The leak of the initial draft causes great embarrassment as the audit report is still under preparation. Such leakage causes very deep anguish,"" it read. The letter came after opposition leaders sought a discussion in parliament over what they claimed to be a huge scandal. ""This is the worst scam,"" said Prakash Javadekar, spokesman for the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party. ""This government has lost, forfeited its right to continue in power,"" he said. Left-wing politicians were equally scathing in their reaction. ""It is a serious scam, a very big scam. In fact, all these scams are taking place because of the wrong policies pursued by the government, favoring all corporate houses, big business houses in the country,"" said D. Raja, a leader in the Communist Party of India. He asked why the government had not awarded the coalfields through an auction process. A lawmaker from the Communist Party of India (Marxist), Sitaram Yechury, called for a wide-ranging investigation. Before releasing the letter from the CAG, the government issued cautious comments on the matter. ""I cannot comment on the basis of newspaper reports, until I have the actual report (of the CAG),"" said Coal Minister Sri Prakash Jaiswal. He insisted that no coal blocks had been granted during the second term of Singh's government, which began in 2009. ""If the CAG has raised any objections over any such allocations before that, we will be able to make a comment only after studying them,"" Jaiswal said. Singh's government has been hit by a series of corruption allegations, including a damning 2010 CAG report about the underselling of the cell phone permits. It put the cost to the government coffers of that affair at around $31 billion dollars in lost revenues. The telecommunications licenses issued under the sale have since been revoked by the Supreme Court. A number of politicians, bureaucrats and company executives are facing trial after the telecommunications scandal shook the government. All the defendants have denied any wrongdoing. Singh's Congress Party, headed by Italian born Sonia Gandhi, paid a political price this month when it suffered a heavy defeat in a key regional vote. Seen as a litmus test for the popularity of the national coalition, the recent elections in India's most populous state, Uttar Pradesh, gave a decisive majority to a provincial grouping. That was despite a rigorous campaign by the Congress Party to try to revive its fortunes in the region.","An audit found billions in lost revenue from coal field allocations, says Indian paper .

"(CNN) -- The New Orleans Saints admitted Tuesday to paying bonuses for hits that would knock opposing players out of a game, vowing the practice won't be repeated. Saints Head Coach Sean Payton and General Manager Mickey Loomis said they take ""full responsibility"" for the practice, which they said ""happened under our watch."" ""These are serious violations, and we understand the negative impact it has had on our game,"" Loomis and Payton said in a statement issued Tuesday evening. ""Both of us have made it clear within our organization that this will never happen again, and make that same promise to the NFL and most importantly to all of our fans."" Opinion: 'Bounty' system stemmed from fans' lust for violence . The National Football League reported Friday that the Saints paid defensive players a bounty for injuring opponents, as well as making interceptions and fumble recoveries, during the 2009-2011 seasons. The program involved as many as 27 players and at least one assistant coach, the league concluded. The league said the program was administered by then-defensive coordinator Gregg Williams, with knowledge of other coaches. Players regularly contributed cash to a pool, which may have topped $50,000 at its peak. The players were paid $1,500 for a ""knockout,"" when an opposing player was not able to return to the game, and $1,000 for a ""cart-off,"" when an opposing player had to be carried off the field. In some cases, particular players on the opposing team were targeted, the NFL said. NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell has received the results of the investigation and will decide on discipline, which could include fines, suspensions and forfeiture of draft choices. Saints owner Tom Benson said Monday the team cooperated with investigation and called the findings ""troubling."" In their statement, Payton and Loomis said they were sorry for the ""undue hardship"" the violations had caused Benson, ""who had nothing to do with this activity."" In a statement released Friday, Williams called the bounties ""a terrible mistake"" that he knew was wrong. ""Instead of getting caught up in it, I should have stopped it,"" Williams, now a defensive coordinator for the St. Louis Rams, said in a statement quoted by the New Orleans Times-Picayune newspaper. ""I take full responsibility for my role. I am truly sorry. I have learned a hard lesson, and I guarantee that I will never participate in or allow this kind of activity to happen again."" The disclosure has ignited controversy among football fans nationwide -- and Tuesday, former NBA star Charles Barkley said he had taken part in a bounty program during his basketball playing days in the 1980s. Barkley, now a commentator for CNN sister network TNT, said in an online interview that he had called on teammates to knock out an opposing player whose team was beating Barkley's Philadelphia 76ers by a 30-point margin. He put the bounty amount at $5,000 but would not identify the player or opposing team. ""We were getting beat by 30 or 40, I can't remember,"" he told interviewer Dan Patrick. ""This guy was shooting threes and running up and down the court. I said, 'Hey, we've got to hurt that guy right there.' "" Barkley added that ""people are clearly going to overreact to the bounty thing,"" which he said should have stayed among the players. CNN's Joe Sutton contributed to this report.","NEW: Saints leaders apologize to the team's owner for ""undue hardship""

"On CNN's ""State of the Union,"" host and chief national correspondent John King goes outside the Beltway to report on the issues affecting communities across the country. This week, King traveled to Georgia to learn about the toll military service is taking on two veterans. Chris Tucker, who served three tours in Iraq, suffers from hearing, back, foot problems and still has nightmares. SAVANNAH, Georgia (CNN) -- As his tank rolled into Baghdad in April 2003, Chris Tucker mounted his camera to capture the moment. ""It's history; we made history,"" he told CNN back then. ""It's my first war, hopefully my last war."" He could not have imagined then that six years later, Iraq would still be a combat zone. ""I thought we would get there quick and handle our business and we'd be out,"" Tucker told us this week. ""At least, that's what we were told anyway."" Tucker received a medical discharge from the Army last year and he now is Officer Chris Tucker of the Savannah-Chatham Metropolitan Police Department. ""You still get to serve your community and your country in other ways,"" he said. At age 26, he is a veteran of three combat tours. The patrol skills he learned on the streets of Baghdad, Fallujah and Sadr City come in handy as he drives his police cruiser around the neighborhoods of his Savannah precinct. ""Some people -- you will be moving around the corner and they will just run,"" Tucker said as he drove his cruiser. ""And you can tell they are favoring one side -- maybe they have a gun."" He loves his new job, and the joys of fatherhood. His daughter Callie was born three months ago. ""So my life is slowing down,"" Tucker said. ""But I enjoy the slow pace."" But he hasn't left it all behind. As the war hits the six-year mark, Tucker is part of a history -- and a legacy -- still being written as the military tries to better understand the depth of the damage to those exposed repeatedly to the violence. ""I still have the nightmares and wake up and find myself downstairs and I don't know how I got there,"" Tucker said. ""I still see and dream the same things. ... Faces. Kids' faces. People that you have engaged or you have had contact with. ... You see your colleagues blown up. Things like that."" He left the Army with a sour taste. He was sent back for his third tour despite the nightmares, depression, major hearing loss and painful injuries to his back and both feet. Then, the Army decided to give him a medical discharge for his back issues even though Tucker believes he could have recovered with rehabilitation. But he tries not to dwell on his frustration. ""I try to distance myself from it as much as I can, because for me, the more I think about it, the more I reflect on what happened and what we did, the more I think the dreams and the nightmares actually come back."" Tucker is as tired of the Iraq war as anyone, but his experience tells him things can suddenly take a turn for the worse, and so he is skeptical of President Obama's promise to get most combat troops out of Iraq by August 2010. ""I think we are in too deep to pull out,"" Tucker said. ""You can't just commit the way we committed and then say, 'OK, we are done.' ... Politics should not be involved in the way the war is handled."" There will be no more tours for Tucker, but a colleague on the Savannah-Chatham force will soon deploy for his first Iraq tour, and is being ribbed around the precinct, by Tucker and others, as ""the grandpa going off to war."" Police Cpl. Randy Powell is 50 years old and became a grandfather just last week.  Watch Tucker and Powell tell their stories » . Powell served nearly 20 years ago in the Persian Gulf War, then in 1992 took an early retirement package when the Army was downsizing after the war. The deal required him to stay on what the military calls the IRR -- the Individual Ready Reserve -- but even as troops were sent to Afghanistan after 9/11 and then to Iraq for repeat combat tours, Powell heard nothing. Then last year, nearly 15 years after leaving the military, he was told to report to a local Reserve center. Another request came in January of this year. Both times, after some perfunctory paperwork, Powell was sent home. But when he returned home from work one day last month, an overnight letter from the Army had arrived with orders that he was being activated for an Iraq deployment. First, starting next month, he'll have refresher training on radar systems at Fort Jackson in South Carolina. ""They're kind of shocked,"" Powell said of his family. But there are no complaints from Powell -- to the contrary. ""I still feel I am fully capable of being a soldier,"" he told us outside at his police precinct. ""Once a soldier, always a soldier. I find that it's an honor to serve within the military. I enjoyed the military while I was in. Kind of looking forward to getting back in the groove.""","Savannah police officer lives with physical, mental injuries from Iraq war .

"(CNN) -- The grandson of civil rights activist Malcolm X, Malcolm Shabazz, died in a Mexico City hospital after suffering an apparent beating, police told CNN. Prosecutors are investigating the death as a homicide, police spokesman Octavio Campos said. Police were called to the scene of an injured man at 3:30 a.m. Thursday one block south of Plaza Garibaldi, a rough but famous patch of Mexico City known for its mariachis. Shabazz appeared to have been beaten, but had no wounds from other weapons, Campos said. The 29-year-old was transported to Mexico City's Balbuena General Hospital, where he died later Thursday morning because of his injuries, he said. The prosecutor's office said in a statement that Shabazz had been at ""a place of recreation"" and had been drinking beers that night. ""To all who knew him, he offered kindness, encouragement and hope for a better tomorrow,"" the Shabazz family said in a statement Friday. ""Although his bright light and boundless potential are gone from this life, we are grateful that he now rests in peace in the arms of his grandparents and the safety of God."" A U.S. State Department spokeswoman was aware that a U.S. citizen had died in Mexico, but declined to comment further. ""I was saddened, stunned, shocked, to read about the murder of young Malcolm,"" former Georgia congresswoman Cynthia McKinney said. The former lawmaker had taken Shabazz under her wing and he had traveled with her to Libya on a trip. ""Many of my closest associates have personal memories of their time with him and of his efforts to reach out to them for help,"" McKinney said. ""He was writing a book.""

"(CNN) -- Aliens have taken over London and the invasion is gathering pace. First it was YouTube clips, then appearances with the mayor. Now they're on the shelves of every corner shop and immortalized in statues across the city. Or at least that's how visitors to the Olympics might imagine the futuristic, one-eyed creatures plastered on everything from key rings to double-decker buses. They are of course London 2012's Olympic and Paralympic mascots -- Wenlock and Mandeville. And with the Games just days away you'd better get used to seeing a whole lot more of that giant eyeball. With their metallic bodies, built-in cameras and sci-fi genetics, it's an ambitious design aimed at the digital age. But does it work? Are these otherworldly creatures the cutting edge of design or just plain creepy? Described as everything from ""a drunken one-night stand between a Teletubby and a Dalek,"" to having ""just the right balance of digital zeitgeist and cheeky playfulness,"" it seems people still aren't quite sure what to make of London 2012's mascots. Cute and cuddly they ain't . Waldi the Daschund set the standard for cute and cuddly animals as the first mascot at the 1972 Munich Games. Likewise Moscow opted for the adorable, if unimaginative, Mishka the Bear in 1980. The Olympic mascot has always been aimed at children -- and the wallets of their parents. But it's also an embodiment of the host city's personality and a lasting legacy of its Games. Driving all of this is a massive merchandise operation. Sure, Wenlock and Mandeville need to look good -- but they also need to sell. LOCOG are hoping to make £80 million ($124 million) from merchandise sales alone. ""I think they started as a pretty ambitious pair with real potential to be used across a new medium -- social media. But I don't think they've pulled it off completely,"" Mark Sinclair, deputy editor of London design magazine, Creative Review, told CNN. ""I don't think people have been able to warm to them because they're kind of severe looking with this massive eye. Maybe that's what's alienated people because they can't quite get a handle on what they are. ""They're missing a little bit of soul."" 4 billions reasons to watch the Olympics . Right. So what are they? But maybe that's just the response from an ""older, stuffier generation,"" as Wenlock and Mandeville co-designer Grant Hunter told CNN. The pair were designed by marketing agency Iris and named after the Shropshire town of Much Wenlock, which helped inspire Pierre de Coubertin to launch the modern Olympics, and the Buckinghamshire village of Stoke Mandeville, where the Paralympics were founded. Supposedly created out of magical droplets of steel left over from the Olympic Stadium, every element of their design is laden with symbolism. The taxi lights on their heads refer to London's black cabs and their origins from a steel melting pot are likened to multicultural Britain. Their distinctive giant eyes even have built-in cameras to record their experiences. Though in a country with one of the highest number of CCTV cameras in the world, this particular symbolism may be a little too close to home. The children's mascot . But perhaps the most important critic is the children they were created for. ""The brief stated, 'Inspire young people to get involved with sport.' We judge the success by the response of young people to our creations,"" Hunter said. ""If you look at sites like the BBC's CBBC you'll see the overwhelming positive feedback that Wenlock and Mandeville have received. When you have eight-year-olds saying how cool they look and they want them to visit their school, we know we've done our job."" Mechanical objects are no less endearing than wide-eyed animals, Hunter argues, pointing to the success of Disney's Wall-E. As nine-year-old Sunil said on the CBBC website: ""I think the mascots are really cool because they look like amazing robots."" 10 strangest Olympic sports . Sinister spoofs . Some adults aren't so convinced. When Wenlock figurines dressed in police uniforms appeared on Amazon, quick-witted reviewers saw it as an opportunity to deride the ""creepy"" toy. ""I bought this product amidst my keenness for the Games of the XXX Olympiad,"" one reviewer posted. ""However when it arrived it knocked down the door in a raid, pinned me down and falsely arrested me for conspiring a bomb plot for mass murder during this summer's sporting events."" With the army being called in to help boost security amid the G4S crisis, and residents complaining about anti-terror missiles on their rooftops, there's already been a huge focus on London's perceived heavy-handedness in the buildup to the Games. It's an unfortunate context for Wenlock and Mandeville, as Sinclair jokes: ""Seeing that eye you're reminded you're on your best behavior, looking over your shoulder to make sure you're not wearing a Nike t-shirt in the venue."" Twitter Olympics . Regardless of your opinion on their design, there's no denying Wenlock and Mandeville's impressive social media credentials. As momentum builds around the first ""Twitter Olympics,"" London's mascots are well equipped with their own Twitter accounts, Facebook pages, YouTube clips and interactive website. ""We felt that previous mascots had been one-dimensional and had followed a predictable path. We knew that to connect with young people we had to create characters designed for the digital age,"" Hunter said. How history remembers them is yet to be seen.

"(LifeWire) -- Older woman seduces younger man. Sound familiar? It's a scene from the 1967 coming-of-age classic ""The Graduate."" Actress Demi Moore is 15 years older than her husband, actor Ashton Kutcher. But high-profile Hollywood couples like Susan Sarandon and Tim Robbins (12 years her junior) -- who met and began dating while filming an on-screen romance in the 1988 movie ""Bull Durham"" -- have proven that life can indeed imitate art when it comes to matters of the heart. Theirs, however, is a real-life love story of an older woman and younger man -- something that is not so uncommon nowadays. A 2003 study by AARP revealed that 34 percent of all women over 40 in the survey were dating younger men, and 35 percent preferred it to dating older men. ""Societal attitudes have definitely changed,"" says Susan Winter, 52, co-author of ""Older Women, Younger Men: New Options for Love and Romance"" -- and she would know. At age 40, she was dating a 19-year-old. ""We had to break it off. Quite frankly, his mother made it so impossible,"" Winter says of the six-year relationship, which inspired her book. ""But (that kind of discrimination) would not be allowable now."" Hollywood in particular has defied the ageism stereotype, with celebrities like Madonna and Demi Moore marrying significantly younger men (a 10- and 15-year age gap, respectively, with director Guy Ritchie and actor Ashton Kutcher), and the public has come to accept it.  See photos of some famous May-December couples » . Moreover, says Winter, women have experienced a significant financial and status shift over the past half-century. ""When women as a group are able to have their own economic and social standing and have a power base, they are now able to pick the man that they want rather than having to choose the man to support them and give them social status,"" Winter explains. ""Now we have choices."" But these relationships aren't always portrayed in a positive light. Terms like ""cougar"" (slang for an older woman seeking a younger man) depict the woman as a predator, rather than an empowered, independent and loving person. NBC aired a reality dating show this summer -- ""Age of Love"" -- that pitted women in their 20s against women in their 40s in a battle for the heart of tennis star Mark Philippoussis. Meanwhile, online dating sites like GoCougar.com urge older women who seek younger men to ""get what you want."" Such pairings can and do work. Mary Pender, 37, a high school special education teacher in Huntington Beach, California, connected with a truck driver seven years her junior who she met on an online dating site. Though she'd always dated older men before, she ""thought it was exciting to date someone younger""  -- and, as it turned out, he thought it'd be just as exciting a match. ""He thinks it's cool that I am comfortable in my sexuality,"" says Pender. ""He likes that I am secure in our relationship and I have my own things to do without him."" Indeed, the idea of dating an older woman is titillating for some younger guys. Jeremy Abelson, a self-styled dating impresario who organized the Natural Selection Speed Date event that paired wealthy bachelors with beautiful women this past February in New York City, can see the appeal. ""Any young guy who has seen (the movie) 'American Pie' can basically say he was right there with the Asian guy and the white guy as they were cheering ... for Stifler's mom,"" says Abelson, 27. ""I was basically standing there cheering with them. And I think that's a very common fantasy for young men."" The potential issues between such May-December couples are the same ones that challenge the longevity of any relationship: different long-term priorities and emotional temperament. ""He's not thinking about kids and marriage,"" says Pender of her boyfriend, ""and he bugs me when I forget to dye my gray roots."" If you can work through these issues, the adage holds true: Age ain't nothing but a number. ""When I finally found out how much younger he was, I was a little shocked,"" says Kimberly Schmitz, a 34-year-old communications and public relations director in Tucson, Arizona, of her now-fiancé, Bobby Kern, 25, owner of a feed store and pet food distribution company in the same city. ""(But) he is such an amazing man that I decided to let his actions speak more than his statistics. I was right. He is the most mature and sensitive man I have ever dated."" For Kern, the attraction is mutual. ""There was no fear in dating an older woman,"" he says. ""I prefer to date older women, and for some reason I always have, even in high school. It seems that they are easier to get along with -- there is, for the most part, no drama. Older women know what they want, they usually are in a career, are financially secure and not looking for a man to take care of them."" E-mail to a friend .

"(CNN) -- Before I applied for the CNN Fit Nation program, I thought I knew quite a bit about the sport of triathlon. I had volunteered at a few races, helping athletes navigate the courses, and I even witnessed newly crowned world champions crossing the finish line. But what I knew, or thought I knew, was from the perspective of an outsider and very superficial. I really had no idea about the training that these athletes had gone through to prepare for their races. As with most things in life, seeing and doing are two very different things. I've already written about my struggles with running, so you know that worried me from the beginning. But I've changed as an athlete. The aches and pains are mostly gone now, and as long as I beat the heat and fuel my body, my running workouts are amazing. I've learned to listen to my body throughout the day -- especially during and after a workout -- and my successes have surprised me. Follow the CNN ""6-Pack"" with this interactive . Information is a powerful thing, and what I've learned from my coaches and what I've learned about myself has turned even me into a runner. I think many of my past problems resulted from trying to go too fast, too soon. In the past, when I started to see success, I wanted more, and that usually led to injury derailing my progress. I've learned how to build my base endurance slowly and teach my body how to train with a slow and steady progression. I've learned that you should never increase your distance more than 10% per week so that your body has time to adjust to the increased workload. I've been cycling for a few years, and I thought that would be my strongest discipline. However, I learned more about cycling at our May training camp in Florida than I thought possible. I learned the basics of riding in a ""paceline"" with my teammates and coaches, how to better control my bike and about the importance of keeping the pedals turning even when coasting (the ""soft pedal""). Who knew that central Florida was such a hilly place? I learned quickly. After climbing some of those never-ending hills, I'm a better climber and a better cyclist. Behind the scenes: Training for a triathlon . And that leads me to the pool. Swimming has become my nemesis -- and my biggest area of opportunity. Before starting this journey, I thought I could swim. I was wrong! My first attempts at swimming in a lap pool looked like I was ""fighting the water,"" to paraphrase my coach. It's much harder to swim when you're trying to keep your head out of the water the entire time. The freestyle stroke, the breathing and everything else about swimming was completely foreign to me. As with the other disciplines, I've learned to swim with the guidance of my coach and through lots of trial and error. Constantly practicing the exhale under water while only putting my face in the water or ""bobbing"" at the deep end of the pool has taught me how to control my breathing better. For me, the key to swimming was learning to relax. Now that I can better control my breathing, my workouts have finally become aerobic activities. To make my personal journey even more exciting, my girlfriend and a few of my closest friends have committed to taking a similar journey with me. They have started training and will be there in Malibu, California, not just cheering me on but racing their first triathlons as well. Now I'm able to share what I've learned with those closest to me. I often pass on simple tips, such as ""slow down and focus on your form."" There's no hurry when you're training; I've learned that once my form is good, I'm much more efficient when I pick up the pace. 10 ways to act like a champion . When I look back at the guy who first submitted an iReport to CNN, I thought I knew a bit about triathlons. But really I had no idea. The training once foreign to me is now a major part of my daily life, and I'm excited to say it's become a part of the lives of many people around me as well. I've grown as an athlete and as a person, and I'm learning how to train my mind as well as my body. When I cross the finish line in Malibu, I'll cross with my teammates, my family and my friends. We will have all shared a similar journey, and we will all become triathletes together.

"(CNN) -- During a recent visit to Mexico, a woman on a bus in Cancun expressed puzzlement to me about why anyone would choose to travel to her country right now. After a lengthy description of the violence in her hometown of Veracruz, she left me with emphatic advice: ""No confia en nadie,"" meaning ""trust no one."" That advice seems extreme. With a well-developed tourism sector, there are legions of people whose livelihood depends on helping you have a good time, and beyond that, most locals are warm and friendly. The drug violence that grabs most of the headlines shouldn't define a country so rich in world-class attractions. Yet safety should always be taken into account. The U.S. State Department warns against travel to many Mexican states, mostly in the north and west. Though southern Mexico goes about business as usual (and the State Department does not warn against travel to the area), it's important to exercise caution and remember that danger can arise anywhere. I've visited Mexico three times and have got a lot more to see, but here are three undeniably good reasons I've discovered to visit Mexico: . Gastronomia: Fried grasshoppers, perhaps? Mexican food as a category needs little introduction; it was even recognized by UNESCO as part of world heritage in 2010. But regional specialties abound. Oaxaca in southwestern Mexico is famous for multiple moles, complex stewed sauces served over meats. The Oaxacan treatment of the tortilla is the tlayuda, an open, crispy tortilla slathered with a bean paste, topped with cheese, meat or other toppings. More adventurous Oaxacan offerings are the famous chapulines, grasshoppers fried to a crunch and spiced with chile and lime. They are better than they might sound (unless you're wise enough to realize that anything crunchy with chile and lime is going to be good). Chocolate originated in Mexico, and they still make it best. Oaxaca is ground zero for chocoholics, where chocolate shops show visitors the transformation from beans into bars in the store. Chocolate here is most popular as a hot drink with water served alongside a sweet roll, but you can get it with milk or in bar form. Coastal cities such as Campeche or Cancun on the Gulf of Mexico have great seafood, notably ceviche. Mexican ceviche usually adds tomato to the citrus marinated fish and shrimp. Also often added is ketchup, though this usually is called coctel instead of ceviche. (The tomatoes are acceptable, the ketchup is an abomination). The Yucatan has specialties ranging from cochinita pibil (citrus marinated roast pork) to pavo en salsa negra (turkey in black salsa, a seriously funky dish made with burned chilies). You can get a pretty mean taco almost anywhere. Mexican tacos are usually soft corn tortillas, a small pile of meat and little pickled vegetable or onion. Salsa is around, but you have to add it yourself if you want it. The ends of many worlds . Mexico's many pre-Hispanic sites are among the country's most interesting destinations. They carried extra weight last year for eschatologists with 2012 being the end of a cycle in one of the Maya long-count calendars. The Mayas never said it was the ""end of the world,"" just the end of ""a"" world. So they will be there for you to enjoy in the new 14th baktun. Archaeologists aren't sure who built the massive pyramids at Teotihuacan, but the site was long abandoned by the time the Aztecs were dominant (they reckoned it was built by gods). It is easily reachable from Mexico City but as such can be crowded and is packed with vendors. Near the city of Oaxaca, the hilltop ruins of Monte Alban were once home to the Zapotec. Palenque, a Maya site in a lush jungle in Chiapas, is also extremely impressive and interesting, but it is in the interior of the country and not really easy to get to from anywhere. The site's jungle seclusion gives a trip there a more adventurous feel. Expect to pay extra at these sites if you want to shoot video or use a tripod. Fees are posted near the entrances. It will likely be hot (in the summer especially), but vendors inside and out of the parks offer drinks as well as a vast array of trinkets, ranging from respectable to ridiculous. Mysterious swims . Mexico's beaches are plentiful, varied and justifiably a major draw. This year, I went for the more sedate environs of Tulum, a nice uncrowded beach with perfect turquoise water (and a beachside Maya ruin). But the cenotes are much more unusual and interesting. Cenotes are a geological occurrence that are found in the Yucatan and very few other places. Because most of the peninsula sits on a limestone shelf, there are no surface rivers, and rainwater quickly seeps underground where it gathers and forms subterranean bodies of water known as cenotes. They are present throughout the Yucatan and some have been developed into near-theme parks, where you pay a substantial admission price and there are vehicles, boats, zip lines and more. Others are tiny sinkholes known mainly to locals and are free if you can find them. Many fall somewhere in between with a small admission fee (equivalent of $5-$10), perhaps a changing area and maybe some lights or ropes. Other than that, it's just a natural swimming hole. Some go underground for hundreds of meters or more, and they are a popular attraction for intermediate divers. They're also perfect for just plain swimming. The Yucatan is hot and sticky; the water in cenotes is fresh and ice cold since they are partially or completely underground. In some cases, sunlight shines through holes in the cavern ceiling, illuminating the beautifully clear, blue-tinted water giving it an otherworldly feel. And many cenotes attract swallows, which you might -- as I did -- mistake for bats. They constantly fly in and out squeaking busily. Though the clear water might trick your brain into thinking you're in a sterile pool, you are not. There is wildlife present, mostly in the form of little fish that will nibble at your feet if you are still, as well as the occasional turtle or snake. Some recommended cenotes for swimming: . X'kekÃ©n near Valladolid is a beautiful underground spot. Cristalino off the main highway near Playa del Carmen is mostly exposed and has a fun cliff you can jump off (it's only a 15 foot or so drop). Grand Cenote near Tulum has some exposed and some subterranean areas and lots of wildlife running or swimming around. So whether you go to Mexico for cave swimming and ancient sites or for mole and margaritas, it'll be worth it. Confia en mi -- trust me on that.","Beauty of Mexico shouldn't be overlooked because of violence, author argues .
The country's distinctive regional cuisine and ancient past are undeniably alluring .
For otherworldly relaxation, underground swimming holes await in the Yucatan ."
"(CNN) -- How do the world's busiest airports rate when it comes to getting planes off the ground on time? We've taken the top 20 airports in terms of total passenger numbers and ranked them according to how often flights take-off with 15 minutes of the scheduled departure time.

"(CNN) -- Boston bombing suspect Dzhokar Tsarnaev has tweeted since the Boston Marathon bombings on what two friends of his tell CNN is his Twitter account. His tweets included one at 1:43 a.m. Wednesday that said, ""I'm a stress free kind of guy."" On Monday at 8:04 p.m. -- hours after the bombings -- he tweeted a quote from rapper Jay-Z and a 1970s R&B song, ""Ain't no love in the heart of the city."" The tweet added, ""stay safe people."" Shortly after midnight, on Tuesday morning, he tweeted, ""There are people that know the truth but stay silent & there are people that speak the truth but we don't hear them cuz they're the minority."" Tsarnaev uses the handle ""J_tsar"" and does not describe himself in the profile, which reads only, ""Salam aleikum,"" a greeting among Muslims. The profile photo is the face of a lion with its mouth open, baring its fangs. He has tweeted a dozen times since the bombing. The most recent tweet is one he retweeted on Wednesday from Mufti Ismail Menk, who identifies himself as a Muslim scholar. ""Attitude can take away your beauty no matter how good looking you are or it could enhance your beauty, making you adorable,"" the tweet reads. Another tweet from Tsarnaev on Tuesday was a quote from rapper Eminem: ""Nowadays everybody wanna talk like they got somethin to say but nothin comes out when they move their lips; just a bunch of gibberish."" After another Twitter account posted a photo Tuesday saying it showed a man who was going to propose to his girlfriend at the marathon in Boston and found her dead, Tsarnaev tweeted a two-word response: ""fake story."" Another of the suspect's tweets, an apparent response to someone else's tweet, reads, "" and they what 'god hates dead people?' Or victims of tragedies? Lol those people are cooked."" Also Tuesday, Tsarnaev tweeted, ""So then I says to him, I says, relax bro my beard is not loaded."" On Friday, another Twitter user retweeted that message, and added the words, ""But my backpack is."" Other items that he wrote, well before the Boston bombings, on the social media site may offer more details pertinent to the investigation. On August 10, 2012, for instance, Tsarnaev wrote -- in response to another user -- ""Boston marathon isn't a good place to smoke tho."" The context of this conservation, however, was not known.","NEW: A cryptic tweet last August refers to the Boston Marathon .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Rodney King, whose videotaped beating by police ultimately led to the 1992 Los Angeles riots, was arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence on Tuesday, police said. King was behind the wheel of a 1994 Mitsubishi when he was pulled over in Moreno Valley, in Southern California's Riverside County, the city's police department reported. Officers saw King -- who has acknowledged a longstanding drinking problem -- commit ""several traffic violations,"" a police statement said. ""A preliminary evaluation of the driver indicated he was possibly driving while impaired. The subject was transported to the Moreno Valley Police Department for a further evaluation,"" police said. He was booked after that further evaluation, they said. King's 1991 beating by Los Angeles police officers after a traffic stop left him with skull fractures and brain and kidney damage. It was captured on video by a nearby resident, and four officers were indicted as a result. But their trial the following year led to three acquittals and a mistrial in the predominantly white suburb of Simi Valley, verdicts that set off three days of riots in African-American neighborhoods. By the time it was over, 55 people were dead, more than 2,000 were hurt, and property damage exceeded $1 billion. Two of the officers were later convicted of federal civil rights charges, and King won $3.8 million in damages from the city in a civil suit. King was on parole for robbery at the time of the beating and has had several run-ins with the law in the ensuing years. He served a 90-day jail term in 1996 for a hit-and-run involving his wife at the time, and pleaded guilty in 2004 to reckless driving and driving under the influence of a controlled substance. In March, he was cited for driving without a license after being pulled over in Arcadia, California.","King was booked on suspicion of driving under the influence .

"(CNN) -- To better understand Portugal's economic challenges look no further than Guimaraes; its oldest city and the cradle of my nation. In the 1980s and 1990s, this city was an industry boom town with factories lining the valley. Today many of these are gathering dust while others rust, as the economic crisis and competition from China take their toll. But despite the doom and gloom, there is one Portuguese industry that's making great strides. Read more: Islam and democracy can work in EU, says Turkish Deputy PM . Shoemaking, one of the most traditional and oldest industries in the country, is mapping out a new future by exporting its way out of the crisis. And some are discovering new ways to gain traction overseas. We visit a shoemaker where, on one of the factory floors, workers stitch, sew, glue and lace up the company's product. The shoes range from the practical and functional, to outright edgy. Read more: Finnish PM: Eurozone nations must follow the rules . Stamped on the side of each shoe is a sketch of a fly. This is the company's logo, and its brand name is Fly London. It's entirely ""Made in Portugal"" -- but distinctively un-Portuguese.

Marketing drives and innovation has helped grow the industry's exports by 6% every year for the past five years. For the Portuguese government, which has been pinning its hopes on traditional sectors such as this one, the industry offers a glimmer of hope for a country trying to get out of its debt quagmire. And with the Portuguese economy expected to shrink by 2.3% this year, industries like this are more than just examples of innovation -- they are the glue holding a fragmented economy together.","Despite economic gloom, one Portuguese industry is expanding its export market .

"(CNN) -- On December 11, 1997, the world agreed that climate change needed to be tackled. The grandly named United Nations Framework on Climate Change adopted the Kyoto Protocol on that day, and it was eventually ratified by 191 countries. Now it's about to expire with a whimper. Of the major industrial powers, only the European Union is prepared to continue adhering to the Kyoto pact's provisions on cutting greenhouse gases into 2013. Canada, Russia and Japan have already said they won't. The United States never ratified the agreement. So attention is turning to devising a ""Kyoto 2.0."" CNN Special: Five cities fighting for climate survival . This week, nearly 200 delegations have gathered in Qatar to plan for a new international climate pact that would come into effect in 2020. But there are huge disagreements between developed and developing countries over sharing the burden. The Kyoto agreement envisaged binding cuts in emissions by the industrialized world -- but not by rapidly industrializing countries like China and India. They are now the largest and third-largest generator of carbon emissions, respectively, and developing countries account for more than half the world's emissions, according to the International Energy Agency. Read more: How wasted food is destroying the environment . The global economic slowdown has helped curb emissions in the developed world. But China and the United States were together responsible for more than 40% of emissions in 2009. U.S. emissions of carbon dioxide have risen by 10.5% since 1990. And China is heavily reliant on coal -- the most carbon-intensive of fossil fuels -- to drive its economic growth. The stakes for the environmental health of the globe and its citizens have gotten a lot higher in the last 15 years, amid widespread crop failures in the Northern Hemisphere, changing weather patterns, acidifying oceans and a record ice melt in the Arctic Ocean. Right now, a Russian tanker carrying liquefied natural gas is steaming through the Arctic on its way to Japan -- the first such vessel ever to take the route, thanks to thinner ice cover. Read more: Images from space track relentless spread of humanity . The last decade has seen nine of the hottest years on record. And in a new report, the World Bank cites the ""nearly unanimous"" prediction by scientists that the globe will warm by as much as 4 degrees Celsius this century. It expects the consequences to include ""the inundation of coastal cities; increasing risks for food production potentially leading to higher malnutrition rates; many dry regions becoming dryer, wet regions wetter."" ""Recent extreme heat waves such as in Russia in 2010 are likely to become the new normal. ... Tropical South America, central Africa, and all tropical islands in the Pacific are likely to regularly experience heat waves of unprecedented magnitude and duration,"" according to the World Bank study. The World Meteorological Organization, a U.N. agency, reported last week that global carbon dioxide emissions had risen by 50% since 1990. There's fresh evidence that they are still rising, and an overwhelming majority of climate scientists say the warming of the planet is accelerating, with consequences we can't predict. Scientists describe this as the ""cascade of uncertainties."" Read more: Arab youth offers hope for Doha climate talks . The WMO calculates that the volume of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has now reached 390.9 parts per million, roughly 40% higher than the level before the Industrial Revolution. 375 billion tons of carbon have been released into the atmosphere since 1750. About half has been absorbed by the oceans and the Earth's biosphere; the rest will remain in the atmosphere for centuries, gradually cooking the planet. Read more: Greenhouse gases reached record highs in 2011, says U.N. study . The latest data from the WMO also shows that emissions of nitrous oxide are 20% higher than in the preindustrial era, and are accelerating. That's a cause for concern because nitrous oxide is much more ""toxic"" that carbon dioxide; its impact on the climate is about 300 times greater. About 40% of the nitrous oxide emitted is from human activity, according to WMO estimates. There are glimmers of renewed interest in climate change. President Barack Obama, in his victory speech on the night of the election, said he wanted to ""pass on a country that isn't threatened by the destructive power of a warming planet."" The European Union has already cut in its emissions by one-fifth, compared with 1990, and is considering extending that to 30% by 2020. A U.N. program is encouraging small-scale projects that address warming at the local level. One such project is in the sprawling Indian city of Ahmedabad, where a fleet of buses running on compressed natural gas is reducing air pollution. In a city of 7 million, one-fifth of commuters have jumped off their motorcycles and scooters and onto the buses. Read more: Chasing down the world's vanishing glaciers . But there is already widespread doubt that at the global level, aspirations will be matched by deeds. Three years ago, at the abortive climate talks in Copenhagen, Denmark, rich countries promised the poor they would raise $100 billion by 2020 to help them cope with climate change. Budget pressures in developed countries make that target look very distant now. Nongovernmental organizations like Oxfam are lobbying for new taxes on the aviation and shipping industries to help raise the money. They contrast the rapid recovery in the U.S. from the effects of Hurricane Sandy with the disastrous consequences from the same storm for Haiti, where up to 2 million people may face malnutrition after crops were washed away. The notion of shared sacrifice is not one familiar to climate talks. China never tires of pointing out that while it is the largest emitter of carbon dioxide, its emissions per capita are still far lower than those of the U.S. But that may not be for long: Last year alone, they rose 9%. The danger, according to multiple scientific studies, is that without a redoubling of efforts to curb emissions, the goal enshrined in Kyoto, Japan, of restraining warming to 2 degrees Celsius this century, compared with the preindustrial era, will soon be unattainable. Right now, the goal of limiting warming to 2 degrees by 2100 seems like a pipe dream. If emissions continue their current path, the target will be breached within two decades. Read more: Raising a stink about global sanitation . The European Environment Agency says the average temperature on the continent in the last decade was already 1.3 degrees Celsius above the preindustrial level. The vast majority of glaciers in Europe are retreating; river flows are decreasing throughout Southern and Eastern Europe. ""By the late 21st century, European plant species are projected to shift several hundred kilometers to the north, forests are likely to contract in the south and expand in the north, and about half of the mountain plant species may face extinction,"" the EEA says. Farmers in the U.S. Midwest have just endured the worst drought in 50 years; the bread baskets of Ukraine and Russia have similarly shriveled in the face of intense heat. Technologies exist that will allow humanity to make a rapid dent on emissions. Renewable energy accounts for double the amount of power it did just six years ago. Carbon sinks deep underground can capture and store emissions from gas flaring. Better vehicle emissions standards, reforestation and a developed carbon trading market would all help. There are all sorts of green gestures at the 18th meeting of the United Nations Framework on Climate Change in Qatar, one of the world's highest emitters of carbon dioxide per capita. Examples are ""paperless"" documentation and buses run on natural gas to ferry delegates to the conference center, which is partly powered by solar panels. But the political will required of 194 delegations to bring the world closer to a new climate pact is yet to be tested.","Nearly 200 delegations have gathered in Qatar to plan for a new international climate pact .

"New York (CNN) -- The rapid growth in emerging markets over the past decade has made them fertile ground for the development of new approaches to attracting and managing talent. Among the biggest beneficiaries: Ambitious, educated women in Brazil, Russia, India, and China (BRIC). Following the trend in developed nations, BRIC women are graduating from university at rates equal to or exceeding men. As they enter the professional workforce in their home countries, these women have an unparalleled opportunity to leapfrog their Western counterparts. Research from the think tank I set up, Center for Talent Innovation, shows that their career ambitions and commitment overwhelm those of women in the U.S. In my book, ""Winning the War for Talent in Emerging Markets: Why Women are the Solution,"" written with Ripa Rashid, we say some 76% of Chinese women, 80% of Brazilian women, and a whopping 86% of Indian women aspire to the top job, compared to only 52% of their U.S. counterparts. Over 80% in Brazil, Russia and India love their jobs, versus 70% in the U.S. Yet their promising futures too often are derailed by family-rooted ""pulls"" and workplace-centered ""pushes."" Although childcare is one of the most common career killers for women in the United States and Western Europe, it is rarely a serious problem in the emerging markets. Parents and in-laws frequently live nearby and are willing to pitch in to help care for their grandchildren. Nannies and household help are, for the most part, affordable and readily available. Instead, BRIC women confront a series of family and social pressures that pile onto women when they marry, ratchet up after they have children, and become almost crushing as their parents and in-laws get older. Eldercare is a ticking time bomb, especially in countries where filial piety is tightly woven into the cultural value system. Although elders today represent a net benefit to the female career professional in BRIC markets, demographic projections a huge leap in the percentage of the population over 60. This dramatic shift will land squarely on professional women. While many women in our sample did not have children, the vast majority -- 81% -- do have eldercare responsibilities. ""Daughterly guilt,"" already substantial across the BRICs, actually exceeds maternal guilt in India and China. In spite of the tremendous gains in women's status in the BRICs over the past two decades, gender bias remains an indisputable reality of the workplace. In India and China, over 25% of CTI survey respondents believe women are treated unfairly in the workplace owing to their gender; in India, the number is 45%. More than half of educated women in India and nearly half of their counterparts in China have encountered bias severe enough to make them consider scaling back their career goals -- or quitting altogether. (Russia is the exception, in part owing to a Communist legacy that integrated women into the workplace better than elsewhere in today's emerging markets.) Even a sizable percentage of men agree that women are treated unfairly because of their gender. The most commonly encountered types of bias involve lingering stereotypes about women's abilities and commitment to work. These deeply rooted prejudices can impact women's careers in a range of ways, from curtailed assignments to smaller salaries to penalties for taking maternity leave. Women also have to fight cultural stereotypes that bar them from coveted assignments. More than half of the women surveyed are interested in international assignments, with most seeing them as critical to their career advancement. Yet because it's assumed that a woman's responsibilities are to her home, and that her husband and children will take precedence over commitment to her career, she is often passed over in favor of a man. But assertiveness can be difficult for women brought up in cultures that place great value on women's submissiveness and reticence, as in India and China, or consider it a trait that detracts from women's essential femininity. Many women surveyed felt crippled by this cultural bind, a sense further reinforced by the absence of senior female role models, mentors, sponsors and access to leadership training. Time and again, the women spoke of how hungry they are for more support from their employers and how much they would benefit from programs that would help them break out of their shells. A nuanced understanding of the cultural and social influences is essential to doing business effectively anywhere, yet the ""think global, act local"" mantra that is the cornerstone of many successful business strategies rarely extends to managing talented women in emerging markets. Employers who wish to maximize their potential need to understand their complicated career dynamics. Only by creating policies and practices that enable ambitious, educated women to flourish will companies ensure that the tomorrow's leaders get the skills and support they need today.","Report: Women in Brazil, Russia, India and China more ambitious than U.S. counterparts .

"(CNN) -- The lawyer for the neighborhood watch leader who fatally shot unarmed 17-year-old Trayvon Martin in Sanford, Florida, said Thursday that his client has received about $200,000 from supporters. Orlando lawyer Mark O'Mara told CNN's ""AC360"" that George Zimmerman told him Wednesday of the donations as they were trying to shut down his Internet presence to avoid concerns about possible impersonators and problems with his Twitter and Facebook accounts. ""He asked me what to do with his PayPal accounts and I asked him what he was talking about,"" O'Mara told Anderson Cooper. ""And he said those were the accounts that had the money from the website he had. And there was about 200, $204,000 that had come in to date."" O'Mara had said earlier this month that he believed Zimmerman had no money. ""I think he's indigent for costs,"" he said, adding that Zimmerman's relatives had few assets. Zimmerman, 28, was released Monday on $150,000 bail, 10% of which his family put up to secure his release. He is accused of second-degree murder in the February 26 death of Martin, who was African-American. Critics have accused him of racially profiling Martin and unjustly killing him. He has said he shot in self-defense. Asked whether knowledge of the money might have made a difference to Judge Kenneth Lester Jr., who presided at Zimmerman's bond hearing, O'Mara said, ""It might have."" O'Mara continued, ""I'm certainly going to disclose it to the court tomorrow -- coincidentally, we have a hearing."" He said he was prepared to ""deal with any fallout,"" but predicted Lester would not feel misled. ""I told him what I knew at the time, which was exactly what I was aware of."" The money has been placed in a secure account since O'Mara learned about it, he said, adding, ""Nobody's touching it until we figure out how to handle it."" But criminal defense attorney Mark Geragos said Lester might not react benignly. ""I know a lot of judges who would remand the guy back into custody immediately,"" he said. ""If you've got more money stashed in an account and you could just pay the bond and be gone, that gives a lot of judges concern."" Though the account has been closed, O'Mara said he intends to open a legal defense fund for Zimmerman. ""I've had dozens, hundreds actually, of people wanting to donate,"" he said. O'Mara, who said he charges $400 per hour for family law cases, estimated Zimmerman's defense costs could reach $1 million. ""You can really go through a lot of money on a case like this, with the intensity of it,"" he said. Although details of the shooting remain murky, it is known that Martin ventured out from the Sanford home of his father's fiancee and went to a nearby convenience store, where he bought a bag of candy and an iced tea. On his way back, he had a confrontation with Zimmerman, who shot him. Zimmerman had called 911 to complain about a suspicious person in the neighborhood, according to authorities. In the call, Zimmerman said he was following Martin after the teen started to run, prompting the dispatcher to tell him, ""We don't need you to do that."" Zimmerman pursued Martin anyway but then said he lost sight of him. According to an Orlando Sentinel story later confirmed by Sanford police, Zimmerman told authorities that after he briefly lost track of Martin, the teen approached him. After the two exchanged words, Zimmerman said, he reached for his cell phone, and then Martin punched him in the nose. Zimmerman said Martin pinned him to the ground and began slamming his head onto the sidewalk, leading to the shooting. Police have said Zimmerman was not immediately charged because there was no evidence to disprove his account that he'd acted in self-defense. A police report indicated he was bleeding from the nose and the back of his head. Watch Anderson Cooper 360° weeknights 10pm ET.

"Washington (CNN) -- Miami police have engaged in a pattern of excessive use of force through officer-involved shootings, the Justice Department said on Tuesday. The Justice Department conducted a comprehensive investigation and found that officers intentionally shot at people on 33 separate occasions from 2008 until 2011 and the police department concluded three of those instances were unjustified. The Justice Department said a number of additional shootings were ""questionable at best."" The findings also noted that seven officers participated in more than a third of the shootings in question. The Justice Department also concluded the police department did not conduct timely investigations of such shootings. In addition, the findings said the police had ""deficient tactics"" and that improper actions had been taken by specialized police units. The review started in November 2011 after seven young African-American men were fatally shot by officers over eight months. Community leaders appealed to the federal government to take action. Roy Austin, the deputy assistant attorney general for civil rights, said there had been a similar investigation of the Miami Police Department a decade ago. Officials thought improvements had been made and closed the case without obtaining a court-supervised agreement. Austin said the Justice Department this time plans to get a plan that would fall under judicial oversight. ""Miami has to reform deadly force and has to do it for a sustainable period of time so we don't have to come back in a decade,"" said Austin. The civil rights investigation looked only at patterns within the police department and did not address whether specific officers should face criminal charges.","Justice Department review looked at shootings involving police .

"(CNN) -- Lawyer and human rights activist Seodi White has long been an outspoken campaigner for gender justice in Malawi, a country where half its women are married before the age of 18. As the head of the Malawian chapter of Women in Law in Southern Africa (WLSA), White is at the forefront of the battle against inequality, traveling around the country to promote education and to stop young girls from giving up on school and marrying in their early teens. But the prominent activist, who is herself the mother of a young daughter, is not only concerned with the rights of teenage girls. She is also targeting cultural practices that harm older, vulnerable women in Malawi. 'Widow cleansing' One such custom, prevalent in the southern tip of the landlocked country, is ""widow cleansing,"" a traditional practice in which a widow is expected to have sexual relations, ""in order to cleanse her,"" explains White. ""There is a belief that if she does not sleep with someone, the spirit of her dead husband will come and visit upon her and her family will be cursed,"" she adds. White says that the practice is not forced upon widows. Instead, she says, the tradition has become so much part of the culture that widows themselves call for it. ""It's a mindset issue,"" says White. ""Even the widows, they've told me, 'I don't want to die, I don't want a curse to come to my husband.' They cry to be cleansed."" Read this: Married at 13 to man in his 70s . White says the tradition, which involves unprotected sex, thus increasing the chances of HIV infection, has been turned into a business. ""There are professional cleansers in villages,"" says White. She says these men charge widows up to $50 for their services, in a country where the minimum wage is less than $1 per day. In recent times, there have been several initiatives by White's NGO, as well as other groups, to try and change the situation. One effort is to target the ""professional cleansers"" in attempt to get them to change their ways. ""Some have actually come out in the open and said: 'I used to be a commercial cleanser, I'm HIV positive, I've stopped, it's not fine and I go village by village telling other commercial cleansers to stop this, it's a risky taboo behavior.'"" The power of education . A daughter of a professor of English, White grew up in Malawi in a relatively privileged family. She received her law degree in Botswana before moving to the UK to focus on gender and development studies. White saw first-hand the difference that education can make to a woman's life, and that's why all her efforts to promote gender equality -- from campaigning against child marriage and domestic abuse to protecting widows' rights through her work as a lawyer -- have been shaped by the transformative power of education. ""In this country, to get ahead in life, to beat poverty, you need education,"" she says. Read this: 'Why women will change world' ""I know the difference between an uneducated woman in Malawi and a person of education, as I am, and I decided to use my position to uplift others,"" adds White. ""I decided I'm going to dedicate my life to dealing with injustice, just because I don't like it when a structure or system puts others in poverty, puts others in a position of inequality,"" adds White. 'The dispossession of widows' Another campaign spearheaded by White is the fight against the prevalent culture of property grabbing, one of the most deep-rooted forms of discrimination suffered by widows in Malawi. White says that all across the country widows are at risk of having their matrimonial property taken by their late husband's relatives, often leaving them and their children homeless. ""The way our family structures are done is that when a man and a woman get married they are not considered related,"" says White. ""A man is still looked at by his family as he is theirs and the woman is looked at by her family as she is theirs."" Read this: 'Give African women a voice,' say activists . White says this entrenched culture, coupled with a prevalent assumption that women do not have an earning capacity, has condemned many widows to acute poverty. ""When the husband dies,"" says White, ""his people, they come in and say, 'what did our son buy in this house? Where is the stuff?' They don't look at the stuff as belonging to the family."" WSLA fought hard for more than 10 years to advance women's rights to keep their marital estate, calling for reform in Malawi's inheritance laws. Its campaign, which met strong resistance, finally succeeded in 2011 when the country's parliament voted to make property grabbing an offense and protect the spouse's and children's share in the deceased's assets. ""A law is a law -- it might not be like it's working immediately, but it's got staying power,"" says White, adding that more needs to be done to raise awareness about the reforms and to inform widows of their rights. White says that despite all the difficulties, it is victories like this that make her decision to commit her life in the fight against gender injustice worthwhile. ""I've been working on this business for 15 years; They've been moments of hope,"" she says.","Seodi White is a Malawian lawyer and women's rights activist .

"(CNN) -- The head coach of the Australian cricket team has been replaced ahead of the Ashes, following a string of poor performances by the sport's traditional powerhouse. Cricket Australia confirmed on Monday that Mickey Arthur had been replaced as coach by Darren Lehmann, the current Queensland coach who was touring England as coach of the Australia A squad . On a turbulent day for Australian cricket, captain Michael Clarke also stood down as a team selector. The Ashes, the regular series of five Test matches between Australia and England that is one of the most celebrated rivalries in world sport, is scheduled to begin on July 10 in Nottingham. England enters the series as the bookmakers' favorite and the current holder of the Ashes, having regained them in 2009 and defended them successfully in 2011. A South African former domestic cricketer, Arthur had coached Australia since November 2011, following a five-year stint in charge of the South Africa national side. ""Naturally I'm very disappointed with how this has all ended,"" said Arthur, who was the first foreigner to coach Australia and had been contracted to lead the team until the end of the 2015 World Cup. ""I certainly wanted to see the job through but I accept that the team hasn't been completely galvanized under my leadership and our performances have been inconsistent. ""I'm certainly a believer in good culture and traditions much like all Australians and feel we were starting to get a shift in the right direction. We certainly need the team to be absolutely unified if we're any chance of beating the English."" Lehmann represented Australia in 27 Test matches between 1998 and 2004, scoring 1798 runs. ""Darren Lehmann has been appointed as the new Australia head coach,"" said Cricket Australia chief executive officer James Sutherland. ""He has had outstanding success in a short time with Queensland Cricket winning the Bupa Sheffield Shield, Ryobi One-Day Cup and KFC T20 Big Bash League all within the last two years. ""Lehmann will be contracted until June 2015 -- post the 2015 Cricket World Cup."" Arthur's dismissal comes amid troubled times for Australian cricket, on and off the pitch. This month the one-day side was knocked out in the group stages of the ICC Champions Trophy, failing to win a match in a tournament it had won the previous two times it had been held. Earlier, the side had been beaten 4-0 in Tests during its tour of India. Once the dominant force in international cricket, Australia also recently lost the series against South Africa, going down 1-0 in Tests in November, and against England, losing 4-0 in a series of one-day internationals in 2012. Poor discipline and rumors of disunity have plagued the squad, with four players -- including then vice-captain Shane Watson -- controversially ruled ineligible to play during the recent Indian tour for failing to complete a ""homework"" assignment set by Arthur on how to improve performances. Earlier this month, batsman David Warner was disciplined for throwing a punch at England player Joe Root in the early hours of the morning in a Birmingham bar, just weeks after the Australian had found himself in hot water for an expletive filled Twitter rant at journalists. He pleaded guilty to bringing the game into disrepute over both incidents.","Mickey Arthur is replaced as Australia cricket coach by Darren Lehmann .

"New York (CNN) -- It's finally here! No, not the post-Christmas store sales or the impending New Year's Eve festivities. I'm talking about the annual avalanche of ""Year in Review"" articles re-telling us about the ""top"" stories of 2011: The Royal Wedding, Osama Bin Laden's death, the Arab Spring, Occupy Wall Street, Charlie Sheen's meltdown, blah, blah, blah. Why does the media feel compelled to explain to us yet again the events that we all collectively experienced and were already covered ad nauseum just a few months ago? I prefer that we focus not on the past, but on the events we wish had happened in the past year. Or at least the ones I wish had occurred. Of course, I'm a comedian, so the events I hoped for may not actually be good for our country, but potentially they would have been great for comedy. So here are the top political headlines that I would have loved to see in 2011: . 1. ""Texas Gov. Rick Perry forgets his first name."" Who can forget (except for maybe Rick Perry) the November 9 presidential debate when Perry famously blanked when trying to remember the name of the third government agency he wanted to eliminate? I wish Perry had done this more often -- forgetting dates, statistics, maybe even one of the names of the other presidential candidates during a debate, forcing him to cover with lines like: ""I have to disagree with the guy who has been married a bunch of times and has a really weird first name."" (Can you guess who I mean?) 2. ""Joe Biden goes on a national speaking tour."" Vice President Biden is President Obama's ""fat friend"" who makes Obama look more attractive every time Biden opens his mouth. His penchant for putting his foot in his mouth is a bad trait for a politician, but as a comedian, I view Biden's speaking gaffes as Christmas year round. Joe Biden is the guy who thoughtfully remarked: ""God rest her soul,"" when speaking of the prime minister of Ireland's mother. Only problem was that the prime minister's mother was still very much alive. And who can forget when Biden exclaimed at a campaign event: ""Stand up, Chuck, let 'em see ya,"" to Missouri state Sen. Chuck Graham, a man who uses a wheelchair. And earlier this year, Biden gave us even more comedy when he announced at an event in Indiana: ""Senator Gard is here, wanna recognize him, I was told he was here."" Which would've been fine if Senator Gard's first name was not Beverly and if ""he"" was not actually a ""she."" In 2012, we need to get Biden out of the White House and in front of a microphone as often as possible. 3. ""U.S. Congress agrees to trial by combat to resolve disagreements."" Finally, something that is both potentially hilarious and could end the gridlock in Washington. This battle could have taken place at The Medieval Times theme restaurant conveniently located in nearby Hanover, Maryland. There, Democrats and Republicans from both the House and Senate would have squared off in epic battle of steed and steel as they waged attacks on each other armed with lances and armor piercing maces to determine which political party's agenda would be adopted. 4. ""Mitt Romney challenges every American to a $10,000 bet."" Romney -- fresh off challenging Texas Gov. Rick Perry to a $10,000 bet about his stand(s) on health care -- doubles down by offering to bet any American citizen $10,000 about any issue of their choosing. This could have been a mini-stimulus plan for many American families who might have prevailed on the bet. 5. ""Democratic congressmen Anthony Weiner and David Wu remain in Congress and keep tweeting and emailing people."" These guys were both comedy gold but only while they were still in Congress. Weiner, of course, tweeted photos of himself partially nude to different people -- which on one level was the most original (and comedic) constituent outreach program in the history of Congress. David Wu's troubles were not as well documented by the media. This Oregon congressman resigned because of a sex scandal but not before he had emailed to congressional staffers a photo of himself dressed like a tiger. If Wu had stayed in Congress, we could have been treated to him wearing even more costumes -- maybe Wu would have attended Congressional committee hearings dressed like the donkey from ""Shrek"" or even as ""Harry Potter. "" But alas we will never know the full comedy potential of these two because of their abrupt resignations from Congress. 6. ""Rick Perry makes even more horrible campaign commercials."" Perry's campaign ad opposing gays serving openly in the military may have statistically been one of the most ""disliked"" videos ever on YouTube but it was loved by comedians. No ad ever featured such a bizarre mixed message: Perry bragging about his opposition to gay marriage while paradoxically wearing a jacket made famous by one of the gay cowboy characters in ""Brokeback Mountain."" I wish Perry would have done a new campaign ad talking about protecting the environment while dressed in a suit made of baby seal pups covered in oil. 7. ""Sarah Palin announces her candidacy for president of the United States"" This is the headline I most wished for in 2011. Palin has the potential to eclipse the golden age of political comedy provided to comedians by George W. Bush. Her gaffes and missteps have secured her a place in the Dan Quayle political comedy museum -- which I hope to build one day. Who can forget Palin referring to the fighting in Libya as a ""squirmish"" -- a word which sends my spell check into an endless loop. Or Palin sharing her foreign policy prowess with the comment: ""But obviously, we've got to stand with our North Korean allies."" And just a few months ago, she gave us this comedy classic: Paul Revere warned the British during the Revolutionary war. Ahh...I get a bit misty thinking about what could have been if Sarah ran for President. Don't get me wrong, from a comedic point of view, 2011 was a pretty good year, but I think we all can agree that it could have been funnier.

"(CNN) -- As he strode on stage to accept the 1999 Rory Peck award for hard news journalism, Sorious Samura struggled to find the words that would fit the moment. He hadn't expected to win the prestigious prize and so hadn't prepared a speech. Looking out across audience, the pioneering video journalist made the snap decision to speak his mind rather than proffer faux gratification. ""I stood there and thought of my people,"" he recalls, before asking, ""Where were you when my people were killing, raping and maiming themselves?"" ""You are tripping over cables in Kosovo, why didn't you come and cover our war and now you are clapping for me. You can have your award."" See also: Child soldier on killing in Sierra Leone . In a decorated film career that has also brought Peabody and Emmy awards, Samura has rarely submitted his professional or personal style to convention. This strident nonconformity has made him a compelling storyteller -- a fact perhaps best emphasized by the on and off camera tactics he employed to make ""Cry Freetown,"" his debut film about the brutal civil war that tore apart his native Sierra Leone. When the notoriously violent forces of the Revolutionary United Front marched on Freetown, the country's capital in 1999, Samura, unlike many of his colleagues and compatriots, refused to flee the city. Instead he waited for the rebel army, gained their trust and embedded himself with their rank and file soldiers. His plan was to document the violence, torture, rape and use of child soldiers by the RUF and their government backed opponents which came to define the conflict. Read related: How diamonds fuel Africa's conflicts . Samura hoped his film would make it out of Sierra Leone and force the international community to intervene to end the war. ""I was just hell-bent on actually using my own weapon, which was the camera, to call for help because we were just left by ourselves to die. Nothing was going to stop me,"" he says. ""For me there was just no choice. I had to go out and film and hopefully stay alive and get the world to see what is happening in my country."" See also: Kenyan reporters win CNN journalist awards . To the untrained eye such tactics may seem reckless. For Samura however, experiencing his subject matter is an essential part of the storytelling process. He has assiduously applied this concept to all of his documentary film work. More recent efforts have focused on the topics of hunger in Ethiopia, aids patients in Zambia and the plight of refugees in Sudan. In each project Samura has immersed himself in the lives of his protagonists in an attempt to comprehend the challenges of their everyday existence. When he filmed a displaced Sudanese family in his 2004 film, ""Living with Refugees,"" Samura only permitted himself to eat when they ate and drink from the same sources, mostly dried-up rivers, as he followed them across dangerous terrain from Darfur to Chad. ""To understand a man's problem you have got to walk at least a mile in his shoes,"" Samura says. ""If I really need to tell these people's stories, if I am the driver who will articulate their suffering, then I have to experience it."" ""It is sometimes easy for people to say, I understand what you are going through, I can imagine...that is not true. Sometimes you can only live it to believe, to understand."" See also: From war orphan to teen ballerina . But by repeatedly drawing attention to such traumatic and challenging subject matter, some critics have accused Samura of focusing only on the negative in Africa. The filmmaker who himself had to scavenge for food in his Freetown youth rejects this viewpoint out of hand. He says you have to tell these stories no matter how uncomfortable it may make some people feel. ""There are things that I believe that I can say that ought to be said about Africa....even if they are harsh realities but they ought to be said."" ""African stories are like onions,"" he says. ""You have got to take time to peel those layers and of course, like onions ... it's going to burn your eyes. You will get a story that is not just about objectivity...it is the whole picture."" While Samura is keen to recognize that there have been many positive developments on the continent, he also highlights the importance of Africans reporting their own stories and creating their own narrative, no matter how difficult. He believes this will lend more authenticity to the chronicling of life in modern Africa than foreign journalists coming in with their own ready-made preconceptions. ""Only Africans can tell their stories from the bottom up, from the African perspective, like a prism so that people will be able to see."" See also: Film pioneer helps Rwanda build new identity . If a new generation of African journalists can be inspired to take ownership of their own story with honesty and conviction, Samura believes the risks he has taken to make his films will have paid off. ""One thing that would make me believe I have achieved something for real in this particular discipline, is to see African journalists worship ... on the altar of truth,"" he says. ""African journalists should realize that they owe no obligations to tribe, to party, or to wealthy businessmen or to political leaders. All their responsibility is the truth."" ""We have to find that pride in ourselves. I would rather die a poor man than trade what I have right now... my integrity.""

"(CNN) -- What would happen if you posted derogatory comments about your boss on a Facebook page that you knew would be read by your co-workers? How would your boss react if in those Facebook posts you called him or her a ""coward,"" a ""domestic enemy,"" and boasted that you wouldn't be following the boss' instructions in the future? And what if your boss is the president of the United States and you are a sergeant in the U.S. Marine Corps? That's essentially the case of Sgt. Gary Stein, a nine-year veteran of the U.S. Marine Corps, who is on the verge of being discharged from the military for making comments on Facebook about his boss: the commander-in-chief, President Barack Obama. Stein posted comments on both his personal Facebook page and on The Armed Forces Tea Party Facebook page he created, mocking the president. On those pages he referred to President Obama as a ""domestic enemy,"" a coward, and even superimposed President Obama's face on the poster for the movie ""Jackass."" But the comment that really drew the ire of Marine Corps brass was this post from Stein: . ""As an Active Duty Marine I say 'Screw Obama' and I will not follow all orders from him ... has [sic] for saluting Obama as commander-in-chief ... I will not!"" It's pretty clear that Stein will not be adding President Obama as a friend on Facebook any time soon. The U.S. military has alleged that Stein's postings violated military regulations prohibiting partisan political statements while in active service in the military. Consequently, Stein was charged with conduct ""prejudicial to good order and discipline."" But Stein doesn't see it that way. Stein appeared earlier this week on CNN's ""Starting Point"" arguing that the Facebook posts were not his views as a U.S. Marine, but, ""...my personal opinion as Gary Stein."" Members of the military are free to give their personal opinions about political candidates, but Stein's Facebook post begins: ""As an Active Duty Marine I say 'Screw Obama...' "" This clearly gives the appearance that Stein is speaking as a member of the Marine Corps. Secondly, the Marine Corps motto is the Latin phrase ""Semper Fi,"" which means ""always faithful."" The motto isn't ""faithful only nine to five."" Every Marine I have ever met has made it clear that being a U.S. Marine is a 24-hour a day job. Bottom line: Stein, upon enlisting, agreed to follow the rules of the U.S. Military, which contain express regulations prohibiting certain partisan political speech. As a result of his apparent violations of these regulations, a military panel ruled last week three to zero to discharge Stein from the military. In normal times, this case would have likely received little media coverage. But these are not normal times. Instead, we live in a grotesquely partisan era. Consequently, three Republican congressmen publicly came to Stein's defense: Reps. Allen West, Darrell Issa and Duncan Hunter. Hunter even sent a personal letter to the Marine Corps in which he stated in part: ""I urge the Marine Corps to withdraw the discharge proceedings and allow Sgt Stein to complete his enlistment."" West, a former U.S. Army officer, issued a statement paradoxically conceding that Stein should face some form of discipline -- although less than discharge -- but then in essence pointed his finger at President Obama as the cause for Stein's conduct: ""If America had leadership that gained the respect of our military, instead of simply using them as stage props for speeches, this atmosphere would not exist."" Adding to the growing partisanship of this case is that the lawyer now representing Stein -- Gary Kreep -- was one of the lead organizers of the birther movement, which contended falsely that President Obama was not born in America and, thus, not legitimately the president. Kreep even created a 28-minute infomercial on the birther issue in which he hawked ""Got a Birth Certificate"" bumper stickers for $30 each. You have to wonder if Stein had made the comments at issue about a Republican president if these men would be offering the same support. (It's a rhetorical question: We all know the answer.) Inserting partisan politics into our military is dangerous. Our nation's military cannot be divided into political factions where loyalty is based on whether service members agree with the political views of the commander-in-chief. As the U.S. Supreme Court noted when upholding restrictions on partisan politics in the military: We live under ""...the American constitutional tradition of a politically neutral military establishment under civilian control."" There should be zero tolerance by the military for any partisan politicking by active duty service men or women. This is not only ""prejudicial to good order and discipline,"" but could lead to the loss of lives. We already have one dysfunctional institution marred by partisan infighting -- the U.S. Congress - we can't afford another.

"New York (CNN) -- When I was growing up, my friends and I all wanted to be cool -- like Al Pacino, Robert De Niro or, of course, the king of cool at the time: Fonzie. (I should note that I grew up in an Italian neighborhood.) Being ""cool"" was a good thing. Today it appears that being ""cool"" could be a bad thing, at least if you are running for president of the United States. That theory surfaced in an ad from a Republican super PAC headed by Karl Rove. The super PAC American Crossroads argues in its campaign ad that Barack Obama is ""too cool"" to be president. The attack ad shows President Obama ""slow jamming"" the news on Jimmy Fallon's NBC late-night talk show, singing an Al Green song and chugging a beer. (Obama drinking a beer must confuse those Republicans who still think he is a Muslim.) Sure, Obama can sing, spar with late-night comedians and charm talk-show hosts. Still I am not so sure I would classify him as being ""too cool."" To me, Obama is more of a mix of cool and nerdy -- sort of a cross between Denzel Washington and Harry Potter. Obama may have soul, but he likely also has ""Star Wars"" toys. You could even say he may be more geeky than cool. Obama has long collected comic books and when he recently posed for a picture with the actress who played Lt. Uhura on ""Star Trek,"" Obama admitted he was a Trekkie -- he even flashed the Vulcan salute which means ""live long and prosper. On the geek to cool meter, that definitely tips towards geekdom. And yet in today's world, geeks can actually be cool. They're no longer depicted the way they were in the ""Revenge of the Nerds"" movies with pocket protectors, calculator watches and Coke-bottle lens glasses. Geeky people are the model of success, the ultimate expression of cool -- think the late Steve Jobs. At the risk of agreeing with Rove, I think he's correct that Obama would be considered cool. But is that bad? Rove thinks so. Indeed, Rove's ad claims that ""America got one cool president"" but then cites statistics showing job losses for young people. The ad concludes by posing the question: ""After four years of a celebrity president, is your life any better?"" Taking Rove's argument to its logical ""Spock""-type conclusion -- if Obama was not cool, he would be a great president and America would be better off. Let's see if that theory is accurate. No one would argue that George W. Bush was cool. Yet if Rove's proposition is correct, Bush should have been one of the greatest presidents ever. While some may miss Bush -- and those people would be mostly comedians such as myself -- by the time he left office, he had a 22% approval rating, one of the lowest ever for an outgoing president. So it appears that lack of cool does not equal fantastic president. What is Rove's real point? Is it personal? Was Rove picked on as a child by the cool kids in his school? Did they give him wedgies or not let him sit with them at the lunch table in the cafeteria? Is this ad simply Rove's ""Revenge of the Nerds"" moment to lash out at Obama for being the cool guy? Maybe but more likely it's political. Rove knows that the presumptive Republican nominee Mitt Romney is at best ""cool-challenged."" Rove is simply trying to turn one of Obama's assets into a liability. Will it work? Do we want a less than cool president? And if this ad gets traction, will Rove release other ads attacking Obama's strengths? Will we soon see ads claiming Obama is ""too articulate"" or in too good a shape to be president? Only time will tell, but if this is the type of ridiculous argument we are hearing six months from Election Day, I can't even imagine the insanity we will see as we get closer to November 6.

"(CNN) -- When will this recession end? I'm not talking about the economic challenges facing our nation. I'm talking about the severe downturn in the world of political comedy. By picking Paul Ryan as his running mate, Mitt Romney may have energized the Republican Party. But is Ryan all that exciting? He's a middle-aged, conservative white guy from the Midwest. As NBC's Jimmy Fallon aptly joked earlier this week on his late night show: ""Mitt Romney is hoping to energize conservatives with his choice of Paul Ryan as running mate. That's like trying to spice up a bowl of oatmeal with more oatmeal."" Don't get me wrong -- compared with Romney, Paul Ryan is Ashton Kutcher on crack. But even Rush Limbaugh labeled Ryan as ""the last Boy Scout."" Translation: Reliable but boring. The guy who makes politicians funny . Let me give you a little background about the plight of political comedy. When the nation found itself in an economic recession as President Barack Obama was taking office, comedians headed into a comedic depression. George W. Bush was comedy gold for eight years. If we knew how little material Obama would be providing us, comedians would have joined forces to repeal the 22nd Amendment to enable Bush to be president for a third term. (I know that would've been bad for the country, but we, comedians, are a particularly selfish breed -- after all, we won't even share the stage with other performers.) Sure, there have been glimmers of a comedic recovery over the last few years. We perked up when Sarah Palin explored the possibility of running for president. Her candidacy would have been the equivalent of a comedic stimulus package. Who can forget Rep. Anthony Weiner, who famously posted photos of himself in his underwear on Twitter? This controversy harkened back to the comedy boom bestowed upon us by Bill Clinton's sex scandal. And recently, the Republican presidential debates offered some good stuff. Most notably, Rick Perry forgetting the name of the third government agency that he wanted to eliminate. To his credit, Obama has supplied some material, like when he said, ""The Middle East is obviously an issue that has plagued the region for centuries."" Or when Obama claimed he had traveled across the nation visiting our ""57 States."" I know many on the right see Obama as providing much more comedic material than comedians do. They often send me ""jokes"" about Obama on issues like Obamacare or the ""Fast and Furious"" program. While I appreciate the sentiment, here's the cold, hard truth: Conservatives are not funny. I'm being brutally objective here. There are some funny conservative comedians and pundits, but how many can you name? I have my theories why conservatives struggle so horribly when trying to be funny, but I'll keep them to myself because I'm not a mental health professional. In the midst of this comedy recession where we have witnessed a severe contraction in our GDL -- gross domestic laughter -- there is one potential goldmine that could use a bit more exploration. I'm speaking of vice president Joe Biden. Just search on Google the words ""Biden"" and ""gaffes"" and watch your computer's screen fill up with page after page of ""Bidenisms."" A few months ago, while referring to Teddy Roosevelt's famous comment to walk softly and a carry a big stick, Biden said: ""I promise you, the president has a big stick. I promise you."" And now, we have another ""Biden moment"" when he proclaimed that Romney's policies on regulating Wall Street would put, ""y' all back in chains."" Oddly enough, Biden's blunders have not defined him as a comedic figure. At least when compared to say, former Vice President Dan Quayle, who entertained us with gaffe after gaffe, from famously misspelling the word ""potato"" in front of a class of young students (he added an ""e"" at the end) to saying things like, ""It's wonderful to be here in the great state of Chicago."" There are upcoming events that offer some hope that we will emerge from the comedy doldrums. Donald Trump will be attending the Republican National Convention scheduled later this month and has promised a ""big surprise."" Perhaps he will pay homage to Romney at the convention by tipping his hair to him. From Adams to Obama: 10 funny political lines . And we comedians can all dream that at the upcoming Democratic National Convention, Joe Biden will throw away his script and just ad lib his speech. (I would predict that the Secret Service has standing orders to tackle Biden if he tries that.) Even if these events could provide temporary relief, it's unlikely that we will ever return to the political comedy golden years of Clinton and W. Bush. Like many Americans, we'll simply have to learn to make do with less. However, I have an idea that is motivated solely in helping the country and not my career. It may end the toxic political climate that is plaguing us. What about a bipartisan presidential ticket in 2016: ""Sarah Palin and Anthony Weiner""? Think of the possibilities!

"(CNN) -- First, there was the war on drugs. Then came the war on terrorism. Followed by the war on Christmas, women and religion. We seem to love waging wars. And now a new war has broken out: the war on comedy. This war started just a week ago by those defending Rush Limbaugh's infamous attack on Sandra Fluke, a Georgetown law school student who simply offered an opinion Limbaugh didn't like. So, Limbaugh being the ""entertainer"" that he is, responded by calling this young woman a ""slut"" and ""prostitute."" With Limbaugh under attack for his despicable comments, his supporters launched a desperate counterattack to save him by targeting ""liberal"" comedians like Bill Maher and Louie C.K. for their crude and demeaning jokes about Sarah Palin. Their point was that Limbaugh may have been bad, but he's not the only one, so he should be forgiven. (I'd love to see a defendant in a murder trial try this defense.) Thus, the war on comedy was on. The hostilities escalated late last week when Fox News' Greta Van Susteren called for a boycott of the Congressional Correspondents' dinner because Louie C.K. was slated to host the event. (C.K. dropped out of hosting the dinner shortly after the controversy erupted.) I'm not really sure why Limbaugh's defenders launched this war on comedians. Limbaugh does not even consider himself a comedian; instead, he's referred to as an ""entertainer,"" which is the same label often used to describe strippers. (No offense intended to strippers.) In any event, Maher and C.K. were under attack for having crossed the line that comedians are forbidden to transgress. So, here is the big question: What exactly is the line that comedians are prohibited from breaching? What type of joke crosses from killing the crowd to killing your career? To me, the answer depends on two factors. Are you a famous comedian? And what type of joke is it? If you're not a famous comic, you can get away with saying almost anything. I perform regularly in the comedy clubs in New York City which feature -- in my opinion -- the top comedians in the nation. But still, night after night you will hear material far worse than anything Maher, C.K. or even ""the entertainer"" Limbaugh would have articulated. There's no shortage of jokes that are anti-everyone, including anti-women, anti-gay, anti-minority, anti-overweight people, etc. In a comedy club setting, it's very easy as a comedian to determine if you went too far. The audience stops laughing, or at least the laughs drop off considerably. The comic then moves on to the next joke and that is the end of it. On the other hand, if you're a famous comedian, it's a completely different story. If you tell an anti-""fill in the blank"" joke, you might find yourself on TMZ, hiring a team of publicists, and making the rounds on television shows offering your ""sincerest apologies."" Opinion: Democrats should reject Bill Maher's money . But to me, the more important factor in determining if a comedian -- famous or not -- has crossed the line of decency is to look at the subject matter of the joke. While I absolutely support freedom of speech, comedians deserve to suffer consequences if they make hateful jokes about race, ethnicity, gender, religion or sexual orientation. However, comedians must be afforded great leeway when the joke is about a political issue. Lampooning people in power like our president, Congress and political candidates is nearly a cornerstone to our democracy. Even our libel laws provide a higher degree of protection for private citizens than for public figures. American comedians have a proud tradition of raising awareness on important political and social issues. Richard Pryor, Lenny Bruce, George Carlin, Chris Rock and, of course, Jon Stewart, do more than simply make people laugh -- their comedy can shape public opinion. The standard for acceptable political comedy cannot be whether the joke offended someone. Political jokes will always offend someone since they are inherently divisive. The reason we tell these jokes is not only to get a laugh, but also to challenge people's views. (Here's a little secret: We comedians enjoy the fact we sometimes rankle those in the audience who disagree with our political jokes.) Political comedians must be afforded the unfettered right to satirize our politicians -- even if their jokes include crude words such as the ones that Maher and C.K. used about Sarah Palin, who is still considered a leader in the Republican Party even if she is no longer the governor of Alaska. If we stifle political comedy, we will cause a chilling effect on the free exchange of ideas on political issues. We will not only have lost the war on comedy, but also effectively silenced comedians from telling jokes about any controversial political topics or figures. This would result in two equally dire scenarios for our nation: Less freedom of expression and more prop comedy. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Dean Obeidallah.","Dean Obeidallah: A new war has broken out -- a war on comedy .

"(CNN) -- Rocker Ted Nugent found himself being investigated by the U.S. Secret Service after making this statement last weekend at the NRA Convention: ""If Barack Obama becomes the president in November, I will either be dead or in jail by this time next year."" While I dismissed Nugent's comments as just another idiotic statement by the person known as ""The Motor City Madman,"" others thought Nugent may have violated the federal law that makes it a crime to threaten the president of the United States. CNN contributor LZ Granderson even wrote an article entitled ""Ted Nugent should be in jail,"" calling for the arrest of Nugent. However, Granderson recognized that under the law as it stands, Nugent would not, in fact, be imprisoned for the comment at issue. Threats against the president of the United States should not be tolerated, regardless of the president's political affiliation. But while viscerally I may agree with those calling for Nugent's arrest, they are absolutely and unequivocally wrong. (In full disclosure, I must reveal that I do have Ted Nugent's classic hit ""Cat Scratch Fever"" in my IPod, but I still feel I can be objective in this matter.) Nugent should not be prosecuted for two equally important reasons: He did not break the law, and we must be vigilant in protecting freedom of expression when it involves political subject matter. From a legal point of view, Nugent's statement did not violate the controlling federal statute which provides that it's a crime to make: ""any threat to take the life of, to kidnap, or to inflict bodily harm upon the President of the United States."" To violate this statute, a person must make a ""true threat"" as defined by the federal courts. However, Nugent's words were ambiguous and did not objectively indicate a threat against the president. There's little doubt Nugent's statement would be considered by the courts as nothing more than ""political hyperbole,"" not a crime. Furthermore, when considering this federal statute, our courts have been more protective of statements made at a political rally. Nugent's comment was made at a political event -- the NRA convention, which parenthetically I must note was held in St. Louis, the city with the second highest rate of teens being killed by guns. The Secret Service met with Nugent on Thursday before his concert in Oklahoma, and based on their discussions came to the same conclusion. They did not arrest him and announced the matter was resolved. After the meeting, Nugent even praised the Secret Service agents with his statement: ""God bless the good federal agents wherever they may be."" (Although if you think about his statement -- ""wherever they may be"" - he may have actually been mocking the agents he had just met.) In any event, Nugent was free to play his concert that night and treat the audience to his greatest hit -- or maybe he has two -- I'm only aware of the one song in my IPod. Not only was the Secret Service's decision legally sound, it was also absolutely needed to ensure we have open and candid discussion about our elected officials, even when the comments are as asinine as Nugent's. Our courts have uniformly held that no form of speech is entitled to greater constitutional protection than political speech. The U.S. Supreme Court offered these instructive words in 1969, which courts have been employing ever since: ""Debate on public issues should be uninhibited, robust, and wide-open, and that it may well include vehement, caustic, and sometimes unpleasantly sharp attacks on government and public officials."" While the words Nugent used regrettably contribute to the growing lack of civility in American political discourse, it was still political speech. It is for the good of our democracy that the Ted Nugents of the world -- and I truly hope there is only one -- can make even ugly and caustic statements about the president without fear of imprisonment. Anything else could lead to a chilling effect on free expression which we cannot and should not allow. (Editor's note: An earlier version of this article contained a statistic which the Secret Service has denied: a statement that threats against President Obama have jumped 400% from those made against President George W. Bush. The Secret Service said that is not correct.)

"(CNN) -- A reporter from a right-wing media outlet heckled President Obama -- not once, but twice -- on Friday as he was unveiling a new immigration policy. If this shocks you, you haven't been paying attention. This is simply the latest page from the right's playbook to delegitimize Barack Obama's presidency. Some may dismiss it as an isolated incident, but it's not. It goes much deeper. Believe me, I know hecklers -- I'm a stand-up comedian. If someone heckles me once, it can be a mistake: too many drinks, overcome by emotion, etc. But when you heckle twice, you have an agenda. Neil Munro, the Irish born reporter who heckled President Obama, was not just from some random publication. He works for The Daily Caller, a right-wing website whose editor-in-chief is the bow-tie wearing Tucker Carlson. (You may recall Carlson as the guy who famously sparred with â€” and was taken down by -- Jon Stewart on CNN years ago.) Munro's first heckle occurred while President Obama was in midsentence, with Munro yelling out: ""Why do you favor foreigners over Americans?"" Obama responded: ""Excuse me, sir, but it's not time for questions."" Munro countered: ""Are you going to take questions?"" To which the president answered: ""Not while I'm speaking."" Later, Munro again interrupted the president in midstatement. Obama kept his cool; he simply finished his statement. If I had been president, I would have deported Munro back to his country of origin. A quick perusal of Munro's Twitter feed reveals he does not hide his contempt for President Obama. His tweets range from claims that Obama is using NASCAR and country music to attract ""white non-college voters,"" to slams of Michelle Obama, to allegations that Obama is racially discriminating against blacks in his White House hiring practices. But this is all not about Munro -- he is just a small cog in the right's campaign to diminish the legitimacy of Obama's presidency. I'm not talking about people disagreeing with policies. I mean specifically the campaign to paint Barack Obama as less than American -- as an ""other""--as someone whose presidency is not entitled to the same respect as that of the presidents who came before him. This crusade began in the days before Barack Obama was even sworn in as president. Back then, Rush Limbaugh, the radio host and self-described ""entertainer,"" announced on his show that he hoped Obama would fail as president. Obama had not even made his first decision as president. The campaign has continued with the right's birther movement contending that Obama was not born in the United States and hence should not be president. Some, like evangelical leader Franklin Graham, have suggested that Obama is a Muslim (he is a Christian), which to many on the right would mean he's not a ""real"" American. We have seen Republican Rep. Joe Wilson yell out at President Obama, ""You lie"" while Obama addressed a joint session of Congress in 2009. Can anyone remember the last time a U.S. president was called a liar in a joint session of Congress? I can't. Then there was Republican Rep. Joe Walsh, who last July called on President Obama to ""quit lying"" in regards to the debt ceiling debate. Can anyone remember something like this with previous presidents? I can't either. And, of course, there's Donald Trump, not only periodically renewing the ""birther"" fabrication, but also demanding to see President Obama's college grades, implying he doesn't think Obama is intellectually qualified to be president. So you see, Munro is just doing his tiny part. And no doubt some on the right will exalt him for his ""courage."" His boss, Tucker Carlson, defended him by saying that no one was upset when then-ABC reporter Sam Donaldson heckled President Reagan. But Fox News' Chris Wallace recalled today that when he was a White House correspondent with Donaldson during the Reagan administration, no one ever heckled the president. So, yet another lie. But the truth doesn't matter to the far right. It's not about policy or what is good for the United States of America. It's about delegitimizing President Obama for political gain. In the coming months, as we get closer to Election Day, you may see many more of these kinds of attacks. While they may disgust you, they should never surprise you. It's all in the playbook. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Dean Obeidallah.","Dean Obeidallah: A reporter from right-wing site heckled Obama as he talked about immigration .

"(CNN) -- The publicity whores are back. OK, they never really leave. We are able to avoid hearing from them for periods of time, but unfortunately, they always reappear -- typically when they have a book to sell or a new TV show to kick off or maybe when they feel ignored. This week, a handful of them crawled out from their subterranean colony. I won't even identify these Kings and Queens of Whoredom by name. They don't deserve the attention. But we are all painfully familiar with them. They are a modern-day Legion of Doom. Their primary purpose is to elevate their own power or glory without regard to truth, justice or the American way. Why can't we simply ignore them? Why can't we turn the other cheek and move on? These people are like rashes: The more you scratch them, the worse they get. But when you ignore a rash, it usually goes away. Do we really need to hear another ridiculous or dumb comment from them? Such as the millionaire with the grotesquely inflated ego and the equally grotesque hairstyle that looks as if a Pomeranian has been stapled to his scalp, the one who offered $5 million to see President Obama's college transcript. Or the former governor who was once stumped by the question ""What newspapers and magazines did you regularly read?"" There's also the smug comedian/host of a weekly cable talk show who has called the above publicity-driven politician vile names, including the ""C-word,"" maybe as an effort to keep himself in the news. And, of course, who can forget the radio talk show host who infamously stated in the days before Barack Obama was sworn in as our president: ""I hope he fails."" Plus, there's a B team of media bloodsuckers who are just about personal profit at any cost. In fact, one of the stars of this bush-league team publicly used the word ""retard"" twice this week to describe Obama. Why use that word? Perhaps it's because, as of the writing of this article, her new book is floundering at No. 199 on Amazon.com's sales list. Opinion: Sununu's comment insults black Americans . In contrast, the statements made by people in power -- or those seeking power -- about their political stances can't be ignored, even if they sound as extreme as the publicity whores. A recent example is when Republican U.S. Senate candidate Richard Mourdock stated, ""Even when life begins in that horrible situation of rape, that it is something that God intended to happen."" These words were not said by Mourdock in the hopes of personal profit or to inflame passions like those desperate for publicity. Rather, they offer a glimpse into his true feelings on the issue of rape and abortion. The media should cover this extensively so as to better inform voters. But too often, the media tend to follow big personalities who seek the spotlight. These publicity-seekers are like vampires who, instead of needing blood, must get attention to survive. It's in their DNA. They will still subject someone to their stream of nonsense. It could be an unlucky person on line behind them at Starbucks, an unsuspecting taxi driver or anyone who stops for a few seconds to tie their sneakers on the sidewalk. Next time we hear these people spew their vile garbage, let's collectively ignore them. Let's not become outraged or demand apologies. Let's go on with our business, and maybe -- just maybe -- the media will follow suit. Recently, I noticed a scab covering a small cut on my hand. When I picked at it, it became bigger and took up more of my attention. But when I left it alone, it healed. It disappeared without a trace. Let's hope the same happens with the publicity whores.

"(CNN) -- A court in Fulton County, Georgia, has temporarily stopped the scheduled Monday night execution of condemned murderer Warren Hill. Hill was sentenced to death for the 1990 killing of Joseph Handspike, another inmate in a Georgia state prison. He was convicted of beating Handspike to death with a nail-studded board while serving a life sentence in the 1985 killing of his girlfriend, Myra Wright. His lawyers have argued that Hill is mentally retarded. Last minute stay of execution granted in February . ""Today, the Court found that more time is needed to explore Mr. Hill's complaint, which raises serious concerns about the extreme secrecy surrounding the execution process in Georgia, and the new Lethal Injection Secrecy Act, which took effect one day before Georgia issued a death warrant for Mr. Hill,"" Brian Kammer, Hill's attorney said in a statement. Monday is not the first time Hill's execution has been halted. He had previously been scheduled to die last July, but the state Supreme Court stopped the execution on procedural grounds. Hill was granted another stay in February. According to Kammer, a briefing on Hill's complaint will take place Thursday. A new execution date is expected to be set for the same day, he said. ""Ultimately, we are hopeful that the United States Supreme Court will hear Mr. Hill's pending Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus, and will have the opportunity to consider the important new evidence in this case, that there is unanimous consensus among all the doctors who have examined Mr. Hill, including three who previously testified for the state, that he is a person with mental retardation, and thus ineligible for the death penalty,"" said Kammer. Hill's lawyers say his low IQ means he should be spared under a 2002 decision that barred the execution of the mentally disabled.

"New York (CNN) -- ""Is capitalism really about the ability of a handful of rich people to manipulate the lives of thousands of people and then walk off with the money?"" ""The 1% is doing fine. I want to help the 99%."" The above statements are the type you might expect to hear at an Occupy Wall Street protest. But they weren't uttered there. Instead, the first was from Newt Gingrich and the second was from Mitt Romney. We now have a war of words launched at the 1% by the 1% -- or in the case of Mitt Romney, the .01%. These type of populist attacks escalated in the last few days as Gingrich criticized Romney for living ""in a world of Swiss bank accounts and Cayman Island accounts"" and for earning ""$20 million a year income with no work."" What's going on here?! Have we been transported to some ""Bizarro World"" where everything is backward? Since when does the Republican Party care about income equality? The answer is simple: These issues are now resonating with voters. More than 60% of voters support policies addressing income inequality. Indeed, an even higher number support raising taxes on the wealthiest Americans. In 1992, Bill Clinton's then-campaign manager, James Carville, famously hung a sign in the campaign office to remind Clinton to focus on the most pressing issue of that presidential race: ""It's the economy, stupid."" Today, that sign would be updated to read: ""It's the income inequality, stupid."" Over the last 10 years, American families have become poorer with the median household income dropping by 7%. Some have termed this a ""Lost Decade"" as prices have risen, but our buying power has shrunk. And just as alarming, the number of Americans living in poverty has risen to more than 46 million people, its highest rate since 1993. At the same time, the rich have become richer. A recent study found the income of the top 1% of Americans almost tripled from 1979 to 2007, increasing by 275%. This means the gap between the wealthy and the rest of us in America is growing. The only time in America's history that we have witnessed this type of chasm between the wealthy and poor was shortly before the Great Depression. But as former Labor Secretary Robert Reich detailed in his book ""Aftershock,"" economic growth can only be sustained for prolonged periods of time when the gap between the rich and poor is narrowed. As Reich notes, the top 1% -- no matter how wealthy they become -- cannot alone fuel our consumer-driven economy. Only a vibrant middle class can accomplish that. If we continue down this path of greater income inequality, I fear the unthinkable could occur: the death of the American dream. ""The American dream"" -- at least to me -- is that each generation has the opportunity to live a better life than the one before. Thankfully, we have not been a nation shackled with a socioeconomic caste system. Instead, America has offered the prospect of economic mobility. It is this promise that has inspired Americans to dream big. The American dream has also inspired millions to immigrate to this nation. My Palestinian father and Sicilian grandparents crossed many oceans to live in a country that offered them opportunity. They both were born in places where if you weren't rich by birth, your prospects for climbing the social ladder were low -- indeed, it would have been cruel even to harbor such dreams since there was almost no chance of realizing them. But America offered them a place to dream. Years ago I heard U2's Bono sum up the difference between the United States and other nations when it came to economic opportunity. His quote has stayed with me ever since: ""In the United States, you look at the guy that lives in the mansion on the hill, and you think, you know, one day, if I work really hard, I could live in that mansion. In Ireland, people look up at the guy in the mansion on the hill and go, 'One day, I'm going to get that bastard.' "" Will we become a nation where our destiny is no longer based on our actions, but on the happenstance of the economic tier we are born into? A nation where we view the wealthy with contempt? The wealthy paying their fair share of taxes should not be a partisan issue. History has shown that policies to promote greater income equality are good for all Americans both economically and because they preserve the American dream that the rich, the poor -- and everyone in between -- can not only dream but can also achieve a better life for themselves and their family.

"(CNN) -- Poor Rick Santorum. He is very frustrated and apparently now a bit nauseous. The ""liberal elite"" media are getting under his skin with their incessant questions about his views on social issues such as same-sex marriage, abortion and birth control. (Santorum's opposition to birth control seems a bit disingenuous since he loves to wear a sweater vest -- which I view as a form of birth control.) This frustration was bad enough, but his emotional state recently took a turn for the worse. On Sunday, Santorum reiterated that he ""almost threw up"" after reading John F. Kennedy's famous 1960 speech that declared a president's religious views were private and should not be ""imposed by him upon the nation."" It appears that Santorum is an irritated, woozy wreck of a presidential candidate. Maybe that is why this week he requested Secret Service protection. (My question is: Who is going to protect us from Santorum?) The joking and nausea aside, I can't comprehend how Santorum could be distraught when the media inquire about topics he raised? Is he confused about how this whole running for president thing works? Or does he not understand the words coming out of his mouth? Santorum was so distressed by the ""liberal"" media that he took off time from campaigning last week in Michigan and Arizona and headed to Dallas seeking refuge with the least liberal elitist media person he could find: Glenn Beck. There, Beck and Santorum sat on couches directly across from each other, making it look less like a political interview and more like a session with ""Dr. Phil."" It wasn't long before Santorum opened up to ""Dr. Glenn"" about his feelings regarding the ""bad"" media: ""They ask the question, 'Why are you always talking about contraception?' I said, 'Because that's all you want to ask me about.' I mean, it is frustrating. ... You can get a little frustrated."" I was hoping Beck would offer Santorum one of Dr. Phil's famed lines of advice such as: ""No dog ever peed on a moving car."" Despite all Santorum's talk that our nation's and God's laws must agree and that biblical truths are the basis for his views on social issues such as same-sex marriage, he assured us during last week's CNN debate in Arizona that he does not intend to transform his religious beliefs into public policy: ""Just because I'm talking about it doesn't mean I want a government program to fix it."" Sorry, you can't have it both ways. You can't try to win conservative voters by telling them that the Bible -- not our Constitution -- is the standard our laws must agree with and then try to assure mainstream Americans that you don't mean it. In the words of Dr. Phil: ""That dog don't hunt."" Santorum needs to come clean with the American people. Is his allegiance to the Bible or the Constitution? Will he publicly recognize there is a separation of church and state in America? Does he believe the United States does not have an official religion? Kennedy -- a Roman Catholic like Santorum -- was dogged by these same issues when he was running for president. Kennedy addressed this matter head-on in that 1960 speech to a group of Protestant ministers: ""I am the Democratic Party's candidate for president who happens also to be a Catholic. ... I believe in an America where the separation of church and state is absolute."" To say Rick Santorum is no John Kennedy is too easy. It's like comparing Justin Bieber to the Beatles. But Santorum has a chance to follow Kennedy's example despite his feeling that the 35th president's sentiments in that speech almost made him want to ""throw up."" To be honest, however, even if Santorum would make such a speech, it would be more challenging for him to put this issue behind him than it was for Kennedy. After all, it was not Kennedy who raised these issues but his opponents, who claimed that he would be more loyal to the pope and Catholic law than the Constitution. In contrast, Santorum intentionally made these subjects a central theme in his campaign, often sounding less like a person running to be the leader of a democratic nation and more like someone seeking the position of pastor or the leader of a province in Afghanistan. I believe most Americans -- including myself -- suspect that a president's faith could color his decisions on some level.Â But I hope that most Americans would, too, agree that a president's religious beliefs should be subservient to our Constitution. Even Ronald Reagan stated clearly that: ""Church and state are, and must remain, separate."" We now need to hear that from Santorum. The opinions in this commentary are solely those of Dean Obeidallah.","Dean Obeidallah: Rick Santorum annoyed the media ask for his stance on social issues .

"(CNN) -- The news that NBC plans to dump Jay Leno -- again -- lifts the curtain on a dark corner of the media business. Is it the fact that a network could be thickheaded enough to call the same play that blew up last time with the Conan O'Brien debacle? Nah. That's pretty obvious. It's the way that television critics despise Leno, and how that colors the coverage of the late-night wars. When The New York Times' Bill Carter broke the story last week that NBC is ready to hand ""The Tonight Show"" to Jimmy Fallon in 2014, there was this line buried deep in the piece: ""Another complicating factor has been Mr. Leno's success in the ratings."" Let's ponder that for a moment. Leno has the top-rated show at 11:30. NBC executives are nonetheless planning on booting him when his contract expires in the fall of 2014 and moving the show from Burbank, California, to New York. Watch: Daily Caller editor created fake Facebook identity . Imagine how that story line would play out if critics and reporters viewed Leno as sympathetically as they do, say, Fallon or Leno's ABC rival, Jimmy Kimmel. What?? NBC is kicking Jay to the curb? The guy who has made the network hundreds of millions of dollars over the last two decades? The man who bounced back from his last firing and regained the late-night throne? What did he do to deserve this? Instead the media reaction is a collective shrug of the shoulders: Yeah, makes sense. Time to wheel the old guy off the stage. Jay hasn't been funny since the Clinton administration and Fallon appeals to a younger crowd. Watch: Do the critics want Jay Leno booted off the stage? Time's James Poniewozik writes that ""Jay 'It's just a business' Leno deserves no man's pity however this plays out."" The Atlantic complains about his ""groan-worthy jokes."" But here's the thing: Leno doesn't appeal to anyone but the viewers. At least those who live west of the Hudson River and east of the Santa Monica Mountains. He does broad comedy and hardly wields the kind of cutting-edge style favored by the bicoastal elites. But much of America likes him. Does the 62-year-old comic skew old? Well, he's been beating Kimmel and David Letterman even in the coveted 18-to-49 demo. Watch: Is the press now forgetting the horror of Newtown? The critics made the same mistake last time around. Conan was so much funnier than Jay that giving him ""Tonight"" rather than risking his departure was a brilliant move by NBC. Except that O'Brien's quirky humor appealed to a narrow slice of the audience, the ratings plummeted, and a $32 million payout later, he was gone and Leno was back. Leno has been punching back in his monologue, likening NBC suits to ""snakes"" and saying that the network's motto is ""The Biggest Loser."" The Times reports that a top executive ordered Leno to stop mocking the network, a ham-handed attempt at censorship that has obviously failed. One strange twist is that some conservative pundits are carping that NBC is ousting Leno because of his jokes about President Obama (he ribs every president) and because, unlike the more openly liberal Letterman, he appeals to the heartland. It's obviously more of a dollars-and-cents gamble that Fallon is the future. And indeed, Jimmy Fallon makes sense as Leno's eventual heir. Watch: Is there a double standard in gay marriage coverage? But in their haste, NBC execs risk blowing up the situation the way they did in hustling Ann Curry off the ""Today"" show, sparking a backlash against Matt Lauer and sending what had been the iconic morning show plunging into second place. Their prime-time lineup is in fifth place. Do they really need to immolate one of the few time periods where the network is No. 1? Fallon's a young guy. Johnny Carson was 66 when he stepped down. What's the rush? The critics, of course, won't be happy until Leno is working the comedy clubs where he spends his vacations (and possibly competing against NBC from Fox). And they are entitled to their views of who has comedic chops and who is out of gas. But in this case, they're out of touch with the people who vote with their remote controls.","Howard Kurtz: NBC's plan to replace Jay Leno sits well with critics .
He says Leno's brand of comedy appeals to much of America .
Critics are free to prefer Fallon, Kimmel, but replacing Leno is risky, he says ."
"(CNN) -- Fact: Americans love to curse. We, the people, use profanity every day. Some will deny this reality, but those people are [expletive] kidding themselves. Cursing is in our movies, TV shows, books and magazines. It's also a big part of our daily conversations -- especially when we get passionate about something. However, for some bizarre reason, we demand that our elected officials not speak like the rest of us. We condemn them for even the slightest bit of swearing in public. Opinion: Ban swearing? No way! For example, about a week ago, House Speaker John Boehner was rebuked for using these words when speaking to Republican House members: ""Let's call bulls--- bulls---"" President Obama raised more than a few eyebrows when he stated in a 2010 television interview that he wanted to know ""whose ass to kick"" to get the cleanup of the BP oil spill moving faster. And Vice President Joe Biden came under fire for saying to President Obama during the signing ceremony of the health care law: ""This is a big f---- deal!"" We need to stop being so hypocritical in holding our politicians to a ridiculously prudish standard of communication. If we get worked up about an issue, we wouldn't just use the King's English to explain how we really feel -- we'd be adding some French. But we have neutered our politicians' intensity and passion by limiting their choice of words. And then we wonder why so many of our elected officials -- and especially our presidential candidates -- seem so bland and hard to relate to. I'm not saying elected officials should be dropping the ""f-bomb"" when talking to schoolchildren, but why not allow them to show more emotions? Even CEO recruiters now recognize that the use of profanity by corporate executives is acceptable because it is a mark of ""authenticity"" and ""commitment."" Hence, I offer a proposal that will hopefully provide us a glimpse of our presidential candidates at their most raw: A debate between President Obama and Mitt Romney on HBO so that they can use all the profanity they feel is necessary to convey their views. This debate format benefits both voters and the candidates. For voters, it will enable us to truly assess a candidate's commitment to an issue. Let's be brutally honest, what showcases more sincerity? ""Read my lips, no new taxes,"" or, ""Read my lips, no [expletive] taxes. I'm not [expletive] kidding!"" Plus we can see how our presidential candidates would respond to a barrage of criticism, which is a test of character. How would Romney respond to President Obama calling him: ""The biggest [expletive] flip-flopper in political history?"" Would Romney just stand there, smiling sheepishly, or would he respond by channeling Samuel L. Jackson and calling Obama: ""The worst [expletive] president in American [expletive] history!"" The two candidates should support this proposed debate since it will give them a much needed chance to show Americans their unfiltered, human side -- something both Obama and Romney clearly need to work on. I understand that some people object vehemently to any kind of vulgarity. Indeed, just this Monday, residents in Middleborough, Massachusetts, voted to issue a $20 fine to anyone who curses in public. And earlier this year, the City Council in Washington voted to ban council members from using dirty words in public meetings. To those who think profanity undermines the decorum of the presidency, you may have missed the details in your college history class. Numerous presidents on both sides of the political aisle have been famous for their use of foul language, including Harry Truman, John F. Kennedy, Lyndon Johnson, George W. Bush, Bill Clinton and the king of cursing: Richard Nixon. (At least on his private White House tapes.) I'm not suggesting that using cuss words at a presidential debate will help end our nation's problems. But it might allow us to see our candidates at their most authentic self. And it will get us more interested and engaged in our democratic process. Plus it will probably be the highest rated and the most quoted presidential debate in the history of our country.

"(CNN) -- Seven members of Mexico's Zetas cartel were arrested Tuesday after a U.S. indictment accused a total of 14 cartel members of laundering drug money through the breeding and racing of American quarter horses in the United States, authorities said. Los Zetas leader Miguel Angel Trevino Morales, 38, and his two brothers were named in the federal indictment, and brother Jose Trevino Morales, 45, and his wife, 38-year-old Zulema Trevino, were among the seven arrested, federal authorities said. The 14 defendants were charged with a conspiracy using horse racing and breeding to launder the cartel's drug money, authorities said. ""The allegations in this indictment, if proven, would document yet another example of the corrupting influence of Mexican drug cartels within the United States, facilitated by the enormous profits generated by the illicit drug trade,"" U.S. Attorney Robert Pitman of the Western District of Texas said in a statement. Opinion: Illicit funds from Mexico find haven in U.S. Since 2008, cartel leader Miguel Angel Trevino Morales and brother Oscar Omar Trevino Morales directed millions of dollars in drug money to brother Jose and his wife for buying, training, breeding and racing quarter horses in New Mexico, Oklahoma, California and Texas, authorities said. Jose Trevino, his wife and others disguised the ownership of the horses through the use of ""front"" companies, authorities said. Among the horses that were part of the alleged laundering operations were Tempting Dash, winner of the Dash for Cash at Lone Star Park racetrack in Grand Prairie, Texas, on October 24, 2009, and Mr. Piloto, winner of the $1 million All American Futurity at Ruidoso Downs on Labor Day 2010 in Ruidoso, New Mexico, authorities said. Federal authorities are seeking forfeiture of those race horses and others named Dashin Follies, Coronita Cartel and Separate Fire -- as well as property in Lexington, Oklahoma, and Bastrop County, Texas, and money in three bank accounts, officials said. The indictment alleges the horse racing and breeding conspiracy raised $20 million, and authorities are seeking a monetary judgment in that amount, officials said. The Los Zetas cartel, headquartered in Nuevo Laredo, Mexico, directly across the border from Laredo, Texas, is Mexico's largest drug cartel in terms of territory and has operations in 11 Mexican states, the indictment said. The cartel sends thousands of kilograms of cocaine and other drugs annually to the United States, generating many millions of dollars, the indictment said. ""This case is a prime example of the ability of Mexican drug cartels to establish footholds in legitimate U.S. industries and highlights the serious threat money laundering causes to our financial system,"" Richard Weber, chief of IRS Criminal Investigation, said in a statement. The five other people arrested Tuesday are Fernando Solis Garcia, 29, in Ruidoso; 26-year-old Carlos Miguel Nayen Borbolla, 32-year-old Adan Farias and 28-year-old Felipe Alejandro Quintero in Los Angeles; and Eusevio Maldonado Huitron, 48, in Austin, Texas, authorities said. Cartel leader Miguel Angel Trevino Morales and brother Oscar Omar Trevino Morales, 36, are believed to be in Mexico, authorities said. The five others indicted who haven't been arrested as of Tuesday are Raul Ramirez, 20, of El Paso, Texas; Francisco Antonio Colorado Cessa, 51, of Veracruz, Mexico; Victor Manuel Lopez, 31, of Nuevo Laredo; and Sergio Rogelio Guerrero Rincon, 40, and Luis Gerardo Aguirre, 35, both of Mexico, authorities said.

"Jakarta, Indonesia (CNN) -- Indonesia is on high alert after police foiled terror plans to detonate bombs Friday near a church in a Jakarta suburb. The plan was to detonate the bombs by a timer, using a mobile phone, just before a scheduled Easter service at a Catholic church in Tangerang, authorities said. Police uncovered the plan after the arrests of 19 suspects over the past few days. The suspects were allegedly involved in the foiled attack near the Catholic church. Authorities found about 150 kilograms (330 pounds) of explosives near the church on Thursday, said Boy Rafli Amar, the national police spokesman. There were two large bombs and five smaller ones, he said. ""Starting tonight until the day after Easter, the military and the police will be on the highest alert at all places,"" said Joko Suyanto, the coordinating minster for security. Indonesia is a predominantly Muslim nation, but has other religious minorities such as Christians and Hindus. The government has been vigilant over the threat of sectarian violence. Security will be beefed up around houses of worship, tourist destinations, embassies and sites visited by foreigners, officials said. Police arrested the suspects in connection with the church bomb and/or attempted mail bomb attacks last month. The mail bombs were packed as fake books and sent to four targets, including a moderate Muslim scholar and a human rights activist, officials said. Two security officials and a police detective were injured while attempting to defuse one of the mail bombs, the police spokesman said. Indonesia has been on edge after last month's parcel bombs and the Friday suicide bombing in a mosque in Cirebon, West Java.","Authorities found about 150 kilograms (330 pounds) of explosives near a church .

"Johannesburg, South Africa (CNN) -- Nine mine employees were hurt Monday when Anglo American Platinum security guards shot rubber bullets to break up a confrontation between rival union groups at a mine in northwest South Africa, the company said in a statement. The incident occurred at the company's Siphumelele mine in the Rustenburg area and involved members of the Workers Committee and shop stewards for the National Union of Mineworkers. ""As they were attempting to evacuate the NUM shop stewards who were trapped in their offices, three security personnel sustained minor injuries during this incident,"" the statement said. All 12 injured employees received medical attention; none of the injuries was life-threatening, it added. Police spokesman Brig. Thulani Ngubane said those hurt were taken to Bleskop Hospital. The shootings did not involve police, he said. ""Workers committee members are contesting NUM's legitimacy at the mine and demanding that NUM vacate its offices,"" the company statement said. The company said it is trying to validate union membership at Rustenburg and the mines north of the Pilanesberg National Park. Anglo American Platinum Limited, a member of the Anglo American plc Group, describes itself as the world's leading primary producer of platinum group metals, accounting for 40% of the world's newly mined platinum. Its mining, smelting and refining operations are based in South Africa. Last fall, several major South African mining companies, including Anglo American, were involved in labor disputes with their miners that erupted in violence. In October, police repeatedly clashed with protesters near one of Anglo American's mines, and the company fired about 12,000 striking workers who refused to attend disciplinary hearings. The union did not immediately respond to a request for comment. CNN's Kim Norgaard reported on this story from Johannesburg, and Tom Watkins wrote it in Atlanta.","Nine employees were shot with rubber bullets, the company says .

"(CNN) -- What the title of J.K. Rowling's first adult novel, ""A Casual Vacancy,"" brings to mind is pleasure: that a writer with such standing (in certain circles) has the derring-do and moxie to turn her back on the audience that first brought her fame, some years ago, and meet them again, those same people. Only it's years later, and now they're grownups. Holding their own credit cards, at the ready for this new book. There is never a vacancy in the world of writers of books for the grownup market or the preteen mob. There is a surfeit of writers working hard, thanklessly. And when a John Updike or a Maurice Sendak dies, such quieter and under-appreciated writers note that geniuses leave a permanent loss, not a casual vacancy to be filled. So while I have not yet read Rowling's book. I admire that she has decided to try her hand at wooing world-weary grownups. She needn't have, of course. She could have stood and blown 100-pound notes (in British sterling) out her bagpipe in that castle in Scotland from now till her dying day and never noticed the difference. She must be writing because she needs to write. Now, truth to tell, it's far more common in the UK for writers to shift audiences, adults to children or vice versa. Graham Greene wrote a few picture books. Salman Rushdie has written fantasies for children. C.S. Lewis was a scholar and popular theologian long before he mapped out Narnia and Tolkien, famously, a philologist and medievalist before he discovered the common hobbit. J.K. Rowling shows why muggles obsessed with class . But in the U.S., writers for children tend to do little else. When someone not primarily driven to write for children does venture into the field from the great beyond, he or she is usually slumming, dallying from the field of entertainment or sometimes politics, which is another kind of entertainment, just less funny. Most often, these books aren't very good. In the U.S., adults who begin writing for children and then turn to writing for adults -- successfully -- are few and far between. (I am one of them; I think that because ""Wicked"" was based on a children's classic, it allowed me to slip the ropes of convention.) Such a conversion to being a writer for adults after a novitiate as a writer for children is more common in England. Think of Penelope Lively, who first won the Carnegie Medal for a children's book and a few years later was shortlisted for the Booker Prize for an adult novel. Think Jane Gardam, Jill Paton Walsh. They move back and forth between the audiences with ease. There's no reason to think J.K. Rowling can't do the same. By and large, the British don't sentimentalize childhood the way Americans tend to -- at least, not since the Blitz brought an end to Peter Pan and Mary Poppins and other British nationals who no longer could fly over central London with impunity and song. So Rowling, from a tradition of starch and stiff-upper-lip, should have every advantage. England made her keen, and the world made her rich. She's too smart to be self-adoring or self-indulgent, so she won't fall into that trap. We'll find out soon enough whether her new effort will be a memorable book -- but it won't be a weak one, I bet, for it's been prompted by nothing more urgent than a need to write or die. J.K. Rowling's 'The Casual Vacancy' -- snobbery, sex and scheming . Final thought, though: No one who really gets the density and elegance and mystery of childhood is unprepared to write for adults. By comparison, the adult audience is easier to satisfy than the child audience. Adults have picked up the habit of patience. They understand the concept of delayed gratification and so can be tricked into investment in page after page, waiting for the payoff. For their part, children are by nature fickle, distractible, alert, compulsive. If they aren't wooed and won early on, they toss the book Grandma gave them right into the rubbish bin and sally out the door. Writing for children -- succeeding at writing for children -- is much harder than writing for adults, and an excellent internship besides. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Gregory Maguire.","Gregory Maguire: J.K. Rowling has moxie, derring-do to reunite with her readers as adults .
He says she doesn't need the money, she's written her new novel out of a need to write .
Toggling between adult and youth writing more common in UK, less so in U.S., he says .

"(Health.com) -- State laws that place restrictions on teenage drivers and require them to ""graduate"" from an intermediate license to a full license do seem to prevent fatal crashes involving teens, but only among the youngest drivers. A new analysis of national crash data published this week in the Journal of the American Medical Association found that between 1986 and 2007, the rate of fatal accidents involving 16-year-old drivers was 26% lower in states that prohibited teens from driving at night and carrying certain passengers, compared to states with neither restriction. Among 18-year-olds, however, strong graduated driver licensing (GDL) programs were associated with a 12% increase in the fatal crash rate, which effectively cancelled out the benefits among younger drivers. When teen drivers of all ages were pooled together, the link between these programs and the rate of fatal crashes was statistically negligible. Health.com: Your car made healthy . ""Right now, we're not getting the net effect across all teens that we're hoping for,"" says Scott V. Masten, Ph.D., the lead author of the study and a researcher at the California Department of Motor Vehicles, in Sacramento. ""We're getting this washout where we do save some lives overall, but not nearly what we thought it [would be]."" Since the first GDL programs were established in 1996, there have been 1,348 fewer fatal crashes involving 16-year-old drivers and 1,086 more involving 18-year-olds, according to the study. Masten and his colleagues can't explain the increase in traffic deaths among 18-year-olds, but they suggest that it may be a form of ""payback"" for the restrictions on younger drivers. By limiting teen driving, they explain, graduated-license laws may deprive younger teens of valuable driving experience, and in some cases may lead teens to delay getting a license altogether. ""They're saying, 'Forget it. I'll wait till I'm 18,'"" Masten says. ""We have, at least in California, more novice 18- and 19-year-olds with no driving experience."" Health.com: 7 ways to drive like a pro . GDL programs are now in place in one form or another in all 50 states plus the District of Columbia. Every state requires would-be teen drivers to first get a learner's permit, during which they can drive only with a parent or other adult, but beyond that the strength of the programs varies. For the purposes of the study, Masten and his colleagues considered GDL programs that prohibit teens from driving after 1 a.m. and carrying certain passengers to be ""stronger,"" while they considered programs with just one of those restrictions to be ""weaker."" The pattern of fatal crashes associated with weaker GDL programs was similar, though less pronounced, than the pattern seen with stronger programs. In states with weaker programs, fatal crash rates were 16% lower among 16-year-olds and 10% higher among 18-year-olds than in states with neither of the two key restrictions. Health.com: Your emergency car kit . ""The expectation was that older [teen] drivers wouldn't be affected much one way or the other, so this is a new thing to think about,"" says Anne McCartt, Ph.D., senior vice president for research at the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, an Arlington, Va.-based nonprofit organization dedicated to reducing traffic deaths and accidents. But McCartt, who coauthored an editorial accompanying the new study, says this and other research suggests that GDL programs do help protect younger teen drivers. Although ""the evidence is mixed at this point about how GDL affects older teens,"" she says, ""I don't think there's any study that hasn't found a large benefit for 16-year-olds."" Health.com: How to be safe -- not sorry -- behind the wheel . The study had some important limitations that will need to be addressed in future research. For one, the authors looked only at fatal accidents, which account for a small percentage of all crashes and aren't representative of accidents as a whole. (Alcohol and speeding are more often a factor in fatal crashes, for example.) Masten and his colleagues also suggest that the findings from their nationwide analysis don't necessarily reflect the effectiveness of specific GDL programs, given the variety in state laws. The age restrictions surrounding graduated licenses differ between states, Masten notes, as do the laws concerning learner's permits, passengers, and nighttime driving.

"London (CNN) -- Harry Potter author J.K. Rowling's first adult novel went on sale amid a buzz of anticipation Thursday -- but reviews suggest those hoping for a repeat of the charms and wizardry of the Hogwarts books may be disappointed. ""The Casual Vacancy"" is firmly aimed at those in the grown-up world, with the writer's pen dissecting social inequality, small-town politics and snobbery -- with sex, abuse and a mouthful of swearing thrown in for good measure. Muggle moms await J.K. Rowling's first adult book . Set in the fictional town of Pagford, in western England, it centers on a local election following the death of a parish councilman -- and relies on what reviewers agree is a cast of finely drawn but generally unpleasant characters to bring this insular world to life. ""We are firmly in Muggle-land -- about as far from the enchanted world of Harry Potter as we can get,"" wrote Michiko Kakutani in The New York Times. ""There is no magic in this book -- in terms of wizarding or in terms of narrative sorcery. Instead, this novel for adults is filled with a variety of people like Harry's aunt and uncle, Petunia and Vernon Dursley: self-absorbed, small-minded, snobbish and judgmental folks, whose stories neither engage nor transport us."" The Guardian newspaper's Theo Tait judges it ""a solid, traditional and determinedly unadventurous English novel"" but praises Rowling's depiction of the ""claustrophobic horror"" of a small-town community, with plenty of scheming and ""everyone knowing everyone."" Sales of the book, which was released in paper, online and e-book form in Britain and the United States on Thursday morning, will no doubt be closely watched. But while Rowling's publisher, Little Brown, and booksellers seem confident the tome will prove a bestseller, the mad rush and predawn lines that awaited some of the Potter releases were not in evidence. Early sales seemed slow at a central London branch of the Waterstone's bookstore chain, where stacks of the hardback novel, with its stridently red and yellow cover, were unwrapped and ready for buyers. Opinion: J.K. Rowling explains why muggles are obsessed with class . Waterstone's spokeswoman Debs Tilley said preorders had been ""fantastic,"" suggesting Rowling commands a legion of devoted readers willing to give her new venture a try, even if they're not beating down the doors to the store. ""Having known and loved her writing for the past 15 years, the world has been waiting to see what she did next,"" Tilley said. "" 'The Casual Vacancy' has reminded us all just how popular she is and how committed her fans are."" Store manager Lori Fazio of R.J. Julia Booksellers in Madison, Connecticut, told CNN that interest in the novel had been building for months, with lots of advance orders. ""People can't wait for this, for it to finally hit the bookstore,"" she said. While the book is certainly different from Rowling's previous works, Fazio predicts it will win fans if readers realize it's ""an extreme opposite from Harry Potter"" and go into it with an open mind. Harry Potter is certainly a tough act to follow. The seven-book series sold more than 450 million copies and spawned a multibillion-dollar film franchise. Details of the new book's content were kept largely under wraps ahead of its release, with Rowling speaking to only a few media outlets in the United Kingdom and the United States. Those critics lucky enough to get their hands on an advance copy also had to keep their reviews on hold until Thursday. But one young woman in London told CNN why she's looking forward to reading it. ""I think it will be really interesting to see how J.K. Rowling writes something else that isn't Harry Potter, that isn't aimed at children or young people,"" she said. ""I've heard lots about 'The Casual Vacancy' as being a political satire and more of that, so it's going to be nice to see if she pulls it off."" A representative for Little Brown said that presales of the novel had gone very well and that the idea behind the limited prepublication access to the book was to make it as ""normal"" a launch as possible. The first print run in the United States is 2 million copies, the publisher said. But with limited information leaked beforehand, many parents will probably be wondering Thursday if the book will appeal to -- or perhaps be suitable for -- children who have grown up loving Harry Potter's world of muggles and magic. Will J.K. Rowling net wizard profits from switch to crime? Kakutani of The New York Times is unequivocal in her judgment. ""This is definitely not a book for children: suicide, rape, heroin addiction, beatings and thoughts of patricide percolate through its pages; there is a sex scene set in a cemetery, a grotesque description of a used condom ... and alarming scenes of violent domestic abuse. ""The novel contains moments of genuine drama and flashes here and there of humor, but it ends on such a disheartening note with two more abrupt, crudely stage-managed deaths that the reader is left stumbling about with whatever is the opposite of the emotions evoked by the end of the Harry Potter series."" In Britain's The Daily Telegraph newspaper, reviewer Allison Pearson notes Rowling's use of humor -- but also paints a black image of the overall mood. ""The Casual Vacancy"" is ""sometimes funny, often startlingly well observed, and full of cruelty and despair. One teenager cuts herself to relieve her misery, another commits suicide. Online pornography is described in gynecological detail,"" she writes. ""It feels as if the author has unleashed all the swearing, sex and vitriol that have been off-limits to her since Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone was published in 1997. As for the ending, dear God, it is so howlingly bleak that it makes Thomas Hardy look like PG Wodehouse."" Other reviewers bandy about big literary names such as George Eliot, Jane Austen and Charles Dickens as they dissect Rowling's minute grasp of plot and characterization. The Financial Times calls it ""an old-fashioned novel, a thoughtful, angry and densely plotted story in the 19th-century tradition, set in a town in which class and racial divisions run deep."" Time magazine reviewer Lev Grossman finds much to enjoy in its pages, saying: ""What surprised me about 'The Casual Vacancy' was not just how good it was, but the way in which it was good. ""I suppose I'd expected a kind of aged-up, magicked-down Harry Potter. ... But 'The Casual Vacancy' is a different beast entirely. It was not what I was expecting. It's a big, ambitious, brilliant, profane, funny, deeply upsetting and magnificently eloquent novel of contemporary England."" But posing the question of whether it can ever live up to the hype, the Daily Mail's Jan Moir says no. ""Not unless you want to have more than 500 pages of relentless socialist manifesto masquerading as literature crammed down your throat,"" she writes. As for Rowling, she told the BBC that she had written the book by choice, rather than necessity, since the success of the Potter series has made her wealthy. ""I had nothing to prove. I don't mean that in an arrogant way. I can pay my bills every day, I am grateful for that fact. I don't need to publish,"" she said. But while the novel was born of an idea that excited her and is ""personal in the sense that it deals with broad themes that have affected my life in a very real sense -- poverty for example,"" Rowling thinks it likely her next book will be for children. For those yearning for a return to the more familiar territory of Hogwarts, however, the British author has little hope to offer. ""It was murder saying goodbye, but I truly -- where Harry's story is concerned, I'm done. Now if I had a fabulous idea, I would do it. But I've got to have a great idea.""

"(CNN) -- Sen. Barack Obama told CNN on Wednesday the recent uproar over his former pastor's sermons has reminded him of the odds he faces in winning the White House. Sen. Barack Obama opens up in a one-on-one exclusive interview with Anderson Cooper. ""In some ways, this controversy has actually shaken me up a little bit and gotten me back into remembering that the odds of me getting elected have always been lower than some of the other conventional candidates,"" the Illinois senator told CNN's Anderson Cooper in an exclusive one-on-one interview. Obama declined to speculate on whether the controversy surrounding the Rev. Jeremiah Wright's sermons may damage him politically, but said his campaign does best when it doesn't follow the ""textbook."" ""If I was just running the textbook campaign -- doing the conventional thing -- I probably wasn't going to win because Sen. [Hillary] Clinton was going to be much more capable of doing that than I would be,"" he said. ""We had tremendous success, and I think we were starting to get a little comfortable and conventional right before Texas and Ohio."" The exclusive interview came one day after Obama delivered a speech on race and politics in Philadelphia, during which he denounced some of Wright's comments, but said he could not repudiate the man himself. ""I can no more disown him than I can disown the black community. I can no more disown him than I can my white grandmother. These people are a part of me. And they are a part of America, this country that I love,"" Obama said in the speech. Asked why he didn't denounce the controversial comment when he first heard of them more than a year ago, Obama noted Wright was on the verge of retirement. ""I told him that I profoundly disagreed with his positions. As I said before, he was on, at that stage, on the verge of retirement. ... You make decisions about these issues. And my belief was that given that he was about to retire, that for me to make a political statement respecting my church at that time wasn't necessary.""  Watch him discuss his former pastor » . In the wide-ranging interview, Obama also hit back at rival Clinton's recent claims that he is standing in the way of revotes in Florida and Michigan. ""Sen. Clinton, I have to say on this, has been completely disingenuous. She said when she was still trying to compete with the votes in Iowa and New Hampshire that Michigan and Florida wouldn't count,"" he said. ""Then, as soon as she got into trouble politically and it looked like she would have no prospects of winning the nomination without having them count, suddenly she's extraordinarily concerned with the voters there."" ""I understand the politics of it, but let's be clear that it's politics,"" he added. ""I want the Michigan delegation and the Florida delegation to be seated. And however the Democratic National Committee determines we can get that done, I'm happy to abide by those rules.""  Watch what Obama has to say about DNC rules » . Those comments come hours after Clinton made a trip to Michigan and directly urged Obama to join her call to count the Michigan and Florida votes or hold new elections in those states. ""Sen. Obama speaks passionately on the trail about empowering American people. Today, I am urging him to match those words with actions to make sure people of Michigan and Florida have a voice and a vote in this election,"" Clinton said at a campaign rally in Detroit.  ""This is a crucial test [for Obama] -- does he mean what he says or not?"" Michigan and Florida held primaries in January, but the national party stripped them of their delegates for scheduling their contests too early.

"(CNN) -- A fatal train derailment south of Paris was caused by a part disconnecting from the switching mechanism on the tracks, the head of the French national railway company said Saturday. Six people were killed and 22 others injured late Friday afternoon when four cars of the train, a regional service bound for the city of Limoges, went off the track at Bretigny-sur-Orge station. On Saturday night, officials said the death toll was definitive. ""We are now sure that there are no additional victims,"" said Michel Fuzeau, the prefect for the Essonne department. A train car that was lying on its side at the station was lifted up and then inspected by firefighters and police, who did not find any additional victims, Fuzeau said. Various government officials and authorities had earlier given conflicting death tolls. A moment's silence for the victims was to be observed at noon Saturday at rail stations and on trains across France, said Guillaume Pepy, president of the railway company SNCF. Services have been suspended on the line where the accident occurred, Pepy said. Footage from the station Friday showed a scene of devastation, with the derailed train cars twisted and crumpled across the platform and track. Rescue workers searched the wreckage for the dead and injured. French President Francois Hollande visited the scene of the derailment Friday, when he praised the work of emergency responders. Hollande, who said he'd traveled on the route before, announced three investigations: a judicial inquiry, an internal inquiry within SNCF and an inquiry that will be handled by the country's transport ministry. The train was carrying about 370 people at the time of the incident. Alain Krakovitch, responsible for rail service safety and quality at SNCF, told BFMTV that the train was traveling at a normal speed when it reached Bretigny-sur-Orge about 20 minutes after its departure from Paris Austerlitz. The train and station platform were busy with travelers on what is a holiday weekend in France. A passenger in the first car of the train, whose name was given only as Laurent, told BFMTV he had felt a powerful shaking, lasting 10 to 15 seconds. Smoke was everywhere, he said. His rail car remained on the track, but the passengers could see the derailed cars behind, he said. Officials praised the swift reaction of the train's driver, which meant other train services were halted before they could hit the wreckage. ""The train driver had an extraordinary reflex in immediately signaling the alert,"" Transport Minister Frederic Cuvillier told BFMTV. Freight train hits truck and derails in Maryland .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- States appear to be taking more action to keep guns out of the hands of people with mental health problems in the wake of the Virginia Tech shootings, new figures show. Mental health problems would prohibit potential buyers from purchasing a gun. Submissions of mentally ill patients' records to the FBI's National Instant Criminal Background Check System for gun buyers have more than doubled since the massacre in April, the Justice Department announced Thursday. Currently, states are not required to send reports of mental health problems, which would prohibit buyers from purchasing a gun. But after the shootings -- when a student with a history of mental health problems killed 32 people before taking his own life -- the number of submissions to the database grew from 174,863 during the first half of the year to 393,957 from July to November. The number of states submitting the information also grew, from 23 before the Virginia Tech tragedy to 32 after it. The majority of the new records came from California authorities, who submitted more than 200,000 entries, the Justice Department said. Ohio boosted the amount of entries from three in March of this year to 7,845 in November. ""Instant background checks are essential to keeping guns out of the wrong hands, while still protecting the privacy of our citizens,"" Attorney General Michael Mukasey said to the National Association of Attorneys General. ""But as we learned in the tragedy at Virginia Tech, the checks must be accurate and complete to be effective."" Virginia Tech shooter Seung-Hui Cho was judged a danger to himself and ordered to get outpatient mental health treatment in 2005, but there was no indication he followed up. Virginia did not report his name to the FBI system because he hadn't been committed to a mental health facility. Cho bought one of the guns he used in the massacre online from an out-of-state dealer, picking it up from a Blacksburg, Virginia, pawn shop after background checks were complete. He bought his other pistol from a Roanoke gun dealer a month before the shooting. Officials say making sure information -- such as mental health records -- that would keep a person from buying a gun is available at a national level ensures that the individual doesn't go across state lines to try to make a purchase. Background checks, however, aren't necessary for firearms purchases made at gun shows or from a private seller, which, according to estimates, account for about half of the guns sold in the United States each year.

""What makes it so special is when you end up as the champion, that's why I am smiling,"" Sharapova said courtside after extending her run of at least one WTA title each year since 2003. ""I really appreciate these moments. This is what I do all the work for. When you have days like this ... it's a really nice feeling because everything has paid off."" The Russian, who boasted a 4-2 record over Wozniacki heading into the contest, needed just 81 minutes to claim her first title since the 2012 French Open. Sharapova, 25, started at breathtaking speed, pummeling her opponent with a degree of power which gave Wozniacki little chance. After breaking the World No.10 in the first game of the match, Sharapova rarely let up, claiming the first set 6-2 after unleashing a series of impressive winners. Sharapova then broke Wozniacki in the first game of the second set and then again once more before serving out for the match at 5-2. ""I think it was a tough match, a tough battle, and there were a lot of games that went to deuce and a lot of long games,"" Sharapova told reporters. ""I always felt like I was always a foot ahead, especially with the breaks. I was able to serve well today, and that helped me."" Wozniacki, who has 20 WTA titles to her name, is now hoping to bounce back in Miami next week. ""She was putting pressure on me from the start,"" Wozniacki told reporters. ""She was serving very well. I felt like everything that she wanted to do today was going in. She was making very few errors, and if she did, then it was really at the times where it didn't really matter. ""I have to say she just played too well today.""

"(CNN) -- Hip-hop artist Common wants to create a supportive community for youths on Chicago's South Side. The Grammy Award winner started the Common Ground Foundation to help underserved youth develop leadership and life skills. Common also performed at ""CNN Heroes: An All-Star Tribute"" last year. CNN's Allie Torgan recently spoke with him about CNN Heroes and his philanthropy. Below are excerpts: . Allie Torgan: What inspired you to start the Common Ground Foundation? Common: I started (the foundation) with some of my team members because we wanted to give back to the youth who didn't have some of the opportunities we had. The programs are really about building holistic people, children. We want them to be together and get educated on everything from health issues to just being allowed to be creative. Everything that's necessary to build a complete human being, we try to issue in with the Common Ground Foundation. The kids get to do creative cooking, creative writing and then also get assisted in some of their academic work in school. Torgan: Why is this cause important to you? Common: I grew up on the South Side of Chicago with my mother and my stepfather, and I was provided a nice home, a home with love in it. And I felt a lot of my friends didn't have some of the opportunities I had. Also, they had loved ones who they had lost. My whole life growing up, I was doing the little things that I could do (to help people). I would watch my mother do the things that she does. As a teacher, she's an educator and also would just go the extra mile to help people. Those are the traits that I picked up that made me say, ""Hey, I want to do this because I have seen, throughout my life, people I love that didn't have the chance, that didn't have the opportunities I had."" Torgan: What's your goal for the kids? Common: I want to empower the kids because there is a lot of gang violence and there is a lot of lack of love in the neighborhoods, and that starts in the home. I want to empower them first by letting them know that they are loved and people do care. They might not have the parent, or one parent might be missing, or one parent might not be sufficient in raising them. But they have other people that do care. And somewhere within this village is somebody that's going to reach out and help give them a chance to pursue their dream. So we empower them first by instilling some love in them and being their support system. And then we help to develop whatever their skills are. We want to prepare them to be able to go out into the world and do things for themselves so they can be leaders. It's about being their leader. You got to lead yourself first. Torgan: What was it like performing at ""CNN Heroes: An All-Star Tribute"" last year? Common: (It) was an incredible experience. I felt distinguished being there, because there were so many people who really cared about things. My mother told me before going there: getting invited there, that is an important place to be because that is where a lot of people that do the real work are. These are people who do work for real in the world helping people. And it was super-inspiring to me. I have to step up more, because you see people who dedicate their lives to helping others. Being able to perform with John Legend and Melanie Fiona was a great experience. I was like, ""I want to go back, I need to get invited back."" But more than anything, I was grateful to be there and observe people and honor the people that were selected to be CNN Heroes, because it was well deserved and they inspired us all. Torgan: What is a hero to you? Common: A hero to me is someone who is able to take whatever talent, gift, personality, quality and utilize it to help build others. And obviously a hero has done it to build themselves to a certain level. But you use the plateau you reached and you say, ""Hey, I can do something for other people to help them to get to the same place I got to."" So I look at a hero as somebody who is willing to sacrifice that and go back and reach out for others.","Grammy Award winner Common is reaching out to kids on Chicago's South Side .

"(CNN) -- French lawmakers voted to legalize same-sex marriage Tuesday, despite vocal protests from some conservatives opposed to the step. The nation's lower house approved a marriage bill, which would also give same-sex couples the right to adopt, in a 331-to-225 final vote. They cast their votes after impassioned speeches by lawmakers for and against the legislation. President Francois Hollande, who pledged his support for same-sex marriage on the campaign trail last year, will have to sign the bill before it becomes law. After Tuesday's lower house vote, a group of senators filed a legal challenge with the country's Constitutional Council, according to a statement published on the UMP conservative opposition party's senate website. The court has a month to rule on the challenge filed by conservative and centrist senators. iReport: Pro-gay marriage demonstrators hail lawmakers' move . The measure had been expected to pass Tuesday since the left, which includes Hollande's governing Socialist Party, dominates the National Assembly, or lower house. The legislation was approved in the Senate earlier this month. If the measure is enacted, France would be the ninth country in Europe to allow same-sex marriage. Protesters on Sunday joined the latest in a series of marches through Paris against the measure, and they have vowed to carry on the fight. One of the groups behind the marchers urged protesters to rally again Tuesday evening and is planning more demonstrations around the country next month. Policing has been stepped up in the streets around the lower house in case demonstrations by those for and against the bill become heated, CNN affiliate BFM-TV reported. In France, the contentious debate over the same-sex marriage bill has coincided with a spike in reported incidents of homophobic abuse, the gay rights group SOS Homophobie told BFM-TV last week. A gay bar in Lille was targeted Wednesday night by four men who appeared to belong to a far-right group, Interior Minister Manuel Valls said Thursday, in a statement condemning the attack. Valls also condemned violence that broke out Thursday evening at a march against same-sex marriage, when ""organized groups"" refused to disperse and clashed with police. France is committed to upholding the right of all people to demonstrate peacefully, he said. International debate . Passage of the divisive bill will admit France to a small but growing club. Lawmakers in New Zealand last week made it the first country in the Asia Pacific region to legalize same-sex marriage. The law is set to be enacted later this year. Its move came a week after Uruguayan lawmakers approved a measure allowing same-sex marriage. The measure awaits the signature of Uruguay's president, who has indicated he supports it. If the laws in New Zealand, Uruguay and France are enacted as expected, the count of nations allowing same-sex marriage will rise to 14. The first same-sex couples walked down the aisle in the Netherlands in 2001, with others following suit in Canada, South Africa, Belgium and Spain. Argentina was the first Latin American nation to legalize such marriages, in 2010. Legislators in the United Kingdom are also weighing proposals to legalize same-sex marriage. However, many countries remain split over the issue. In the United States, the question went before the Supreme Court last month, and justices are now deliberating over the matter. Nine states and the District of Columbia issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples, including three states -- Maryland, Washington, and Maine -- where voters approved it in ballot initiatives last year. Many states have specific laws blocking same-sex couples from legally marrying. Lawmakers in Australia voted against a bill to legalize same-sex marriage last September. A poll for the advocacy group Australian Marriage Equality indicated that 64% of those surveyed ""support marriage equality."" A law legalizing civil unions was introduced in 1999 in France under a previous Socialist government. Known in France as the PACS, or pacte civil de solidarite, the civil union agreement can be entered into by same-sex or straight couples and confers many but not all of the rights of marriage.

"(CNN) -- Critics are already gushing over Steven Spielberg's new ""Lincoln"" as a potential Oscar contender. Much of the praise centers on how the film makes the larger-than-life president at once heroic and human. By all accounts, it deftly explores both his personal and political wisdom through scenes like the one in which Daniel Day Lewis, who plays Honest Abe, cites ancient mathematical theory in an assessment of humanity: ""It's a self-evident truth that things that are equal to the same thing are equal to each other."" But even as moviegoers line up for tickets, some in Washington may well wonder what one special fan of Lincoln might take away from a screening. President Barack Obama is a self-professed, lifelong admirer of the 16th president, who is by many accounts the most popular and influential of all chief executives in American history. Holding Democratic 'blue wall' was crucial for Obama victory . Shortly before taking office in 2009, the Obama family made an unannounced late night visit to the Lincoln Memorial and since, the 44th president has stopped by again. Mr. Obama took his oath on the same Bible Lincoln used for his inauguration in 1861; a small volume sheathed in stained red velvet with gilt edges. He has frequently been spotted reading about Lincoln and he's fond of quoting the rail-splitter in his speeches, most notably during the recent Democratic National Convention. ""I'm far more mindful of my own failings,"" he told the convention crowd, ""knowing exactly what Lincoln meant when he said, 'I have been driven to my knees many times by the overwhelming conviction that I had no place else to go.'"" Some Lincolnophiles have since suggested he actually misquoted Lincoln in that instance, but the point remains: Obama is a big Lincoln fan. So what advice might Lincoln have for Obama as he heads toward a second term? In the land of Lincoln, at Illinois Wesleyan University, Professor Robert Bray is one of the nation's leading Lincoln scholars. He suggests that Lincoln Lesson One might be: Make your enemies into friends. Bray notes that Lincoln had an enormous talent for turning around even his fiercest opponents. ""He was able to keep his eye on the prize,"" Bray says, ""which means he was able to disassociate himself from personal attacks."" No matter how cruelly his foes savaged him, Lincoln repeatedly rose above the fray, using humor and warmth to disarm his enemies and refocus everyone on the agenda at hand. Instances of his temper showing, Bray notes, were rare. Opinion: Election a call for purple politics . Lincoln Lesson Two: Be firm, but play nice. Lincoln was no pushover. Despite his legendarily laconic style, Bray says Lincoln had a single-minded ability to steadily exert political pressure on others, inexorably pushing them toward the action he wanted, or rather he felt the nation needed. And yet, he did so in a way that left others feeling unthreatened. ""He could talk without anger,"" Bray says. ""He could talk without heat to his political opponents."" Lincoln Lesson Three: Take the long view. Lincoln clearly saw the future in a way that many of his contemporaries could not. He imagined not merely the end of slavery, but also the repercussions that would follow for freed African Americans, southern citizens, and northerners as well. He knew resolution might take many years, and yet he tried to point the politics of the day in the proper direction. ""He believed firmly, I think, that if we put our heads to it and we put our wills to it, the American people could be that shining example of equality for the world,"" Bray says. Bray is the first to say that there is so much more about Lincoln, noting the volumes of work about him. At Ford's Theater, where Lincoln was assassinated, workers constructed a 34-foot tall tower of books to represent all the titles published about Lincoln; more than 15,000 in all, according to their count. It is unlikely that Obama has read them all and it is not known when or if he'll see the new Lincoln movie, but undoubtedly, Abe still has plenty of lessons for our times ... honestly.","New ""Lincoln"" film offers opportunities, advice for Barack Obama .

"(CNN) -- Mexico's military has notched an important success for President Felipe Calderon with the arrest of Jorge Eduardo Costilla Sanchez, the reputed boss of the powerful Gulf drug cartel. Costilla, nicknamed ""El Coss,"" was captured without a fight in the coastal city of Tampico, in the border state of Tamaulipas, Navy spokesman Jose Luis Vergara said Thursday. Wednesday's arrest -- together with the seizure of weapons, vehicles and jewels -- is a much needed achievement for Calderon, whose offensive against drug cartels has done little to stem drug-related violence or the volume of drugs transported through Mexico. The mustachioed Costilla, handcuffed and wearing a checkered long-sleeve shirt under a bulletproof vest, was presented before reporters. Mexican marines chased a vehicle of armed men into a residence in Tampico, where they ""surprised"" Costilla and arrested him, Vergara said. Costilla is said to head a criminal group considered the third-most powerful in Mexico. ""El Coss is an important actor,"" said George Grayson, professor of government at the College of William & Mary and expert of drug cartels. ""His capture is a tremendous blow to the Gulf cartel."" Five others were arrested with Costilla, and of five of his bodyguards were arrested after a shootout in a separate city, Vergara said. Some of them wore camouflage uniforms when they were presented next to Costilla. There are rewards in Mexico and the United States for Costilla's arrest. Costilla has been indicted in the United States, accused of drug trafficking and threatening U.S. law enforcement officials in November 1999. In that incident, according to the U.S. State Department, Costilla and other suspected Gulf Cartel leaders allegedly stopped federal agents and pointed AK-47 rifles at them. The agents were allowed to leave after a standoff. The State Department offered a reward of up to $5 million for information leading to Costilla's arrest. In Mexico, where Costilla is on the government's list of the 37 most-wanted traffickers, officials offered more than $2 million for his capture. While not as powerful as it once was, the Gulf Cartel is one of Mexico's major drug trafficking organizations. Costilla assumed a top role after the arrest of former Gulf Cartel boss Osiel Cardenas Guillen and became the top leader after a rift with Cardenas' relatives in the organization, authorities have said. As Costilla rose in the cartel hierarchy, the group controlled smuggling routes in northeastern Mexico by using its enforcement arm, known as Los Zetas, authorities have said. But Los Zetas later split into its own violent cartel, and for several years has been fighting the Gulf Cartel for the lucrative turf. ""El Coss survived internal divisions and directed violent confrontations in Tamaulipas and Nuevo Leon against his former allies, Los Zetas,"" Vergara said. The arrest is the latest in a series of blows against the Gulf Cartel, based in the city of Matamoros, across the border from Brownsville, Texas. This month, Mario Cardenas Guillen, reputed leader of the Gulf faction loyal to the Cardenas family, was also arrested by the military. Costilla's arrest was the result of ""intense intelligence"" work by the Navy, and information gleaned from Mario Cardenas' arrest, Vergara said. The rival Zetas, who operate in the same northeastern part of the country, may seem poised to take advantage of their rival's vulnerability. But Grayson said internal divisions within the Zetas will prevent them from turning the heat up on the Gulf cartel, and that the Sinaloa cartel will be the trafficking group most likely to strengthen its position. In the past, surges in violence have been recorded after the killing or capture of cartel bosses. Internal rifts within the Gulf cartel and Zetas could lead to fights and alliances in a ""kaleidoscope situation,"" Grayson said. The other big winner is the Mexican Navy and its marines, who again proved they are effective at going after high-profile targets, he said. In 2009, the marines were responsible for another of the Calderon administration's biggest gets when they killed kingpin Arturo Beltran Leyva in a shootout. The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration has provided intelligence to Mexican authorities during several operations, including the one that brought an end to Beltran Leyva. But the arrest of Costilla was a ""Mexican operation,"" said the U.S. drug agency's spokesman, Rusty Payne. ""Obviously when a major cartel leader is arrested and brought to justice, it is significant. DEA congratulates the government of Mexico and their brave military for their continued success in apprehending top drug traffickers,"" Payne said.","NEW: This was a Mexican operation, the DEA says .

"Cairo (CNN) -- A fire erupted at the entrance to Egypt's presidential palace Friday night as protesters hurled Molotov cocktails and rocks at security forces, who responded with tear gas and water cannon. One person was fatally shot during clashes, according to an official from Cairo's Heliopolis Hospital, and authorities were seen dragging away demonstrators. Egyptian television aired live footage of security forces beating a naked man on the ground. The Ministry of Interior said it would investigate the incident. The nation has been rocked by violence since last week's second anniversary of its revolution. Protesters have fumed over the slow pace of change and recent edicts by President Mohammed Morsy, who imposed a 30-day curfew on areas engulfed by violence. State TV reported that security forces were clearing the area in front of the palace as rioting continued. ""The continued attacks suggest a real breakdown in central power, we're coming close to that,"" said Steven Cook, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. ""None of the political forces have control over the people in the streets."" Amid the political and economic discontent, Morsy and opposition groups vowed to keep their supporters off the streets in an effort to avoid further bloodshed. Fear and loathing in Egypt: The fallout from Port Said . Earlier this week, anti-government protesters ignored Morsy's curfew in cities along the Suez Canal and clashed with police and military troops, raising more questions about the stability of the Middle East's most populous nation. Outgoing U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, in an interview with CNN this week, echoed concerns about what a collapse of the Egyptian state could mean for the broader region. ""I think that would lead to incredible chaos and violence on a scale that would be devastating,"" she said Tuesday at the State Department. ""There has to be some understanding by the new government that the aspirations that the people were expressing during the revolution in Egypt have to be taken seriously."" Friday's protests are the latest in the seesaw struggle between Egypt's first democratically elected president and dissidents who say his leadership is a throwback to past dictatorships, particularly the reign of President Hosni Mubarak, who was toppled two years ago in the popular revolt. Could Egypt fall apart? Dozens of deaths have resulted, prompting Navi Pillay, the U.N. high commissioner for human rights, to denounce the violence and call for dialogue among all parties. She said Morsy's state of emergency declaration should be governed by the rule of law, in line with international standards, and urged him to listen to the demands of demonstrators and take action to deal with problems in the judicial system.

"(CNN) -- Penn State's Board of Trustees on Friday authorized the school to offer settlements to some of the men who say former assistant football coach Jerry Sandusky abused them. No settlement agreements have been signed, the board said in a statement after its meeting Friday. The settlement offers apply to a number of people who have made claims against Penn State arising from the Sandusky case, the board said.

""As we have previously said, the university intends to deal with these individuals in a fair and expeditious manner, with due regard to their privacy."" The board said the settlement offers are ""within a range of dollar values"" that is being kept confidential. It said there would be no more comments until the settlements have been finalized and agreed to. Painful chapter closes with Sandusky's conviction .

"(CNN) -- Seeing lightness and color are the simplest sensations the brain has. And yet even at this most basic level we never see the light that falls onto our eyes (called the retinal image) or even the real-world source of that image. Rather, neuroscience research tells us that we only ever see what proved useful to see in the past. Illusions are a simple but powerful example of this point. Like all our perceptions, we see illusions because the brain evolved not to see the retinal image, but to resolve the inherent ""meaninglessness"" of that image by continually redefining normality, a normality that is necessarily grounded in relationships, history and ecology. Which is why we innately find regularities in information and reflexively imbue those regularities with value. But it is the value, not the information itself we see. So, tomorrow morning when you open your eyes and look ""out into"" the world, don't be fooled. You're in fact looking in. You're not seeing the world; you're seeing a world ... an internal map of value-relations derived from interactions within a particular, narrow context. Another essential point about illusions implied in my TED talk is that they reveal our amazing capacity to entertain mutually exclusive internal realities simultaneously. Learn what TED is all about . For instance, while looking at one of my color illusions (say the multicolored cube) you're aware of one reality: that two tiles look very different, while simultaneously being aware of an opposite reality: that the two tiles are in fact physically the same. This capacity to be an observer of yourself is phenomenal and possibly unique to humans. Indeed, to literally ""see yourself see"" is in my view the principal act of consciousness, which has the power to transform one's view of the world and of oneself. The importance of the above observations stemming from my own work and that of others transcend neuroscience. They show us in an explicit (and I hope engaging) way that our senses are not ""fragile,"" as many would have you believe. They show us instead that we are not outside observers of nature defined in isolation. We are instead indivisible from nature, defined by the trial and error process of interaction, a process in which we can choose to become active agents (but too often choose not to). Understanding this point is I believe critical to personal and social well-being, since the typical barrier to a deeper insight into oneself and others is the overriding, but necessarily false impression that what ""I"" see, what ""I"" hear and what ""I"" know is the world as it really is. But, by ""seeing yourself see,"" in other words by actively exploring how your thoughts, feelings, beliefs and even the colors you see reflect your physical, social and cultural ecology, only then is it possible to understand the source of coherence and conflict within and between individuals. Put another way, only by accepting my own humanity can I accept the humanity of others. ""Seeing myself see"" creates the opportunity for this acceptance. Illusions, then, were not the point of my talk, but simply a tool for encouraging this process. Resolving uncertainty is essential to our survival. Hence our fear of ambiguous situations is palpable -- e.g., the inability to resolve sensory conflict between the eyes and ears can result in nausea (like seasickness). And yet it is only by embracing the unknown within education, science, art and most importantly within our own private lives that we will find new routes to more enlightened ways of seeing and being. Thus, courage not confidence is at the heart of this process of actively redefining normality, which is the route to compassion and creativity. Encouraging this process by celebrating uncertainty is the raison d'etre of my work ... from the science of human and bee perception, to the art of translating images into music, to the design of a glass windmill for primary schools, to the creation of the ""My School"" educational program (a framework for teaching and architecture that directly supports creativity, community choice and compassion), even to giving a talk at TED. By providing relevant, tangible and accessible frameworks for others to take part in the process of discovery, I hope -- in a very modest way -- that my work will help foster a more empathetic view of nature and human nature. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Beau Lotto.","R. Beau Lotto: We only ever see what proved useful to see in the past .

"(CNN) -- Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki called for dialogue and resolve to halt the recent rise in violence across the country and avert a ""civil war."" ""We should not let those extremists ignite the sectarian strife in this country,"" he said Thursday in a nationwide address. Over the past three days, nearly 100 people have been killed and hundreds of others wounded in clashes between Iraqi security forces and Sunni tribes in northern Iraqi provinces, including Salaheddin, Nineveh and Kirkuk. In the latest clashes, gunmen and Iraqi federal police faced off Thursday night in the city of Falluja, a predominantly Sunni city in Iraq's Anbar province, Iraqi police told CNN. At least four people were killed in fighting between gunmen and Iraqi security forces in the town of Qarataba, north of Baquba, police said. Elsewhere, at least one person was killed and seven were wounded when a car bomb exploded near an outdoor market in the Shiite holy city of Najaf, south of Baghdad, Iraqi police officials said. Iraq, on edge over violence, endures more bloodshed . Al-Maliki called for dialogue among tribal leaders, government officials and security forces to stop the fighting from spiraling out of control and to keep the country's nascent democracy from unraveling. The government Saturday held provincial elections throughout most of the country. There was minor violence during the vote, and the exercise was praised by international and Iraqi leaders. Sunnis, who comprise a minority of Iraqis, had clout during the Saddam Hussein era but have been politically marginalized since his overthrow. Shiites, who make up a majority of Iraqis, dominate the government. Since December, tens of thousands of Sunni demonstrators have taken to the streets, demanding that the Shiite-led government stop what they call second-class treatment of Iraq's Sunni community. Deadly wave of bombings across Iraq ahead of elections . Iraq was engulfed by Sunni-Shiite sectarian warfare in the last decade, and al-Maliki reminded the country that ""everyone will lose if civil war breaks out."" State TV showed file video footage of people being tortured under Hussein's regime to remind Iraqis of past violence. The latest violence occurred in Mosul, in Nineveh province. Hundreds of Sunni tribe members attacked police checkpoints and security posts in a several neighborhoods, in protest against security force actions Tuesday in Hawija. From Wednesday night through Thursday, federal security forces killed 31 ""terrorists"" and freed 17 police officers, said Mehdi al-Gharrawi, the commander of federal police in Mosul. At least eight police officers have been killed in the city since Wednesday, police said. The situation has since been brought under control.","NEW: Four people killed in clashes between gunmen and security forces, police say .

"(CNN) -- Mark Cavendish's eventful week at the Tour de France continued Thursday when he was beaten to the line by Marcel Kittel in a sprint finish. Holding more than a bike's length lead nearing the end of the 135-mile 12th stage from Fougeres to Tours in northwest France, Cavendish was caught and finished half a wheel behind the German. Kittel claimed his third stage victory this year. ""They say good things happen in threes and that has happened for me today,"" said Kittel. On Tuesday Cavendish drew criticism from Tom Veelers after the riders collided as part of a sprint finish, leaving the Dutchman -- Kittel's Argos-Shimano teammate -- on the ground. ""I would like to dedicate this win to my team, especially Tom Veelers who had to fight today just to finish,"" added Kittel. Although he was cleared of any wrongdoing by race officials, Cavendish was sprayed with urine by a spectator and jeered as he rode Wednesday. And according to the Daily Mail, organizers of a race in the Netherlands after the Tour de France have told Cavendish not to bother showing up following the incident with Veelers. Expected to have a major say in the overall points classification at the Tour de France, Omega Pharma-Quick Step's Cavendish has only won one stage and trails Cannondale's Peter Sagan by 96 points with sprint friendly stages running out. Kittel rose to fourth after Thursday's victory. ""Like I said, @marcelkittel's the new big thing,"" tweeted Cavendish. ""Simply better than me today. Congrats! Sorry I couldn't finish @opqscyclingteam's hard work."" Cavendish won the green jersey in 2011 but Sagan, third on Thursday, was the 2012 winner. Team Sky's Chris Froome retained his lead of three minutes, 25 seconds over Movistar's Alejandro Valverde, with two-time race Alberto Contador of Saxo-Tinkoff staying under four minutes behind. Froome, though, narrowly missed being involved in a nasty crash as the stage came to a close. He was about two bike lengths ahead of the carnage that left teammate Edvald Boasson Hagen nursing shoulder and arm injuries. ""I could hear the crash behind me, but I didn't see anything,"" said Froome. ""It seems like there's no such thing as an easy day on the Tour de France. ""It was a hard day. Every time I cross the finish line there's a little sigh of relief.""","Germany's Marcel Kittel rallies to beat Mark Cavendish in a sprint finish at the Tour de France .

"(CNN) -- Jared Lee Loughner was frightening fellow students and acting ""creepy"" and ""very hostile"" in incidents throughout 2010, according to newly released records from the community college that ultimately suspended him. Loughner, accused in Saturday's rampage in Tucson, Arizona, that left six people dead and apparently targeted Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, was the subject of several reports by the Pima Community College Department of Public Safety and the college's police department. In February, a report from the Department of Public Safety said Loughner reacted strangely to a poem read in one of his classes. He ""said things that were a huge leap from the context of the poem and said things about abortion, wars, killing people, and 'why don't we just strap bombs to babies,' "" according to the report. The school's Division Dean Patricia Houston ""said that Loughner has a 'dark personality' and is kind of 'creepy' and they had resolved to just keep an eye on him,"" according to the report. It added that one student thought Loughner might have a knife in a protective cover but wasn't sure. Loughner had ""some prior drug involvements but no warrants or anything of immediate concern,"" the reported noted. Two months later, in April, a public safety officer responded to an incident inside a campus library. A staffer complained that Loughner was making some loud noises at a computer. When questioned by the officer, Loughner explained that he ""was really into music and that sometimes he would be enjoying the music and excitedly utter phrases and words from the songs"" when listening on earphones. The next month, there was a report of ""suspicious activity"" involving Loughner in a Pilates class. When he was told his grade would be a B, he became ""very hostile."" The teacher ""felt like it might become physical"" and felt ""intimidated,"" according to the report. In June, Loughner was reported to be disruptive in math class. A report suggested that he could be under the influence of a controlled substance. Among his strange behaviors: He insisted on calling the number six ""18."" ""Houston has advised that the instructor and students in the class are uncomfortable with Loughner inside their class and are afraid of any repercussions that could exist from Loughner being unstable in his actions,"" the report said. In September, police were dispatched after Loughner created ""a disturbance"" in a class when he was told he would get only half-credit on an assignment because it was late. ""Loughner could not verbalize what the problem was and kept referring back to the freedom of speech,"" the report said. As Loughner spoke to an officer, he tilted his head, and his eyes were ""jittery and looking up and to the left."" Loughner also kept speaking of his ""freedom of thought,"" the report said. An officer put him through ""a channel of basic reasoning questions."" One was whether it's OK to yell ""fire"" in a crowded theater. ""Loughner's thought process through the freedom of speech thinking is yes, that is acceptable because he has the freedom of speech and there is no consequence."" The report noted ""that there might be a mental health concern involved with Loughner."" Days later, on September 29, a police officer was dispatched to deliver a suspension letter to Loughner. When the officer found the young man, he was with his father. ""While inside the garage I spoke with Jared who held a constant trance of staring as I narrated the events that had transpired,"" the officer wrote in his report. It took an hour. Jared Loughner then responded, ""I realize now that this is all a scam,"" according to the report. Later that day, police were asked to look into a suspicious YouTube video called Called ""Pima Community College School-Genocide/Scam-Free Education -- broken United States Constitution."" The narrator, who identified himself as ""Jared,"" said, ""We are examining the torture of students,"" and added, ""This is my genocide school."" He also said, ""I haven't forgotten the teacher that gave me a B for freedom of speech."" Loughner was enrolled at Aztec Middle College, a partnership between Tucson schools and Pima Community College that helps high school dropouts transition to community colleges, PCC President Sylvia Lee said. He took classes at the college until October, when withdrew after five contacts with police and a suspension. Algebra instructor Ben McGahee said he had Loughner removed from his class in June after multiple disruptions in the first three weeks of the course. McGahee said Loughner sometimes shook, blurted things out in class and appeared to be under the influence of drugs at times. Another classmate, Steven Cates, said Loughner ""would sit at his desk with that grin that you see in the mug shot that I've seen on the news"" and clenching his fists. Pima Community College told Loughner that he needed a letter from a mental health professional certifying that he posed no danger to himself or others before he would be allowed to return. Yet nothing in his record turned up in the background check carried out in November, when he bought the weapon police say was used in the killings. CNN's Jim Barnett contributed to this story.","Loughner is accused in the shooting deaths of six people in Tucson .

"(CNN) -- An explosion in a southern Iranian mosque that killed 10 people and wounded 160 after evening prayers Saturday night was caused by negligent handling of live munitions, not a bomb as first suspected, Iranian media reported. Shiraz, Iran, is well known for being home to many scholars, artists and poets. The blast and subsequent fire occurred about 6 p.m. Saturday in the men's section of a mosque in the city of Shiraz, Iran's Fars news agency reported. Fars initially reported the explosion was caused by a home-made bomb. Provincial Police Commander Ali Moaeyri later told Fars it ""was not sabotage."" ""Some live munitions may have been left behind at that location which could have been the cause of the explosion,"" Moaeyri said. The police commander said the munitions were apparently left behind after a ""Sacred Defense"" exhibition was held at the mosque, which also serves as a cultural center. Local militia groups -- known as Basij -- often use the mosques for meeting places. Iran's official news agency, IRNA, put the number of casualties at 10 dead and 160 wounded. Survivors were being treated at 12 hospitals, IRNA reported. Fars estimated 800 people, mostly young, were gathered at the mosque Saturday evening to hear a cleric's sermon denouncing Bahai and Wahabi faiths -- both of which are considered heresies by some Shiites. Bombings are unusual in Iran, thought the predominantly Shiite Muslim country has endured sporadic attacks in recent years. The last major bombing occurred in February 2007, when a car bomb blew up near a bus carrying members of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Corps, leaving a dozen dead and injuring dozens more in southeastern Iran. Shiraz -- a historical city of more than 1 million people -- is well known for being home to many scholars, artists, poets and local craftsmanship of rugs and metalwork. The tourist city is about 400 miles south of Tehran, the capital. E-mail to a friend .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- The decision of English Premier League giants Manchester United to ban their players from signing autographs at the team's training ground won't affect the sports memorabilia market significantly, an industry expert says. Sorry kids: Manchester United will no longer be giving autographs at their Carrington training ground. The move to ban autographs was announced by Sir Alex Ferguson in the team's match day program for Saturday's 2-1 win over Blackburn Rovers at Old Trafford. Ferguson said in the program he wanted to put a stop to memorabilia dealers using the autographs for financial gain. ""I offer apologies to fans who come to the Carrington training ground looking for autographs, he wrote. ""The problem is that we have had too many opportunists selling on signed merchandise. They are not fans at all,"" Ferguson said. While the Independent Manchester United Supporters' Association declined to comment on the issue, a spokesman from a Kent-based supporters' club ""Invicta Reds"" said he was happy to agree with the manager's decision. ""If Fergie (Sir Alex Ferguson) likes it then it's good for us all,"" the spokesman told CNN. Do you feel autograph-hunters need to be targeted or is this unfair on other fans? Tell us in the Sound Off box below. The decision comes at a time when the market for replica jerseys and other autographed football memorabilia continues to grow significantly. A quick trawl of the UK's version of auction site eBay shows almost 16,000 autographed football items for sale. These items include signed jerseys, cards, photos, books and prints. Prices vary greatly, however, a David Beckham Manchester United shirt was selling for £300 ($436) on Monday. Vice-president of operations at sportsmemorabilia.com, Mike Gallucci, speaking to CNN, estimated the autographed memorabilia industry was worth about $4 billion a year. ""It has definitely been growing, it's big business. In the past, people hadn't realized the price they could get for some of these items. ""The power of the Internet has changed this. However, with more players signing more autographs, the market is a little flooded with the items,"" he said. Gallucci said less accessibility to players for some fans shouldn't alter the market too much as the items sourced from official routes were usually the most popular. ""People who want a 100 percent genuine item will buy through a company where they can verify the authenticity,"" he said. A spokeswoman for eBay said the trading of football memorabilia was very popular on the site and had grown in recent years. More than 90,000 items had been listed in the last three months, and eBay had noticed ""a shift in people starting to sell their memorabilia on the site to make money,"" the spokeswoman told CNN. In the U.S. market, players in sports such as baseball sometimes only signed autographed items on pre-arranged and contracted deals with memorabilia companies, Galluci said. A 2007 Forbes magazine list rating the top ten sports collectibles ranked baseball star Mark McGwire's record 70th home-run ball as the most expensive -- with an estimated value of $3,005,000. All of the top ten items on the list are baseball memorabilia. See the list here.","Manchester United have banned players from giving autographs at training .

"(CNN) -- A federal appeals court in San Francisco has temporarily halted the forced medication of Tucson shooting defendant Jared Loughner until a three-judge panel can hear competing arguments from his lawyers and prosecutors by mid-week. Loughner is charged with seriously wounding U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords in a January rampage that also left six others dead. The brief order from a three-judge panel of the 9th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals set a tight deadline for lawyers from both sides to file more detailed legal briefs. The federal government has until 5 p.m. PT Wednesday to argue the involuntary medication should continue. Loughner's lawyers had appealed Friday an earlier ruling allowing prison doctors to forcibly medicate him with strong drugs. The appeals judges will decide whether to issue a permanent order that could extend the ban on forced medication, or allow the procedure to resume. There was no indication how soon the panel would rule. Last week, a federal judge in San Diego rejected a motion by lawyers for Loughner to prevent prison doctors from forcibly medicating the Arizona shooting suspect. ""I defer to medical judgment,"" U.S. District Judge Larry Alan Burns said in ruling that prison doctors were within their rights to force Loughner to take mind-altering psychotropic drugs against his will. ""I have no reason to disagree with the doctors here."" Burns also ordered that sensitive medical and legal documents relating to Loughner's treatment for mental illness remain sealed. Loughner has already started receiving the powerful drugs, and lawyers representing Loughner contend that forcing him to take the drugs against his will violates his rights. Authorities at the U.S. Medical Center for Federal Prisoners in Springfield, Missouri, where Loughner is being held, should have tried lesser restraints such as milder tranquilizers, argued Reuben Camper Cahn, one of Loughner's lawyers. Prosecutors responded in last week's hearing that prison officials acted properly in ordering the medication, which they said was necessary for Loughner to control his mental illness. ""This is a person who is a ticking time bomb,"" prosecutor Wallace Kleindienst said. ""He's lunged at his defense counsel and spits at her."" Loughner, 22, is charged in the January mass shooting in which six people were killed and 13 wounded, including Giffords, in front of a Safeway grocery story in Tucson, Arizona. A federal judge ruled last month that Loughner was not competent to stand trial, and he was sent to the federal facility in Springfield. Loughner's lawyers said prison officials held a deficient hearing process and used faulty reasoning in deciding to drug Loughner against his will. For example, Loughner had no attorney present at the June 14 hearing, the lawyers said in their motion, and officials failed to state the drug and dosage he should receive. According to the emergency motion filed last month, authorities had earlier assessed Loughner as dangerous because of incidents before his transfer to the Springfield prison: He threw a chair against a door and spat at an attorney. However, the reasoning by prison officials in Springfield for deciding to administer the drugs was to treat Loughner's mental illness, rather than to subdue any dangerous behavior, the motion said. Prosecutors had argued in their response that Loughner received a proper administrative hearing on the matter, and the medication prescribed was necessary to prevent him from being a danger to himself and others. CNN's Bill Mears and Michael Martinez contributed to this report.","Last week, Loughner's attorney lost a motion asking for a halt to the forced medication .
But a federal appeals court on Tuesday temporarily halts the forced medication .

"Tel Aviv, Israel (CNN) -- Gil Shwed is an Israeli programmer and entrepreneur who is regarded as one of the fathers of modern Internet security. He got his first job writing software at the age of 12, and by 1993, at the age of 24, he formed the Internet security company Check Point with two business partners and a borrowed computer in his associate's grandmother's apartment in Tel Aviv. Check Point created the first firewall using ""stateful inspection"" -- the second-generation of firewall technology widely used today. In the years since, hacking has become big business -- one of the fastest growing areas of crime, according to Interpol, with an estimated global cost of $1 trillion a year. Read: Materials that magically mend themselves . As a result, his company Check Point now has grown to boast nearly 3,000 staff and accounts for one third of the global security software market, with its security software used by every Fortune 100 company. ""In 1993, most people didn't know what the Internet is all about,"" says Shwed, who sensed the Internet would be big but had no idea it would grow to become as central to modern life as it has. ""I never imagined the Internet to have such a huge effect on the world or for Check Point to be a company that sells for nearly a billion-and-a-half dollars today,"" he said. But as vital as the Internet -- and by extension, cyber security -- has become to our lives, few of us really have a handle on how it works. Here, Shwed explains of some of the basic concepts. What's a firewall? A firewall is a piece of software or hardware that protects the security of a computer network -- be it a home or business network -- by controlling incoming and outgoing traffic between the network and the rest of the Internet. Some form of security is necessary to protect computer networks from hackers. ""Basically, a simple system connected to the Internet, every hacker can break in in a few seconds. You put some layers of security; the efforts required to break in are becoming bigger."" A firewall works by analyzing incoming data packets and determining whether they should be allowed through. Read: Smartphone knows if you're happy or sad . ""It can just sit in the entrance to the organization like a door and you block whoever goes in or goes out,"" says Shwed. ""It knows how to analyze the traffic and basically classify each type of connection."" Today, firewalls are becoming increasingly complicated, says Shwed. ""There are multiple layers and you need to provide... many different types of protection, many different types of the system,"" he says. ""Today, the firewall does probably ten more things: it knows how to encrypt your traffic when you communicate with mobile devices, it knows how to scan the data for potential leakage... It knows how to look for very sophisticated attacks; it knows how to look for bots."" What are bots? Also known as web robots, bots are software applications that run automated tasks over the Internet, and are often used for malicious purposes. ""Bots are small software agents that sit on our personal computers. They hide there, they communicate with their operator which tells them what bad things to do,"" says Shwed. Bots can often be disguised in legitimate-looking content to infect vulnerable computer networks. Read: Will dandelion tires gain traction? ""(The firewall) knows how to find these kinds of communications that disguise themselves in sort of legal communications."" Computers infected with malicious bots can be by directed by the third party controlling them -- known as a ""bot herder"" -- to perform tasks en masse, such as a distributed denial of service, or DDoS attack. In a DDoS attack, massive networks of infected ""zombie"" computers are directed to target a system with traffic, overloading and effectively crashing the targeted network. How has the threat environment changed? ""Twenty years ago, the typical hacker was like a student trying to show his technical skills with no bad intentions,"" says Shwed. ""Today it's governments, sophisticated organizations."" He said that ""every business today is facing hundreds, if not thousands of attacks everyday. And these attacks can go from small things that slow you down to bad things that will stop your business right away immediately. ""That motivation can be political, it can be financial -- stealing data or things like that. It can be extortion."" The extortion could take the form of a threat to take down a network if a sum was not paid, or a more subtle approach. ""We've seen several cases where somebody calls an organization and says 'I'm a security researcher, I've found that your company is being targeted. I'll let you know how to block it if you pay me my consulting fees.' It can start from small amounts, $5000, $15000."" But while large companies and governments were obvious and attractive targets, home computer users were just as vulnerable, as general attacks were aimed at security vulnerabilities, rather than specific targets. ""The general break-ins are not happening by targeted attacks, by somebody trying to attack you or your organization. The general attacks (come through) tools that scan the Internet and find the place to break in -- and wherever they can break in, they'll break into."" It sounds overwhelming. Are there any new approaches to the problem? Shwed's company has a new product called ThreatCloud, which it bills as the first collaborative approach to fighting cybercrime. ""One of the things we realized about two years ago is that today every company, every person in the world fights cyber threats individually. We all install systems, we're all being attacked, in many cases, by the same people, thousands of times a day. ""So what we came up with was that idea of a threat cloud. And ThreatCloud is like a collaboration network -- whenever a customer network sees an attack or sees something suspicious, it reports to the ThreatCloud service (which) analyzes threats from multiple sources. ""If it finds out that it's actually an attack, it can automatically update the rest of the world and let everybody enjoy that intelligence, that know-how that some attack has been happening and everybody should block that source.""","Gil Shwed is the CEO of Check Point, a leading name in computer security software .

"(CNN) -- After being detained for allegedly erupting outside a Tucson, Arizona, supermarket -- gunning down 19 people, including six fatally -- Jared Lee Loughner refused to talk to investigators. But, well before, the 22-year-old had proven quick and ready to share his opinions and experiences with strangers online. A picture on his MySpace bulletin board posted just six hours before the shooting was by no means Loughner's only foray into social media. In fact, on several websites over the past three years, Loughner presented over-the-top assertions, posed random questions and made rambling comments that drew sympathy, scorn and confusion from others in his online forums. He griped about losing job after job. Ranted about handicapped people and the educational system. And opened up about his round-the-clock struggle with aggression and difficulty in finding companionship. ""He seems like one of those people who avoids substance abuse because he is already strange,"" one commenter posted about an online persona, later identified as Loughner, on a thread on the gaming website Earth Empires. Postings on Earth Empires, which bills itself as a ""free browser-based strategy game"" in which members take over a nation's economy and military, were similar to those of a person believed to be Loughner made on the site, Abovetopsecret.com, as well as on MySpace. Together, these online comments and diatribes suggest a person eagerly trying to engage others, unafraid to articulate his personal struggles and, while only rarely hinting at violence, displaying little in the way of political correctness or respect for powers-that-be. Even as he had frightened fellow students and alarmed instructors at Pima Community College, a poster identified Friday on the Earth Empires site as ""Dare"" and referred to, in responses and by himself, as Jared often interacted with fellow users. An Earth Empires blog posted Friday said that Loughner had made more than 100 posts on 50 topics, having participated in games on the site since his high school days. He'd started nearly 30 of these threads himself, but had not been active since June 2010, according to the post. ""As a community, we are absolutely horrified that someone who had been part of our relatively small group could be involved in such a horrible act,"" the post said. Beyond the gaming elements, Earth Empires also features private threads in which its members can comment on a variety of topics. That includes rants on hot-button topics and even cartoons, including one in which the poster, Dare, refers to himself as Jared. Some postings are lighter in nature, on subjects ranging from weightlifting to taxidermy to Dare's affinity for the music group Insane Clown Posse. But others are deeper. On a thread he started that solicits stories about rejection by the opposite sex, he expresses sadness. And on a thread about the participants' hardest final exam, Dare ends one comment with the words ""Mental breakdown."" He titled one message string ""Would you hit a Handy Cap Child/Adult?,"" posting insulting words about and images of mentally challenged people. On a May 9 thread, Dare asks: ""Dose (sic) anyone have aggression 24/7?"" While they engage and kid with him on occasion, fellow commenters on Earth Empires increasingly call out Dare for what they call his nonsensical rants. Dare's posts also dwell extensively on his employment history. On a thread started by Dare on May 14, 2010, the poster expresses his disgust after filling out more than 20 applications for a part-time job and being rejected. According to the post, Dare was terminated from ""Peter Piper Pizza, Chineese fast food, Red Robin - @[User who knew Jared outside of the game] ...The drug hang out., Quiznos, and Eddie Bauer."" Dan Barnes, owner of the Red Robin in the Tucson Mall, told CNN in a phone interview that Loughner was employed at his restaurant as a busboy from November 2006 until February 2008, when he put in his two-week notice and told Barnes that he planned to join the Army. ""He was a good, quiet kid,"" Barnes said. ""We have no negative items in his file."" A person at the Tucson office of Peter Piper Pizza confirmed that Loughner was employed from January to March 2006 at the pizza parlor on West Ina Road, down the street from where the shooting occurred in Tucson. No one there recalled Loughner, but payroll records verified he worked as a general crew member. Jose Landeros, who said he worked with Loughner at Quiznos, told CNN's John King on Tuesday that Loughner was fired because of poor customer service and that he ""didn't really care about work or anything."" Doreen Jarman, a spokesperson for Eddie Bauer, said by e-mail that ""Loughner was not employed at Eddie Bauer at the time of Saturday's incident and has not worked for the company for more than a year."" Dare is approximately the inverse of the name Erad3, which was used on another website, abovetopsecret.com. Mark Allin, that site's co-owner, said he believes Erad3 is Loughner. Between February 2009 and September 2010, Erad3 made assertions such as that NASA had never flown a manned space shuttle mission, there was no Mars rover, and people can make their own currency. Abovetopsecret.com focuses on ""alternative news"" and information ""not covered by the mainstream media,"" Allin said. He noted that all the postings attributed to Erad3 originated in Loughner's hometown of Tucson. Those messages from Erad3 -- riddled with grammatical errors -- often became the object of ridicule, scorn or sympathy from other contributors. ""The ranting about proof, (your) inability to make a coherent sentence gives you away red handed,"" one person wrote. ""It won't be long (until) you have been banned once again."" Unlike some of his posts as Dare on the Earth Empires site, the comments from Erad3 on didn't mention violence. But they do reflect a strong urge to break free of any restraints -- real or imagined -- imposed by government officials. CNN's Mia Aquino contributed to this report.","NEW: Website used by Loughner says it is ""absolutely horrified"" by violence .

"Washington (CNN) -- Two federal judicial sources say they expect attorneys for accused Tucson shooter Jared Lee Loughner to ask that any trial be moved out of Arizona, possibly to San Diego, but the Justice Department indicated Monday it would opposed a move . The sources said they expect the defense will make a formal motion in coming weeks to move court proceedings to a neighboring jurisdiction because of pre-trial publicity. ""Federal law dictates these offenses be tried in the district (Arizona),"" Justice Department spokeswoman Jessica Smith said. ""The Justice Department is moving forward in a manner consistent with the law, and will oppose any change of venue motions."" Earlier, federal sources said that whether to support an out-of-state change of venue, a move that has happened rarely in recent years, appeared to be an ongoing point of disagreement within the Justice Department. A trial also could be held in Arizona outside of Tucson, those sources said. There are federal courthouses in Phoenix, Flagstaff, and Yuma. A final decision would be made by the new chief judge of the federal courts in Arizona, Roslyn Silver. The 1994 Clinton appointee to the federal bench has taken over for Judge John Roll, one of the six victims killed in the January 8 shooting that also left U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, D-Arizona, seriously wounded. Federal sources say Silver -- if asked to move the trial -- would consult with officials of the 9th Circuit, the federal judicial region that includes nine Western states, including Arizona. San Diego, which is in the Southern District of California, is being considered since San Diego-based federal Judge Larry Burns has been assigned to preside over the Loughner case. The next court appearance for the suspect is January 24 in Phoenix, where Burns will preside. Several members of Loughner's current defense team -- including Judy Clarke -- also are based there. San Diego is about 410 miles from Tucson. All federal judges in Arizona have recused themselves from the case. Sources say other possible out-of-state options for a trial would be Los Angeles, or Las Vegas. Federal prosecutors have the discretion to object to any proposed move out of state for any criminal trial, but they would have no authority to block it. The prosecution of the suspects in the 1996 Oklahoma City, bombing was moved to Denver at the defense's request. But the 1982 federal trial of John Hinckley, the man who attempted to kill President Ronald Reagan, was held in Washington, where the shootings took place. He was found not guilty by reason of insanity. There are no clear guidelines on moving criminal trials out of a state or region. Judges in such cases have wide measure of discretion to decide, legal experts say. Federal judicial sources said they expect any consideration on the Arizona venue question to be several months off, at least. Those sources offered no guidance on when any trial would begin, saying such decisions are subject to a range of pre-trial motions that can be filed by both the government and defense. CNN's Carol Cratty contributed to this report.","NEW: The Justice Department will oppose a change of venue, a spokeswoman says .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- During the current economic crisis, high-flying women have been overlooked for promotion, according to a study out Tuesday. At the upper level of management, business is still dominated by men. The study, by U.S. nonprofit research group Catalyst, surveyed 873 MBA alumni who graduated between 1996 and 2007, asking how their careers had fared between November 2007 and June 2009. The results showed that overall, male and female MBAs have proved resilient to the recession and have fared equally well in the U.S., Canada and Asia, with 31 percent of surveyed women reporting that they had been promoted during that time period, compared to 36 percent of men. However in Europe, just 26 per cent of women were promoted, compared with 44 percent of men, according to the study published in the Harvard Business Review. According to the Harvard Business Review, of the U.S. Fortune 500 companies only two per cent of the CEOs are women, and only 15 per cent of the seats on their boards of directors are held by women. Professor Susan Vinnicombe is the director of the Center for International Women Business Leaders at Cranfield University School of Management in England. She told CNN that while it isn't clear why the figures for Europe in particular show such a gender discrepancy, it reflects discrimination faced by women business leaders in general.

""There is a whole stream of research of male and female MBAs that systematically shows the more senior they get the bigger the disparities in salaries and promotion,"" she said. ""Immediately after the MBA -- at the mid level -- women do quite well, but as they progress upwards the disparities emerge and get wider. That's not just for MBAs, it's the function of men and women in the workforce in general."" When it comes to the top tier, women worldwide were much more likely than men to lose their jobs, with 19 percent of female senior executives losing their jobs, compared with six per cent of men. Eleanor Tabi Haller-Jorden, General Manager of Catalyst Europe told CNN that the discrepancy is probably not the result of the current economic malaise. ""These figures reflect what has been a challenge in Europe for a number years,"" she said. ""The talent pipeline in Europe is clearly not as robust for women. This study indicates that by and large this is not directly related to the economic crisis, but it may have magnified the discrepancy."" Haller-Jorden cites European corporate culture, perpetuation of gender-based stereotypes, exclusion of women from informal networks and a lack of role models as reasons behind the discrepancy. Cranfield University produces what it calls the ""Female FTSE Index,"" showing the percentage of female directors in Britain's top 100 companies. Vinnicombe says that in the last 10 years the number of female directors has hardly improved, increasing from seven per cent to just 11 percent. Vinnicombe adds that she has found anecdotal evidence that a number of senior women in the British banking sector have chosen to leave their jobs, rather than work in a ""high pressure, highly controlling"" work environment brought about by the economic crisis. The Catalyst study also shows that many MBAs aren't letting the economic crisis get in the way of career advancement. Overall, 34 percent of respondents had received a promotion and 35 percent made a lateral move. ""The data almost indicates business as usual, in highly unusual times for business,"" Haller-Jorden told CNN. The common perception might be that given the current economic uncertainty, employees would choose to play it safe rather than chance their luck in a volatile job market, but the study found that MBAs have been willing to risk career moves, with 20 percent of respondents changing jobs, 14 percent relocating and four percent starting their own business. Haller-Jorden said that MBAs represent ""high-potential employees"" who tend to be entrepreneurial and show a high level of initiative. She added that these individuals tend to be opportunistic when it comes to their careers, seeking out new developmental opportunities, exploring lateral moves, looking at options around relocating, and choosing other employment opportunities to make sure they aren't negatively impacted by recession. ""The results are sobering for a corporate sector which may have assumed that people would be grateful to have a job and wouldn't necessarily be exploring other options,"" she said. ""For companies to rest on their laurels and assume they don't need to worry about retention is a mistake.""","Study: High-flying women are missing out on promotion .

"(CNN) -- Florida millionaire John Goodman was found guilty Friday after being accused of driving drunk, hitting another vehicle and running it off the road into a canal, where its driver was later found dead in his submerged car. Goodman, 48, was found guilty on the two counts he was charged with. The first was DUI manslaughter and failure to render aid. The second was vehicular homicide and failure to give information to authorities or aid. The Palm Beach County jury reached its verdict after about 5Â½ hours of deliberation, following closing arguments Thursday afternoon. A sentencing hearing is set for April 30, with Goodman potentially facing 11Â½ to 30 years in prison. Until then, Circuit Judge Jeffrey Colbath revoked Goodman's bond and ordered that he be detained by authorities. The victim's mother, Lili Wilson, thanked the jury after the verdict and took solace in her belief that ""justice has been served."" ""I'm always going to miss my son. He was the most wonderful,"" she said, choking up at the thought of her son. ""I will always cherish his memories. And now, coming from me and the rest of the family and his friends, it's time for the healing process to begin."" The incident occurred early the morning of February 12, 2010, when Goodman was driving his black Bentley convertible in Wellington, Florida, ""at a high rate of speed while intoxicated,"" according to a probable cause affidavit. Goodman failed to halt at a stop sign, where the other driver -- Scott Wilson -- didn't have a stop sign and had the right of way, the affidavit said. The two men's vehicles collided, causing Wilson's car to go over a bank and roll over into a canal. ""After the collision occurred, Goodman made no attempt to look for Wilson's vehicle and fled the scene of the collision on foot,"" according to the affidavit from the Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office. ""Goodman left the Bentley GTC at the scene ... and left Scott Wilson to drown in the canal, belted in the driver seat of his vehicle."" A pair of tests taken three hours later showed Goodman's blood-alcohol content level was .177% and .178% -- and, based on those findings, a state toxicologist extrapolated that he was closer to a .20% or .23% at the time of the crash, more than three times Florida's legal limit. Prosecutor Sherri Collins further argued that Goodman could have saved Wilson's life had he gone after him after the crash rather than walk away. ""He called his friend, and she had to talk him into calling 911,"" Collins said during closing arguments Thursday. ""That is absolutely failure to render aid, that is absolutely failure to give information, that is absolutely not informing the authorities. ""If the defendant had rendered aid, Scott Wilson would have lived."" Goodman himself testified earlier in the trial, claiming he was ""absolutely not"" intoxicated when he left the second of two establishments he'd gone to that night. He blamed a malfunction with his vehicle for his failure to stop and the fact he hit Wilson's car. ""I began to apply my brakes, and the car did not seem to be stopping as easily as I was used to,"" he said on the stand. ""I continued to apply the brakes, I slowed before the stop sign and ... took my foot off the brake. And that's the last thing I remember."" His lawyer, Roy Black, argued that the blood-alcohol readings don't jibe with eyewitness testimony, saying that people saw him have three drinks and not the 20 he would have needed for such a high reading. And Black said the observations that Goodman's reactions appeared slow after the crash, that he had trouble gauging where he was and that he seemed confused were ""consistent with the symptoms of suffering a concussion."" After Friday's verdict, Assistant State Attorney Ellen Roberts said she suspected the jury ""saw through the defense experts,"" who she said ""just weren't real credible"" and offered ""bizarre"" theories. ""(Jury members) were very careful, they gave it a lot of thought, they went over a lot of evidence, and I think that they probably returned the only verdict that they could,"" Roberts told reporters. In addition to his role in the fatal crash and the subsequent trial, Goodman made headlines a few months ago when he legally adopted Heather Colby Hutchins -- his ""42-year-old girlfriend"" -- according to a court order issued in late January. That court order was written by Dade County Circuit Judge Glenn Kelley in response to a motion filed by Wilson's relatives. They are suing Goodman -- as well as the International Polo Club Palm Beach, which he founded -- for punitive damages tied to Wilson's death in the crash. The adoption of Hutchins made her eligible for money from a trust fund created for Goodman's children. The court previously noted that any money from this trust fund ""may not be considered a part of the net worth, or the financial resources, of Mr. Goodman for purposes of assessing punitive damages,"" the order said. The judge, in his order, granted the plaintiffs' motion to get more information on the adoption. He also said that Hutchins' ""interest in the children's trust may be considered in connection with defendant John Goodman's financial resources.""","NEW: Prosecutor: Defense experts weren't ""credible"" and had ""bizarre"" theories .

"Atlanta, Georgia (CNN) -- The little girl paused, then answered my questions: ""I'm 7."" ""Second grade."" Her hair was in braided pigtails. She wore a fancy dress. The girl had taken a seat in the folding chair next to mine after guards led another small group into the brightly lit room. We were in the post-security visitation area of the Stewart Detention Center, a privately run federal immigration facility in south Georgia. Behind us was a plain wall. In front were five sparse booths, open to the room, offering little privacy. Each booth had a chair and a large black telephone. Thick glass separated the booths from men who milled about on the other side. The men wore different colored jumpsuits: some blue, some orange, some red. Like the older woman, an aunt perhaps, who accompanied her into the room, the little girl to my right was visibly nervous. This was her first trip to the detention center. I told the girl about my own second-grader in an effort to get her mind off our surroundings. I'm quite certain I failed. After several minutes, a man in his late 20s sat down on the other side of the glass. He picked up a phone. The little girl walked up, studied another phone for a moment, and carefully raised it to the side of her head. Her greeting was straightforward: ""Hi, Daddy."" I couldn't hear what her father said in reply. I could see his wistful smile, though, and tears rolling down his cheeks. * * * . Every day, our immigration laws are breaking apart families of many citizens living in the United States. It's good news that, as a bipartisan group of U.S. senators seeks consensus on a plan for comprehensive immigration reform, one focus is on so-called ""family reunification"" preferences in our law. The senators are debating whether, and to what extent, our immigration policies should give priority to admitting family members of immigrant citizens -- their spouses, children and siblings -- still living abroad. But while family reunification is an important consideration, that issue avoids the larger point dramatized at the Stewart Detention Center about the harmful impact of U.S. immigration policy on families already here. More than 1.5 million unauthorized immigrants have been removed from the United States since President Obama took office in 2009, according to the federal government's statistics. Approximately 410,000 were removed last year alone. These numbers present an important question: Who are the immigrants we are deporting? Yes, some are dangerous criminals who need to be arrested, prosecuted and removed through deportation. Living in the United States without legal status does not, however, amount to criminality. The Supreme Court noted this last year when it wrote, ""As a general rule, it is not a crime for a removable alien to remain present in the United States."" Overstaying a visa, for example, is a civil violation and not a criminal one. The offenses that can trigger incarceration at detention centers like the one I visited recently include traffic violations such as driving without a valid license. This may seem like a matter of semantics to some, but incarcerating nonviolent immigrants carries real costs to the country and to the immigrants' family members who are, in many cases, U.S. citizens. Many present-day immigrants live among us in what researchers call ""mixed status"" households. Approximately 9 million people live in these modern American families that include both citizens and unauthorized immigrants. The result is that U.S.-citizen family members are frequently left behind when immigrants are deported. Contrary to popular belief, marriage to a U.S. citizen does not automatically confer legal status on unauthorized immigrants. While marriage can provide a pathway to legal residency, that path is often long and can be overrun with bureaucratic pit stops. In many instances, our laws require immigrant spouses to return to their home countries and remain there for as long as 10 years before reunification is permitted. These extended bars to re-entry apply, for example, to Mexican nationals who arrived in this country after 2001 without authorization even if they are married to a U.S. citizen. In that way, our current immigration laws give some U.S. citizens a distressing choice: Either extended separation from their immediate families or extended separation from this country. An emerging bipartisan consensus acknowledges that our immigration laws are broken and need to be reformed, in a comprehensive way, at the federal level. As Washington tackles this issue, we should acknowledge that reform can benefit more than the immigrants living among us. It can benefit American children who attend school with our kids, American men who share pews at our churches, and American women sitting beside us in office cubicles, by keeping their families together. Done right, immigration reform can strengthen our economy, uphold our values and preserve the family units of many U.S. citizens. * * * . Before entering the Stewart Detention Center, all visitors must fill out paperwork disclosing their immigration status. I didn't see the form of the little girl I met in the visitation room, of course, or ask the question as we chatted briefly. Given her family's willingness to bring her inside the barbed wire gates of the facility, however, it's safe to assume that she is a native-born citizen. She's as American as my grandfather, who grew up on Missouri farmland in the early 1900s, and who spoke nothing but German at home until the start of World War I. As American as my four children. The little girl was among many U.S. citizens who visit family member inmates at the detention center. On the day of my visit, at the other end of the room, a woman in her 40s sat in the corner booth. She saved up gas money and drove more than 300 miles for this chance to have a one-hour visit with her husband. Born and raised in western North Carolina, she lives on land that was owned by her father, and her father's father before him. She met her husband in a thrift store in her hometown. They fell in love. In the visitation room, the woman held a phone and spoke to her husband in Spanglish with a country twang. What she wanted most that day was the chance to touch his hand, just for a moment, through the glass. That was a chance she didn't get. Without changes to our federal immigration laws, more husbands and fathers, and wives and mothers, of American citizens will be deported. More American children will be raised outside the presence of a parent's love and financial support. And more Americans -- like the woman I saw pressing the palm of her hand against cold glass in a detention center booth -- may not have the chance to touch their spouses again. At least not in our country. At least not anytime soon. The current immigration system does not make our nation, or our families, stronger. We can do better. We can reform our immigration laws in a way that brings hardworking people out of the shadows and keeps families together. That is, or at least should be, the American way.

"London (CNN) -- With the prospect of more surgery ahead and under the shadow of Taliban threats, courageous teen activist Malala Yousafzai was recovering at her temporary home Friday after being discharged from a British hospital. In an attack that propelled her to global recognition, Malala was targeted in Pakistan by Taliban gunmen for speaking out in favor of education for Pakistani girls. She was left with life-threatening head and neck wounds. Now, almost three months later, she's on the mend but far from fully recovered. Doctors plan to perform cranial reconstructive surgery on her within the next month, replacing a shattered portion of skull with either her own bone or a titanium plate. The hospital released a photo to the news media showing a half-smiling Malala waving to photographers wearing a tan, gray and black scarf. Photos: Malala and the women of Pakistan . Video footage also showed her walking along a hospital corridor, her hand clasped in that of a nurse, waving goodbye to staff at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham -- her home for nearly three months. The transformation from images released immediately after Malala was admitted on October 15 -- which showed her face bruised and a breathing tube in place -- is dramatic. Former British Prime Minister Gordon Brown and his wife welcomed her progress Friday, saying on Twitter: ""Good news that Malala is well enough to leave hospital. We wish her well as her recovery continues with her family."" ""Malala is a strong young woman and has worked hard with the people caring for her to make excellent progress in her recovery, said Dr. Dave Rosser, the medical director of the University Hospitals Birmingham who's overseen her care. ""Following discussions with Malala and her medical team, we decided that she would benefit from being at home with her parents and two brothers."" As she recovers with her family at a house in the West Midlands, Pakistan's consulate in Birmingham has hired Malala's father as an education attache. Her parents and younger brothers, Khushal and Atul, traveled to England in the fall to be with her as she goes through the long rehabilitation process. Ziauddin Yousafzai will function as head of the consulate's education section for three years, the Pakistani government said. His job could be extended for two additional years. iReport: Your messages for Malala . The 15-year-old became an international symbol of courage after she was shot by Taliban gunmen last fall for her crusade about girls going to school. She had blogged fearlessly about girls' education and accused the Taliban of thriving on ignorance. The Taliban forbid girls in the classroom and have threatened to kill anyone who defies them. Pakistan's Malala: Global symbol, but still just a kid . Malala was in a school van in the area on October 9 when the gunmen stopped the vehicle and demanded that other girls tell them who was Malala. They identified her. Malala was then shot, as were two other girls who survived the attack with lesser injuries. Malala was left in a critical condition, with her father later describing her survival as a miracle. When he left Pakistan to join his daughter, Ziauddin Yousafzai told reporters he intended to return to his native country as soon as she had recovered. It is not clear whether his appointment will mean the entire family stays long term. At the time of his daughter's shooting, he ran a school in Pakistan's conservative Swat Valley that kept its doors open to girls -- in defiance of the Taliban. Watch: Who are the Pakistani Taliban? The attack on Malala prompted outrage and wide outpourings of support, in Pakistan and overseas. But even as anger about her shooting intensified, the Taliban issued a statement online saying that if Malala lived, they'd come after her again. Interior Minister Rehman Malik promised government protection if the schoolgirl does return to Pakistan. Pakistani authorities are paying for her medical care in Britain. Since her shooting, Malala has become an international figure. She was selected as runner-up for Time magazine's Person of the Year for 2012. CNN and Time are owned by Time Warner Inc.

"(CNN) -- Doctors treating Arizona Rep. Gabrielle Giffords have scheduled a Friday morning news conference to provide an update on her progress. Giffords, who was shot in the head in an attack outside a Tucson, Arizona, supermarket on January 8, has been recuperating at TIRR Memorial Hermann rehabilitation hospital in Houston. She was moved to the facility in late January from the University Medical Center in Tucson, Arizona. ""Two months after her injury, the congresswoman continues to improve,"" the Houston hospital said in a statement sent late Wednesday night. Six people were killed in the incident; Giffords was among 13 injured. Authorities have said they believe Giffords was targeted. On Wednesday, a federal judge in Arizona entered ""not guilty"" pleas on behalf of Jared Lee Loughner, the 22-year-old Arizona man facing 49 counts -- including murder and attempted murder -- related to the shooting. Judge Larry Burns also scheduled a May 25 competency hearing for Loughner, and attorneys on both sides will be allowed to hire their own experts to evaluate Loughner's competency to stand trial.","Giffords is recuperating at a rehabilitation hospital in Houston .

"(CNN) -- You're an Olympic champion and you've gone out at the top of your game -- so what next? Gold medal winner Victoria Pendleton is contemplating a future path which is being followed by many young people in her native Great Britain, and indeed around the world ... work experience. While the cyclist -- one of the official faces of London 2012 alongside fellow golden girl Jessica Ennis -- is not exactly short of lucrative endorsement deals to tide her over in these times of economic uncertainty, she told CNN she has no idea what she is going to do next. ""I'm going to take some time out just to work out what, because obviously I've spent my whole life turning left at speed. I think I need time to try lots of different things to find out what I enjoy, what I might be good at -- I don't really know,"" said Pendleton, who won silver in her final race in a GB kit. Interactive: See inside the Olympic velodrome venue . ""I'm going to use the contacts that I've made through my success in cycling and just do loads of work experience to start with and then just see where it goes. ""My only concern is not being able to find something that I can be equally as successful at. Obviously you can't win Olympic gold medals for every aspect of life, but I just want to be good at something -- I just want to be really good at something, that's all I want."" Wiggins makes history as Britain wins first golds at London 2012 . Cycling has been Pendleton's life, and her success and good looks have made her a regular in glossy men's magazines and a big draw for advertisers, but she says she's glad her competitive days are now behind her. ""It was just an absolute relief; I will never have to do that ever again. Going into the home Olympics as the Olympic champion and being named as one of the poster girls of the Games, people were much more aware of me as an athlete and my profile because I was marked as one of the potential gold medalists,"" the 31-year-old said. ""So it was difficult, it was really difficult to handle the pressure at times, and the expectation. So I wouldn't do it ever again! ""I think if the Olympics were in any other country in the world I would have retired after Beijing. I was looking at continuing for another four years past where I'd kind of decided I'd perhaps had enough already. ""Four years is a long time to be living in this process, going towards a home Games -- it's a long time to be stuck in that kind of bubble."" Hoy wins fifth gold after disqualifications mar women's team sprint . Pendleton was unable to retain her sprint title from Beijing 2008, but bounced back from a disqualification in her opening event -- the team sprint -- to claim gold in the keirin. ""Of course I'm sad that I couldn't take away two gold medals. Retrospectively standing here, I won a gold and silver medal at the Olympic Games; I'm really pleased with that! It's history already. Just move on and enjoy it really,"" she said. Pendleton was beaten in the two-woman sprint final by Anna Meares after having her win in the first ride ruled out, as the Australian reversed their podium placings from four years ago. ""Anna and I have had a really fantastic rivalry over the past six years and I think I'm a better sprinter because of her influence -- and I'm sure she feels likewise,"" she said. ""We've pushed each other on. If she hadn't had been there I might not have achieved the level that I had. It'd be hard to push to find another rivalry like it, especially in women's sprinting. I think we did really push the boundaries there."" Hoy becomes Britain's greatest Olympian after taking sixth gold . Pendleton, who has also won nine world titles, hopes that British cycling can continue its recent dominance. ""We were lucky enough to have significant funding from UK Sport and The Lottery in the beginning because we had been successful and won the occasional medal through the likes of Chris Boardman, Jason Queally, Chris Hoy, and it set the program up to develop and improve,"" she said. ""Success brings success and I think that's slightly coincidental almost, but then it's created a kind of momentum that we've just been rolling with ever since."" The hard work has paid off, and Pendleton can now reap the rewards -- whatever she decides to do next. ""All the best things in life come through hard work and sacrifice. Easy wins don't mean as much,"" she said. ""It's the ones that take the hard work and the effort, tolerance, the sacrifice, and the commitment, all the tough things, they're the ones that you really remember and that really count.""","Victoria Pendleton is stepping into the unknown following end of her cycling career .

"Tucson, Arizona (CNN) -- A bag that is believed to belong to Arizona shooting suspect Jared Lee Loughner contains the same kind of ammunition as was used in Saturday's massacre, the Pima County Sheriff's Department said Thursday. ""We got ammunition in there and it matches the type used in the incident,"" department bureau chief Richard Kastigar told CNN's ""John King USA."" Kastigar said that other items in the bag ""tell us that there is a relationship between what's in the bag, what happened Saturday, what his movements were leading up to that time."" Kastigar would not elaborate on what else was in the bag but said ""it gives us some indication to where (Loughner) was and what he was doing."" The bag, discovered on Thursday, has been transferred to FBI custody for further analysis, according to Pima County Sheriff's Department spokesman Jason Ogan. Police say Loughner's father, Randy, recalled that his son was carrying a black bag the morning of the shooting that left six people dead and another 13 wounded. The bag was the subject of an argument with his father just hours before the attack, according to Pima County Sheriff's Department Capt. Chris Nanos. The bag was found when a teenager walking his dog spotted it in a ""wash,"" or dry river bed, near where Loughner's family lives on Thursday morning, Nanos said. The teen then turned it over to a neighbor, who called police, Nanos said, adding that ""We certainly believe this is the bag."" But two law enforcement sources said Thursday that a Qwest Communications worker turned over the bag. One of the sources said a teenager approached a Quest technician with the bag and that the Quest employee contacted police, remaining in the area as investigators searched the scene. ""Qwest is working with law enforcement during the ongoing investigation,"" the company said in a statement Thursday. On Wednesday, Kastigar said Loughner was carrying the bag early Saturday when he had a brief discussion with his father in the Loughners' front yard. ""The father asked him questions similar to 'What are you doing? What is that?' and Jared mumbled something back to his dad, and his dad said he didn't understand what was said,"" Kastigar said. ""It was unintelligible, and then Jared left."" The elder Loughner got in his vehicle and tried to follow his son, but could not find him, he said. The bag will be tested for DNA, fingerprints, hair -- anything that might link it to Loughner. Investigators also likely will show it to Randy Loughner to see if he recognizes it, Nanos added. Several boxes of 9mm ammunition and receipts were found in the bag, a law enforcement source said Thursday. The source did not indicate where the receipts were from, but CNN has previously reported that a law enforcement source said Loughner purchased ammunition at a Walmart store. ""There are other things in the bag, but I'm not going to discuss the specifics,"" Kastigar said Thursday. ""We need to substantiate through others who might have been involved with what is in the bag how (things) got there."" Investigators believe Loughner spent the night at a Motel 6 the evening before the shooting, Nanos said. Authorities would not say how they discovered that information, but say they recovered a credit card from Loughner after the shooting. The processing of the crime scene was complete Thursday morning, authorities said, and cleanup efforts were under way before the shopping center reopened to the public. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, whom police said was the target of the shooting, remains in critical condition, but her doctors have been pleased with her progress. Loughner, 22, appeared in a Phoenix federal courtroom Monday to formally hear the charges against him -- including two counts of murder, two counts of attempted murder and one count of attempting to kill a member of Congress. He is now in federal custody. On Wednesday, Kastigar said Loughner had previous contacts with law enforcement, but none so alarming that authorities were concerned about what he might do. Speculation that law enforcement had enough information about Loughner to stop the shooting is ""completely untrue,"" Kastigar told CNN's ""John King USA."" ""I couldn't underscore that more."" ""The events that led up to what happened Saturday as they relate to law enforcement contact really do not add up in their totality to anything that would cause a police officer to say. 'This guy is going to go out there and shoot 20 people.' There's nothing there,"" Kastigar said. The law enforcement contacts included episodes of underage drinking and possessing drug paraphernalia, which Kastigar described as ""very minor occurrences or interactions with law enforcement."" Kastigar also said investigators had found no evidence Loughner followed up on suggestions from Pima College officials that he seek mental health help for behavioral problems. Pima County on Thursday released records saying that Loughner visited the Rio Nuevo One Stop career center in September, but was asked to leave because he was filming with a video camera and refused to turn it off despite being asked repeatedly. ""He pulled a crumpled copy of the Constitution out of his pocket and waved it at me, saying it was his right,"" a staffer's report on the incident said. Loughner's former community college also released records showing that he frightened fellow students and acted oddly in incidents throughout 2010. Pima Community College ultimately suspended him. His history at the college included an incident in February in which he reacted strangely to a poem read in one of his classes and made comments about abortion, wars and killing people. Two months later, a library staffer reported he was making loud noises at the computer. Also, a teacher reported he became ""very hostile"" after being told his grade in a Pilates class would be a B. The incidents and disruptions continued into fall, the records said, and college officials became concerned about Loughner's mental health. After an incident in September, a police officer delivered a suspension letter to him and recounted the events that had taken place. When the officer was finished, according to the report, Loughner responded, ""I realize now that this is all a scam."" On Wednesday, the 9th Circuit Court designated a district judge in California to hear Loughner's federal case. Judge Larry Burns is a 2003 Bush appointee serving in the U.S. District Court for Southern California, based in San Diego. The next scheduled federal hearing in the case is January 24 in Phoenix. All federal judges in Arizona have recused themselves from hearing the case. The chief federal judge in Arizona -- Judge John Roll of Tucson -- was among those killed in the Saturday shooting. Mark Hart, spokesman for the Arizona Game and Fish Department, said Loughner was stopped by an officer for running a red light at 7:30 a.m. on the day of the shooting. He was given a verbal warning and released. Kastigar added that investigators are now certain that Loughner acted alone. A ""person of interest"" they had been seeking identified himself to police. He turned out to be a taxi driver who dropped off the suspect at the shopping center, Kastigar said. CNN's Bill Mears and Paul Vercammen contributed to this report.","NEW: Qwest Communications worker contacted police about bag, sources say .

"(CNN) -- Craig Sonner and Hal Uhrig have viewed courtrooms from both the prosecution and the defense table. Until Tuesday, the two attorneys -- who have focused solely on criminal defense in recent years -- comprised the legal team representing George Zimmerman, a neighborhood watch volunteer in Sanford, Florida, who ignited a firestorm of controversy when he shot and killed 17-year-old Trayvon Martin in February. But while the two insist they believe and support Zimmerman's claim that he shot the teen in self-defense, they said Tuesday they could no longer claim to represent him, as they had lost contact with him. Prosecutor to make announcement soon in Martin case . Of the two, Uhrig is likely more familiar with the media. He has served as a legal analyst for Fox 35 News, an Orlando television station. In July 2010, he hosted an online chat on the Fox 35 website for viewers about the Casey Anthony murder trial. ""Regardless of what the jury decides in this case, there will be controversy,"" he told one viewer. ""We may never get the truth, but we will get a verdict."" He signed off the chat with, ""Got to close out and go to earn a living."" Opinion: Let a jury decide on Trayvon Martin case . In the chat, Uhrig praises both Judge Belvin Perry, who presided over the trial, and Cheney Mason, one of Anthony's defense attorneys. The name of Jose Baez, Anthony's lead defense counsel, is not mentioned. But Wednesday, told that Baez and another high-profile defense attorney, Mark Geragos, were among the attorneys who criticized the news conference the two held regarding Zimmerman -- and also that Baez suggested they had violated attorney-client privilege -- Uhrig denied any violation. ""I checked the list of opinions who I treasure,"" Uhrig said, referring to Geragos and Baez. ""They're not on the list."" Uhrig's career began at the Gainesville, Florida, police department, where he worked full-time while attending law school at the University of Florida in the early 1970s. He was a sergeant by the time he earned his law degree in 1974, according to his biography on the website of his current firm, The Defense Group. After he graduated from law school, Uhrig served as general counsel and legal adviser to the Orange County Sheriff's Office for four years, and as a police legal adviser to 10 central Florida law enforcement agencies, the biography said. He was also vice president of the Central Florida Criminal Justice Council. He then moved to the Florida attorney general's office, where he prosecuted cases in the RICO (Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations) and organized crime section in 1980. He later served as a public defender in the 9th Judicial Circuit and joined the law firm of Cotter, Uhrig and Valerino, near Orlando. His profile notes that he was board certified in family law during that time as well. For the past 12 years, the profile says, Uhrig has been a managing member of an attorney group he founded, The Defense Group. According to its website, the firm limits its practice ""to the defense of DUI and other criminal charges in the state and federal courts of Florida, and to the closely related representation in domestic and repeat violence injunction proceedings."" ""Please do not rely on war stories from friends when making legal decisions that could affect your future,"" The Defense Group website cautions. ""Many times a loved one calls our office frantically inquiring about an attorney for a stubborn family member who was convinced that his/her case would be dropped only to find out that charges were filed and the prosecutor is seeking jail time."" The firm says it does not list prior case results on its site ""because we value our clients' privacy and hold the attorney-client privilege in the highest regard."" His profile also notes that Uhrig was lead counsel in the nation's first four trials involving DNA evidence, attended the FBI National Academy in Quantico, Virginia, and did post-doctoral work at Case Western University in public safety law. Under ""activities and societies"" on his profile, Uhrig writes: ""Too busy with a wife, children and full time job for 'societies' or extra activities."" Sonner, meanwhile, earned his undergraduate degree in civil engineering from Tennessee Technology University and his law degree from Ohio Northern University. He became a member of the Florida Bar in 2001. ""Craig devotes 100% of his practice to criminal defense,"" his website says. ""As a former prosecutor for Seminole County State Attorney's office, he understands and uses his knowledge of the entire legal process to protect and defend your rights."" As a prosecutor, according to the site, he participated in ""thousands of criminal cases -- from filing decisions, plea offer negotiations and arguing motions to the discovery process, jury selection and participation in jury trials. ""Many people are intimidated by the court system and do not fully understand their rights,"" the site says. ""Craig has witnessed people standing alone in courtrooms before judges and prosecutors, accepting plea offers because they did not have anyone on their side to explain their rights or the consequences of their plea."" According to his website, Sonner defends clients facing many types of charges, including felonies, DUIs, Internet fraud, health care fraud, insurance fraud, mortgage fraud, sex crimes, homicide and drug charges. He maintains membership in a number of professional associations. Since the two began speaking for Zimmerman, a Hispanic man, in recent weeks, they have vehemently denied he is a racist, despite allegations by Martin's family that he racially profiled the African-American teen, calling 911 to report a suspicious person prior to the shooting. The case has drawn thousands of protesters to Sanford and sparked demonstrations nationwide, demanding Zimmerman's arrest. Meet Angela Corey: The case's tough, controversial prosecutor . Even as late as Wednesday, while saying he no longer can represent Zimmerman, Uhrig hinted that there is more to the case than has been publicly disclosed. A special prosecutor is deciding whether Zimmerman should face charges in Martin's death. ""We believe there's information and evidence in the possession of the prosecutor, the investigators, the police department, the (Florida) Department of Law Enforcement that if publicly known, might change some of the course of public opinion,"" Uhrig told CNN. ""We're not at liberty to disclose (it). We don't have possession of it. What little we know might disclose a confidence as to where we learned about it, and (I'm) simply not going to go there.""","Both Craig Sonner and Hal Uhrig are former prosecutors .

"Perugia, Italy (CNN) -- In a ruling read to a tension-filled courtroom, an Italian jury on Monday cleared Amanda Knox of murder and other charges, nearly four years after she was arrested on suspicion of having killed her roommate in this picturesque Italian university town. There was an audible gasp in the courtroom as the verdict was read, then an eruption of emotion, prompting the judge to call for silence. Knox herself was nearly hysterical, according to CNN's Matthew Chance, and had to be assisted out of the courtroom by two people. The jury evidently believed Knox's impassioned final statement to the court, delivered in a voice trembling with emotion. ""I am not what they say I am -- perverse, violent. ... I haven't murdered. I haven't raped. I haven't stolen,"" Knox said in the most important speech of her life. Her co-defendant, Raffaele Sollecito, was also cleared of involvement in the 2007 death of Meredith Kercher, a British exchange student and Knox's roommate in Perugia. ""We're thankful that Amanda's nightmare is over,"" Knox's sister, Deanna, said on the courthouse steps, getting a roar of approval from the crowd. ""She suffered for four years for a crime she did not commit."" Deanna Knox thanked her sister's attorneys and ""people who took the time to research the case and could see that Amanda and Raffaele were innocent,"" for supporting the Knox family. The same jury, however, upheld Knox's conviction on the charge of defamation against Patrick Lumumba, an early suspect in the case. She had accused club owner Lumumba of killing Kercher. Lumumba was arrested, but released after his alibi checked out. He later sued Knox, winning 40,000 euros ($54,000) in damages. Knox was sentenced Monday to three years on the defamation charge , but received credit for the years she has already spent behind bars, said her attorney, Carlo Dalla Vedova. ""We're satisfied with the decision of the court,"" Dalla Vedova told CNN. ""We were expecting the rectification of this mistake."" He said Knox is ready to go home, but has said she will return to Italy. ""She always confirmed she was a friend of Meredith,"" he said. As the verdict was read in court, Kercher's family grew emotional. ""We respect the decision of the judges but we do not understand how the decision of the first trial could be so radically overturned,"" the Kerchers said in a statement, issued through a journalist close to the family, after returning to their hotel on Monday. ""We still trust the Italian judicial system and hope that the truth will eventually emerge."" Some of those gathered outside were unhappy with the ruling, shouting ""Shame! Shame!"" Among those outside the court were a handful of college-age Italians and Americans, including two young Italian men who told CNN they disagreed with the ruling and believe Knox and Sollecito are guilty. One of them, Frederico Finali, 18, is a student at the same university Kercher attended. Finali said he is studying international communications. ""I am very upset with Italian justice,"" said a woman who gave her name as Veronica and said she is a fourth-year law student in Perugia. The legal process, she said, had gone ""very, very bad."" ""This family needs some justice,"" she said of the Kerchers, ""and more important, you know, the real truth of the story."" She said a majority of those in Perugia ""absolutely"" agree with her, adding, ""I'm not satisfied."" Knox and her defense team succeeded in overturning a conviction handed down two years ago by a different jury, which found her and Sollecito guilty of killing of Kercher, who was sexually assaulted and her throat slashed. ""I am innocent,"" Knox said Monday. ""Raffaele is innocent."" Sollecito put his claim simply in his own closing statement before Knox spoke. ""I have never hurt anybody,"" he said. As he concluded, he dramatically removed his plastic ""Free Amanda and Raffaele"" bracelet, saying: ""I have never taken it off since it was given to me. ... I think now is the moment to take it off."" His voice almost inaudible, he concluded, ""I hope this is part of history and that Amanda and I have a future."" Knox was expected to go back to jail to complete her release paperwork and gather her belongings before leaving for the last time. As one van pulled up outside the prison, the sound of cheering could be heard from inside. A few minutes later, a black van pulled away from the prison and was chased by photographers. Rocco Girlanda, a member of the Italian parliament who became an advocate for Knox, confirmed that Knox was inside. ""Amanda was incredibly happy,"" Girlanda said, adding that Knox will leave Tuesday for Seattle, her hometown. She was greeted at the prison by cheers and shouts of ""well done,"" prompting her to jump for joy, he said. Knox was headed to meet her parents nearby after leaving the prison, he said. ""Her first desire is to lie down on a green field."" In Washington, State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said, ""The United States appreciates the careful consideration of this matter within the Italian judicial system."" The U.S. Embassy in Rome will continue to provide consular assistance to Knox and her family, she said. ""I am glad that the appeals court gave Amanda the fair hearing that she deserves,"" said U.S. Sen. Maria Cantwell, D-Washington, who had helped push for the appeal, in a statement. ""All countries must live up to their international commitments to provide a fair trial by an impartial tribunal to those accused of crimes. ""Amanda's parents, family and friends have been through an incredible ordeal,"" Cantwell said. ""We are all thankful that she will be free to return to Seattle as soon as possible."" Sollecito's father, Francesco, told CNN in a brief conversation the family was driving towards home. ""We are now starting to talk,"" he said. ""I can't say more. Raffaele is very spaced out."" Knox's lawyer Luciano Ghirga reminded the jury Monday that they had to be convinced ""beyond a reasonable doubt"" that Knox and Sollecito were guilty if they were to uphold the conviction. At least four members of the jury -- composed of six members of the public and two judges -- must have concluded they did, indeed, have doubts about her conviction. A majority ruling was all that was needed to throw out the conviction, with a tie favoring the defense. The actual vote will remain secret, but the main judge, Claudio Pratillo Hellman, will file a statement explaining the jury's reasoning within 90 days of the ruling. Knox and Sollecito were convicted of murder, sexual assault and related crimes related to Kercher's death in December 2009. A third man, drifter Rudy Guede, was convicted separately of involvement in the killing and is serving 16 years. In the appeal, lawyers for Knox and Sollecito picked apart DNA evidence that played a role in the original conviction. Part of the original prosecution case was based on DNA evidence found on a knife and on a bra clasp belonging to Kercher. During the appeal, experts for the two sides battled over whether the DNA evidence was reliable. They also fought over the character of Knox. The lawyer for a man falsely accused of the crime called Knox ""Lucifer-like, demonic, Satanic,"" while Sollecito defense counsel Giulia Bongiorno insisted that, like the buxom cartoon temptress Jessica Rabbit in the movie ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit?"" Knox is not bad, just ""drawn that way."" Knox herself acknowledged the debate Monday in her closing statement. ""People always ask 'who is Amanda Knox?'"" she said. ""I am the same person I was four years ago. ... The only thing that now separates me from four years ago is my suffering. ""In four years, I've lost my friends in the most terrible and unexplainable way. My trust in the authorities and the police has been damaged. I had to face charges that were totally unfair, without any basis. And I am paying with my life for something I haven't done."" Knox was 20 and Kercher was 21 years old, studying at Perugia's university for foreign students, when Kercher's semi-naked body was found in the house they shared. Sollecito, 23 at the time, was Knox's boyfriend, studying computer science at another university in Perugia. Either side can appeal this court's ruling to Italy's High Court, but such an appeal would be on narrow technical grounds only. CNN's Hada Messia, Antonia Mortensen, Matthew Chance, Paula Newton and Chelsea J. Carter and journalist Livia Borghese contributed to this report.","Knox's first desire, friend says, is to ""lie down on a green field""

"(CNN) -- Federal prosecutors are pushing to force the Arizona man accused of fatally gunning down six people and wounding 13 others, including U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, to submit a handwriting sample -- a request that he, thus far, has refused. A motion was filed Monday, out of the office of U.S. Attorney Dennis Burke in Arizona, asking the court to compel Jared Lee Loughner to write out something so authorities can view his writing style. The government wants the sample to compare with handwritten notes found in Loughner's residence that include mentions of Giffords ""as well as references to guns and bullets,"" according to a court document. It says he has resisted such requests to date, ""arguing that the court lacks authority"" to force him to provide a sample. ""There being no other avenue to obtain the defendant's handwriting exemplar, the government now seeks an order to compel,"" prosecutors wrote in the motion. Last Thursday, a federal grand jury returned a new indictment against Loughner in which he is charged on 49 counts -- including murder and attempted murder -- related to the shooting outside a Tucson supermarket in January. The 22-year-old Tucson man was indicted on three counts of attempted murder, including one alleging that he tried to kill Giffords with a Glock semiautomatic handgun during the event she was hosting for constituents. After being shot through the head, the congresswoman is now undergoing rehabilitation at a medical facility in Houston, Texas. The new indictment -- which supersedes an earlier one, which had fewer charges -- adds murder charges connected to the deaths of John M. Roll, a federal district judge, and Gabriel M. Zimmerman, a staff member for Giffords. Loughner also faces charges in the deaths of Dorothy J. Morris, Phyllis C. Schneck, Dorwan C. Stoddard, and a child, referred to in the indictment as C-T G. Nine-year-old Christina-Taylor Green was among those killed in the shooting. Autopsy reports released Monday showed that Zimmerman, Schneck and Stoddard suffered fatal head wounds, while the three others were shot in the chest. Loughner could face a death sentence if convicted, Burke said last week, although prosecutors have not said yet whether they will seek the death penalty. Loughner, who is being held by authorities in Arizona, is expected to be arraigned on the new charges Wednesday in Tucson, the district attorney's office said.","Jared Loughner is refusing the government's request for a writing sample .

"(CNN) -- Menthol cigarettes are no more harmful than regular cigarettes, tobacco industry representatives argued Thursday as a federal advisory panel opened a two-day meeting to consider whether to ban the sale of those cigarettes. Menthol cigarettes, which account for one-quarter of the cigarettes sold in the United States, have been under scrutiny by public health officials and public health watchdog groups.  Critics claim the flavor makes them more addictive and denounce the marketing campaigns that they say target menthol cigarettes specifically at minority smokers. According to a study published in Nicotine and Tobacco Research, menthol cigarettes are favored by three-quarters of African-American smokers. But Leonard Jones, director of marketing at Lorillard Tobacco Company, said that ""ethnicity does not play a role"" in marketing strategies for the Newport menthol cigarette.  ""We don't collect or retain information on ethnicity in our marketing data base."" Representatives from Phillip Morris USA, R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company and Lorillard Tobacco Company plan to present scientific evidence that they say shows menthol cigarettes are no more harmful than non-menthol cigarettes.  The meeting, moderated by the Food and Drug Administration's Center for Tobacco Products, is being held in Rockville, Maryland. The 12-member federal advisory panel, which is in charge of overseeing the implementation of the 2009 Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act, is scheduled to makes recommendations on menthol cigarettes by March 23, 2011.  The committee includes three non-voting members representing the tobacco industry. The panel could decide to ban the sale of menthol cigarettes or order that the levels of flavoring in them be reduced. There is no evidence showing higher numbers of deaths among menthol cigarette smokers than among non-menthol cigarette smokers, said Jane Lewis of Altria Client Services, which represents Phillip Morris USA.  And ""at the end, that's what matters,"" she added. The meeting is being streamed live on the FDA's website.  According to the agenda, participants will discuss the characterization of menthol cigarettes, clinical effects of menthol, biomarkers of disease risk, marketing data, and population effects.","NEW: ""Ethnicity does not play a role"" in marketing strategies, tobacco official says .

"(CNN) -- Maria Sharapova overpowered Sara Errani to win the French Open final at Roland Garros for the first time and complete a career grand slam. The 2012 tournament's surprise package, Italian Errani never came up with an answer to Sharapova's strategy of power and unerring ball placement as the Russian produced 37 winner to secure a 6-3 6-3 victory. As Sharapova motored into a 4-0 lead in the opening set the final looked as it might be over in the blink of an eye, but Errani got her toe in the match by breaking Sharapova's serve to win the fifth game. Errani, who is ranked 23rd in the world, showed plenty of grit to save two set points in the eighth game, but when a third set point came up in the following game Sharapova ruthlessly converted. Italy's Errani refused to capitulate in the second set, but was never able to threaten the Russian's dominance. As well as strength, Sharapova's quickness of feet was a feature of an impressive performance, notably when she sprinted to reach an Errani drop shot, winning the point to take a 4-1 lead. Errani saved two match points in a game that the Italian produced a couple of the deftest drop shots you could wish for, but the Italian's resistance was finally ended when the Russian converted her third championship point. It was the 25-year-old Russian's first grand slam title since she won the Australian Open in 2008. Since then Sharapova's career has been hampered by serious shoulder injuries that forced her into a long rehab, but her winning form at Roland Garros will also see the Russian move above Belorussian Victoria Azarenka to take the No. 1 ranking slot on Monday. Saturday's victory ensured Sharapova became just the 10th female player to complete a career grand slam to emulate the the likes of greats such as Steffi Graf, Martina Navratilova, Billie Jean King, Chris Evert and Serena Williams. The Russian won her first grand slam title at Wimbledon eight years ago, before going on to win the US Open in 2006 and then then Australian Open four years ago. ""It's the most incredible feeling,"" said Sharapova after her win in Paris. ""I'm so happy. I've worked so hard for this -- it took a lot to get to this stage and even more to win it. There are so many tough days where you feel like giving up, but you don't. It's been such a journey to get to this stage again."" If Errani's impressive performances at Roland Garros -- featuring wins over two former champions and two members of the top 10 -- might not have had a fairytale ending, those rankings will provide some consolation for the Italian as she enters the top 10 for the first time. ""I don't feel like top 10, but I will be top 10, and it's incredible for me,"" said Errani, who made only only hit 11 unforced errors during the final. ""I really can't believe it. I'm so happy for everything right now."" Victor Sharapova made a point of praising Errani's achievement in reaching the final. ""What an amazing tournament,"" said the Russian. ""I've watched you play the last two weeks and the way you've performed. And the way you played today was extremely difficult for me. I know it was our first meeting, and I hope we play many more times.""","Maria Sharapova beats Sara Errani to win French Open final .

"San Diego (CNN) -- A federal judge on Wednesday rejected a motion by lawyers for Jared Lee Loughner to prevent prison doctors from forcibly medicating the Arizona shooting suspect. ""I defer to medical judgement,"" U.S. District Judge Larry Alan Burns said in ruling that prison doctors were within their rights to force Loughner to take mind-altering psychotropic drugs against his will. ""I have no reason to disagree with the doctors here."" Burns, who conducted the hearing in his San Diego court, also ordered that sensitive medical and legal documents relating to Loughner's treatment for mental illness remain sealed. Loughner has already started receiving the powerful drugs, Wednesday's hearing revealed. Lawyers representing Loughner contend that forcing him to take the drugs against his will violates his rights. Authorities at the U.S. Medical Center for Federal Prisoners in Springfield, Missouri, where Loughner is being held, should have tried lesser restraints such as milder tranquilizers, argued Reuben Camper Cahn, one of Loughner's lawyers. Prison authorities ""allowed competing objectives to interfere"" by ordering the psychotropic drugs, which are for treating mental illness, in an effort to restore Loughner to mental competency so he can stand trial -- as desired by law enforcement and judicial systems, Cahn asserted. Prosecutors responded Tuesday that prison officials acted properly in ordering the medication, which they said was necessary for Loughner to control his mental illness. ""This is a person who is a ticking time bomb,"" proscecutor Wallace Kleindienst said. ""He's lunged at his defense counsel and spits at her."" Loughner, 22, is charged in the January mass shooting in which six people were killed and 13 wounded, including Democratic U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, in front of a Safeway grocery story in Tucson, Arizona. A federal judge ruled last month that Loughner was not competent to stand trial, and he was sent to the federal facility in Springfield. Burns, at the beginning of Wednesday's hearing, suggested the federal court in Missouri, where Loughner is being held, might be where medical decisions should be made. ""If he had a bad toothache, complained about treatment, would he come to me?"" Burns asked. In their emergency motion on June 24 to halt the forced medication, Loughner's lawyers said prison officials held a deficient hearing process and used faulty reasoning in deciding to drug Loughner against his will. For example, Loughner had no attorney present at the June 14 hearing, the lawyers said in their motion, and officials failed to state the drug and dosage he should receive. According to the emergency motion, authorities had earlier assessed Loughner as dangerous because of incidents before his transfer to the Springfield prison: He threw a chair against a door and spat at an attorney. However, the reasoning by prison officials in Springfield for deciding to administer the drugs was to treat Loughner's mental illness, rather than to subdue any dangerous behavior, the motion noted. Prosecutors argued in their response that Loughner received a proper administrative hearing on the matter, and the medication prescribed was necessary to prevent him from being a danger to himself and others. CNN's Bill Mears contributed to this report.","NEW: The judge says he sees no reason to disagree with prison doctors .

"(CNN) -- Bizarre and suicidal actions of Arizona shooting suspect Jared Lee Loughner have pushed a federal appeals panel to reverse an earlier decision and allow authorities to force him to take anti-psychotic medication. The three-judge panel for the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals based in San Francisco had ruled on July 12 that Loughner can refuse anti-psychotic medication. But since that ruling, Loughner, who has been diagnosed as schizophrenic, has deteriorated, prosecutors said. He's had screaming and crying fits that last hours, he has harmed himself and claims that the radio was inserting thoughts into his head, prosecutors said. Loughner has also expressed ""regret for the circumstances that led to his arrest,"" prosecutors wrote in court documents. When asked whether he had thoughts of harming himself, Loughner said: ""I want to die. Give me the injection. Kill me now,"" court documents said. Authorities placed Loughner on suicide watch and prosecutors argued in court documents that he would continue to deteriorate and could become more dangerous if he continues to refuse the drugs. The judges released a ruling Friday that allowed authorities to force him to take the medication. Loughner is charged with killing six people -- including the chief federal judge of Arizona, John Roll -- in a supermarket parking lot in Tucson, Arizona, on January 8. Among the 13 people wounded was U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, D-Arizona, who was shot in the head. The suspect is being held in a federal mental hospital after an earlier court ruling found him incompetent to stand trial. His attorneys have argued that forcing him to take strong drugs violates his rights. Administering the anti-psychotic drugs was more about restoring his competency for trial rather than dealing with his behavior, his attorneys said in court filings.","He has crying fits and has asked to die, prosecutors said .

"(EW.com) -- After 10 years, Discovery Channel is ending ""American Chopper."" The Teutuls are going to build their final bikes on the network next month. One of Discovery's most popular programs, ""American Chopper"" helped pioneer the ""docusoap"" reality genre and inspired a surge of gear-head shows.

The Teutuls have given us really innovative bike builds and real drama since 2002. We wish both Orange County Choppers and Paul Junior Designs the best."" The series had a simple format â€” a father and son building custom motorcycles amid frequent infighting. Yet nothing about the show's colorful history has been straightforward. ""American Chopper"" has changed networks, switched names and was previously canceled, only to rise again. ""I have mixed emotions,"" executive producer Craig Piligian tells EW.com. ""It's had a great run. We had a lot of ups and downs. There's been so much that's happened to this family over the last 10 years. We've seen them grow to a huge motorcycle shop.

""American Chopper"" premiered as a Discovery Channel special in 2002, then launched as a regular series a few months later. In 2008, Discovery moved the show to its sister channel TLC. A couple years passed, then behind-the-scenes warring between Senior and Junior prompted TLC to outright cancel the show. Donald Trump gives 'American Chopper' duo advice .

I'm really proud they were so open and honest."" Paul Senior and Junior's spirited attitudes helped make the show engaging for fans, but could also make things difficult behind the scenes. At one point when shooting the current final season, Piligian fired Junior and kicked him off the set. ""It's a very tumultuous relationship, not only between the father and son, but between us as well,"" Piligian says. ""Junior and I would have it out, and at one point awhile back, I said, 'We're done with you.'"" The two reconciled and Junior returned to work shortly thereafter.

"Kot Chutta, Pakistan (CNN) -- From behind the steel bars of his jail cell, Muhammad Ismail described with uncanny ease how he shot and killed his wife, his mother-in-law, and sister-in-law. ""The first shot hit the side of her body,"" Ismail said. ""I left her there and went next door and killed my wife's mother and sister. I made sure they were all dead. Then I locked the door and left the house."" Without any apparent regret, Ismail said he would do it again. ""I am proud of what I did. That's why I turned myself over to the police."" Ismail's confession to the triple-murder that took place last February in a village in central Pakistan is a rare and chilling first-hand account of a so-called ""honor"" killing -- the murder of women who are usually accused of dishonoring their families by being unfaithful or disobedient. British court convicts parents of murder in ""honor"" killing . Ismail accused his wife of eight months of repeatedly flirting with other men and spending long hours away from home. ""My wife never made me happy,"" said the 20-year-old who played drums in a traditional Pakistani wedding band before his arrest. ""She was like a prostitute. She never took care of me."" The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan reported 943 women were ""killed in the name of honor"" in Pakistan last year, an increase of more than 100 from 2010. Rights groups blame the increase in ""honor"" murders partly on what they call an ineffective justice system in Pakistan that too often allows killers to go unpunished. Despite his videotaped confession to CNN and an earlier confession to police, prosecutors say Ismail can soon be a free man if his victims' family agrees to accept compensation for the killings. Receiving blood money is an option for victims in many conservative Muslim societies under the Islamic principal that mercy is more noble than revenge. But women's rights activists complain that in patriarchal societies like Pakistan, ""honor"" killers regularly bully and threaten the female victim's family into accepting blood money. ""When it comes to the crime we have a natural reaction of shock and horror, but when we see the justice system not work, our heart breaks,"" said legal advisor and rights activist Bushra Syed. According to human rights lawyer Zia Ahmed Awan, victims' families in Pakistan are also at a disadvantage because ""honor"" killings often take place in male-dominated communities where women are often viewed as property with few rights to defend themselves and little access to legal aid. ""In parts of the country there is hardly any legal help for women,"" Awan said. ""This crime is growing because the courts and laws are not responding to the cries for help."" Awan said police, lawmakers and judges in these communities are too often either corrupt or lack the proper resources and power to investigate and prosecute crimes. Instead they regularly defer to a traditional system of justice where powerful tribal leaders and male heads of families rule on disputes, he said. In 1999 Awan set up Pakistan's first hotline for female victims of abuse and families who lost loved ones to ""honor"" murders. He called it the Madadgar Help Center.

"(CNN) -- Tokyo on Saturday formally announced its bid to host the 2020 Summer Olympics, despite setbacks in earlier tries. Tokyo governor Shintaro Ishihara announced the city's candidacy at a ceremony marking the 100th anniversary of the Japanese Olympic Committee and the Japan Sports Association. ""As far as we try for hosting Olympic game, we should have nothing but victory,"" he said. Tokyo previously hosted the Olympics in 1964, and the 1972 and 1998 Winter Games were also hosted by Japan, in Sapporo and Nagano, respectively. Most recently, Tokyo led an unsuccessful bid to host the 2016 Olympics, which will be held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Another recent failed Japanese bid was for Osaka to host the 2008 Olympics. Ishihara said that the Olympic Games would help Japan recover from the deadly March 11 earthquake and tsunami and make it a better country, the public broadcaster NHK reported. International Olympic Committee president Jacques Rogge was in attendance at the Tokyo event. Extensive preparations will be the key to a winning Japanese bid, Ishihara said. The IOC will select the host of the 2020 Games in September 2013.

"San Diego, California (CNN) -- A U.S. District Court judge declined Friday to release the findings from authorities' search of accused gunman Jared Lee Loughner's family home because a federal investigation is still ongoing and a grand jury is preparing an indictment. Loughner, 22, is accused of shooting U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, D-Arizona, and 18 other people on January 8, six of them fatally. An indictment could be ready by March 9, when two Arizona media outlets seeking the results of search warrants could renew their request, Judge Larry Burns said. In another matter relating to Loughner, Burns said he would not make a ruling on a defense request to withhold two new mug shots of Loughner taken by the U.S. Marshals Service after his arrest in the mass shootings in Tucson, Arizona. Loughner, who is being held by authorities in Arizona, did not appear in court Friday. The marshals service attempt to release the two mug shots was based on a 6th Circuit Court ruling, and the judge said he would let media outlets in the 6th Circuit Court region -- Kentucky, Michigan, Ohio and Tennesse -- seek the release of the two mug shots. Burns was assigned to the Loughner case by the 9th Circuit Court, where he's based, after Arizona federal judges recused themselves from the case because their state's chief federal judge was allegedly killed by Loughner. The 9th Circuit Court region includes California and Arizona. Loughner's public defenders sought to bar the release of the mug shots after the U.S. Marshals Service planned to release them on February 7 under Freedom of Information Act requests made by 15 individuals, four of them within the 6th Circuit, according to court records and the judge. But the judge commented that the mug shots of Loughner don't appear to jeopardize his right to a fair trial. ""I do not see a serious threat to his ability to get a fair trial if the two mug shots are released,"" Burns said. Federal prosecutors and Loughner's public defender have opposed requests to make public the photos, asserting Loughner's privacy rights and his 6th Amendment guarantee for a fair trial. The mug shot of a smirking Loughner that has widely appeared in the media was one taken by Pima County, Arizona, authorities after the shootings. Federal prosecutors also opposed publicly disclosing the inventory of their search of Loughner's house after the shooting, arguing in court papers that the media doesn't have a right to search warrant materials until a formal indictment against Loughner is made. But David Bodney, an attorney for two Arizona media outlets seeking the search warrant results, said federal officials have already released selective details of the search and added that the First Amendment and federal law provide ""a strong presumptive right of public access"" to the records. But Bodney's arguments failed to convince the judge. ""I think his rulings were very understandable based on the information we heard for the first time ... namely there is still an investigation,"" Bodney said after Friday's hearing. The publishing company for the Arizona Republic newspaper and the Phoenix television station KPNX Broadcasting Co. were seeking to make public the results -- or returns -- of at least two search warrants executed in the Loughner case, one issued by a Pima County judge on the day of the shootings and another issued January 12. Loughner is accused of shooting Giffords in the head at a ""Congress on Your Corner"" event on January 8 at a Tucson grocery store and then shooting 18 other people, six of them fatally. The dead included Giffords staffer Gabe Zimmerman and U.S. District Judge John Roll. Giffords is recovering in a Houston rehabilitation hospital. Loughner is charged with one count of attempting to assassinate Giffords and two counts of attempted murder in the shootings of Giffords staffers Pamela Simon and Ron Barber. Loughner had also faced two murder charges in the deaths of Roll and Zimmerman, but in a procedural maneuver last week, prosecutors temporarily dropped those two charges and plan to bring them back under a superseding indictment that is expected to include other charges as well. Prosecutors intend to present a superseding indictment containing the murder charges at the next status hearing in the case on March 9, said Robbie Sherwood, a spokesman for the U.S. attorney's office in Phoenix. The federal government will prosecute Loughner before state prosecutors pursue a criminal case against him, federal and state prosecutors said this month. Friday's hearing was held in San Diego because presiding Judge Burns and Loughner's federal public defender, Judy Clarke, are based in the city. Burns is a 2003 Bush appointee serving in the U.S. District Court for Southern California in San Diego. Last month, Burns entered not guilty pleas on behalf of Loughner, who declined to tell the court his plea during an arraignment. At that hearing, prosecutors said they had turned over hours of videos taken off Loughner's home computer to the defense. Two federal judicial sources told CNN last month they expect Loughner's attorneys to ask that any trial be moved out of Arizona, possibly to San Diego, but the Justice Department indicated it would oppose a move. The sources said they expect the defense to make a formal motion in coming weeks to move court proceedings to a neighboring jurisdiction because of pretrial publicity. Earlier last month, federal sources said that whether to support an out-of-state change of venue, a move that has happened rarely in recent years, appeared to be an ongoing point of disagreement within the Justice Department. A trial also could be held in Arizona outside Tucson, those sources said. There are federal courthouses in Phoenix, Flagstaff and Yuma. A final decision will be made by Roslyn Silver, the new chief judge of the federal courts in Arizona. The 1994 Clinton appointee to the federal bench has taken over for Roll. Federal sources said Silver -- if asked to move the trial -- would consult with officials of the 9th Circuit, the federal judicial region that comprises nine Western states.","NEW: Judge says he won't make a ruling on whether two new mug shots should be released .

"(CNN) -- Athletes competing at the 2012 Olympic Summer Games will face more scrutiny about banned substances after organizers said they will be carrying out more doping tests than in any previous Olympics. The London Organizing Committee of the Olympic Games (LOCOG) said Wednesday they plan to carry out about 5,000 blood and urine tests at the Games and about 1,200 tests at the Paralympics, which are held about two and a half weeks later. Organizers at the Beijing Olympics in 2008 carried out 3,667 blood and urine tests, according to Giselle Davies, a spokeswoman for the International Olympic Committee. ""We need to have a strong message that drug cheats are not welcome at the London Games,"" said Debbie Jevans, LOCOG's director of sport. LOCOG will be primarily responsible for the collection of samples and providing a laboratory to analyze them, a London spokeswoman said. The lab will be accredited by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA), which also runs an independent observer program at the Games. UK Anti-Doping, a non-departmental public body responsible for implementing national anti-doping policy, will be helping LOCOG with the testing. ""We are partnering with LOCOG to develop a comprehensive program of testing, athlete education, and training for anti-doping volunteers in the lead-up to, and during, the London 2012 Games,"" said Andy Parkinson, chief executive of UK Anti-Doping.","London 2012 Olympic athletes to face record number of drug tests.

"(CNN) -- U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords plans to attend the launch of the space shuttle Endeavour next month -- a little more than three months after she was shot in the head outside a Tucson, Arizona, supermarket -- her spokesman said. Giffords' husband, Capt. Mark Kelly, will command the shuttle. After spending the days after the shooting at his wife's hospital bedside, he decided in February that would continue his assignment as the mission commander. At the time, Giffords' spokesman C.J. Karamargin said the Arizona Democrat ""fully understands"" that her husband is flying the shuttle and supports his decision. ""I have every intention for her to be at the launch,"" Kelly said then. On Thursday, Karamargin said that Giffords is well enough to make the trip from Texas to Cape Canaveral, Florida. When asked when she will begin heading east for Florida, he said, ""We're not even there yet in the planning process."" According to NASA's website, the spacecraft is set to lift off at 7:48 p.m. on April 19 from Kennedy Space Center. It will be the final mission for the Endeavour, and the second-to-last one for the entire space shuttle fleet. Giffords has been at TIRR Memorial Hermann rehabilitation hospital in Houston -- not far from where Kelly does most of his training -- since January, when she was moved there from University Medical Center in Tucson. Doctors treating Giffords have scheduled a Friday-morning news conference to provide an update on her progress. ""Two months after her injury, the congresswoman continues to improve,"" the Houston hospital said late Wednesday night in a statement. Giffords was shot at a ""Congress on Your Corner"" event in the parking lot of Safeway grocery store in her hometown. Six people were killed in the incident. The congresswoman, who authorities say was the main target, was among 13 injured. On Wednesday, a federal judge in Arizona entered ""not guilty"" pleas on behalf of Jared Lee Loughner, a 22-year-old Arizona man who faces 49 counts -- including murder and attempted murder -- related to the shooting. Judge Larry Burns also scheduled a May 25 competency hearing for Loughner, and attorneys on both sides will be allowed to hire their own experts to evaluate Loughner's competency to stand trial. CNN's Danielle Dellorto contributed to this report.","Rep. Giffords plans to go to the shuttle Endeavour launch, her spokesman says .

"(CNN) -- Before Jared Lee Loughner allegedly opened fire on an Arizona congresswoman, police at an area college he had previously attended were put on alert to keep him off campus, according to e-mails obtained Monday by CNN. The e-mails, dated December 23 and December 28, show that campus police at Pima Community College were distributing photos of Loughner to staffers and night watchmen, adding patrols in an area of the campus they believed Loughner had visited and searching for videos he'd posted online. The Monday release of the e-mails came a day after an attorney for the college defended it in a CNN interview for not alerting outside law enforcement about Loughner before the January 8 shooting spree. The attack killed six people and injured 13 others, including U.S. Representative Gabrielle Giffords, R-Arizona, at a Tucson supermarket. Loughner did not have a record of criminal violence before the shootings. ""We don't report people simply because their behavior is odd and strange,"" the attorney, Alice Callison, said. ""He had made no specific threats against anyone here at the college or anyone else that we were aware of."" However, the e-mails obtained by CNN through the Arizona Open Records Act show that, before the shootings, Pima officials considered Loughner enough of a threat to bolster security in case he tried to revisit the campus. In October 2010, Loughner was suspended from Pima and told he could not return without undergoing a mental health evaluation to ensure he was not a danger to fellow students and faculty. Loughner's suspension occurred after he was reported five times to campus authorities for classroom outbursts. College authorities put out the alert after learning that Loughner may have revisited Pima after his suspension, video-recorded part of the campus and posted the recording online. ""In regards to Jared Loughner,"" wrote college Police Commander Manny A. Amado on December 28, ""I will have a photo of Jared copied and given to the swing shift crew and have them conduct more frequent checks of the Northwest Campus, to include the night roving CSO.  I will also have a copy given to the facilities crew."" Five days earlier, college police Sgt. Dan Simmons alerted others to a rambling text video Loughner had posted on YouTube. It was not the video containing footage of the campus. ""Haywood happened to find this on You Tube,"" Simmons wrote. ""More drivel from Jared Loughner. Doubt there is anything to it."" In another e-mail, a college official asked Amado if Loughner had contacted the school to set up an appointment and if ""the facilities guys"" have a photography to identify Loughner if he visited the campus after hours. Callison said it is campus policy not to report students without criminal histories to outside law enforcement. That policy, she said, has not changed since the January 8 shootings. ""We had a process in place,"" Callison said, ""and we dealt with this student in a reasonable fashion based on what we knew at the time.""","Arizona college police kept eye out for Loughner after suspension .

"(CNN) -- In his first weeks as leader of the world's most populous nation, China's new President Xi Jinping has made frequent reference to an emergent ""Chinese Dream,"" emphasizing prosperity, happiness, and a revitalized national ethos. No doubt economic growth and infrastructure have been common themes in China's national rhetoric. But as national pride rises in lockstep with economic growth, the added emphasis on a culturally based ""unity of purpose"" raises a new question: As China overcomes centuries of foreign intrusion and humiliation to emerge as a superpower, what will be the role of non-Chinese? China has become not only a global center of economic gravity, but also a demographic magnet. Historically, great empires have been ethnically diverse and racially inclusive, absorbing talent from all corners to drive collective success. In short, they have been melting pots. Xi Jinping: China's new boss a man with a dream . China's history has hardly been linear or peaceful when it comes to its inter-ethnic relations and openness to the outside world. Two thousand years ago, Buddhism came to China via the Silk Road, absorbing Central Asian monks and missionaries. The 13th century Silk Road traveler Marco Polo spent 17 years serving in the Yuan Dynasty court of Kublai Khan. But China has also sought to be left alone. The Great Wall was built and rebuilt many times since the Qin dynasty (221 BC) to fend off Mongol invasions. Were it not for the 19th century Opium Wars and perception of British and other Europeans' mercantile exploitation of the country for silver, it would have been even more difficult to unite its disparate regional power centers against ""foreign devils."" China continued to suffer foreign occupation, notably by the Japanese during World War II, but after its own civil war rapidly undertook a process of territorial consolidation. Its western expansion led to the pacification of diverse ethnicities, creating today's mÃ©lange of the dominant Han, but also Zhuang, Hui, Manchu, Uighur, Tibetan, Miao, Mongol, and other ethnic groups. Read more: China's workforce at a crossroads . Much of the country remained closed off, however, while Hong Kong and Macao remained foreign run. It was Deng Xiaoping who set the country on its present seemingly irreversible course of globalization. In the 1970s and 1980s, thousands of foreign investors and managers came to run factories taking advantage of China's enormous labor pool. The outsourcing of manufacturing to China brought capital, technology, and knowledge that the country needed. Now that China has become one of the most trade-dependent nations, openness is no longer an option. It is easier than ever to visit and reside in China, but do foreigners see themselves staying in China for a long time? And how ""Chinese"" can they become? America is used to being the land of opportunity for immigrants, but it is has also become a source of economic migrants, particularly since the financial crisis. Over 6 million Americans now reside abroad, the highest number ever recorded, and the proportion of Americans aged 18 to 24 who plan to move abroad has risen from 12 to 40% since 2007. Ever more young Americans are turning up in China, living cheap, learning Chinese, hustling for jobs, and diligently traveling Asia. At a lecture last year at Beijing's prestigious Tsinghua University, I heard from dozens of Westerners who turned down spots in MA programs in the U.S. and Europe in order to get a dual-language MA in China -- with guaranteed summer internships and great networking opportunities with multinationals and Chinese businesses. Across the board, young Westerners I have met in China came here on one-way tickets. Read more: Chinese companies 'rent' white foreigners . From executives in Hong Kong, Shanghai and Chongqing to diplomats and intellectuals in Beijing, China has become a country that scholars, journalists, and entrepreneurs are settling in for the long haul. Daniel Bell, a Canadian political philosopher and long-time China resident who lectures intellectual and Party elites in fluent Mandarin, points out that while China has become home to a global talent pool, with thousands of foreigners arriving each year with a great desire to learn about Chinese culture, ""there is no expectation that they will become 'real' Chinese."" No matter how well foreigners learn Chinese, they cannot dissolve their original cultural traits the way many immigrants in America do within just a single generation. Perhaps that is part of the appeal: if one can never be truly ""Chinese,"" then being in China is always exotic. No doubt, there are high-profile cases of Chinese fleeing their own country, from the blind dissident Chen Guangcheng to ultra-high net worth individuals parking cash abroad. Some expatriates who had devoted their own careers to China have also packed up and left, citing air pollution, lack of free press, and intimidation after speaking their minds. Companies fed up with the theft of their intellectual property now do not locate their most sensitive research and development operations in China. But still, the number of foreigners in China has crossed one million and continues to rise. Their presence has sparked debates about inclusion and xenophobia, welfare and generosity, democracy and free speech. Much like long-term residents of Dubai and Singapore, Chinese too blame migrants (both internal and foreign) for crowded streets and rising crime, but also realize that migrants are the ones who often collect the trash and do the laundry. They also help Chinese businesses reach the rest of the world more efficiently. Each year, more than 200,000 Middle Easterners travel to Yiwu, 200 miles west of Shanghai, to purchase wholesale goods for sale across the Arab world. Everything ""made in China"" is conveniently available in the city's giant International Trade Center expo halls. The city is now a major hub on the new Silk Road as China has risen to become the Middle East's largest trade partner. Higher up the value chain, Chinese in cosmopolitan Beijing and Shanghai also appreciate the role foreigners have played in the country's rise. As one Beijing native working for an American university put it, ""We admire foreigners because they represent advanced technology and management expertise; we can learn from them."" China has made the recruitment of the global ""best and brightest"" an official policy, and not just the ""sea turtles"" (hai gui) of whom more than 500,000 have returned after studying abroad, and now account for half of Chinese companies' launching on the U.S. stock exchange. Reversing brain drain is not enough. Recently the government has launched its own ""green card"" program (casually dubbed the ""red card""), granting permanent residency to growing numbers of foreigners. As a next generation of leaders with international educations rise in business and government, they are recruiting their talented classmates to come to China, pointing to a continuity of openness to foreign expertise. Much as China welcomed Jesuits in the 16th and 17th centuries that transferred scientific knowledge to the Ming and Qing dynasties, businessmen, scholars, scientists, and non-governmental organizations are welcome today if they help to improve productivity, innovation, supply chain standards, or bring affordable technology to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. For foreigners using China as a base, residency access is becoming like the Chinese RMB currency: flexible and convertible. But as with the currency, such liberalization takes time and careful management. To thrive, one must not only learn Mandarin but adopt some Chinese views, such as prizing social stability over rapid political reform. Chinese also don't want foreigners to get too native. According to one Chinese entrepreneur, ""just because you might learn Mandarin fluently, we don't like seeing Westerners haggling abrasively in restaurants and bazaars. These are Chinese habits, often crude ones, but when foreigners do them it comes across as exploitation, which we resent."" The foreign population of China won't rise over 1% for many years, a mere drop in the ocean of 1.4 billion people. And like Japan, China is a country where foreigners will never be considered locals even if they adopt local customs. Rather than a melting pot then, China is more of a salad bowl in which foreigners are a mere sprinkling of pepper. Still, foreigners are considered an essential part of achieving the ""Chinese Dream.""","Khanna: Everywhere you look in urban China, you see foreigners: traders, merchants, students .

"(CNN)  -- An Indianapolis girl may have been among the first victims of Mattel's magnet mishap at the center of Tuesday's recall of millions of dolls made in China. An employee removes Polly Pockets toys Tuesday, the same toy that sickened an Indianapolis girl. Paige Kostrzewski was 7 years old in July 2005 when she was playing with her new Polly Pocket toy, whose plastic clothes attached to the doll with magnets. When some of the magnets detached from some of the clothing, Paige placed two of them between her lips so that her hands would be free to affix the rest of the clothes, said her mother, Misty May. A few days later, the girl complained of abdominal pain, but May attributed it to the flu.  Watch what parents should look out for » . ""I never thought in a million years she'd swallowed a magnet,"" the 27-year-old mother of four told CNN in a telephone interview. But May's concern for her daughter soon heightened. ""When she started puking green, that's when I knew something wasn't right,"" she said. May took Paige to a hospital, where a scan revealed that two magnets -- each about the size of a watch battery -- had lodged in her small bowel.  See what toys have been recalled » . Surgery discovered the magnets had attached to each other, separated only by a thin piece of tissue, May said. ""She had ended up swallowing two of the magnets, and they had somehow connected together inside her intestine, which caused two holes -- punctures -- in her intestines, which caused everything to just seep into her body,"" May said. With the seepage came a massive infection. ""If I had waited a few more days, she would have died,"" May said doctors had told her. Paige, who will be 10 in November, required two weeks of hospitalization for treatment of her infection and return trips to the doctor every few weeks for months thereafter, May said. In all, the treatment cost about $40,000. ""I went straight to a lawyer,"" she added. Retained by the family, product-liability attorney Gordon Tabor filed suit, and Mattel settled for an amount he would not disclose. Mattel's CEO, Bob Eckert, said he would not discuss litigation. ""I bet he won't,"" Tabor told CNN. Last November, the 62-year-old toymaker voluntarily recalled 4.4 million Polly Pocket products, about 2.5 million of them in the United States. That recall was expanded Tuesday. May said the experience has moved her to alter her toy-buying habits. ""I inspect things more, and there's certain things now I won't allow them to play with no more -- nothing with magnets, nothing that I think is going to fall apart."" May faulted the company for not having recalled the products sooner. ""It should have been done two years ago, when my daughter almost died,"" she said. A representative of the U.S. Public Interest Research Group, a nonprofit consumer advocacy group in Washington, said Mattel should have had better safeguards in place. ""They should have never allowed it to happen in the first place,"" said Ed Mierzwinski, the organization's consumer program director. ""They have a responsibility to avoid recalls.""

"(CNN) -- Double Olympic gold medalist Haile Gebrselassie is swapping the track for the polls after announcing his intention to run for election to the Ethiopian parliament in 2015. Gebrselassie is one of the most celebrated track and field athletes of all time, dominating the 10,000 meter event by winning four consecutive World Championships titles over the distance between 1993 and 1999. Now he hopes to use his iconic status in his homeland to kick start his political career, a move he has long been expected to make. ""A lot of messages in the news about me going into politics,"" the 40-year-old, who clinched gold in 1996 and 2000, said on Twitter. ""Yes, I want to be in the parliament in 2015 to help my country to move forward."" If Gebrselassie does successfully make the transition into politics, he will be following in the footsteps of some other sport stars. Gebrselassie's fellow two-time gold medal winner Sebastian Coe served as a Member of Parliament in his native Britain between 1992 and 1997. Former middle distance runner Coe also served as chairman of the organizing committee's for last year's London 2012 Olympic Games. Manny Pacquiao, boxing's first and only eight-division world champion, has become a political heavyweight in the Philippines. The 34-year-old, known as the ""Pac Man"", was elected into the House of Representatives for the Sarangani province in May 2010. A host of famous football names have also forged successful political careers for themselves. Romario was a lethal striker who starred as Brazil won the World Cup in 1994. He is now an elected member of the Chamber of Deputies on the Brazilian Socialist Party ticket and has recently expressed concerns regarding the South American country's hosting of the 2014 World Cup. Romario has raised the issue of whether the money spent hosting football's biggest competition would be better spent on education.

"(CNN) -- San Francisco's public transit strike was in its third day Wednesday, with the financial toll so far likely to top $200 million, economists estimate. Negotiations between Bay Area Rapid Transit and union leaders stretched until nearly 3 a.m. Wednesday, CNN affiliate KGO reported. Progress was made, but no deal was reached. ""We decided we would make more progress if we get more sleep,"" said Josie Mooney, chief negotiator for the Service Employees International Union in the talks, according to KGO. The two sides returned to the table at 1 p.m. Wednesday, and California Gov. Jerry Brown appointed two new high-level mediators to handle negotiations, the station reported. About 400,000 daily commuters use BART. The Bay Area Council Economic Institute says its ""conservative estimate"" finds that lost worker productivity alone is costing the region at least $73 million a day. The loss of economic activity could add tens of millions of dollars to that figure, the council said. The strike is also having ""a costly environmental impact,"" the council said. ""Increased traffic congestion is generating almost 16 million pounds of carbon, and wasting almost 800,000 gallons of gas every day at a cost of almost $3.3 million."" BART planned limited charter bus service for those working on Independence Day in case no deal is reached Wednesday. Regardless of when the strike ends, BART said, it will still take about 18 hours for train service to resume. The dispute centers on pay and benefits. Unions asked for a 21% pay increase. BART initially offered to increase salaries by 4% over four years, but later proposed an 8% increase; that was on top of a 1% increase scheduled to go into effect Monday. Roxanne Sanchez, president of SEIU Local 1021, said workers are fed up. ""Years of layoffs have affected public safety and services. Crippling cuts have not just made our jobs more difficult, but put undue strain on our livelihoods, our families and our communities,"" she said in a written statement. ""We are sorry that the actions of ATU and SEIU have caused such a tremendous disruption to the people of the Bay Area,"" BART said in a statement Tuesday announcing ""no indication"" that employees would return to work Wednesday. ""We are working hard to bring a fair and responsible resolution to labor talks. BART is the nation's fifth-largest all-rail train system in the United States, with 44 stations in 26 cities that make up the Bay Area, according to the transit authority.

"(CNN) -- It's time mass worker casualties stopped seeming so commonplace. In April, a garment factory in Bangladesh collapsed, killing more than 1,100 people. The previous day, cracks had been spotted in the building's structure. ""Despite the danger, garment workers were told to report to work,"" CNNMoney reported. And on Monday, more than 100 people died in a fire at a poultry factory in northeastern China, not far from North Korea -- an area the Wall Street Journal says is known as ""the Iowa of China."" Sounds wholesome, huh? All but one of the gates to the burning building were locked during the blaze, trapping people inside, according to state and international media reports. What's arresting is that most China experts quoted on the disaster expressed little surprise. Many have compared this week's fire to a similar one at a toy factory in 1993, which killed 87 workers. In both cases, doors were locked. Workers trapped. ""(T)he lack of proper fire safety equipment, exits and training for workers are all too commonplace in China's factories,"" the China Labour Bulletin says in a news release. These events should ignite international outrage. ""What kind of country is this?"" Wang Shoufeng asked this week. CNN reporters found him outside the charred poultry plant. His wife was among the dead, and he was ""yelling at passing vehicles and demanding answers,"" the report says. Opinion: The bloodshed behind our cheap clothes . His screams must not go unheard -- both in China, a country that seems bent on profit at virtually any expense of human life; and in the West, where disasters like these can seem so far away, or so unthinkable, that they don't register in the public consciousness. There are many signs, however, that the China of today is not the China of 1993, when the toy factory fire made headlines. It's more difficult to hide in the age of social media, and Chinese citizens are becoming more critical of their government. That's clear in Wang's response and that of other victims' family members, who reportedly gathered at the site of the fire to protest and insist on information. Their questions -- Why were the doors locked? Why haven't we been able to see the bodies of our family members? -- should be answered. And I'll hold out hope they will be, if not by the government than by a crusading citizen. The situation reminds me of Chinese artist Ai Weiwei's project to name the child victims of a 2008 earthquake in southwest China. When the Chinese government wouldn't release the names, Ai set out to gather them independently. The result was a fitting tribute to the dead. A work of art. In addition to gathering the names, with the help of volunteers, Ai created a wall of children's backpacks in Germany. He called it ""Remembering."" The 9,000 backpacks, viewed from afar, spelled out this sentence, which reportedly was spoken by a family member of a child who was killed in the earthquake. ""She lived happily for seven years in this world."" The 1993 fire in China also spawned a hero: Yuying Chen. According to a post on ScienceBlogs, the woman was 15 when she survived the fire at a toy factory. She went on to become ""an internationally recognized human rights leader."" Will someone in China take up the cause of the new victims? In Bangladesh, too, there are signs the tragedy may lead to safer work conditions, but there is still much progress that needs to be made. At least 40 companies, including Abercrombie & Fitch, H&M and Calvin Klein have signed onto an agreement called the Accord on Fire and Building Safety in Bangladesh. The document envisions, quite reasonably, a world ""in which no worker needs to fear fires, building collapses, or other accidents that could be prevented with reasonable health and safety measures."" It requires safety checks and the like. So obviously everyone signed that, right? Nope. Walmart and the Gap are notable standouts, according to the International Labor Rights Forum, which is organizing protests of those U.S. companies. Walmart and Gap reportedly are working on standards of their own, which could yield progress but continues to draw criticism. Instead of following on these issues, U.S. companies should be leading the charge for enforceable and legally binding measures that will ensure the safety of workers in all countries. Their unwillingness to do so suggests that maybe they figure these tragedies, and their victims, will be forgotten soon enough. Prove them wrong. The opinions expressed in this column are solely those of John D. Sutter.","More than 100 people died this week at a poultry plant fire in China .

"(CNN) -- The Korean-American who has been held in North Korea since November entered the country on a valid tourist visa, a senior U.S. official told CNN on Monday. The U.S. State Department on Monday publicly called on the North to release Kenneth Bae on humanitarian grounds. Spokesman Patrick Ventrell told reporters that Swedish diplomats, who represent U.S. interests in North Korea because Washington has no diplomatic relations with the North, were able to visit Bae, a U.S. citizen, on Friday. Some Americans have previously crossed the border without a visa, either knowingly or by mistake, but in this case, the official said, ""This was somebody who was a tour operator who has been there in the past and has a visa to go to the North."" The official, who spoke on background because of the diplomatic sensitivity of the issue, says the State Department doesn't know the exact charges against Bae -- whom the North refers to by his Korean name, Pae Jun Ho -- and is trying to clarify the matter through the Swedish Embassy. Media reports have listed the charges as plotting to overthrow the government, which carry penalties including death or life imprisonment. ""In the past there have been many clear instances where American citizens are used as political bargaining chips, and our concern is that this individual not be used in this matter,"" the official added. North Korea plans to hold a trial against Bae, state media said Saturday, complicating tense relations between the North and the United States. Bae entered North Korea as a tourist on November 3, according to the Korean Central News Agency. According to the news agency, Bae confessed to an offense, but the KCNA did not say what it was. ""He will soon be taken to the Supreme Court of the DPRK to face judgment,"" the news agency said, using the official name of the country, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. The developments come amid tense relations between North Korea and South Korea and the United States. In recent weeks, the North has intensified threats against its neighbor and the United States. CNN's Elise Labott and Karen Smith contributed to this report.","Official says a U.S. citizen detained in North Korea had a valid visa .

"(CNN) -- In a world where people power appears to be gaining momentum, you could be forgiven for thinking this month's meeting of the rich and powerful in the Swiss ski resort of Davos is an anachronism. The World Economic Forum -- an informal meeting of executives, presidents, thinkers and stars -- once brokered history-changing encounters. Now critics say it is struggling for relevance at a time when the future is being shaped in the streets of Cairo or protest camps of Wall Street. This appears to be borne out by events of the past 12 months. Despite hosting intense meetings about Greece's debt crisis and hastily-convened talks about the evolving political situation in Egypt, the Forum's 2011 enclave seems to have little to show for itself. Davos's image problem is easy to quantify: It offers a haven for the capitalist world's elite at a time when social media has galvanized popular movements calling for greater democracy and a major rethink of the financial systems behind the global financial crisis. ""It is a very undemocratic meeting,"" said David Roth, president of JungsozialistInnen Schweiz (Swiss Young Socialists), who is helping to organize an ""Occupy Davos"" igloo camp in the icy streets beyond the Forum's heavily-guarded perimeter. ""It is a meeting for those who have created the crisis and they always have the same claims that, after being one of the reasons for the crisis, they think they are the solution to the crisis. We never get out of this because the same non-democratic people are making the decisions."" Those involved in the World Economic Forum are clearly not unaware of such viewpoints. This year's event is titled: ""The great transformation: shaping new models,"" and features debates on the future of capitalism, democracy, the eurozone and the Arab world. ""This is not one of the easiest environments for Davos, there is so much economic uncertainty, so much resentment towards bankers and business leaders generally,"" said Mark Malloch-Brown, a former U.N. deputy secretary general and adviser to Forum financial talks. But he and others insist that the five-day meeting can still play an important role in a turbulent world by offering lines of communication that bypass formal diplomacy to unite radically different perspectives. ""It is exactly these kinds of moments, where the official channels have clogged up in terms of finding solutions to the crisis both within Europe but more broadly at the global level, where Davos comes into its own,"" he added. Nevertheless, he warns, the chances of this year's Davos delegates mapping a route out of the problems such as the debt crisis threatening to tear apart the eurozone, are as slim as in 2011 when, he says, little in the way of concrete economic policy was formulated. ""To be honest this year I don't see any great international initiatives,"" he said. ""This is a very frightened, nervous and reactive global environment, so this is one of those years where Davos is much more about mood-taking; trying to find how intense or not the level of anxiety is in this strange environment, where so many of the formal business signals are going the wrong way."" Marco Magnani, a researcher in political economics at Harvard University appointed as a Forum young global leader, argues that in spite of its elitist nature, Davos offers diverse face-to-face encounters in an age when people are often sequestered behind computer screens. ""I don't think in those five days the world's problems get solved, but if people have good use of that time and opportunity they can prepare the ground to then have better communication with other folks and open communication channels,"" he said. ""To have a place where you can pretty much meet everyone in person and have a conversation -- that's very meaningful."" Ben Verwaayen, CEO of French telecoms giant Alcatel-Lucent and a Forum board member, also argues that although Davos ""is not a negotiation,"" it represents a fruitful cross-cultural trade of ideas rarely seen in the closeted worlds of politics, business or academia. Says Verwaayen, the failure of numerous crisis meetings held over the past 24 months by economists and European leaders to create a solution to the eurozone problem underscores the need for the alternative dialogues hosted by Davos. ""I would say it's more relevant than ever,"" he said.","Critics say the World Economic Forum meeting in Davos is struggling for relevance in the era of people power .
Forum regular Mark Malloch-Brown says many now resent business leaders who attend .
But board member Ben Verwaayen says Davos dialogue is relevant part of effort to solve global problems ."
"(CNN) -- On the same day terrorists took lives in Boston, Secretary of State John Kerry talked in Tokyo about another young life extinguished by an explosive device, Foreign Service Officer Anne Smedinghoff. ""A 25-year-old young woman, full of idealism, full of hopes, taking books to children in a school so they can learn, and wiped out by terrorism, by the worst kind of nihilistic nothing -- violence that doesn't stand for anything except killing people and stopping the future,"" Kerry said, talking of his decision to pay a condolence visit to her parents and vowing her death would not be in vain. ""We're not going to be deterred. We're going to be inspired. And we're going to use Anne's idealism as another motivation for the idealism that brings all of you to this effort in the first place. We can make this world better."" Only hours later came Boston, and more lives blown apart by explosive devices planted to deadly effect on a day that should have been a holiday. Bombs hit innocents right in the heart of a street celebration and were timed for the most lethal impact. Spectators killed. Babies injured. An 8-year-old boy, who had held a handmade sign calling for peace, dead. A young Boston woman full of promise extinguished before her 30th birthday. A young Chinese woman who chased her dream of education in Boston killed. Death clinging to the streets in a city that would have found the idea unthinkable even moments before. Carnage all around. Americans will be called upon in the coming days to do as so many families have before them: to pull themselves out of the swamp of their heartbreak and to push forward with life. To make certain that those who practice destruction and devastation do not achieve a win. To find the valor amid the annihilation and to force resilience to rise up against grief. As Kerry said, to be inspired by horror to ""make this world better,"" as Boston's first responders and a slew of marathon volunteers surely were. But it will not be easy. Facing down terror and resuming life is tough. Rebuilding after loss requires a particular kind of tenacity and a commitment to living that grief wants to smother. Many push forward to do honor to the memory of those they have lost. But they must remind themselves each step of the way that though it would be easier to succumb to loss they must instead choose life. Because otherwise their loved one's example would be in vain. As Boston struggled to reconcile itself with the re-emergence of terror, a series of bombs exploded across Iraq leaving death and maiming behind. People simply trying to make a flight at Baghdad's airport died when parked cars became explosives.  At least 42 were killed across the country. In Pakistan, a suicide bomber killed nine people who came out for an election rally. More than 50 were wounded. Across the world innocents are targeted and terror seizes the spotlight with little effort. All that is left to be done is to bear witness, bring perpetrators to justice and continue living. The opinions in this commentary are solely those of Gayle Lemmon.","Gayle Lemmon: Terror doesn't discriminate: People all over world died Monday .

"(CNN) -- This may be a week of skeptical glances. When I took the subway home on Monday night, after watching news that three people died and more than 100 were injured in a terror attack in Boston, I looked around at crowds and fellow passengers in Atlanta with an unfair twinge of suspicion. It's difficult not to let events like this impact your patterns of thinking. It's sometimes hard to do what The New Yorker's Hendrik Hertzberg suggests: to keep calm and carry on. That used to be easy, before Oklahoma City, where I'm from, and before 9/11. Then it was more difficult. And just when it seemed like ""terror"" was a word that we could use with a sense of distance and irony -- and a concept we watched play out in films like ""Zero Dark Thirty"" and not in our communities -- our collective sense of security threatened to evaporate again, after two explosions hit the finish line of the Boston Marathon. We are left searching for answers and perpetrators. Families are mourning those who died and praying for those who lost limbs and were severely injured. I think it's because of all this uncertainty and soul-searching that a quote from America's lullaby-voiced comforter, Mr. Rogers. bounced all over my Twitter feed on Monday afternoon, getting retweeted in various forms by thousands. ""I would see scary things in the news, my mother would say 'Look for the helpers. You will always find people who are helping.'"" Leave it to a former kids' TV host to give America its moral compass. iReport: Bostonians rush to support stranded visitors . Right now, as the authorities try to figure out who did this and why, what the rest of us can do is take a moment to focus on the humanity that followed the tragedy. Doing so will remind us that America is bigger and stronger than these events -- that we don't have to let fear change us as it has before. Jared Keller, a native Bostonian and director of social media for Bloomberg News, compiled a short but powerful list of the helpers in Boston. Among them were people who ran toward the site of the explosion -- rather than away from it -- to try to help the people who were injured. They were marathoners who ""kept running, all the way to Massachusetts General Hospital, to give blood"" after the blasts went off. They were, of course, the police officers and other first responders who were photographed in numerous courageous and selfless acts, including carrying this small person away from the scene. ""Many were fleeing,"" wrote David Abel from the Boston Globe, ""but many were running to the wounded. They ripped down the metal barriers separating the runners from spectators. Unsure of whether there would be another explosion, these strangers risked their lives to help other strangers, performing CPR, comforting those in shock, and carrying the wounded to the nearby medical tent."" Others protected each other during the explosion. Dr. Allan Panter treated victims at the site of the explosion, according to CNN's live blog. ""I saw at least six to seven people down next to me,"" he said. ""They protected me from the blast. One lady expired. One gentleman lost both his (lower) limbs."" They were runners who offered jackets to each other. And they included a photographer who walked through pools of blood to try to capture the horror and humanity of the scene, all while holding back tears of his own. Outside that northeastern city, they were technologists who scrambled to publish tools to help relatives find their loved ones and to help stranded visitors find a safe place to stay the night. They were joggers who hit the streets in their own neighborhoods even though the blast may have shaken them up. On Monday night, Dan Conley, Suffolk County's district attorney, took the microphone at a news conference and put words to these sentiments. ""It was a large and disturbing scene. Like each of you I am praying for the victims and their loved ones. It is a terrible, terrible day for them,"" he said. ""Seconds after those bombs went off we saw civilians running to help the victims right alongside members of the Boston Police Department and Boston EMS. And in the hours that followed police and medical personnel from across the region have sent dozens, maybe even hundreds, of volunteers to help us here in Boston. ""That's what Americans do in times of crisis. We come together and we help one another. Moments like these, terrible as they are, don't show our weakness, they show our strength."" That was true in Oklahoma City and New York. It was true in Norway, where people responded to a 2011 massacre by gathering around an Oslo courthouse to sing. And it's certainly true of Boston. ""Moments like this, and our response to them,"" Conley said in another press conference on Tuesday morning, ""define who we are."" It's understandable to be shocked by these events and to be a little wary in the hours after tragedy. But as the ""helpers"" in the wake of the Boston bombing reminded me, we are more the same than different, and more good than evil. We're all geared to be helpers. And that's who we'll continue to be.","A Mr. Rogers quote was widely shared on Twitter on Monday .
After tragedy, he says, we should ""look for the helpers""
John Sutter: That message is resonant following the Boston bombing .

"(CNN) -- Sudden seismic activity caused a ""mega-mudslide"" in the Bolivian capital of La Paz Sunday, the country's state news agency reported. The mudslide left at least 800 families homeless, according to the ABI news agency's report, which did not mention any fatalities or injuries. A fault stretching 80 to 100 hectares (200 to 250 acres) triggered the disaster, ABI said. Bolivia's president called an emergency meeting of government ministers late Sunday to evaluate the damage left behind by the mudslide and declared the area an emergency zone. During a visit at a school that served as a shelter Sunday night, Vice President Alvaro Garcia Linera pledged that the government would help victims rebuild.

"New York (CNN) -- Hate crime and robbery indictments were brought Tuesday in two separate incidents in which suspects allegedly targeted gay men for violence at Manhattan gay bars. Two men were accused of attacking a man in the bathroom of the Stonewall Inn, an iconic gay bar in downtown Manhattan, on October 3, according to a release from the New York district attorney's office. Matthew Francis, 21, and Christopher Orlando, 17, both from Staten Island, were charged with two counts of attempted robbery as a hate crime and one count of assault as a hate crime. In addition, Francis was charged with one count of criminal possession of a weapon. A 34-year old victim, whose name is not being released, was at a urinal inside the bar when one of the defendants allegedly asked him whether he was gay, according a news release from the district attorney's office. When the victim responded yes, Matthew Francis, 21, allegedly yelled, ""Get away from me f----t. I don't like gay people."" He then asked for money, saying, ""Give me a dollar. Give me a 20,"" according to the news release. The victim refused and Francis allegedly push him to ground and punched him several times in the face and chest. The other defendant Christopher Orlando, 17, stood in front of the exit preventing him from leaving, the district attorney's office said. Bar patrons and staff members chased the suspects outside, where they were arrested by police officers who had been called to the scene. The victim suffered ""substantial pain and a laceration to the head"" and had to be treated at a hospital, the district attorney's office said. The Stonewall Inn was the site of a series of demonstrations in 1969 that were triggered when patrons fought back during a police raid. The incident is widely considered the start of the gay rights movement. An additional indictment Tuesday came in a separate, similar incident a little more than a week later. Frederick Giunta, 25, of Queens, New York, has been charged with attempted robbery and assault as a hate crime. Giunta is accused of stealing an unnamed victim's wallet on October 11. That same day, he allegedly made racist and anti-gay comments and struck a second unnamed victim in the face at Julius, another popular gay club in the West Village area of Manhattan. ""Attacks such as these not only harm individual victims, they also threaten entire communities in New York City,"" Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus R. Vance Jr. said in a statement Tuesday. ""We created the Hate Crimes Unit to identify and then to build strong cases against those who commit bias crimes. New York City's diverse populations deserve our respect and protection,"" he said. Attorneys for Francis, Orlando, and Giunta have not yet responded to requests for comment from CNN. CNN's Kristen Hamill contributed to this report .","Two men accused of attacking a man at the Stonewall Inn in Manhattan on October 3 .

"(CNN) -- ItÂ´s the ultimate repair tool. A silicone material that can be shaped like playdough, can bond to almost any surface and after a few hours of exposure to air becomes a super tough, durable rubber. ""Sugru"" - coming from the Irish word for ""play"" - is now being used to fix leaky pipes, create custom-made handles and even help a disabled, fingerless canoeist modify one of her paddles. Unlike existing moldable putty, Sugru doesn't go rock hard when dry, but stays flexible, waterproof and heat resistant up to 180 degrees Celsius (356 degrees Fahrenheit). ""We think that Sugru can be something as big or bigger than duct tape, superglue or anything else that you use to repair,"" says its Irish-born inventor Jane Ni Dhulchaointigh. However, like many great inventions before, it only came into existence by chance. Ni Dhulchaointigh, a design student at the Royal College of Art in London at the time, had been messing around in the workshop, trying out new combinations of materials when she started mixing silicone adhesive and wood-waste into small balls. They looked like wood when finished, but when you threw them on the floor they would bounce. ""I thought, that's random,"" says Ni Dhulchaointigh, who admits many other designers might have then left it at that. ""But for me, I knew that there was something there. There was something a little bit magical. I just didn't know what it was."" It was only as she began using bits of the material around her home to repair things that she had what she calls her ""eureka moment"" and came to realize its real usefulness and application. ""Every time I'd make up a batch of it for my experiments, I'd have bits left over. I hate wasting stuff so I started using the leftovers around my house just to fix little things, I modified a kitchen knife that was really uncomfortable. My sink plug was just slightly too small, so I just made a little ring to make that work. ""I was doing it completely unconsciously. And I was there beating myself up going, I can't find the application for this material, until my boyfriend James said to me one night, maybe there's not this one perfect thing for this material. Maybe what you're doing in the kitchen is actually the thing."" It took six years of hard work before the first packs of her material were being sold to consumers. Her story from the workshop to marketplace, together with the help of business partners and friends, has been a familiar one of luck, near bankruptcy and late salvation. ""It has been a long journey,"" she says. ""First of all, the technology has been difficult to invent. But second of all, you know, we're not a big company with big budgets behind us."" Send your photos of Sugru fixes to CNN's iReport . ""We've been doing it on a shoestring for years. And anyone who's ever pitched for investment funding will know it's a bitch. It's really difficult for an unlikely group of people to get investment funding. I mean, we probably pitched to over 100 investors where we got, maybe two or three over the years."" Around 2008, five years after she first came up with the idea, with a product almost ready to launch, Jane and her small team of partners found themselves close to running out of money, as promised investment from major manufacturers failed to materialize. Watch: See how versatile and strong Sugru is . In a last ditch attempt, they decided to scrape together enough money to build their own ""little cottage industry factory"" and do it themselves. And with the help of family and friends they put together 1,000 packs. ""What we're quite good at is design, it's what we do, so we had a fantastic package design and a really great website design. When we went live it looked like we were much bigger than we were."" From that point, the investors came on board fast and in less than three years they have ballooned to annual sales of $2 million, a staff of 25 and a customer base of more than 100,000 across 100 countries. Perhaps, the most unique thing about Sugru is that its practical uses is being demonstrated not by its inventor, but by the general public. Thousands of people have posted comments and pictures on Twitter, YouTube and other websites showing how they have put the material to good use. ""We get emails every day with pictures and stories of what people have done. They do things with it that we couldn't have dreamed of. It feels like magic sometimes."" Ni Dhulchaointigh says her product is the ultimate tool in the battle against wastefulness. ""I think it can really benefit our urban way of life, where we depend so much on buying new things all the time and replacing them if they're not quite right. It's not only wasteful, but it doesn't make the most of us as human beings with all the potential that we have.""","Sugru is a self-setting rubber material which sticks tight to almost any surface .

"(CNN) -- Will the future of the eurozone be decided at thousands of ATMs across the continent? That may be a stretch, but Spaniards and Greeks are withdrawing billions of euros from their bank accounts and sending them somewhere ""safer."" And they're getting some encouragement, too. Deutsche Bank, for example, is soliciting the money of Spaniards nervous about the solvency of banks at home. Such nervousness is understandable, as the Spanish government struggles to inject liquidity into the country's fourth-largest bank -- Bankia -- and other financial institutions weighed down by bad property loans. Finance Minister Cristobal Montoro admitted on Spanish radio Tuesday that the state has ""a problem with access to the (debt) markets."" Spanish officials say €50 billion (about $62 billion) may be required to keep the country's banks afloat. Analysts at investment bank UBS believe the figure may be closer to €120 billion. Earlier this week, the Bank of Spain disclosed that the net outflow of capital in March was a record €66.2 billion, twice as much as the previous peak in December. Data from the European Central Bank shows that in April deposits of individuals and companies held at Spanish banks fell by €31.5 billion ($39 billion), though it's unclear how much of that money may have gone abroad. On one day in May, Greeks withdrew an estimated €700 million euros from local banks -- scared that a ""Grexit"" (the now familiar shorthand for a disorderly Greek withdrawal from the eurozone) would destroy their savings. The contagion has now spread to Cyprus, whose banks have made about €23 billion in loans to Greek individuals and companies. Last week, Cypriot President Demetris Christofias pointedly would not rule out the need for European support in rescuing banks with high exposure to Greece. Cyprus is the third smallest economy in the eurozone. Spain is the fourth largest. And given the brinkmanship between Spain's government and the European Union over how to rescue that country's banks, Spaniards may well send more of their money to safe havens. (This is now becoming known as ""Spanic."") Spain wants cash at low interest rates from the European Central Bank, or ECB, pumped directly into its banks, because its own borrowing costs are so much higher -- the yield on its 10-year bond was 6.4% Tuesday. Speaking to the Spanish Senate Tuesday, Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy for the first time called publicly for the creation of eurobonds. That puts him at odds with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and the ECB. Put crudely, eurobonds would dilute Germany's fiscal strength in a pool of junk debt. The ECB governor, Mario Draghi, has indirectly accused Spain of underestimating the importance of its banking problem. In the words of one financial analyst, it's like two cars racing toward each other on a single-track road. Someone's nerve has to give. The ECB has already plowed more than €1 trillion into the European banking system since December in an effort to stimulate liquidity. That injection also helped lower Italian and Spanish sovereign bond yields, as banks used some of the cash to snap up government debt. Expect the European Stability Mechanism, which debuts next month armed with €500 billion, to have plenty of suitors, even though it won't be allowed to lend directly to banks. A series of summits . There was not much clue about the way forward after a conference call early Tuesday among the finance ministers and central bank governors of the G-7, which includes the United States, Germany, Japan and Britain. A terse statement issued afterward said: ""The G-7 Ministers and Governors reviewed developments in the global economy and financial markets and the policy response under consideration, including the progress towards financial and fiscal union in Europe."" Next stop is the G-20 summit in Los Cabos, Mexico. It would be an unwieldy format for making a bold statement of intent on the eurozone -- especially as the meeting comes the day after the next Greek election. Perhaps more important to the future of the single currency will be the European Union summit at the end of the month, June 28-29. Draghi wants a Europe-wide ""banking union"" that would have powers akin to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation in the United States and would deter a run on the most vulnerable banks in southern Europe. Speaking to Reuters during a conference in Latvia, the International Monetary Fund's Christine Lagarde said Tuesday: ""The master plan that everybody signs up to will be important because it will set a vision, it will set a collective determination. And that is lacking at the moment."" Analysts say such a ""master plan"" would need to correct the eurozone's schizophrenic structure: a single currency without a common fiscal policy or Europe-wide bond market. Austan Goolsbee, former chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers in the Obama administration, summed up the root problem in a Wall Street Journal article last week, saying, ""The eurozone problem remains the locking together of very different economies into a monetary union without a way to adjust."" He added, ""Normally, exchange-rate adjustments would reduce this gap. ... But without an exchange-rate safety valve you need an alternate way to rebalance economies."" For Germany, whose approval is needed for any initiative to protect European banks, there is at least a silver lining in the current crisis. As investors flee to safety, Germany's two-year bond pays effectively zero percent. In other words, it's borrowing for free, quite possibly with the help of anxious Spaniards. At least Europeans have the Euro 2012 football tournament to distract them for the rest of this month, starting Friday. In the last tournament -- in 2008 -- Spain defeated Germany in the final.","Money is moving around Europe amid nervousness about the solvency of banks .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- The British government said Saturday was a ""historic day"" after two loyalist paramilitary groups announced they had completed the process of decommissioning their weapons. The Ulster Defense Association also said it was decommissioning its weapons. The Ulster Volunteer Force and Red Hand Commando made the announcement Saturday, the Northern Ireland Office (NIO) said. A third loyalist group, the Ulster Defense Association, announced it had begun the process of decommissioning, according to the NIO, which is the British government department responsible for Northern Ireland affairs. Loyalist paramilitary groups are those that want Northern Ireland to remain a part of the United Kingdom. While it was not clear what led up to Saturday's announcements, the three groups had faced an August deadline to demonstrate substantial progress toward decommissioning. A report last month by independent monitors questioned whether the groups were serious about completing the decommissioning process. Shaun Woodward, the secretary of state for Northern Ireland, then said he was tired of ""foot-dragging"" on the issue. If there was no substantial progress by August, Woodward said, he would end the amnesty the groups currently enjoy. Current legislation ensures that individuals handling illegal arms with the purpose of decommissioning them are immune from prosecution. ""Today's announcement is a culmination of a long and difficult process,"" Woodward said in a statement Saturday. ""The leadership of the UVF and RHC have delivered on what they said they would do. In decommissioning their weapons they have clearly signaled that loyalism has nothing to fear and is confident in the political institutions and wants to play a positive role in the future of Northern Ireland."" The two groups made a ""bold and courageous decision,"" he said, and he urged the UDA to continue decommissioning. ""For those who have doubted the political process, it is proof that the politics works and that guns have no place in a normal society."" he said. ""This is proof that decommissioning works and today's acts of leadership (are) further testimony to the transformation in Northern Ireland."" U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton praised the move, calling it a ""courageous step."" ""Leaders on all sides deserve our praise for their continued commitment to moving the process forward,"" she said in a statement Saturday. The Ulster Volunteer Force was formed in 1966 and has conducted bombings, assassinations, kidnappings, extortion, and robberies, according to GlobalSecurity.org. Before its 1994 cease-fire, targets included nationalist paramilitary groups -- those fighting for the reunification of Ireland. The Red Hand Commando is a splinter group of the UVF. The Ulster Defense Association is the largest loyalist paramilitary group in Northern Ireland, with between 2,000 and 5,000 members, according to the U.S. State Department. It has evolved into a criminal group deeply involved in drug trafficking, but it has also targeted the Catholic community, the State Department says.","Ulster Volunteer Force and Red Hand Commando made the announcement .

"(CNN) -- Jury selection begins Monday in the federal hate crime case against two Pennsylvania men who are accused of fatally beating a Mexican immigrant while shouting racial epithets at him. An all-white jury last year convicted Brandon Piekarsky and Derrick Donchak of misdemeanor simple assault, but acquitted . them of felony counts including aggravated assault, ethnic intimidation and hindering apprehension. The 2008 beating of Luis Ramirez and its aftermath divided the small, rural mining town of Shenandoah, Pennsylvania, along racial lines and drew national attention. After the verdict, Pennsylvania Gov. Ed Rendell sent a letter to U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder recommending the Justice Department pursue civil rights charges. ""The evidence suggests that Mr. Ramirez was targeted, beaten and killed because he was Mexican,"" Rendell wrote. ""Such lawlessness and violence hurts not only the victim of the attack, but also our towns and communities that are torn apart by such bigotry and intolerance."" Jurors found Piekarsky not guilty of third-degree murder. Prosecutors alleged he delivered a fatal kick to Ramirez's head after Ramirez was knocked to the ground in the alcohol-fueled brawl on a residential Shenandoah street. After last year's trial, the two were sentenced to up to 23 months in the county jail. If convicted on the hate crime charges, Donchak and Piekarsky face a maximum penalty of life in prison. Donchak also faces a maximum of 20 years in prison if convicted of obstruction, and an additional five years for conspiring to obstruct justice. ""Violence motivated by bigotry and hate has no place in America, and yet it remains all too prevalent in many of our communities,"" said Assistant Attorney General Thomas Perez in the Justice Department statement announcing their indictment last year. Once jury selection is finished in the federal case, the trial in the U.S. District Court in Scranton, Pennsylvania, is expected to take five days, according to information posted on the court's website. For months, attorneys have been haggling over the details of the federal trial. In a motion filed in August, lawyers representing Piekarsky and Donchak criticized a proposed jury question list federal prosecutors had submitted, claiming the question list included plans to question jurors about their registration to vote, their political philosophy, their attitude toward enforcing the law, the books they read and what bumper stickers they have on their car. ""The government has attempted to politicize this case from the beginning and its proposed questionnaire is but a further attempt to do so,"" the motion said. They continued, ""The premise for the government's questions on political philosophy is obvious. The government deems white, rural conservatives as likely bigots unable to apply the law and follow the court's instructions in this case. Not only is this premise insulting, it fails to further the court's obligation to ensure a fair and impartial jury."" The final question list approved by U.S. District Judge A. Richard Caputo has been sealed. Last year, Pennsylvania prosecutors alleged a group of teens including Donchak and Piekarsky baited Ramirez, an undocumented Mexican immigrant, into a confrontation following a night of drinking. Donchak was convicted of corrupting minors for providing the alcohol to his friends before the fight. According to the federal indictment, Donchak and Piekarsky were walking home from a local festival when they encountered Ramirez, and attacked him on a street ""by striking and kicking him while members of the group yelled racial slurs at him,"" the Justice Department said. A medical examiner ruled Ramirez died from blunt-force trauma to the head, according to the indictment.","Two men are accused of beating a Mexican immigrant following a night of drinking .

"(CNN) -- As the death toll from Syria's almost year-long uprising continues to climb, Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Moallem vowed to defend his country's ""independence."" ""We are not happy to see brothers killing each other. But this is our country. But we will defend our sovereignty and independence,"" he told reporters. The minister said no one is dying in Syria because of hunger or sickness and that despite the ""economic international boycott,"" his government is providing all necessary services. ""Do you think there is a government in this world ... (that cares) about Syrian people welfare more than the Syrian government? I don't see this logic,"" Moallem said. As day broke on Tuesday, four people were killed across Syria, opposition activists said. At least 144 people were reported killed Monday, including 64 who died in a ""horrifying massacre"" at a checkpoint in Homs province. Those killed at a checkpoint in the Abel area were attempting to flee shelling in the Baba Amr neighborhood in the city of Homs, said the Local Coordination Committees of Syria, a network of opposition activists. ""Reports said security members and thugs kidnapped the women among them,"" the network said in a statement. Residents found 47 corpses in one area and 17 in a second one, it said. A total of 68 corpses were found in the area, in farmland in western Homs province, said the opposition Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, apparently referencing the same incident. The bodies were found after an injured survivor reported the attack, the group said. All the bodies had been either shot or stabbed. In all, 104 people were killed Monday in Homs, an opposition stronghold, according to the LCC. They included four defected soldiers, three woman and three children. The deaths came on a day when Syrian officials announced that the nation's new draft constitution received approval and the European Union imposed new sanctions on the country amid ongoing clashes. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said earlier explosions rocked Homs and shelling was occurring in Baba Amr. Twenty people were wounded when a large shell struck an anti-government gathering in Homs, the group said. Meanwhile, Interior Minister Mohammed al-Shaar announced that 89.4% of voters approved the draft constitution, and 57.4% of eligible voters cast ballots. President Bashar al-Assad's regime has touted the constitutional referendum as a move toward reform. Syria announced the referendum amid intense international cries to stop the bloodshed and open its regime to change. But analysts and protesters widely describe the effort as a farce, a superficial attempt to pacify al-Assad's critics. ""We dismiss it as absolutely cynical. ... Essentially, what he's done here is put a piece of paper that he controls to a vote that he controls so that he can try and maintain control,"" U.S. State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said of the referendum and al-Assad. She cited the ongoing violence in such cities as Homs and Hama and asked: ""How could you possibly have any kind of a democratic process in conditions like that?"" Aid efforts were under way in the midst of the violence. The Syrian Red Crescent and the International Committee of the Red Cross entered the province of Hama on Monday to provide aid to civilians, said Simon Schorno, spokesman for the Red Cross. A one-month supply of food, along with blankets and hygiene kits, were distributed to 12,000 people, he said. Beatrice Megevand-Roggo, the Red Cross' head of operations for the Middle East, said a handful of aid workers were also able to go into Baba Amr. ""There were four ambulances that entered Baba Amr, belonging to the Syrian Red Crescent. They were loaded with medical goods. They indeed were not able to evacuate the two foreign journalists. I don't have the reasons why. They could evacuate an elderly woman, a pregnant woman with her husband,"" she said. The two journalists Megevand-Roggo was referencing were British photographer Paul Conroy and French reporter Edith Bouvier. Both were wounded in shelling. Red Cross spokesman Hicham Hassan said aid workers were also not able Monday to recover and evacuate the bodies of two journalists killed in Baba Amr last week. Marie Colvin, an American journalist who worked for London's Sunday Times, was killed in a shelling attack, along with French journalist Remi Ochlik. Colvin's mother, Rosemarie, said Sunday that aid workers have been trying for days to remove her daughter's body. CNN and other media outlets cannot independently verify opposition or government reports because Syria has severely limited access to the country by foreign journalists. But the vast majority of reports from the ground indicate that government forces are massacring citizens in an attempt to wipe out civilians seeking al-Assad's ouster. No attempts at getting al-Assad to stop his regime's crackdown on dissidents have stopped the onslaught. The Council of the European Union agreed Monday on new sanctions regarding Syria after foreign ministers met in Brussels, Belgium, said spokeswoman Susanne Kiefer. Seven ministers of the al-Assad regime will have their EU assets frozen and will be denied entry into the EU, Kiefer said. In addition, assets of the Syrian Central Bank in the EU will be frozen. Legitimate trade will be allowed to continue, she said, but must be authorized first. ""Today's decisions will put further pressure on those who are responsible for the ruthless campaign of repression in Syria,"" Catherine Ashton, the EU foreign policy chief, said in a statement. ""The measures target the regime and its ability to conduct the appalling violence against civilians. As long as the repression continues, the EU will keep imposing sanctions."" Elsewhere in Syria on Monday, two people were killed and eight wounded by government shelling on the village of Sarmeen in Idlib province, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. The shelling began Sunday night, and Syrian troops have entered Sarmeen, said Abu Mustafa al-Sayed, a Syrian opposition and community leader in the town of Binnish, also in Idlib province. The Syrian army has Sarmeen surrounded, and communications with the residents have been cut off, he said. And in Damascus, security forces fired on mourners at a funeral, according to the Local Coordination Committees. Clashes were also occurring in Deir Ezzor, the group said, and 14 students were arrested during a protest at Aleppo University. The opposition network estimates that 9,000 people have been killed since the government launched its crackdown in March. The Syrian government says that more than 2,000 members of its security forces have been killed by ""terrorists"" during that same period. Asked Monday whether Syria would be referred to the International Criminal Court, French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe said, ""I hope the international community reflects on the conditions of referral. ... It's a difficult issue. Syria is not a participating state, so it's up to the Security Council to address this question. They must therefore continue to gather the elements that would permit an eventual referral.""

"(CNN) -- He's gone. So, now what? How do those who clogged the streets of Egypt on Wednesday wanting so desperately to oust Mohamed Morsy, the now-deposed president of Egypt, feel about the future now it appears to be wide open? Earlier this week, CNN spoke to four protesters about their hopes, demands and expectations, from a veteran demonstrator in Cairo who has marched in crowds since the beginning of Egypt's revolution in 2011 to a first-time protester in the port city of Alexandria. We spoke to them again Friday about how they felt when Morsy was toppled, their thoughts on what should happen next and their concerns for the future of a country they are fighting so hard to change. This is what they had to say: . Ahmed Raafat . I was at Tahrir Square during the announcement of the army's statement. [The] square exploded with joy once protesters knew that Morsy was no longer the president. People were singing, chanting, singing and waving Egyptian flags. Fireworks were all over the square. Military helicopters flew over the square for hours. I was happy that Morsy was toppled, but I was concerned, too. The fact that the army is back on the political scene makes me worry. The road map is what we have been calling for since [former Egyptian president] Mubarak's ousting. I wish Morsy had called for early presidential elections and saved the whole situation. The situation is very complicated and, to be honest, I'm not sure if the army's intervention was the right thing to do. I would personally prefer that we achieve our goals and demands without any interference from the military. There's a strong debate on whether what happened was a coup or a revolution. I think the military sided with the people after [they] took to the streets. Egyptians prefer to call it a revolution. iReport opinion: It's an Egyptian revolution, not a coup . Those in power [now] should stick to the demands of the people. They should return Egypt to civilian rule as soon as possible. They should respect human rights and apply the law fairly without any extraordinary measures. They should keep the transitional period as short as possible. [The] people must keep a close watch on those in power and take action if there's any deviation from their demands and goals. Mohamed Boraie . It was such an interesting day. I went to [Tahrir] Square around 4 p.m., as I wanted to see how people would react to the speech. People started shaking hands and celebrating after hearing [the] news [of] Morsy's ousting. I sat down in a corner of the square and observed people celebrating and tried to capture it on camera. ElBaradei: 'Morsy's ouster was needed so Egypt cannot fail' The army acted very quickly to meet the increasing demands of the protesters to protect the country from slipping into violence and civil war between pro- and anti-Morsy protesters. The army ... is very keen to make sure that their interests are protected before the country becomes uncontrollable. This army made it clear, by choosing a civilian to lead the interim process ... that the masses of people would not revolt back at the army as before. It is sad to see Morsy destroy the political future of the Muslim Brotherhood [Islamist movement backing Morsy that rose to power after the fall of Mubarak] by sticking to power and not allowing a smooth transition. The Brotherhood has a great grassroots structure that should be utilized to build Egypt. Those in power now should focus on economic reform to reach the demands of the lower income brackets. Also, education and gender equality should be a priority to empower youth and women -- two factors any economy depends on to progress. Maged Eskander . We have finally relaxed now this bad group [of rulers] has finally ended [their time in power] -- my wife told me it's the same feeling you have after cleaning your house. All the army's [actions] until now are great, [they've not made] a single mistake. They learned a big lesson from January 25, 2011, [when the Egyptian revolution began]. They just protected the people's demands and put the country on the right track. Events in Egypt: What we know so far . Morsy should step back, and face legal matters if there any [and] we [will] steadily build our country. We should write a good constitution that fulfills all Egyptians, [have] elections and select a capable government. The people can do a lot to support their leaders -- they just need a guide, and the people will do miracles. Marwan Osman . I was following the news from home in front of the television and on my laptop on social networks, along with my family. When the news was announced -- it was like Egypt had just won the World Cup in soccer. Everyone was happy and my parents cried from joy. [People in] cars in the street began cheering for the news. Opinion: Get ready for the extremist backlash . I'm one of the people who does not want the army to rule the country, so the interim president is the most suitable solution to avoid having the army ruling. Nothing should happen to Morsy. He should be free to live wherever he wants and however he wants. Whoever is in power now should prepare fast for presidential elections and complete the transitional period as early as possible. The people should observe the progress done [so far] -- and protest again if something goes wrong against their will.","Protesters against former Egyptian president celebrated, now are looking to the future .

There was concern about violence and reflection on what those now in power need to do .

"Bangkok, Thailand (CNN) -- A Thai court on Wednesday sentenced a political activist to 10 years in prison for insulting the country's revered king, a decision that drew criticism from human rights groups and the European Union. The Criminal Court in Bangkok ruled that Somyot Pruksakasemsuk had breached Thailand's strict lese majeste laws when a magazine he edited, Voice of Thaksin, published two satirical articles found to be critical of the monarchy. Read more: King Bhumibol Adulyadej and His 85th Birthday . Somyot, who arrived in court barefoot with shackles around his ankles, plans to appeal, according to his lawyer, Karom Polpornklang. ""The verdict seriously undermines the right to freedom of expression and press freedom,"" The European Union said in a statement. ""At the same time, it affects Thailand's image as a free and democratic society."" Read related: Obama welcomes 'good vibes' in Thailand . Thai laws allow courts to hand down lengthy prison terms to people convicted of defaming, insulting or threatening the royal family. Before his detention began in April 2011, Somyot had campaigned to change the lese majeste law. And he submitted a petition to the Thai Constitutional Court while he was in jail, arguing the law goes against basic human rights and the punishment it permits is not proportionate. Read related: Thai police use tear gas at government protest . Authorities have held him in jail since his arrest, denying repeated bail requests. ""The court's ruling appears to be more about Somyot's strong support for amending the lese majeste law than about any harm incurred by the monarchy,"" said Brad Adams, Asia director for Human Rights Watch. Somyot also received a further one-year sentence Wednesday for a previous suspended sentence for defamation, bringing his total prison term to 11 years. Read related: Will Thailand join the TPP? More than 20 diplomats, many of them European, attended the hearing, along with about 20 of Somyot's supporters, at whom he smiled as he left the courtroom. Somyot's magazine published the controversial articles in 2010, during severe political unrest in Bangkok. He was a member of the Red Shirts, a group that held anti-government protests and clashed with Thai security forces. The Red Shirts support former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, who was ousted in a bloodless military coup in 2006. It is not possible to report details of the content of the articles in question since they have been deemed to violate Thai law.

Still, the king -- formally crowned on May 5, 1950 -- is a deeply respected figure in Thailand and enjoys widespread popularity.

"New York (CNN) -- The ninth and 10th suspects arrested in a series of anti-gay beatings in New York were arraigned in Bronx Criminal Court Tuesday evening. Jose Dominguez, 22, who was arrested early Tuesday morning, was charged with sexual abuse, gang assault in the first and second degree, unlawful imprisonment, criminal possession of a weapon, hate crime, and harassment, according to the complaint filed in court. Ruddy Vargas-Perez, 22, was charged with 10 charges including four counts of robbery, gang assault in the second degree, unlawful imprisonment, criminal possession of a weapon, hate crime, and harassment, according to the complaint. His bail was set at $25,000. Despite the complaint stating the 10 charges brought against Vargas-Perez, his attorney, Benjamin Heinrich, maintains his client is only charged with robbery. ""He had nothing to do with any of that horrific conduct and he was as mortified as we all are by what happened to that poor man,"" Heinrich said. ""And we see that he hasn't been charged with that."" The courtroom was packed with Vargas-Perez' family and friends who gathered outside after the arraignment holding signs with his picture and chanting, ""Ruddy."" ""We said it once and we'll say it again, that my brother was innocent through all this time and he was not guilty. And we deserve an apology from the government,"" said his brother, Raul Sweeney. Vargas-Perez was taken into custody late Monday afternoon, the New York Police Department said. Heinrich told reporters his client was ""absolutely not"" involved in the October 3 attacks. Of the other eight suspects in the attacks, six have been ordered held without bail and bail for two others has been set at $100,000. The case involved three victims being held against their will by as many as 10 assailants who beat them in a vacant apartment and sodomized two of them, New York Police Commissioner Ray Kelly said Friday. A fourth victim was beaten and robbed in connection with the attacks, which New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg described as ""torture."" ""I was sickened by the brutal nature of these crimes and saddened at the anti-gay bias that contributed to them,"" Bloomberg said Saturday. ""Hate crimes such as these strike fear into all of us."" The string of attacks began when members of a street gang calling themselves the Latin King Goonies learned that an aspiring member is gay, authorities said. According to Kelly, the 17-year-old pledge was forced into an unoccupied apartment around 3:30 a.m. Sunday and questioned about his contact with a 30-year-old man. He was thrown into a wall, forced to strip naked, hit in the head with a beer can, cut with a box cutter and sodomized with the wooden handle of a plunger, the commissioner said. His assailants let him go, but threatened to hurt him or his family if he talked, Kelly said. The victim went to a hospital for treatment, but claimed his injuries were from an attack by unknown assailants on the street, the commissioner said. The same day, another 17-year-old was beaten and questioned about the same 30-year-old man, robbed of jewelry and held against his will in the same vacant apartment, Kelly said. About an hour after that, the 30-year-old man was lured to the location where the second 17-year-old was being held, was forced to strip naked and was tied to a chair opposite the teenager, Kelly said. The teenager was forced to hit the older male several times in the face and burn him with cigarettes, after which the suspects assaulted him with their fists and a chain and sodomized him with a small baseball bat, the commissioner said. The 30-year-old man was later dumped outside his home, he added. Five of the suspects then went to the apartment the 30-year-old victim shared with his older brother and let themselves in using a key they'd taken from the man, Kelly explained. They beat the man's brother and demanded money from him. When he refused, the assailants put a cell phone to his ear and he heard his younger brother say that he was being held against his will and to ""give them the money,"" the commissioner said. The older brother told the suspects where they could find the money, after which they tied him up and left the apartment, Kelly added. All ten of the suspects live in the Bronx, police said. The hate crimes task force took over the investigation, Kelly said, and coordinated with the Bronx Gang Division and Bronx Special Victims Squad to help identify and capture the suspects. Pending charges against them include unlawful imprisonment, abduction, sodomy, assault, robbery, and menacing, all as hate crimes, the commissioner said. The crimes and arrests have attracted national attention. ""It is tragic to see what hate can do,"" Joe Solmonese, president of the Human Rights Campaign, a national gay rights group, said Saturday. ""These three men were brutally attacked ... simply for who they are."" CNN's Elise Zeiger, Christina Romano, Susan Candiotti and Julie Cannold contributed to this report.","The ninth and 10 suspects are arraigned .

"(CNN) -- I was going through my Twitter feed Monday morning when I came across this: ""Happy greatest day of the year, #Boston!"" And so it is. Or was, until about 2:50 p.m., when explosions near the finish line of the Boston Marathon transformed a celebration into a scene of carnage. What matters now, needless to say, are the victims â€” the dead, the injured and their families and friends. But if you are looking for some insight into Boston at this horrible moment, it helps to understand why our marathon matters and where it fits into our civic psyche. Why it was, until Monday, our greatest day of the year. To begin with, Marathon Monday is a holiday â€” Patriots Day, an annual commemoration of the Battles of Lexington and Concord. Not everyone has the day off, but many do, including schoolchildren, for whom this is the first day of spring vacation. That's why so many people descend on the marathon every year, and why so many people found themselves in harm's way. In a city and a region obsessed with tradition, you couldn't ask for more than the oldest marathon in the country coinciding with patriotic re-enactments of colonials versus redcoats, all playing out against the backdrop of the budding spring. Today was cool but sunny, and -- finally -- with not a filthy black snowbank in sight. It's a time of year that gives us hope of better days to come. Rothkopf: In the face of terror, keep calm . To complete the celebration, Patriots Day marks the annual 11 a.m. Red Sox game at Fenway Park, an utterly local tradition concocted so baseball crowds wouldn't get in the way of marathon crowds. The runners stream through Kenmore Square, a block away from where other, considerably better-paid athletes are engaged in more sedentary pursuits. The Sox beat the Tampa Bay Rays 3-2 on Monday. There wasn't much time to celebrate. The explosions came less than an hour later. As a spectator sport, the Boston Marathon probably hit its peak in the 1970s, when local favorites Bill Rodgers and Joan Benoit Samuelson were dominating the race. These days, it's more of a pure spectacle, and I doubt many of those watching could name even one of the East African runners who have won in recent years. To be honest, I have never attended the marathon in person, let alone run in it. My only direct involvement came in the early 1990s, when I worked as editor of the official program for several years. It is, nevertheless, something that all of us here take pride in. Moreover, just about everyone has a personal connection. We all know people who were running in it, and perhaps we donated to the charitable cause they had registered with so they could gain entry. As the terrible news began to spread, my Facebook feed was filled with messages from people I know telling me they were all right, or asking if someone else had been heard from. I am not privy to what sort of security arrangements go into planning the Boston Marathon, but there's only so much you can do along a 26.2-mile route that passes through seven cities and towns in addition to Boston. As I write this, there is some speculation that bombs may have been placed in trash cans. That may or may not prove to be accurate, but can you imagine securing every trash can, every manhole, every nook and cranny from Hopkinton to Boston? Sadly, the marathon will not be the same after today. Security will be tightened, and it will transform what had been a joyful and carefree experience into something else. ""Boston is a tough and resilient town,"" President Obama said in his White House remarks Monday evening. And we are. The marathon will go on. The Patriots Day tradition will continue. But it may also be a long time, if ever, before anyone again refers to this as our ""greatest day of the year."" The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Dan Kennedy.","Dan Kennedy: Before Monday, the Boston Marathon marked city's annual ""Greatest Day""
It brings the marathon, Patriots Day and an 11:AM Red Sox game; kids are off from school .
Kennedy: Marathon is 26.2 miles, in future, must every mile be checked for bombs?

"(CNN) -- In the brief history of Web sites, there are few if any second chances. Remember Friendster? Experts say MySpace should focus on music to stage a comeback. Here, Green Day performs at a MySpace event. That's why it's difficult for some industry observers to see a comeback for MySpace, the large online social network that has seen its popularity flatline and its hipness surpassed by younger sites like Twitter and Facebook in recent months. ""If you look back at the first era of the Web, there are a bunch of companies that didn't survive that -- the search sites like Lycos and Excite,"" said Richard MacManus, founder and editor of ReadWriteWeb, a technology news site. ""I guess you could say MySpace is in danger of falling into the same black hole those companies did."" He added: ""If you look at the history, MySpace is going to disappear over time."" MacManus and others said it is possible but unlikely that MySpace will buck the Web's high turnover rate. If successful, a reborn MySpace would prove something new: that it's possible for a big-name Web site to recover from a slump. There are some signs that MySpace is trying to reinvent itself. In April, MySpace hired a new chief executive, Owen Van Natta, who comes from a background in online music and is expected to help the social network beef up its strong presence in the entertainment community. Van Natta joined MySpace after a stint at Project Playlist, a music site, and after working as an executive at Facebook. He takes the helm at MySpace at a time when the site is looking stale compared with its newer competitors. Facebook unseated MySpace as the most popular online social network worldwide in the spring of last year, according to comScore, a research firm. At the end of 2008, Facebook had about 220 million visitors worldwide, compared with MySpace's 125 million, comScore says. MySpace's popularity appears to have plateaued, while Facebook's continues to increase. Van Natta, who declined an interview request from CNN, said at a recent technology convention that innovation could put MySpace back on top. ""Clearly, we're not the darling of the press right now, but the great thing about the Internet is that you have the opportunity to innovate and disrupt that narrative if you can deliver on these innovation promises,"" he said at The Wall Street Journal's D: All Things Digital conference. Van Natta did not say what those changes might be. MySpace needs to ""figure out what their secret sauce is going to be"" in order to survive, said Adam Ostrow, editor in chief of Mashable, a news site focused on technology. He added that the site shouldn't be discounted entirely because it remains ""huge by any standards."" Ostrow said MySpace is an example of how corporate ownership slows innovation, which spells death in the fast-moving realm of Internet technology. MySpace's innovative spirit largely died when News Corp. bought the site in 2005, he said. This left room for Facebook to come up with new ideas and plot a takeover. ""If you look at MySpace, it really peaked a few months after News Corp. acquired it,"" he said. ""News Corp. really came in and focused heavily on monetization [of the site], but perhaps, in retrospect, it was really at the sacrifice of growing the community."" The site should capitalize on what makes it different from other sites: its music player, said MG Siegler, a writer at TechCrunch, a technology news site. But that still may not be enough for MySpace to rebound, he said. ""The Web, and technology in general, are both about what-have-you-done-for-me-lately,"" Siegler said. ""It's hard. When any kind of site becomes super-popular, they maybe just kind of rest on their laurels, and they're content to keep their user base ... and then a site comes along and does something like a platform for third-party developers, like Facebook did, and then it kind of turns the market on its side."" To stage a comeback, MySpace would have to create something ""completely outside of the box,"" he said. iReport.com: Can websites like MySpace make a comeback? The problem isn't necessarily with MySpace as much as it is with the nature of online social network users today, said Jon Gibs, vice president of media analytics for Nielsen Online, a research firm. Web users are fickle, he said. ""It seems that social networks are incredibly portable, meaning that me and my friends can go from MySpace to Facebook to Twitter without blinking much,"" he said. History proves this point, he said, adding that no site has been able to successfully recover from a substantial loss of popularity. The life cycle of social networks, which appears to be shortening, is perhaps less than two years now, Gibs added. ""Facebook, as sort of an important thing in people's lives, is probably a year and a half old. And people are already out there saying, 'Well, Facebook's passé, and Twitter is the thing to do now. And before that, it seemed like MySpace had maybe a two-and-a-half-year window,"" he said. MySpace may become a niche network that's focused on its users' interests in music and entertainment, he said. The site also could follow the lead of Friendster and find popularity outside the U.S., said Siegler, of TechCrunch. ""I think that is a decent play to keep yourself alive,"" he said. Friendster, once the most popular online social network in the U.S., fell off the map here but now is among the hottest Web sites in Southeast Asia. The company moved its headquarters from San Francisco, California, to Sydney, Australia, as a symbol of the shift. MySpace also faces a demographics problem. Its users tend to be younger than Facebook's and therefore have potentially less value in the eyes of advertisers, said Matt Tatham, spokesman for Hitwise, a research company. International users also are harder to make money from, Siegler said. Gibs, of Nielsen, said there always will be new online social networks to challenge the old guard. The newest player is Twitter, a micro-blogging site where users post 140-character messages. ""We have already begun to hear rumbles that Facebook is beginning to wane and we all should be Twittering,"" he said. And soon, Gibs said, technology will evolve to the point where it leaves MySpace, Facebook or Twitter behind.","Web sites get few if any second chances at success .
Experts say MySpace has fallen out of favor and will be hard-pressed to recover .
The site could follow Friendster's lead and go international .
Or it could focus on its roots in music ."
"(CNN) -- The U.S. government is getting its bill for the damage a Navy minesweeper did to a Philippine coral reef, and it's less than expected. Philippine officials say the USS Guardian damaged 2,346 square meters (25,252 square feet) of Tubbataha Reef after it ran aground January 17. That's down from the original estimate of about 4,000 square meters (43,000 square feet). And that means, under Philippine law, the United States owes $1.5 million in fines, the Tubbataha Protected Area Management Board said in a posting on the Tubbahata Reefs Natural Park website Monday. The fines are based on the amount of reef that has been damaged, the state-run Philippine News Agency reported. The Tubbahata board said the revised damage estimate was made by a team of U.S. Navy and Philippine marine biologists from Wednesday to Friday. The original survey was conducted January 27 while the warship was still on the reef. The Guardian was completely removed on March 30, when the ship's stern, the last of four sections into which its 224-foot-long hull had been cut, was lifted from the reef by a massive seagoing crane. ""Using aerial imaging, the grounding zone was originally outlined using the ship's length as the basis for computing the total damaged area. This image was later observed to be obliquely angled thus artificially expanding the area plotted on mapping software,"" the statement on the park's website said. The cost of the salvage operation to remove the ship from the reef was $45 million, Stars and Stripes reported Monday, citing a U.S. 7th Fleet spokesman. An investigation into the grounding is ongoing, but last week the Navy relieved the commanding officer and three members of the minesweeper's crew of their duties based on initial results of the probe, a Navy statement said. ""The initial investigation findings clearly indicate that the CO, Lt. Cmdr. Mark A. Rice; the executive officer (XO)/navigator, Lt. Daniel Tyler; the assistant navigator; and the officer of the deck at the time of the grounding did not adhere to standard U.S. Navy navigation procedures,"" the Navy statement said. ""The U.S. Navy has the highest accountability standards, and all four Sailors were relieved by Rear Adm. Jeffrey Harley due to their role in the grounding and a loss of confidence."" Tubbahata Reef is a UNESCO World Heritage site that is home to about 500 species of fish and 350 species of coral as well as whales, dolphins, sharks, turtles and breeding seabirds.

"(CNN) -- John Donohue: Why the NRA fights background checks . A more powerful NRA today is in no mood to follow the slogan of their ""be reasonable"" ad campaign of 14 years ago. This relatively small group -- the NRA boasts that it has 4.5 million members, which is peanuts compared to the roughly 40 million AARP members -- might have the political power to pull it off. Federal law prohibits selling guns to felons or the mentally ill. Background checks are the only way to enforce that law. So, besides criminals and the insane, who could possibly oppose universal background checks? Gun manufacturers. They are the ones who call the shots at the NRA, and they are the most important people in the opposition. The manufacturers don't want anything that interferes with total gun sales and profits. Read more ... John J. Donohue is C. Wendell and Edith M. Carlsmith professor of law at Stanford Law School and research associate at the National Bureau of Economic Research. Rand Paul: The government wants your gun rights . Congress is debating legislation that will limit Americans' right to keep and bear arms and infringe on the right to privacy. The Bill of Rights was made part of our Constitution explicitly to protect freedoms: the freedom of speech, protection against searches without a warrant, the right to trial by jury and the right to protect oneself with a firearm. I am compelled to stand up for every amendment and right enumerated in the Constitution. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid is attempting to push forward with gun control legislation. The chief problem I have is that nothing in this legislation would have prevented the terrible massacre in Newtown, Connecticut. I am open to ideas that would help prevent tragedies, but this legislation would not have saved us from the national heartbreak of the December school shooting. Read more ... Rand Paul is a Republican senator from Kentucky and a member of the Senate Foreign Relations and Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs committees. Daniel Webster: Give gun owners what they want . The politicians called out by [Mark] Kelly and [Gabrielle] Giffords let the National Rifle Association bully them into thinking that gun owners don't want key flaws in our current gun laws fixed and that you can't win elections without the backing of the NRA. The millions of dollars the NRA spent in unsuccessful attempts to win close Senate races in swing states with high gun ownership rates -- Florida, Missouri, Ohio, Virginia and Wisconsin -- suggests that candidates can and do win despite strong NRA opposition. The NRA portrays itself as an organization that speaks for and advocates for gun owners. The reality is that they speak for gun owners with the most extreme views and for the gun industry. A case in point is their opposition to requiring background checks for all firearm sales. Read more ... Daniel W. Webster is professor and director of the Center for Gun Policy and Research at Johns Hopkins School of Public Health. James Alan Fox: Gun control or carry permit won't stop mass murder . If one thing is predictable about mass shootings, however, is that they will spark arguments from gun control advocates and gun rights groups alike. Both sides of the gun issue will probably view this tragedy [shooting at Aurora, Colorado] as one more example of why more or less gun control is the answer ... and both sides will be wrong. Tighter restrictions on gun purchasing -- for example, eliminating multiple gun sales and closing the gun-show loophole -- may help reduce America's gun violence problem generally, but mass murder is unlike most other forms of violent conflict. Mass killers are determined, deliberate and dead-set on murder. They plan methodically to execute their victims, finding the means no matter what laws or other impediments the state attempts to place in their way. To them, the will to kill cannot be denied.

Many others vehemently disagreed with me, and one dissenter even wrote that the blood of the Connecticut victims was ultimately on the hands of pro-gun rights advocates. To that person I would ask: Suppose the principal at Sandy Hook Elementary who was killed lunging at the gunman was instead holding a firearm and was well-trained to use it. Would the result have been different? Or suppose you had been in that school when the killer entered, would you have preferred to be armed? Evidence and common sense suggest yes. Read more ...

Peter Bergen: Gun violence is a national security issue . The proliferation of semiautomatic weapons in the hands of Americans of the types that were used in the Newtown massacre is sometimes framed as a public health issue in the United States. There is considerable merit to the notion of treating gun violence as a public health matter. After all, homicides -- around 70% of which are accomplished with firearms in the United States according to an authoritative study by the United Nations -- are the 15th leading cause of death for Americans. But framing gun control as a public health issue doesn't quite do justice to the problem. It's probably more or less inevitable that most Americans will die of cancer or a heart attack, but why is it even plausible that so many Americans in elementary schools, colleges, movie theaters and places of worship should die at the hands of young men armed with semiautomatic weapons? Americans generally regard themselves as belonging to an exceptional nation. And in terms of living in a religiously tolerant and enormously diverse country, Americans can certainly take some justified pride. Read more ...

Dorothy Paugh: A mother's journey to bearing grief . I am a mother of three, and my views on guns have evolved significantly over the course of my lifetime. My husband hunts and believes strongly in his right to bear arms. But when my 25-year- old middle son Peter shot himself in a moment of despair last April, I came full circle to the harsh reality that there are almost twice as many suicides as murders by firearm across America, roughly 19,000 of the 30,000 gun deaths each year. Yet we disproportionately fear and almost exclusively talk of criminals in this national gun debate. My introduction to guns came on a hot summer day in 1963 when my father, 53 sent us all out of the house to have an afternoon of fun at a swimming pool in Aberdeen, Maryland. He called police, wrote ""I'm sorry"" on a scrap of paper and shot himself in our basement. He had recently lost his job. Not knowing how he would support his family, he had calculated how much his life insurance policies would pay upon his death. It was enough for my mother to raise the five of us, who were between the ages of 5 and 15 at the time. Read more ... Dorothy Paugh lost her father to suicide by gun 50 years ago.

But after 10 years, I now have a gun in my home. Listening to President Obama's news conference on Thursday marking 100 days after Sandy Hook, and the whole gun control debate, prompted me to get my viewpoint across. I married a U.S. Marine. He of course was a firm believer in his right to bear arms. This posed no issue until our son was born. I was adamant that no gun be allowed in our home, while he felt quite the opposite. We agreed on one gun locked in a safe, and his other hunting guns were stored at his parents. Slowly over the years, I became more and more fearful of being home alone on the nights he worked, especially after I had children. Read more ...

"(CNN) -- Sports are not pretty. And firing Rutgers basketball coach Mike Rice will not take the brutality out of college sports. It does not change a thing. Even in these politically correct times, the essence of sport will always lie in the Neanderthal within us all. Watching the video of Rice batter and berate his players, I recalled the dozens of other times I'd witnessed similar scenes, at my son's Amateur Athletic Union games, at playground pick-up games. And I thought immediately of watching coaches like Bobby Knight and P.J. Carlesimo. The video highlights are not easy to watch, but they do not tell the whole story. ""Yes he went overboard. But you can't get a good feeling for what went down by seeing highlights on ESPN. No one was scared of Coach Rice. We didn't fear him. We just understood him,"" Mike Coburn, who played for Rice from 2010-11, told New Jersey's Star Ledger. Opinion: Rutgers coach and sports' bully culture . Indeed, the world today is in a better, more enlightened place, where it's not nice to call people obscene or homophobic names. Where slapping people upside the head, beaning them with a basketball or giving them a swift kick in the rear is not considered the best motivational tactic. But the sports nation has not quite caught up with the rest of this kinder, gentler world. Frankly, I don't think it should -- not completely anyway. That may be hard to understand for some people. But no one who has been up close to sports can honestly be shocked by Rice's coaching techniques. He is not an anomaly -- especially in the win-at-all-costs, big-money world of college sports. He just got caught on video, and we must react. We can debate whether bully-coaching is an effective motivational tool. But there's no debate that it is practiced throughout sports, from Little League on up. For most fans, sports are a feel-good experience that teaches life lessons: how to lead, how to lose, how to push yourself to your highest potential. I watched in amazement as my son evolved from a shy, awkward, oversized boy to a strong, confident leader. The change began when he fell in love with basketball at a young age. Did he have tyrannical coaches? Yes, one. His AAU coach was a terror. Yelling the entire practice, he often degraded his 10-year-old boys. He told them they were nothings, just little black boys who would probably end up dead or in prison before 21. He screamed, eyes bulging, that without basketball they'd be nothing. He shoved them, when he thought no one was looking. And who knows what he said to his team when parents weren't within listening distance. So, his father and I always stayed close by, just in case things got out of hand. My son thought his coach was weird and angry. Many of the kids on the team were private-school, college-bound black boys. Didn't matter. Coach was still stereotyping them. For Coach, it was a rough, racist world and the boys might as well toughen up early. His team got blown out every game, but my son never wanted to quit. I remember asking a few of the pro athletes I worked with if I should take my son off the team. They said ""absolutely not."" It would be a good lesson for my son. ""You play the game for love of the game, you will not love all of your coaches,"" one Hall-of-Famer told me. Turns out, they had all experienced a Bobby Knight type of coach. A Mike Rice. And the athletes argued that it was important for a young man to learn not to let a bully coach like that break you. They said it was their worst coaches who prepared them for the bullies they met later in life, on the court and in their corporate offices. Rice never pretended to be a gentle leader. It was his brutal passion for the game, in part, that led Rutgers University's Athletic Director Tim Pernetti to hire Rice to coach the Scarlet Knights. ""I knew exactly what I was getting and I still know what I've got,"" Pernetti said when he hired Rice. ""Mike coaches with an edge. That personality is ideal for our program here in New Jersey."" D-1 basketball is big time. Rice and his team were under pressure to produce wins and prove they belonged in the big leagues. That's why Rice wasn't fired when the video was first shown to the athletic director. He was suspended for three games and fined $50,000. But the story didn't end there. It took the threat of a wrongful termination lawsuit by Eric Murdock, an ex-NBA player and a former director of player development for the Scarlet Knights, who complained to Pernetti about Rice's outrageous behavior. Murdock got fired for his concerns, according to his attorney, Raj Gadhok. Then the video was released to the media. The school decided the story was just too hot to explain -- best to dump the coach and avoid a public relations mess. It was a knee-jerk solution, a marketing move. But don't think for one minute that Rice won't find a way to rehabilitate his reputation. He'll go to anger management classes. His peers will say he's a changed man. He'll show remorse to the media. Then he'll be back coaching in the college game in no time at all. Brutes will always have a seat at the sports table. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Roxanne Jones.","Roxanne Jones: Firing Rice won't make a difference: Sports appeals to our Neanderthal side .

"(CNN) -- A senior manager at Morgan Stanley pleaded not guilty Friday to assault and hate-crime charges in connection with the stabbing of a New York City taxi driver over the cost of a fare. William Bryan Jennings, a bond-underwriting senior manager at Morgan Stanley, entered the plea in Connecticut Superior Court in Stamford, according to court documents. His next court date is set for April 12. Jennings is accused of attacking Mohamed Anmar with a 2.5-inch blade, using racial slurs against Anmar, who is of Middle Eastern descent, and failing to pay for services rendered. The racial slurs resulted in a charge of intimidation by bigotry or bias, which is classified as a hate crime, according to court documents. Police allege that after attending a company holiday party in Manhattan, Jennings hailed a cab about 11 p.m. on December 21 after a car service failed to arrive to take him to his home in Darien, Connecticut, about 40 miles away. He told police he had ""been drinking throughout the day, but didn't feel he was highly intoxicated."" According to a sworn affidavit, Anmar said he picked up Jennings, whom he described as drunk, and told him he could go to Connecticut for a flat rate of $204. When the taxi arrived at Jennings' residence, Anmar said the banker refused to pay the fare, offering him $50, according to the affidavit. Jennings told police Anmar demanded $294 and he offered to pay $160. After the disagreement, Anmar said he tried to call police from his cell phone, but he couldn't get mobile service and began driving to look for a patrol car, according to the affidavit. Both men say that Jennings tried to get out of the cab several times, but Anmar wouldn't slow down. The cabbie said he was still driving to try to find a police officer when Jennings reached through the opening in the cab's partition. Holding a penknife, Anmar said, Jennings cursed at him, saying, ""I'm going to kill you. You should go back to your country,"" according to the affidavit. Police documents allege that Jennings stabbed at Anmar, cutting his hands as he tried to close the partition. Anmar told authorities he was able to get phone service nearby and called 911. ""I felt like I was going to die that night,"" said Anmar, who required stitches in his hand for the injury. Jennings told police he acted out of self-defense, fearing Anmar would take him back to Manhattan and he might be ""dropped in any number of dangerous places."" According to court documents, Jennings is free on a $9,500 cash bond. Pen Pendleton, a spokesman for Morgan Stanley, verified that Jennings is a senior manager of North American fixed-income capital markets, and is on leave from the company. Calls to Jennings' attorney were not returned Friday. CNN's Chris Dignam contributed to this report.","William Jennings pleads not guilty to assault and hate-crime charges .

"(CNN) -- Twenty four hours after collecting his â‚¬80,000 ($100,000) pension lump sum on May 15, Spiros, a retired Greek public servant, called his London-based brother-in-law for his bank details. Within two weeks, Spiros had transferred a large chunk of the money, which he'd saved over a 30-year career in the armed forces, to his relative. Spiros feared his savings would be destroyed if he left them in Greece. He wanted to protect himself from a ""Grexit"" -- the term coined for the country's exit from the eurozone -- and the likelihood of that slashing the value of his money. ""I had never wanted to move my money abroad it but I was forced to do it,"" says Thessaloniki-born Spiros, sounding depressed as he described everyday life in his crisis-struck homeland. ""We're living in constant uncertainty and we don't know if there is going to be food on the table or if we're going to be able to pay for our children's university studies. We don't want to see our children sacrificed and pay for the mistakes of the politicians."" Greece's financial crisis: The human cost . The father of three says Greece's leaders have failed their people. Spiros says finding a safer haven for his savings was the ""last option"" that came ""out of the necessity"" to safeguard the future of his family. ""I've always paid my taxes,"" he says. ""This is now a way of protecting our family since the state is not protecting us."" Greece, the country whose collapsing finances triggered the eurozone debt crisis, is facing its fifth year of recession. It heads to the polls Sunday for the second time in six weeks. The first vote ended with stalemate with no party able to form a coalition. This next vote is crucial; it could change not only the course of Greece, but all of the 17-country eurozone. The weekend which could change the world . The race between the pro-bailout New Democracy party and the anti-austerity package Syriza coalition appears to be tight. But should the country remain in political limbo, it risks a disorderly default on its next bill payment. If Greeks vote against austerity there's a risk the international money that is bailing out Greece will stop flowing. If they vote for austerity there's no guarantee that conditions will improve. After nearly three years of painful measures Greece's economy has sunk further into recession. Further, unemployment for youth under age 25 jumped from 30.2% in the first quarter of 2010 to more than 52% in the first three months of this year, according to Eurostat figures. Amid the political turmoil and economic insecurity, many Greeks are simply looking to safeguard their money. Analysts have estimated a ""Grexit"" and subsequent return to the drachma, Greece's currency before the euro, could drastically cut the value of existing cash. What will Greek elections mean for the country's future? Spiros is one of many Greeks unwilling to risk their savings. The Greek banks are bleeding cash: according to Bank of Greece figures, total deposits in the country fell by nearly 25% from June 2010 to April this year. On May 14, uneasy Greeks pulled about â‚¬800 million out of local banks, prompting Greek President Karolos Papoulias to relay a message given to him by the country's Central Bank Governor George Provopoulos: Panic was possible. But a major bank run could potentially trigger the collapse of Greece's banking sector, which could then prompt Greece to leave the single currency, analysts say. ""Greek bank deposits have been falling for a number of years now, this is not particularly new,"" Jonathan Loynes, chief European economist at Capital Economics says. ""But there would appear to be clear signs of acceleration of a trend over the last few weeks."" The rise and fall of the euro . He believes people are driven by fears over a potential return to the drachma -- but warns widespread withdrawals run the risk of creating a self-fulfilling prophecy. ""If they're pulling their money out then that de-stabilizes the banking system and the economy further,"" says Loynes. ""Then of course there's a danger that it becomes self-fulfilling that actually makes a Greece exit more likely."" Anxiety on the streets of Greece is being exacerbated by the absence of any precedent for exiting the currency. Different scenarios have surfaced -- including a return to the drachma, or having a Greek-specific euro -- but no one knows what the repercussions of a eurozone exit will be. ""We don't know what our fate is going to be,"" says Eirini, a 53-year-old public relations worker from Athens, echoing a widespread sentiment in Greece's capital. So far, she has left her savings in Greece but intends to transfer a large portion of her savings to the bank account of her daughter in the UK. ""This will certainly make me feel more secure,"" says Eirini, adding that many of her friends and relatives have already withdrawn their money from Greek banks. ""This feeling of the unknown is frightening us,"" she says. ""We never imagined that something like this would happen -- it's something unprecedented and we're all shaken."" Family tragedy tells the story of Greece . At the same time, Greeks struggling under the austerity measures are being warned that an exit could bring even greater woes than those they are living with. Late last month the National Bank of Greece warned an exit ""would lead to a significant drop in the living standards of Greek citizens."" According to the bank, an exit could cut average income by 55%, while any new currency would depreciate 65% against the euro. The recession would deepen by 22%, says the bank, pushing up inflation and sending unemployment levels even higher than their current 21.9%. Amid the gloom, nervous savers simply want to keep their money safe, according to Danai, a broker from Athens who also has moved some of her savings offshore. ""If there's a switch from euro to drachma nobody can say with certainty what's going to happen,"" she says. Meanwhile Spiros is determined to buffer his family against this uncertainty despite his deep patriotism. ""I love my country and I've always saw myself being in the frontline, especially now that the times are difficult. But our leaders have betrayed us,"" he says. ""We have a responsibility towards our country but we also have a responsibility towards our families.""","Fears of a eurozone exit have fueled withdrawals of savings from Greece .

"(CNN)  -- For Elke Kennedy, the significance of Wednesday's hate crimes legislation can be traced to a single punch outside a bar on a drunken night two years ago. ""My son was murdered as he was leaving a bar in Greenville, South Carolina,"" the 48-year-old woman told CNN about her son, Sean, who was 20 when he came face-to-face with what she calls a hate crime. ""He walked outside the bar and there was three people sitting in a car outside and they called him over to ask him for a cigarette."" It was 3:45 a.m. on May 16, 2007, and her underage son was legally drunk, but not so much that he couldn't give them the cigarette. He did so, then turned to walk away. He did not get far, she said. ""As he was walking away, the guy in the back seat got out and walked over to Sean and called him a faggot and punched him in the face."" The men got back into their car and drove off, leaving Sean on the ground, his brain separated from his brain stem, she said. Fifteen minutes later, the 18-year-old assailant called one of the women whom Sean had been with in the bar and left a message on her cell phone. ""You tell your faggot friend when he wakes up he owes me 500 dollars for my broken hand,"" the message said. Sean was taken to Greenville Memorial Hospital, where he was pronounced brain dead 17 hours later. More than 700 people showed up at his memorial service at Crossroads Community Church in nearby Simpsonville. Two days later, Stephen Andrew Moller, then 18, was charged with murder. He bargained it down to involuntary manslaughter and served 199 days in the county lockup followed by 12 months in prison, Kennedy said. Moller was released on probation last July, she said. An attempt to reach the Moller family Tuesday was not successful. Had hate crimes been a federal offense in 2007, the FBI would have been able to investigate the attack, and Sean Kennedy's killer might still be in prison, his mother said. For the past 27 months, Kennedy has logged 76,000 miles speaking at colleges and clubs across the country trying to raise awareness and gather support for the legislation. Last week, the Senate did what she was seeking when it passed legislation by 68-29 that would make it a federal crime to assault an individual because of his or her sexual orientation or gender identity. Obama is to sign the measure, which was added to a $680 billion defense authorization bill, on Wednesday. Kennedy and her husband were driving Tuesday night from their home in Greenville to the nation's capital, where they were planning to witness the ceremony. ""We are going there representing so many people,"" she said. ""People who have been murdered and are dealing with the harassment and bullying and violence on a daily basis."" But Kennedy said her work does not end with the president's signature. ""This is a huge milestone, but it is not the end of the fight,"" she said. ""We have to change the hearts and minds."" Toward that end, she has spoken at 34 colleges and universities ""to educate these kids about what hate and violence and bullying can do and give them options and teach them non-violent conflict resolution."" But she expressed frustration that elementary schools have not allowed her to address their students, to send them the message that ends each of her talks: ""No mother should ever have to bury her child, no mother should ever have to lose her child to hate or violence and no mother should ever have to fight for justice for her child."" The measure is named for Matthew Shepard, a gay Wyoming teenager who died after being kidnapped and severely beaten in October 1998, and James Byrd Jr., an African-American man dragged to his death in Texas the same year. Several religious groups have expressed concern that a hate-crimes law could be used to criminalize conservative speech relating to subjects such as abortion or homosexuality. But Attorney General Eric Holder has said that any federal hate-crimes law would be used only to prosecute violent acts based on bias, as opposed to the prosecution of speech based on controversial racial or religious beliefs. Former President George W. Bush had threatened to veto a similar measure. Opponents of the expanded hate crimes bill challenged the need to specify one particular community in federal legislation. They contended that existing federal hate-crimes laws were sufficient to protect the rights of people based on sexual orientation and gender identity. More than 77,000 hate crime incidents were reported by the FBI between 1998 and 2007, or ""nearly one hate crime for every hour of every day over the span of a decade,"" Holder told the Senate Judiciary Committee in June.","Elke Kennedy says her son was called a ""faggot"" and then punched -- he died after assault .

"(CNN) -- A little boy named Jack, adopted from Russia several years ago as a toddler, celebrated Father's Day this year with his family in my home state of Minnesota. Jack is now 8. Across the ocean, his little brother Teddy, 5, didn't even know it was Father's Day. He simply woke up and lived yet another day of his life in a state orphanage, dreaming of his brother and the parents he met last year, knowing that they are waiting for him in a home somewhere far away. Jack's parents found out about Teddy too late to adopt the two brothers together. But as soon as they learned about Teddy, they knew they would adopt him, too. They were still in the midst of a drawn-out, three-year process to adopt Teddy when on December 28, Russian President Vladimir Putin signed into law a ban on all American adoptions of Russian orphans. The news of the ban devastated hundreds of children and families like Jack and Teddy's. Dozens of families were only days or weeks away from flying to Russia for the final court date that would have allowed them to bring their child home. Many of these families have shown me pictures of these children they already love so much. These are children who have known only the life of an orphanage since birth and whose disabilities make it unlikely that Russian families will adopt them. These orphans now sit and wait, clinging to photos of their American parents, asking when their mama and papa will come for them. According to the United Nations Children's Fund, 740,000 children live in Russia without parental care. The Russian Ministry of Science and Education estimates that 110,000 of these children live in state orphanages . In contrast, only 7,400 domestic adoptions took place in Russia in 2011, with an additional 3,400 adoptions of Russian children by families from abroad. These numbers are tragic. For an orphan, there is no substitute for a family. Not even the best orphanage can provide a child what a loving mother and father can. Staff, not parents, run orphanages. And despite any government's best intentions, hunger, neglect, extreme heat and cold and other forms of deprivation are common features of institutional life. But even more crushing is the lack of security, connection and deep emotional bonds that can grow only within a family. Children who grow up in orphanages tell stories of never having heard the words ""I love you"" and never receiving a single spontaneous hug throughout their childhood. A government can pay someone to wash and feed children, but it cannot pay someone to love them. Children with disabilities face an even bleaker fate. For a host of reasons, children with disabilities are rarely if ever adopted in Russia and elsewhere. Because of the harsh realities of institutional life -- limited staff; scant resources for food, utilities and other needs; little to no medical care -- a large percentage of orphans with disabilities do not even survive childhood. This means that for children with Down syndrome, cerebral palsy, blindness, deafness or other disabilities, being adopted by an American family may be the only chance they will have not only to receive specialized therapy and life-saving medical care but to know the unconditional love, acceptance and joy of being a cherished member of something special called family. It is these orphaned children -- the weakest of the most vulnerable -- whom the Russian adoption ban has punished. In June, I traveled to Russia with a bipartisan congressional delegation, taking part in meetings related to national security in the wake of the Boston Marathon bombings. We also made it a point to reiterate our profound hope that the Russian government will reconsider the adoption ban, and at the very least, allow for the completion of the cases for the children and families who were near the end of the adoption process. I emphasized in these meetings our desire to provide whatever post-placement reports and information might be necessary to provide the Russian government their desired assurances of the well-being of adopted children. I've also introduced a bipartisan resolution emphasizing much of the above, and most importantly calling on Russia to remember that every child deserves to be in a loving, protective and permanent family. I am confident that House leadership will move this legislation forward and that President Barack Obama and Secretary of State John Kerry will proactively reaffirm our commitment to building a better future for every child in desperate need of a family. Even in the complicated tides of modern political life, the weakest and most vulnerable members of society must never be forgotten or cast aside. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Michele Bachmann.","Michele Bachmann: Russia should lift its ban on American adoptions of Russian orphans .

"(CNN) -- ""Now we'll never know whether Tony Soprano got whacked or not."" This, believe it or not, was how somebody on a social networking site greeted last night's shocking news of James Gandolfini's death, at 51, of a heart attack while vacationing in Europe. The first thing you want to say to this is: Really? Six years have passed since the last episode of ""The Sopranos"" left the fate of its psychically damaged crime boss and suburban patriarch to speculation -- and you still want closure after all this time? Is that really the first thing you thought about after someone died so young, so unexpectedly? On the one hand, this sounds at best shallow and at worst callous. It is true, of course, that Tony Soprano, one of the great characters in American television and folklore, was indeed the role of a lifetime, for which Gandolfini was deservedly honored with multiple Emmys, unanimous acclaim and the type of reverberating legacy that is rarer than awards or praise. (It may be somewhat premature to call this immortality, but we'll see in another 30 years or so.) Appreciation: James Gandolfini, a pure actor . It is also true that in what turns out to have been a painfully brief time, Gandolfini had also distinguished himself in many roles on stage and screen in which his gruff, bearish demeanor proved adaptable enough to play everything from a well-heeled New York parent in the 2009 Broadway production of ""God of Carnage"" to the recalcitrant father of an aspiring rocker in ""Not Fade Away,"" last year's movie-directorial debut of ""Sopranos"" creator David Chase. He could also veer into the offbeat with surprising results, making a poignant impression while giving wounded, anxious voice to one of the beasts in Spike Jonze's 2009 movie adaptation of ""Where the Wild Things Are,"" a film I liked better than most of my fellow film critics did at the time. In last year's ""Zero Dark Thirty"" he made a deeper impression playing CIA director Leon Panetta than his relatively brief screen time would have suggested. It was the resume of the consummate character actor. And yet, it's just possible that only an actor as versatile and magnetic as Gandolfini could have rendered a character as complicated, forbidding and intimately familiar as Tony Soprano powerfully enough to have raised the bar for dramatic television. David Chase set the table for his quirky crime series by giving his menacing main character a streak of emotional vulnerability so deep and wide that he needed psychotherapy to cope with the consequences of his actions -- and the often trauma-inducing behavior of his family members. Galdolfini left his mark on New Jersey . And for all the tough talk, squalid activities and violent reprisals endemic to his profession, Tony was also flummoxed by life as a well-heeled New Jersey businessman trying to get his daughter into a decent college, his son into a better (less illicit) line of work and his wife to accept his peccadillos and keep the household together while he tried to keep his motley troops in line and the authorities at bay. One minute he could scare you (and his shrink) with his flashes of intense anger; the next minute he made you empathize with his obsessive fascination with the wildlife (ducks, bears, etc.) wandering into his spacious backyard. He was both a dedicated thug and a lost soul, a philandering sociopath who lugged his own unwieldy, twisted sense of propriety and honor. It was this tension between Tony's warring selves that, as much as any of the show's other virtues, kept millions of viewers riveted to ""The Sopranos"" for six seasons. It also broadened the possibilities for new dramatic series featuring lead characters with similarly conflicted morals and sordid deeds. In other words: Without Tony Soprano, there would be no Don Draper of ""Mad Men"" (created by ""Sopranos"" writer Matthew Weiner) or Walter White of ""Breaking Bad."" From the mouth of Tony Soprano: Best quotes . And without James Gandolfini bringing his own intelligence, charisma and intuitive graces to Tony Soprano's portrayal, television might have been more resistant to the deeper, more complex drama that has catapulted the medium to being the main event in American popular culture. Gandolfini, known among fellow actors and others for his generosity of spirit toward others, gave all of us a gift that will keep on giving for generations. The real regret, the awful, terrible knowledge that informed so many grief-stricken tributes online Wednesday, is not that we'll never know what happened to Tony Soprano at that last supper. It's that we'll never have a chance to see all the other wonderful gifts we would have received from the man who brought him to riveting, haunting life. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Gene Seymour.","Gene Seymour: James Gandolfini helped elevate the medium of dramatic television .

"(CNN)  -- Two people were arrested and 12 others were taken into custody Tuesday following a police chase in Phoenix, Arizona, in what authorities described as a human smuggling incident. ""The truck arrived into the U.S. just this morning from Mexico,"" said James Holmes, spokesman for the Phoenix Police Department. ""It is a human smuggling incident."" The chase began in southeast Phoenix at about 5:15 a.m. and wound up on the city's west side, said Robert Bailey, spokesman for the Arizona Department of Public Safety. Fourteen people were in the truck -- nine in the truck's bed, three in its extended cab and two up front, Bailey said. All were undocumented immigrants, he said. The truck's driver along with its owner, who was also in the vehicle, were arrested and face charges of human smuggling and felony flight, Bailey said. Authorities attempted to stop the truck after officers saw it tailgating other motorists on Interstate 10 westbound, Holmes said. The truck pulled over, then took off as a Department of Public Safety officer approached. The officer chased it but backed off as instructed after the truck began driving erratically, he said. Police lost the truck, and a chopper from CNN affiliate KNXV-TV in Phoenix helped them find it, Holmes said. Meanwhile, the truck also happened to pull up next to another Department of Public Safety officer and took off again, using surface streets for a while and getting on and off the interstate, nearly running over a motorcycle officer, Holmes said. Phoenix police finally stopped the truck. ""One after another, people start getting out,"" Holmes said.

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- The Justice Department and federal prosecutors will investigate allegations of discrimination against Latinos by police in Suffolk County, New York, officials said. The new investigation will seek evidence of whether the Suffolk County Police Department failed to act on complaints made by members of the Latino community or evidence of any other discriminatory practice, Robert Nardoza, spokesman for the U.S. attorney's office in the Eastern District of New York, said Tuesday. The inquiry by the Justice Departments Civil Rights Division and prosecutors was announced Monday. Both had said in January that they were monitoring prosecutions of hate crimes against Latinos in Suffolk County. In November, seven teenagers were arrested in connection with what authorities said was the racially motivated stabbing death of 37-year-old Marcelo Lucero of Patchogue, New York. All seven were charged with gang assault, and the alleged leader of the attack was charged with manslaughter. Lucero's death drew national attention. ""We became involved because we thought that the charges filed originally by the police department did not meet with the facts of the case,"" said Cesar Perales, president and general counsel of New York-based LatinoJustice PRLDEF: specifically, that the youths were not charged with murder. LatinoJustice PRLDEF, founded in the early 1970s as the Puerto Rican Legal Defense and Education Fund, petitioned the Justice Department to investigate Suffolk County police. Lucero's stabbing also prompted the Southern Poverty Law Center to undertake an investigation in Suffolk County. After four months of research and interviews with more than 70 Latino immigrants, 30 local religious leaders, human rights activists, community organizers and small business owners, the center said in a report last month that a pattern of ethnic intolerance was clear. ""The Lucero murder, while the worst of the violence so far, was hardly an isolated incident,"" the report said. ""Latino immigrants in Suffolk County are regularly harassed, taunted, and pelted with objects hurled from cars. They are frequently run off the road while riding bicycles, and many report being beaten with baseball bats and other objects. Their houses and apartments are egged, spray-painted with racial epithets and riddled with bullets in drive-by shootings."" In its report, the center cited hostile statements and policies issued by local officials -- including County Executive Steve Levy, the county's top elected official -- and county legislators as evidence that discriminatory attitudes are institutionalized. The organization also found what it called a trend of ""racial profiling, selective enforcement and outright bullying,"" specifically in the Suffolk County Police Department. ""We were told stories that are absolutely hair-raising,"" said Mark Potok, director of the law center's Intelligence Project and editor of the report. Suffolk County Police Commissioner Richard Dormer said law center researchers did not speak with him during the course of their investigation. ""I have to be honest with you,"" he said. ""The Southern Poverty Law Center is a very prestigious organization, very well-known. They have done good work over the years, but to be honest with you, this is sloppy work. Many of the allegations are incorrect and inaccurate."" In January, hate-crime charges were extended against the seven teens charged in Lucero's death to include other assaults on Latino men. ""When these defendants were indicted for their specific roles in the murder of Marcelo Lucero, most of the defendants admitted they had committed other attacks targeting Hispanic victims, a practice they described as 'beaner hopping,' "" Suffolk County District Attorney Thomas Spota said in a statement at the time. Justice Department spokesman Alejandro Miyas said the department hopes police will cooperate with the inquiry and work with investigators. ""We will study their practices and see if there's anything there that constitutes a violation,"" he said. ""We welcome the chance to sit down with the DOJ and U.S. attorney's office,"" Dormer said. ""It gives us the chance to dispel a lot of the myths of how we report and investigate hate crimes in Suffolk County."" ""We have very good relationship with our minority community,"" Dormer said. ""We're very proud of the way the police department interacts with our minority communities.""","Investigation will look for evidence of such practices in Suffolk County, New York .

"Centennial, Colorado (CNN) -- A shackled James Holmes, his hair still dyed red, heard prosecutors say Thursday he made threats at the University of Colorado a month before he allegedly opened fire at a Denver-area movie theater. Prosecutors, without stating the source of their information, also said Holmes, 24, failed to pass oral exams and chose to severe his relationship with the school, where he had been a Ph.D. candidate studying neuroscience. Holmes withdrew from the program in June, weeks before the shooting in Aurora. Prosecutors said the threats by Holmes were reported to campus police. Colorado shooting suspect's writings offer insight as student, aspiring scientist . The statements came as defense attorneys and prosecutors wrangled Thursday over access to records and documents. The main issue was whether the prosecution should receive non-medical documents from the university. These would include admissions forms, grades and transcripts. Victims and family members sat on one side of the courtroom. One woman was visibly shaking while another teary-eyed woman was comforted by a companion. Dark roots were visible in Holmes' hair; he now has a mustache and large muttonchop sideburns. While he appeared more lucid than his first appearance, Holmes still had a wide-eyed look. He did not speak at the hearing. Holmes is accused of opening fire July 20 during a midnight premiere of the latest Batman movie, leaving 12 dead and injuring 58 others. He has been charged with murder and attempted murder, and faces two weapons charges. The defense argued that the prosecution's request for records was too broad. Public defender Dan King called the request ""nothing more than a fishing expedition"" and said matters pertaining to his client's personal life were not relevant. King also asserted that the state likely has seen school documents. The judge did not issue an immediate ruling. Judge orders key records sealed, others released in theater rampage . The University of Colorado earlier this month said it hired a former U.S. attorney to conduct an independent review into how the school handled Holmes. A court document revealed that Holmes was a patient of CU psychiatrist Lynne Fenton before the killings. She was so concerned about his behavior that she mentioned it to her colleagues, saying he could potentially be a danger to others, CNN affiliate KMGH reported earlier this month, citing sources with knowledge of the investigation. Fenton's concerns surfaced in early June, sources told the Denver station. They told KMGH that Fenton contacted several members of a ""behavioral evaluation and threat assessment"" team to say Holmes could potentially be a danger to others, the station reported. The ""BETA"" team consists of ""key"" staff members from various university departments who have specific expertise in dealing with assessing potential threats on campus, the school says on its website. ""Fenton made initial phone calls about engaging the BETA team"" in ""the first 10 days"" of June but it ""never came together"" because in the period Fenton was having conversations with team members, Holmes began the process of dropping out of school, a source told KMGH.

"(CNN) -- New York University's 2010 graduating class owed a total of more than $600 million in student loans. It's unlikely the university will forgive them. But NYU has forgiven portions of mortgages they have extended to President John Sexton, other university executives or star faculty -- money that has been used to buy properties in Manhattan or vacation homes in the Hamptons. Does this shock you? Or, how about this: Treasury Secretary Jack Lew, a former executive vice president at NYU, received an ""exit bonus"" of $685,000. Just to put this in perspective, Lew's NYU exit bonus alone would have provided free tuition for 34 undergraduates. The revelations about lavish compensation packages at New York University (my alma mater) have raised a firestorm of criticism. Faculty critics have already publicized NYU's top executive salaries: Sexton takes home nearly $1.5 million, Vivien Lee, the vice dean of science gets $1.1 million, and Robert Grossman, the dean of the medical center, makes a whopping $3.5 million. And, as Ariel Kaminer reported in The New York Times, sometimes the salaries don't stop when the job ends. Exit bonuses and forgivable mortgages on townhouses, condos and vacation homes not only allow these top dogs to meet the standard of living of the 1%, but also to sock away real estate profits and rental income for the future. As it turns out, NYU also makes some of these payments off the official university books through a series of nonprofit foundations. In some cases, the university has written second mortgages -- also forgivable -- on property already purchased through the foundations. Sure, other universities have found ways to woo high-level executives, faculty and coaches with big salaries, severance pay, cars and real estate. For example, the University of Texas has maintained a Law Foundation similar to those at NYU. It provided mortgages and other forms of compensation, doled out over time, to encourage faculty to remain at the university. These practices, and the secrecy surrounding them, are under investigation by the Texas Attorney General's office. But NYU is in the media spotlight because giving loans to university executives and stars to purchase vacation homes is nearly unheard of, according to some experts. Is the university setting precedent for a new kind of extravagant spending? In January 2012, Vice President Joseph Biden carelessly -- and incorrectly -- remarked that high faculty salaries were driving escalating college tuition. This is a popular blame-game among politicians and university administrators alike. But according to the American Association of University Professors, in 2012 full-time faculty at all ranks across the nation received an average increase of 1.8%. In real dollars, this was the equivalent of lowering salaries by 1.2%. In comparison to a decade ago, AAUP salary data shows the rate of increase in faculty raises barely budged. In faculty lounges, the phrase ""corporate university"" is used to describe the negative ways that higher education, including the conditions under which the majority of faculty is employed, has been shaped by the business practices that trustees steeped in the culture of Wall Street bring to the campus. The corporate university eliminates full-time teaching jobs whenever possible. It relies on temporary academic laborers who have few or no benefits and median salaries of $2,700 per course, salary stagnation for the majority of academic and nonacademic employees, the reduction or elimination of union jobs, and the outsourcing of essential services to corporate providers who pay minimum wage or less. These changes have been accompanied by the creation of massive endowments. NYU's endowment was reported at $2.755 billion in 2012. This is only the 24th largest private endowment in the United States. I remember a time when administrators were called deans, provosts, treasurers and registrars -- now it seems everybody is a vice president. With these titles have come higher salaries, bonuses, company cars, low-interest mortgages and severance payments for voluntary departures. Boards of trustees approve these lavish practices even as they fight unionization, eliminate full-time faculty positions, refuse even cost-of-living raises for the majority of workers, increase tuition and ask students and their parents to take out tens of thousands of dollars in loans. What kind of bookkeeping permits contemporary universities to call themselves nonprofits when they are creating significant profits that go toward benefiting the financial aspirations of a few elite employees? The investigation into NYU should pry open the door to a world of accumulation and mismanagement in universities. Higher education is in need of ethical and fiscal reform, but it can't happen unless we start at the top. Editor's note: An earlier version of this essay misstated how much free tuition Jack Lew's exit bonus would have provided for undergraduates at NYU. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Claire Potter.","A Times article revealed that NYU executives are given loans for buying vacation homes .

"(CNN) -- On Friday, Pope Francis announced the canonization of two of his predecessors: Pope John Paul II (pope from 1978 to 2005) and Pope John XXIII (1958-1963). That John-Paul II, whose pontificate dominated the late 20th century, is on a fast-track to sainthood should not come as a surprise. At his death in 2005, the crowds chanted, ""Santo subito!"" (sainthood now!). The Vatican verified his first miracle, the curing of a French nun of Parkinson's, from which he also suffered, just two months after his death. He was beatified in 2011 and his second miracle, the healing of a Costa Rican woman with an aneurism after her family prayed at one of his shrines, was ratified that same year. John XXIII's canonization, however, was not on the radar, but it makes sense. John presided over the Second Vatican Council, the great midcentury meeting that completely transformed modern Catholicism, and which is now celebrating its 50th anniversary. Pope Francis has emphasized the divine nature of this council's work frequently over the last few months and has waived the requirement that two miracles be credited to his intervention. A Vatican spokesman emphasized that because ""no one doubts"" John's holiness, Pope Francis has decided to move forward with the dual canonization. (Early Italian reports suggest December 8, a Sunday this year, and the Feast of the Immaculate Conception, as the most likely date.) Why does a pope become a saint? At its most basic, Catholics believe, a saint is a holy person through whom God intervenes after his or her death to aid the living. Over the first 1,500 years of Catholic history, people generally became saints through popular acclamation rather than through a formal papal process. While there were some saints who were celebrated across the Christian world, the vast majority received only local or regional veneration. As with so many other Catholic procedures, the reform movements in the medieval papacy gradually asserted control of the process of canonization. In 1588, Pope Sixtus V instituted the ""Sacred Congregation of Rites,"" a body intended to take complete charge of all processes of beatification and canonization. However, local communities and religious leaders have always sought to promote their local holy men and women as saints, and often started venerating people regardless of official Vatican sanction. Pope John Paul II, in fact, oversaw the canonization of more people (483) than had been canonized in the previous 500 years, in part to lend the weight of Vatican authority to saints that had emerged throughout the global Catholic world. Seventy-eight of the 265 popes have been saints, which may seem like a large number, but this includes 52 out of the first 54 popes. After the sixth century, the rate of papal canonization rapidly decreased. By the time of the great medieval reform movements, most popes did not become saints and were not expected to do so, as sanctity became reserved for those not so deeply involved in worldly affairs. For example, Pope Celestine V may have become a saint, but he was recognized for his quiet life as a hermit, rather than for his brief life as pope (he was also an inspiration for Pope Benedict XIV's retirement). Over the modern era, pious leaders in local communities, people like Mother Teresa, and others of great piety outside the elite hierarchy were most likely to be recognized as saints. Thus, the incipient canonization of these two popes does stand out as unusual. So what's going on in Rome? I turn back to the lessons of the history: Decisions about sanctity almost always involve considerations about local contexts and contemporary needs. John Paul II's sainthood has been promoted by many of the more conservative elements within the Catholic world. John XXIII, however, is something of a hero to more liberal groups because of his sponsorship of Vatican II. Perhaps in linking these two pontiffs, Pope Francis is performing yet another act that emphasizes the continuity and the connections among Catholics of all kinds, a theme that has dominated his papacy so far. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of David M. Perry.","David Perry: Pope Francis announced the canonization of two predecessors .

"(EW.com) -- Let's play one final bass-drop requiem in memory of EDM. If the genre hasn't already been wub-wub-wub'd to death, Daft Punk would like to smother it with its own spirit hoodie. True, the duo's Thomas Bangalter and Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo helped spawn this new wave of harder, faster, stronger dance music â€” but lately, they've been slagging off that scene for its lack of imagination and its overreliance on preset sounds. Of course, that only makes Random Access Memories, their first proper album in eight years, feel more like a revelation: It features no electronics except for a modular synthesizer and some vintage vocoders, and uses only one sample. (A snippet from the Sherbs' ''We Ride Tonight'' opens the final track, ''Contact.'') Recorded in the studio with an orchestra, a children's choir, and an all-star cast that includes Pharrell Williams, Nile Rodgers, Julian Casablancas, Panda Bear, and Giorgio Moroder, it's a headphones album in an age of radio singles; a bravura live performance that stands out against pro forma knob-twiddling; a jazzy disco attack on the basic house beat; a full collaboration at a time when the superstar DJ stands alone. It's also quite moving; melancholy runs through every song. As the title suggests, RAM explores the way that memory is stored â€” on a hard drive or in your brain. Nostalgia is a major theme here, both in the music, which celebrates disco (first single ''Get Lucky''), funk (''Give Life Back to Music''), and classic sci-fi soundtracks (''Contact''), and in the lyrics, which often feature men of a certain age reckoning with the past. ''Giorgio by Moroder'' begins with the disco godfather recalling the days when he stayed out all night and slept in his car, while the music vividly evokes each decade he describes, building from a dramatic string section to record-scratching to a synth-pop finale that plays out like an epic laser-tag game. Later, Todd Edwards wants to ''feel like I'm 17'' on the pedal-steel daydreamer ''Fragment of Time,'' and the wistful ''Touch'' finds Paul Williams looking back on young love: ''I remember touch,'' he sighs through a vocoder, as spaceship sounds fire off. ''You've given me too much to feel/ You've almost convinced me I'm real.'' You don't know whether you're supposed to imagine him playing a sad HAL 9000 or a lonely astronaut. And maybe that's the point: It's hard to tell the difference between people and machines in dance music these days. But if EDM is turning humans into robots, Daft Punk are working hard to make robot pop feel human again. Grade - A . BEST TRACKS: .

"Washington (CNN) -- A top official in the Obama administration's Justice Department told a Senate panel Tuesday that he made a mistake in failing to warn Attorney General Eric Holder and other Justice executives about the controversial ATF tactic of allowing illegally purchased guns to ""walk"" across the border, into the hands of Mexico drug cartels. At a Senate Judiciary subcommittee hearing, Assistant Attorney General Lanny Breuer was grilled by Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa. Breuer acknowledged that in hindsight, he would have done things differently. Breuer's apologetic tone followed months of top Justice Department officials staunchly defending what they said was their minimal role in flawed operations by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives and denials of high-level involvement. Breuer said he learned of the tactic of allowing illegally purchased guns to leave gun shops in April 2010 regarding a previous operation known as Wide Receiver. ""I wish that at that time that I had said clearly to the deputy attorney general and the attorney general that in this case, Wide Receiver, we had determined in 2006 and 2007 guns had 'walked.' I did not do that, and I regret not doing that,"" Breuer admitted. Breuer had expressed his regret over his action in a statement late Monday. Operation Wide Receiver began in 2006 during the Bush administration. The controversial Operation Fast and Furious began in 2009 during the Obama administration and allowed illegally purchased firearms to ""walk"" from gun stores in Arizona across the border to drug cartels with the intent of monitoring the flow of weapons, but hundreds were lost or unaccounted for. The tactic led to a storm of outrage inside and outside the ATF when two of the missing weapons were found at the site where Border Patrol agent Brian Terry was killed in December. Breuer also admitted to Grassley he had failed to recognize that the same tactics used four years earlier were used again in Fast and Furious. ""I did not draw a connection between the unacceptable tactics used by the ATF years earlier in Operation Wide Receiver and those in Operation Fast and Furious and therefore did not alert others within Department leadership of any similarities between the two. That was a mistake, and I regret not having done so,"" Breuer said. As head of the criminal division, Breuer is one of Holder's most important assistants. Breuer's statement of regret came as the Justice Department sent 650 pages of documents to congressional investigators. The documents had been subpoenaed October 11 by Republican lawmakers angered by what they claim was stonewalling by the Justice officials. Grassley said at the hearing that the Justice Department officially assured him in February that allegations of gun walking in Fast and Furious were not true. ""However, as Mr. Breuer's admissions in yesterday's statement made clear, the Department's claim was not true,"" Grassley said. ""With every document that comes out, the Justice Department loses credibility and the faith of the American people,"" Grassley concluded.","Breuer said he learned of ""gun walking"" in 2010 regarding a previous operation .
That operation was known as Wide Receiver .
Later came Fast and Furious"" again with guns allowed to ""walk"" across the border .
""I did not draw a connection ... and therefore did not alert others,"" Breuer said ."
"(CNN) -- With a budget of $1.6 billion a year, a global staff of 14,000 and operations in 120 countries, Jasmine Whitbread could be in charge of a multinational corporation. In fact, she is head of the charity, Save the Children International. As the first global chief executive of the world's largest kids' not-for-profit, she leads the organization with the business acumen and astute professionalism of a Fortune 500 company. Founded at the beginning of the 19th-century by two sisters devoted to protecting children, its mission is to respond to humanitarian crises from Oklahoma to Syria. But in the long term, the organization's remit is centered around improving the way children are treated across the world. ""We want to play a role as a catalyst to really challenge some of these fundamental wrongs that can't be allowed to continue into the 21st century,"" says Whitbread. And with Whitbread at the helm, the charity is doing just that. In 2011, Save the Children increased funding and expenditure by 10% and helped 125 million children. ""Children shouldn't be going to bed hungry, they shouldn't be missing out on a basic education, these things are not expensive, they are not hard to solve."" There's no room for vague ideas of ""wanting to do good"" in a charity like Save the Children. ""We are just trying to help here,"" she says. ""I have heard that refrain from too many organizations and too many quarters where that help is actually doing harm so, I'm under no illusion that just the will to do something good (is) enough. ""We've got to be incredibly professional, we've got to be very impartial in our work and not be drawn on one side or the other. ""You can't just expect to be praised for doing good, you've got to be running a professional organization."" Alongside her visits to crisis-hit countries, she has met with business leaders at the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos. ""I do think it's a business where our bottom line is children's lives,"" says Whitbread, 49. ""We have to be the most efficient we can possibly be, we can't afford to be sloppy and just trying to do the right thing."" To engage with business leaders in Davos, Whitbread needs to emphasize the economic case for the charity's work. ""If I went around talking about children, I don't think that I would get very far,"" she says. ""But if I talk about young people, democratic dividend or the fact that many of these countries are now emerging markets with increasingly young potential workforces, business people can relate to that. It all depends on how you pitch it."" WEF is not only an opportunity to make the business case for the welfare of children, but it's also an ideal forum to strike up relations with companies keen to give back and be a part of the solution. This includes accepting pro-bono work from the likes of Boston Consulting Group to forming corporate partnerships with Bulgari, GSK, IKEA, Reckitt Benckiser and Unilever. Save the Children has been criticized in recent years, accused by some of being inefficient after Haiti's 2010 earthquake. ""If there is genuine criticism then we look at ourselves and say 'Ok, how could we be better coordinated? How could we be more efficient?'"" However, she added: ""Haiti was such a difficult place to be working with in the first place. Children weren't going to school, children were going to bed hungry before the earthquake. We didn't do a good job of managing the very high expectations that weren't going to be met. Watch: A crusader for children worldwide . ""We have got enrollment in school up to rates that were never the case before the earthquake, so I also think that sometimes the criticism can be unfair."" Whitbread grew up on the outskirts of London and -- apart from a spell volunteering in Uganda in her 20s -- she worked in business until the age of 36. In 1999, she left her job with Thomson Financial and moved her young family to Senegal in west Africa to become regional director for Oxfam. After six years with Oxfam, she made the switch to Save the Children, first as chief executive of the UK branch, and in 2010, became the organization's first international head. Since taking the post, Whitbread has worked to merge much of the work of the not-for-profit's 30 national organizations. It is not a job that affords much rest. Just back from the Democratic Republic of Congo and Sierra Leone, Whitbread is about to leave for North Korea. ""I try and keep the trips quite short because I do want to get home and spend some time with the family,"" she says. ""One of the great things about the work that I'm doing now is it's appropriate to bring one of my kids along sometimes. So my daughter came with me to India, my son to China, they've seen quite a bit of the world.""","Jasmine Whitbread is the first international chief executive of Save the Children .

"Madrid (CNN) -- Spain will create a new fiscal authority to oversee the new spending cuts, tax increases and structural adjustments included in a new budget presented Thursday. The country is in an economic crisis with an unemployment rate near 25%, and protests have grown against austerity measures, such as the ones included in the new budget. Despite the budget crunch, Vice President Soraya Saenz de Santamaria said there will be increases in pensions, scholarships and interest on debt. But the budget also includes large reductions in spending in an effort to reduce deficits. The budgets of all ministries will be reduced by an average of 12%, Saenz said. The package includes a ""road map"" of 43 proposed laws that will regulate and tweak various sectors of the economy to spur growth in weak areas and to maintain growth in stronger sectors. For the third year in a row, salaries of public workers will be frozen. ""This is a budget made in a time of crisis, but precisely to get out of the crisis,"" Saenz said. Spain, which has one of the largest economies in Europe, is fighting to bring down its huge deficit, which threatens the stability of the euro, the currency used by hundreds of millions of people across Europe. Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy said in July that the country would cut 65 billion euros ($83 billion) from the budget in three years by raising taxes and shrinking bureaucracy. But Spaniards have taken to the streets to demonstrate against austerity measures, and are expected to do so again after expected new cuts are unveiled. Clashes between police and demonstrators in central Madrid's Neptuno Square resulted in 28 people being hurt Tuesday, two of them police officers, a police spokesman said. The spokesman said 22 people among the estimated crowd of 6,000 had been arrested. Demonstrators said police were shooting into the crowd with rubber bullets; police would not comment. ""We have you surrounded,"" some demonstrators sang. ""We have no fear."" At one point, Spanish police charged demonstrators with batons to prevent them from approaching the parliament, which was in session. The protesters accused the government and the opposition alike of trying to solve the country's financial woes on the backs of the people. Video from the scene showed police charging groups of protesters with their clubs, but such clashes were isolated. Tuesday's protest seems to have been the most violent in the capital this year, but it was only one of an estimated 1,900 demonstrations in Madrid in 2012, according to government figures. The country is suffering from soaring borrowing costs, a banking system leaking cash and unemployment rates at devastating levels. It has been in recession since April, and analysts think the economic situation will get worse before it gets better. ""Growth is likely to be weak for a prolonged period,"" said Ben May, an economist at Capital Economics in London. ""More austerity will be needed."" The Bank of Spain said Wednesday that it expects economic activity in the second quarter to continue to weaken. It estimated that gross domestic product will shrink 1.3%. That would be the third straight quarter of contraction. 'Too big to fail, too big to bail' Greece may be the country risking expulsion from the eurozone, but Spain's situation is potentially of much greater concern. If such a major economy were to fail, the repercussions could cause unprecedented havoc across Europe -- and the globe. The Spanish economy is the eurozone's fourth-largest -- after Germany, France and Italy -- making up around 11% of the bloc's GDP. To put that in perspective, Greece, Portugal and Ireland -- the three eurozone countries that have already been bailed out -- combined make up less than 6% of the bloc's economy. Prime Minister Rajoy has tough targets to meet in order to cut the deficit. Michala Marcussen, an economist at Societe Generale, says ""substantial efforts"" will be required to meet a budget deficit target of 4.5%. Pension reforms are possible, such as fast-tracking plans to increase the retirement age to 67 from 65, while taxation and labor markets could also be targeted, Marcussen noted. The budget will be followed by Friday's release of the country's banking audit, which is expected to reveal details of the sector's financial needs. The consensus is that the banks need an injection of around 60 billion euros ($77 billion), and ""too low a number will raise concerns that there are more hidden losses to come -- all the more given the very frail economic backdrop,"" Marcussen wrote in an analysis. As it stands, the banks have an estimated 300 billion euros in problem loans on their books, with the full cost of recovery not yet clear. Eurozone finance ministers agreed in June to give aid to Spain's banking sector, but Rajoy has insisted that the government does not need a bailout. Spain, in its second recession since 2009, has been dubbed ""too big to fail, too big to bail."" The country also has an unemployment crisis, with more than half those younger than 24 out of work, and almost one in four people overall. Spain's jobless rate has helped pushed the eurozone's total unemployment rate to 11% -- its highest since the eurozone was created in 1999. Why is the economy collapsing now? The situation in Spain has developed like a perfect storm, with money being pulled out of the country, despite the desperate need to stem capital flight and support its banking system. This leaves Spain in a precarious financial state, driving investors away, pushing up its borrowing costs and making it more likely to need a bailout. It's a reminder of how governments are inextricably tied to their countries' banking systems, essentially the lifeblood of their economy. The struggles in Europe have been exacerbated by continued gloomy news out of the U.S. Al Goodman reported from Madrid, Irene Chapple from London and Catherine Tymkiw from New York. CNNMoney's Aaron Smith, Alfred Souza and Ben Rooney, and CNN's Tim Lister contributed to this report.","NEW: Government announces spending cuts, taxes .

"(CNN) -- Cristiano Ronaldo struck a last-minute winner to settle an absorbing Uefa Champions League contest as Spanish champions Real Madrid beat their English counterparts Manchester City 3-2 in the Santiago Bernabeu. Defeat was cruel on the visitors who looked set to end Madrid's remarkable record of never having lost an opening match at home in the Champions League and its forerunner, the European Cup, as City led 2-1 with three minutes left to play. Yet the Old Masters of Europe, who won the inaugural tournament in 1956 and whose tally of nine titles is unsurpassed, displayed all their experience as they finally sunk a team whose continental ambitions are being propelled by the wealth of Abu Dhabi-based owner Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan. Despite an injection of over £1.6 billion into the club in the last four years and taking the lead through substitute Edin Dzeko after 68 minutes, the Premier League side came away empty handed. After 76 minutes, Brazilian left back Marcelo equalized as his shot from the edge of the penalty area deflected off former Real Madrid player Javi Garcia before flying past City goalkeeper Joe Hart. The visitors thought they had won the game five minutes from time as a well struck free kick from Aleksandar Kolarov evaded a number of bodies in the box before creeping inside the far post. Madrid -- whose manager Jose Mourinho had publicly questioned his players' commitment before the match after the team's poor start to the Spanish league -- had other ideas as Karim Benzema fired home a fine goal before Ronaldo's last-minute strike somehow evaded both Hart and his centre back Vincent Kompany. In the other Group D tie, Germany's Borussia Dortmund -- whose sole Champions League triumph came in 1997 -- eventually put home advantage to good use as they sunk four time winners Ajax Amsterdam 1-0. The hosts had to wait until the 87th minute for their goal as Polish striker Robert Lewandowski crashed home from close range -- to ensure that the evening was not remembered for the missed penalty by teammate Mats Hummels just before the hour. Another team whose fortunes have been revived by the input of enormous wealth from the Middle East enjoyed a far more comfortable night as Paris Saint Germain beat the Ukraine's Dynamo Kiev 4-1 in the French capital. PSG had not appeared in Europe's leading club competition since making a tame group stage exit in 2004 but last year's purchase of the club by the Qatar Sports Investment group soon changed that unwanted record. The Qataris spent £112 million on players in the summer and two of their headline arrivals -- Swedish striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Brazilian defender Thiago Silva -- scored in a convincing Group A victory. Ibrahimovic converted a penalty to become the first player to score for six different clubs in the Champions League and shortly after, Silva -- who was making his debut after becoming the most expensive player in French football history (joining from AC Milan in a £34m move) -- doubled the lead. Silva's compatriot Alex added another after 32 minutes and although Miguel Veloso pulled one back for the visitors late on, Javier Pastore added the gloss to the win with a stoppage time strike. In the day's other Group A game, Portugal's two time winners Porto won 2-0 at Dinamo Zagreb of Croatia thanks to goals from Lucho Gonzalez and Steven Defour. Despite spending nearly £100m on just two players in the closing stages of the transfer window, Russians Zenit St Petersburg started their Group C campaign with a 3-0 defeat at Malaga. The Spanish side have encountered a troubled financial period in recent times after owner Sheikh Abdullah Bin Nasser Al-Thani, whose riches had turned the club from La Liga also-rans to Champions League debutants in just two years, suspended his injection of cash into the club. After a failure to pay wages, players such as Spain's double European champion Santi Cazorla and Dutch defender Joris Mathiksen left the club -- but locally born Alarcon Isco made light of their absences with two stunning strikes either side of a Javier Saviola tap in. Zenit, whose big-money purchases of Brazilian striker Hulk (who played) and Belgian midfielder Alex Witsel (who did not) were largely enabled by hefty backing from Russian company Gazprom, lie bottom of Group C after seven time champions AC Milan could only draw 0-0 at home to Belgian visitors Anderlecht. Elsewhere, Montpellier -- who were also making their Champions League debut -- went down 2-1 at home to Arsenal, the English side making their 15th consecutive appearance in the group stage of the competition. Highly rated Moroccan midfielder Younes Belhanda gave the French champions an early lead with a confident penalty but the Gunners staged a turnaround as quick as it was dramatic. After 16 minutes, Olivier Giroud -- who was returning to a club where his 21 league goals last season were crucial to Montpellier's first title -- teed up Lukas Podolski to slot home before Gervinho completed the scoring just two minutes later. Montpellier were unlucky not to win a penalty after Abou Diaby felled Remi Cabella, but Arsenal held on to go top of Group B with Germans Schalke 04, who beat Olympiakos 2-1 in Greece with goals from Benedikt Howedes and Klaas-Jan Huntelaar.","Real Madrid beat Man City 3-2 at home after last minute Ronaldo strike .

"Nairobi, Kenya (CNN) -- No one at the Railway Golf Club in the heart of Nairobi quite remembers if Barack Obama, Sr., the father of the 44th U.S. president, ever played here when he was a high-flying civil servant in the 1960s . Perhaps he played up the road at the Royal Nairobi Golf Club, the oldest of the city's six golf establishments, someone suggests. The club scene was certainly the natural ecosystem for the pipe-smoking Harvard-educated economist, and the hordes of other young Africans just returned from the world's top universities to take over their newly independent country. Map: World weighs in on U.S. election . Memories of Dr. Obama are fading, but his son is a popular man in Kenya. From the clubs to the teeming barrios for which Nairobi is notorious, President Obama is spoken of with enthusiasm and pride. Dr. Simeon Onyango, is in the pharmaceuticals business and a widely travelled man. He thinks the world of President Obama. ""I believe he deserves a second term. War is very expensive and with the Iraq and Afghan war, he has done a great job in managing this and even eliminating Osama [bin Laden],"" said Onyango at the Railways Golf Club, whose course is part of a longer green belt that girdles Nairobi's fat midriff from south to north. Postcard: Nigerians enjoy election soap opera . The Kenyan capital is a land of dramatic contrasts. From a rooftop bar on Mombasa Road, the main highway to the airport and on to the coast, you can sometimes see in the distance herds of buffalo, giraffe and the odd lion. Once in a while, when the big cats wander into the villages and kill their cattle, Maasai warriors take out their spears and hunt them down. It is a city that likes to keep in touch with its wild side. Kibera, Kenya's biggest slum, is Obamaland. Here, the people are less guarded, more passionate about politics. Their living conditions are terrible. They have given rise to a peculiar activity, slum tourism, where wealthy people journey from all over the world to come and see squalor. The ring of slums to the south co-exist cheek-to-jowl with Lavington, one of the city's wealthiest neighborhoods. Every morning crowds of workers stream through Lavington for their 15-kilometer walk to the city's industrial zone. Postcard: Obama finds support among Chavistas . In Kibera, Obama's story resonates strongly maybe because when you are scrapping the bottom of the barrel, the only thing keeping you going is a dream: the slum is home to amazing innovation and creativity in film, comedy, music and -- believe it not -- IT. James Mwanzia, 25, sells charcoal, used by thousands of poor household for fuel. ""The highlight of his term was killing Osama bin Laden, which is something other presidents have not been successful in doing,"" he says. Al Qaeda and its fanatical Somali affiliate, Al-Shabaab, which has been carrying out a campaign of terror in Nairobi and on one occasion lobbed a grenade into a Sunday school, is solidly hated. Postcard: Why Berliners, U.S. are kindred spirits . Unlike many Kenyans, Mwanzia didn't wake up at 4:00 a.m. to watch the second U.S. presidential debate on TV. Kenya will hold its own general election next March, and for the first time a series of presidential debates has been planned ahead of election day. He says he will watch the local ones. For Kenya's Muslims, however, the attitude towards America is more complex. Munir Mohammed Abbas, 35, another Kibera resident, is full of praise for Obama, whom he describes as ""a very eloquent speaker with a very good grasp of national matters, especially on managing the economy"" -- before adding, ""I will not comment on terrorism."" Postcard: War-scarred Baghdad has little faith in election . Among Muslims, there is suspicion that the fight against al Qaeda targets their religion -- and U.S. campaign talk of an invasion of Iran and the enthusiastic support for Israel are not popular ideas in the mosques. The thrill here over Obama's 2008 election has dwindled over time. ""Enthusiasm for President Obama is probably 40 percent what it was in 2008,"" said Henry Owuor, Foreign Editor of the Daily Nation, Kenya's biggest newspaper. ""People used to call and demand that I publish Obama's pictures and stories. Not any more."" In 2008, the Daily Nation sent a team to cover the U.S. election; this year it is relying on its correspondents and the wire services. While Obama is admired because he is smart, calm and dignified, a brave black man doing his duty for his country, he has been in office for four years and the novelty has worn off. Postcard: Obama's 'hope' a mirage for hostile Pakistanis . Kenyan perception of America has also changed over the years. The U.S. is recognized as a powerful actor not just in regional affairs, but in national affairs. There is a growing belief in Kenya that America exercises its immense power only in its own interest -- sort of like a wealthy friend who comes to a party with lots of food, but does not share. Last October, Kenyan forces crossed the border into Somalia in pursuit of Al-Shabaab. The region's first contact with jihadist terrorism was in August 1998 when al Qaeda bombed the U.S. embassies in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam. There was an outpouring of sympathy for America. But when Kenyan forces entered Somalia, the U.S. stayed out of it. James Thumi, who sells software, feels Obama has not been sufficiently engaged with Africa. While his predecessors had big initiatives such as the Global Fund to Fight Aids, Tuberculosis and Malaria, and the African Growth and Opportunity Act, which offers African companies preferential access to the U.S. textiles market, Obama has been pre-occupied with domestic issues. Postcard: Obama, Romney ignore Afghans at own peril . America also uses travel advisories to chide the Kenyan government for policies with which it disagrees, according to Thumi. ""Placing travel advisories on countries like Kenya because of a few security threats is not the way to go, because we do not do the same when America has had its share of scares,"" said Thumi, echoing the common perception that the U.S. government uses travel advisories, which discourage travel to countries at risk, as a big stick to get the Kenya government to do its bidding. In K'ogelo, a village about 400 kilometers west of Nairobi and the home of the Obamas, a victory party is being planned. At the Railway Club, golfers pay no heed to the scorching sun and are out on the green. In the club house, members speak quietly into their cell phones. A few are on their iPads, most likely keeping a worried eye on RealClearPolitics.com to see which ones are leaning and which ones are toss-ups.","President Obama's father, Barack Sr., was born in Kenya .

"(CNN) -- The Justice Department is preparing to sue Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio, known internationally as ""America's toughest sheriff,"" saying talks between the two sides have fallen through. The Obama administration and Arpaio's Maricopa County Sheriff's Office had been in the midst of settlement talks, after the Justice Department accused it of systematically discriminating against Latinos. As part of the settlement, the department wanted Arpaio to allow an independent monitor to oversee reforms at his office. The Justice Department called it a ""key, non-negotiable requirement."" The two sides were scheduled to meet Wednesday, but Arpaio called off the meeting at the last minute, the Justice Department said. ""We believe that you are wasting time and not negotiating in good faith,"" said Deputy Assistant Attorney General Roy Austin Jr. in a letter to Arpaio's legal counsel. It added: ""MCSO's refusal to engage in good faith negotiations requires us to prepare for civil action."" Arpaio shot back, saying he would not ""surrender"" his officer to the federal government. ""Appointment of an outside monitor essentially usurps the powers and duties of an elected Sheriff and transfers them to a person or group of persons selected by the federal government,"" he said in a statement Tuesday. ""And so to the Obama administration, who is attempting to strong arm me into submission only for its political gain, I say, 'This will not happen, not on my watch!'"" A federal Department of Justice investigation into Arpaio's office made public in December described ""a pervasive culture of discriminatory bias against Latinos at MCSO that reaches the highest levels of the agency."" Arpaio dismissed the allegations as a politically-driven ""witch hunt."" He pointed out how President Barack Obama opposed Arizona's controversial anti-immigration law and how the president mentioned Arpaio as the person pushing the law, the sheriff said. ""By the way, I don't want to say it's all politics, but everyone I'm talking about happens to be Democrats,"" said Arpaio, a Republican. Arpaio added: ""Don't come to use me as a whipping boy for a national, international problem."" The 22-page Justice Department letter alleged the Maricopa County Sheriff's Office committed federal and constitutional violations. Detention officers in Arpaio's jail invoked offensive slurs and profanities against Hispanics, calling them ""wetbacks,"" ""Mexican bitches,"" and ""stupid Mexicans,"" the letter said. ""Sheriff Arpaio's own actions have helped nurture MCSO's culture of bias,"" said the letter, written to the Maricopa County attorney. For example, the sheriff apparently endorsed one constituent's letter asking for a ""round-up"" at one Phoenix street corner of ""dark-skin(ned)"" people: Arpaio told a member of his command staff in a note to ""(h)ave someone handle this,"" the Justice Department said. Jack MacIntyre, Arpaio's deputy chief, described the Justice Department's allegations as ""a sneak attack by the federal government on the citizens of Arizona."" The Justice Department also said it is reviewing allegations that the sheriff's office did not investigate "" a large number of sex crimes. "" The sheriff's office has acknowledged to federal authorities that 432 cases of sexual assault and child molestation were not properly investigated over a three-year period ending in 2007, and many of the victims apparently were Latinos, the Justice Department said. The federal findings also alleged discriminatory policing practices by Arpaio's officers including ""unlawful stops, detentions and arrests of Latinos,"" according to a Justice Department statement. It also noted that the sheriff's office has discriminated against ""Latino inmates with limited English by punishing them and denying critical services."" It further blamed the office for allowing ""specialized units to engage in unconstitutional practices"" and for a lack of oversight and deputy training. The initial federal inquiry began in June 2008 and reviewed tens of thousands of pages of documents and more than 400 interviews, including current and former inmates as well as office personnel. Authorities notified the sheriff's office of a formal investigation a year later, a statement said. Assistant Attorney General Thomas Perez said the sheriff's office initially failed to cooperate with investigators, prompting federal authorities to take the ""virtually unprecedented step"" of filing a lawsuit in 2010. He noted the investigation had uncovered startling levels of racial profiling against Latino drivers, ranging between four and nine times higher than against non-Latino motorists. Perez added that an independent reviewer involved in the probe described it as ""the most egregious racial profiling in the United States"" he had ever seen.","The two sides had been in the midst of settlement talks .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The Justice Department Thursday announced it is dropping its controversial plan to allow officials to deny the existence of certain sensitive documents when confronted with thorny Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests. The provision in proposed FOIA regulations had stirred criticism from both ends of the political spectrum, from the American Civil Liberties Union and from other open-government groups. The decision was announced in a Justice Department letter to Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, who had led the fight against the rule change. ""We will not include that provision when the Department issues final regulations,"" the Justice Department said. In a letter to Attorney General Eric Holder last Friday, Grassley vowed to ""take all necessary steps"" to block the rule that would have allowed the government to ""deceive"" people about the existence of information. In its response, the Justice Department said the agency had in practice handled certain sensitive records as excludable since 1987, when then-Attorney General Ed Meese first issued guidance saying the best way to deal with these sensitive records was to deny they existed. Meese had specifically referred to narrow categories which dealt with national-security information and requests for information relating to an ongoing criminal investigation in which the target is unaware of a probe. The government said it was not really ""lying"" to declare that ""there exist no records responsive to your FOIA request."" The government maintains that specific was ""wholly accurate"" because in these sensitive cases the only records that exist are not subject to the FOIA act . Grassley, however, said a response that there are ""no records"" when such records, in fact, exist could undermine the public trust in government. Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vermont, was quick to applaud the decision to drop the proposed change. ""For five decades, the Freedom of Information Act has given life to the American value that in an open society, it is essential to carefully balance the public's right to know and government's need to keep some information secret,"" Leahy said. The ACLU also applauded the Justice Department decision. ""Government accountability can only be assured through transparency,"" said Laura Murphy, director of the ACLU Washington legislative office .","Former Attorney General Meese first issued guidance in 1987 on denying sensitive records exist .
That came in response to Freedom of Information requests for doucments .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- China has urged the Philippines to ""guarantee the safety and legitimate rights"" of fishermen who have been taken into custody for poaching after their vessel ran aground on the protected Tubbataha Reef -- the latest incident in often tense relations among nations in the South China Sea. Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hong Lei made his comments on Thursday, state-run Xinhua reported, a day after Philippine authorities formally charged 12 fishermen with poaching and attempting to ""corrupt public officials,"" the Tubbataha management office said in a news release. The 12 Chinese nationals were arrested on April 8 after their ship ran aground on the reef. The fishermen also faced administrative charges for for illegally entering Tubbataha Reefs Natural Park and for damage to the reefs. Crews will be sent to remove fuel from the 500-ton vessel to attempt to float it off the seabed, according to park authorities. The coral reef was the same that a U.S. Navy minesweeper ran aground and damaged the reef on January 17. Earlier this week, Philippine officials said they would be sending the U.S. government a $1.5 million bill for damage to the reef. READ MORE: Navy owes $1.5 million for damage to reef .

"Washington (CNN) -- The partisan impasse over potential contempt proceedings against Attorney General Eric Holder continues following a lengthy letter from the deputy attorney general, and a blunt response from the House Oversight Committee chairman. The latest volley started with a 13-page letter from Holder's deputy, James Cole, to committee Chairman Darrell Issa, R-California, arguing against contempt. ""A contempt proceeding would be unwarranted given the information the Justice Department has disclosed to the Committee to date,"" Cole wrote. He also called such an action ""unprecedented"" given the law enforcement issues, and ""ill-advised"" given the damage it would cause to relations between the executive and legislative branches of the government. In the letter, Cole repeated Holder's previous admissions that ""Operation Fast and Furious"" was fundamentally flawed as a solution to gun trafficking at the Mexican border. After months of congressional investigations, the Justice Department had acknowledged that its agency, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, made a serious tactical error in allowing guns to be purchased by straw buyers and then smuggled across the border to drug cartels. What was supposed to be a sting operation turned into a nightmare when about 1,000 firearms went missing during the operation and ended up in the hands of drug lords. The fiasco reached crisis proportions when a U.S. Border Patrol agent was slain in Arizona near the border in December 2010, and two of the missing weapons were discovered at the scene of the killing. Republicans in Congress have been demanding answers. Issa wants any document that could shed light on the operation. Cole says DOJ has sent tens of thousands of pages of documents, answered all the questions at hearing, and given the committee most of what it wants. But Issa says that's not enough. ""While the Committee has subpoenaed documents that address what senior officials were told about controversial gunwalking tactics during Operation Fast and Furious, the Justice Department pointedly refuses to provide them or to deny senior officials were given information in the course of the Operation indicating the existence of reckless tactics,"" a spokesman for Issa said Wedneday. Republican House members are expected to reach a decision on voting a contempt citation by the end of May, GOP officials say.","GOP House members are expected to decide on a contempt citation this month .

"(CNN) -- More than 200 people were reported killed in Syria, hours before the U.N. Security Council was scheduled to meet and likely vote on a draft resolution intended to pressure the government there to end its months-long crackdown on demonstrators, diplomats said. The meeting was scheduled to start at 10 a.m. ET Saturday. It was not clear which way Russia, a veto-wielding permanent member of the Security Council, would vote. The opposition Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said early Saturday that 217 people, including women and children, had been killed in Homs in what the group characterized as a ""massacre."" ""The U.N. isn't doing anything about it. The Arab League isn't doing anything about it ... While they're having their little discussion, people are sitting here and they're dying,"" said an activist CNN is identifying as Danny. ""These aren't animals here. These are human beings,"" he said. ""This isn't a game ... This is actually going on."" Of those killed in Homs, 138 were in the neighborhood of Khaldiya where ""shelling continues,"" according to the opposition group. ""A massacre happened in Homs today,"" said Abu Abdo Alhomsy, a resident. ""There are so many people on the streets that are wounded and they need help, but we can't reach them to help them."" He described ""continuous bombing"" and reported the presence of snipers. ""They're ready to kills us all. They have no problem with doing that. Please, we call (on) the international community for help,"" Alhomsy told CNN. State-run Syrian TV denied reports that the army shelled neighborhoods in Homs. ""This is a media campaign that uses fabrication, falsehood and escalation ... in order to affect a decision at the Security Council and cover crimes and attacks committed by armed terrorist groups,"" it said. Before the reports of shelling in Khaldiya, the Local Coordination Committees of Syria, a network of opposition activists, said that at least 31 people were killed across the country on Friday, including three children and three defected soldiers. CNN cannot independently confirm opposition or government reports from Syria because access to the country is limited. Meanwhile, a rights group said in a report Friday that Syrian army and security officers detained and tortured children with impunity during the past year. Human Rights Watch urged the Security Council ""to demand that the Syrian government end all human rights violations."" Syria must also be made to cooperate with monitoring teams sent by the Arab League and the U.N. Human Rights Council, the global monitor said. ""Children have not been spared the horror of Syria's crackdown. Syrian security forces have killed, arrested, and tortured children in their homes, their schools, or on the streets,"" said Lois Whitman, children's rights director at Human Rights Watch. The organization said it has documented at least 12 cases of children detained under inhumane conditions and tortured, as well as children shot while in their homes or on the street. A Security Council meeting on Syria ended Thursday evening without agreement on the text of the draft, according to U.S. Ambassador Susan Rice. The draft of the resolution discussed Thursday had dropped demands from an Arab League plan for Syria to form a unity government and for President Bashar al-Assad to delegate power to his deputy. ""We had what I would characterize as sometimes difficult but ultimately useful discussions,"" Rice said. ""We're still working. This is not done."" She said the Moroccans, who submitted the original draft, would come back with another version that could be voted on. ""In any case, there are some still complicated issues that our capitals will have to deliberate on and provide each of us with instructions on."" Before the talks, Arab League Secretary General Nabil Elaraby said that even a watered-down resolution would pressure the Syrian government. U.N. diplomats said the changes reflected a big concession to Russia, which has been reluctant to sign on to any plan that could be seen as a mandate for regime change in Damascus, as occurred in Libya after it signed a resolution calling for a no-fly zone. Russia, which has said it is concerned about the prospect of a Syrian civil war and does not want al-Assad pushed from power, has made clear that it will not accept an arms embargo or economic sanctions. A call for other nations to follow the Arab League members in adopting measures such as sanctions against Syria had also been dropped from the latest version of the draft resolution, which demands the Syrian government allow the delivery of humanitarian aid and guarantee the freedom of peaceful demonstrations. It also calls for an ""inclusive Syrian-led political process."" U.S. and European diplomats insisted that the revised text still fully endorsed the Arab League plan and that it did not need to spell out every detail to have the same meaning. ""It will still put pressure on the Syrian government, because they realize that Russia cannot stand up forever. And they are under great pressure now. And, you know, Russia does not want to be against the people,"" Elaraby said. In October, Russia and China issued a rare double-veto of a resolution that lacked sanctions but would have condemned the violence in Syria. At least 7,100 people, including 461 children, have died since the start of the Syrian uprising in March, according to the Local Coordination Committees. The United Nations estimated in December that more than 5,000 people have died since March. But the global body has not been able to update that figure because of the insecurity. CNN's Richard Roth, Mick Krever, Elise Labott and Salma Abdelaziz contributed to this report.","NEW: Syrian TV denies reports of shelling in Homs .

"(CNN) -- Walgreens will pay governments $7.9 million in a settlement reached amid allegations the drugstore chain illegally paid kickbacks so that prescriptions would be transferred to its pharmacies, the U.S. Justice Department announced Friday. Investigators had been looking into whether Walgreens had given people enrolled in government-run health programs -- such as Medicare, Medicaid and Tricare (for military families) -- $25 gift cards if they moved their prescriptions over to Walgreens' pharmacies, according to a Justice Department news release. Such inducements violate federal law, the department says. The drugstore chain's advertisements typically noted that such offers didn't apply to those insured via Medicaid, Medicare and similar programs. But the government claimed ""Walgreens employees frequently ignored the stated exemptions on the face of the coupons and handed gift cards to customers who were beneficiaries of government health programs."" The government learned of the allegations in lawsuits filed by two whistle-blowers: Cassie Bass, a pharmacy technician who worked at Walgreens in Detroit, and Jack Chin, an independent pharmacist in Florida. Federal prosecutors from California and Michigan, the U.S. Justice Department's commercial litigation branch, the National Association of Medicaid Fraud Control Units and the U.S. Health and Human Service Department's inspector general participated in the joint investigation. Bass and Chin will get about $1.28 million from the United States for their actions under parts of federal and state False Claims Acts statutes, according to the U.S. Justice Department. The federal government will receive just under $7.3 million from Walgreens as part of the settlement, with participating states also receiving some payment from the drugstore chain. ""This case represents the government's strong commitment to pursuing improper practices in the retail pharmacy industry that have the effect of manipulating patient decisions,"" said Stuart F. Delery, acting assistant attorney general with the U.S. Justice Department. On its website, Illinois-based Walgreens describes itself as the nation's largest drugstore chain with sales last fiscal year of $72 billion and 7,847 drugstores in all 50 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico.","Walgreens settles with authorities probing claims raised by whistle-blowers .

"Washington (CNN) -- With hundreds of communities nationwide forced to slash budgets and layoff police officers, the disclosure Thursday of which cities would receive federal grants to fund police positions had been eagerly awaited. Five hit the bureaucratic jackpot. Justice Department officials announced cities in virtually every state would receive anywhere from a single officer to a legal maximum of 50 police officers. In total, the COPS (Community Oriented Policing Services) program, administered by the Justice Department, announced it had divided the $298 million appropriation to fund 1,388 police positions. The five biggest recipients, each receiving grants for 50 officers, were Houston, Texas; Tucson, Arizona; Metro Dade County in Florida; the Sacramento, California, Sheriff's Department and the commonwealth of Puerto Rico. Federal funds will go for new police hires in those areas, except for Sacramento, which will use the funds to re-hire officers furloughed, officials said. Officials in charge of the program cited current crime rates and demonstrated financial need as key criteria for the funding. ""There is almost nothing more effective in keeping the public safe than cops on the beat who have the equipment and resources they need,"" said Associate Attorney General Tom Perrelli. Perrelli led the parade of officials announcing the grants at a ceremony in Houston. Left unsaid was the long list of cities that received little or no funding. A total of 4,423 police agencies had requested funds for more than 10,408 police officers. Officials acknowledge there remains a continuing hunger for federal assistance among state, county, and local law enforcement agencies. But for the cities that received funds, this was a day for quiet celebration. ""The officers that we will get through this program, through this grant, will be men and women to help us keep the city safe,"" declared Houston Police Chief Harold Hurtt.","The COPS (Community Oriented Policing Services) program is allocating $298 million .

"(CNN) -- Modern communications are an essential foundation for the social and economic opportunities that everyone deserves. The World Conference on International Telecommunications (WCIT), currently taking place in Dubai, is a golden opportunity to provide affordable connectivity for all, including the billions of people worldwide who cannot yet go online. It is our chance to chart a globally-agreed roadmap to connect the unconnected, while ensuring there is investment to create the infrastructure needed for the exponential growth in voice, video and data traffic. The conference is a landmark because, for the first time in a quarter-century, it is reviewing the International Telecommunication Regulations (ITRs) that govern international connectivity. Not surprisingly, there are many differing ideas about how this might be done, as well as hot debate on some proposals that have been put forward. There are 193 member countries of ITU, and all are free to express their views. However, no proposal to WCIT will be accepted unless it has very broad support. But there are more voices at WCIT than just those of government. The CEO of ICANN, Fadi Chehade, addressed the opening ceremony and emphasized the growing cooperation between his organization and ITU. And included among national delegations are dozens of representatives from industry and civil society. Read more: 'Father of the internet:' Why we must fight for its freedom . As the neutral convener of the conference and in an effort to engage opinion worldwide, ITU has encouraged all its membership (including over 700 private-sector entities), as well as civil society organizations and the press and public at large, to contribute their views. Much of the conference itself is webcast. WCIT is not a ""closed-door"" event. In fact, compared with other intergovernmental meetings of such importance, WCIT is as open as it possibly can be. ITU has always sought a multi-stakeholder approach. In 2003 and 2005 we led the way with the World Summit on the Information Society, which -- for the first time -- brought all sides together to debate how transformational information and communication technologies (ICTs) should shape the future. We expect the same kind of constructive cooperation to occur at WCIT. It is crucial that the Internet is not only kept open for business, but is also opened for everyone. We can then continue to innovate and gain the vast benefits that result from access to knowledge. Read more: Why aren't robots doing my dishes yet? In all countries there are circumstances when authorities intercept or block communications that are viewed as criminal or dangerous. This is permitted under articles in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which is part of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and in the ITU Constitution. However, these are exceptions to the basic principle enshrined in those documents: The right to freedom of expression and communication. The ITRs must conform to the ITU Constitution, and nothing in the revised treaty can diminish that fundamental right to free speech. Read more: Lockitron: The app that unlocked crowd-funding success . But you need a means of communication to exercise that right. At present, two-thirds of people globally have no Internet access, and far fewer benefit from broadband. This is often forgotten by the other third, but the stark truth is that Internet is still a privilege of the minority. I spoke out recently when Internet access was shut down in Syria amid understandable outcry. What mostly went unreported is that 80% of Syrians never had access to the Internet in the first place. This underscores our need to prioritize giving people access to ICTs. The solution requires partnership between the public and private sectors, within frameworks that encourage innovation alongside investment in areas where it is needed most. Considering measures to achieve this is one of the most important items on WCIT's agenda. More details of all major topics are available via the ITU website. ITU's development of technical standards, alongside the work of others, has played a key role in enabling connectivity and interoperability in today's powerful technologies of mobile including optical fiber, television, video compression, mobile, broadband and Internet. I believe that broadband in particular can be the engine that drives progress, but without ITU standards on, for example, transport mechanisms to carry information around the world, broadband services simply would not work. The telecommunications system that enables our networked society is global, and solutions to issues such as cybersecurity must be global too. We must meet the challenge posed by the massive growth in data traffic that is not yet matched by infrastructure development. And many believe there should be a level playing field at national and international levels, to avoid abuse of power by dominant players. WCIT is where such questions can start to be openly discussed and answered. It is a world conference and a unique meeting place where issues can be debated that will have an immense impact on our lives. What is at stake is whether we advance together towards a truly connected world, or instead contemplate a deepening digital divide with all its consequences. We cannot afford to miss the opportunities presented by WCIT. Through dialogue, compromise and cooperation, the conference can help lead us towards a knowledge society in which people everywhere, whatever their circumstances, can access, use, share and create data in an affordable and secure manner. That is what WCIT is about.","The World Conference on International Telecommunications is currently taking place in Dubai .

"(CNN) -- If you don't spend much time online, and if you're older than most college students, you may have missed the thousands of teens and 20-somethings who were running around the country this week with red ""X"" marks on their hands. No, they didn't go clubbing last night. They're trying to end slavery. It's OK if those things seem wildly unconnected at first. The gap between drawing a mark on your hand and preventing a woman in Nepal, Mozambique or New Jersey from being sold into the sex trafficking business, or liberating one of the estimated 20 to 30 million people who are enslaved today, is admittedly a large one. And, because of that, the END IT movement, which organized the recent online-plus-real-world campaign, has gotten some heat from some laptop cynics who say their efforts aren't making a real, tangible difference in the big-sad-real world. ""It's almost offensive how stupid this #endit movement is,"" one person wrote on Twitter. ""These red x's in people's hands aren't freeing any slaves. All these pictures are just annoying me. #enough #endit,"" said another. But I say forget all that. Slapping a red ""X"" on your hand and uploading a photo of it to Instagram or Twitter with the hashtag #enditmovement (as tens of thousands have done) can help end slavery. It's not going to happen right away, of course. But it's the first step. ""Nothing happens just because we are aware of modern-day slavery,"" the group says on its website, ""but nothing will EVER happen until we are."" Amen, brothers and sisters. The debate over the merits of these sorts of online awareness raising campaigns, sometimes referred to as ""slacktivism"" or ""clicktivism,"" is getting tired. It seems to have started in 2009, when Twitter users made their avatars green in support of anti-regime protests in Iran. That social media campaign succeeded, but the protests, of course, failed. Shortly after, The New Yorker's Malcolm Gladwell proclaimed that ""the revolution would not be tweeted"" because the Internet's ""weak ties seldom lead to high-risk activism,"" which is needed in order to spur real change. Those ideas resurfaced last month when the U.S. Supreme Court was hearing two same-sex marriage cases. The Human Rights Campaign, an advocacy group, asked Facebook and Twitter users to change their public profile images to a red equals sign, in support of marriage equality. Millions of people made the switch. But some writers, including Brian Moylan from VICE, argued that this one-click symbolic action was ""completely useless."" ""Yes, the show of support is heartwarming. It's nice to see so many people who want their gay friends to be spoiled brides just like all their straight friends, but you're not doing anything,"" he wrote on Vice.com. ""This is just another form of passive activism that isn't advancing the cause. Do you know what would be helpful? Actually picking up a sign, heading down to the Supreme Court and joining the throngs of protesters. Do you know what would be useful? Instead of just downloading an image and clicking a few buttons, going to the website of a gay rights organization (or any gay organization for that matter) and giving them some money so they can fight for gay civil rights on your behalf."" He also suggested that the slacktivists write letters to representatives. Both writers make good points, but their arguments shouldn't be used to condemn efforts to raise awareness about pressing social issues. And they discount the real good that these social media efforts can and do have. The evidence is incomplete, but I'd bet that ""completely useless"" Human Rights Campaign equals-sign demonstration led people to do exactly all the things that Moylan suggests would be more valuable than clicking a button on Facebook. ""I don't have hard data, but we definitely saw an increase in donations through our website,"" said Michael Cole-Schwartz, spokesman for Human Rights Campaign. ""In fact, our site crashed on Wednesday (March 27) from all of the traffic. I think that, anecdotally, there is reason to suggest it has helped from a fundraising perspective, and I think there's a larger social good from the visibility."" On the ""larger good"" point, Cole-Schwartz mentioned a message Human Rights Campaign received from a man who said his mom's first show of support for him as an openly gay person was to change her Facebook profile image to the red equals sign. U.S. Sen. Jon Tester, from Montana, announced his public support for marriage equality by making the change on Facebook. And, Cole-Schwartz said, there is the likely possibility that closeted gay kids were comforted when they saw the flood of digital support for gay rights. Similarly, real-world action has accompanied the END IT movement's red ""X"" campaign. The group, which funded its activities with donations it collected from college kids at the Christian-themed Passion conference in January, has raised more than $200,000 for several anti-slavery organizations. All of that money went to noble nonprofits, not to the END IT movement itself, said Bryson Vogeltanz, the group's ""chief steward."" Students at about 2,000 U.S. colleges and universities have ""done something"" in response to the campaign, which began in February and culminated on Tuesday with the red ""X"" project online, Vogeltanz told me. The Polaris Project, the group that runs an anti-trafficking hot line, says its call volume was up 65% in January, to 2,850 calls, in part because that's when the END IT movement launched at the Christian youth conference. Megan Fowler, a spokesman for the Polaris Project, said calls were up this week, too, although it's harder to tease out the source, because the group on Tuesday announced a partnership with Google to create the Global Human Trafficking Hotline Network. And, most tellingly, a young woman in Texas, Vogeltanz told me, was rescued from sex trafficking because someone who had heard about the END IT movement questioned whether she was in trouble. Her family thought she had run away from home, he said. None of that sounds like slacking to me. If you want to help end modern slavery, I'd encourage you to visit the ""action"" section of the END IT movement's website and also CNN's Freedom Project blog. We have a list of reputable nonprofit groups, both internationally and listed by country. There also is a list of anti-trafficking hot lines around the world; a guide to help parents and educators figure out how to talk to kids about slavery; and a list of signs that a person may be the victim of human trafficking. The Polaris Project also recently created a texting feature, in part to help people who are victims of sex trafficking or slavery. People who are in trouble, or who suspect they have witnessed trafficking, can text ""help"" to ""BEFREE"" (233733). If you have other ideas, please share them in the comments below.

"(CNN) -- Chilean inspectors stumbled upon hundreds of exotic animals from Peru destined for illegal trade while conducting what they thought was going to be a routine inspection of a fishing boat, the government said Tuesday. A family of Scarlet macaws in Costa Rica in June 2008 at a zoo aimed at conserving the species. The Chilean boat, the Rosa Isabel, was carrying macaws, toucans, parrots, turtles, squirrels and crocodiles, most of them protected by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, which prohibits the sale of these species, the government said in a statement. In all, officials counted more than 400 exotic animals from Peru, the statement said. The incident began before dawn, when inspectors from Chile's Maritime Administration boarded the boat and found the live cargo stuffed inside dozens of cardboard boxes lined with chicken wire and with holes cut on the sides for ventilation. The animals were handed over to the Farm and Cattle Service of Arica, Chile's northernmost city, for return to Peru, the minister of agriculture said Monday in a statement. The captain of the ship, Moises Segundo Diaz Verdugo, a Chilean national, faces a possible fine of between $188,000 and $940,000, to be determined by an Agriculture and Livestock Service (SAG) court. Under an agreement between SAG and the National Institute of Natural Resources of the Republic of Peru, signed in 2007, the animals will be returned to Peru, SAG said. The national director of SAG, Francisco Bahamonde, credited coordination among various state bodies with impeding the illegal entry of protected species and products that can transmit pests or illnesses and said they would ""redouble"" their efforts.

"(CNN) -- With the advent of ""cyberwar,"" a poorly defined term that seems to be used as a catch-all phrase for all manners of computer-related attacks, it's natural to ask about cyber arms control. Richard Clarke, former cybersecurity adviser to President Obama, has advocated along with others for cyber arms control or new legal rules for war in cyberspace. If governments have the ability to build the tools of cyberwarfare, then presumably, they can regulate and control them. But realistically, it's unlikely that cyber arms control will happen anytime soon. When we think of arms control, we consider the efforts of the Cold War, which dramatically cut the number of nuclear weapons and other strategic armaments, from the period of detente to the eventual collapse of the Soviet Union. Arms control works fairly well for managing the arsenals of weapons that are large and complex. However, cyberweapons are of a different league. All you need is training in computer software engineering and some talent. On the Internet, there is readily available literature on coding and hacking, and of course, a plethora of open source tools. Just as easy as it is to be an effective cyberdefender, you can learn to be an effective offensive cyber-operator. Cyber attacks can be crafted and used by individuals or groups. Importantly, they can make impact even without significant involvement from a nation. For example, the Anonymous hacker group is able to disrupt major corporations and even countries with its campaigns for transparency. Furthermore, when Anonymous is unable to disrupt a target, it typically resorts to overtaking websites with massive denial of service attacks. Despite the role of nonstate players, it is the brinkmanship between countries in cyberspace that make the big headlines. Mandiant, a cybersecurity company, reported a series of cyber attacks on U.S. companies that was traced to China's People's Liberation Army unit 61398 based in Shanghai. One of the lessons in the analysis is how remarkably effective the Chinese attackers were despite a stunning lack of sophistication and sloppiness in their tradecraft. In contrast, our biggest and most innovative corporations have developed and deployed sophisticated defense systems that still seem to be regularly breached, despite the efforts of their comically inept adversaries. If the Chinese PLA ever gets its act together, we're in real trouble. How might this get worse? We already know that cyber-espionage can harm companies. The risks of cybersabotage can be worse. For example, industrial control systems are largely computer controlled and they can be reached in some cases from the Internet. Future terrorist organizations could cause spectacular physical and economic damage to our refineries, power plants, water systems, pipelines and other important systems without leaving a marked trail or suffering significant personal risk. In the wake of the Stuxnet attacks on Iran's uranium-refinement centrifuges or the Shamoon attack on Saudi Aramco's computers, cybersabotage can no longer be considered theoretical. It is happening now. It's not difficult to imagine a future in which cyber attacks become more frequent or serious. In such a world, there will be a need for diplomacy and norm-setting among the international community. But if we ever wanted to consider treaties on cyber disarmament, or regulations on the use of hacking tools by those wishing to do more than simply spy or steal, we would become immediately stymied by how to enforce the rules. Barring a radical change in the technological playing field, there will never be an effective cyber equivalent of the International Atomic Energy Agency despite all the aspirations of organizations like the International Telecommunications Union to serve such a function. The very idea that an international organization could enforce rules on the misuse of computers is ludicrous. The problem of cyber arms control is akin to the greatest arms control failure of the Cold War, which still persists: the mass distribution of the most produced firearm in human history, the Kalashnikov AK-47. According to the World Bank, as many as 100 million of these brutally simple weapons are scattered across the globe (roughly one for every 70 people on the planet, and that excludes the millions of Western military rifles out there, too). From every major trouble spot, we see footage of Kalashnikov-wielding soldiers, terrorists and rebels. Global attempts to sweep up such weapons, as well as their bigger and more volatile relatives -- rocket-propelled grenades -- have been mostly ineffective. The U.N. has worked for more than a decade on an Arms Trade Treaty designed to limit the illicit trade of such weapons, but a final draft of the treaty is stalled. For better or for worse, the Internet has become one more field upon which the game of nations is played. Just as the Internet can be used for sharing information and enabling commerce, it can also be used to steal secrets and to cause damage. In the short term, we might see private industry adopt defensive practices. In the long term, while we may never be able to eliminate electronic espionage, we may be able to reduce its reach through vigilance and diplomacy. As for cyber arms control, forget about it. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Christopher Bronk and Dan Wallach.","Christopher Bronk, Dan Wallach: Cyber arms control is unlikely to happen soon .
Bronk, Wallach: Cyberattacks can be crafted and launched by individuals, groups .

"(CNN) -- ""I don't consider criminal background checks to be gun control."" Republican U.S. Sen. Pat Toomey made this profound statement earlier this week while announcing a bipartisan Senate agreement to expand background checks to almost all gun purchasers. Toomey is absolutely correct. Background checks are not about gun control, they're about human safety. Having checks will make it more difficult for criminals and the insane to obtain guns. Yet, despite polls showing that over 90% of Americans support universal background checks, it took a ""breakthrough"" deal to get this proposal simply to a vote by the U.S. Senate. What's worse, there's no guarantee this legislation will pass the Republican-controlled House. Congress' exasperating struggle to enact a law supported by most Americans is topic No. 1 of this week's episode of the CNN podcast, ""The Big Three,"" co-hosted by CNN Opinion contributors Margaret Hoover, John Avlon and myself. Each week we look at three big issues from the week. The second big issue is the death of Great Britain's former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. Is the fawning over her justified or did her failings outweigh her accomplishments? And third, is the new song by country singer Brad Paisley and rapper LL Cool J, titled, ""The Accidental Racist,"" racially insensitive, or in today's hypersensitive climate is it simply impossible to discuss race without causing an outcry? To listen to this episode of ""The Big Three,"" click on the Soundcloud audio player on this page. Or you can find us on iTunes. Here's a brief summary of this week's episode: . 1. Gun safety laws . John Avlon discussed the cowardice of the Republican senators who threatened a filibuster to prevent a vote on the proposed universal background check law, a point he also raised in his most recent column. Margaret Hoover -- a reasonable voice on the right (almost an oxymoron) -- agreed that Republican senators like Ted Cruz could cause the entire GOP to appear as extremists if they prevented a vote on this proposal via filibuster. I made the case that we need to stop calling these measures ""gun control"" laws and instead label them as ""human safety"" laws because the focus is on saving lives, not grabbing guns. I also raised the point: Is the second amendment out of date? It was enacted when we had 13 states, a population of 4 million and muskets. Should we consider revising or repealing the second amendment to bring it up to date with today's world so that owning guns is a privilege rather than a right? 2. Death of Margaret Thatcher . Margaret Hoover, a big Thatcher fan, shared the thrill of meeting the former prime minister years ago. I refused to speak ill of the recently deceased Thatcher. So instead, I read excerpts from a recent op-ed penned by British comedian Russell Brand (we all know comedians tend to write the best opinion pieces). Brand was highly critical of Thatcher's reign. John and Margaret both defended Thatcher from Brand's allegations that she was an uncaring person who favored the wealthy at the expense of the working class. 3. 'The Accidental Racist' Paisley and LL Cool J recorded a song in the hopes of easing racial tension and fostering more understanding. Instead, their song was met by almost universal criticism. Some said the lyrics are culturally insensitive, others said it's just bad. All three of us agreed that some of the lyrics were ridiculous, such as LL Cool J's line: ""If you don't judge my gold chains/I'll forget the iron chains."" Was LL really saying that if a White man doesn't judge his choice of flashy jewelry, then Black Americans should forget slavery? But the bigger point we discussed is that it's almost impossible to talk about race in America without being attacked by people on both the far left and far right. I also tell a joke about ""White people"" that I had performed last month on a TV show that generated an avalanche of angry tweets and e-mails. Just shows, we've gone a long way to go. We hope you will give a listen to this episode of ""The Big Three"" -- and let us know what you think about the issues we discussed.

"New York (CNN) -- ""Guy who eats weird food"" is probably how most people think of Andrew Zimmern. It's a title he's earned after years of choking down (and frequently appearing to enjoy) such strange edibles as iguana, live octopus, rotten shark and (urgh) cow placenta on his Travel Channel show ""Bizarre Foods."" But there's more to Zimmern than a fearless digestive system. He's also a celebrated chef. Not that surprising? OK, how about this: He was a homeless alcoholic and drug addict for almost a year. Zimmern was lucky. Friends and family arranged an intervention and entered him into an inpatient rehabilitation facility in Minnesota. Once sober, Zimmern worked his way back up the culinary ladder he had descended, culminating in a post as executive chef at Minneapolis' CafÃ© Un Deux Trois. That position ultimately led to his current TV hosting role. Years after his rehabilitation, Zimmern was approached by his former homeroom teacher, who wondered whether he would consider being involved in a nonprofit benefitting those whose story Zimmern knew all too well: Services for the Underserved. SUS specializes in helping individuals and families in New York facing homelessness, mental illness, disabilities, HIV and other barriers to employment. It takes a holistic approach, providing training, housing and support tailored to people's unique situations. Intrigued, Zimmern went to visit SUS's residential facilities and meet with participants. ""I immediately wanted to get involved,"" he said. ""The greatest gift I've been able to receive in life is another chance, and I want to make sure other people have that opportunity as well."" He felt that its multipronged approach to people's issues is what sets SUS apart from other organizations. ""It's not enough to give a homeless person a home,"" he explained. ""You have to treat them with dignity and respect; you have to train them to get back into the job service system; you have to address their mental health issues and physical health issues."" At the SUS Clubhouse in Brooklyn, a multitude of activities are taking place at any given time. Peer training is one, where many of those who have overcome challenges such as mental health issues and homelessness work with peers to mentor and prepare them to, in turn, help others who are struggling. Job skills training, veteran outreach and mental health services are available there. A kitchen provides culinary training and food for SUS beneficiaries. It's only one of many facilities and services offered in the city. SUS is reactive; if it sees that a person has a special skill, be it artistic, cooking, gardening, or a particular need such as addiction treatment or counseling, the organization will try to provide for that. It often simply fills gaps in basic needs that federal or city services have left in underserved populations, such as housing and food. ""The idea is to help people achieve self-actualization and empowerment,"" said Donna Colonna, founder and CEO of SUS. ""So that's where the money goes -- and some real bricks-and-mortar type things; we do a lot of housing. ... But we definitely need continued support."" Funds are spread around the various initiatives, but despite the fact that it has existed for several decades, SUS sometimes struggles with visibility and budgeting so many initiatives in a city as large as NYC. Boosting visibility and helping with fundraising is a large part of Zimmern's work with SUS. For one such initiative, he organized a ""dinner for a better New York,"" enlisting the help of 11 celebrity chefs such as Masaharu Morimoto, Nobu Matsuhisa and Marc Forgione to create a menu, and an evening, to raise money and awareness for SUS. Zimmern believes it's his personal history with addiction and homelessness that makes him a particularly helpful advocate for SUS. ""I can relate to the residents and the community that SUS serves in a very unique way,"" he explained. For Zimmern, his work with SUS is something of a karmic opportunity. ""If I have been given this success that the second chance has (given me),"" he says, ""to not extend the lifeline of helping, do what I can to help those in need, I think, would be really shameful."" To that end, he wants people to know that every little bit helps. ""Not everybody is so disposed to go out and volunteer or raise money or actually sit down and talk to another person by sitting at the end of their bed when they're in a residential situation and try to help them,"" he acknowledged. ""Those that do that, however, need our support."" Donate to SUS .","Zimmern was homeless for almost a year on the streets of NYC .

"(CNN) -- On a hot summer day in early August, 2008, the secure Red Switch phone in my office at CIA was lighting up with calls from National Security Adviser Steve Hadley. The Russian Army had invaded the Republic of Georgia in the Caucasus mountain region. Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili was frantic about his country's safety and desperate for information on Russian forces and Russia's intent. I promised Steve some answers, hung up the phone and walked to my outer office to direct my executive assistants to ""get our Georgia people up here right away."" As they busily dialed phones and typed e-mails, I remember turning to my chief of staff and only half jokingly asking him, ""We've got Georgia people, right?"" I recall that day now as a debate has begun about the focus of the American intelligence community and especially of the CIA. In discussing his new book, ""The Way of the Knife,"" New York Times national security correspondent Mark Mazzetti suggests that CIA's obsession with fighting terrorism might have blinded it to the inevitability, imminence and rapid spread of the Arab Awakening. In March, press reports said the President's Intelligence Advisory Board, a panel of senior outside advisers, had come to much the same conclusion, accusing the intelligence community of too much focus on military operations and drone strikes at the expense of other targets such as China and the Middle East. Back in August 2008, we did indeed have ""Georgia people,"" and they were quite good. Within a few days, the entire team was gathered around a conference table at CIA headquarters giving President George W. Bush their personal appreciation of the situation. But precise tactical intelligence was hard to come by (questions such as where exactly was the front line of Russian troops). Recent technical collection systems had been developed and deployed for the counterterrorism target, not for tracking the successor to the Red Army. And the fact that I had asked my half-joking question should suggest that neither the topic of Georgia nor the ""Georgia people"" were frequent visitors to my office. More broadly, when asked what were the priorities of the agency during my time there, I would respond with a bit of Washington-insider alphabet soup, ""CT, CP, ROW."" Translation: counterterrorism, counterproliferation (mostly Iran), the rest of the world. The American intelligence community works hard against a variety of tough targets every day, but questions about current balance and emphasis are as understandable as they are inevitable. The demands of more than a decade of constant war have clearly had their impact. Much of what passes for analysis today is really targeting: targeting an individual for direct action, targeting an individual for increased collection, targeting an individual to make sure he doesn't board an aircraft en route to the United States. The National Security Agency has always had two sides to its personality: a national enterprise that meets the needs of policymakers across the U.S. government and one that serves as a combat support agency for the Department of Defense of which it remains a part. Even with a substantially increased budget, after more than a decade of combat, it should be clear that the battlefield support side of the agency's personality has become increasingly dominant. Since 2001, CIA case officers have routinely been sent to war zones as their first operational assignment. They have performed magnificently. But the skills they have honed there are often different from the skills required for classical espionage and many are frankly bored when they return to more routine work where Kevlar and a personal weapon are not required equipment. America's singular focus on counterterrorism has also affected intelligence cooperation with allies. Many simply do not agree with our legal position that this is a war and others object to tactics such as targeted killings and extraordinary renditions. Although most appreciate that American actions have made them safer, the potential uses to which we could put their information strains intimacy and limits sharing. We occasionally have to pull our own punches. To what degree, for example, did we limit contacts (intelligence or otherwise) with the Muslim Brotherhood in Hosni Mubarak's Egypt so as not to risk the solid counterterrorism partnership with the regime? Some are now calling these actions a distortion of American intelligence, but none of these steps was inappropriate for the circumstances in which we found ourselves after 9/11. Indeed, I initiated some of them and supported all of them while in government. Many of them need to continue. Al Qaeda's threat is diminished, not eliminated. Richard Haass, former State Department official and head of the Council on Foreign Relations, may have put it best when he suggested that what we need here is a dial, not a switch. And this is more than just an intelligence question. Collection and analysis usually chase after the things that policymakers hold most dear. If their view is immediate and tactical, much of their intelligence will follow. My ""Georgia people"" were great. I should have paid more attention to them before August 2008. Priorities being what they were, I didn't. I was reflecting on this when, a few weeks before his confirmation hearing, I had breakfast with Dave Petraeus. As we were leaving the table, I suggested that the CIA had never looked more like its wartime predecessor, OSS, than it did right then. That had made America safer, but I reminded the eneral that the CIA was not the OSS. It was the nation's leading espionage and analytic service and that -- much as I did -- he would have to struggle to remember that every day. All this means that tough choices lie ahead, all of them fraught with risk, as the community deals with current dangers while also embracing broader and more enduring tasks. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Michael Hayden.","Ex-CIA chief says some are urging CIA to get out of targeting terrorists .

"Tokyo (CNN) -- Japanese authorities arrested the last fugitive suspected in a deadly 1995 nerve gas attack on the Tokyo subway, police said Friday. He was caught in front of a comic book cafe in Tokyo after its staff alerted police of the presence of a man resembling the suspect. A fingerprint test positively identified the man as Katsuya Takahashi, 54, the only suspect in the gas attack case who remained at large, a spokesman for the Tokyo Metropolitan Police said. Takahashi is being held on suspicion of murder and attempted murder in relation to the attack, according to the spokesman. During the morning rush-hour in March 1995, members of the Aum Supreme Truth cult released sarin gas that led to the deaths of 13 people and sickened more than 5,500 commuters. Thousands of police have been on the lookout for the suspect. Last week, police apprehended another member of the doomsday cult. More than 200 members of the cult were convicted after the gas attack. Thirteen, including Shoko Asahara, the cult's blind guru, were sentenced to death. However, no one has been executed. The cult claims to be a benign religious group, but at the height of its activities in the 1990s, it preached the world was coming to an end and it must arm itself to prepare for various calamities.","Police use fingerprints to positively identify the suspect .

"(CNN) -- Portugal's Rui Costa rode to glory in Gap Tuesday as Tour de France leader Chris Froome was left fuming by a late high speed tangle with arch rival Alberto Contador. Movistar rider Costa was part of a 26-strong breakaway group, who were allowed free reign on the 16th stage as Froome and the rest of the yellow jersey contenders waged their own private battle. Costa, who was winning his second Tour stage, crossed the line after 168km from Vaison-la-Romaine to Gap in three hours 52 minutes 45 seconds. He made a timely attack on the final second category climb of a testing day's racing to finish 42 seconds clear of second placed Christophe Riblon of France. Britain's Froome came under repeated attack on the final ascent from Contador of Spain, but with help from Sky teammate Richie Porte, each was repulsed. The final tricky descent into Gap saw Saxo Tinkoff's Contador make further attempts to claw back vital time on the race leader, but on a sharp corner, just over eight kilometers from the finish, he hit the tarmac. Froome was also impeded and had to briefly take one foot out of his pedals, but was unscathed. Porte then guided the pair back to the elite group, which also contained second-placed Bauke Mollema, Czech Roman Kreuziger and Nairo Quintana of Colombia. Contador appeared to be examining injuries to his elbow, but rode freely to the finish. He remained in third place overall, 11 seconds behind Mollema, but four minutes 25 seconds in arrears of the all-conquering Froome, who was clearly unimpressed by Contador's approach. ""It was bit careless of Contador,"" he told ITV Sport. ""He overcooked one of the corners and came off in front of me. ""I just think at this stage of the race he is obviously getting desperate, attacking on the descents,"" he added. The big loser on the day was Mollema's Belkin teammate Laurens Ten Dam, who was distanced by the late attacks and dropped out of the top five. Dutchman Mollema was praised though for his sportmanship in refraining from making a further attack after Contador and Froome were held up by their incident. Wednesday's 17th stage will give another clue as to the eventual winner of the centenary edition of the Tour -- a 32km mountain time trial from Embrun to Chorges in the Alps. Froome, who extended his lead by winning Sunday's stage to Mont Ventoux, will be favored to take the honors as he bids to improve his second place on the 2012 Tour.","Portugal's Rui Costa wins 16th stage of Tour de France .

"(CNN) -- The United States avenged its defeat in last year's FIFA Women's World Cup final by beating Japan 2-1 to defend its Olympic title at London's Wembley Stadium on Thursday. In front of 80,203 fans, a record for a women's soccer match at the Games, the U.S. won a fourth Olympic gold in five tournaments thanks to a goal in each half from midfielder Carli Lloyd. Japan beat Pia Sundhage's team in a dramatic penalty shootout at last year's World Cup in Germany, but the Asian team could only offer Yuki Ogimi's second-half goal in response. The U.S. got off to a perfect start when Lloyd met striker Alex Morgan's cross with a brave header after eight minutes. The Japanese, guaranteed a historic first women's football medal after beating France in the semifinals, were angered when a penalty wasn't given for a Tobin Heath handball midway through the first half. Live blog: Olympic final as it happened . After Japan hit the crossbar twice before halftime, Lloyd doubled her tally and the Americans' lead with a stunning solo strike in the 55th minute. The 30-year-old curled a 20-yard shot into the net following a run which began inside her own half. Striker Ogimi offered Japan a lifeline when she bundled a shot into the net after U.S. captain Christie Rampone had failed to clear her lines. Rampone was at fault again when she gifted possession to substitute Mana Iwabuchi, who saw her shot athletically saved by Hope Solo. Japan pushed to find an equalizer but the U.S. held on. It could have been 3-1, but striker Abby Wambach -- who finished the tournament with five goals -- headed over from a late corner. Canada, beaten 4-3 by the U.S. in a dramatic semifinal, clinched the bronze medal earlier on Thursday by beating France 1-0 in Coventry. France dominated large parts of the match, but Canada secured a first medal in this event when midfielder Diana Matheson capitalized on some loose defending to win the match in injury time.","Team USA beats Japan 2-1 to win Olympic women's football gold .

"(CNN) -- Dividing up the newspapers on a recent weekend, my husband asked me if I wanted to see the Sports section. ""No,"" I replied jokingly. ""Reading the sports got me into a big argument once."" Big argument indeed. This week's Masters Golf Tournament marks the 10th and final round of the national brouhaha over admitting women to the Augusta National Golf Club. Female members will be present for the first time. As leader of the National Council of Women's Organizations, I was the standard-bearer for the ""girls team"" in the controversy over a woman's place -- not only at Augusta National but in society as a whole -- that raged in the media and around kitchen tables alike for more than a year beginning in 2002. The dispute has continued to simmer, mostly out of the public eye, for the past decade. Although not as loud as it was in 2003 when the council's petition to then-chairman Hootie Johnson to open the club culminated in a public protest, the argument never went away. Confined by a sheriff's directive to a muddy field far from Augusta's entrance -- with promises of arrest if we moved -- and surrounded by more police than supporters, the protest was roundly ridiculed at the time as a failure. It's true that women did not walk through the gates as equal members that day. But the national dialogue during the preceding year, combined with legal action facilitated by the National Council of Women's Organizations in the following years, triggered change that took a decade to mature. By the long-view standard, our action was most definitely not a failure. There is little doubt that if we had not raised the issue and kept it alive for a decade, women would still be barred from one of the highest profile ""off-campus"" business venues in the United States, if not the world. Last summer the gates finally opened a crack and two women -- Darla Moore and Condoleezza Rice -- were allowed to slip through. During the 2012 Masters Tournament a few months earlier, the club and its major sponsor, IBM, had drawn their own share of public ridicule when Augusta National refused to grant membership to IBM's new CEO Virginia Rometty, though they had always invited her male predecessors. IBM had meekly acquiesced to the insult, bringing Rometty to the tournament to ""entertain clients"" and parading her around the grounds in a pink jacket. Last year's IBM debacle was a public relations nightmare, but it was not the major reason the club opened to women. After all, the original controversy was also a public relations nightmare -- for both Augusta National and its sponsors -- and one that had stayed front and center in the media for a full year. Nor was current chairman Billy Payne responsible for the change, as some speculated. He had already been at the helm for six years, and it seems obvious he might not have been chosen without agreeing to continue the club's no-women policy. (The council and our attorneys asked Payne for a private meeting shortly after his election. He never responded.) In the aftermath of the original controversy, the National Council of Women's Organizations, in partnership with a major civil rights law firm in Washington, helped bring lawsuits for sex discrimination in employment against major corporations whose CEOs were members of the club. We had been hearing from women who worked at these companies since we made the membership list public in 2002. It looked like a roster of the Fortune 500. It seems that sex discrimination does not stop at CEO club memberships, but trickles down to front-line management. Two of our lawsuits -- against Morgan Stanley and the Smith-Barney division of Citigroup -- netted nearly $80 million in settlements to the women. The price of membership in Augusta had just gone up. More important, the suits resulted in agreements by the companies not to honor business expenses that are directly or indirectly related to male-only entertainment establishments. In effect, they can no longer entertain or hold events at venues that discriminate. Our project is ongoing, and there are many more companies still represented on the Augusta roster. Were sex discrimination lawsuits the bulldozer that finally knocked down Augusta National's tree house? Perhaps not, though surely they contributed. In the 10 years since that original protest, the council and our allies also continued to challenge exclusion of women not only at Augusta National Golf Club, but also everywhere women are left out when important business contacts and deals are made. We changed the argument from one about the ""rights"" of so-called private clubs to one about the ""wrongs"" of a cadre of industry titans using the fig leaf of such memberships to exclude women, the standard this behavior sets in corporate America and damage it does to women at all levels. Public opinion followed, until by 2012 the position of the club and its members was not only indefensible, it was seen as antiquated and ridiculous. Unfortunately, one action can't change ingrained corporate practices overnight. Women in the Fortune 500 have made some progress in the last 10 years as top earners, from 5% to 8%; but men still hold 96% of the CEO spots, from 98% a decade ago; and 86.5% of Fortune 1000 board seats, down from 90%. On the lower rungs, adult women are still the majority of minimum wage earners and the majority of clerical support workers, and the pay gap between women and men working full time and year-round is just under 20%. Sex discrimination at work, not only in the executive suites but also up and down the line, is still rampant. So, was a decade of struggle to open one golf club to women worth the effort? Was it worth the credible death threats, volumes of vile and vulgar hate mail, and my image on stickers at the bottom of urinals? For all it represented symbolically, the answer is an unequivocal ""yes."" Backward beliefs about women's place in society can and must change, and that fight was one part of making it happen. Arguments like the one over Augusta National matter, because they shine a bright light on the ingrained attitudes that should be no longer acceptable in a civilized society. Without countless such confrontations -- large and small -- over ""a woman's place"" throughout our history, the ranks of women in executive suites, the U.S. Congress, courtrooms, surgical theaters, the military, and many other places in society would still be close to zero, and the idea of a female president would be as alien as a creature from Mars. Let's hope the club does not make tokens out of its female members, as it appears to have done with its very few men of color. If more women follow Moore and Rice through those vaunted gates and are treated as truly equal with the men -- or more companies refuse to be associated with Augusta National if women aren't treated equally -- it will be the more lasting victory. The big argument over female members at Augusta National was never about golf. It was about discrimination at the highest levels of American corporate power and the message that sends about where women belong in business and society. Until we're truly equal, we must all continue to fight to change the culture that let it happen in the first place. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Martha Burk.","Martha Burk: A decade of protests opened Augusta National Golf Club to women .
The fight wasn't about golf, she says, it was about women's ""place"" in the corridors of power .

"(CNN) -- Iran is taking on one of the world's biggest Internet giants, threatening to sue over something that is not on its maps. On state-run Press TV, the Iranian regime warns it may take legal action against Google for not labeling the Persian Gulf. It's the latest volley in what one expert calls a ""war of words"" that has raged for decades over the waterway that borders Iran and several Arab countries. Iran previously lashed out against the U.S. military for calling the waterway the Arabian Gulf. In a statement Thursday, the Iranian regime accused Google of carrying out efforts of Iran's enemies. ""Toying with modern technologies in political issues is among the new measures by the enemies against Iran, (and) in this regard, Google has been treated as a plaything,"" Foreign Ministry spokesman Ramin Mehmanparast said Thursday, according to state-run Press TV. He added that ""omitting the name Persian Gulf is (like) playing with the feelings and realities of the Iranian nation."" On state-run news agency IRNA, Iranian officials accused Google of having removed the words ""Persian Gulf."" But a Google spokesperson told CNN the body of water was never labeled. ""It's just simply the case that we don't have a label for every body of water,"" the spokesperson said, speaking anonymously on the issue in keeping with company policy. The spokesperson would not name any other specific areas that are not labeled. If you type ""Persian Gulf"" into Google Maps, the resulting map shows you the Persian Gulf but does not label it. Nearby bodies of water -- including the Gulf of Oman, Arabian Sea, Gulf of Aden and Red Sea -- are labeled. Google uses the marker ""A"" to show you whichever location you requested. The column to the left of the map does say that the A is in the ""Persian Gulf."" Anger over the lack of a label on the map has spread not just within Iran's government, but among the population and Iranians living around the world. At least nine pages on Facebook are dedicated to the issue, including ""Hey Google, put Persian Gulf back on the map"" and ""Boycott Google for removing Persian Gulf from the maps."" There have also been times that Arabs complained the waterway should be called the Arabian Gulf, says Clive Holes, a professor at the University of Oxford who specializes in language and the contemporary Arab world. ""It's a war of words,"" he says. ""These are symbolic things"" and involve ""a lot of emotion,"" Holes said. The National Iranian American Council has complained that the term ""Arabian Gulf"" began ""as Pan-Arabism propaganda and was later used by Saddam Hussein to exploit ethnic rivalries in support of his regional ambitions."" In 2010, the U.S. Navy was bombarded with thousands of angry, pro-Iranian messages on its Facebook page. The Navy responded with its own extensive statement on Facebook. ""We are aware of the long and proud history of the Persian people,"" the Navy said at the time. It added that ""Arabian Gulf"" is used for its forces, but that in other respects, including nautical charts and publications, ""the historic name of Persian Gulf is used."" Iran has gone after other groups before for either using the term ""Arabian Gulf' or simply calling it ""the gulf."" The country banned the British publication The Economist once in 2006 for calling the waterway ""the Gulf,"" and it launched protests against the Louvre museum in Paris when its guides did the same, the British newspaper The Guardian reported. Google would not say whether it has had direct contact with Iranian authorities on the issue, nor whether it has received many complaints. Holes says Google is ""boxing clever"" -- making a smart move -- by not labeling something controversial. ""They don't want to annoy anybody."" Google Maps has found itself in controversial terrain before. In November 2010, a Nicaraguan general cited Google's map of the border with Costa Rica to justify a reported raid in a disputed area. The dispute over the term ""Persian Gulf"" is a reminder that what a place is called can have powerful political repercussions. While much of the world refers to the Asian nation west of Thailand as Myanmar, the U.S. government still calls it Burma. The State Department explains that the ruling junta changed the name to Myanmar in 1989, but some in the democratic opposition don't recognize the change. ""Out of support for the democratic opposition, and its victory in the 1990 election, the U.S. government likewise uses 'Burma,'"" the State Department website says.

"Washington (CNN) -- Nearly a dozen Republicans who might be considering a run for the GOP presidential nomination in 2016 are auditioning in front of the Conservative Political Action Conference, which touts itself as the largest and oldest annual gathering of conservatives. On Friday, Mitt Romney, the 2012 Republican presidential nominee, will speak at CPAC. If Romney is the GOP's past, then Senators Marco Rubio of Florida and Rand Paul of Kentucky are the GOP's future. Both men, considered leading 2016 Republican White House hopefuls, gave back-to-back and dueling speeches Thursday. Although different in style and with divergent plans to revitalize a party that's lost the last two presidential elections, both men praised the conservative cause. ""We don't need a new idea. There is an idea. The idea is called America, and it still works,"" Rubio said to loud applause. Paul said that for the Republican Party to win, ""liberty needs to be the backbone of the GOP."" Texas Gov. Rick Perry spoke a few hours later. His 2012 bid for the GOP nomination crashed and burned, but he is considering another run in 2016. Perry used his address to criticize Romney and Arizona Sen. John McCain, the 2008 Republican nominee. ""The popular media narrative is that this country has shifted away from conservative ideals, as evidenced by the last two presidential elections. That's what they say,"" Perry said. ""That might be true if Republicans had actually nominated conservative candidates in 2008 and 2012."" On Friday, former Sen. Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania, a conservative favorite who battled Romney deep into last year's Republican primary calendar, is scheduled to make several appearances. Santorum could make another run for the White House in 2016. Big CPAC surprise: Jeb Bush not on ballot . Later in the afternoon Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, who is also considered a possible presidential hopeful, will address the crowd. So will House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan, the congressman from Wisconsin who was Romney's running mate. And Friday night former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, who lately has openly discussed 2016, will keynote a CPAC dinner. Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas and former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin will appear on Saturday. Cruz was born in Canada to an American mother and Cuban father; his eligibility for president has been subject to debate. Republican strategist and CNN contributor Alex Castellanos said there's a reason White House hopefuls come to the conference. ""CPAC is where all 2016 candidates need to go to pass the conservative litmus test: Are they for freedom, or for something less,"" said Castellanos, who is spearheading a new super-PAC called the NewRepublican.org to refocus the party's messaging and policy goals. Paul, Rubio provide competing glimpses of a revamped GOP . GOP strategist and CNN contributor Ana Navarro said CPAC is a must-do for anyone remotely thinking about the nomination. ""There's not many other events where they all accept the invitation and are happy to parade one after the other, modeling in their swimsuits and evening gowns hoping to be amongst the finalists,"" she said. The conference, which draws tons of attention, has been increasingly critiqued as more political carnival than conference. Regardless, the confab will once again end with its GOP presidential nomination straw poll, which is considered by many as a key gauge of conservative sentiment and garners much media coverage. But there's also been plenty of criticism in recent years that the CPAC straw poll is not the indicator it once was. ""It's a more an anecdotal measurement than an empirical one. Its relevance as a prediction of grassroots strength within the party has waned over the last few years. It can, however, give someone who isn't well known a shot of adrenaline so that they're more prominently featured in any of the chatter about 2016,"" said Kevin Madden, a GOP strategist who served as a senior adviser to Romney in both his 2012 and 2008 presidential campaigns. ""Folks shouldn't read too much into the results. Straw polls are kind of like political junk food. You know it's all empty calories, but some folks eat it anyway."" CPAC straw poll list shows wide array of 2016 potential . GOP analyst Rich Galen says the poll means nothing three years out from the election and it represents only part of the party. ""If we've learned anything from CPAC it's that the conference does not represent mainstream GOP thinking. The poll is routinely hijacked by whomever wants to spend the money to get the eight hours of attention,"" said Galen, who advised actor and former Tennessee Sen. Fred Thompson during his 2008 GOP presidential bid and is author of Mullings.com, an online column. ""Last year we not only did a straw poll but also had a national poll we announced simultaneously,"" said Al Cardenas, chairman of the American Conservative Union, the organization that puts on the conference. ""The outcomes were identical. The same order of top three finishers in the straw poll were the same order as the top three finishers in the national poll, and so to those skeptics who were concerned about the accuracy of the straw poll, the national poll provided empirical evidence that it was a pretty good representative sample of what's going on."" Romney finished first in both polls, ahead of Santorum and former House Speaker Newt Gingrich. This time around there are 23 names on the straw poll ballot, including some who were not invited to CPAC. Among those on the ballot who won't be speaking is Chris Christie, the tough-talking New Jersey governor who is considered a leading prospect for the 2016 nomination. While popular in his party, Christie angered some on the right after praising President Barack Obama for the federal response to Superstorm Sandy, which devastated parts of the Garden State just days before the November election. Christie also criticized House Republicans for temporarily holding up federal aid following the storm. Major conservative conference comes at crucial time for GOP . Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell also may have designs on the White House, but he is not addressing CPAC. Earlier this year he pushed through a transportation plan that included tax increases, considered heresy among fiscal conservatives. Though he doesn't have a keynote speaking role, he is part of a panel session at the conference. Others on the ballot without speaking spots include New Mexico Gov. Susana Martinez; former Indiana Gov. Mitch Daniels, who now heads Purdue University; and Ohio Sen. Rob Portman, a major Romney surrogate last year. Neurosurgeon Ben Carson interestingly appears on the poll -- the only one on the list who's never been elected to public office. He generated buzz in conservative circles after he advocated conservative policies on taxes and health care in front of President Obama while keynoting the national prayer breakfast last month. There's one glaring omission from the 23 names on the straw poll ballot: Jeb Bush, who asked not to be on the list. Christie dismisses lack of CPAC invite . ""It was our request to Mr. Cardenas when he extended the invite for Gov. Bush to speak. We asked not to be included, as Gov. Bush has said repeatedly, it is too early to think about 2016,"" Bush spokesperson Jaryn Emhof told CNN chief Washington correspondent Jake Tapper. For many conservative activists attending CPAC, the straw poll is fun, but they don't take it too seriously. ""I don't put much weight on it. It's a fun way of getting to see opinions, but it doesn't predict anything,"" said Ryan Robertson of Reston, Virginia. ""I did it for fun. Why not? But there's so much time between now and then,"" said Shelby Vest, a recent University of Florida graduate and first time straw poll voter. Teresa Ferguson of Albertville, Alabama, sees a value in the straw poll. ""We've got to start thinking about someone, don't we?"" She said the results may reflect the hopes and dreams of some, but added that the straw poll is ""a popularity contest.""

"(CNN) -- Britain's Chris Froome won the 17th stage of the Tour de France on Wednesday to strengthen his grip on the yellow jersey. Froome completed Wednesday's 32-kilometer time trial in 51 minutes 33 seconds, nine seconds ahead of Spain's Alberto Contador with his compatriot Joaquim Rodriguez Oliver finishing a further second behind in third. ""I couldn't believe it when I got over the line and saw I had the fastest time,"" Froome said after his third stage win of this year's tour. ""I went into today thinking I was going to try and limit my losses, thinking about the days to come now. So to go through the finish line with the fastest time, I really didn't see that coming."" On mountainous terrain along a frequently twisting route most of the riders opted for their traditional road bikes over the more aerodynamic machines used in time trials. But Froome opted to use both on the stage, switching to a time trial model for the final 12-kilometer descent. The swap proved decisive as the Briton clawed back a 20-second advantage Contador had built up earlier in the stage. The Spaniard now moves up to second overall, four minutes 34 seconds behind Froome with just four stages remaining. Contador's Saxo-Tinkoff teammate Roman Kreuziger is now third and trails Froome by four minutes and 51 seconds. Thursday sees the riders tackle the gruelling 172.5-kilometer 18th stage which concludes with a double ascent of Alpe d'Huez over the last 60 kilometers.","Chris Froome narrowly increases lead with a win on stage 17 of Tour de France .

"(Rolling Stone) -- Though a native New Yorker, Neil Diamond has become an inspirational figure in the city of Boston's recovery from the bombings at the Boston Marathon last week. Diamond's ""Sweet Caroline"" is a staple at the Red Sox' Fenway Park, and Saturday he made national news by being a surprise guest there to lead the crowd in a rousing rendition of the singalong at the team's first home game since the bombings. With the singer already in the midst of penning new material, he tells Rolling Stone he's been moved to write about the tragedy.

"(CNN) -- If you're like most people, me included, you may have trouble running an Olympics hurdle race without pulling a muscle. Google is here to help. The Internet giant on Tuesday embellished its search page with an animated, interactive doodle that lets users run the hurdles by tapping on their keyboards. Tapping the arrow keys makes the hurdler run, while hitting the space bar helps him leap over the 10 hurdles in his path. Each effort is timed, and runners can earn up to three virtual stars -- think of them as gold, silver or bronze medals. (Note from, ahem, personal experience: If you fail to clear a single hurdle, you win nothing and your runner hangs his head dejectedly at the finish line.) Bored office drones, say goodbye to your workplace productivity. Google's online hurdle race coincides, of course, with track and field events this week at the London Olympics. The brief animation is the latest in an occasional series of interactive Google doodles commemorating special events. Past doodles have let users observe a lunar eclipse, play notes on a virtual synthesizer to observe the 78th birthday of Robert Moog and elude ghosts in a playable online version of Pac-Man, the classic arcade game.

"(CNN) -- There was French fever as Christophe Riblon won stage 18 of the Tour de France -- but it was Britain's Chris Froome who extended his overall lead despite being handed a penalty. The famous Alpe d'Huez route asked more of the riders this year as, for the first time, the pack made a first ascent before descending back to the valley floor and then climbing the mountain for a second time. After an attacking ride, Froome fell foul of the energy-sapping conditions inside the last five kilometers of the 172-km route. The Briton sent his Sky team-mate Richie Porte back to the support car for food -- even though it is against the rules to 'feed' inside the last 20 kilometers of a stage. Race officials handed Froome a 20-second penalty but the yellow jersey holder still stretched his lead over rival Alberto Contador to five minutes, 11 seconds. ""Richie was feeling a lot better than I was and I was running out of sugars towards the end,"" explained Froome, who is aiming to win his first Tour de France after helping Sir Bradley Wiggins to the crown last year. ""I had to ask him to go back and grab me some sugars from the car. ""I was just getting in as best I could in those last few kilometers. I'm not sure if it made any difference at that point in the race. ""It's a horrible feeling and I'm just happy to have come out with more of an advantage than I had at the start of the stage. ""This was definitely one of the harder days that we've seen in this Tour but I think that's to be expected: two times up Alpe d'Huez and this late in the race, it's definitely a hard day."" With three stages left to go before the Tour reaches its climax on the streets of the French capital, Contador must also find an extra burst of energy. The Spaniard was unable to respond when Froome pushed on twice during the second ascent. ""I wasn't on a good day,"" said Contador. ""It was hot and very humid. But despite my setback I've limited my losses. I hope to have better legs in the next few days."" The fans, many in colorful fancy-dress costumes, had squeezed along the stunning route despite the odd rain shower or two. French kisses . They were rewarded with the first French stage winner on this year's Tour as Riblon picked off tiring American Tejay Van Garderen inside the final two kilometers. ""When I was about eight years old, I saw on the TV a victory of a cyclist at Alpe d'Huez and I hoped that one day maybe I could do it too,"" Riblon, who blew kisses to the crowd, said. ""When I saw at the start of the climb that Van Garderen attacked me I knew I couldn't follow him. ""Three kilometers from the finish, I saw him and he didn't look good so I started to believe in my good stars. And I sprinted and the public supported me and I'm in the sky!""

"Amman, Jordan (CNN) -- Controversial remarks made by the Jordanian ruling monarch to an American magazine triggered a domestic media uproar and denials from the royal palace, just days before the U.S. president was scheduled to visit Jordan. In an article published this week in The Atlantic, Jordan's King Abdullah was quoted calling the opposition Muslim Brotherhood a ""Masonic cult."" He also referred to tribal elders as ""old dinosaurs"" and spoke at length about how he could not trust his own intelligence agency. The profile quickly triggered a flurry of accusations and denials inside Jordan. It was debated on national television news Tuesday night, and denials from the royal court dominated the front pages of Jordanian newspapers. ""The article ... contained many fallacies, as statements were taken out of context,"" an informed royal court source said in a statement quoted by the state-run Petra news agency. ""The content of the article was analysis that reflected the writer's point of view and information attributed to his majesty inaccurately and in a dishonest manner,"" the statement said. ""The timing of it was really bad,"" said journalist and analyst Randa Habib, who is also the author of the book ""Hussein and Abdullah: Inside the Jordanian Royal Family."" ""The group that he called dinosaurs are the tribal elders who are the backbone of the monarchy,"" she added. ""People felt they were insulted."" U.S. President Barack Obama arrived in Israel on Wednesday -- his first trip to the country as president and part of his sweep across the Middle East, which will include visits to the West Bank and Jordan. Unlike Egypt, Tunisia, Yemen, Libya and Syria, the Jordanian monarchy has so far survived the wave of popular discontent widely referred to as the Arab Spring. But the government has faced significant challenges over the past two years. Jordan, a country long plagued by resource shortages, poverty and high unemployment, is going through a period of economic difficulty. In an effort to tame its ballooning international debt, the government began stripping fuel subsidies last fall. The move triggered nationwide protests in November. Jordanians have also watched with increasing worry as the civil war in neighboring Syria has sent hundreds of thousands of refugees streaming across the border. More than 450,000 officially registered Syrian refugees are now competing with Jordanians for scarce jobs, real estate and even water.","King Abdullah is quoted calling the opposition Muslim Brotherhood a ""Masonic cult""

"(CNN) -- The Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, commonly known as the FARC, released a soldier hostage on Saturday, the International Committee of the Red Cross reported. The soldier, identified as Josue Alvarez, was captured on January 30 in Narino, a department in southwest Colombia. He was released in that same department to a humanitarian team. ""We hope Mr. Alvarez will soon be reunited with his family,"" Jordi Raich, head of the ICRC delegation in Colombia, said in a statement. ""We are delighted that the operation went smoothly."" ICRC said it has facilitated the release of eight people this week, including Alvarez, two police officers, also held by the FARC, and five civilians, held by a second rebel group, known as the National Liberation Army, or ELN. The five civilians who were captured January 18 work for a mining company. The police officers were taken in Valle del Cauca, another department in southwest Colombia, and had been held since January 25. Their releases come amid peace talks between the government and the FARC. The two sides have been at war since the 1960s. Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos has said he wants talks wrapped up by November. There have been sporadic attempts at peace in the past. The last effort fell apart in 2002. Then-President Andres Pastrana ceded an area the size of Switzerland to the guerrilla group, but he ended negotiations after rebels launched a series of attacks across the country in an apparent bid to strengthen their position.

The book went on to become a best-seller. Millions of people in Indonesia live on fewer than $2 a day.

"(CNN) -- Eyes trained straight ahead, the 16 young men are as grim-faced as pall-bearers as they carry their respective team's boats down to the river's edge. Weighing on their broad shoulders isn't just a 20-meter vessel -- it's 184 years of tradition, six months of grueling physical training, and a fierce rivalry between two of the most prestigious universities in the world. Welcome to the Oxford-Cambridge Boat Race; 6.8 kilometers of sweat, tears, and the occasional sinking in London's River Thames. Almost every year since 1829, the universities' rowing teams have battled it out in arguably the greatest -- and most controversial -- grudge matches in Britain's sporting history. ""It's the preeminent student varsity match in the world,"" Matthew Pinsent, former Oxford rower and four-time Olympic gold medalist, told CNN. ""It's unlike any other rowing race -- it's a very long distance over a particularly torturous piece of river."" Oxford triumph . Oxford emerged victorious in the 159th edition of the race on Sunday, cruising over the finish line a length-and-a-half ahead of their rivals, under a torrent of jubilant expletives from cox Oskar Zorrilla. It was an emotional win for the team who named their boat after former cox and Olympic silver medalist Acer Nethercott, who died earlier this year from cancer, aged 35. But Oxford, better known as the ""dark blues,"" due to their distinctive uniforms, still trail behind Cambridge's ""light blues"" in the long history of the race -- 77 to 81. Indeed, giant billboards dotted along the riverbank screamed ""Which blue are you?"" to the thousands of onlookers who braved smatterings of snow to cheer on the rowers in their 17-minute crusade from Putney to Mortlake. Protest, elitism and wild boar sausages . There was none of the drama of last year, however, when Australian protester Trenton Oldfield brought the race to a standstill after plunging between the boats and narrowly avoiding the pounding oars. The anti-elitism campaigner served seven weeks in prison for the stunt -- though he's admitted if the weather had been this foul in 2012 he might have been more reluctant to dive into the murky Thames. Freezing weather aside, the Royal Marine Commandos weren't taking any chances, arming themselves with thermal imaging equipment as they patrolled the course. It appears that if Oldfield had hoped to discourage the stereotypical Barbour jacket-wearing ""hooray-henry"" crowd, he failed miserably. Going hand-in-hand with prestige is wealth, and the Oxford-Cambridge Boat Race is no exception. Beside the traditional pubs lining the riverbank this weekend were champagne-sponsored soirees and stalls selling wild boar sausages. If any more proof was needed of the race's upper-class flavor, it was surely found in the title sponsor -- global financial services firm BNY Mellon. Elitist? Far from it, argued Cambridge University Boat Club President, George Nash, who instead called the race ""the ultimate meritocracy."" ""You get to the university on your academic merit and you make the team on your rowing merit,"" he said. ""It doesn't matter who your parents are."" No pain, no gain . Regardless of its character, there's no disputing the race's reputation as a breeding ground for future Olympians. It regularly attracts the best athletes from across the world -- including U.S. competitors the Winklevoss twins, who rowed for Oxford in 2010 and are perhaps best known as the former business partners of Mark Zuckerberg, who alleged that Zuckerberg stole the idea for Facebook from them. Training is a grueling commitment which begins in September, and it's estimated that for every stroke made on race day, 600 have been made during practice. An average day will begin at 5am, with competitors training around five-hours-a day, seven-days-a-week. ""It's of the highest importance to us -- we sacrifice six months of our lives for 16 minutes,"" Nash said. ""I'd say there's definitely lots of cases where the boat race has caused many a break-up."" Tradition rules . Since old school chums Charles Merivale, a student at Cambridge, and Charles Wordsworth, of Oxford, first challenged each other to a rowing race in the early 19th century, the competition has gained legendary status in Britain, attracting millions of TV viewers each year. Fabled stories such as the ""1877 dead heat"" -- where judge ""Honest John"" Phelps had his view of the finish line obscured -- add to the almost mythical character of the competition. Tradition continues to loom large in the race which begins with the toss of an 1829 gold coin and ends with throwing the winning cox into the water. Today that strong sense of history sits happily beside state-of-the-art sports equipment and up-to-the-minute media coverage. And while opinion remains divided on its merit -- Telegraph journalist Tom Chivers described the boat race as ""fantastically boring"" -- there's no denying its enduring place in the nation's history.","Oxford University win 159th edition of prestigious boat race against Cambridge .

"Editor's note: Peter Bergen, CNN's national security analyst, is a fellow at the New America Foundation, a Washington-based think tank that promotes innovative thought from across the ideological spectrum, and at New York University's Center on Law and Security. He's the author of ""The Osama bin Laden I Know: An Oral History of al Qaeda's Leader."" Peter Bergen says Osama bin Laden is still alive and still significant eight years after September 11. HELMAND, Afghanistan (CNN) -- Eight years after September 11, the ""war on terror"" has gone the way of the dodo. And President Obama talks instead about a war against al Qaeda and its allies. What, then, of al Qaeda's enigmatic leader, Osama bin Laden, who has vanished like a wisp of smoke? And does he even matter now? The U.S. government hadn't had a solid lead on al Qaeda's leader since the battle of Tora Bora in winter 2001. Although there are informed hypotheses that today he is in Pakistan's North West Frontier Province on the Afghan border, perhaps in one of the more northerly areas such as Bajaur, these are essentially guesses, not ""actionable"" intelligence. A longtime American counterterrorism analyst explained to me, ""There is very limited collection on him personally."" That's intelligence community shorthand for the fact that the usual avenues of ""collection"" on a target such as bin Laden are yielding little or no information about him. Those avenues typically include signal intercepts of phone calls and e-mails, as well as human intelligence from spies. Given the hundreds of billions of dollars that the ""war on terror"" has consumed, the failure to capture or kill al Qaeda's leader is one of its signal failures. Does it even matter whether bin Laden is found? Yes, it does. First, there is the matter of justice for the almost 3,000 people who died in the September 11 attacks and for the thousands of other victims of al Qaeda's attacks around the world. Second, every day that bin Laden remains at liberty is a propaganda victory for al Qaeda. Third, although bin Laden and his deputy Ayman al-Zawahiri aren't managing al Qaeda's operations on a daily basis they guide the overall direction of the jihadist movement around the world, even while they are in hiding. Those messages from al Qaeda's leaders have reached untold millions worldwide via television, the Internet and newspapers. The tapes have not only instructed al Qaeda's followers to continue to kill Westerners and Jews, but some also carried specific instructions that militant cells then acted on. In March 2008, for instance, the al Qaeda leader denounced the publication of cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed in a Danish newspaper as a ""catastrophe"" for which punishment would soon be meted out. Three months later, an al Qaeda suicide attacker bombed the Danish Embassy in Islamabad, killing six. Some reading this may think: But what's the proof that the al Qaeda leader is still alive? Plenty. Since September 11, bin Laden has released a slew of video and audiotapes, many of which discuss current events. After a nine-month silence, for instance, bin Laden released a 22-minute audiotape on March 14, sharply condemning the recent Israeli invasion of Gaza. Are these tapes real? Not one of the dozens of tapes released by bin Laden after 9/11 has been a fake. Indeed the U.S. government has authenticated many of them using bin Laden's distinctive voiceprint. And what about the persistent reports that he is ill? In 2002, Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf said bin Laden had kidney disease, for which he required a dialysis machine, and was therefore likely dead. But the stories of bin Laden's life-threatening kidney problems are false, judging by his appearance in videos that he released in 2004 and again in 2007, in which he showed no signs of illness. On the 2007 tape, the al Qaeda leader had even dyed his white-flecked beard black, suggesting that as the Saudi militant entered his fifth decade, he was not immune to a measure of vanity about his personal appearance. In fact, bin Laden looked much better in those videos than he did in the video he released shortly after the battle of Tora Bora in late 2001, where he had narrowly escaped being killed in a massive American attack. The situation is further complicated by the fact that bin Laden and al-Zawahiri are almost certainly hiding out in the tribal areas of Pakistan, on the Afghan border. Arthur Keller, a CIA officer who ran a spy network in Pakistan's tribal areas in 2006, told me the problems of working in the region: ""It's an incredibly remote area. They're hiding in a sea of people that are very xenophobic of outsiders, so it's a very, very tough nut to crack."" An additional factor operating in bin Laden's favor is the personal popularity he has long enjoyed in Pakistan. Three years after the September 11 attacks, for instance, a Pew poll found that al Qaeda's leader had a 65 percent favorability rating among Pakistanis. However, it is clear from the videos of bin Laden and al-Zawahiri that aired in the years since the attacks that they are not living in caves. In those tapes, both men's clothes were clean and well-pressed. Caves generally don't have laundry facilities. And the videos that they have released are well-lit and well-shot productions, suggesting access either to electrical outlets or to generators to run lights. Al-Zawahiri is often filmed in a library setting, and on one of his videos from March 2006, there are curtains clearly visible behind him, suggesting that the tape was shot in a house. By early 2008, the Bush administration had tired of the Pakistani government's unwillingness or inability to take out al Qaeda's leaders, and in July, the president authorized Special Operations forces to carry out ground assaults in the tribal regions without the permission of the Pakistani government. But in the face of the intense Pakistani opposition to American boots on the ground, the Bush administration chose to rely instead on drones to target suspected al Qaeda and Taliban leaders. Bush ordered the CIA to expand its attacks with Predator and Reaper drones. Between July 2008 and this month, U.S. drones have killed dozens of lower-ranking militants and at least 10 mid- and upper-level leaders within al Qaeda or the Taliban. This strategy seems to have worked, at least in terms of combating the ability of al Qaeda to plan or carry out attacks in the West. Law-enforcement authorities have uncovered no serious plots against U.S. or European targets that were traceable to militants who had received training in Pakistan's tribal regions after the drone program had been dramatically ramped up there. The increased pace of the American drone attacks in Pakistani's tribal areas was motivated in part by the hope that it would increase panicked communications among the militants, which might help pinpoint the locations of the top leaders in al Qaeda or the Taliban, but that approach has not paid off when it comes to bin Laden. If killing bin Laden with a drone has proved difficult, so too will be capturing him alive. His former bodyguard Abu Jandal told Al Quds al Arabi newspaper, ""Sheikh Osama gave me a pistol. ... The pistol had only two bullets, for me to kill Sheikh Osama with in case we were surrounded or he was about to fall into the enemy's hands, so that he would not be caught alive "" Should bin Laden be captured or killed, that would probably trigger a succession battle within al Qaeda. While al-Zawahiri is the deputy leader of the terror group and therefore technically bin Laden's successor, he is not regarded as a natural leader. Indeed, even among his fellow Egyptian militants, al-Zawahiri is seen as a divisive force, and so he is unlikely to be able to step into the role of leader of al Qaeda and of the world jihadist movement that is occupied by bin Laden. By the law of averages, eventually, bin Laden will be captured or killed. Yet the ideological movement that he helped spawn -- ""Binladenism"" -- will live on long after he is gone. That is bin Laden's legacy. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Peter Bergen.","Peter Bergen: Osama bin Laden still inspires al Qaeda .

"(CNN) -- Brittany Wenger learned about artificial intelligence during a seventh-grade school project. She was immediately enthralled, bought a book on programming and taught herself how to code. Now 17, Wenger won the grand prize at the second annual Google Science Fair on Monday for her project on improving breast cancer diagnosis accuracy using artificial neural networks. That combination of drive, passion for science and a desire to do something good was common at this year's event. Organizers of the online science fair received thousands of entries from 100 countries, including India, Ukraine, Malta and Swaziland. Google picked 15 finalists and, at a final gala in an airplane hangar in Palo Alto, announced the winners in three age categories, along with a grand-prize winner. Jonah Kohn, 14, won first place in his age group for a project that helps people with hearing loss experience music through vibrations. A team of three 15- and 16-year-olds from Spain took home a trophy (made entirely out of Legos) for their look at the microscopic creatures that thrive in fresh water. Two 15-year-old young men from Swaziland researched hydroponic techniques to help subsistence farmers in their homeland, where food shortages are a devastating problem. They won the Science in Action award, which highlighted a project making a practical difference. Before the winners were announced, the finalists presented their projects one last time on the Google campus Monday afternoon. Groups of young kids from summer camps filed through to meet the young scientists and watch their demonstrations. Some Google employees even brought their children to work for the day just to see the event. In classic Silicon Valley fashion, many adults were there grilling presenters, just like they would any entrepreneur with a pitch. They asked tough questions about methodology, costs and results. Some even asked about business plans. One man urged finalist Rohit Fenn to make his eco-friendly toilet design, the Vacu-flush, open source. Fenn's prototype uses a vacuum system that consumes 50% less water than traditional toilets. Unfortunately, his design is still too cost-prohibitive to be made made without the help of established toilet manufacturers. ""They would need to take me seriously, which they won't because I'm 16 years old,"" he said. The contest was free to enter and open to all students around the world between 13 and 18 years of age. Google collected entries from January to April and announced the finalists in May. The grand prize winner receives a $50,000 scholarship, an internship and a trip to the Galapagos Islands. For Wenger, one of the highlights of the experience was meeting famed computer scientist Vint Cerf, who talked with her at length about computer science and neural networks. For her winning project, Wenger wrote a program that improves diagnoses of malignant breast tumors by using a large amount of data stored online and looking for patterns. It's an ambitious project that was made possible by that first spark of interest in programming five years ago . ""I decided that it was what I was going to do,"" said the Florida native. ""I'm very persistent, and I learned to code, and I started coding neural networks that played soccer -- I'm an avid soccer player as well.""","Google announced the winners of its second annual science fair Monday .

"Doha, Qatar (CNN) -- An international donors' conference on Darfur kicked off Sunday in Doha with the hope of raising $7.25 billion to bring aid and sustainable development to the troubled region in Sudan. ""There is an opportunity to assist the people of Darfur through massive generosity,"" said Ali Al-Zatari, the representative of the United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon in Sudan. ""Darfur still needs stability,"" Al-Zatari added. He said 3.5 million people need humanitarian assistance, and 1.5 million of them live in camps. The conference, whose participants include the UN, the governments of Qatar and Sudan, and the World Bank, seeks to ""to mobilize financial support for the recovery and development needs in Darfur."" Reactions to the conference, however, are mixed. ""The conference is a strong message to the Darfurian people that they are not forgotten,"" said Abdullah Adam Khatir, a Darfurian writer. ""It will take time, it's a process,."" Al-Baqir Afifi, a civil society activist, on the other hand, disagreed with the conference's approach. ""Those who are going to pledge money want to know if the money is going to reach Darfur or not,"" he said. ""It is still insecure in Darfur; there is chaos,"" he added. Protests against the conference took place in some camps in Darfur last week. ""What are they going to do with this money when there is no security?"" an activist who preferred not to be named said, according to AFP. Violence broke out in Darfur in 2003 when non-Arab rebel groups took up arms against the central government in Khartoum, accusing it of neglect and discrimination. In response, the government of Sudan unleashed a massive counterinsurgency using militias known as the janjaweed. The violence that followed has led to the deaths of 300,000 people, according to United Nations figures from 2008. The Sudanese government says that 10,000 have died. The International Criminal Court as a result indicted Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir for war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide allegedly committed in Darfur. One rebel group, the Liberation and Justice Movement signed a peace agreement with the Sudanese government in 2011 known as the Doha Document for Peace, but progress on the deal has been slow. Three other rebel groups have refused to sign the document. On Sunday, a splinter group from the Justice and Equality Movement, the largest Darfurian rebel group, signed a ""final peace agreement"" with the Sudanese government.","The United Nations, World Bank and governments convene to raise money for Darfur .

"(CNN) -- Police have arrested a second suspect in connection with a shooting at a Texas community college that left three wounded, officials said Friday. Trey Foster, 22, was charged with aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, said Christina Garza, media manager at the Harris County Sheriff's Office. Foster was arrested in Plano, Texas, more than 250 miles north of the scene of the shooting, at the North Harris campus of Lone Star College just outside Houston. The shooting garnered wide media attention amid early fears that once again, a gunman was on the loose on a campus. Harris County officials have said the January 22 shooting apparently stemmed from an argument between two men. At least one had a student ID. Both were wounded by gunfire and treated at a hospital. Another man, 22-year-old Carlton Berry, was arrested on the day of the shooting and charged with aggravated assault. A maintenance worker also was shot. He was struck in the leg. The shooting took place outside, between the academic building and the library. CNN's Dana Ford and Catherine E. Shoichet contributed to this report.","A second arrest is made in the shooting at Lone Star College .

"(CNN) -- Greg Mortenson, the high-profile advocate of girls' education in Afghanistan and Pakistan, has been forced to defend his best-selling book ""Three Cups of Tea: One Man's Mission to Fight Terrorism and Build Nations ... One School at a Time,"" against charges that key stories in it are false. Mortenson shot to international fame with the book, which describes his getting lost in an effort to climb K2, the world's second-highest peak, being rescued by Pakistani villagers in the village of Korphe and vowing to return there to build a school for local girls. He also claims to have been captured by the Taliban and held for several days before being released. Another best selling-author, however -- Jon Krakauer of ""Into Thin Air"" fame -- told a CBS ""60 Minutes"" investigation that aired Sunday that the story is not true. ""It's a beautiful story, and it's a lie,"" Krakauer tells the program. ""Three Cups of Tea,"" co-authored by writer David Oliver Relin, stayed on The New York Times best-seller list for four years after it was first published in 2006, becoming a global publishing sensation that has sold more than three million copies and been translated into 47 languages. CNN.com interviews Greg Mortenson in 2008 . Mortenson is also the author of the 2009 sequel ""Stones into Schools: Promoting Peace with Books, not Bombs, in Afghanistan and Pakistan,"" which was another Times best-seller. Both books recount Mortenson's quest to bring schools to some of the remotest parts of Pakistan and Afghanistan on the theory that education -- especially for girls -- is the best way to end the scourge of the Taliban and other extremists in the region. Mortenson's publisher, Penguin Books, modestly describes him as ""a real-life Indiana Jones."" Mortenson's quest to end extremism through education has made him a darling of the U.S. military. A photograph in ""Stones into Schools"" shows U.S. President Barack Obama's top military adviser, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs Adm. Mike Mullen, opening a girls' school in northern Afghanistan with Mortenson in 2009. Krakauer is a climber and former donor to Mortenson's charity. CBS said he was one of Mortenson's earliest backers, donating $75,000 to his cause, but withdrew his support over concerns the charity was being mismanaged. He tells CBS News investigator Steve Kroft in the Sunday broadcast that a ""close friend"" of Mortenson's who hiked back with him from K2 says Mortenson never heard of Korphe, the village he says he stumbled into, until a year after the failed climbing attempt. In a transcript of Mortenson's written responses to questions posed to him by CBS -- a transcript posted on the website of Mortenson's charitable organization, the Central Asia Institute -- the author denies the claim is false. Read more about the Central Asia Institute at its website . He says he did visit Korphe in 1993, after his failed attempt to climb K2, but that the local people ""have a completely different notion about time"" than those in the West, implying they would not have been able to recount the exact year he visited. ""60 Minutes"" also raised questions about the veracity of other episodes in the book, including his supposed 1996 kidnapping in the remote Pakistani tribal region of Waziristan, along the Afghan border. That story is one of the more exciting episodes in ""Three Cups of Tea."" Over the course of a chapter, Mortenson describes being kidnapped by Waziri tribesmen and detained in a makeshift prison by Kalashnikov-toting guards for eight days, at which point he was suddenly released. In ""Stones into Schools,"" Mortenson even provides a photo of his kidnappers, 13 fierce-looking tribesmen, many of whom are clutching guns. CBS said it found four of the men in the picture and that all denied being Taliban. The network said the men provided another photo of the group with Mortenson, and in it, the author is shown holding an AK-47. The photos raise a question about the truth of Mortenson's claim that he was abducted. It is somewhat unusual for a group of kidnappers to pose for a photograph in which all their faces can be clearly seen. Gary Noesner, the former chief hostage negotiator at the FBI who has worked on 120 kidnapping cases, says it is ""not common but not unheard of"" for kidnappers to pose for pictures. One of the supposed kidnappers in Mortenson's photo is Mansur Khan Mahsud, who directs a Pakistani think tank that specializes in research in Pakistan's tribal regions. (Mahsud has done research for the New America Foundation, where Peter Bergen is a director.) Contacted by CNN, Mahsud said Mortenson's account of his trip to Waziristan ""is a pack of lies and not a single word of it is true."" Mahsud elaborated that Mortenson had come to South Waziristan in 1996 with one of Mahsud's relatives and had stayed in the family village, Kot Langer Khel, for more than a week. Rather than being kidnapped, Mahsud says, his family treated Mortenson as ""an honored guest"" and adds, ""We were his protector in South Waziristan."" On his website, gregmortenson.com, Mortenson claims the kidnapping was carried out by the Taliban. However, the Taliban had no presence in Waziristan in 1996, only arriving in the region after their fall from power in Afghanistan in the winter of 2001. The Taliban had also banned photography at the time that they had supposedly kidnapped Mortenson. In the transcript posted on the institute website, Mortenson stands by his claim of being ""detained"" for eight days in Waziristan in 1996. ""It was against my will, and my passport and money were taken from me,"" Mortenson says in the transcript. ""I was not mistreated or harmed, but I was also not allowed to leave. A blanket was put over my head any time I was moved by vehicle."" He continues, ""A 'Talib' means student in Arabic, and yes there were Taliban in the region. ... Some people are Taliban, some are not, and affiliations change overnight, often on a whim."" Friday, the Montana-based Mortenson gave an interview to the Bozeman Daily Chronicle in which he said, ""I thought it best to befriend the people detaining me,"" and added the men who had detained him may have perceived the episode differently. In an e-mail sent Sunday to supporters, Mortenson says the ""60 Minutes"" interview ""paints a distorted picture using inaccurate information, innuendo, and a microscopic focus on one year's (2009) IRS 990 financial, and a few points in the book 'Three Cups of Tea' that occurred almost 18 years ago."" Mortenson also issued a rejection of the ""60 Minutes"" allegations in a statement issued Friday by the Central Asia Institute, in advance of the broadcast. ""I stand by the information conveyed in my book,"" Mortenson said. He also defended ""the value of CAI's work in empowering local communities to build and operate schools that have educated more than 60,000 students."" He described Afghanistan and Pakistan as ""complex places torn by conflicting loyalties, and some who do not want our mission of educating girls to succeed."" Mortenson declined CBS' requests for an interview and CNN has not been able to reach him. He says in the e-mail that he declined to appear on camera with CBS ""after they attempted an eleventh-hour aggressive approach to reach me"" and he decided they had a ""disrespectful approach"" that would result in an unfair and imbalanced report. ""The '60 Minutes' program may appear to ask simple questions, but the answers are often complex, not easily encapsulated in 10-second soundbites,"" Mortenson writes. His institute also said in a statement to CNN on Sunday that he is not commenting in person because of a medical condition. ""Greg has been suffering from hypoxia (low oxygen condition) for about 20 months, even though he still works nonstop. Last Friday, he was diagnosed with a tear hole in his heart wall that causes significant blood shunting and he will have a heart surgical procedure done on Thursday to correct it. Once his cardiologist allows he will be able to comment on his story in person,"" the statement said. Mortenson's record of charity and his tales of derring-do have helped fuel the Central Asia Institute. The organization recorded income of $14 million in 2009, the vast majority of which was raised from private individuals, many of them who were no doubt inspired by Mortenson's books. However, in 2009, less than half of that money -- 41 percent -- actually went to building schools in Afghanistan and Pakistan, according to the institute's board of directors. On its website, the institute said ""a significant portion of the remainder"" was dedicated to the charity's other programs, such as outreach and education about the need for the schools. The institute also says $1.7 million went to promote Mortenson's books in the form of advertising, events, film and professional fees, and some travel. It said the contributions generated by Mortenson's promotional events ""far exceed the travel expenses."" Daniel Borachoff, president of the American Institute of Philanthropy, told CBS the institute has issued only one audited financial statement in the 14 years of its existence, and that it demonstrates a lack of transparency and ""disappointing"" intermingling of Mortenson's personal interests with those of his charity. Krakauer also said he has concerns about the finances of Mortenson's organization. ""Nobody is overseeing what goes on. He doesn't know how many schools he's built. Nobody knows how much these schools cost,"" he said. In the e-mail, Mortenson says he recently returned from Afghanistan, where his organization plans to establish and built more than 60 new schools this year. He also says he is scheduled for surgery this week to fix the hole in his heart, and ""after a few weeks my doctor says I will be as good as new."" CNN's Maria Ebrahimji and Richard Greene contributed to this report.","A CBS ""60 Minutes"" investigation alleges the book's stories are not true .

"(Wired) -- Google's search engine was created when most of the Web's information was open and available to anyone willing to capture it. In today's more restrictive environment, Google co-founder Sergey Brin and CEO Larry Page may not have even tried to start the company. ""The kind of environment that we developed Google in, the reason that we were able to develop a search engine, is the Web was so open,"" Brin told The Guardian. ""Once you get too many rules, that will stifle innovation."" In an interview published Sunday, Google's co-founder cited a wide range of attacks on ""the open Internet,"" including government censorship and interception of data, overzealous attempts to protect intellectual property, and new communication portals that use web technologies and the internet, but under restrictive corporate control. There are ""very powerful forces that have lined up against the open internet on all sides and around the world,"" says Brin. ""I thought there was no way to put the genie back in the bottle, but now it seems in certain areas the genie has been put back in the bottle."" Not coincidentally, these forces map directly onto three of Google's biggest headaches as a business in the past few years. There's no way for Google's servers to crawl Facebook's pages or Apple's smartphone apps for information. YouTube's video clips, Google Books and other key initiatives have had to grapple with both the media industries and government court rulings or legislation. And besides having to withdraw from China to Hong Kong after a series of attacks and new censorship rules, Google has been compelled to hand over user information to the U.S. government, sometimes without being able to legally notify those users. ""If we could be in some magical jurisdiction that everyone in the world trusted, that would be great,"" says Brin. ""We're doing it as well as can be done."" Brin lists several other threats to the open Web (and to Google): . -- Smartphone apps, as led by Apple: ""all the information in apps -- that data is not crawlable by Web crawlers. You can't search it."" -- Facebook, where data goes in but never comes out: ""Facebook has been sucking down Gmail contacts for many years."" -- SOPA and PIPA, which Brin says would have led to the U.S. using the same content-screening technology it has criticized China and Iran for using. With SOPA and PIPA, says Brin, fears of piracy had reduced the media industry to ""shooting itself in the foot, or maybe worse than in the foot."" Still, there's a profound audacity in Brin bundling Internet censorship in regimes like China, Saudi Arabia and Iran, which restrict user access to the web, with Facebook and Apple's platforms, which restrict Google's. There may be a continuum of control and closure of the Internet that connects repressive governments at one end and overbearing corporations at the other. The fight over the SOPA/PIPA legislation, where entertainment and technology companies, along with their users, fought it out in the halls of Congress, doubtlessly lies somewhere in between. But Google is likewise doubtlessly a part of that continuum, not apart from it. Because of its origin and the nature of its business, Google's prospects are inexorably tied to the fate of the open Web. But we have to resist the urge to make the two identical.

"(CNN) -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu apologized Friday to Turkey for a 2010 raid on a Gaza-bound flotilla, both nations said, signaling a potential major thaw after three years of chilly relations between the two key Middle East nations. The Israeli leader phoned his Turkish counterpart, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, while sitting with U.S. President Barack Obama in a trailer on a Tel Aviv airport tarmac. In the call -- which Turkey's foreign minister said lasted for nearly 30 minutes -- Netanyahu acknowledged ""operational mistakes"" during the raid, which ended with eight Turks and an American of Turkish origin dead. ""(Netanyahu) made it clear that the tragic results regarding the Mavi Marmara were unintentional and that Israel expresses regret over injuries and loss of life,"" the Israeli government said. Erdogan accepted the apology, which came shortly after he talked with the leaders of Egypt and Qatar. Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu said later on state TV, according to the semiofficial Anadolu news agency, that all Turkey's demands had been met. It wasn't immediately clear what impact the conversation might have on a region that is already home to numerous crises -- such as the deadly, two-year-long civil war in Syria and tensions over Iran's nuclear programs. At the least, the movement toward mending a rift between two of Washington's top allies appeared to be a boon for Obama, who said he's been appealing to Netanyahu and Erdogan ""for the last two years"" for them to fix ""this rupture."" ""There are obviously going to still be some significant disagreements ... but they also have a wide range of shared interests, and they both happen to be extraordinarily strong partners and friends of ours,"" Obama said at a press conference with Jordan's King Abdullah II. ""So it's in the interest of the United States that they begin this process of getting their relationship back in order."" 'An important step' While there was little public indication ahead of a time that there would be a breakthrough Thursday, Davutoglu said it actually came after three years of tough negotiations. The talks picked up steam in the past week, spurred by U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and other officials, the Turkish foreign minister added. On Thursday, Obama said he talked with Netanyahu about his reaching out to Erdogan, ""and both of us agreed that the moment was right."" The U.S. president at one point got on the call between the two Middle East leaders, said two senior administration officials who labeled the call ""an important step"" in normalizing Turkish-Israeli ties. ""During my visit, it appeared that the timing was good for that conversation to take place,"" Obama said, without elaborating. Turkey and Israel have been two pro-Western political, economic, and military linchpins in the Middle East, and their falling out has hurt initiatives to tackle problems in the region, such as the Syrian civil war and tensions relating to Iran's nuclear aspirations. A Muslim member of NATO, Turkey long had been Israel's most significant Muslim friend, and the deterioration of relations between the two nations intensified the Jewish state's isolation in the region, more unstable in light of the Arab Spring and other ferment in the Middle East. Erdogan's critical rhetoric toward Israeli policies in Gaza have been hailed by many in the Arab world. It's not clear when and if such steps as fully normalizing relations and returning ambassadors to their posts will be taken. Earlier Israel had sent out a statement saying those steps had been agreed upon, but it later amended its statement by removing those points. There also was no word on whether the once-close nations would resume the joint military exercises that were suspended after the Mavi Marmara incident. Turkey had been prosecuting four Israeli soldiers in absentia, and Israel initially said the two leaders agreed to the cancellation of legal steps against the troops. Later, however, its amended statement omitted that action as well. Agreeing to work together . In Thursday's conversation, Erdogan told Netanyahu that he thought the deterioration of ties between the countries was regrettable, especially given ""the shared history and centuries old ties of strong friendship and cooperation between the Jewish and Turkish peoples."" According to a statement released by the Turkish government, Erdogan discussed with his Israeli counterpart the ""importance of a just, lasting and comprehensive resolution of the Israel-Palestine conflict on the basis of the two-state vision."" The two leaders ""agreed to work together to improve the humanitarian situation in the Palestinian territories,"" the Turkish statement said. The Israeli government said in a statement the two sides would ""work to improve the humanitarian situation in the Palestinian territories,"" with Netanyahu noting Israel has ""substantially lifted the restrictions"" on entry of civilian goods into Gaza. Helping the Palestinian people had long been a concern for Turkey, and was the reason ostensibly that the flotilla set sail for Gaza in the first place. Israel long has voiced concerns about arms smuggling to Gaza militants intent on attacking the Jewish state. Gaza is controlled by Hamas, an anti-Israel group regarded as a terrorist organization by the United States and Israel. But activists say Israel's embargo of goods into Gaza from land and sea punishes civilians in the tiny and densely populated strip of land along the Mediterranean coast. Israel has said any organization or state that wants to give humanitarian aid to Gaza can do so in coordination with Israeli authorities via existing land crossings into the Palestinian territory. All that said, the highlight of the conversation dealt with the 2009 raid. Israel has long stood by the operation, though its tune publicly changed Friday. ""In light of Israel's investigation into the incident, which pointed out several operational mistakes, Prime Minister Netanyahu expressed Israel's apology to the Turkish people for any mistakes that might have led to loss of life or injury and agreed to conclude an agreement on compensation/nonliability,"" the Israeli government said. Asked to confirm whether Netanyahu called and apologized and offered compensation, as Ankara had long demanded, a senior Turkish official told CNN: ""Yes."" Erdogan only said they ""agreed to conclude an agreement on compensation/nonliability."" One Palestinian-Israeli lawmaker doesn't like it . Hanin Zoabi, a Palestinian activist who was on the Mavi Marmara and also is a Palestinian member of Israel's parliament, said she does not accept Netanyahu's apology. She wants an international court to try the people ""involved in the political decision that gave a green light to kill the political activists on the Marmara."" She said Netanyahu's push to improve Israeli-Turkish ties is undermining the Palestinians' demands -- such as ending Israeli occupation of the West Bank and the Israeli military and economic strictures on Gaza. She said Netanyahu is trying to evade that and other issues. ""The issue is not only Marmara, Marmara was the small crime. The big crime was the siege on Gaza,"" she told CNN. Gulden Sonme -- a spokeswoman for IHH, the Muslim aid agency that operated the Mavi Marmara == called the apology ""a positive political development."" ""But in terms of the need for the blockade on Gaza to end and in terms of the ongoing case to punish those who are responsible for the crimes committed during the raid, the legal process will continue,"" she said, referring to the case against the soldiers. Suat Kiniklioglu, a Turkish political analyst and former parliamentarian from Erdogan's party, said the apology is important because it shows ""to the world that there is a political price to kill Turkish citizens in international waters."" ""Probably in the Middle East, as well, it will be seen as political victory for the Erdogan government. But what matters more is the normalization itself, the obvious benefits to Turkey and Israel as well as the Palestinians.""

"(CNN) -- This week's announcement that Yahoo is hiring away Google executive Marissa Mayer as its latest CEO has been met by both Wall Street and the tech industry with yawns or worse. Yawners cite the fact that Yahoo -- by all measures, a company that has been in decline for some time -- has hired five CEOs in as many years. The fanfare with which they are brought in is matched only by the size of the failure they leave in their wake. Those who are excited about the new appointment seem to care less about what it means for Yahoo or the Internet than the fact that Mayer is a woman, pregnant, and a former girlfriend of Google chief Larry Page. Tech: Know Yahoo's Marissa Mayer in 11 facts . But the real story here, the part that no one seems to want to talk about, is that Mayer could breathe life not just into this failing company, but into the World Wide Web itself, which seems to have gone out of favor in Silicon Valley, where ""social"" is the only mantra. In fact, the very morning I learned that Mayer had been snatched from Google to Yahoo, I got a special notice on my iGoogle screen: iGoogle, the Google Web portal I had been using for the past two years, was going to be retired. A Web portal is simply a starting screen -- a customizable dashboard from which one gets the gist of what's going on elsewhere on the Internet, such as summaries of news headlines, weather forecast, stock quotes, sports scores, e-mail headers, and so on. For many of us who use our Web browsers to peruse and pursue information, it's a very convenient ""place"" to use as a starting page. Tech: How can Yahoo be saved? Mayer was largely responsible for the iGoogle page and the ease with which users could install or even create ""modules"" for it. The Web was her turf at the company, and she developed tools such as Gmail and Google maps -- the kinds of Web-based technologies that successfully competed with and overtook the once dominant Yahoo in that space. But as Google struggles to compete with Facebook, Twitter and the iPhone, the Web no longer seems to be where the action is. True enough, when we're using our smartphones we're much less likely to be thumbing through a tiny browser than to be engaging with people and information through individual apps like Yelp or Instagram. The whole notion of ""places"" online has given way to streams and flows of information that follow us (sometimes even through GPS) wherever we happen to be. Opinion: What signal is Marissa Mayer giving to Yahoo employees? So it's not surprising that in its desperate efforts to beat the iPhone with Android, Facebook with Google+, and Twitter with, well, something to come, Google would look back on the Web and its portal as last decade's war. Companies usually fail by sticking with obsolete technologies (like landlines and photographic film) instead of moving into the future. In an effort to focus on the future and please shareholders, Google is shedding what it sees as obsolete technologies. In doing so, however, Google is leaving the Web open for Yahoo to reclaim. Yahoo already has Web-dominant properties in YahooFinance and YahooSports, which both exceed Google's offerings in breadth and usage. YahooFinance's message boards are brimming with activity. Google's are ghost towns. MyYahoo.com, the original all-purpose Web portal, has always been more functional and user-friendly than Google's. On iGoogle, The New York Times looks generic; on MyYahoo, it retains its characteristic masthead and typeface. In spite of all this, however, Google was able to overtake Yahoo's Web presence -- largely due to the proliferation of Google apps and the overwhelming popularity of its Web search tool. Tech: Six life lessons from Yahoo CEO . I believe Google is abandoning the Web at its own peril, and in a misguided effort to compete on the much more ephemeral playing fields of social media and handheld gadgets. The Web is not over yet, not by a long shot. On the other hand, by hiring Google's Web visionary -- the very executive who beat them at their own game -- Yahoo is double-downing on the Web. The company may even figure out how to bring the Web to smartphones and social media before these newer technologies render browsing obsolete. I, for one, am glad Yahoo somehow stuck this out. No matter how pervasive and ubiquitous computing gets, most of us still need locations and frameworks to orient ourselves in cyberspace. Living: If Mayer can have it all, can you? Yahoo was the first and best at creating this sense of place, and now it stands on the brink of becoming the dominant player once again, simply by staying put.

"(CNN) -- It's a truth of the modern digital age: If you're using a Web service for free, you're not the customer. You're probably the product. The sites we visit, the videos we watch, the purchases we make and the items we reward with a Facebook ""like"" or a Google ""+1"" -- all of that, and more, eventually melds together into a data set that lets many of the world's most popular Web companies get to know us better. And they're using it to make billions of dollars. But what if Web users could reclaim their online data and benefit, or maybe even profit, from it? That's what a group of new startups want to happen. They say that instead of giving away data to tech titans who turn around and use it to target advertising, users should get something in return. ""I think what's happening now is that, finally, people are becoming aware of how their data's being used,"" said Shane Green, CEO of a company called Personal. ""And in the future, they're not going to be just giving this stuff up."" With Personal, users can import data from sites like Facebook and LinkedIn and info like their Web-browsing histories and purchases to a secure ""data vault."" From there, they can pretty much add anything they want, from computer passwords to medical information to emergency contacts for the babysitter. One feature even allows people to enter ID information like Social Security numbers, promising that they'll never have to spend time filling out an online form again. From there, they choose who to share with, be it the aforementioned babysitter or co-workers or family members. But Green sees a future in which they could choose to share it more publicly, in exchange for cash or other benefits. So, for example, if someone had been searching websites to buy a particular make and model of car, they could choose to make that publicly known. Car dealers using the site could then theoretically send targeted deals or offers. ""We'd love to see it sort of filtered ... where you're commanding the best deals, the best discounts -- and even direct compensation -- for the chance to meet me this way,"" he said. Intriguing, maybe. But is that just a way to invite digital junk mail? ""That couldn't be further from the vision we have,"" Green said. ""The model that's going to emerge is one where people, in a much safer and more controlled environment, let some of their data filter out and decide what kind of people will be able to even reach them at all. And when they do, they won't know their identity."" The problem, at least so far, is that Web players like Google and Facebook are already getting a lot of that data for free. ""The killer app isn't here yet,"" William Hoffman, who is working on a data study for the World Economic Forum, told the New York Times. But he says that might soon change. ""I'm willing to bet that within the next 12 months, something big will catch on,"" he said. Jason Cavnar's company, Singly, doesn't aim to one day earn users a direct payout. In fact, he says, it doesn't even need to combat the Web's current data-scraping model. ""The price of using free Web services shouldn't be our privacy. But until there are market solutions, I don't see that trend changing,"" he said. ""What we're doing is more about actually making the data you create useful."" Like Personal, Singly lets users compile all their data in one place via a sort of data locker. (The Locker Project is its ongoing open-source effort to let developers change and improve it.) They cite some of the same convenience benefits of doing so that Personal does. (Both projects, it should be noted, are in their early phases.) But what Singly has set out to do is let developers create hyper-personalized apps that would use that information. ""We're trying to create a new push for creativity, a new push for experiences,"" he said. ""We're starting to see the power of personal apps, but there are not nearly enough of them. ""We want to make sure the creator has less of an engineering challenge to making your data awesome."" Green started Personal in 2009. At the time, he said, friends in the tech industry told him that it was folly, that he'd never convince many people to care about how their data is used online. Fast-forward three years, and just a week's worth of headlines tell a different story. Members of Congress and dozens of state attorneys have publicly questioned Google's new privacy policy, which will pull data from its many products into one user profile. President Barack Obama unveiled an online bill of rights aimed at protecting users' privacy on the Web and says legislation could be next. And on Facebook, which has been no stranger to data-sharing controversy, some users are bracing for a change to the Timeline feature that they fear will make their past activity too easy for others to find. ""I think that it's a perfect moment now,"" Green said. ""I think there's a whole perfect storm happening for companies like ours."" For older Web users, he said, the fear was always that someone was tracking them online and could do something harmful with the information. Now, more often than not, users resent the fact that billions of dollars are being made on information they're giving away for free. ""It's not even about the money any more,"" he said. ""It's about the principle. I think that's the emotional vein that people are tapped into right now.""","New companies seek to help Web users take better control of their personal data .
One company, Personal, says users could one day trade data for perks, cash .
Singly offers data lockers that developers will use for personalized apps .

"Baghdad (CNN) -- The angry mobs barged into the newspaper buildings, in the heart of bustling Baghdad. They smashed equipment, stole files, beat up guards and workers, and tossed one person from a roof. The assaults, which unfolded simultaneously Monday, apparently stemmed from outrage over a story seen as critical toward a Shiite cleric in Karbala. Police investigated the incidents on Tuesday. The U.N. mission in Iraq slammed the assaults as ""unacceptable under any circumstances."" UNESCO in Iraq stressed concern over the impact of the attacks. ""Freedom of expression is a crucial element for establishing true democracy and building sustainable peace in Iraq,"" UNESCO Director in Iraq Louise Haxthausen said. Before the attacks, Younis al-Arraf, editor of the Parliament, said he met with angry followers of Mahmud al-Sarkhi, a firebrand Shiite cleric, according to the Journalistic Freedom Observatory (JFO), an Iraqi media watchdog. They discussed a piece in the Parliament suggesting the cleric is planning to take over the Shiite religious authority in Karbala by force. The article also said the al-Sarkhi's residence in Karbala, in the Shiite heartland of southern Iraq, resembles an armed camp, with the location protected by dozens of followers armed with sticks and knives. Al-Arraf said he explained to the people incensed with the article that it was written by a news agency, not produced by the paper itself. But later, attackers entered the buildings of four independent dailies in Iraq's capital -- the Constitution, the Iraqi Future, the People and the Parliament, the observatory said. At least six people were injured, police said. Employees of a fifth Baghdad daily newspaper, al-Mada, received threats on Tuesday, the paper's director general told CNN. Mada means ""range"" in Arabic. A spokesman for the cleric said his office had nothing to do with the attacks and condemned them. The JFO condemned the attacks and called on authorities to investigate and protect journalists. After the fall of Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein and and the advent of democracy, a vibrant media scene has emerged in Iraq, with a slew of newspaper and broadcasting outlets independent or affiliated with political movements. But journalism can be a perilous calling in Iraq, one of the most dangerous countries for journalists to practice in since 2003, when the war there began. CNN's Mohammed Tawfeeq reported on this story from Baghdad; CNN's Joe Sterling reported from Atlanta.","A story about Shiite cleric Mahmud al-Sarkhi angered supporters .

"Belfast, Northern Ireland (CNN) -- Audio recordings locked inside a college library in the United States might help solve a decades-old murder mystery, but the release of those tapes could damage the fragile peace in Northern Ireland. In December 1972, the widow Jean McConville was taken from her home in Belfast and her 10 children. ""They came about tea time and they dragged her out of the bathroom and dragged her out,"" remembers McConville's daughter, Helen McKendry, who was then a teenager. Ever since, McKendry has been on a 40-year quest for answers. ""All I ever wanted was to know the reason why they killed my mother,"" McKendry explained. ""I've lived all my life in fear,"" McKendry added. ""They destroyed my mother's life, my family life."" McKendry believes tapes locked away in Boston College's library may hold the truth about her mother's fate. But there are fears that the tapes may also cause embarrassment or worse for Gerry Adams, the prominent Catholic politician who helped broker peace in Northern Ireland. The recordings were made as part of the Belfast Project, which is a collection of interviews conducted with former Northern Irish paramilitary fighters. They provide an oral history of the decades of sectarian fighting that became known as The Troubles. Reminders of Irish 'troubles' rise to surface . Northern Ireland is part of Britain and Protestant fighters wanted to keep it that way. Catholics were fighting to force the British out and reunify the north with the rest of Ireland. The former combatants believed that their recorded interviews would be kept secret until their death. But that may no longer be possible as Northern Irish police are asking the United States government to hand over some of the tapes. The police say they were alerted to the secret archive by the book, ""Voices from the Grave,"" written by Belfast Project archive manager Ed Moloney, which is based on transcripts from two of the recorded interviews. One of those featured is Brendan Hughes, a now-deceased former commander of the Irish Republican Army or IRA, a Catholic paramilitary. Hughes told his interviewer: ""I have never, ever, ever admitted being a member of the IRA, ever. I've just done it here."" And he talked about Jean McConville's murder, stating: ""I knew she was being executed. I knew that. I didn't know she was going to be buried or disappeared as they call them now."" Hughes went on to allege Gerry Adams was involved: ""The special squad was brought into the operation then, called The Unknowns. You know when anyone needed to be taken away they normally done it. I had no control over this squad. Gerry had control over this particular squad."" Hughes added he regretted what happened: ""Looking back on it now, what happened to the woman was wrong."" Hughes said in his taped interview, McConville was killed because the IRA believed she was working with the British army. The McKendrys do not believe she was a spy, saying she was too busy looking after her 10 children to be an informer. Gerry Adams, leader of Northern Ireland's Sinn Fein party, refused to be interviewed by CNN for this story. But, he has said many times before that he was never in the IRA and never involved in the death of Jean McConville, and has labeled as libelous any allegation he was involved in the McConville murder. His spokesman goes further, labeling Adams' critics as anti the peace process. Adams' denial of IRA membership angers his old comrades like Hughes. ""It means that people like myself had to carry the responsibility of all those deaths,"" Hughes said on the interview tape. ""Gerry was a major, major player in the war and yet he's standing there denying it."" The Northern Irish police vow to ""follow the material in the Boston Archives all way to court if that's where it takes them ... they say detectives have a legal responsibility to investigate murders ... and follow all lines of inquiry."" The British government's most senior politician on Northern Ireland, Owen Paterson told CNN that no one person is above the law. ""There can be no concept on amnesty, so we have to support the police to have complete operational independence in pursuing every line of inquiry in bringing those who committed crimes to justice,"" Paterson said. Right now the Boston archive manager, Ed Moloney, is furious with Boston College for initially giving in too quickly to subpoenas demanding they hand over some of the tapes to a U.S. judge. He says it puts lives in danger, damages the future of truth recovery, oral histories and academic research. Moloney -- who is appealing to try to stop the court from handing the tapes it has to police -- wants the tapes handed back to the people who told their stories. ""Boston College is no longer a fit and proper place to keep these interviews,"" Moloney insists. ""The archives should be closed down, and the interviews should be returned to the people who gave them because they're not safe."" But there seems to be little chance of that, Boston College's spokesman Jack Dunn blames Moloney. ""From the beginning, we said to the project organizer, who approached us with this idea, that there were limitations regarding the assurances of confidentiality under American law,"" Dunn said. But what worries Moloney is that if the police get tapes relating to Jean McConville's murder, they could quickly find other crimes to investigate implicating more political leaders and the police could soon demand all the tapes in the archive. Few believe the police will get Adams to court in part because he is inoculated from prosecution by his central role silencing IRA guns and delivering peace, and in part because the tapes alone cannot secure a conviction. Former IRA man Richard O'Rawe recorded a statement for the Boston College archives and says lawyers told him under UK law the tapes cannot be used in court. ""I find it just imponderable, why the police are going down this road when they must know that there is no chance of obtaining any convictions at the end of this,"" O'Rawe says. Like many other Catholics, O'Rawe thinks the police are biased against them, trying to settle old scores and bring Adams and others down. But for Helen McKendry, herself a Catholic getting access to the tapes is about so much more. For her, it's not only about justice but a release from the pain of never knowing the truth. ""They tried to destroy what life I have now,"" she says. ""They are the people who committed the crimes in this. They should be worried.""","Tapes made in secret by former fighters across sectarian divide offer chilling insights .
Now a fight is brewing over whether police can have access to them .
Northern Ireland police and one family think the tapes may help victims of the violence .
Researchers say releasing the tapes puts at risk the lives of those who spoke to them ."
"Madrid, Spain (CNN) -- Sister Maria Gomez is an 87-year-old Catholic nun. This month, she appeared in a Spanish court escorted by police. She is accused of snatching an infant from her birth mother and putting the child up for an illegal adoption in 1982. Sister Maria Gomez flatly refused to testify and was jeered as she stepped outside the court. The elderly nun wearing a gray habit has become the face of what is known in Spain as Ninos Robados or Stolen Children. Thousands of newborn babies -- according to groups working with the now-adult adoptees -- were taken from their mothers, straight out of hospitals, and sold to families desperate for children. At least 2,000 official cases have been filed with Spanish prosecutors, but some believe there could be tens of thousands more, dating as far back as the 1950s and continuing as recently as the 1990s. So far, it seems the cases, from all across Spain, were individuals making money from misery rather than a nationally coordinated network or organized crime gangs. But of all these cases, only one person has been named as a suspect, Sister Maria Gomez. One day after her appearance in court, she issued a statement denying the allegations saying they were deeply disgusting and that she has never known a single case of a newborn being taken from a mother through coercion or threats. We traveled to Spain to talk to those parents who believe their children were stolen and some who believe they were taken from their birth parents. Juan Luis Moreno and Antonio Barroso grew up together as childhood friends. Their parents had different interests and different jobs, but the two families vacationed every year in the city of Zaragoza. Decades later, when both were in their 40s, Moreno's dying father told his son the truth about those summer holidays: Both families were paying annual installments to a Catholic nun. He said the money paid for the illegal adoption of both boys as newborn babies. ""In fact, my dad was given a choice: boy or girl,"" Moreno said. ""They put it bluntly: This was a market for babies."" Moreno said his father told him he had paid roughly double the price of their family home, a huge sum for a working-class family. The truth angered both men so much that they tracked down the nun - not Sister Maria Gomez - who facilitated the illegal adoption and confronted her. At first she denied receiving any payments, but then slowly remembers both of their adopted parents. Barroso said: ""I was so angry and I threatened her: you're going to have problems. You're going to jail. It was the least I could do because I wanted to strangle her."" ""Imagine! She tells you with all the coolness of the world. There were two for the Penedes region. Like we were chickens in the market. Like two kilos of tomatoes. What kind of a twisted mind is this?"" asks Moreno . After that, Barroso set up Anadir, an association for Spain's stolen children. The response has been overwhelming. Hundreds have contacted them in the hopes of finding their lost children or parents. Anadir has set up a database to register the DNA of parents searching for their children. So far, however, only a handful of matches have been made and the odds of families being reunited are slim. Read Juan Luis Moreno's birth certificate which lists the couple who raised him as his birth parents and does not mention any adoption . And his DNA test result which says the couple he knew as his parents could not be his natural parents . Ines Perez and her daughter, Ines Madrigal, have a typically loving mother-daughter relationship but are also caught in the stolen babies scandal. Ines junior is almost a foot taller than her small, stooped mother. She frets about her mother living alone, tidies up her mother's tiny apartment and combs down her mother's white hair. Ines senior is 89 but still has her health, sense of humor and, most importantly, a good memory. She remembers the day Ines Madrigal was born, precisely because she was not there. ""She wasn't adopted, she was given as a present for taking care of a boy. They didn't give me flowers or money. They gave me a baby girl,"" she said. On the day Madrigal was born, she says the head doctor at the maternity clinic, Dr. Eduardo Vela, summoned her for a ""surprise."" When she arrived, she says, he placed a newborn baby in her arms and handed her a falsified birth certificate. The baby was small, born premature, she says. ""The doctor said ""Just put her in the car between two hot water bottles,"" Perez recalls. ""A woman came in with the doctor. She was wearing operating clothes and trying not to show her face. Of course, you realize all this [with] hindsight."" In the conversation that followed Perez remembers the woman saying they shouldn't do anything that would cause other women in the clinic to ""discover the garlic"" -- a local expression for arousing suspicion. Madrid's prosecutor says pursuing a criminal case has its problems. He says a false birth certificate is a crime that can no longer be prosecuted because it happened so long ago and it does not prove a baby has been stolen. In a summary of his testimony to investigators in the case of Ines Madrigal, Vela denies any wrong-doing, saying that he only helped women who wanted to put their children up for adoption, never pressuring any mother to do so. CNN tried contacting Vela but he refused to answer questions. Perez told the story to her daughter when she turned 18. They showed CNN the false birth certificate and the DNA tests that show the two are not related. But now Madrigal wants to know more. Was she simply given up for adoption or was she one of Spain's stolen babies? ""If I wasn't stolen, then where is the signature of my birth mother?"" asks Madrigal. ""I just want to know the truth.""","A nun appears in court on an illegal baby adoption charge that could be the tip of an iceberg .

"(CNN) -- From fighting common colds to cancer, Chinese herbal medicines have long been touted for their healing properties. But this week, environmental group Greenpeace says it found many herbs purchased from Chinese and Hong Kong retail stores contain alarming levels of harmful pesticides. One herb, a sample of San Qi flower purchased from popular chain Beijing Tong Ren Tang, contained over 500 times the EU safety limit of a restricted pesticide. Another herb contained over 100 times that limit, according to the report. Beijing Tong Ren Tang did not return calls for comment. Of the 65 herbs sampled by Greenpeace, 51 contained pesticides with 26 having chemicals classified as ""extremely or highly hazardous"" by the World Health Organization, it said. ""These herbs are of doubtful quality and not safe to consume,"" said Jing Wang, a Greenpeace project leader. The pesticides pose significant risks for consumers and farmers, Greenpeace said. ""We found some old, obsolete pesticides, with highly hazardous chemicals. Even a tiny dose can result in acute toxicity or sickness,"" said Wang. ""Other pesticides can affect our immune system or hormones, and some may have an impact on children's brain development."" This is not the first time China has experienced a pesticide-related food scandal. In 2010, batches of cowpeas in Hainan province tested positive for a highly toxic pesticide, according to state media. Last month, an investigation by China Central Television (CCTV) found that farmers in Shandong province were using ""three to six times"" the recommended level of pesticides on ginger crops. According to Greenpeace, China uses more pesticides than any other country in the world. Wang said the Chinese government has ""no regulation or guidance"" regarding the use of pesticides with herbal crops. ""We want government agencies to strengthen the control, monitoring, and guidance of pesticide use,"" she said. ""The Hong Kong government has more standards than the mainland, but it's still not enough,"" she added. Dr. Stephanie Ma, an expert on pesticides at the University of Hong Kong, said that Hong Kong generally has ""adequate safeguards"" to protect consumers from pesticides in food. ""All pesticides are fully assessed by the regulatory authorities for safe use before registration,"" she said. A Hong Kong law scheduled to take effect in August 2014 will set further limits on pesticide residues in food. Ma said pesticide levels that exceed standards set by the European Union ""do not automatically indicate imminent health risk to consumers."" Conclusions about risks cannot be drawn without taking into account consumers' ""level of intake and consumption frequency,"" she added. In a statement, the Hong Kong Department of Health said, ""The Department of Health (DH) is concerned about the findings released by Greenpeace. DH is requesting Greenpeace to provide us with the full report for detail study. In particular, there is lack of information on the testing methods, testing standards and the testing laboratory which are needed to conduct an appropriate risk assessment."" ""The DH has also in place a market surveillance system to obtain Chinese herbal medicine samples to test the levels of pesticide residues and heavy metals,"" it added. ""So far no abnormal results have been detected from the decocted Chinese medicine samples."" The Chinese Ministry of Health did not respond to requests for comment. Meanwhile, Ma offered a simple piece of advice: ""In general, the level of pesticide residues in a crop commodity will be reduced substantially following washing and processing: boiling in particular.""","Greenpeace: Of 65 herbs tested, 26 contained ""highly hazardous"" pesticides .

"(CNN) -- The past few weeks have seen North Korea become increasingly belligerent toward the United States and South Korea, with Pyongyang threatening to ""mercilessly strike"" its enemies. But does the reclusive nation, led by Kim Jong Un, have the capability to back up its threats? Realistically, who's at risk of attack and where? Most observers say North Korea is years away from having the technology to deliver a nuclear warhead. However, it still has plenty of conventional firepower, including medium-range missiles. North Korea: Our global fear and fascination . Here's a look at some of North Korea's possible targets and whether they might be in range: . South Korea . The two Koreas technically are still at war because their conflict in the 1950s ended in a truce, not a peace treaty. But in March, the North declared that truce invalid. South Korea's close proximity to the north puts it easily within range of the North's missiles -- not to mention the heavy artillery that's built up at the Demilitarized Zone separating the two countries. The North also has a military force of 1.1 million -- nearly double the South Korean military and the 28,000 American troops stationed in the South. Its numbers advantage offsets an aging air force, which has suffered fuel shortages in the past, and a navy that's smaller than South Korea's. People in South Korea's capital don't seem too concerned with the North's latest rhetoric -- they've been hearing it for decades. But it's different on Yeongpyeong Island, a two-hour ferry trip from the South Korean mainland, where people have fresh memories of North Korea's shelling in 2010. Guam . In addition to South Korea, North Korea has threatened to strike U.S. bases in the Pacific, specifically those in Hawaii and Guam. The United States recently announced that it would be sending a land-based missile defense system to Guam, an island in the Western Pacific about 2,000 miles from North Korea, to defend against a possible attack. North Korea says U.S. bases in Guam are in ""striking range,"" but at least one analyst says he's doubtful of a legitimate threat. ""Unless there has been a miraculous turnaround among North Korea's strategic forces, there is little chance that it could successfully land a missile on Guam, Hawaii or anywhere else outside the Korean Peninsula that U.S. forces may be stationed,"" wrote James Hardy, Asia-Pacific editor of IHS Jane's Defence Weekly, in an opinion column for CNN.com. Still, the U.S. is taking no chances. ""It only takes being wrong once, and I don't want to be the secretary of defense who was wrong once,"" U.S. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said. Japan . While there may be some doubt about whether North Korea could strike Guam, the same cannot be said for Japan. Only a few hundred miles separate North Korea and Japan, which also hosts U.S. military bases. With North Korea allegedly transferring missile components to its east coast, Japan faces the threat of a missile hitting its shores or flying over its air. Continental United States . State media in North Korea reported in March that it had rockets on standby, ready to fire at U.S. targets on the mainland. That report came with a photo of Kim featuring a map behind him that appeared to show straight lines stretching to the continental United States. Officials have said they do not believe North Korea has the capability to reach Hawaii, much less the U.S mainland. But the Obama administration nevertheless announced plans to deploy additional ground-based missile interceptors on the West Coast. In a March interview with ABC News, President Barack Obama said he does not think North Korea can carry out a missile attack on the United States. ""They probably can't, but we don't like the margin of error,"" Obama said.","North Korea has threatened pre-emptive strikes against U.S., but how realistic are these threats?
South Korea and Japan, both with U.S. military bases, are well within striking distance .
Experts doubt Guam could be hit, and the U.S. mainland appears to be well out of range ."
"Beijing (CNN) -- Chinese Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi on Tuesday called on the United States to tread carefully on issues related to China's core interests in order to build trust and avoid conflicts. ""In particular, the U.S. side needs to honor its commitments and carefully and properly handle Taiwan- and Tibet-related issues that concern China's core interests,"" Yang said at a news conference held on the sidelines of the Chinese legislature's annual meeting. He also said that China and the United States were in ""close communication"" on the issues of Syria and Iran. Yang said China opposed the development and possession of nuclear weapons by any country in the Middle East, including Iran. ""At the same time,"" he added, ""countries have the right to peaceful use of nuclear energy."" ""The Iran nuclear issue should be resolved through dialogue, not confrontation, through cooperation, not sanctions,"" Yang said. ""We oppose unilateral sanctions and believe the majority in the world agrees with that."" President Barack Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Monday they stood together in their efforts to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon, but Netanyahu warned that time for diplomacy was running short. Yang reiterated China's diplomatic stance on Syria, which has been the subject of international criticism. The minister said China's stance has been ""gaining understanding and support in the international community."" China this week made new diplomatic efforts to help mediate in the Syria conflict, where President Bashar al-Assad's regime has been pursuing a nationwide campaign to crush the nearly year-old protests against his rule. The United Nations says at least 7,500 people have died in the crackdown, while opposition activists put the toll at more than 9,000. Li Huaxin, China's former ambassador to Syria, is visiting the troubled country on Tuesday and Wednesday as a representative of Yang. Li is expected to discuss with Syrian officials China's ""six point statement,"" which was issued this week. The statement calls for respect of Syrian sovereignty, delivery and distribution of humanitarian aid and support for mediation efforts by Kofi Annan, the former U.N. secretary-general who is now special joint envoy to Syria for the United Nations and the Arab League. Yang reiterated China's opposition to unilateral outside intervention. ""People in the Middle East know the situation best and it should be resolved by the people in the Middle East. They should determine their own destiny,"" he said at the news conference Tuesday. Yang said, although there are some differences and disagreements between Beijing and Washington, ""on the whole the Sino-U.S. relationship has been moving forward, not backward."" This year, Obama and top defense officials unveiled a new U.S. defense strategy that focuses heavily on the Asia-Pacific region. Many Asian economies are growing fast, but the region contains numerous potential flashpoints that the administration has identified as crucial to U.S. interests. The strategy calls for the United States to increase its military's ""institutional weight and focus on enhanced presence, power projection, and deterrence in Asia-Pacific,"" said Defense Secretary Leon Panetta. When asked whether Beijing views the strategic shift by the United States in Asia as threatening, the foreign minister replied: ""The two sides should view bilateral ties from a long-term strategic perspective."" ""China and the U.S. have more converging interests in the Asia-Pacific region than anywhere else in the world,"" he said. ""We hope to see and welcome a constructive role by the U.S. in this region, and at the same time we hope that the U.S. side will respect China's interests and concerns."" Those include the issues of Taiwan and Tibet. Beijing considers Taiwan a breakaway province and has never ruled out the use of force to achieve reunification. If China were to use military force, the United States -- which does not support Taiwan independence -- could intervene under the Taiwan Relations Act, a 1979 law declaring that peace and stability in the area are in U.S. interests. That raises fears of a much wider conflict were China to intervene. Taiwan's incumbent President Ma Ying Jeou was re-elected in January. He has fostered warmer ties with China in recent years, providing a lift to Taiwan's economy. China is grappling with unrest and a series of self-immolations among its Tibetan population in western provinces like Sichuan. It has flooded some ethic Tibetan areas with security forces ahead of the anniversary this month of Tibetan protests in 2008 that ended in bloodshed. The United States, which recognizes Tibet as an autonomous region of China, has expressed concern about the situation. Looking ahead, Yang said he saw a trend of peace and development gaining momentum, even as the global community continues to deal with the impact of the international financial crisis. ""The global economy is recovering slowly,"" he said. ""The challenges from climate change, energy and food security remain stark. All these issues will exert major impact on the global situation and on China's diplomacy in the years to come.'","Chinese foreign minister cites Taiwan and Tibet as key issues .

"Hickam Air Force Base, Hawaii (CNN) -- There is a skull here, hundreds of fragments of bones there. Table after table is lined with human remains. One holds a near-complete skeleton, another has hundreds of tiny pieces of bone that could come from many different people. Together, it tells the story of life and death in the military. At the world's largest skeletal identification laboratory more than 30 forensic anthropologists, archaeologists and dentists of Joint POW-MIA Accounting Command are working to put names to the remains. Based at Hickam Air Force Base -- site of the Pearl Harbor attack -- in Honolulu, Hawaii, JPAC is made up of all branches of the U.S. military and civilian scientists, united in the goal of bringing back all 84,000 U.S. service members who went missing during war or military action. The unit researches old war records and combs battle sites and aircraft crash sites in some of the most remote locations around the world. Any recovered remains are brought back to JPAC's Central Identification Laboratory. The mission is to bring answers to families who may have been waiting 60 years or more to hear anything about a loved one. They call it the most honorable mission in the military. ""I've been all over the world from Korea to South Africa, East Asia to South America and then, of course, in Iraq and my job is to defeat the enemy. I am proud of that,"" says Lt. Col. Raul Gonzalez, who works at JPAC managing 18 teams who search for remains. ""This job, though, has been one of the more healing jobs in a sense that instead of doing what I am normally planning on doing and training to do, I'm bringing people back together, bringing families back together, bringing closure and it is truly, deep down inside, one of the most rewarding experiences."" Dr. Robert Mann, a forensic anthropologist at CIL and head of the forensic science academy there. ""The task is daunting. It's incredibly complicated. It goes to the peaks of the Himalayas, it goes to the jungles of Southeast Asia. It goes to the oceans of the Pacific. So from the highest point to the lowest point on the earth, we're looking for missing Americans."" The mission can start in many different ways, possibly a tip from a veteran who remembers where he lost a fellow soldier during a hectic battle, or even from someone finding remains while digging in their yard. Most of the time, investigations begin with a researcher or historian who searches military records known as Individual Deceased Personnel Files. The files include information about where a service member was lost and how that person may have died. It's the researcher's role to figure out if there is enough evidence to search a site. ""We'll look at all the evidence and say is it going to be worth it to actually go to the site?"" explains historian Andrew Speelhoffer. ""And if it is, the next time we're in that country, we'll put that on the list. And we'll go to the site and we'll locate and question any witnesses."" ""I think one of the most interesting parts of my job is just learning these cases individually,"" Speelhoffer says. ""I think one of the things about World War II is just the size of it, just the numbers you're talking about. We're missing upwards of 74,000 Americans. ""When you're dealing with those kinds of numbers, it's really interesting to look at these cases on an individual basis and learn little bits, little tidbits of information about these guys. You know, where they were from, what particular mission they were on, that kind of thing."" Once a site is approved, an investigation team interviews possible witnesses and does a preliminary search of the grounds. If they find enough evidence that remains are present a recovery team is sent back to the site to dig for remains. Recovery sites can be grueling. Wars are often fought far away from the comforts of home, and the recovery teams sometimes camp at a dig site for up to 60 days. The end result -- finding a service member who'd been lost for decades -- makes it all worthwhile. ""I got here in 1992 and about the first five years I was in the jungles,"" Mann says, who with other anthropologists and archaeologists goes on recovery missions as well as working in the lab. ""I went native. I got out there and I didn't want to come back because it was so exciting. It was such an invigorating thing and I felt as though I was doing something really good to bring home these missing Americans. ""Once you do this, you get the bug, you realize what your contribution can be to science, what your contribution can be to the United States. And to these guys and gals who served and gave everything. ""I feel as though this is something that I can give back to those folks who served and to those families who are out there still that are looking for answers. I think it is the most exciting thing anybody could ever do."" Mann has been on digs with veterans who return to the site of terrifying battles to help them figure out where to find lost soldiers. And when remains are brought back to CIL, Mann is one of the anthropologists trying to put a name to the remains -- a very long and intense process. The work begins by identifying sex, age at death, racial or ancestral background, how tall the individual was, and what kind of trauma the person received. Mann explains the process, starting with first knowing where the remains were recovered. ""So you've narrowed it down geographically. Then you end up with say 20 individuals that are missing within a 20-mile radius of where these remains were recovered. ""You've now got it down to 20 individuals. And now the biology, the anthropology is going to say ""well this is a 20-24 year old white male."" You've narrowed it down again. How tall is he? He's about 5'8 to 5'9. And you can see you keep narrowing and narrowing and narrowing it to where you get it down to where the dental says, it is this individual right here."" Dental records, when they're available, are often the key to making a final identification. Lt. Col. Lisa Franklin is a forensic odontologist -- a dentist who compares dental remains to dental records to make an identification. ""If a body is found and there are different types of dental restorations in the mouth -- say a metal crown, maybe a white filling, a composite filling or a resin filling -- those are very unique things in individual mouths and it sets them apart from somebody else who does not have those things in their teeth. So the dental profile can be very unique to one individual."" But not all remains include the jaw or teeth, which is why the scientists at CIL are constantly looking for new technology. Another identification technique is comparing mitochondrial DNA found in bones -- not the same type that can be extracted through saliva or blood -- to DNA extracted from a maternal lineage. The scientists are also testing out a new way to use the old method of photo superimposition. Using two cameras -- one on a photograph, the other on a skull -- they are trying to determine the accuracy of layering a photo over a skull to make identifications. It is a mission this unit says it will never tire of. ""Technology changes, technology evolves and gets better,"" says Mann. ""So what we can't do today with this one little piece of bone, we might be able to do tomorrow with DNA. ""And we're going to keep searching, we're going to keep trying, and we're not going to give up on these guys and gals who are missing.""","Scientists and historians, military and civilians aim to recover all missing U.S. service personnel .

"(CNN) -- A Michigan congressman said Sunday that relatives are trying to blackmail him with decades-old allegations that he sexually abused a young cousin, an accusation he called ""false and shameful."" Rep. Dale Kildee, a Democrat who has held his Flint-area district since 1976, said he once went to the FBI after one relative threatened to go public with the claims if he didn't get federal benefits for the cousin, now an adult with a history of mental illness. Kildee, 82, announced in July that he would retire at the end of his current term. His nephew Dan Kildee is running for the seat. Family members recounted the claims -- which Kildee said date back 50 years -- in audio recordings posted online and published by The Washington Times. ""Republicans tried to peddle these scurrilous allegations during my last congressional race and authorities and reputable news outlets rejected these false allegations,"" Kildee said in a statement issued Sunday night. ""Now they are back at it again to try to win an open congressional seat."" Attempts to contact the congressman's office were unsuccessful Sunday night. But in video posted on the Washington Times' website, Kildee said there's ""no shred of truth"" to the accusation. ""I'm going to respond and let people judge,"" he added. The Washington Times reported the interview was conducted by Jon Yinger, a Michigan religious broadcaster. In it, one of Kildee's relatives said she is coming forward because the man ""will never speak for himself."" ""I am doing what I prayed he could do, but he's not,"" she says. But the woman also says the man's wife once called Kildee's office to try to get federal benefits for her husband. ""She was blackballing, or blackmailing, Dale with this information, so it wasn't a comfortable situation,"" the relative recounts during the interview. ""She basically went to him and said, 'You're going to get me his Social Security disability or I'm going to go public with that.' "" Kildee highlighted that portion of the recording in his press release, saying it had occurred 20 years ago. He also released a copy of what he said was the last letter he had received from the cousin, in 1988, in which the man asks for Kildee's help in establishing a ""global telethon"" to end hunger in Africa. The letter is signed, ""With all my love.""","Rep. Dale Kildee is retiring from Congress after 18 terms .

State security prosecutors will investigate the case before the suspects are brought to trial, it said. All seven are of ""Arab nationalities,"" WAM reported.

"San Jose, California (CNN) -- At 17 years old, Jessica Perez is an honor student who aspires to be the first member of her family to graduate from college. But when it came to the application process, she felt lost, alone and ill-prepared. ""I didn't really know where to start,"" said Perez, who wants to be an astrophysicist. ""There wasn't really anybody at home that could help me figure out how I could reach my dream."" Perez's grandparents, who raise Perez and her two siblings, both work long hours to make ends meet. And neither continued their education beyond elementary school. Fortunately for Perez, she was directed by her school guidance counselor to a nonprofit called Strive for College. ""It helps students who don't really know anything about the college process,"" she said. ""College students come to you and they tell you how to do it because they've been through it also."" Strive for College pairs high-school students with college students for free, one-on-one consultation over a yearlong period. Each pair works together through the application process for colleges, scholarships and financial aid. ""We take them through every little step of the process, because, frankly, it's a pretty detailed process -- and if you miss one step, you could ruin all your chances,"" said Michael Carter, who founded the nonprofit in 2007 while he was a college freshman. So far, Strive for College has already helped 600 low-income students across the country enter four-year colleges and universities. And it expects to help an additional 900 this year. Carter grew up in an upper-middle-class suburb of San Jose, California. He attended private school throughout his early childhood, and he remembers his grandfather calling him a ""menso"" -- basically translated to ""moron"" in Spanish -- for claiming everyone in the United States got an equal shot at success. That pessimism started to make more sense to Carter when he transferred to a public high school in his junior year. ""Going to private schools, a lot of students who didn't do amazingly academically knew they were going to a four-year college because their parents had gone. It was just a given,"" said Carter, 24. ""Whereas a lot of students at my public school, even if they had great GPAs and SATs, they didn't know if they could go to a four-year college. It was just very foreign to a lot of them."" It didn't help that there were two guidance counselors for roughly 1,600 students. They just couldn't devote themselves to students who failed to approach them about college -- the very students who Carter felt needed this help the most. ""This made me realize that my grandpa was right, I was a menso,"" Carter said. ""And it made me firmly believe that this was a problem that was solvable."" Carter designed a pilot study during his freshman year at Washington University in St. Louis. Pairing his classmates with low-income high school students at a nearby high school, he hoped to prove that college acceptance rates could be dramatically changed. The pilot's success was astounding: 24 of the 27 seniors in the study were accepted into four-year colleges. In the previous year, the school's acceptance rate was only 1 out of every 30 seniors. ""At first it was like, 'Wow, look at this amazing miracle that happened,' "" Carter said. ""But I quickly couldn't sleep at night thinking how many of the (students) the year before had earned the right to go (to college) and just no one helped them across the finish line."" Carter found that his study was indicative of a more widespread problem in the United States. ""There's over 400,000 low-income high school seniors every year who (are) qualified to go to a four-year college, and for whatever reason they just don't go,"" Carter said. And the difference between going to college and not going to college can often mean limited career opportunities or growth. Over a 40-year career, college graduates on average make nearly $1 million more than someone with only a high school degree, according to the U.S. Census (PDF). ""When my first (mentee) called me and said, 'I got into my first college. You helped changed my life,' I started crying,"" Carter said. ""I was like, 'I think I really did help change your life.' And it was just an amazing feeling."" Do you know a hero? Nominations are open for 2013 CNN Heroes . With the help of high-school administrators, Strive for College targets youth who attend schools where 50% or more of the students are eligible to receive free or reduced lunch. To participate, students must have a GPA of at least 2.0. Interested students fill out a questionnaire about their academic and financial histories as well as their interests, abilities and ambitions. Then they can attend a ""speed-dating-style"" session in which they choose their college student mentor. Throughout the school year, pairs meet at the high school once a week for an hour. The process takes the students through each step: selecting their target schools, filling out applications, writing essays, obtaining letters of recommendation, targeting scholarships and financial aid, reporting test scores and completing entrance exams. ""As a mentor, your role can be coach, pseudo-parent, cheerleader,"" Carter said. ""But it's that amazing near-peer connection of young people with young people ... helping them through a process you just went through yourself, and taking the mystery and anxiety out of it, that I think is really important."" Strive for College also aims to help students graduate with the least amount of student loan debt possible, ensuring stronger graduation rates and enhancing the college experience. With scholarships and financial aid, 40% of Strive students attend four-year colleges without having to come out of pocket for their tuition -- compared with 32% of low-income college students nationwide. Beginning this spring, mentors and mentees will be able to communicate and track progress over the interactive ""UStrive"" community website. The social network will allow students to track the curriculum's calendar and see when their peers complete major steps in the application process. Participants can make suggestions and bookmark items of interest for others. Carter has found that the social component helps students stay on track with their goals. ""It creates peer pressure, but of a rare, positive kind. As they see one another looking at great universities and trying to aim for great financial aid packages, then their peers, their friends also say, 'If you can do that, I can, too.' And they start to raise their goals,"" he said. ""It's a really powerful process in which you're building a culture of achievement in the schools."" It's a culture that helped Shanna Brancato raise her own academic ambitions. The former foster child had never considered college as part of her future when she was encouraged to attend her first Strive for College session in her junior year of high school. ""I've never really thought of myself as the greatest student. College was not on my mind,"" she said. ""Now I'm a sophomore at San Jose State University. My full tuition is covered, and I'm mentoring a high school student."" Many former mentees, like Brancato, become Strive for College mentors. ""It's that 'paying it forward' mentality that is building a Strive movement that will solve this problem, I think, within the next decade,"" Carter said. Carter graduated from college in 2010 and has devoted himself full-time to his nonprofit. Strive for College now has 12 university chapters working in 15 high schools nationwide, and it is planning to launch eight more chapters this year. ""The more we grow, the more students we help, the greater our impact, the bigger our movement,"" Carter said. ""We'll go from changing hundreds to thousands of lives, to changing hundreds of thousands, and some day soon, even millions. ""I'm so sure this will happen, because I believe in our generation. I know our mentors. I know the students we serve. And I know that together we are going to solve this problem."" Want to get involved?

"Laguna Niguel, California (CNN) -- Twitter did not participate in the recent online ""blackouts,"" in which Wikipedia and others made their websites inaccessible to U.S. visitors for a day, because it would have been counterproductive, the company's CEO said Monday night. ""You don't pull the batteries out of the microphone,"" Dick Costolo told audience members during an onstage interview at News Corp.'s D: Dive Into Media conference here. Instead, Twitter proved to be a key platform for people exchanging information about the controversial Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA) and similar proposed legislation, Costolo said. About 3.9 million messages about SOPA and its sister bill, PIPA, were posted to Twitter on January 18, the day of the blackout, he said. After a huge outcry online, both bills have since been shelved. Addressing the new censorship policy that Twitter announced last week to much outrage and confusion, Costolo maintained that his company has taken the right approach. He repeatedly said that scholars would one day determine that Twitter had made the right move. ""I think it's a super-complex issue,"" Costolo said. ""It takes a while for the scholars and the people who have studied these issues to chime in."" Twitter's new rule, which many felt was poorly explained when it was introduced, would allow the company to remove a tweet according to the law in one country while having it remain visible for people in other countries. Previously, the tweet would disappear for everyone. This isn't just for countries with strict censorship rules and human-rights issues. It applies to tweets in the U.S. that are removed as a result of copyright takedown notices, Costolo noted. ""It is simply not the case that you can operate in these countries and choose which laws you want to abide by,"" Costolo said. ""There's been no change in our stance or attitude or policy with respect to content on Twitter."" The first topic of the interview involved Twitter's battle with Google regarding the latter seeming to favor its own social network in search results over its rivals'. Google has been under some pressure in Washington recently over charges of anti-competitive practices. Once a Google engineer after the search giant acquired his company FeedBurner, Costolo suggested that Google may have lost its moral compass. ""They've always been a mission-driven company,"" he said. Costolo offered no clear explanation about why Twitter, which now has some 900 employees and more than 100 million active users, and Google could not come to an agreement over including tweets in Google search results. Google indexes 1,300 of Twitter's pages every second, he said. ""I think they have the data they need,"" he said. Toward the end of the interview, Costolo found time to discuss the 2012 presidential campaign, in which Twitter has played an active role. Candidates can mold their public perception through a successful Twitter persona, he said. ""Gosh, I really think 2012 is going to be the Twitter election,"" he said. The corny ""spilled milk"" joke that fell flat in President Barack Obama's State of the Union address was instantly panned on Twitter, reactions people could analyze in real time, Costolo noted. And Costolo should know something about a well-timed joke: He was previously an improvisational comedian in Chicago. Costolo won the audience over by sprinkling deadpan gags and self-deprecating humor into the pre-dinner interview. ""Look, I took an Ambien backstage, so we've got about seven minutes,"" he said at the outset. Costolo joked that his and the interviewer's faces were ""a little too close."" He later told the interviewer, ""First of all, you have a very soothing voice. I'm picking up on that."" He poked fun at the big red ""dental chair"" that the All Things Digital organizers plop every interviewee into at each conference. After making an insightful observation, he told the interviewer, ""You like that? You swiveled in your chair a little bit."" If he had been a political candidate, Costolo likely would have passed the ""Would I want to get a beer with this guy?"" test that has been informally applied as a measure of a candidate's likeability.","Dick Costolo weighs in on Stop Online Piracy Act and Protect Intellectual Property Act .
