"A teacher went to see The Imitation Game at the cinema - only to discover her father had helped Alan Turing break the Enigma Code. Primary school teacher Jane Smith, 54, of St Andrews, Fife, went to see the film, starring Benedict Cumberbatch, knowing her father John Harrison had been involved in code breaking during the war. But she was unaware that the mathematician, who rarely spoke of his wartime service, was part of the exclusive team whose heroic exploits inspired the film. Scroll down for video . Proud legacy: Jane Smith, who watched the movie The Imitation Game, and realised that her father John Harrison (pictured), was one of the characters and worked at Bletchley Park alongside Alan Turing . Mr Harrison, who died in 2012, was head-hunted to join the code-breaking team while he was an economics student at Cambridge University. At the time, in the early 1940s, Britain was losing the Battle of the Atlantic and was on the verge of being invaded  by Germany. Geniuses were needed to crack the highly cryptic code Germans used to communicate with their U-boat submarines. He was among a team recruited to work with the genius Alan Turing at Bletchley Park HQ in Buckinghamshire. Turing's top-secret work with cryptologists and math wizards at Britain's decryption centre saved countless lives by breaking Germany's Enigma machine code. Pioneer: Alan Turing, whose work was instrumental in cracking the Enigma Code . But the computer pioneer received no credit, died a broken man, and was only pardoned for charges of homosexuality, a crime in 1952, 60 years after his death in 1954. The codebreakers were bound by the official secrets act and forbidden to utter a word of their mission. True to his word, her father kept most of his work secret until his death, aged 90. He only mentioned brief details to Jane, her two brothers and her sister. 'He said he had been recruited after one of his university lecturers asked him to quickly complete a tough newspaper crossword,' Mrs Smith said. 'But we didn't know for years how valuable his wartime work was. 'More details only emerged in 2008 when I asked him to speak to some of my primary seven pupils about his experiences. 'I was teaching the children how to gather impartial evidence from people who had lived or witnessed historical events. 'However, dad told me he wouldn't have had much to say about the war except he went to work at Bletchley Park in a suit and carried a briefcase every day and he'd been drafted into it after solving a crossword. The talk to pupils never happened.' Mrs Smith did not recognise the significance of his words until she went to see hit film The Imitation Game. 'It was only when I watched the film with my husband, Blair, last week that the final pieces of the jigsaw fell into place and we truly realised dad's contribution to the war,' she adds. 'No one would ever have known or guessed his part in the Alan Turing story because dad was never one to boast or push himself forward. John Harrison pictured left shortly after the end of the Second World War and on his wedding day in 1959 (right) worked at Bletchley Park alongside Alan Turing but his family are not sure who he is in the film . 'This was so typical of him and his loyalty to his country. 'Now the story is unfolding, we are prouder than ever of his contribution.' Mrs Smith said she is not sure if her father features as a particular character. She added: 'One of the characters in the film, who appears quiet and in the background could be him. He didn't push himself forward which would have been in-keeping with my father's personality. We are not sure though as they changed the names of the other characters in the background. 'I imagine not much would have been known about him but someone who worked with him could have given the information. He took the responsibility of the Official Secrets Act very seriously. The film fleshed out what little we knew about his role in what happened.' Mrs Smith and her family were thrilled when her father was awarded a medal for his code-breaking in 2010. 'It was wonderful for dad to be recognised for his contribution,' Jane said. Cracked: Keira Knightley, from left, Matthew Beard, Matthew Goode, Benedict Cumberbatch, seated, and Allen Leech appear in a scene from 'The Imitation Game' One of the mother's  favourite possessions is a photograph she has of her dad completing a crossword while holding her daughter Beth, 21, when she was only four months old. 'His love of puzzles lasted till a few months before his death and dad was as sharp as a tack to the end.' John spent most of his life working in London as an accountant for the Scottish firm, Thomson McLintock, which evolved into KPMG. On retiring he returned to his home town of St Andrews with his wife, Morag, an artist. He also loved golf, at one time playing off a handicap of scratch, and was a member of the Royal and Ancient golf club. The club flag flew at half-mast the day he died and also on the day of his funeral. Like many of his generation Mr Harrison was a man who never basked in the glory of his wartime effort but moved on quietly with his life when the job was done. 'To work with Alan Turing must have been hugely stressful, but the project must have been ultimately rewarding,' Jane added.","Jane Smith knew her father worked on codes during Second World War .

"The Ministry of Defence has told soldiers to take a month off work over the festive period - in order to cut heating and lighting bills at army barracks. Military chiefs have reportedly instructed personnel heading home for the holidays on Friday to not return until January 5, and in some cases longer. The move is understood to be a cost-saving measure in response to defence cuts. Many of the UK's bases have older buildings and thus inefficient to heat. The Ministry of Defence has told soldiers to take a month off work over the festive period - in order to cut heating and lighting bills at army barracks. File picture . About 100 barracks will have minimal staff over Christmas to provide security and other essential services. A military source told the Daily Telegraph the Army had 'encouraged' commanders to give soldiers an extra week off, although they admit many soldiers may have extra holiday remaining following the withdrawal from Afghanistan. The MoD says no official order was given to close the bases, but did not deny that the extra week was effectively being taken by thousands of soldiers, as well as Navy, RAF and civilian workers. Col Richard Kemp, a former commander of British forces in Afghanistan, told the newspaper: 'This really does send out a message about the parlous state of our finances at the moment.' Vernon Coaker, Labour's shadow defence secretary, said: 'It smacks of a decision made on the hoof with no hint of any strategy to save costs in the long term.' The move is understood to be a cost-saving measure in response to defence cuts. Many of the UK's bases are older buildings and thus inefficient to heat. Pictured, soldiers at Redford Barracks in Edinburgh . Last month Britain's top military officer General Sir Nicholas Houghton said areas of the Ministry of Defence budget are likely to come under pressure in a new round of spending cuts after the general election, whoever is in power. Sir Nicholas also told the BBC's Andrew Marr programme there had been some 'early glitches' in the attempt to recruit 30,000 Army reservists to plug the gap left by cuts to regular troops. The government wants to expand the Army Reserve to 30,000 by 2018, to offset cuts of 20,000 in full-time manpower. But an Army spokesman told MailOnline: ‘It is totally wrong to suggest that the Army is shutting down over Christmas with skeleton staff. ‘Leave periods are at the discretion of local commanders and many units are allowing personnel an extra week over the Christmas period to offset accumulated leave following busy operational commitments. ‘However, all Army bases will continue to be manned appropriately and security levels will always be maintained.’","Extra holiday is to allow military to slash bills, it has been reported .

"Shrien Dewani could sue South African authorities for attempting to use his sexuality as evidence against him, a lawyer said today. In their bungled prosecution, state lawyers tried to argue that his liaisons with gay prostitutes revealed a possible motive for wanting his wife murdered as a 'way out' of the marriage. The move apparently prompted Dewani to reveal on day one of the trial – via a written explanation of his not guilty pleas – intimate details of his private life in a bid to negate the claims. It paved the way for his defence team to call for their client's sexuality to be deemed irrelevant to his murder trial - and Judge Jeanette Traverso duly agreed, angrily throwing out their submissions on more than once occasion. South African lawyer Peter Jordi said Dewani could seek damages if he can show prosecutors had unjustifiably used his sexuality as evidence. He told MailOnline: 'He could have a case for malicious prosecution. Shrien Dewani could sue South African authorities for attempting to use his sexuality as evidence against him, including intimate details of sex sessions with gay prostitute Leopold Leisser (right) 'Defendants can recover expenses for the harm they have suffered and infringement of rights of personality suffered by being falsely prosecuted. ‘They can make a claim where the prosecution brings up material they know is inadmissible to blacken the character of the accused.' Mr Jordi, an attorney at the University of Witwaterstand's law clinic who specialises in claims against the police, said there have been defamation cases against witnesses in the past even when they had told the truth in court. 'If an advocate made a defamatory statement during the course of the proceedings, which was not relevant to the proceedings, then equally the advocate could be held liable,’ he added. 'It is not enough that the information published is truthful. It must be in the interest of the public to receive the information.' State lawyers tried to argue that his liaisons with gay prostitutes revealed a possible motive for wanting his wife Anni (pictured) murdered as a 'way out' of the marriage . The prosecution had lined up a number of witnesses to testify to Dewani's homosexuality, including Leopold Leisser, known as the German Master, and a detective from Scotland Yard who retrieved a bundle of sexually-explicit e-mails between Dewani and an older man. But Judge Traverso furiously accused the prosecution of presenting 'irrelevant' evidence when Leisser took the stand to detail sex sessions he and Dewani had in the months leading up to the honeymoon murder. The allegation that Dewani had told the Birmingham-based escort – who specialises in fetishism and role play - that he needed 'to find a way out' of his engagement to Anni and other conversations they'd shared, was not allowed to be shared with the court, the judge ruled. Prosecutor Adrian Mopp attempted to argue that since Dewani had consistently described himself as a gay man seeking other gay partners on 'hook-up' websites such as Gaydar and Recon, the court should hear more about his conflicted feelings towards hew new bride. 'Premier gay dating site': Dewani logged on to hook-up website Gaydar (above) on October 15, 2010, as he prepared for his £200,000 wedding in Mumbai later that month, Mr Leisser alleged . For men into leather, rubber and kink: Leisser also set up a profile on Recon (above) under the name GermanMaster1, where he offered 'escort services' with emphasis on 'fetish, sadomasochism and role-play' Judge Jeanette Traverso disagreed and ruled that the e-mails were inadmissible as was the vast majority of what Leopold Leisser was prepared to say. She also ruled out as hearsay much of the testimony from Sneha Mashru, Anni’s first cousin, who had been asked to testify about how Anni felt sexually rejected by him. However, Mr Jordi said Dewani's chances of a successful claim were slim. 'I would not be prepared to represent him because my advice would be that he has got a weak case. 'It is harder to prove because the onus is on the defendant to show it was malicious. 'In the particular case in question, it seems that the material may have been relevant (it was brought up in the plea explanation by the accused, for example). 'The claimant should be wary of launching proceedings.' Mannie Witz, a senior defence barrister who specialises in murder cases, said Dewani would face another dilemma if he decided to sue as it would force him into the witness box. He told MailOnline: 'In such a claim, the onus would be on Dewani to prove that the case against him was malicious, meaning he could not avoid giving evidence under oath. 'He simply couldn't do that, judging by the various versions he has given police over time and now to the court in his plea explanation, he is likely to make a shocking witness. 'No lawyer acting for him would advise him to do that.'","Care home owner could have a case against South African prosecutors .

"The recent high-profile abandonment of two babies has prompted the NSW government to crackdown on mothers who try to hide the birth of their child and fail to register it. Attorney General Brad Hazzard has called on police, health and welfare officials to fix holes in the current system that allow for the birth of babies to go unregistered, the Daily Telegraph reports. It comes after a baby boy was found alive in a drain at Quakers Hill in Sydney's west on November 23 and the body of a baby girl was found buried in the sand at Maroubra on November 30. Scroll down for video . The NSW government will crackdown on mothers who try to hide the birth of their child following two high-profile abandonment cases, including this baby boy who was found in a drain in western Sydney . Under current laws, hospitals are required to notify the Registry of Births Deaths and Marriages within seven days of a child's birth and the parents have 60 days to notify authorities. Mr Hazzard said the new taskforce was about ensuring no child remained unregistered in NSW. 'The aim of the working party is to develop a consistent policy to improve the way we respond when a baby is born and not registered within 60 days,' a spokeswoman for Mr Hazzard said yesterday. 'Over experience is the overwhelming majority of parents are registering their babies within 60 days.' Attorney General Brad Hazzard has called on police, health and welfare officials to fix holes in the current system that allow for the birth of babies to go unregistered . The mother of the baby boy dumped in the drain has since been arrested and charged with attempted murder after giving birth at Blacktown Hospital . The taskforce, which is in the process of being set up, will include the Department of Justice, NSW Police, the health department, Family and Community Services and the Ombudsman's Office. The Registry of Births Deaths and Marriages has technology to match hospital notifications of births with that of the parents, but it won't be up and running until the beginning of next year. Emails, letters and telephone calls are currently used by the registry to contact parents of babies who haven't yet been registered. The body of a baby girl was found buried in the sand at Maroubra on November 30 just a week after the case in western Sydney . Police efforts to locate the parents of the girl found dead at Maroubra have so far found nothing, with hospitals unable to provide information about the birth . If the registry can't contact the parents, Family and Community Services are then called in. The mother of the baby boy dumped in the drain has since been arrested and charged with attempted murder after giving birth at Blacktown Hospital. But police efforts to locate the parents of the girl found dead at Maroubra have so far found nothing, with hospitals in the area unable to provide information about the birth.

"Fresh details have emerged about last month's sickening filmed beheading of 22 Syrian soldiers by a group of international killers fighting for the Islamic State. Operational details, such as the expense of the professionally produced and edited footage, how long the film took to shoot, and exactly where it was filmed were uncovered by British and American researchers who spent weeks extracting clues from the 16-minute long video clip. The propaganda video, titled 'Though the Unbelievers Despise It', was known to have been filmed in the religiously symbolic town of Dabiq in North West Syria, and also showed the severed head of captive American aid worker Peter Kassig, who was apparently murdered off screen. However, experts from TRAC (Terrorism Research & Analysis Consortium) and UK-based counter-extremism think tank Quilliam believe they have now pinpointed they exact stretch of desert in which the savage murders took place. They also raise a number of questions about why non-speaking militants are seen wearing microphones, why some militants are filmed at the start of the video but not later, and bring to light new evidence suggesting ISIS' killer-in-chief 'Jihadi John' may have been played by a body double. Scroll down for video . Investment in terror: Experts believe the 16-minute long video would have cost ISIS approximately $200,000 to produce, such was the sophistication of the editing equipment required and the quality of the multiple HD cameras needed to produce such a slick and professional piece of propaganda . Horror: New evidence suggests ISIS' killer-in-chief 'Jihadi John' may have been played by a body double . How the video was shot . According to joint research carried out by TRAC and Quilliam and published by CNN, events leading to ISIS' horrific beheading of 22 Syrian soldiers were filmed over a four to six hour period. Close analysis of shadows and the direction of sunlight suggests that scenes that appear to have been shot without pause were in fact broken up and filmed over a number of hours. This is likely to have been in order to re-shoot scenes if, for example, one of the murderers made a mistake in the heavily choreographed sequences captured before the murders actually take place. The experts believe the 16-minute long video would have cost ISIS approximately $200,000 to produce, such was the sophistication of the editing equipment required and the quality of the multiple HD cameras needed to produce such a slick and professional piece of propaganda. Despite the money spent, basic continuity errors have crept into the film - including militants and prisoners standing in a different order in apparently successive scenes. The frame-by-frame analysis also revealed several moments where ISIS militants are seen in the background of the clip standing around and talking - apparently killing time before being called to take part in group filming. Belgian: Although friends and neighbours say this man is Abdelmajid Gharmaoui - a 28-year-old notorious Belgian Muslim extremist from the town of Vilvoorde - his identity has not been formally confirmed . Mystery: In fact the mayor of Vilvorde, the town where Gharmaoui lived before travelling to Syria in 2012, said Gharmaoui 'is not at all in the video', adding that claims to the contrary are 'completely wrong' Mystery still surrounds identity of killers . Other than the killer known only as Jihadi John, all of the ISIS militants who appear in the murder video are seen with their faces uncovered, making no attempt whatsoever to conceal their identity. Despite this, only one of the terrorists featured has been formally identified - 22-year-old Frenchman Maxime Hauchard, who friends described as a mild-mannered former Catholic who used to sell scooter parts in Normandy until his conversion to Islam at the age of 17. Although the names of a second Frenchman, Michael Dos Santos, and Belgian national Abdelmajid Gharmaoui have been put forward as other suspected executioners, official confirmation has not been given by either government. In fact the mayor of Vilvorde, the town where Gharmaoui lived before travelling to Syria in 2012, said Gharmaoui 'is not at all in the video', adding that claims to the contrary are 'completely wrong'. 'We don't recognise anyone from Vilvoorde in it,' Hans Bonte said. 'I can be sure 99 per cent that no-one from Vilvoorde is in it,' he added. Another name put forward as a suspect was Cardiff medical student turned Islamic State militant Nasser Muthana, 20. However video experts ruled that although the man in the clip resembles Muthana, there are subtle facial differences that suggest they are not the same person. Meanwhile Kurdish sources familiar with the movement of ISIS militants in Syria and Iraq also identified one of the men as a Filipino national. Since the release of the footage, analysts from Britain, France, Germany, the U.S., the Middle East, Asia, Australia and New Zealand have been poring over the footage to try and put names to faces. Unconfirmed: Although the name of a second Frenchman, Michael Dos Santos, have been put forward for this Islamic State executioner, official confirmation has not been given by the French government . Callous: Kurdish sources familiar with the movement of ISIS militants in Syria and Iraq identified this unnamed killer from the latest ISIS beheading video as a Filipino national . Was Jihadi John played by a body double? Within minutes of the Syrian soldier murder video being released, experts began questioning whether the 'Jihadi John' who appears in the footage is the same person as the militant who savagely cut off the head of American journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff and British aid workers David Haines and Alan Henning. These questions were largely raised by reports that the militant had been seriously injured or perhaps even killed by an American airstrike only days before the footage was shot. Viewers pointed to the fact the militant looked slightly shorter than in other beheading videos, and appeared to have put on weight - leaving him with a slight paunch that was not previously visible. However TRAC and Quilliam's research has suggested another clue backing up the claims that more than one person may be 'playing' the role of Jihadi John . In one split-second scene, the experts have identified a second man wearing Jihadi John's distinctive black mask and matching uniform standing in the background of a sequence in which ISIS' executioner in chief is also clearly pictured. One theory is that, with the terror group's leadership the prime target for American-led coalition drone and airstrikes, several men may be pretending to be the militant in the hope of creating a few moments of confusion that could help save the real Jihadi John's life. In the sickening video a group of Syrian soldiers are marched to their execution site by Islamic State militants . Where the murders took place: The location of the killings has been confirmed as a desert road in northern Dabiq that was previously identified in this image from activist group Raqqa is Being Slaughtered Silently . Location of video identified as desert road in northern Dabiq . The Syrian soldier murder video titled 'Though the Unbelievers Despise It' was released through official Islamic State media tagged with a note claiming the video was shot in the town of Dabiq. Now the exact location has been confirmed as the same stretch of desert running parallel to a road in the north of the town that had previously been identified as the location by anti-ISIS activist group Raqqa is Being Slaughtered Silently. The resistance group produced a map to show the location in the northern suburbs of the small but highly symbolic Syrian town of Dabiq, north of Aleppo. The terror group's de facto capital is Raqqa, where previous filmed murders featuring the militant known as 'Jihadi John' are understood to have been filmed. The ISIS video featuring the brutal filmed murder of Syrian soldiers was shot in Dabiq - an area of increasing symbolic importance to Islamic State terrorists. As well as naming their English-language propaganda magazine after the small desert village, a 1,300 year old prophecy predicting Dabiq as the location of an apocalyptic battle between Muslims and an 'infidel horde' is understood to be fueling the warped imaginations of the fanatics. The town, which is in Aleppo province, was captured from the Free Syrian Army in August and prompted streams of highly romanticized propaganda in which ISIS militants identified it as the first step towards ushering in the Apocalypse. A key feature of this prophecy involves attracting the 'infidel horde' into Dabiq for a huge ground battle. ISIS has even named its official magazine, which reinforces its extremist views, 'Dabiq' (two editions above) It is notable that in the latest sickening video, the militant known as Jihadi John is now urging Britain and America to send their troops to fight in Syria, rather than to leave the Islamic State alone as he had done in previous videos. 'Here we are - burying the first American crusader in Dabiq... Eagerly waiting for the remainder of your armies to arrive,' he says. The 1,300-year-old hadith, which is a report of the deeds, teachings and sayings of the Prophet Mohammed, refers to the 'horde' flying 80 banners as they take on a Muslim army in the Syrian town of Dabiq. It warns of a 'malahim' - the equivalent to Armageddon in Christian teachings – in which the Muslims ultimately prevail. ISIS supporters on social media have started comparing recent developments in Syria to the prophecy amid warnings the 'malahim' is coming. Islamic State fighters are said to have drawn on the prophecy even more so since conquering Dabiq in August and the town's name has become a byword for the struggle against the West. The terrorist group has even named its official magazine 'Dabiq', in which it pushes its extremist views and reports victories. Supporters appear to be convinced of the prophecy's validity, with one writing on Twitter: 'Dabiq will happen for certain... The U.S. and its allies will descend on Syria once they see that the air campaign has failed. That is a promise by God and his Messenger.' Another, from Tunisia, wrote. 'The lions of Islam have raised the banner of the Caliphate in Dabiq. Now they await the arrival of the Crusader army.' Shadi Hamid, a fellow at the Brookings Institute, said the hadith is heavily relied upon by ISIS because it 'raises morale'. He said: 'It is fair to assume that the vast majority of (ISIS) fighters believe in this type of talk.'","Researchers spent weeks analysing beheading video in minute detail .

"UKIP will inflict much more damage on the Conservatives than Labour in next year’s general election, increasing the chances of Ed Miliband entering Downing Street, according to authoritative new research. Its voters have overwhelming come from those who voted Conservative in 2010 – and even the Liberal Democrats have shed more to them than Labour, election experts say. Most so-called ‘core Labour’ voters switching to Ukip had already deserted the party between 2001 and 2010 as a reaction to Tony Blair and New Labour, they have found. UKIP will inflict much more damage on the Conservatives than Labour in next year’s general election, increasing the chances of Ed Miliband entering Downing Street, according to authoritative new research . By contrast, switches from the Conservatives to Nigel Farage’s party are more recent and still happening – seriously undermining David Cameron’s chances of winning a Commons majority in May. Other findings of researchers at the British Election Study (BES) suggest the Lib Dems are on course for far greater losses next year than most have assumed. An analysis of the party’s support suggests it could do worse than ‘the already dire overall vote share in the polls and they are at risk of losing more than the half of their seats’. Meanwhile, a doubling of support for the Scottish Nationalists presages ‘big Labour losses’ north of the border and a ‘potentially pivotal role for the SNP in a hung parliament’. The rise of Ukip, the SNP and the Greens has prompted increasing fears in Whitehall that British voters are set to return a hung parliament for the second election in succession – the first time there would have been such an outcome since 1910. The collapse of the Lib Dems means that it is increasingly possible that only a three-party coalition will be able to muster enough seats to command a Commons majority. Tim Farron, the frontrunner to succeed Nick Clegg, has hinted the country could be ruled by coalition of Labour, the Lib Dems and the SNP. Alex Salmond, the former Scottish First Minister, announced at the weekend that he is to run for a Westminster seat for the SNP and is dropping ever stronger hints about his desire to play a key role in determining the next government. While Alex Salmond, (pictured right) the former Scottish First Minister, has ruled out any deal involving the Conservatives, he has suggested he might prop up a minority Labour government (pictured left Ed Miliband) He has ruled out any deal involving the Conservatives, but has suggested he might prop up a minority Labour government. Despite a hung parliament being the most likely outcome and a fairer reflection of the fragmented distribution of votes, the two main parties are on course to win 90 per cent of British seats from a combined share of around two-thirds of the vote, according to the BES research. Professor Geoff Evans, from the University of Oxford, a co-director of the BES, said it was clear David Cameron had most to fear from the rise of Ukip. Of Ukip supporters in Labour seats, only 18 per cent voted Labour in 2010, whereas 39 per cent were Conservatives,’ he said. Other findings suggest the Lib Dems are on course for far greater losses next year than most have assumed . ‘Our data shows quite clearly that it’s the Conservative Party who need to worry most about the threat of Ukip - because those people who supported Labour have in the main, already made the switch,’ he said. ‘New Labour’s move to the liberal consensus on the EU and immigration in 2001, 2005 and 2010, left many of their core voters out in the cold a long time before Ukip were around.’ Professor Evans said that because Ukip were picking up long disaffected former Labour voters, it was clear they would not pose such a threat to Labour seats. ‘In October, Labour narrowly held Heywood and Middleton in a strongly contested by-election, which showed high levels of Ukip support in a traditionally Labour voting constituency. ‘But BES data shows how Labour had lost these voters some time ago. Most Ukip voters who had voted Labour in 2005 had not voted for them in 2010. Ukip support in Labour constituencies is more likely to be taken from disaffected former Labour voters, and these are far more likely to be manual workers than the middle classes that New Labour appealed to.’ Of Ukip supporters in Labour seats, only 18 per cent voted Labour in 2010, whereas 39 per cent were Conservatives. Professor Jane Green from the University of Manchester, another co-director of the BES, said separate research showed that contrary to the popular view, Ukip is no more successful at winning over the politically disengaged than the other parties. Only the Greens are set to gain more in 2015 from people who didn’t vote in either the 2005 and 2010 elections,’ she said. Previous non-voters make up 19 per cent of those intending to vote Green – far higher than the other parties. As a percentage of all voters, those shifting to Labour and Conservative from not voting is higher than Ukip: 2.7 per cent for Labour, 2.2 per cent for Conservative but only for 1.4 per cent for Ukip.","New research suggests UKIP will inflict more damage on the Conservatives .

"We’re used to seeing Rube Goldberg machines on a manageable scale, using small objects like balls and cups to over-engineer a simple task via a series of chain reactions. But National Geographic UK have taken the classic device to a ridiculous scale in their latest promotional video. A human loop-the-loop, giant dominoes, a sail-powered car and explosions are all used in the impressive contraption. Scroll down for video . National Geographic UK has created a large Rube Goldberg Machine. The contraption begins with a simple Newton's Cradle (shown), but it quickly escalates to bigger and bigger designs . The video was created by National Geographic UK to promote their upcoming lineup of shows. It used 9 globes, 3 tyres, a Volkswagen beetle, bowling balls and much more to make everything work together. The finished article is a four-ton scientific contraption with 38 triggers and 71 moving pieces. In the video Tim Shaw, host of the show Street Genius, sets everything in motion with a simple Newton’s Cradle. This sets off larger and larger systems, with a particular highlight coming with a surprisingly giant set of dominoes. Later a person is sent diving around a loop-the-loop into a target, before balls set off a series of mini-explosions and a bowling ball goes for a strike. It culminates in a blast of fire around a hovering globe with the slogan: ‘Entertain your brain.’ This is promoting the science-based shows on the network, which include Street Genius, Science of Stupid and Brain Games. Such machines are inspired by the famous American cartoonist Rube Goldberg (4 July 1883 to 7 December 1970). He was best known for his popular cartoons depicting complicated gadgets performing simple tasks in indirect and convoluted ways. Street Genius premieres at 6pm on Sunday 18 January 6pm on National Geographic Channel. Giant dominoes are knocked over before a human does a loop-the-loop. The video, which culminates with explosions of fire (shown), is promoting science content on the National Geographic channel . Rube Goldberg's cartoons became known for depicting over-elaborate devices that performed simple tasks in convoluted ways. One example is 'Professor Butts and the Self-Operating Napkin' (above), which was later reprinted in the postcard book Rube Goldberg's Inventions. The 'self-operating napkin' is activated when soup spoon (A) is raised to mouth, pulling string (B) and thereby jerking ladle (C), which throws cracker (D) past parrot (E). Parrot jumps after cracker and perch (F) tilts, upsetting seeds (G) into pail (H). Extra weight in pail pulls cord (I), which opens and lights automatic cigar lighter (J), setting off skyrocket (K) which causes sickle (L) to cut string (M) and allow pendulum with attached napkin to swing back and forth, thereby wiping chin. In 1931, the Merriam-Webster dictionary defined 'Rube Goldberg' as accomplishing something simple through complex means.","National Geographic UK has created a large Rube Goldberg Machine .

"Mary Smith, 100, managed to fight off a gang of children who attacked her in a park before escaping on her high-speed mobility scooter . A 100-year-old great-grandmother managed to fight off a gang of children who attacked her in a park before escaping on her high-speed mobility scooter. Mary Smith, who is partially deaf and blind, was taking her dog and a neighbour's for a walk  in Rugby, Warwickshire, when she was attacked by the group of three or four boys. As the children, who were aged around ten, tried to drag her from her scooter and rifle through her bags, Mrs Smith grabbed her dog Xena and the other pet and drove straight at the gang, forcing them to scatter. The former Second World War dispatch rider then escaped on her high-speed scooter. Her daughter Rita Doggrell, 77, who also lives in Rugby, said her mother did not understand what was happening when she was set on by the boys. 'I can’t quite believe the lack of respect these boys showed to a woman of mum’s age,' she said. 'She had just started to go around the path and was taking her own dog and the neighbour’s dog for a walk when they just set upon her. 'Mum suffers quite badly with blindness and loss of hearing and can only really make out shapes so she couldn’t tell what was happening to begin with. 'She knows that a group of three or four young boys approached her and started trying to get her out of her mobility scooter. One of them even got onto it at one point.' Mrs Doggrell said her mother, who she described as inspirational for her age, was remarkably unshaken by the ordeal. 'Unfortunately nobody else was around to help,' she said. 'But thankfully she was able to fight them off, grab the dogs and get away from them. 'She is incredibly strong and very good for age so she just took it in her stride. Smith, who is partially deaf and blind, was taking her dog and a neighbour's for a walk in this park in Rugby, Warwickshire, when she was attacked by the boys, thought to be from a nearby illegal traveller camp . 'But it is completely unacceptable something like this should happen.' Widow Mrs Smith became the oldest person in Europe to have a pioneering cochlea implant earlier this year. The mother-of-three, who also has six grandchildren, did not report the attack to police.","Mary Smith was attacked by gang of boys while walking two dogs .

"Australians who join forces with Islamic State are being used as 'cannon fodder' by militants, the government has warned. Around a quarter of those who have fled to the Middle East to fight with Islamic State have been killed, as new warnings say that key battlegrounds such as the town of Kobane on the Turkish-Syrian border are fast becoming 'graveyards' for naive foreign fighters. The Australian reported that five or six Australians have been killed in Kobane in recent weeks, as Attorney General George Brandis revealed those who travel to fight with IS are being misled about their role. Scroll down for video . Queensland man Zia Abdul Haq (right), 33, was reportedly killed while fighting with IS in October . 'They (Islamic State) are simply using them as frontline cannon fodder, suicide bombers and propaganda tools,' Senator Brandis told The Australian. He also revealed that the death toll for Australian fighters had risen since last count in September by ASIO, one of those being that of ­Mohamed Ali Baryalei - a senior Islamic State recruiter. 'The government is aware of around 20 Australians who have died in the conflict in Syria and Iraq', Senator Brandis said. Ginger Jihadi Abdullah Elmir has appeared in two propaganda videos released by Islamic State . Around 20 Australians have now been killed in Iraq and Syria, such as senior IS recruiter Mohamed Ali Baryalei . It is understood nearly 100 Australians are now fighting in Syria and Iraq, such as Khaled Sharrouf (right) The war is fast turning into one of propaganda and publicity, and IS is said to be deliberately exploiting Western recruits by leading them to believe they are crucial to the fight. Queensland man Zia Abdul Haq, 33, is  one of the most recent casualties, killed while fighting with IS in October. Around 90 Australians are believed to be still fighting in the area including Australian-born ginger jihadist Abdullah Elmir who has appeared in two propaganda videos released by Islamic State. The 17-year-old, who grew up in Bankstown in Sydney's west, is seen in the latest video on the banks of the river Tigris, surrounded by dozens of men dressed in black wielding weapons. The production, titled An Evening On The Banks Of The Tigris River In The Province Of Nineveh In The Islamic State, is more than six minutes long and shows throngs of militants praying and chanting. Mohamed Elomar was a champion boxer before he joined the brutal Islamic State . Elomar gained notoriety after he tweeted pictures of the severed heads of Syrian soldiers. Professor Greg Barton, from Monash University's Global Terrorism Research Centre, said Elmir was recruited by another wanted terrorist, Mohammad Ali Baryalei, an Australian based in Syria. He said terror recruiters lured targets by making friends through social media, like many sexual predators. He said the boy appeared as a 'pawn in the machine' in the first chilling video. Elmir is not the only Aussie jihadist to have been used for Islamic State publicity. Sydney friends Mohamed Elomar and Khaled Sharrouf gained notoriety after they tweeted pictures of the severed heads of Syrian soldiers. Former boxer Elomar, the son of a successful 1970s Lebanese migrant, previously appeared on pay-per-view TV while championing at the combat sport. This year the 30-year-old’s smiling face was splashed across the news as he held up decapitated heads in Syria and threatened Australia with a terrorist attack. Sharouff a former Sydney resident, is thought to be fighting with IS and took his young sons to the Middle East with him . Sharrouf will be arrested on terrorism-related charges if he ever returns to Australia . Elomar and Sharrouf – who posted a photo on his Twitter account showing his seven-year-old son holding a severed head - are fighting with the al-Qaeda off-shoot and will be arrested on terrorism-related charges if they ever return to Australia. After one Twitter user told him not to come back, he replied: 'No u idiot injured, dnt worry wouldn't want to go bk u should be more worried about wats coming to australia! [sic]' Meanwhile, there are also reports that 20 fighters have returned home. An Australian man who has spent time on the frontline in Syria supported Senator Brandis' comments. Yehye El Kholed has been on numerous humanitarian trips to the area and warned that Australians were dying for the 'pride' of the leader of Islamic State Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. Kholed also echoed the claims that Western fighters were being deliberately misled, saying many militants often do not even know who they're fighting. The Australian government has warned Australians who flee to fight with Islamic State are being treated as expendable by the militants . Around 90 Australians are believed to be still fighting in the area, and there are also reports that 20 fighters have returned home .

"Britain's boardroom bosses saw their pay packets swell by 50 per cent last year, shocking figures show. A huge rise in bonuses and other share awards has seen the average pay of a FTSE100 chief executive hit £2.8million. The figure compares to £1.9million for the year before, and comes as the rest of the country is still seeing wage increases lagging behind inflation. Britain's boardroom bosses saw their pay packets swell by 50 per cent last year, shocking figures show . Analysis by accountancy firm Grant Thornton showed that the value of bonuses and other lucrative awards have almost doubled in a year for the UK’s best paid bosses. The increase comes at a time when company shareholders are expressing anger over boardroom largesse. Some of Britain’s biggest firms, including fashion house Burberry and oil producer BG Group, have seen revolts over pay. The report showed basic pay for the average FTSE 100 boss has risen from £578,000 to £583,000 – an increase of just one per cent. But the amount of bonuses and lucrative share awards they were handed has risen by some 80 per cent to £1.9million. Burberry was singled out in the report by Grant Thornton over its handling of a gigantic pay row with investors. The fashion house awarded its designer-turned-chief executive Christopher Bailey £20million in shares, taking his total package to £28million. Shareholders branded the move ‘obscene’, and a majority rejected Mr Bailey’s pay package. Burberry was singled out in the report by Grant Thornton over its handling of a gigantic pay row with investors over designer-turned-chief executive Christopher Bailey being awarded  £20million in shares, taking his total package to £28million . The report said: ‘Surprisingly, some companies still rely on the annual report and AGM to communicate with shareholders over executive pay.’ BG Group, which emerged from British Gas following privatisation, was last week forced to whittle down its proposed £25million welcome package for its new chief executive to a potential £18million. The windfall for Helge Lund had been described as ‘excessive and insensitive’ by business groups and had angered shareholders. Advertising giant WPP saw more than a third of its investors refuse to back a £30million pay award for chief executive Sir Martin Sorrell last year. The review is based on analysis of companies’ annual reports, in which they detail annual pay awards for executives. Following a wave of investor revolts two years ago, companies are now forced to publish a single figure for the amount their top executives could stand to earn. Basic pay for the average FTSE 100 boss has risen from £578,000 to £583,000 – an increase of just one per cent. But the amount of bonuses and lucrative share awards they were handed has risen by some 80 per cent to £1.9million . The report also breaks down the levels of bonuses available by sector. While mining companies tend to the have the highest average basic pay at £598,000, banks and financial services firms have the highest levels of bonuses. On average, bank chief executives can earn up to four and a half times their basic pay in bonuses and share awards. Technology companies tend to have the lowest level of bonuses, which bosses able to earn up to two and a half times their basic pay in extra awards. RBS, the taxpayer-backed bank, ignited outrage after quietly handing its new chief executive Ross McEwan £1.5million in free shares on New Year’s Eve last year. Mr McEwan, who is already paid a basic salary of £1million, was being reimbursed for missing out on bonuses after leaving his previous job. The controversial move came on the same day that Goldman Sachs revealed ‘obscene’ £3million pay deals for a clutch of its top bankers. Last year the Church of England vowed to ‘turn the tide’ on a culture of lavish bonuses for bankers and business chiefs. The Church, led by Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby, promised to use the significant financial firepower of its investments to vote against excessive pay packages and criticised the ‘culture of entitlement and greed’ in big businesses. Despite attempts to cap bankers’ bonuses, many City banks have found ways to circumvent the new rules by offering staff lucrative share deals and other perks.","A huge rise in bonuses and other share awards have driven up salaries .

"Builders are hiring Portuguese bricklayers on £1,000 a week because not enough Britons can do the job. Skilled workers are in such short supply they can demand double the normal day rate of £100. A month ago the Mail revealed that a similar labour shortage had forced the UK’s biggest sandwich manufacturer to recruit in Hungary because it could not fill its production line with local workers. Shortage: Builders are hiring Portuguese bricklayers on £1,000 a week because not enough Britons can do the job and as skilled workers are in such short supply they can demand double the normal day rate of £100 . Portugal has become a hot spot for builders while energy firms are hiring Spanish engineers, according to James Hick of recruiters Manpower. ‘There is a severe shortage of skilled tradespeople in Britain – bricklayers, plumbers, electricians, mechanical engineers, HGV drivers,’ he added. ‘Where they were paying £500 a week at the beginning of the year, the demand for those skills means they are now paying £1,000 a week. ‘That pressure on skills is huge, particularly in the construction industry in the South East and London.’ He accused UK firms of halting training schemes in the downturn and being left short when construction picked up. ‘That is not something that can be resolved quickly, but companies need people who can work now, so they have had to put up pay and look elsewhere’, he added. Hiring: A month ago the it was revealed that a similar labour shortage  forced the UK’s biggest sandwich manufacturer Greencore to recruit in Hungary because it could not fill its production line with local workers . Workers: Greencore staff hard at work in one of their factories - but bosses are struggling to find people who want to work in its new £35 million factory in Northampton, which is due to open in 2016 . Philip Davies, Tory MP for Shipley in West Yorkshire, said: ‘It is a sad state of affairs when people in this country are not capable of doing the jobs that other people can. That is why the Government is right to focus on apprenticeships, instead of sending people on a conveyer belt to university on a course which will be of no use to them. ‘Apprenticeships will teach people the skills that are needed, so that we do not need to go abroad for them.’ Mark Dicks, of Guirard & Dicks, a bricklaying firm in London, said half of his annual recruits were from abroad, chiefly Ukraine and Poland, and they were able to insist on £200 a day. ‘If it was not for Eastern Europeans coming over there would be a bigger shortage,’ said Mr Dicks. Looking abroad: A recruitment fair in the Sheraton Hotel, Porto in Portugal advertises for nurses to come to England and work at Bedford Hospital . Hiring: It was reported that high street chain Next was hiring thousands of cheap Eastern European workers to work in South Elmsall, West Yorkshire, where unemployment is high . ‘It is just the younger generation, they have grown up with computers. It died off probably because the money was not very good either.’ Malcolm Thorpe of the Guild of Bricklayers said £1,000 a week was a ‘ridiculous’ wage. He added: ‘If we carried on continually training then we would be okay. The first thing that goes is training.’ Manpower referenced a survey which found one in three large London construction firms have had to turn down bidding opportunities because of a shortage of skilled workers. Last month, the Mail reported that hospitals were hiring hundreds of nurses from Portugal without properly checking their English. It was also reported that Next was hiring thousands of cheap Eastern European workers to work in South Elmsall, West Yorkshire, where unemployment is high. Viewpoint: Philip Davies, Tory MP for Shipley in West Yorkshire, said the Government 'is right to focus on apprenticeships', while Work and pensions secretary Iain Duncan Smith has said the benefits system encourages skills shortages by allowing people to live comfortably without work . An agency based in Warsaw claimed the firm, run by Conservative peer Lord Wolfson, has already taken on 7,000 Poles. Work and pensions secretary Iain Duncan Smith has said the benefits system encourages skills shortages by allowing people to live comfortably without work. Business Secretary Vince Cable will announce today that the Government has fulfilled its commitment to starting two million apprenticeships in this Parliament. A spokesman for the Department for Communities and Local Government said: ‘Government-led efforts over the past four years have got Britain building, creating thousands of jobs. In November, ministers agreed with housebuilders to create tens of thousands of jobs and apprenticeships on sites across the country, to nurture home-grown talent for many years to come.’ The unemployment rate in Portugal – at 14.6 per cent – is far higher than the UK’s 6 per cent. The average annual salary is £10,000 compared with £26,500 here.","Similar labour shortage forced sandwich firm to recruit in Hungary .

"The distraught family of murdered bride Anni Dewani yesterday said the unanswered questions about her husband’s actions would haunt them forever. They spoke as Shrien Dewani was dramatically cleared of murdering Anni during the couple’s honeymoon in South Africa. The millionaire businessman was freed after a judge halted his trial. He had not even had to testify. Anguish: Anni Dewani's sister Ami weeps yesterday as she talks about the decision to free Shrien Dewani . Freed: The millionaire businessman was freed after a judge halted his trial. He had not even had to testify . Judge Jeanette Traverso ruled that the evidence against him was ‘riddled with contradictions’. But she added that it was ‘regrettable’ that so many things remained unclear surrounding the murder of Anni, who was shot in a staged carjacking as she was driven through a notorious township four years ago. Anni’s family fled Cape Town’s high court as the ruling was announced, and later wept as they declared: ‘The justice system has failed us.’ Her father Vinod has pledged to sue Dewani for not revealing his homosexuality and leading his daughter and the family into a marriage that was a sham. Dewani, 34, his hair cut neatly, remained impassive as he was formally told he was not guilty before briefly returning to the court cells where he took a selfie of himself with a police officer on a mobile phone, witnesses said. Lies: Anni's father Vinod has pledged to sue Dewani for not revealing his homosexuality and leading his daughter and the family into a marriage that was a sham . Judge: Dewani was found not guilty after Cape Town High Court judge Jeanette Traverso (pictured) ruled that the prosecution's case did not have sufficient evidence to convict him . The whole family are expected to return to their home in Bristol in the next couple of days as soon as Dewani leaves the South African psychiatric hospital where he has been held since losing his four-year extradition battle earlier this year. On the court steps, Anni’s sister, Ami Denborg wept as she said: ‘The justice system has failed us. We came here looking for answers and we came here looking for the truth and all we got was more questions. ‘We never heard the full story of Shrien. We heard that Shrien has a led double life and that Anni knew nothing about it. ‘The knowledge of not ever knowing what happened to my dearest little sister on the 13th November 2010 is going to haunt me, my family, my brother, my parents for the rest of our lives.’ Dewani, who admitted sleeping with gay prostitutes during his courtship of Anni, was accused of plotting with taxi driver Zola Tongo to arrange for two hitmen to kill his new wife a fortnight after they married at a £200,000 wedding in India. Tongo, gunman Mziwamadoda Qwabe and middleman Monde Mbolombo all told the court that she was murdered at the request of her husband for a payment of £1,200. But the judge dismissed it as ‘improbable’ testimony of ‘self-confessed liars.’ She said: ‘It contained so many mistakes, lies and inconsistencies that one simply cannot know where the lies end and the truth begins.’ Distraught: Anish Hindocha wipes away the tears with father Vinod Hindocha and mother Nilam as they address the media outside the court after the not guilty verdict . Outside court, prosecutors insisted the judge had not gone as far as declaring Dewani innocent. Spokesman Nathi Ncube said: ‘To say we’ve got an innocent man is an unfair statement because he was implicated by three witnesses and…the court can only pronounce on those witnesses.’ Anni’s uncle Ashok spoke of the family’s fury, saying they had been denied the full story and would suffer ‘sleepless nights for the rest of our lives’. He told MailOnline: ‘We will always live without ever knowing the complete events. ‘But she would not have married him if she had known about his secret sex life with male prostitutes. Neither would we have, as a family, condoned [such] a union. ‘We will now go through this case with our lawyers to confirm whether we can file a lawsuit against Shrien Dewani in the UK.’ Tongo and Qwabe are both serving reduced jail sentences for murder in return for testifying against Dewani. It will be up to prosecutors if Mbolombo faces criminal proceedings after the judge removed his immunity for being a state witness. Xolile Mngeni, the second hit man, died in jail during the trial.","Shrien Dewani  cleared of murdering bride Anni on honeymoon .

"The traditional Christmas chocolate treat Ferrero Rocher is under threat from a shortage of one of its main ingredients - hazelnuts. Production of the chocolate - famed for its cheesy adverts set at an ambassador's reception - has been hit a global shortage of hazelnuts caused by a washout of crops following bad weather. The cost of hazelnuts has increased by more than 60 per cent already this year after hail storms and frost obliterated crops in Turkey, where about 70 per cent of the world’s hazelnuts are harvested. The traditional Christmas chocolate treat Ferrero Rocher is under threat from a shortage of one of its main ingredients - hazelnuts . Production of the chocolate - famed for its cheesy adverts set at an ambassador's reception - has been hit a global shortage of hazelnuts . Ferrero, the Italian parent company, buys a quarter of Turkey's annual crop for it's products, including Nutella, the chocolate spread. It has resulted in a stark increase in the wholesale price of the nut, which rose to £6,300 ($10,500) per tonne from just £3,900 ($6,500) per tonne in February. While the extent of the damage to the hazelnut flowers on Turkey’s Black Sea coast is not yet fully evident, it is feared about 300,000 tonnes of the crop could have been damaged in March’s poor weather. In demand: A poor hazelnut harvest in Turkey has lead to price rises and shortages. File picture . The company told The Sun it does not expect any production problems. The news comes after continued warnings about the rising cost of cocoa which has continued to soar as demand outstrips production. Experts have warned that a growing taste for chocolate in Asia – particularly in China – means cocoa farmers will need more help to provide a greater amount to . export or manufacturers will be forced to use less cocoa in their products. It is feared the rising demand could become unsustainable by 2020, unless more is done to help cocoa growing communities. The threat of a global shortage of both cocoa and hazelnuts comes as bad news for chocolate makers – many of whom combine the ingredients for their products.","Production of the chocolate treat has been hampered by hazelnut shortage .

"Melbourne photographer Jonas Peterson has shot weddings in some of the most idyllic parts of the world but his recent assignment to Masai Mara in Kenya has blown some of the most romantic locations off the top of his impressive list. The destination wedding photographer, originally from Sweden but has called Australia home for the past decade, has travelled to at least 300 jobs around the globe but nothing could have prepared him for the magic of the African savanna. 'Some places stay with you forever. When Nina and her Sebastian asked me to shoot their wedding in Masai Mara in Kenya, I didn't know this land would touch me so deeply,' Peterson said. 'It sung to me in a way I didn't know possible, found new chords and played on strings I didn't know I had inside me.' Scroll down for video . Swedish couple Nina and Sebastian got married in September and Melbourne photographer Jonas Peterson captured the occasion . The romantic mood was further enhanced by the dark storm rolling in which made for the perfect backdrop . Nina, a wildlife photographer, has had a close connection to the Masai Mara after spending a couple of months a year in Kenya following one pride of lions for a project about the world's last wild lions . But it did not rain on the parade as the bridal party and guests made it uncover just five minutes before the brooding skies opened up . The traditional Masai Mara elements incorporated into the wedding added to the emotion on the day. 'It was very interesting to see how these cultures came together - it was beautiful and made it all the more powerful,' Peterson said. The mood was further enhanced by the storm rolling in which made for the perfect backdrop - but it did not rain on the parade as the bridal party and guests made it uncover just five minutes before the sky opened up. The wedding was held during the migration of wildebeest from Serengeti National Park in Tanzania to the Masai Mara in the neighbouring country of Kenya. 'There animals everywhere which caused a bit of a problem. We needed to have guards at the wedding so animals such as lions didn't wander in,' Peterson said. 'It was like the Garden of Eden with thousands, and probably even millions, of animals as far as the eye can see.' Peterson described the national park as 'The Garden of Eden' Surreal footage of the newly married bride and groom with a zebra strolling past either side of the couple . Nina says it was very important to the couple to incorporate some of the traditions of the Maasai culture into the ceremony . The 42-year-old, who has visited Africa a couple of times before but never to Kenya, was so blown away by the scenery that he had to keep reminding himself to take photographs. 'It was such a powerful experience - it's surprising how nature and vast savannah will do things to you.' Peterson said the location doesn't necessarily make a great wedding - it's all about the feeling. 'I've had amazing weddings in Geelong and then terrible weddings in Mexico,' he said. 'If the emotion isn't there it doesn't really matter.' Rating California, Sri Lanka and the volcanic islands outside of Sicily as some of his favourite weddings, Peterson admits that the Masai Mara is the 'most amazing place he has ever been to'. 'It was the perfect storm in many ways - it was absolutely perfect - culturally, emotionally and location-wise.' 'It sung to me in a way I didn't know possible, found new chords and played on strings I didn't know I had inside me' Peterson says . The tradionational Masai jewellery, called enkarewa, was also very special aspect of the magical ceremony . Guards were on standby throughout the day to prevent any animals wandering into the wedding . The lucky couple made it undercover just before the storm hit across the vast plains . Nina, a wildlife photographer, has had a close connection to the Masai Mara after spending a couple of months a year in Kenya following one pride of lions for a project about the world's last wild lions. 'During this time I have become very close friends and almost family with the Maasai who have welcomed me into their lives,' she said. 'Therefore and because we were planning to hold our ceremony on the land of the Maasai it was very important to us to incorporate some of the traditions of the Maasai culture into the ceremony,' 'For example the arch built is a traditional symbol of the entrance to a boma – the typical house construction of the Maasai, and after the announcement a traditional Maasai song and dance followed according to tradition. 'Some places stay with you forever. I didn't know this land would touch me so deeply': Peterson says . The occasion was made even more special by the fact the couple got to share the special day with their two-year-old daughter . The jewellery, called enkarewa, was also very special aspect of the magical ceremony. 'When I first told my closest friend in the Maasai community about our wedding early in 2014 he came back to me with a necklace and bracelets as a special gift made for me by his family, Nina said. 'The stick carried by Sebastian was also a gift from the local Maasai community.' 'But even more generously my friend then offered to bring warriors from the Maasai community to the celebration. So in the end our two cultures and nature merged in the perfect moment and the best day of our lives.' The occasion was made even more special by the fact the couple got to share the special day with their two-year-old daughter. Peterson could not have asked for a more magical backdrop as the storm drew closer . The wedding was held during the migration of wildebeest from Serengeti National Park in Tanzania to the Masai Mara in the neighbouring country of Kenya . The Maasai tribespeople have become part of Nina and Sebastian's extended family . Masai Mara is Peterson's number one destination out of at least 300 locations he has travelled to for weddings . 'In the end our two cultures and nature merged in the perfect moment and the best day of our lives,' Nina says . A Maasai friend gave Nina the customary wedding jewellery (left) and Sebastian was given the stick as a gift from Maasai community (right) Nina and Sebastian described their wedding as the 'perfect moment' when two cultures merged . Stuff that only movies are made of: Nina's loving look at her new husband while her wedding dress hangs with elephants as a backdrop . Peterson spent another five says at Masai Mara after the wedding and fell in love with the incredible sunsets and sunrises . Peterson says the destination can be pointless if there was no emotion which was not a problems on Nina and Sebastian's big day . 'It was such a powerful experience - it's surprising how nature and vast savannah will do things to you': Peterson says . Rating California, Sri Lanka and the volcanic islands outside of Sicily as some of his favourite weddings, Peterson admits that the Masai Mara is the 'most amazing place he has ever been to' 'I've had amazing weddings in Geelong and then terrible weddings in Mexico.

"A cop killer on death row, who is set to be executed on Tuesday, has made an 11th-hour appeal not to be put to death after his defense lawyer admitted to downing vodka during his trial. Robert Wayne Holsey was sentenced to death for shooting dead a sheriff's deputy, Will Robinson, in 1995 while he robbed a store in Milledgeville, Georgia. The killer had appealed for clemency after it emerged that his defense attorney was drinking a quart of vodka a day during his trial and later admitted  that he was in no fit state to represent anyone at the time. Robert Wayne Holsey (pictured left) was sentenced to death for shooting dead a sheriff's deputy in Georgia in 1995, Will Robinson (right) Holsey's new legal team has argued that because his lawyer was an alcoholic, he never received adequate representation at trial. The jury did not hear about Holsey's intellectual disability or his horrific childhood during his 1997 trail, according to NBC. The killer's trial attorney was disbarred in 2006 because of his drinking problem and also for stealing from a client. Holsey's lawyer said that he will take his appeal to the high court if the clemency request is struck down by the parole board. The killer shot 26-year-old Deputy Robinson once in the right arm and once behind his right ear during a traffic stop following the robbery. He was arrested three hours later. The suspect was found guilty of all charges in February 1997 and sentenced to death. Deputy Robinson is survived by his parents and two brothers. On a memorial page for the fallen officer, his mother recently wrote: 'We are nearing the end of the 19-year journey through the State of GA and the US Justice Systems. 'We have an execution date, December 9, 2014, and your family will be there to see end.' She added: 'Closure? There is none. Ever. However we will finish the arduous appeals process and justice will be served. We will then celebrate the memories and happy times.

"Chantelle McMillan has been jailed for 11 years after she attacked a couple with her sister and two friends, which led to a man being injured after he was pushed through a shop window in Looe . Two sisters have been jailed for 21 years for a vicious gang attack on a man celebrating his 40th birthday with his wife. Jamie Skinner was thrown into a shop window and then punched, kicked and stamped on in the street while his wife was hit with the heel of a stiletto in the attack by Chantelle McMillan and her sister Valena, a mother of three, along with their friend Brett Lourens. Mr Skinner suffered a fractured eye socket after being set upon by the group in Looe in Cornwall. The sisters along with 22-year-old Lourens were convicted at Truro Crown Court of causing Mr Skinner grievous bodily harm with intent. A jury also found them guilty of attempting to cause grievous bodily harm with intent to his wife Catherine. They were jailed for 31 years between them for the unprovoked attack. Another friend of the sisters Jack Brooks, 23, was convicted of intending to do grievous bodily harm to the 40-year-old and was jailed for eight years. He had previously admitted inflicting grievous bodily harm on Mr Skinner. The court heard Mr and Mrs Skinner had been in the Ship Inn celebrating his birthday on July 12 last year. They had been drinking and dancing in the pub before they left and encountered the group in the street. Valena McMillan, 30, of Duloe, Cornwall, confronted Mr Skinner, swore at him, grabbed his T-shirt and punched him in the face. Her 24-year-old sister, who has a history of violence, and Lourens then joined in and 'threw repeated punches to Mr Skinner's head and body.' Prosecutor Phillip Lee said: 'He was pushed into the window of a nearby shop so it smashed. He was kicked and stamped on by Valena McMillan, Chantelle McMillan and Brett Lourens.' As he tried to get up, Brooks punched, kicked and stamped on Mr Skinner with another mystery male. And three of them also assaulted Mrs Skinner leaving her with cuts to her head.

Chantelle McMillan, the younger of the two sisters then used the point of a stiletto heel to hit Mrs Skinner on the head while 'moaning and roaring' like an animal. The couple, of Plymouth, were taken to Derriford Hospital where Mr Skinner required surgery for a fractured eye socket. He also suffered bruising to his eyes and tenderness to his wrist after being pushed through the shop window in Buller Street in Looe, near the Ship Inn. Lourens (left) and Brooks (right) are pictured leaving Truro Crown Court during their trial for the attack . During the trial the court heard Mr Skinner had done a mooney in the street before the attack took place. Shortly before he had been set upon the jury was told Mr Skinner saw a girl sitting on the pavement outside and asked her if she was alright. He said she had told him he had been hit in the face and Mr Skinner advised her to call an ambulance, before he left because she was with other people. Valena McMillan, a mother of three, launched at Mr Skinner and punched him in the face as the attack started . Valena McMillan was sentenced to nine years for the attack on Mr Skinner and one year for assaulting Mrs Skinner. Lourens, 22, of Duloe, received the same sentences, both to run consecutively to a total of 10 years. Chantelle McMillan, who was the subject of a suspended sentence for another violent offence at the time of the attacks on July 12, 2013, was sentenced to nine years in respect of the assault on Mr Skinner and two years for attacking his wife.","Jamie Skinner was celebrating his 40th birthday with wife in Looe, Cornwall .

"A New York City science teacher has pleaded not guilty to repeatedly molesting at least nine elementary school girls in Brooklyn. Omil Carrasquillo, 36, entered the plea at his arraignment Monday. He was released on $200,000 bail and is due back in court February 6. The alleged victims, all students at The Caton School PS 249 in Brooklyn, were between ages 9-11. Carrasquillo was originally arrested in September for allegedly fondling four girls, but investigators have since identified five more victims. Scroll down for video . Bad teacher: Omil Carrasquillo, 36, pictured left in court Monday and right with his wife, Dana, is accused of molesting nine girls at his Brooklyn elementary school . The incidents allegedly took place at The Caton School PS 249 in Kensington section of Brooklyn . Carrasquillo, a US Army veteran, lives in Selden, Long Island, with his 33-year-old wife, Dana, and their 7-year-old son. According to prosecutors, the encounters between the teacher and his young students occurred between 2013 and September of this year, when school officials learned of the allegations against Carrasquillo and removed him from the school. Brooklyn District Attorney Kenneth Thompson says the defendant was 'an alleged predator who surrounded himself with vulnerable victims.' During his arraignment Monday, Carrasquillo's defense attorney told the judge his client was not a flight risk because he had served in the military. Investigators say the incidents involved the married teacher touching the girls' private parts and rubbing their breasts and buttocks, reported 7Online. Family man: The accused teacher is pictured here with his wife and their 7-year-old son . Broken trust: Police say Carrasquillo repeatedly touched his young students' private parts and rubbed their breasts and buttocks . ‘These allegations are disturbing, and we removed Mr. Carrasquillo immediately: He is not near any students. We are investigating the matter and supporting this school community,’ the New York City Department of Education said in a statement. After his arrest in September, Carrasquillo allegedly told police he ‘gives and receive hugs from his students,’ but conceded that some of his touches could be misinterpreted, reported the New York Daily News. ‘Mr. Carrasquillo states that he will give the girls and boys a hug if they have done something good or they will come to him and hug,’ a police report stated. The teacher also said that sometimes he would place a hand on a student’s back or shoulder while explaining classwork, and also he would touch the kids on their legs or arms to draw their attention. His version of events: The 36-year-old father told police his students may have misinterpreted his touches . 'Upstanding citizen': Carrasquillo, pictured left and right, was hired as a teacher in 2006 after retiring from the US Army and the National Guard . Carrasquillo resigned from his post at the Brooklyn school in September after eight years on the job. He is currently facing nearly two dozen counts of sexual abuse and endangering the welfare of a child. According to the disgraced educator’s attorney, Anthony La Pinta, his client was honorably discharged from the Army in 2000 and then volunteered for the National Guard. He spent a month working at Ground Zero after the 9/11 attacks and also coached athletes for the Special Olympics.","Omil Carrasquillo, 36, charged with slew of sexual abuse and child endangerment counts stemming from incidents at PS 249 .

"This is the moment thieves were caught on camera stealing a couple's charity Christmas lights display. The brazen thieves, branded 'scum of the Earth' by their victims, were caught on CCTV helping themselves to about £200 worth of festive decorations, including a three-foot plastic Santa, a three-foot snowman and a large gnome. Fundraisers Geoff and Tina Patchett, who have been decking out their home in Redcar, Teesside, with Christmas lights and decorations for years, condemned the thieves' actions and said they had 'stolen from the community'. The thieves, branded 'scum of the Earth' by their victims, were caught on CCTV helping themselves to about £200 worth of festive decorations from the house in Redcar, Teesside, including a three-foot plastic Santa . Fundraisers Geoff and Tina Patchett, who have been decking out their property with Christmas lights and festive decorations for years, condemned the thieves' actions and said they had 'stolen from the community' Mr Patchett, a retired process supervisor, has raised thousands of pounds for charity with the display outside the front of his house, and regularly stays up past midnight to guard his beloved decorations. However, after he had gone to bed on Friday, the hooded thieves targeted the home at about 1.30am, and could be seen on CCTV raiding the display. Dressed in hooded tops, one suspect - with a cigarette in his mouth - took the items, while another raided the garden while allegedly carrying wire cutters. In the footage, the pair can be seen almost tiptoeing through the garden as they pick out which items to take before lifting them off the front lawn and onto the driveway. Mr Patchett, 68, said: 'I've spent a lot of time unravelling the CCTV over the weekend and I am confident someone out there will know who they are. 'They left the garden in a bit of a mess, I think they were spooked by someone because a few items that had been cut free were left behind. The thieves were caught on CCTV, dressed in hooded tops, raiding the home in the early hours of Friday . Police said one suspect, with a cigarette in his mouth, helped himself to decorations while another kept watch . 'The Santa in particular will be easy to spot as you can't get them in the shops any more. It was donated to the display a couple of years ago by a passer-by.' The couple, who between them have nine children, 21 grandchildren and 11 great-grandchildren, said they began decorating their home for the joy it brought to the community. However, they turned it into an annual fundraising mission when people suggested they should raise money for charity. They have raised more than £3,000 over the years, including a record-breaking £1,166 last year for the Great North Air Ambulance. With this year's display their biggest and best yet, the couple had hoped to raise more than ever for their chosen good cause, the Redcar Lifeboat. Geoff Patchett has been decking out his house with festive decorations for years and often stays up past midnight to keep watch over his beloved display. The thieves struck after he had gone to bed on Friday . The couple decorate the house to raise money for charity and this year will donate to Redcar Lifeboat . Mr Patchett added: 'You try and do your bit for charity and then you get people like this ruining it for everyone. As much as this is for charity, it's for the kids to enjoy too. 'So whoever has done this has not only stole from us, but from the rest of the community. I just hope we catch them.' The couple's display this year includes a few new attractions, including a parachuting Santa and a reindeer with sleigh. Mr Patchett said the whole collection has cost them 'thousands'.

"Meet the python on a murderous cane toad rampage. The snake was spotted wrapping itself around the neck of a cane toad in the car park of Darwin's Sky City Casino this week. It's believed to have killed at least another two in as many days. Scroll down for video . A snake was spotted wrapping itself around the neck of a cane toad in the car park of Darwin's Sky City Casino this week . 'When I first looked I had a thought that someone had got a cane toad and put on some Christmas decorations,' Jason Carpenter, who snapped the photo, told the NT News. 'Then I realised it was a cane toad with a python wrapped round it. It was a negative outcome for the toad.' The snake, nicknamed 'The Assassinator', doesn't stick around to eat the cane toads and instead just leaves their bloated bodies in the casino car park, which is how Mr Carpenter stumbled across it. He joked that the snake should train up his friends to help round up and kill more cane toads to stop the pest destroying native species and the environment. It comes following revelations freshwater crocodiles in the Northern Territory had worked out ways to eat cane toads without being poisoned by just chewing off the legs. The snake, nicknamed 'The Assassinator', doesn't stick around to eat the cane toads and instead just leaves their bloated bodies in the casino car park . Crocodile specialist Dr Adam Britton told Daily Mail Australia last week that he and his wife had discovered a significant amount of toxic cane toads with missing legs in rivers 500 kilometres from Darwin. 'My wife Erin did some surveys in 2009 after the cane toads reached the areas. She observed the twisted and mangled toads and noticed the crocodile teeth marks,' Mr Britton said. 'We know that they often like to flick and tear off whatever they're holding in their mouth and that's what we're seeing a lot around the area.

'We were sceptical at first but now we've seen patterns and it's obvious that they're mangling the back legs to feed themselves.' The poisonous cane toads have the power to effect the crocodile population, according to Mr Britton. ‘The toads have toxins in parts of their body that will usually kill the crocodiles when they consume them,’ he said. 'The ones who have been tearing of their legs from its limbs are the ones who have survived.'

"Foreign criminals and illegal immigrants have pocketed almost £17million in compensation for being locked up for too long while officials fight to deport them, it has been revealed. Sex offenders, robbers and drug dealers who are not supposed to be in Britain have been paid huge sums of taxpayers’ money because they were wrongly detained by the Home Office. In a slap in the face to the British public, at least 229 offenders were among more than 480 individuals handed controversial payouts for being unlawfully held under immigration powers in the past four years. Foreign criminals and illegal immigrants have pocketed almost £17million in compensation for being locked up for too long while officials fight to deport them, it has been revealed . Even though Home Secretary Theresa May wanted them removed from the UK, hundreds sued, claiming their human right to liberty had been breached. Last night MPs and campaigners condemned the cost to the public purse and said judges who awarded the vast payments, averaging around £25,000, were making a mockery of the justice system. Conservative MP Michael Ellis, who sits of the Commons’ home affairs committee, said: ‘No wonder people think the law is an ass. To hear of some cases where dangerous criminals have been given large amounts of money is tantamount to a perversion of the justice system. People will be appalled.’ Even though Home Secretary Theresa May (left) wanted them removed from the UK, hundredsof offenders have claimed their human right to liberty was breached. Immigration Minister James Brokenshire (right) has revealed that £4.8million in 2013-14 was paid out last year . Unlawful: Nemah Shehadeh was held for a year . Nemah Shehadeh was awarded £36,000 after being held following an attempt to deport her to Jordan. The deportation failed in January 2008 when she claimed to be a Palestinian. A judge at the Court of Session in Edinburgh ruled that the then 58-year-old was unlawfully detained for one year from August 2008. She was originally issued with a six-month visitor visa to come to Britain on the basis that she was a Jordanian citizen. She arrived in August 2002 but overstayed. She was arrested in 2005 at Heathrow with a son when they were attempting to use false French passports to travel to Canada, and subsequently sentenced to four months imprisonment with a recommendation for deportation. After the failed bid to deport her to Jordan, the Home Office placed her in detention while her case was for release considered – with rigorous reporting restrictions. Judges agreed this was unlawful and ordered compensation. Immigration Minister James Brokenshire revealed that £4.5million was paid out in 2011-12, £5million in 2012-13, £4.8million in 2013-14 and £2.1million so far in the year to September. That amounts to £16.4million compensation. Of this, at least £6.2million was awarded to 229 criminals who had been unlawfully detained while waiting to be booted out of the country after finishing prison sentences – roughly £27,000 per offender. The UK does not specify how long people can be kept in immigration detention before deportation, with Home Office guidance saying it should not extend beyond a ‘reasonable period’. But some cases involve illegal immigrants who refuse to reveal where they are from so the authorities have to waste time trying to locate their homelands. Others put in multiple appeals or asylum claims over several years to try to ‘frustrate’ attempts to remove them, said Mandie Campbell, the director general of Immigration Enforcement at the Home Office. Many cases also involve criminals who the Home Office do not want to release amid concerns they are a risk of committing more crimes or absconding. In one instance, Joseph Mjemer – branded a ‘one-man crime wave’ – was jailed for two years just a year after winning £17,360 compensation for being unlawfully detained while awaiting deportation. He used at least five aliases and claimed to be from four countries. Jonathan Isaby, chief executive of the Taxpayers’ Alliance pressure group, said payouts could be avoided if Home Office staff were more efficient. ‘Taxpayers will be furious that their cash is being wasted thanks to Home Office bungling,’ he said. ‘Unlawful detention doesn’t just hurt those who are kept under lock and key, but costs an extraordinary amount. The authorities must do a better job.’ Former coalition minister Sarah Teather, who uncovered the figures, accused the Home Office of treating people inhumanely and costing the taxpayer millions. ‘It appears that the Home Office would sometimes rather detain people indefinitely than treat them humanely, even if this ends up costing the taxpayer millions of pounds,’ said the Lib Dem MP. ‘But these figures shouldn’t obscure the considerable emotional and mental cost that not knowing how long you might be detained for, or if you’re going to be deported tomorrow, or moved hundreds of miles away to a different detention centre, has on detainees.’ The UK made the second-highest use of detention for asylum seekers in Europe in 2013, with more than 30,000 asylum seekers spending some time in detention. Some who have been paid compensation have subsequently been deported, while others remain in the UK.","Offenders sue for being unlawfully held under immigration powers .

"Chilling new images have emerged from inside Islamic State-run terrorist training schools in Syria, showing child soldiers being trained to kill using assault rifles. Dubbed 'Caliphate Cubs', the children appear little more than 10 years old and are dressed in full combat gear as they struggle to hold weapons while standing in front of ISIS' infamous black flag. The photographs were released by official Islamic State media over the weekend and apparently show a recently-opened school close to  Damascus - the Assad regime-held capital of Syria where other preteen training camps are known have been operating in recent months. Scroll down for video . Chilling: Dubbed 'Caliphate Cubs', the children appear little more than 10 years old and are dressed in full combat gear as they struggle to hold weapons while standing in front of ISIS' infamous black flag . Loss of innocence: A fair-skinned boy is handed an AK47 assault rifle by a grey-bearded ISIS general as he stands in formation alongside other young child soldiers . The photographs taken near the Syrian capital Damascus and released by Islamic State terrorists show young children wearing masks and camouflaged military fatigues as they are trained to use AK47 assault rifles and carry out military drills. The high quality photographs were released on ISIS' favoured anonymous file sharing website JustPaste.it over the weekend, and appear to be still images taken from an as-yet unreleased edition of the terror group's many professionally shot propaganda videos. In one photograph a large group of masked and armed child soldiers crowd around a minibus decorated with the ISIS flag, holding their guns aloft and striking poses bearing a striking resemblance to the terror group's executioner in chief - the British militant known as Jihadi John. Another image shows a fair-skinned boy being handed a massive AK47 assault rifle by a grey-bearded ISIS general as he stands in formation alongside other young child soldiers. Other shots from the propaganda release show the children performing fitness tests and military drills designed to train them for the harsh realities of the frontline. Training: In much the same way as the Nazi Germany preyed on its impressionable young citizens with the creation of the Hitler Youth, ISIS has long groomed children to take part in jihad . The photographs were released on ISIS' favoured anonymous file sharing website JustPaste.it this weekend . In a clear display of ISIS' callous attitude towards the use of child soldiers, one photograph from the terror group's latest media release shows two bearded adult militants laughing and leaning against a lorry while a group of young boys are forced to carry out military exercises in front of them. Other shots show the heavily armed boys carrying their weapons inside what appears to be a mosque, where there appear to be taking instructions on how to use an AK47 from another masked militant, who stands in front of what looks like a minbar - a type of pulpit used by Islamic preachers. In much the same way as the Nazi Germany preyed on its impressionable young citizens with the creation of the Hitler Youth, ISIS has long groomed children to take part in jihad. The practice was the subject of the second episode of VICE's groundbreaking 'Islamic State' documentary series, in which very young boys were seen being asked whether they want to be a suicide bomber or a jihadist, and were forced to repeat calls for the murder of Western 'infidels'.

Well-crafted: The photographs appear to be still images taken from an as-yet unreleased edition of the terror group's many professionally shot propaganda videos . In the VICE footage, ISIS' PR man Abu Moussa - who has since been killed - describes how every male child is forced to attend Sharia camps to be taught the militants' radical interpretation of Islam. After the age of 16 the boys are sent to a military camp, where they are given intensive training in the art of warfare and prepared for possible future as either front-line militia or suicide bombers. The images emerged as just weeks after ISIS released a video entitled 'The Blood of Jihad 2' - the second installment of a video series revealing life inside the group's training camps. The video is believed to have been filmed in the ISIS-held province of Nineveh in, Iraq. The highly choreographed video opens with dramatic slow motion shots of of young boys firing AK47s as they advance in a line. All the boys are seen wearing matching military camouflage fatigues and chequered headscarves. The first part of the film, which appears to be shot in soft focus and is set to music, then shows the boys undertaking training in martial arts. One of the boys can be seen holding the black flag of Islamic State whilst another of the boys, wearing a headband with a slogan in Arabic, leads the martial arts drill.

Sick: Adult Islamic State militants (pictured) have long groomed children to take part in their acts of terrorism . In October another set of images emerged purporting to show young Syrian children being trained at a military camp run by ISIS in the group's de facto capital Raqqa. The photographs showed children barely older than five being taught basic combat and survival skills, learning how to use enormous assault rifles, and being given lessons in extremist ideology. The disturbing images of the school, said to be named Al-Sharea, were shared online by Raqqa is Being Slaughtered Silently - a small activist collective which secretly documents the shocking violence and oppression the terror group has brought to their home city. According to the activist group, the Al-Sharea school is specifically run to provide militant training to young males under the age of 16. Its objective is understood to be to wildly distort the views of young Raqqa residents, creating an entire generation for whom the idea of Islamic extremism and acts of terrorism are second nature.

Pictured, an adult militant kicks a child in the leg during training . A report released by the United Nations in July documented more than 4,000 cases of children being recruited and used in conflicts last year - but said thousands more are estimated to have been forced to join armies and rebel groups around the globe . Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon's annual report on children and armed conflict adds Nigeria's notorious extremist group Boko Haram to the U.N. 'list of shame.' It now includes eight government forces and 51 armed groups that recruit or use, kill or maim, commit sexual violence or rape against children in conflicts, or attack schools or hospitals. The report said the recruitment and use of children in armed conflict remained prevalent in 2013 and those who commit grave violations against children, especially sexual violence, usually don't face justice. Leila Zerrougui, the special representative for children and armed conflict, told a news conference launching the report that advances by Islamist extremists in Iraq 'are creating extremely volatile and dangerous conditions for children.' She said the secretary-general has listed four new parties for recruiting and using children: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, al-Qaida affiliated Jahbat al-Nusra, the ultraconservative Islamic rebel group Ahrar al-Sham, and the Kurdish People Protection Units or YPG.","Children little older than 10 have been pictured at latest ISIS terror school .

"A new age traveller who became a wealthy wind farm tycoon was ‘abusive’ to his ex-wife when she asked for maintenance payments, a court has heard. Kathleen Wyatt said she feared Dale Vince would ‘become violent’ when she went to him begging for cash after being left on benefits with two children. She  to court 22 years after they divorced, claiming he rendered her destitute while he grew his business. Dale Vince: The wind farm tycoon, worth more than £100m, used to live in an old ambulance. His former wife  is suing him for £2m of his fortune . Left penniless: Kathleen Wyatt says she is demanding the money despite divorcing Mr Vince 22-years ago . The landmark case, which has now reached the Supreme Court, could have far-reaching consequences for men who have become rich after a divorce. Mr Vince left school at 15 and was part of a ‘Peace Convoy’ of hippies travelling around southwest England in the 1980s. The pair married in 1981 when they were both penniless travellers, living largely on state benefits. After their divorce in 1992, Mr Vince lived in an old ambulance he powered with a home-made wind turbine made from recycled materials. A strict vegan with shaggy hair and an earring, he was described in the Court of Appeal as ‘the most improbable candidate for affluence’. But in 1995, Mr Vince founded Ecotricity, which is now one of the UK’s biggest green energy companies and led to him being awarded OBE in 2004. Now worth an estimated £107 million, he owns a sports car and lives in the £3million 18th century Rodborough Fort, near Stroud, Gloucestershire, with his new wife and their five-year-old son. He also owns a football club, Gloucestershire’s Forest Green Rovers where he has banned red meat, and installed an organic football pitch, avoiding the use of chemicals and cut by a solar-powered lawnmower. Meanwhile Miss Wyatt, 55, says she is so poor that she has been travelling to hearings from her home in Monmouthshire by bus – and has been sleeping in a bus station. Her claim for maintenance was struck out by the Court of Appeal, but her lawyers are now challenging this decision in the Supreme Court. If she is successful, it will lead to a full hearing before a family judge who will decide whether any financial settlement is due. £3m hone: Where Mr Vince lives with his new wife and son . Yesterday, she said in statement read out to the court that she had waited this long to make her claim because she was afraid of her ex-husband. When they divorced, she was left to care for the couple’s young son and her daughter from a previous relationship, who Mr Vince treated as his own during their marriage. She said she had gone to Mr Vince in the early 1990s ‘desperate’ for money but had been ‘fobbed off’. She said: ‘He said he could not help because his business was too much of a strain on his resources. I didn’t know what to do so in 1995 I contacted the Child Support Agency (CSA).’ The CSA then began investigating the finances of Mr Vince, prompting him to become ‘abusive’, according to his ex-wife. Kathleen Wyatt (pictured right in 2003) said she feared Dale Vince (left) would ‘become violent’ when she went to him begging for cash after being left on benefits with two children . She added: ‘I couldn’t cope with the stress caused by him. I asked them to stop the assessment because I feared Dale would become violent towards me.’ The court heard Mr Vince’s finances improved ‘significantly’ after 1997 and continued to grow until the present day. He was worth an estimated £57 million in 2012, which rose to £107 million according to the latest figures. Philip Cayford QC, for Miss Wyatt, said: ‘We have no problem with that. It’s a remarkable story. The issue is whether the wife is entitled to a penny of that or not. ‘All the way through the 1990s and 2000s, she was clearly asking for assistance. It’s a sorry state that… in 2007 when the business was clearly flying and Mr Vince had had his OBE for three years, she wasn’t receiving a penny, and was having to borrow money from her son.’ Green energy entrepreneur Mr Vince is worth an estimated £107 million according to recent figures . Last year, senior family judge Lord Justice Thorpe said she had left her claim - amounting to around £100,000 for every year since she divorced him in 1992 - far too late. But Mr Cayford said yesterday: ‘This case should not have been struck out. We say the Court of Appeal, with the greatest respect, got this wrong.’ The court heard Miss Wyatt found a new partner in 1993 and had two more children with him – but that he subsequently did not finance the family either. Miss Wyatt was able to make the claim against Mr Vince because in family law cases, unlike in the civil courts, there is no time limit for a former spouse to bring a financial lawsuit. Neither kept any documents from their divorce and the solicitors’ files have long since been shredded. Davina Katz, Mr Vince’s solicitor and head of the family division at Schillings, said the case was significant because those who divorced young often did not resolve financial settlements if there was little wealth to share at the time. She told the Financial Times: ‘There are plenty of people who separated decades ago but have not got divorced or if they did get divorced at the time did not deal with financial claims and so this could have profound implications.’ The case, which is being heard by a panel of five judges led by Britain’s most senior female judge Lady Hale, is expected to conclude tomorrow.","Kathleen Wyatt said Dale Vince, 53, was 'abusive' when she asked for cash .

"Courtney Mitchell Lewis, 21, (above) of South Wales, took an overdose of slimming pills after his  loan spiralled from £100 to £800 in three months . A struggling student who died from an overdose after taking out a payday loan which spiralled from £100 to £800 in just three months, posted on Facebook prior to his death: 'I don't want to die.' Courtney Mitchell Lewis, 21, took an overdose of slimming pills after his short-term loan spiralled to eight times the amount he had borrowed. An inquest at Swansea Civic Centre heard how the physics undergraduate - known as Mitch to his friends - had taken out the loan while struggling for cash during his studies. The student, of Aberdare, South Wales, was working as a barman while studying at Swansea University but decided to use the payday loan company to borrow £100. Colin Phillips, acting senior Swansea coroner, said: 'Mitch was a loving and caring individual who was facing a number of personal problems. 'He had debts after taking out a £100 loan which had increased to £800 within just three months.' The company offering the payday loan was not identified at the inquest but it is understood that it was investigated by police and found to be operating legally. Following a night out with friends in May last year, Mr Lewis took pills he had bought as a slimming aid at his flat in Swansea and then posted a message to friends on Facebook saying: 'I don't want to die, I think it is too late.' His friends called the emergency services and he was taken to A&E but the inquest heard it was too late to save him. The inquest heard Mr Lewis had taken the tablets as 'a cry for help rather than a serious suicide attempt.' Mr Phillip ruled a verdict of misadventure at the hearing and said: 'Mitch took [the] tablets as a cry for help, but despite alerting friends who took him to hospital he died of toxicity.' An inquest at Swansea Civic Centre heard how the physics undergraduate - known as Mitch to his friends -wrote on Facebook prior to his death: 'I don't want to die, I think it is too late.' He died in May last year . The coroner recorded a verdict of misadventure and said Mr Lewis had taken the tablets as a 'cry for help' Mr Lewis was described as 'the man who always smiled' by his friends in university tributes. Former Students' Union President Luke James said: 'His friendliness made it a better place to be every day. 'It is obvious his unique impact on our university and so many people's lives will be felt forever.'","Courtney Mitchell Lewis took overdose of slimming pills at Swansea home .

"It is a bloom that has not been seen in London by the public for more than 100 years. But the sight of a rare white helliborine orchid is one the Queen is able to enjoy - as it is growing in her gardens at Buckingham Palace. And walking through the 40 acres of land that make up her green oasis, there are countless trees covered in plaques to show they have been planted by kings, queens, emperors, princes and princesses. The Queen, pictured with The Duke of Edinburgh at one of Buckingham Palace's summer garden parties, has given ITV unprecedented access to the 40 acres of land . Regarded as the Queen's private sanctuary where she is able to relax, and enjoy walking her corgis, the doors have finally been opened to the public through a special two part documentary which will be shown later this month on ITV. The Palace grounds are only partially opened for the Queen's annual summer garden parties which host up to 7,000 guests. However for the purposes of the programme, titled The Queen's Gardens, the film crew was given unprecedented access and the cameras are believed to have captured the resident urban foxes, and the Queen's 200,000 honey bees. Housed in four hives on a secluded island in the garden's lake to produce honey for the Royal family. The programme is presented by gardening expert Alan Titchmarsh who was thrilled to stumble upon the white helliborine. He said: 'This little white flower. It may not seem terribly spectacular but it's the sign of something very exciting. It was found growing here a year ago and before that it hadn't been discovered in London for over a century. The garden's 40 acres is enough for 22 football pitches and during her reign Her Majesty has ensured her grounds are a place where nature thrives . 'The helliborine orchid, normally a native of chalk woodland, miles away from here, it's a sign that this is one of the richest environments for hundreds of square miles around.' The garden's 40 acres is enough for 22 football pitches and during her reign Her Majesty has ensured her grounds are a place where nature thrives. It now plays host to 350 species of wildflower, 83 species of bird and two and a half thousand British species of insect, including butterflies. The Queen's head chef also uses mulberries from the 50 mulberry trees in the garden, which were planted by King James I. Mistletoe, hazel catkins and winter jasmine currently fill the beds of the gardens at Buckingham Palace, . Speaking to the Radio Times, Mr Titchmarsh said: 'If you wander off into the undergrowth, you'll find what is probably one of the finest collections of trees and shrubs in the country, including 35 different types of mulberry. The sight of a rare white helliborine orchid is one the Queen is able to enjoy - as it is growing in her gardens at Buckingham Palace . But it's a revelation to see just see how much wildlife there is – amazing bird and insect life and mammals – which for somewhere slap-bang in the middle of the city is unusual. 'I went every month for a year and saw it right the way through the seasons. It's size, scale and scope is much larger than ever you'd imagine – it really is a green lung and oasis in the middle of the city.' Equipment set up in a similar way to the BBC's popular Springwatch programme – nest-box, infra-red and motion-activated cameras, will reveal the types of wild flowers that bloom to fill the Queen's garden with colour and show how 50 species of bird, including kingfishers and woodcock, visit throughout the year. The Queen has a team of gardeners who ensure the grounds are beautifully maintained, and each Monday she is presented with a posy of what is growing. Explains Mr Titchmarsh: 'The gardeners are quite cagey talking about what the Queen likes, but what becomes quite evident is she loves what we would call English cottage garden flowers – unostentatious flowers, not things that are too exotic. The programme is presented by gardening expert Alan Titchmarsh who was thrilled to stumble upon the rare white helliborine orchid . 'She has a little posy cut for her every Monday, which is placed on her desk for when she arrives back from Windsor. It will typically have six or seven different types of flowers from the garden to give her a little snapshot of what's looking good at that time.' Titchmarsh added that the Queen is 'very much involved with major changes', saying: 'The summer garden parties were always in July, but now they have been moved slightly earlier to June that means adjusting the planting scheme to make the borders brighter earlier. 'She would be consulted about that sort of thing.'","Producers of ITV's The Queen's Gardens were given unprecedented access .

"Conservative minister Anna Soubry questioned David Cameron’s immigration policy – suggesting that he was in danger of stoking ‘false fear’ A conservative minister last night questioned David Cameron’s immigration policy – suggesting that he was in danger of stoking ‘false fear’. Anna Soubry, the outspoken defence minister, said she wanted to know why the Prime Minister has pledged to crack down on European workers claiming benefits. In a colourful interview, she said the Government should not be ‘pandering’ to the view of parties such as Ukip, and warned there was a risk of ‘playing to people’s prejudices’. The Prime Minister announced last month that he wanted to stem the flow of European migration by cutting in-work tax credits for EU migrants until they have paid taxes in the UK for four years. But Miss Soubry questioned whether people were really coming over here to sign on to benefits, asking: ‘Is that the real problem?’ The comments highlight differences in the Conservative ranks over immigration following the party’s failure to meet its promise to cut net migration to tens of thousands. Two weeks ago, figures showed net migration had risen by 78,000 over the past year to 260,000 – well above the 2010 figure of 244,000 – fuelled mainly by incomers from the EU. In a speech the day after the embarrassing figures were released, Mr Cameron unveiled plans to deny in-work benefits for EU workers for four years. These handouts top up low wages and are seen as a key ‘pull factor’ for incomers to Britain. Interviewed on Radio 4’s PM programme, Miss Soubry questioned Mr Cameron’s insistence that benefits were drawing people to the UK – claiming that migrants were really interested in jobs. She said: ‘I want to know and understand why my Prime Minister who I have huge amounts of respect for, I genuinely do, I think has done an outstanding job, I want to know why he’s come to that conclusion. Is that the real problem, that people might be able to claim benefits? There’s a danger that you create false fear and sometimes you play to people’s prejudices.’ She added: ‘It’s really important that we make it clear that the majority of people who come to our country come here to work these are good people. ‘Just because some people have a particular view, doesn’t mean to say that you should pander to it.’ This is not the first time Miss Soubry has made a controversial intervention. Last year she said Ukip leader Nigel Farage looked as though he has ‘a finger up his bottom’. The defence minister also had a run-in with Mr Farage on Question Time, when she told him: ‘You do not talk facts; you talk prejudice.’ The Prime Minister announced last month that he wanted to stem the flow of European migration by cutting in-work tax credits for EU migrants until they have paid taxes in the UK for four years . Yesterday she said several people had rung her to compliment her on tackling the Ukip leader. In her lively interview, she adopted a broad Australian accent as she spoke about a call she received from Lynton Crosby, the Prime Minister’s Australian strategy chief. She said: ‘The next day, my mobile went. I got, “it’s Lynton Crosby here… yeah, what you said last night, absolutely brilliant”. And I said: “Oh wow, great, thanks Lynton.” ‘The other person who rang me…was David Cameron, saying: “What you said last night… absolutely.”’ She went on: ‘The next person who said something…was Ed Miliband who actually came up to me the next night and said it was the right thing to say. And it was. We mustn’t ever forget that.’ Asked about Miss Soubry’s comments on the Government’s benefits crackdown, a Downing Street spokesman said: ‘The Prime Minister has set out a very clear plan to control migration from within the EU.’","Anna Soubry says the Government shouldn't be pandering to Ukip .

"Martin Howe, who is spearheading the group's claim, says he and 18 other Irish travellers suffered 'race discrimination' when a they were turned away from a Wetherspoon pub . A group of Irish gipsies are suing pub chain J D Wetherspoon for up to £100,000 over 'race discrimination' allegations after they were turned away from a pub. A top lawyer, a Catholic priest and a retired police inspector are among a 19-strong group of travellers who claim they were told they could not enter The Coronet, in Islington, North London, because they are gipsies. The group visited the pub after a meeting of the Irish Traveller Movement in Britain (ITMB) charity at their headquarters next door to the pub. The gipsies told Central London County Court that 'the doormen told them that they were not allowing travellers or people from the traveller conference to enter'. The case against JD Wetherspoon Plc is being spearheaded by Martin Howe, a partner in a leading law firm, Father Joseph Browne, a Catholic priest, and Mark Watson, a recently retired police inspector who served 30 years with the Cheshire force. They are seeking a declaration that they were the victims of racism, up to £100,000 in damages and a public apology. Wetherspoon vehemently denies discrimination and says the pub's entrance policy in force on the day had 'nothing to do with race.' Marc Willers QC, representing the travellers, told Central London County Court: 'The claimants seek a declaration and damages from J D Wetherspoon Plc in relation to the direct race discrimination which they allegedly suffered on November 17 2011. 'Put shortly, they contend that their treatment by J D Wetherspoon employees or agents constituted direct discrimination. 'They treated them less favourably than others because the claimants were Irish travellers, or associated with Irish travellers. 'The remedies sought by the claimants are a declaration and damages, including damages for injury to feelings and aggravated damages.' Setting the scene, the barrister said: 'Father Joseph Browne is the ITMB's chair. At the end of the conference, at about 4.30 pm, he invited the delegates to join him for a drink at The Coronet public house which was situated next door. 'When the first group of delegates arrived at 4.45pm ... the doormen told them they were not allowing travellers or people from the traveller conference to enter The Coronet.' The group claim they were not allowed into The Coronet in Islington, north London, by bouncers who were told not to allow Irish travellers in . J D Wetherspoon vehemently denies discrimination and says the pub's entrance policy in force on the day had 'nothing to do with race' Mr Willers said that Mr Watson, who was then a serving police officer but has since retired, produced his warrant card and asked if the manager would explain what was going on. At this point, the group claim that a third doorman appeared and explained that entry was barred because of problems after the same conference last year. The group were eventually allowed into the pub - on condition that Mr Watson 'vouch for' and 'keep an eye' on them - but later walked out and joined others waiting outside. Irish traveller Pauline Anderson, a trustee of the charity who works in primary education for Sheffield City Council, told Judge John Hand QC that being turned away 'upset' her. 'I was told that nobody from the conference could be allowed into the pub. The doormen were not allowing entrance to anyone who had been at our conference,' she said. 'They explained that they had their instructions from the management of the pub. I was not told that large groups would not be allowed in. 'I had a conversation immediately afterwards about how upset I was and still am.' Thomas Kibling, for Wetherspoon’s, pointed out that the group was allowed to enter after Mr Watson agreed to 'take responsibility' for them. Judge Hand has now reserved his decision on the case until a later date, following a 13-day hearing.","Irish travellers claim they suffered 'race discrimination' from pub bouncers .

"A former senior Chinese military officer would bribe officials by filling up a Mercedes with gold bars and simply handing over the keys, it is claimed. Gu Junshan, 57, former Lieutenant General in the logistics department of the People's Liberation Army, is alleged to have been part of a scam worth a staggering 30billion yuan (£3.1billion). Prosecutors claim he personally accepted about 600million yuan (£63million) in bribes himself, mainly for the alleged sale of hundreds of military positions. Midas touch: Former PLA Lieutenant General Gu Junshan would bribe officials by filling up a Mercedes with gold bars and simply handing over the keys, according to a recent magazine report in Hong Kong . Gu also loved gold, especially gold statues of Buddha, though he preferred receiving ground up gold rather than gold bars when he was taking bribes, according to a report in Hong Kong's Phoenix Weekly. The magazine is run by Hong Kong broadcaster Phoenix Television, which has close ties with the Chinese government. 'Gu got exactly what he wanted,' a person with knowledge of the probe told the magazine. Gu was first charged with corruption in March. His case is connected to Xu Caihou, who retired as deputy head of the powerful Central Military Commission last year and from the China's decision-making Politburo in 2012. Xu's graft probe was announced in June. Pheonix Weekly said Gu had powerful patrons, though did not name Xu directly, referring only to a person called 'X', Reuters reported. Gu's patron: Xu Caihou, who retired as deputy head of the powerful Central Military Commission last year, has also been charged with alleged corruption . It has not been possible to reach either for comment and it is not clear if they have lawyers. Gu is alleged to have shared much of the spoils of his scams with Xu, his superior, including giving a 20million yuan (£2million) debit card to Xu's daughter as a wedding present, the South China Morning Post reported. He is also accused of pocketing a 6 per cent kickback from a 2billion yuan (£200million) sale of military land . President Xi Jinping has launched a sweeping campaign against graft since becoming party chief in late 2012 and president last year, vowing to take down powerful 'tigers' as well as lowly 'flies'. He has made weeding out corruption in the military a top goal. China's People's Liberation Army is the world's largest military force, with approximately 2.285million servicemen and women. China's defence budget is the world's second biggest, estimated at between $120billion and $190billion a year annually. This is still dwarfed by the U.S., which spends at least three times as much by all estimates. Serving and retired Chinese military officers have said military graft is so pervasive it could undermine China's ability to wage war. The latest allegations have emerged days after reports that a woman major-general with a senior post at an army university was being investigated. Gao Xiaoyan, Communist Party boss of the discipline committee at the PLA Information Engineering University, was arrested on November 27 and her house searched and sealed off, financial news magazine Caixin said. She is suspected of taking bribes related to a construction project at a military hospital, added the report, which was widely carried by Chinese news websites. The purges comes as President Xi steps up efforts to modernise forces projecting power across the disputed waters of the East and South China Seas, though China has not fought a war in decades.","Gu Junshan alleged to have personally accepted £63million in bribes .

"They’re going to need a bigger boat. Incredible footage has emerged of a potential predator that has made itself at home in a small NSW coastal town. A three-metre-long great white shark has become the latest tourist attraction in the Lake Macquarie on New South Wales’ Central Coast, but is putting a serious dampener on swimming plans. There is much excitement about the new resident, who is now affectionately known as ‘The White’, and some locals have been seen engaging in some seriously alarming antics. Scroll down for video . Incredible footage has emerged of a shark swimming near Murrays Beach in NSW's Lake Macquarie . Residents have taken to affectionately calling the three-metre long great white 'The White' A cringe worthy video taken on Saturday shows enthusiastic locals trying to get ‘up close and personal’ and pat their new friend – an extremely questionable decision as they bob precariously on the water in an inflatable boat. As the shark circles the vessel, a woman can be seen seen leaning her entire torso over the side of a boat with her hand skimming the water. She attempts to pat the shark as its fin glides past just centimetres from her hand, cheering in delight as her friend is heard egging her on, yelling: ‘hey, give the shark a pat!’ The vision of her risky antics is even more unnerving due to footage taken just four days earlier which shows what is thought to be the same shark leaping around two metres into the air. The nerve-racking video shows a woman leaning right over the edge of her inflatable boat to try and pat and photograph the man-eater . The sharks fin is seen gliding through the water while the woman  hovers her hand mere centimetres away . Two gentlemen were fishing in a 14-foot tinnie near Pulbah Island when they first sighted the incredible creature and captured footage of it leaping into the air twice . Two gentlemen were fishing in a 14-foot tinnie near Pulbah Island when they first sighted the incredible creature. Although incredibly anxious at the sight of the shark, Rodney Collins and his brother-in-law Warren Sternbeck were amazed to see the big fish jump out of the water on two occasions. ‘We turned around and saw the water churning and then the shark surfaced,’’ he said. ‘‘I quickly pulled anchor and sped away because I didn’t know if it would jump in the boat. There were some choice words, it was a bit unnerving,’ Collins told Newcastle Herald. Another sighting of the man-eater at prompted council workers to erect shark warning signage at Murrays Beach the next day. A sailing meet for juniors in nearby Belmont was cancelled due to the shark’s ominous presence. There have been past shark spottings, including great whites, bull sharks and hammerhead sharks in the same salt water lagoon, which is connected to the ocean by the Swansea Channel. The lagoon is a tempting home for sharks as commercial fishing was banned from the waters in 2002.

"Iran is criticizing the U.S. and specifically the Obama administration for its 'racist' treatment of minorities. A statement released Sunday by Iran's Foreign Ministry calls for action to end the country's 'racist, inhumane crackdown on blacks' in the wake of the controversial grand jury decisions not to indict police in the deaths of both the Eric Garner and Michael Brown. Iranian Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman Marziyeh Afkham told the press America has to 'stop police brutality and racist and inhumane treatment of minorities and colored populations in the country.' Iranian Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman Marziyeh Afkham told the press America has to 'stop police brutality and racist and inhumane treatment of minorities and colored populations in the country' The deaths of Garner and Brown and the perceived failure of authorities to fairly seek justice has sparked protests and outrage nationwide. Free Beacon notes that Iran ironically is at the forefront of executing both children and political dissidents. 'It is expected from the U.S. administration and judiciary to comply with their duty and take lawful and just actions in dealing with their citizens and stop the practice of racism and inhumane behavior,' Afkham continued. Iran news organization FNA reported that the spokeswoman further demanded that 'U.S. administration [must] show respect for human rights and set aside its politically-tainted view on the issue. The deaths of Garner and Brown and the perceived failure of authorities to fairly seek justice has sparked protests and outrage nationwide . 'The U.S. administration has continuously criticized other countries and made an instrumental use of human rights and adopted double-standard criteria in the last few decades, while it has ignored domestic situation at home.' Far from having a moral high ground, it should be noted that Iran continually outrages human rights activists by reportedly torturing prisoners in cruel and unusual ways, setting them on fire or cutting off limbs.","Iranian Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman Marziyeh Afkham told the press America has to 'stop police brutality and racist and inhumane treatment of minorities and colored populations in the country'

"A middle-aged Tesco customer has been handed a restraining order banning him from being within five metres of a check-out girl after becoming 'irrationally fixated' with her. Photographer Nicholas Fenney, 56, developed a delusional view of his relationship with shop assistant Samantha Bryce, 22, after she served him in the store in Tetbury, Gloucester. A court heard he had given her a calendar of his duck photographs at her checkout in an envelope with her name on, and had sent her a 'disgusting' Valentines card with rabbits on, telling her he 'loved her'. Photographer Nicholas Fenney (left, in an old photograph) developed a delusional view of his relationship with shop assistant Samantha Bryce (right), 22, after she served him in the Tetbury store, in Gloucester . She told Gloucester Crown Court that the first time she spoke to him he had handed her the envelope, which was addressed to her by first and second name, but she had never told him her second name and he had spelt it incorrectly. Next time she saw him at her till he commented about the horse picture on her name badge and revealed that he knew she owned a grey horse, she said. 'That really freaked me out because my horse is a dappled grey but I had no idea how he knew that,' she said. 'I tried to ignore it. When the transaction was finished he presented me with a piece of white paper when I gave him his receipt. 'The paper had his contact details on it. I alerted my parents about him that night.' Her third encounter with him was some weeks later in early February when she got a text from a colleague telling her a Valentine card had arrived for her at work, she said. 'When I got to work I saw the card and it said ""Samantha Janssen"" on the envelope. It also said ""The petite blonde girl, half Danish."" 'I'm not Danish so I don't know where he got that from. Although it said Jansen I am the only petite blonde Samantha in the store. 'The card inside had a picture of rabbits in bed doing God knows what. I thought it was disgusting. The insinuation in that card made me feel sick to my stomach. 'It had ""I love you"" written in pencil at the bottom of the card,' A few days later, she said, she was told by her manager that Fenney had made a complaint to Tesco head office alleging he had heard staff calling her 'a mad b*tch' and a 'little sl*t' while reprimanding her. A court heard he had given her a calendar of his duck photographs at her checkout in an envelope with her name on, and had sent her a 'disgusting' Valentines card with rabbits on, telling her he 'loved her' at the Tesco store in Tetbury . But there had never been any such incident, she said. She had never been reprimanded or abused at work. The court heard that in his letter to Tesco Fenney said: 'We have been trying to date one another for six months without success and there are complex personal issues involved.' It was on hearing about his bizarre complaint that she called in the police and reported Fenney for stalking, she said. Fenney, who describes himself on his website as a photographer, desktop publisher and French translator, was prosecuted for harassing Ms Bryce between 1st Dec 2013 and Feb 4th 2014 and was convicted by magistrates earlier this year. But he appealed against his conviction to the crown court last Friday and his appeal was allowed - although the court said it accepted Ms Bryce's evidence and rejected Fenney's version of events. Judge William Hart said the court found Fenney to be a 'delusional' and fixated fantastist' but his behaviour had not amounted to the legal definition of harassment or stalking. Although the court allowed his appeal and quashed the harassment conviction it made a two year restraining order barring Fenney from contacting Ms Bryce in any way or going within five metres of her when shopping at the Tetbury Tesco. In evidence, Fenney had claimed that Ms Bryce had once shouted at him loudly across the store suggesting he should ask her out on a date . He claimed she had seen his name on his Tesco Clubcard and looked up his website. Next time he saw her she told him she liked his photos of ducks so he took her the calendar, he said. He denied putting her surname on the calendar, saying he did not even know her name at that time. Later, he said, she told him she was half Danish and when he put Janssen on the Valentine card it was just a guess at a Danish name. And he claimed he had heard an incident when she was being abused in the store and he found it 'genuinely alarming' so he wrote to Tesco to complain. Fenney, was convicted for harassing Ms Bryce. But he appealed against his conviction to Gloucester Crown Court (pictured) and his appeal was allowed - although the court said it accepted Ms Bryce's evidence and rejected Fenney's version of events . Fenney said her evidence about him talking to her about her horse was false and 'off the wall.' Allowing the appeal Judge Hart, who sat with two male magistrates, said: 'Samantha Bryce is 22. 'Any objective observer would describe her undoubtedly as an extremely physically attractive young woman. The appellant, by contrast, is an ordinary looking man in his mid-fifties. That is not said to complain or condemn - it is just a statement of fact. 'We found Ms Bryce to be a believable and compelling witness. ' He said the court totally rejected Fenney's claim he had heard Ms Bryce being called a b*tch or sl*t. 'It is impossible to understand how any member of staff could refer to her as a little sl*t,' said the judge. 'Her demeanour and personality as we judge it is quite the opposite of that. 'This was indicative of the appellant's delusional view of his relationship with her. We unhesitatingly prefer her version of events wherever it differs from his. 'However although we find that his conduct did result in fear and distress to Ms Bryce one could not properly say that this was persistent conduct of a severely oppressive nature. 'What he has done is undoubtedly unattractive and unreasonable but does not cross the line into torment. For those reasons we allow his appeal. 'We find him to be someone who has formed and who still has a completely irrational interest in this innocent young woman. 'He denies being fixated by this young woman but we have come to the view that unless he is subject to a restraining order he is likely to subject her to further conduct which will amount to harassment.'","Nicholas Fenney, 56, became fixated with shop assistant Samantha Bryce .

Data from 38 police forces across England and Wales reveals the extent of child crimes among young people, and shows that police held a total of 3,273 children aged under 13 for serious crimes last year (file picture) The data also reveals that police held a total of 3,273 children aged under 13 for serious crimes last year, including rape, sexual assault, robbery, kidnap and issuing death threats. Of those arrested, just one in five ended up in court and many were released without punishment. Others were reprimanded, given a caution or ordered to apologise to their victim. In London, a total of 29 children aged ten to 12 were questioned over alleged rape offences from April 2013 until March this year. Of those, three ended up in court. Metropolitan Police also held a total of 26 children of the same age bracket during the same period for sexual assaults, and of those, two were sent to court. In addition, 55 were held over criminal damage offences, but only four of those were charged and sent to appear at court. A total of 49 children of the same age range were also questioned over theft from a shop, and of those, five were charged and sent to court. In total, Met Police pulled in 638 ten to 12-year-olds during the 12 month period. Elsewhere in the country, Nottinghamshire Police arrested a total of 77 children, aged ten to 12, last year. Of those, 27 were charged while 21 were cautioned. The others were released without charge. The force arrested two youngsters on suspicion of rape offences, and ten over alleged assault offences.

Ministry of Justice figures reveal that more than 1,000 children aged ten to 12 have been taken to court in the last two years. Peter Cuthbertson, director of the Centre for Crime Prevention, told The Sun: 'The victims – usually other children – are hardly likely to feel better knowing the criminals got off because of their age.' Children under ten are not deemed 'criminally responsible' and cannot be charged. Instead, they can be given a local child curfew - which bans children from being in a public place between 9pm and 6am, unless accompanied by an adult - or a child safety order, which places the offender under the supervision of a youth offending team.","Total of 154 children aged 12 and under arrested for sex crimes last year .

"Two Burmese workers charged with the murder of two British tourists in Thailand  have pleaded . not guilty, their lawyer said on Monday. Zaw Lin and Win Zaw Htun are on trial for the murder of 24-year-old David Miller and the rape and murder of Hannah Witheridge, 23, on the island of Koh Tao in September. Police say DNA taken from the Burmese migrant workers, both aged 21, matched samples found on the victims. The pair initially confessed to the murders but later retracted their confessions, saying they had been made under duress. Scroll down for video .

Win Zaw Htun (left) and Zaw Lin (right) have pleaded not guilty to charges including murder . On Thursday, Thai prosecutors filed charges against the Burmese men ranging from conspiracy to commit murder and rape to . illegal entry. They were taken to court on the island of Samui . on Monday to hear the charges. 'They pleaded not guilty to all the charges today,' Thanu . Akekachote, a lawyer representing the pair, told Reuters. 'It is . my understanding that the court wants to speed this up given its . impact on tourism and international relations.' The investigation into the murders has been marred by allegations of police incompetence and torture. The suspects said they were beaten and threatened by police - allegations which police deny. Last week the head of the defendants' legal team said defense witnesses had refused to come forward because they were too scared to speak up on behalf of low-status migrant workers in a case which has garnered global attention.

Rights groups have accused Thai authorities of using the men as scapegoats. The two suspects were paraded in front of cameras after apparently making murder confessions, but it was reported that a Burmese embassy official later formally retracted their confessions amid allegations the pair were tortured. In November British detectives traveled to Thailand to review the police investigation into the murders after widespread criticism of blunders including allowing reporters to trample over the crime scene. On Saturday the victims' families said they had seen strong evidence against the suspects and expressed confidence in the case. David Miller (left), 24, from Jersey, and 23-year-old Hannah Witheridge (right), from Great Yarmouth in Norfolk, were found dead on a beach on the island of Ko Tao on September 15 . 'There is a great deal of detail and vast areas of investigative work which has been shared with us,' Witheridge's family said in a statement released through Britain's Foreign Office. 'We would like to stress that as a family we are confident in the work that has been carried out into these atrocious crimes.' Mr Miller's family has urged restraint from rights groups and the media while the court case unfolds. 'The support for the Myanmar suspects has been strong and vocal, but please do not jump to conclusions until you have considered the evidence from both sides in full,' Miller's family said in its statement.

"Three people have been killed and eight injured after a motorist hit a bear and stopped in the middle of a Florida road. Yoel Menendez, 44, Ricoberto Llanez, 43, and Alain Navarro, 46 were knocked down by an oncoming car when they got out of their vehicle to help a woman who had struck the 300-pound animal while driving her Cadillac SUV. Seminole Police Department spokesman Gary Bitner said the woman was driving on the two-lane Snake Road just inside Everglades territory when her vehicle hit the bear shortly before 7 p.m. Sunday. A helicopter was used to transport the victims to hospital from the scene of the crash on the Big Cypress Seminole Reservation . Three people were killed and several others were injured after an SUV crashed with a bear Sunday evening 15 miles north of Interstate 75 on Snake Road . Four people were transported by air and four people were taken by ground to Broward General Hospital, three were pronounced dead . He said it was after sunset and dark already by that time. 'Three people from a second vehicle got out and tried to help and all were struck and killed by a third vehicle,' Bitner said by telephone, adding events apparently unfolded quickly. 'We've never had an accident involving a black bear,' he noted. 'There are black bears throughout Florida and this is in the Everglades, so there absolutely are black bears in that area.' He added that 13 people in total were riding in the three vehicles and four were injured severely enough that they had to be taken by helicopter to a South Florida hospital. The unusual accident happened around 7 p.m. on Snake Road, a two-lane stretch of highway just north of I-75 on the Big Cypress Seminole Reservation, near the Broward County line . Three people were killed and eight others injured, four seriously, after a car hit a bear in the Everglades on Sunday night, police said . He said four others were taken by ambulances and two of the 13 weren't hurt, including the woman in the initial crash with the bear. The identities of those involved and the extent of their injuries weren't immediately available, he said, adding accident reconstruction experts were on the scene and details remained uncertain of precisely how events unfolded or the speed and make of the vehicles. He said at least two of the vehicles were going in opposite directions. 'They are still trying to figure everything out,' he said. Bitner said that location is on the approximately 50,000-acre Big Cypress Seminole Reservation, one of several tribal reservations scattered about Florida. An SUV struck and killed a black bear and another vehicle behind it stopped to help. Three people from the second vehicle were killed when a third vehicle crashed into the first vehicle, according to Gary Bitner of the Seminole Police Dept . Three were killed and several were injured after a chain reaction crash involving a bear . He said it was also in an area north of the Everglades' Alligator Alley. Asked about the bear, he said he had no information on its sex or age or any visible behavior at the time. Encounters with bears in populous Florida are reported sporadically. Last week, Florida wildlife authorities said they captured and killed a bear that was suspected of being the one that bit a woman on the arm last Wednesday walking her dog in the Orlando suburb of Lake Mary in central Florida. Authorities said they also capture d two of the cubs of that bear but one was killed in the process. They added the other cub was old enough to survive on its own and they planned to release it elsewhere. Black bears are known around Florida, but a crash with one is rare according to the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission .","Driver was behind the wheel of a Cadillac SUV when she struck the animal .

"A college fraternity has been suspended after throwing a 'Cripmas' party which flared up racial tensions on campus. The party, held by Clemson University's Sigma Alpha Epsilon (SAE) fraternity on Saturday, showed some white students throwing stereotypical gang symbols while dressed in bandannas, Tupac t-shirts and sporting fake 'thug' tattoos. The party was also reportedly attended by female students from several sororities. Photos from party-going students at the South Carolina school flooded social media and were accompanied by comments such as: 'Merry Cripmas to all, and all a hood night.' Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity at Clemson held a party on Saturday night where they threw stereotypical gang symbols and posted pictures on social media wishing a 'Merry Cripmas and to all a hood night' The frat party was also attended by female students from sororities. Pictured are two students at the party with 'thug life' written on their knuckles . The party, organized by several SAE members, was held off-campus at a private residence. 'Cripmas' appeared to be a reference to a primarily African-American gang, The Crips, founded in California. Clemson students responded in fury to the images on social media, tagging them with #merrycripmas and organized a protest on Sunday morning on campus. A protesting student posted a picture online of a group of frat boys throwing gang symbols, one dressed in a T-shirt with '$18 thug' written on the front. She added the message: 'And this ladies and gentlemen, is Clemson University.' However a few students appeared to defend the party, with one Clemson student tweeting: 'People have themed parties all the time, i.e. white trash? Why is everything getting turned into a race ordeal? Ridiculous. #ClemsonCripmas' Clemson University said in a statement to MailOnline that SAE chapter members, their alumni advisory board and the national headquarters decided to suspend all activity indefinitely following the inappropriate theme party. Several SAE members resigned from positions and have been suspended from the fraternity. An internal investigation is underway, the school said. A number of pictures from the party appeared on social media with Clemson students flashing stereotypical gang signs and one wearing a T-shirt with '$18 Thug' written on the front . Dozens of white students attended the off-campus party on Saturday with the gang theme which the university deemed inappropriate and condemned . Clemson University president, James Clements (right), speaks with students protesting the frat party which caused outrage for its perpetuation of stereotypes at a time of heightened racial tensions across the U.S. Clemson University president, James Clements, sent an email to students on Sunday, making clear that the party was not sanctioned by the university and such events will not be tolerated. Mr Clements wrote: 'At a time of year when our thoughts are turning to family, holidays and the start of a new year – all the things that unite us and bring us joy -- it is discouraging that so many events and issues are causing division and hurt, and making many students feel unwanted at this great university. 'It hurts to read disrespectful and just plain mean comments in social media. Last night’s ''Cripmas'' party, which the university did not sanction, raised more concerns about the campus climate. Clemson is better than this. He added: 'Everyone is entitled to his or her own opinion about events in Ferguson, Staten Island and the protest rallies that those events have spawned. Great universities are built on the free expression and exploration of ideas. But the free expression of opinion must not cross the line and become harassment or intimidation, just as rallies and protest marches must not cross the line to lawlessness.'","The party, held by Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity on Saturday off-campus, showed students throwing stereotypical gang symbols .

"The body that was recovered from a river in Prague this morning is that of  Briton Karl Law, who disappeared in the Czech capital last month. Mr Law, a 34-year-old father-of-one from Fareham, Hampshire, went missing on his cousin's stag do in Prague on November 15th. Today, his fiancée Amanda Collins confirmed that the body was that of Mr Law, despite family members' initial confusion over the clothing found on the body. Heartbreaking: The body of Karl Law (pictured with fiancee Amanda Collins) was found in the Czech capital . Discovery: The body of 34-year-old Karl Law, from Fareham, Hampshire, has been discovered in a river in central Prague, three weeks after he went missing . 'The body found on Sunday was Karl. I thank everyone for their support,' Ms Collins, who has son Lenny, three, with Mr Law, wrote on her Facebook page. The body was found in Vltava river, close to Jiraskuv Bridge in Prague's city centre on Sunday, but was so badly decomposed police said DNA tests were required . Mr Law, who would have turned 35 on December 4th, vanished during his cousin Lee Cross's stag party in Prague last month. His friends saw him for the last time on Saturday November 15th about 11:30 PM in Prague's Old Town. 'The man had been in the water for three to five weeks, and it is not possible to do a proper identification because of the body's condition,' Police spokesman Andrea Zoulova said. The body found  in the river Vltava in the Czech capital was severely decomposed and is estimated to have been in the water for three to five weeks, which could fit with Mr Law who disappeared on November 15th . It is not possible to confirm ID without a DNA test but family who have seen the clothes found on the body say that they do not match those Mr Law was wearing when he disappeared . Family say they do not believe the body is Mr La . 'But there is a very real possibility that it might be the missing British citizen which is one of scenario's the investigators are considering.' Mr Law's death was confirmed hours after his mother Sue arrived in Prague to join the hunt for her son. Relatives including Karl's brother Craig, 30, had put up posters on subway stations and lap-posts around the city to try and locate him. Ms Collins has told the couple's son Lenny that his father was away on a fishing trip on behalf is supermarket giants Asda. When the body was first discovered, Mr Law's cousin Steve Stock, who was called to Prague police to identify Mr Law's clothes, said he was convinced that it was not Mr Law as the clothes did not belong to his cousin. Tributes to Mr Law have been flooding in on the Facebook page 'Please help find Karl Law in Prague' since the news broke of his death . Bekki Piper wrote: 'Thinking of everyone that knew him, especially his son, heartbreaking news. RIP Karl.' Claire Short said: 'Thoughts with Karl's family friends, Amanda and her little boy.' Jeanette Muldoon wrote on Facebook: 'So sorry to hear the awful news. You as a family have done so much to find him. Your love for him is indisputable.' A post-mortem is being carried out to determine the cause of death.","Body found in river in central Prague could be missing Brit, says police .

"Tourists on safari in Kenya got a shock when they spotted a a 15-foot python eating a gazelle in one bite. The incredible footage was captured  on a game drive in the Masai Mara reserve, popular for sightings of big cats such as lions, leopards and cheetahs - but very rarely snakes. In the video, the huge snake can be seen slowly ingesting the antelope, finishing off with the creature's legs, before slithering away lethargically into a nearby stream. Scroll down for video . In the video taken in the Masai Mara reserve, the snake can be seen slowly ingesting the young antelope, finishing off with the creature's legs . The snake swells to several times its normal size as the gazelle begins to fill most of its body, while the python's tail remains curled around the part of the prey not yet eaten. In the video, a local guide can be heard explaining how the snake produces a substance as it eats which softens the animal and allows it to be digested. The footage was shot by holidaymakers Caron and Mark Steele, from Worcestershire, during a holiday in October. The couple were traveling with Natural World Safaris - a company specializing in bespoke holidays that allow guests to get up close and personal with some of the world’s most spectacular and elusive wildlife, whilst supporting local conservation projects. Tour guide Andrew Lenkume spotted the scene and pointed it out to the couple. Caron said that the likely scenario is that the gazelle went to the water to drink and the python reared out of the water and clasped its head in its jaw. She added: 'Using teeth in its jaw to hold on, the snake was probably dragged out of the water as the gazelle backed away trying to escape. The python would then have wrapped its body around the gazelle and squeezed the life out of it.' The Rock Python is the biggest snake in Africa, but is rarely spotted on game drives due to its ability to camouflage in the surrounding grasses. As they are so slow, the snakes usually eat smaller animals found in trees such as squirrels, or will occasionally drop out of a tree onto a larger creature, rather than attempting to stalk and catch it. The 15 foot snake swells to several times its normal size as the impala begins to fill most of its body, while the python's tail remains curled around the part of the prey not yet eaten . Most antelopes typically give birth in September and October, timed with the coming of the rainy season to increase the chances of the babies' survival. But the infants are regularly left alone for up to a few hours by their mothers, which more commonly sees them fall prey to hyenas and big cats. Even so, to witness any kill while on safari is considered extremely fortunate by the local tour guides. 'With the wonders of nature you are never sure what you may cast your eyes on, and it is not often that you get to witness such an event,' said Will Bolsover, managing director of Natural World Safaris. 'To see this in all its glory is a definite once in a lifetime experience.' Caron and Mark were staying at a nearby luxury site called Richard's Camp, a private conservancy with very few people which is especially remote and wild.

"One in six people in Britain may have been sexually abused, a government adviser has warned. Graham Wilmer – appointed by Theresa May to the controversial historic sex abuse inquiry – said there could be as many as 11 million victims in the UK. Mr Wilmer, who set up the Lantern Project charity to support victims, said the scale of abuse constituted a ‘national health epidemic’. Graham Wilmer was awarded an MBE by Prince Charles in January after years of campaigning for more support for sexual abuse victims . He said his estimation was based on ‘prevalence rates published by the Government’. Mr Wilmer, an abuse victim himself, told Sky News: ‘There are potentially about 11.7 million victims out there at the moment who have not disclosed, and many of those people will start to come forward in very significant numbers.’ ‘You are dealing with a massive, massive problem. From what we have seen, if you don't provide the right level of support and intervention to support people when they come forward you see very significant health problems, mental health and physical health, which have a direct cost to us as a society. ‘We look upon child abuse and it's impact now as a national health epidemic.’ According to Sky News, statistics show one in six boys under 16 have been sexually abused - for girls the figure is one in four. Meanwhile, children's charity the NSPCC estimates one in 20 children in the UK have been sexually abused. The Government's inquiry has been dogged with problems, mainly around finding a chairman, since it was announced in July. Mrs May has apologised to victims for failing so far to find a suitable person to fill the role. Baroness Butler-Sloss stood down as chairwoman in July amid questions over the role played by her late brother, Lord Havers, who was attorney general in the 1980s. Britain's Home Secretary Theresa May appointed Mr Wilmer to sit as an independent member of the inquiry into historic sex abuse . Her replacement Fiona Woolf, the then Lord Mayor of London, resigned in October following a barrage of criticism over her ''establishment links'', most notably in relation to former home secretary Lord Brittan. And last week a number of alleged victims of child sexual abuse have said they will withdraw from the inquiry into the issue unless the Government makes major changes to it, including extending the period of time it will cover to further back than 1970.","Graham Wilmer said 11.7m people may have been abused in the UK .

"Ecstatic at discovering she was pregnant, Hannah Sanders set off to drive to her parents’ house to tell them. But just 30 minutes after finding out she was expecting her first child, the 20-year-old was killed at the wheel of her Renault Clio in a collision with a pensioner’s car. Her fiance Lee Palmer, 26, a passenger in her car, died at the scene. The couple had just collected the keys to a new flat and were looking forward to a happy future together. Hannah Sanders, 20, had only just found out she was pregnant- and had just collected the keys to a new flat with her fiancé Lee Palmer (pictured together) - when the crash occurred on the B269 in Limpsfield, Surrey . Miss Sanders, from Oxted, Surrey, only discovered she was expecting a baby half an hour before the crash . In a heartbreaking interview after the tragedy, Miss Sanders’s mother Pat, 59, and father David, 52, a construction manager, told how they discovered the pregnancy when police gave them a printout of the messages their daughter had posted on an online forum for mothers-to-be. After taking a home pregnancy test and announcing the news, her last message at 1.15pm said: ‘I still won’t be 100 per cent convinced till I have like 30 lines lol x.’ Her mother said: ‘We couldn’t believe it. Hannah was so obviously thrilled and there were so many messages of congratulations – poignantly, some were even being posted after she’d died. ‘But then as news of the deaths spread, people began posting RIP condolences.’ An inquest at Surrey Coroner’s Court heard how Miss Sanders and Mr Palmer picked up the keys to their new home on the day they died – April 25 this year. It was raining when Miss Sanders lost control of her car on a corner and skidded across the road, straight into the path of a Toyota Hilux driven by Rita Heath at 1.45pm. Mrs Heath, 75, who will not face prosecution, told the inquest in Woking she saw the Clio ‘slide’ across the B269 road in Surrey, where the speed limit was 60mph, before the two vehicles crashed into each other. The fatal crash occurred in wet conditions on the B269 in Limpsfield, Surrey, on April 25 (file picture) ‘The motor came round the bend and slid across the road. I looked and thought, “My God, they are on my side of the road”.’ She said there was ‘no way’ she could have avoided the car, adding: ‘It was over in seconds.’ Assistant Surrey coroner Simon Wickens recorded a conclusion of road traffic collision in the deaths of Miss Sanders and Mr Palmer, both of whom sustained multiple injuries. Mr Wickens said: ‘Hannah was struggling to control her car at the time. It would have been a fast-moving incident. ‘There was very little more Rita Heath could do. In reality, we shall never know the reason Hannah lost control’. Speaking before the inquest, Miss Sanders’s mother said: ‘It’s tragic that she and Lee never got to tell us their wonderful news. They would have been so happy and excited. ‘Being a mum and marrying Lee was all Hannah ever wanted.’","Hannah Sanders found out she was pregnant 30 minutes before fatal crash .

"Unpopular opinion: Boston Globe columnist Stephen Kinzer (pictured) wrote a column published Thursday titled 'Joining the military doesn't make you a hero' As the nation remembered the deadliest attack against the American military in history, the Boston Globe sparked controversy by publishing a column against the hero-worship of our armed forces. Columnist Stephen Kinzer wrote a piece called 'Joining the military doesn't make you a hero' in which he argues that idolizing those who volunteer for military service is relatively new and distracts from the 'disgraceful' treatment of veterans. Kinzer's comments were generally ridiculed online, with many Twitter users furious that the opinion piece was published on the 73rd anniversary of the attack on Pearl Harbor - a military disaster which resulted in the loss of 2,402 American servicemen and led the U.S. to enter World War II. In his column, Kinzer writes that society has only recently started holding military members on a lofty pedestal, a development he believes is due to the military now being volunteer-only, which creates a 'small, self-contained caste' of soldiers 'cut off from the American mainstream'. Since Americans no longer lose their civilian husbands, brothers or sons to conscripted service, most are unaware of what war is like and Kinzer says that 'distance' leads to the development of 'extravagant fantasies about soldiers'. 'If we believe our soldiers are superheroes, it makes sense to send them to faraway battlefields to solve our perceived problems in the world,' Kinzer writes. Pointing to sporting events, where it has now become routine to bring a soldier out on the field or court at halftime for a salute to his service in Iraq or Afghanistan, Kinzer writes that these rituals feed 'the fantasy that military service turns one into a better, more selfless human being'. While Kinzer says it is justified to admire soldiers who have performed brave acts, he critiques the idea that a uniform 'automatically' turns 'ordinary people into giants'. Scroll down for tweets . Doesn't agree: Iraq war veteran and champion logroller J.R. Salzman was one of the man on Twitter to voice outrage over Kizer's opinion piece. Pictured on the left with President Obama in 2007, when the then-senator was running for the White House . Ultimate sacrifice: Salzman lost most of the right hand when his vehicle was struck by an IED in Iraq in 2006 . Kinzer says there are plenty of other heroes outside the military, like nurses, teachers and community organizers who deserve equal praise. He adds that this kind of idolatry distracts from the way 'scandalous' way veterans are treated, citing high rates of unemployment, mental illness, homelessness, addiction, and suicide among retired servicemen . 'The soldier acknowledging cheers at a ball game is a fantasy figure we can easily admire. Veterans in need are more disturbing, so we keep them invisible. If we truly considered our uniformed fighters heroic, we would show them real gratitude rather than the phony kind that gives us a shiver of momentary pride but does them little good,' Kinzer writes. The article didn't receive a very warm welcome online, as several Twitter users, including a few veterans, lashed back at Kinzer for his opinion. Iraq War veteran and champion logroller J.R. Salzman, who lost part of his right arm in 2006 after his vehicle was struck by an IED, was one of the first to respond, writing: 'According to Stephen Kinzer, being a community organizer is on par with being a soldier shipping off to war.' Others felt Kinzer's piece was inappropriate to publish the column on a day the nation was mourning the Pearl Harbor attacks. 'You're seriously defective and f***** in the head if you choose today to s*** on the military. Seek help,' one impassioned Twitter user wrote. However, some Twitter users did write that Kinzer made compelling points in his argument that turning soldiers into superheros fuels the American war machine. Before becoming a columnist for the Boston Globe, Kinzer spent more than 20 years working for the New York Times as a foreign correspondent. During his time at the Times, Kinzer covered stories in Central America, Eastern Europe and Turkey. Kinzer also teaches international relations at Brown University and contributes to The Guardian and New York Review of Books.

"A former guard at New York City's Rikers Island faces trial Monday on a federal charge that he deliberately ignored the medical needs of a mentally ill inmate who died after swallowing a corrosive disinfectant. The trial of Terrence Pendergrass, who prosecutors say was the captain on duty when Jason Echevarria swallowed a so-called soap ball in 2012, comes amid growing calls for reform at Rikers, one of the world's largest jail complexes. The case was brought by Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara, who has been among those calling for changes at Rikers, which houses some 11,400 inmates on an average day. Going to court: Terrence Pendergrass is charged with deliberately ignoring a mentally ill prison inmate as he screamed for help after eating a ball of caustic soap . Prosecutors said that in August 2012, a new guard who was unaware of rules requiring soap balls to be diluted in water gave one to Echevarria to clean up sewage flooding his cell. Echevarria swallowed the ball, which contained highly caustic ammonium chloride, charging documents said. Other inmates heard him banging on his cell door, vomiting and screaming for medical help, the documents said. Pendergrass was told about the situation by two guards, one of whom had learned from a pharmacy technician that Echevarria could die without help, authorities said. But Pendergrass failed to arrange for medical care for Echevarria, who was found dead the next morning, charging documents said. Pendergrass, 50, faces one count of deprivation of rights under color of law, which is punishable by up to 10 years in prison. Pendergrass has pleaded not guilty. His lawyer, Sam Braverman, declined comment. Victim: Jason Echevarria swallowed a so-called prison soap ball made of corrosive ammonium chloride in 2012 and died in agony allegedly because Pendergrass failed to act by getting him medical attention . Echevarria's father, Ramon, has sued the city for $40 million over the death. 'It is extremely obvious that he should have been afforded medical care,' Ramon Echevarria's lawyer, Robert Kelner, said Friday. The city denies the allegations. The federal case against Pendergrass comes during a time of increased scrutiny at Rikers, a massive jail complex that Mayor Bill de Blasio has described as deeply troubled and in dire need of reform. In August, federal attorneys in Manhattan released a scathing review of juvenile facilities at Rikers, finding guards regularly violated the constitutional rights of 16- to 18-year-old inmates by using excessive force. And last week, the mayor announced the recommendations of a task force called after a series of reports by The Associated Press detailing problems at Rikers, including the gruesome deaths of two seriously mentally ill inmates. De Blasio plans to spend $130 million over four years to improve the conditions for the mentally ill, diverting many of them away from jail altogether.  Nearly 40 percent of the roughly 11,000 daily New York inmates have a mental health diagnosis.

"A Falklands veteran with terminal lung cancer has been told to report back to a Government work programme 'when he's feeling better'. Amputee Gordon Lang, 62, from Gosport, Hampshire, said he was shocked to receive a letter from the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) urging him to find a ‘suitable job’ after he claims he told them he was dying. Until 2012, the ex Royal Marine worked as a steward at HMS Sultan, before losing his leg through illness - forcing him onto Employment and Support Allowance. Amputee Gordon Lang, 62, from Gosport, Hampshire, said he was shocked to receive a letter from the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) urging him to find a ‘suitable job’ after he told them he was dying . But earlier this year, his £600 benefits were cancelled  when he was assessed by Atos, the Government-appointed private company behind fitness-to-work tests, and told he could return to employment. The divorcee father -of-one, who was on RFA Sir Galahad when she was hit in the Falklands and also served in Northern Ireland, was in the process of appealing that decision at tribunal when his lung cancer was discovered. He claims he then told the government work programme - run by the Shaw Trust charity - about his cancer diagnosis, only to receive a response saying: ‘When you feel fit and ready for work we look forward to working with you to find a suitable job.’ Shaw Trust insist they were not told how serious Mr Lang’s illness was prior to sending the letter, and the war veteran has since been put back on Employment and Support Allowance. But Mr Lang, who has not been told how long he has to live, said: ‘I feel not only betrayed but criminalised for being ill. Mr Lang, who has not been told how long he has to live, said he feels criminalised for being ill . ‘I’ve been at work since I was 10 years old - that’s 50 years in the work place. ‘If I hadn’t lost my leg I’d still be at work now. ‘I’ve never shirked in my life.’ Shaw Trust in Portsmouth, which administers the work programme, wrote the letter to Mr Lang saying they noted he was not well. Mr Lang says that was sent after he gave them a medical note when he first fell ill and told them about his terminal condition. Richard Dickson, Gosport and Alverstoke branch president of the Royal British Legion, said: ‘It’s a tragedy that those who are there to look after the welfare of our ex-servicemen are totally out of touch. ‘They’re more interested in purse strings than doing what’s right for somebody experiencing great difficulties. ‘I would like to see that somebody has an ounce of humanity in their body to look at exactly what this man needs.’ In a statement, Shaw Trust spokesman Joel Charles said: ‘At no point were we advised about the seriousness of Mr Lang’s condition. ‘We wrote to Mr Lang on November 20 to acknowledge that we had received his medical certificate and confirm that he would receive no further contact from Shaw Trust during this period of time. ‘Now that we are aware of all the circumstance, our thoughts are with Mr Lang during this difficult time.’ The not-for-profit firm delivers the work programme for Maximus, which took over from Atos as the DWP’s contractor for work assessments. A DWP spokesman added: ‘We are hugely grateful to Mr Lang, as we are of everyone who serves our country.’","Gordon Lang lost his leg in 2012 - forcing him on to employment benefits .

"Nestled among moss-covered rocks, these forgotten pillboxes, gun batteries and tank traps are forlorn reminders of how drastically Britain's coast changed to stop a Nazi invasion. Many of the Second World War defences captured by photographer Marc Wilson now blend in with their surroundings, dangling precariously over the sea or being split in two by the forces of nature. Mr Wilson, 46, travelled 23,000 miles to photograph 143 forgotten coastal relics across Britain, as well as northern France, Denmark, the Channel Islands, Belgium and Norway. Forgotten: Photographer Marc Wilson has documented the abandoned war defences littering Britain's coast. Left: Studland Bay in Dorset, where a full-scale D-Day rehearsal took place in April 1944. Right: Concrete tank defences in the forests near Lossiemouth, Moray . Moss: Long since abandoned, the 1892-built Verne Battery on the Isle of Portland in Dorset stored field guns and housed ammunition in preparation for the D-Day landings. It also became an anti-aircraft artillery battery. Portland stone was used to build the Cenotaph in Whitehall . He researched the sites meticulously on the internet - and once he got there, he often found the places he was photographing were not even well-known among  locals. Mr Wilson, a father of one from Bath, told MailOnline: 'I've been a photographer for 15 to 20 years and I'd often come across military topics in my work. Like most people in England my family has a wartime history and I decided it was something I wanted to look at more closely. 'My family came from Poland, Romania and Switzerland so they were all caught up in the conflict. Another member of my family flew in the RAF. Somehow, as a photographer, I think this is my act of remembrance. 'I started with a simple Google search and moved on to literature and other sources to find the wartime remains. 'Some of them are very well-known but others were a lot harder to find. It was important to me to find more subtle ones, which people either didn't know about or which blended into the landscape.' Camouflage: A pillbox among rocks at St Michael's Mount, Cornwall, a strategic defence since the time of the Spanish Armada. In 1940, it was again garrisoned and fortified with a light anti-aircraft battery and three pillboxes made deliberately to blend with their surroundings . Left: Essex's Dengie peninsula had to be  defended, as it would have offered invaders a short passage to London bypassing the Thames and the Medway. Right: In Studland Bay, wartime defences have become overgrown and almost completely hidden by trees near the water line . Cracked: The elements had hewn this German defence in two at Wissant, northern France. The Nazis believed the Allies would regard Wissant, the closest point on mainland Europe to the English coast, as an ideal beach for an invasion. This defence was removed in 2013 . For one shot, a never-used pillbox by the sea in Dorset's Studland Bay, the tide had to be just high enough to touch the concrete base - but not high enough to drown Mr Wilson. 'It was viewable from a beach but it wasn't easy,' he said. 'I had to do a lot of research. A fully high tide would've cut me off completely and once I had the shot it was a case of grabbing my tripod and running.' Another image, shot from the site of the D-Day landings in northern France, shows the temporary harbour structures which allowed the landings to happen 70 years ago and which still float undisturbed within sight of the coast. At St Michael's Mount in Cornwall, a pillbox appears almost completely camouflaged among oblong grey rocks on an overcast day. In Portland, Dorset, Mr Wilson captured the Verne Battery - built in 1892 beside what would be the world's largest man-made harbour. Used in the First World War, it was expanded after 1939 and used to house ammunition used in the D-Day landings. And in Lossiemouth, Moray, a line of concrete anti-tank defences are themselves covered in moss, stretching to the horizon through the forest along a line  sliced through the trees. Grim: This fortification at Abbot's Cliff, part of the famous white cliffs of Dover in Kent, would have been a crucial lookout for enemy planes . Striking: On the other side of the Channel, at Arromanches les Bains, the British built a floating harbour which was used for ten months, landing 2.5 million men, 500,000 vehicles and 4 million tonnes of supplies. It can still be seen today as distant black specks in the water . Travelling far and wide: Flekkeroya, Norway (left), where German soldiers built a huge coastal fortress preventing Allies from using the Skagerrak - the stretch of sea between Norway and Denmark. Mr Wilson (right) travelled 23,000 miles for his project and spent £16,000 . Some of the locations are no longer in sight - either submerged by the shifting sands and waters or by more human intervention. Some, especially on the continent, were destroyed by the governments of the countries Mr Wilson was visited. Others are barely visible - blending into the landscape so well that it is a struggle to see them. The £16,000 project was made possible after almost half the total was raised through online crowdfunding. Mr Wilson thanked the donors, adding: 'It was incredible to get the funds. I think it's a subject matter that touches everyone, and that made me realise how important it was to follow through with the project'. The images, which first appeared in a touring exhibition last year, are now being published together for the first time in Mr Wilson's book, The Last Stand. Mr Wilson added: 'These man-made objects and zones of defence now sit silently in the landscape, imbued with the history of our recent past. 'Some remain proud and strong, some are gently decaying. Many now lie prone beneath the cliffs where they once stood. 'Whilst I capture the individual beauty of these objects in their landscapes, the series of photographs becomes much more than a set of traditional landscapes. My aim is that the collection will become a permanent photographic record of the past.' The Last Stand (2014) is published by Triplekite and is available for £35.","Marc Wilson, 46, travelled 23,000 miles to photograph 143 sites in Britain, France, Denmark, Belgium and Norway .

"Aston Massey, 23, finally has the figure she has dreamed of for 20 years with her fourth boob job - after her first fake breast exploded . A woman disfigured by childhood burns finally has the figure she has dreamed of for 20 years with her fourth boob job - after her first fake breast exploded. Aston Massey, 23, from Carshalton, Surrey, was badly scarred when she poured boiling water over herself at the age of three and a build-up of scar tissue meant she was left with lopsided breasts. She had a mastectomy at the age of 21 in June 2012 and her first right breast implant was successfully fitted in October 2012. But when she had further surgery to fit a new nipple five months later she contracted a blood infection and the implant travelled up her chest and pressed on her collar bone before bursting one night as she slept. More than a pint of pus leaked from a gaping hole in her boob and Ms Massey had to be rushed to hospital. 'My whole boob was like one giant spot just waiting to be popped and part of me wanted it to,' said Ms Massey. 'There was so much pressure I thought it might burst at any moment. My breast had swollen so much that even a sneeze could have caused it to explode. 'I remember shouting to my sister: 'My boob's exploded!' It sounds quite funny now, but at the time I was really panicking.' The support worker for disabled people rejected two further NHS implants in August 2013 and February 2014, but she finally underwent a successful operation in September this year. After years of struggling to fit an A-cup bra Ms Massey is now a C-size and plans to have a nipple tattooed on her new boob to complete the transformation. 'I never imagined I'd have to go through so much, but I don't regret a minute of it,' she said. 'I've been dreaming about having a normal pair of boobs for as long as I can remember, and no matter how much surgery I have to go through, I'll do it to achieve my dream.' WARNING GRAPHIC CONTENT . The support worker for disabled people rejected two further NHS implants in March and August 2013, but she finally underwent a successful operation in September this year . She was scarred for life after climbing over a baby gate at home and pulling a pot of boiling potatoes on top of her. After her first breast implant surgery 18 years later her boob exploded when she caught an infection brought on by capsular contracture. This is a common complication in breast augmentation surgery where the body forms a hard capsule of scar tissue around the implant and it has to be removed. In August 2013 she had reconstructive surgery for a second time but a few weeks after the implant was put back in she caught another infection. She had a mastectomy as soon as she turned 21 (right) and her first right breast implant in June 2012 to correct the imbalance, but her new breast swelled to four times its normal size and burst (right) Just six months later she had another implant fitted but was left devastated when it was again rejected by her body. She had her final operation in September this year to fit a new implant as scar tissue caused by the blood infection had caused it to be pushed up her chest. 'I'm absolutely delighted that I have got over all of these issues,' she said. 'Because it went so well at first I didn't really think that anything bad might happen, especially because I was so young. 'I am just happy that I have finally got over that hill and can start to look forward.' Infection and bleeding are relatively rare after breast implant surgery. But if you are having an implant fitted for breast reconstruction after a mastectomy (breast removal), you may have a greater risk of infection and bleeding. Most infections can be treated using antibiotics. But if your breast becomes severely infected, you may need to have the implant removed to prevent further complications developing. You should be able to have the implant reinserted after the infection has cleared up. Some research suggests the risk of infection and bleeding may be increased if you smoke because your wounds will take longer to heal. Surgeons may recommend not smoking before your operation to reduce the risk of developing complications. Some of the problems that can occur as a result of having breast implants fitted include: . Within four weeks of her first operation operation she contracted a blood infection and the implant travelled up her chest and pressed on her collar bone before bursting one night as she slept .","WARNING GRAPHIC CONTENT: Aston Massey, 23, was badly burnt aged 3 .

"Councils in England are demanding greater powers to veto new betting shops, and cut the high stakes on addictive roulette machines. The powerful Local Government Association said councils were ‘frustrated’ by the proliferation of bookmakers, which they blame for problem gambling and anti-social behaviour. They are calling for tough new powers to tackle ‘clustering’ of betting shops and reduce the risks from Fixed Odds Betting Terminals (FOBTs) which have been dubbed the ‘crack cocaine’ of gambling. Councils in England are demanding greater powers to veto new betting shops, and cut the high stakes on addictive roulette machines . There are already more than 30,000 FOBT machines in the UK. Research published last week, funded by the industry, conceded that high stakes gambling impairs players’ decision-making and could cause them to spend beyond their means while on a losing streak. The LGA, which represents all English councils, is calling for a new ‘cumulative impact test’ which would allow planners to reject applications for new betting shops if there is already a cluster of them. They also call for licencing laws to be updated to include betting, so officials can take issues of problem gambling and anti-social behaviour into account when considering applications. And lastly, they say the current £100-a-spin maximum stake should be brought in line with maximum stakes for other gambling machines, which is £2 in pubs and £5 in casinos. The intervention comes after 93 English councils submitted individual requests to reduce the maximum stake and reject applications, for ministers to consider under the Sustainable Communities Act . Tony Page, the LGA’s Licensing Spokesman, said: ‘Councils are not anti-bookies but many are frustrated by limited powers available to them to act on community concerns and limit the number of shops opening up in their area. ‘A new cumulative impact test would rightly give councils the power to veto new shops in areas already saturated by betting shops if firms can’t prove a new shop would benefit the local economy.’ The intervention comes after 93 English councils submitted individual requests to reduce the maximum stake and reject applications, for ministers to consider under the Sustainable Communities Act. The case for councils to tackle problem betting has become more urgent since it was recommended that Scotland be given far-reaching powers to tackle betting stakes and clustering of shops. Mr Page said: ‘Concerns about betting shop clustering and proliferation of high-stake FOBTs do not stop at the border. English councils must be handed the same powers.’","There are already more than 30,000 FOBT machines in the UK .

One message, from November 1, allegedly sent by Miss Bolter states: 'I love u and miss u and think u r sort of perfect...' On November 2 a text said: 'I love u bird and wish u let me look after u. Hope u feel better xx.' And a message sent on Novermber 9 said: 'I am really missing u bird...' Miss Bolter denies any romantic or sexual contact. The row is a major blow for Ukip leader Nigel Farage who has battled to show he has improved the professionalism of his party. 'Dinner invitation': Labour defector Natasha Bolter has now quit UKIP claiming she was sexually harassed by a senior official . Roger Bird today released details of these text messages sent to him by Miss Bolter to the Telegraph, which he says proves they had a 'consensual' relationship . The 35-year-old, who is of mixed race, yesterday pulled out of hustings in South Basildon, where she was expected to be selected as parliamentary candidate in the winnable seat, which is currently held by the Tories. Miss Bolter said: 'He asked if we could continue the interview at the Oxford and Cambridge Club that evening. 'I thought it was because I was nervous. [But] when I went I could see that he wasn't really interested in what I had to offer as a politician. 'He took me down to the snooker room and said, 'I find you very attractive'. He said: 'Would you like to come home with me?' Ukip suspended Mr Bird last night 'following allegations of impropriety... with regard to candidate selection'. Neil Hamilton, the former Conservative MP who is now Ukip's deputy chairman, has been parachuted in as a last-minute candidate for South Basildon. Mr Bird, 41, today claimed that he had a consensual relationship with Miss Bolter. He told the BBC: 'We were in a relationship briefly, but that relationship developed well after she had been admitted to the approved candidates list, so her selection was not connected to that.' He later told The Telegraph: 'I am going to make my case. Everything I am saying is backed by emails and text messages. There are plenty of emails and text messages between us which how it was a consensual relationship with interest on both sides. 'I have done nothing wrong. I am a single man, she is also single, we are both single people who conducted a consensual relationship outside the office. 'I'm very sorry that a story like his should have arisen because it detracts from our [Ukip's] central messages. The party had to respond in a formal way and conduct an appropriate investigation.' Miss Bolter defected to Ukip from Labour in September – a move that was seen as a huge coup for the party. She claimed that Mr Bird continued to try to sleep with her after she told him that she was not interested. The Times said that in October he invited her for a second time to visit the Oxford and Cambridge Club, where membership is limited to those who attended the two universities. 'He asked me to pop into his office first at 5pm. If the general secretary of the party rings you and says that, you go,' Miss Bolter said. Allegations: Ukip general secretary Roger Bird, 41, pictured with Dartford candidate Elizabeth Jones, has been suspended over the claims . She claimed that because she was wearing jeans and was not smart enough to eat at his club, Mr Bird bought her a £169 Ted Baker dress and shoes, telling her she 'now looked like a girl who could get in a taxi'. She claimed that at this second meeting, after a heavy meal, Mr Bird 'leant over and tried to kiss me'. 'It was obvious that he wanted to sleep with me,' she said. 'He said, 'I can help you, I'm supporting you'. 'I was quite adamant that I'm not going to sleep with him or anyone [in Ukip]. It's hard enough for women. We shouldn't have to sleep with people to get to the right place.' Miss Bolter said she left feeling 'very upset' and complained to party officials, who began an investigation that led to Mr Bird's suspension last night. She also alleged there was a catalogue of racism and sexism in the party and said she was told by another candidate that her only job was 'to look pretty and to get us votes'. On another occasion a local party chairman allegedly told her that a woman with a young baby was a 'f***ing Pole' who 'hasn't worked out the benefits system and how to get a free pushchair'. Last night, Ukip did not respond to messages from the Daily Mail. A spokesman told The Times that it would not comment on the allegations. He said the first knowledge the party had that anything was wrong was on November 5. Ukip suspended Mr Bird last night 'following allegations of impropriety... with regard to candidate selection'; pictured above is the party's leader, Nigel Farage, as he arrived for a radio interview last week . An internal inquiry was started the next day and Mr Bird was suspended following the submission of a 'draft report' by external consultants on 7 December. The spokesman said: 'The UK Independence Party took action swiftly and decisively, including steps involving external human resources consultants, as well as following due process and the party's constitution to the letter . . . [Ukip] will not tolerate impropriety of any kind amongst its staff. 'Unfortunately, Ukip has had to suspend Mr Bird pending a full investigation into allegations made against him.' Mr Bird was a Tory councillor in Wandsworth, South London, before leaving the party in 2009. He joined Ukip the next year. Prior to entering politics he was an auditor. He has been general secretary of the party since July 2014 and is also the party chairman for the South East of England. It is understood the allegations do not relate to any potential illegality and police are not involved. Mr Bird declined to comment to The Times.","Natasha Bolter claims Ukip general secretary Roger Bird propositioned her .

"Disability campaigners yesterday demanded new laws for wheelchair users after judges ruled they have no legal priority to use reserved areas on a bus. Appeal judges said that a mother with a baby buggy was within her rights to occupy a bus wheelchair bay, leading to a disabled passenger being left behind at the stop. The state-funded Equality and Human Rights Commission, which had brought the case of disabled passenger Doug Paulley to court, said: ‘This judgment means a wheelchair user has no effective legal rights if unable to gain access to a bus because a traveller blocks the designated wheelchair space.’ Bus companies do not have to force parents with pushchairs to make way for wheelchair users on buses, the Court of Appeal has ruled. It comes after an appeal by operator First Group, which had been ordered to pay £5,500 damages to wheelchair user Doug Paulley (pictured) Mr Paulley was denied access to a bus in February 2012 after a woman with a sleeping baby refused to move . Its disability commissioner Chris Holmes added: ‘The Commission will study the judgments before deciding whether to support an appeal for legislative changes to make sure disabled people can use bus travel.’ The case came after Mr Paulley was told he could not board a bus after a woman refused to move her buggy and make room. A judge at Leeds County Court ruled the bus company, FirstGroup, was in breach of its duty under the Equality Act 2010 to make reasonable adjustments for disabled people, and awarded £5,500 damages to Mr Paulley. But this decision suggested the needs of wheelchair users ‘trumped all other considerations’, one of the appeal judges said yesterday. Lord Justice Lewison, sitting with Lady Justice Arden and Lord Justice Underhill, said there was no law which says bus companies must force selfish passengers to make space for a wheelchair. Instead, they ruled that the 'proper remedy' for wheelchair users to get improvements in such cases is to ask Parliament. But Lady Justice Arden, sitting with Lord Justice Lewison and Lord Justice Underhill at the Court of Appeal (pictured), unanimously allowed an appeal by First Group . Common decency meant other passengers should move from the wheelchair space 'if that was possible', or drivers should instead ‘persuade’ passengers to do the right thing. But, in law, the needs of wheelchair users did not 'trump all other considerations'. Lord Justice Lewison said: 'The judge seems to me to have thought that the needs of wheelchair users trumped all other considerations. Mr Paulley, 36, from Wetherby, West Yorkshire, tried to catch the number 99 to Leeds in February 2012. The driver asked him to wait before getting aboard because a woman with a pram was in the wheelchair space, and asked her to fold the buggy. She replied that the buggy did not fold, and refused to move. The driver then left Mr Paulley behind because he did not think there was a safe place to secure his wheelchair on the bus. Lord Justice Lewison said the case was ‘not about whether non-wheelchair users should move out to accommodate a passenger in a wheelchair. Of course they should if possible.’ Drivers should instead be taught to pile pressure on selfish passengers, Lady Justice Arden said. They should even refuse to move off from the stop if passengers block disabled customers, she added. Lord Justice Underhill said: 'It has to be accepted that our conclusion and reasoning in this case means that wheelchair users will occasionally be prevented by other passengers from using the wheelchair space on the bus. The judges ruled that common decency meant other passengers should move from the wheelchair space 'if that was possible'. But, in law, the needs of wheelchair users did not 'trump all other considerations' 'Sometimes there will be a reasonable justification for that happening, but sometimes there will not. 'I do not, however, believe that the fact that some passengers will - albeit rarely - act selfishly and irresponsibly is a sufficient reason for imposing on bus companies a legal responsibility for a situation which is not of their making and which they are not in a position to prevent. 'In the present state of the law something must still be left to the good sense and conscience of individuals.' Lady Justice Arden added: 'It follows from the judgments of this court that the proper remedy for wheelchair users is to ask Parliament to strengthen the powers of bus drivers so that they could, for instance, require people to vacate the wheelchair space, or create new duties on other passengers, or to campaign for a different design of buses. 'In that way, a greater number of wheelchair users would be able to use the wheelchair space.' The judge said she did not underestimate the difficulties of travel for wheelchair users 'or their frustration at the pace of change'. February 24, 2012: Doug Paulley, was prevented from travelling on a First Group bus to Leeds. The driver refused to make a mother with a pushchair leave the space because it would wake up her baby . September 2013: A judge at Leeds County Court ruled the 'first come first served' policy was unlawful discrimination in breach of the Equality Act 2010. First Group was given six months to change its policy . November 2014: Martin Chamberlain QC, for First Group, appealed against the ruling, claiming it was an example of a long-running problem on public transport that had produced conflicting court decisions and bus operators were now seeking legal clarity. December 2014: Lady Justice Arden, sitting with Lord Justice Lewison and Lord Justice Underhill, said there was no law which says bus companies must force selfish passengers to make space for a wheelchair. Drivers should instead 'persuade' passengers to do the right thing. The judge added: 'It is obvious that, as one wheelchair user has said, for them the world was not built with a ramp.' However the only question the court had to answer was whether it would be reasonable for the First Group bus company to have to adopt the policy in favour of wheelchair users proposed by Mr Paulley. The judge said the answer to that question 'in the current circumstances is no'. Mr Paulley, from Wetherby in Yorkshire, attempted to board the bus to visit his parents in Leeds on February 24th, 2012. But he was told to wait for another when the woman with the pushchair refused to move because her baby was asleep. A judge at Leeds County Court ruled that First's policy of 'requesting but not requiring' non-disabled travellers, to move out of the space if it is needed by a wheelchair user was in breach of the Equality Act 2010. He awarded Mr Paulley £5,500 damages. Lord Lewison said that Mr Paulley has asked to appeal to the Supreme Court, but the judges refused permission to appeal. He added that he felt it was up to the Supreme Court to decide if they felt it was 'appropiate' to take the case. Mr Paulley's case was funded in court by the Equality and Human Rights Commission, . Mr Paulley described how on February 24 2012 he tried to board a number 99 bus at Wetherby to Leeds to take a train to visit his parents at Oldham. He said: 'Somebody got there just before me and put a pushchair in the wheelchair space. The bus driver asked her to leave, but she refused so I was not allowed on the bus. 'I ended up missing my train and arriving at my parents an hour late.' Mr Paulley added: 'We are saying it is a reasonable adjustment for a bus company, as a service provider, to insist wheelchair space be made available if needed.' Mr Paulley said that he might appear to be 'a confident guy' coming to court to fight for the rights of the disabled. But the problems posed by getting access to public transport 'impact on my confidence quite a lot'. He said: 'It is a question of not only not knowing whether you are going to be able to get on to a bus but whether there is going to be some conflict. 'Inter-personal conflict is not very pleasant. It is one of the many stresses of getting around in a wheelchair.' Campaigners for young disabled people said the ruling 'can only worsen the situation, particularly for those in rural areas who may heavily rely on bus services.' Victoria Wright, speaking for the Muscular Dystrophy Campaign Trailblazers, a network of young disabled people, said: 'We are frustrated and extremely disappointed by this decision, which means that wheelchair users do not have priority, in law, over wheelchair spaces on those buses that they are actually able to board. 'Travelling by public transport with a young child and buggy can be difficult and stressful - as a mother myself I am all too aware of this. However, the reality is that even today, many disabled people already find themselves unable to rely on public transport to commute to work, get to school or college or to travel to vital appointments like hospital visits. 'The UK's transport network, buses, trains and taxis alike, is still widely inaccessible and unpredictable, often leaving disabled people facing long delays and hugely increased journey times. This ruling can only worsen the situation, particularly for those in rural areas who may heavily rely on bus services. 'We will be closely monitoring how young disabled people are affected by the court's decision and the next steps needed to ensure the rights of wheelchair users are protected.'","Operator First Group had been ordered to pay damages to wheelchair user .

"We all have tricks to help us out of a ticket, but most of us would simply bat our eyelashes or make up a far-fetched excuse. But one man showed that knowing how to solve a Rubik's Cube might just come in handy one day. Steven Brundage was pulled over by police after he was caught driving over the limit as he left a party in New York City in the early hours of Saturday morning. But he managed to dodge a ticket after dazzling the cops with magic. Magician Steven Brundage was pulled over by cops when he was caught over the speed limit in New York . He says he was doing 42 miles per hour in a 30 zone. A ticket seemed certain, but in the clip he posted on YouTube the following day, he shows how he escaped. After the cop spotted the cards in his car, Mr Brundage revealed he was a magician. The officer asked him to perform a trick and if he was suitably impressed, he would be free to go. After the magician says he would complete a Rubik's Cube in a set time, the cop jokingly says: 'I can't say like one second, that's not going to happen.' They agree he has 15 seconds to complete the cube but Mr Brundage takes an extra five seconds to complete the task as the officers count out loud. But the magician escaped with no ticket after dazzling officers with his Rubik's Cube trick on Saturday . In his first trick, he completes the Rubik's Cube in just 20 seconds and an officer shakes his hand . The officer's are suitably impressed - but then Mr Brundage says he can complete the cube in just one second as the officer originally suggested. Amazingly, he mixes up all the sides and throws the cube into the air, It then lands with every side complete. After mixing the sides up again, he throws it behind his back and again, catches it with every side complete. Accompanying his clip, Mr Brundage, from Schenectady in New York, wrote: 'December 5th around 3am I was pulled over doing 42 in a 30 MPH. 'I told the cop I was coming from a holiday party in NYC. 'He asked why I had all the cards in my car and I told him I was a magician. He then asked me to show him a magic trick. 'I'm glad to say I left without a ticket.' But Mr Brundage then follows it up with an even more impressive feat where he throws the cube in the air and it lands in his hands a second later with every side complete .","Steven Brundage was pulled over after he was caught driving over the limit .

"Fine at Lidl car park: Beryl Bourne-Mullen (left), 85, went shopping with her daughter Nina (right), 54 . A disabled pensioner was given a £90 parking fine for taking too long to shop at Lidl. Beryl Bourne-Mullen, 85, who suffers from osteoarthritis, went shopping for Christmas presents and food with her daughter Nina, 54, at the supermarket’s store in Sevenoaks, Kent. The mother-of-two - who admits she is ‘slow’ and takes more time than an average person to get up and down the aisles - was shocked after a letter came in the post a week after their trip. The pair, who admit not noticing the signs in the car park which notified customers of a 90-minute free parking restriction, had already spent £95.88 in the store when they broke the time limit by 15 minutes. Mrs Bourne-Mullen said: ‘I am very upset, I am very angry and I do not think it is fair what happened to us. I walk with a stick and I take a very long time to get around places. ‘I rely on my daughter to take me around and now she has been given a ticket because of me. I feel awful and I feel like a burden to her. It is a horrible thing to feel all because of a parking ticket. ‘It takes me a lot longer to get round the shops than a normal person and I was doing a big shop because I wanted to stock up for Christmas. My daughter was also very angry. ‘There was no ticket on the car but we got a letter in the post around a week later. We were only 15 minutes over the time, and it is so unfair that we have been fined. ‘It is a shame because I will not be going back to the shop again and they have lost my money now. It has been a very stressful time for me and my family - this is a lot of money. Supermarket: Lidl said that customers who have overstayed in one of its car parks should 'provide us with proof of purchase and we will appeal the charge on their behalf' (file picture of a Lidl store) ‘We have basically paid double for the shopping just because I am slow. I am so very upset and angry.’ Her daughter, a printer, who lives with her mother in Sevenoaks, said: ‘I have never had a fine before and we had no idea there was a limit. It’s a supermarket. ‘My main concern at the time was getting my mother in and out of the shop. If I’d known, I wouldn’t have taken her there because she is handicapped and it takes time with an older person to go round a shop. ‘She’d not been there before and wanted to have a good nosey round and we ended up spending a lot of money. ‘I appreciate that the store is near the station and they don’t want people taking spaces for too long but other supermarkets give customers two-and-a-half to three hours. ‘It would be pretty obvious to anyone who saw us on camera that my mother walks with a stick and is slow. But I’ve been to Lidl and they’ve said it’s all done by a private company and it’s nothing to do with them. ‘During this season people are doing bigger and longer shops than they normally do so I want to make people aware of the situation because the signs are not obvious.’ Previous incident: Blind Anne Lazell (left), 73, told the Mail in August how her carer Heather Dawson (right) got a £90 fine because they had exceeded the 60 minutes allowed in a Lidl car park in Hadleigh, Essex . A Lidl spokesman said: ‘While the vast majority of our store car parks do not have any car park management systems in place, we do have procedures in place in a small number of our store car parks, to help manage the availability of car parking spaces and ensure that our customers take priority. ‘Some of these car parks are managed by ourselves or accredited contractors and some are managed by our landlords. In retail parks where we do not own the car parks, we are, consequently, not in charge of the management of those car parks. ‘We do however encourage any genuine Lidl customers who have received a parking charge notice to get in touch with us directly via our customer services hotline number. ‘Customers who have overstayed in one of our car parks should then just provide us with proof of purchase and we will appeal the charge on their behalf. ‘Customers who have special requirements and may have difficulty with the parking restrictions in place should also get in touch with our customer services team who will find a solution to their car parking needs.’ It is not the first incident of its kind - after a blind pensioner who needs a carer to help her around supermarkets received a parking fine at another Lidl store because she took too long to shop. Anne Lazell, 73, who had been shopping in Hadleigh, Essex, told the Daily Mail in August that after her two-hour visit her carer got a £90 fine  because they had exceeded the 60 minutes allowed.","Beryl Bourne-Mullen went shopping for presents and food in Sevenoaks .

Here is the key used to open the doors to get into the homes… . 'I have a bow; I've got a clover and a star. Here is a Santa with a pine tree that he is going to decorate. There's an elf here who helps Santa in his factory. And here I have written, ""Santa Claus - Merry Christmas"". And here next to that, the Star of David,' Martins said. Even though the artist says he is completely dedicated to fulfilling the part of Santa, he says not everyone is so thrilled when they discover he is almost completely covered in tattoos.

'Some people seek me out to find out who this ""tattooed Santa"" is. While others find out (I have tattoos) and all of a sudden they don't want to work with me anymore and look for a different Santa. It depends a lot on the individual,' Martins said. All the same, this father of two says he understands why some people might hesitate to let their child sit on a tattoo-covered Santa. But he also says he thinks the prejudice he sometimes faces will someday be a thing of the past as younger generations grow up more accustomed to people sporting skin art. 'So you and your wife have tattoos, but your kids don't yet. But when they're ten or 12-years-old, they're gonna want to get one, and you won't be able to say ""no"", because you have some. So this generation is going to change.

"With the average house price in the UK rocketing to £260,000, getting on the property ladder is out of reach for many. But those looking to buy a place of their own might want to try what is being called the cheapest street in Britain, where houses have been known to go on the market with a guide price of just £750. Limetrees Close, in the Port Clarence area on the outskirts of Middlesbrough, is the site of two of the cheapest homes sold in the country last year and now has a two-bedroom semi-detached property up for auction with a guide price of just £5,000. Since January 2013, eight properties have sold in Limetrees Close, in the Port Clarence area of Teesside which has been dubbed the cheapest street in Britain, fetching from £8,500 to £33,000. Four properties are currently on the market, with one advertising a guide price of just £5,000 . Limetrees Close saw two of the cheapest homes sold in the country last year and now has a two-bedroom semi-detached property up for auction with a starting price of just £5,000 (above, left). It has two bedrooms, a bathroom, kitchen, living room as well front and back gardens . The street has an average house price of just £16,714 and has seen properties auctioned off with a guide price of just £750 (left, green door) Limetrees Close is situated in the deprived community of Port Clarence, which has poor transport links to nearby Middlesbrough and Stockton . Two of the cheapest properties to sell in the street last year fetched £8,500 and £9,000, confirming the road as one of the least expensive in the North East, according to the Land Registry. Other properties in the road have sold for £10,500, £14,000 and £23,000 over the last two years. The most expensive to sell in the close since last January fetched just £33,000. The three-bedroom property which sold for £14,000 could have been snapped up for as little as 10p, because no reserve was placed on the property. It was auctioned off with a guide price of just £750 but reached its eventual price after a small bidding war. The average house price in the UK for 2013 was £166,262, but for homes on Limetrees Close that figure was just £16,714. A Land Registry spokesman said: 'Officially we can't be sure, but the figures speak for themselves. It is an extremely cheap street.' The latest vacant property to go on the market consists of a ground floor lounge, kitchen, two first-floor bedrooms, a bathroom and outside gardens and has a guide price of a mere £5,000. The bargain buy is £220,000 less than a similar two-bedroom family home in South East London auctioned by Eddisons, which is due to be offered this week. The reserve on the London property is £225,000 and although it boasts a garage, all the rooms on display are relatively the same size as the house on Limetrees Close. Last year, a number of properties, some of which were three-bedroom,went on the market and sold for prices ranging from £8,500 to £23,000 . The latest vacant property to go on the market has a guide price of a mere £5,000 - £220,000 less than a similar property for sale in London . The latest property to go up for sale (pictured) has two bedrooms, a bathroom, living room, gardens and a kitchen, but is on sale for just £5,000 . The average house price in Limetrees Close for 2013 stood at just £16,714 .

Limetrees Close is situated in the deprived community of Port Clarence, close to the River Tees and the Tees Transporter Bridge. The area suffers from a very high crime rate, and high unemployment rate, and has seen its fair share of arson, fly-tipping and anti-social behaviour. It is also isolated from nearby towns with poor transport links to nearby Middlesbrough and Stockton. The £750 house, dubbed the UK's cheapest house, was eventually sold last year for £14,00 - less than the price of some new Ford Focus models - through I-Am-Sold property auctions. At the same auction, a similar property on the same road sold for just £10,500 meaning two houses were bought on the same day for a combined price of less than £25,000. Despite being located in Port Clarence, an area notorious for vandalism and crime, the properties were marketed as ‘an ideal investment'. Kirsty Wallace, auction coordinator for I-Am-Sold, said: 'We have a history of properties in Limetrees Close selling for extraordinary low prices at auction, so you could call it a bargain street. 'It's definitely worth someone investing in because its a relatively new estate and some of the properties are now selling at £30,000 on Right Move.

'Some of the homes may need a bit of work, but the price will reflect that and with such low prices, it would be difficult to resist for some developers.'

Limetrees Close is in the deprived Port Clarence area, near Middlesbrough . Limetrees Close is situated in the deprived community of Port Clarence, on the edge of Middlesbrough. Port Clarence suffers from a very high crime rate, and very high unemployment rate, and has seen its fair share of arson, fly-tipping and anti-social behaviour. It is also isolated from nearby towns with poor transport links to nearby Middlesbrough and Stockton. A severe fire at a wood recycling plant in Port Clarence in March 2011 lasted for nine days, with arson suspected as the cause of the blaze. Five people were arrested afterwards but all were released without charge. Government figures, released last year, reveal the life expectancy of men born in Middlesbrough is currently 75.8 years. The average life expectancy for women is 80.1 years. Stockton North MP Alex Cunningham has previously said that 'more needs to be done' in the area. He said: 'I’ve been contacted by people living in Limetrees Close. 'That particular street has been subject to fly-tipping and arson, but another issue is to do with dilapidated homes.' Absentee landlords have been blamed for the decline of the area, with some properties being sold on instead of repaired and maintained properly.","Limetrees Close in Teesside, dubbed 'cheapest street in Britain' with homes auctioned with guide price of just £750 .

"The decision by a judge  to throw out all five charges against Shrien Dewani will raise serious questions about the South African authorities' long and expensive pursuit of the bisexual businessman. Pre-trial briefings suggested prosecutors considered their case against Dewani to be 'water tight', 'a fact' and 'powerful'. Within days of the trial opening, however, a number of South Africa's leading legal practitioners and academics lined up to express shock at the poor quality of some of the state's witnesses. In an interview with MailOnline, William Booth, head of South Africa's Law Society, predicted that Dewani's legal team would apply to have his case dismissed after only a fraction of the 16 prosecution witnesses had given their testimonies. In addition to poorly-prepared witnesses, the prosecution's threadbare case was hampered further by a string of successful applications by the defence to exclude significant planks of the state's case – leaving little or no compelling evidence to link Dewani to the honeymoon murder of his wife. Here, MailOnline looks at the main reasons why the case collapsed. Fallen pillar: Taxi driver Zola Tongo (above) was sentenced to 18 years for his part in arranging the honeymoon murder. Tongo was the only witness who claims to have had any direct contact from Dewani about his desire to have his wife murdered, but his story did not stand up well to days of cross-examination . A POOR 'STAR' WITNESS . Taxi driver Zola Tongo was the only witness who claimed to have had any direct contact from Dewani about his desire to have his wife murdered. The prosecution's main claim - that there was a plot to kidnap and kill Anni during a fake carjacking - could only be established 'beyond reasonable doubt' by Tongo. In his argument to have the case against his client dismissed, Francois van Zyl told the Western Cape High Court: 'Tongo is the pillar on which this case rests. If that pillar falls then the whole case collapses.' Tongo turned out to be weak on the witness stand  - his story did not stand up to days of cross-examination. He was described by the judge today as 'inconsistent', his evidence dismissed in a three-hour judgment today as 'making no sense', with 'poor' explanations to back them up. Another witness, convict Mziwamadoda Qwabe, also failed to impress when he struggled to tell the difference between his right and left. The fact that Tongo benefited from a reduced sentence in return for giving evidence against Dewani was, the defence team suggested, even more reason to treat his testimony with caution. However, even though some key elements of his story were borne out by Monde Mbolombo and Mziwamadoda Qwabe – they too had holes punched in their testimonies by Mr van Zyl and Pieter Botha, for the defence. The prosecution had lined up a number of witnesses to testify to Dewani's homosexuality, including Leopold Leisser (right), known as the German Master, but when Dewani openly admitted that he was bisexual at the start of the trial, it paved the way for his defence to call for the evidence to be deemed irrelevant . DEWANI'S SEXUALITY RULED OUT AS A MOTIVE . The prosecution were not obliged to offer a motive for Dewani wanting his wife to be killed but they identified his clandestine relationship with men, including a male German prostitute, visits to gay clubs and online chat rooms as a possible reason for him to want to be free of his new marriage. He had kept these visits secret from Anni. The prosecution had lined up a number of witnesses to testify to Dewani's homosexuality, including Leopold Leisser, known as the German Master, and a detective from Scotland Yard who retrieved a bundle of sexually-explicit e-mails between Dewani and an older man. However, on day one of his trial, Dewani informed the court – via a written explanation of his not guilty pleas – that he was a bisexual who had enjoyed relationships with both women and men. This was to be the prosecution trump card yet the revelation, less than 200 words in to a 37-page disclosure rendered the prosecution's intended probing into Dewani's sexuality 'irrelevant'. It meant Mr Leisser's appearance in court, when it came, was considerably shorter than the usual length of a booking to which he had become accustomed in his professional life. This also paved the way for Dewani's defence team to call for their client's sexuality to be deemed irrelevant to his murder trial - and it duly was. Inconclusive: Shrien Dewani wept as his trial was shown CCTV footage of him laughing and kissing his new wife (pictured) as they walked back to their hotel the night before her death . Anni's final hours: Shrien Dewani strides ahead, hands in pockets, towards the Surfside seafood restaurant, in Strand - an unfashionable seaside town in Cape Town - leaving his new bride trailing behind shortly before she was gunned down on their honeymoon in a carjacking allegedly staged by her husband . Prosecutor Adrian Mopp attempted to argue that since Dewani had consistently described himself as a gay man seeking other gay partners on 'hook-up' websites such as Gaydar and Recon, the court should hear more about his conflicted feelings towards his new bride. Judge Jeanette Traverso disagreed and ruled that the e-mails were inadmissible as was the vast majority of what Leopold Leisser was prepared to say. The fact that Dewani had told the Birmingham-based escort – who specialises in fetishism and role play - that he needed 'to find a way out' of his engagement to Anni and other conversations they'd shared, was not allowed to be shared with the court. CCTV footage (above) of the newlyweds, captured by cameras at the Cape Grace hotel, was presented by both defence and prosecution as an insight into their relationship, making it inconclusive. Film of the honeymooners – in the 24 hours before Anni's death – could be interpreted as showing them miserable and unhappy as well as playful and loving. Caught on CCTV: In one video clip shown to the courtroom, Dewani is captured leading alleged fixer Tongo down a hotel corridor to a quiet room, carrying a small bag . Evidence: The opening shot of the surveillance camera sequence shown to the South African court shows suspect Shrien Dewani walking through the foyer of the Cape Grace hotel days after his new wife's murder . Follow me: Dewani leads the way as he takes the cab driver to a part of the hotel not covered by CCTV . AN 'ALIBI' FOR 'SECRET' MEETINGS AND AN IMPROBABLE PLOT . Until the start of the trial, the prosecution were confident that CCTV film and phone records which showed how Dewani and Tongo met, messaged and spoke in the hours before and after Mrs Dewani's murder was proof of a conspiracy between them. Certainly, security footage of two private rendezvous between Tongo and Dewani in the wake of Anni's murder provided some of the most dramatic evidence of the trial. The first was recorded on the morning following the carjacking of Tongo's car as they waited for news of Mrs Dewani, who had last been seen being driven away by two gunmen. The second was a meeting in which Dewani was seen waiting for Tongo on the day he returned to the UK, in his hand a bag containing money which he admitted giving to the driver. However, Dewani's lengthy plea statement to the court provided an apparently plausible explanation for the frequent contact between the two men. According to Dewani, Tongo had agreed to organise a surprise helicopter trip for his new bride – a plan that necessitated private meetings and phone contact in the hours before the carjacking that claimed Mrs Dewani's life. A large bundle of cash that Dewani had put in his wife's bag was the deposit for the honeymoon treat. It was not, as detectives suspected, a payment for his wife's killers. Dewani's account of how he was freed from the taxi (above) before his wife was shot dead differed over time . SHODDY INVESTIGATION . Between the time Shrien Dewani reported his wife missing in Zola Tongo's car, with two gunmen at the wheel, until her body was discovered, the case was handled by a string of low-ranked police officers. Once her body had been found in the back of Tongo's abandoned VW Sharan, the case was handed over to the Hawks – South Africa's elite detective unit. Prior to the Hawks stepping in, the investigation was marked by lost notebooks, incomplete witness statements and an inadequate ballistics investigation which had to be re-visited even after the trial got under way. Judge Jeanette Traverso repeatedly reminded prosecutor Adrian Mopp that he had had four years to get his case in order, before scolding him for 'scurrying around' finalising evidence and identifying new witnesses weeks into the hearing. New ballistics tests, ordered by the defence, also appeared to cast doubt on whether Xolile Mngeni had been accurately identified as the assassin who fired the fatal shot. Mngeni died last month of a brain tumour. It was another defence initiative that exposed the true extent of Monde Mbolombo's role in Anni's fatal shooting. Previously identified only as a 'link man' between Tongo and the two assassins he hired to fake a carjacking and kill the honeymooning bride, Mbolombo played a far bigger role on the night of the murder. Once the two gunmen had missed the first rendezvous with Tongo's car on a corner of Gugulethu, Mbolombo stepped in to 'project manage' the second attempt, stepping in to coordinate the killers on the ground. It was only when Dewani paid for new sound tests to be carried out on CCTV footage of Mbolombo on the phone at the hotel reception where he worked, that the former porter's true role was revealed. Although he received immunity from prosecution for giving evidence against Mngeni and Dewani, Judge Traverso warned him that it may not be extended.","Prosecutors considered their case against the millionaire to be 'watertight'

"Demonstrators took to the streets of Berkeley, California for yet another march Monday night to protest the police-related deaths of Michael Brown and Eric Garner. The march brought traffic to a crawl on both directions  of Interstate 80 just before 9pm local time, as hundreds of protesters walked out onto the freeway. Police were eventually able to break up the group, but cops and protesters faced off again on a pedestrian bridge stretching across the major thoroughfare.

A doctor who tried to stop the looting was injured when one of the thieves hit him in the head with a hammer. The California Highway Patrol also deployed tear gas against protesters on Sunday after explosives were thrown at them. Tear gas was also used against the protesters on Saturday, which Berkeley Mayor Tom Bates admits may have been an overreaction. Police kept a noticeably wider distance  on Sunday, but that only led to more businesses getting vandalized. On Monday, many business owners closed early and boarded up in preparation for the march, and nearby UC Berkeley sent out an email to staff suggesting they leave campus by 4:30pm. 'It was really disturbing,' Bates said of the weekend protests, as reported by ABC 7. 'It turned violent and it turned violent in a way that we haven't seen here for a long, long time. Over the weekend, over 16 various stores were trashed, not just major businesses, but small businesses.' Berkeley has a  history of civil disobedience, as one of the focal point for protests against the Vietnam War in the 1960s and 1970s. Because of this history, local police are not allowed to have search dogs, stun guns or helicopters. 'The people in the Bay Area are sensitive to worldwide issues,' Bates said, according to NBC Bay Area. 'Unfortunately, there is a small element that uses violence at times to make their point.'

"Britain spends nearly four times more on providing health and welfare cover than Romania, according to European Union officials. They found that the UK spent £7,000 on welfare for every man, woman and child in the country in 2012 – more than a quarter of the national income. Health provision, family subsidies, old age benefits and pensions for workers in Romania are a fraction of those in Britain. Britain is the fifteenth biggest welfare spender in Europe - with a benefits bill £1,000 higher per person than the average . The huge differences in support were laid out in an EU paper, the details of which have been published by the Office for National Statistics. It comes at a time when both David Cameron and Ed Miliband have pledged to cut benefits for immigrants from Europe. The Prime Minister has said he will stop EU citizens from claiming benefits for four years, and the Labour leader has spoken about extending the waiting period before EU migrants can claim and preventing tax credits and child benefit being paid for children who live abroad. Figures show that since autumn 2013 more than 100,000 Romanians have applied for national insurance numbers to allow them to work in Britain. George Osborne, at Manchester City's new City Football Academy, wants to slash welfare spending . The latest paper, from the EU’s statistics arm Eurostat, compares countries’ social spending using a measure called the ‘purchasing power standard’ (PPS) to even out price differences. This means its results take into account the fact that the same sum of money can buy much more in some countries than others. According to the measure, Romania spent 2,080.1 on welfare for every member of its population in 2012. This covered benefits and pensions for older people, healthcare, family support, disability benefits, housing, unemployment support, and widows’ benefits. British spending on welfare was 7,356.8 on the PPS measure. Translated into sterling, that meant £6,959 per person. The £443.3billion total spend amounted to more than 28 per cent of GDP. The ONS analysis found 44.7 per cent of that went on older people, in pensions, winter fuel payments and TV licences. Much of the rest of the spending was available to EU migrants in some form, with 32.8 per cent going on healthcare, including NHS hospitals, GPs and free or subsidised medicines on prescription. The Chancellor, centre right, shakes hands with Manchester City's captain Vincent Kompany at the official opening of the club's new training ground . Together old age pensions, sickness benefits and healthcare spending accounted for more than three quarters of welfare spending in Britain. Britain spent 5.5 per cent of its welfare budget on housing – more than five times the EU average. Although there are few official figures, occupation of council and social housing by newly arrived immigrants has been a source of tension, particularly in East London, since the mid-2000s. British social spending was also more than twice as high as social spending in Poland, counted as 3,278.2 in PPS terms. Romania had the lowest social spend of any EU country, while Britain’s was 17.5 per cent above average, the report said. A study by the MigrationWatch think-tank last year said Romanian families can improve their living standards eight or nine times by coming to Britain. A family with one worker, a dependent spouse and two children can claim housing benefit, council tax benefit, child benefit, and tax credits. Across Europe Britain is the fifteenth largest spender on social protection – behind France, Germany and Italy. But more than Spain, Greece and Portugal. Luxembourg spent more on welfare per head than any other country – lavishing twice as much as the European average. Chancellor George Osborne has vowed to cut billions off the welfare budget if the Tories win the next election. He wants to cut £3billion off tax credits, paid as a top-up to five million families on poor wages, in an attempt to rein back welfare spending. Mr Osborne said he would freeze all working-age benefits, including child benefit for two years. Tax credits cost £29.7billion last year - more than six times the £4.6bill for jobseeker’s allowance, and nearly double the cost of housing benefit. In the autumn statement, Mr Osborne said: 'Total welfare spending is now set to be £1bn a year lower than forecast at the budget and will go on falling as a share of our GDP. And as I’ve made clear I believe we need to freeze working-age benefits for two years – saving billions more.' A freeze on working-age benefits would knock as much as £350 a year off the income of a low-income family with one child.","Total welfare bill hits £443billion a year – or £6,959 for everyone in the UK .
This is 17.5 per cent more than the European average - some £1,037 .
Pensions, sickness pay and healthcare make up 75% of the welfare bill .

"Andrew Leigh, 42, is accused of murdering his estranged wife of eight years Luan, 42, (pictured) at their home in the Pype Hayes area of Birmingham . A jealous husband drugged his wife before strangling her to death at their home after finding out she was having an affair with another man, a court heard. Andrew Leigh, 42, is accused of murdering his estranged wife of eight years Luan, 42, after she rejected his attempts to get back together. Birmingham Crown Court heard today how Miss Leigh's body was discovered at the property in the Pype Hayes area of Birmingham at about 7.25am on June 29. The court heard how Leigh, a telecommunications engineer, had moved out of the property about a year ago but wanted to rekindle his relationship with his wife. However, she had 'moved on' and, in a jealous revenge attack, he allegedly drugged her with sleeping pills before strangling her to death in her own bed, jurors were told on the opening day of the trial. Opening the case, Rachel Brand QC, prosecuting, said: 'It was about 6.45am on June 29 when the defendant rang his wife's sister, a woman called Natasha Chamberlain. 'His opening remark was ""I am really sorry, Natasha, but your sister has passed away."" 'Natasha replied: ""What the hell do you mean? What has happened?"" 'He told her he found her dead in bed at about 10.30pm the previous evening but did not call an ambulance because he did know what to do at the time. 'He had killed his wife. 'When the ambulance arrived on the Sunday morning, Luan Leigh was as cold as ice.' Jurors were told that Leigh had drugged his wife on the Saturday evening with over-the-counter sleeping pills. Traces of the main ingredients were found in Mrs Leigh's blood during a post-mortem examination. Ms Brand said: 'We do not how much was given to Luan...but we do know she was drugged. 'Police found the empty packet of tablets, along with their receipt and instructions of use in the house. 'He was on CCTV buying [tablets] in the Lloyds pharmacy in Walmley on the Saturday morning.' The court heard how Leigh had become aware his estranged partner was dating somebody else after going through her phone and trying to hack her Facebook account. Miss Leigh's body was discovered at the couple's marital home in the Pype Hayes area of Birmingham (pictured)  on June 29. A post-mortem found she had high quantities of sleeping pills in her system . Ms Brand added: 'Luan told her sister and friends that he once locked her in her garage in a bid to get back together. 'He had also tried to hack into her Facebook account. 'About one week before her death, Luan told Andrew that she did not want him to go on a family holiday and gave him his money back. She wanted to take her mother instead. 'It transpired that the defendant had been snooping around her mobile phone on the evening of June 25. 'She had just starting seeing someone else and the defendant found out about it. He did not move on.' Leigh denies one count of murder. The trial, which is expected to last two weeks, continues.

"A grandmother was brutally attacked in her own home by a violent prisoner on day release, meaning she could not be with her dying husband of 55 years. Theresa Cain, 78, was left lying in a pool of her own blood following the vicious assault by inmate Paul Steadman, who had a history of violence against vulnerable people. The pensioner spent more than a month in hospital following the horrific ordeal which meant she could not be by the bedside of her husband, John, in the last weeks before he died. Theresa Cain, 78, was brutally attacked by a violent prisoner on day release from Kirkham Prison, which meant she could not be with her dying husband, John, with whom she had been married 55 years . Steadman, 45, had been serving an indeterminate sentence in relation to another burglary at a pensioner's home when he was let out of Kirkham Prison, in Lancashire on day release and failed to return. Mrs Cain's son, Peter, 42, said: 'It's so tragic. 'The last two weeks of my father's life, my mother couldn't be with him because she was in her own hospital bed.' Mrs Cain spent more than a month in hospital following the vicious assault by the prisoner . In a victim statement, he said: 'Due to mum's head injury she did not understand what was happening to dad and it was heartbreaking having to explain to her time and time again that dad had passed away - this was emotionally draining both for mum and me. 'The injury to her head had robbed her of the precious time both she and my dad had left together after 55 years of marriage. 'As a family, we tried to arrange our fathers funeral trying to involve mum in decisions but ultimately she could not remember making any of the arrangements. 'This is not how 55 years of marriage should end.' When the attack happened on May 4 this year, Mrs Cain, from Preston, had been to visit her husband in hospital. Her son had been trying to contact her, but sensed something was wrong after a couple of hours and asked his sister to check on her. He said: 'My sister rang me to say she had found my mum was face down in a pool of blood and an ambulance was on the way. 'I got in the car and drove as fast as I could to the house. 'There was an ambulance, police cars, police with dogs and I was told I couldn't see my mum because it was a crime scene. I just felt sick with worry.' He added: 'It left me very angry and bitter that we've been let down. Beforehand my mum was an independent, mobile lady. 'She looked after all my dad's medication, she was a frequent person in the bank, she would get the bus to town, visit her friends, go for a coffee. 'She rarely does that now. She's got memory loss issues, she doesn't remember visitors she's had, she doesn't remember taking her medication. It's like she's got dementia over night.' Mrs Cain's son, Peter (pictured), 42, said the attack had robbed his mother of her confidence and said 'this is not how 55 years of marriage should end' He said that since the attack, her confidence had been affected and she had been moved  in to sheltered accommodation. Steadman is due to be sentenced for the attack on Thursday at Preston Crown Court. He will also be sentenced for other offences committed between May 3 and May 5, while absconding from prison. He has admitted burglary, aggravated burglary, grievous bodily harm, assault by beating, two counts of robbery and two counts of possession of an offensive weapon in a public place. On the upcoming sentencing, Mr Cain, from Bamber Bridge in Lancashire, said: 'I want him to go away for life. 'He should never be walking the streets again. He's got a history of violent crime which hasn't improved and he's a danger to society. 'My biggest thing that I want answered is why he was let out on day release. 'I dread to think it would happen to somebody else out there. 'He was supposed to be serving an indeterminate sentence. He shouldn't have been walking the streets.' Steadman, 45, had been serving an indeterminate sentence in relation to another burglary at a pensioner's home when he was let out of Kirkham Prison, in Lancashire on day release and failed to return . Prisons Minister Andrew Selous said: 'Open prisons and temporary licence are important tools in rehabilitating long-term offenders, but not at the expense of public safety. 'Absconds have reached record lows under this government, falling by more than 80 per cent in the last 10 years, but we have not been complacent. 'We have made major changes to tighten the system and these have contributed to a 40 percent fall in temporary release failures in the past 12 months. 'In future when prisoners are let out on temporary licence they will be tagged, more strictly risk assessed and tested in the community under strict conditions before being released.' A Ministry of Justice spokesman said prisoners could only be transferred to open conditions once they had passed a thorough risk assessment and been deemed suitable. The spokesman added that any prisoner who absconded, failed to return from a period of temporary release or committed a crime during their sentence, will not be able to return to an open prison or be granted temporary release again.","Theresa Cain, 78, was brutally attacked by prisoner Paul Steadman, 45 .

"Normally, they are to be found pulling Santa’s sleigh over roof-tops to the delight of countless children. But this festive season, reindeer can be found in a much more mundane location — stacked in packs in the deli aisle of a budget High Street supermarket. For Lidl, whose dramatic price-discounting has lured shoppers away from its rivals, is selling smoked reindeer meat this year among its Christmas delicacies. The packs are part of the German-owned chain’s ‘Deluxe’ range. But are we British — brought up on stories of Rudolph The Red-Nosed Reindeer — too sentimental to want a slice of Dasher, Dancer or Prancer with our Christmas lunch? And in any case, what does it taste like? Normally reindeer are associated with pulling Santa’s sleigh  the delight of countless children. But this festive season, reindeer can be found  stacked in packs in the deli aisle of a budget High Street supermarket . According to Lidl bosses, ‘reindeer resembles antelope in flavour and texture.’ But since most Britons will never have tasted antelope, this isn’t the most useful recommendation. So I decided to test it for myself and found some of this ‘tender and flavoursome’ Scandinavian delicacy sitting in the chiller cabinet in Lidl’s store in Wood Green, North London, alongside other cured meats. It comes from a company in Finland, with the meat originally from Russia. The animals are not kept in farms but are herded in the wild. Not surprisingly, the company that produces the meat has been accused by animal welfare groups of delivering ‘sick novelty for profit’ and making a mockery of the festive season. Zoe Brennan decided to test it and found some of this ‘tender and flavoursome’ Scandinavian delicacy in Lidl . Justin Kerswell, of the animal welfare and vegetarian group Viva!, is also concerned that wild predators of reindeer, such as wolves and bears, are shot to protect supplies for retailers. He says: ‘What Lidl aren’t telling their customers is that to put reindeer meat on British shelves, other large wild animals are systematically hunted or trapped and shot.’ Lidl denies this claim. A spokesman says the animals are slaughtered under EU guidelines and meet the firm’s ‘high standards of food safety, hygiene and animal welfare’. She adds: ‘The smoked reindeer that we sell is from the Yamalo-Nenets autonomous region in Siberia. The reindeers pasture freely in the tundra year around, changing location on almost a weekly basis.’ In that area of Siberia, reindeer are vital to the livelihoods of tens of thousands of indigenous herders in Russia’s ‘High Latitudes’, where temperatures can drop to minus 50c. The animals are used for meat, for skins to make clothes and tents, and to tow sledges. According to the Russians, reindeer meat is ‘ecologically clean’. Certainly, it is exceptionally lean — comparing favourably with fish for its high levels of health-boosting chemicals, such as omega-3 fatty acids, which protect against breast cancer and heart disease. Im a paper published last year, Ammar Eltayeb Ali Hassan, of the Arctic University of Norway said: ‘Reindeer meat is very healthy. ‘It contains more than double the values of some nutrients as other meats, and is comparable to chicken in fat. Reindeer meat also has more than twice as much vitamin B12 [which helps prevent anaemia] as veal or lamb.’ One of the reasons for its nutritious value is the animal’s diet, which, in the winter, is comprised mainly of lichens (which are rich in selenium, zinc and iron). But reindeer meat is hardly known in the UK — and when Gordon Ramsay offered a recipe for reindeer stew on his TV series, Gordon Ramsay’s F Word, there was a strong reaction from viewers. Reindeer meat is hardly known in the UK — and when Gordon Ramsay offered a recipe for reindeer stew on his TV series, Gordon Ramsay’s F Word, there was a strong reaction from viewers . So what will consumers make of Lidl’s carpaccio-style 100g packs of Deluxe Smoked Cured Reindeer Steak? The slices of meat are dark maroon in colour and smell overpoweringly smoky. My husband pronounced them ‘delicious’, but couldn’t resist asking: ‘Is this Donner, Blitzen, Prancer or Vixen?’ He said the steaks smelled ‘lovely, quite delicate . . . Like Italian salami, very smoky. A taste sensation, very salty. It’s less gamey tasting than venison. I definitely like it.’ Masterchef judge William Sitwell is not a fan of reindeer meat . However, food writer Rose Prince, who has a more professional palate, disagrees. She agrees that reindeer meat, which is essentially venison, is a lean and healthy option, but says these cured slices have ‘a horrible strong flavour — salty and artificially smoky’. She also points out that they are made from ‘reformed meat’, meaning they have been chopped to a mush then shaped into a salami. When she tried them, she says: ‘They were sweaty when they came out of the pack, then began to dry out quickly.’ She concludes: ‘It is a very nasty product and a waste of good meat. I don’t think reindeer meat slices will find much of a market in Britain, not just because of the emotional reaction to them, but also because they taste disgusting.’ William Sitwell, MasterChef judge and editor of Waitrose Kitchen magazine, is not a fan either. ‘I like eating venison. I think it’s important to eat free-range game — a mostly happy life, a lean meat — so good for the tummy and soul,’ he says. But he says the cured cuts ‘look awful’. ‘Why turn a wild product into something that looks cheaper than processed ham — the little roundels just cheapen its identity. ‘It’s shiny and gelatinous, which is not pleasant on the eye.’ HE ADDS: ‘Then there is the flavour. Any merit the meat might have had is overwhelmed by too much smoke and too much salt. ‘The only way to eat this would be buried in a bun with lashings of pickle and salad. It’s a shame, an opportunity missed to encourage people to eat more natural food.’ Reindeer are strong runners and are the most . energy efficient of all land animals . For its part, Lidl says its reindeer meat is selling well — particularly in the South-East. Perhaps the last word should go to one of the chain’s checkout girls. As she packs my shopping, she says: ‘I’ve eaten venison. It’s very tasty.’ I ask her if she has tried the reindeer. She wrinkles her nose. ‘Not the reindeer,’ she says. ‘I think eating Rudolph would be a step too far for me.’","Normally reindeer are associated with pulling Santa’s sleigh .

"A couple are searching for answers after a police officer shot dead their beloved dog Hank after he escaped their yard - but will not face a review. Matthew and Allison Belanger, from Tulsa, Oklahoma, said they were shocked when the officer knocked on their door on Thursday to say he had shot a dog and wanted to see if it was theirs. They assumed it wouldn't be their 35-pound mixed breed dog Hank, a loving pet who they thought was safely contained in the yard. So they were stunned to see his body on the ground. 'When I saw Hank, I lost it,' Mr Belanger, 24, wrote in an account of the incident on Facebook. Missed: Hank the dog, pictured with one of the family cats, was shot dead by a police officer on Thursday evening after he reportedly became aggressive towards a woman while she was walking her dog . Despite never having escaped before, Hank had somehow got through a gate in their yard and had wandered into the street. The police told the Tulsa World that Hank had run over to a woman walking her dog and became aggressive so she sprayed him with pepper spray. He continued to be aggressive, she said. She called police and when the officer, Don Chandler, arrived, Hank again became aggressive, police said. Chandler shouted at the dog to stop and when he did not, he shot the animal twice. Officer Leland Ashley told the Tulsa World that the police report - which is not yet available - did not mention any injuries to the woman who had called police. He added that the officer will not face a review board for the shooting, as is protocol, but that he did have to explain in detail his decision to use deadly force. Questions: Hank pictured with his family's other dog, Harriet. His owners say they find it hard to believe that he became so aggressive  - and questioned why the officer didn't Tase or hit the dog before shooting him . Gentle: Hank was shot after he somehow got out of the couple's yard - which he had never done before . When Belanger went into the street and learned what had happened, he 'lost it', he said. 'I yelled at the police asking them why they had to shoot him,' he wrote. 'He is a 30 pound dog for goodness sake. What about a taser, a baton, or even a kick to the face?' Family: Matthew and Allison Belanger said they have no children so it was as if Hank was their son . He said that he was horrified when the police said that he should be fined for having the dog out. 'Again, I lost it,' he wrote in the Facebook post. 'I yelled at them that it was absurd that I had to pay a fine for them to unjustly (my opinion, obviously) kill my dog. 'I wish it were easy to believe that the police were honest and telling the truth but things just did not make sense. 'How they described his behavior was totally uncharacteristic of Hank.' He said that the dog, who was adopted by his brother-in-law a few years ago, took a liking to him and his wife and they ultimately took him in when his brother-in-law could not longer look after him. 'It is hard not to get attached to a dog that loves you so deeply,' Belanger wrote on Facebook. 'Allison and I do not have children yet so - in a way - Hank was like our little boy.' He recounted how Hank doted on their other pets, and when one of their cats had feline leukemia and could no longer look after herself, Hank would clean her instead. 'I know ""every dog owner thinks their dog is the sweetest dog in the world"" but Hank really was one of the sweetest in the world,' he said. Loving: Matthew explained how gentle the 35-pound dog was with their other animals, recalling how he would clean one of their cats when she developed leukemia and could no longer clean herself . Home: Mr Belanger said the police officer knocked on his door to say he had shot a dog outside but he never thought it would be Hank. He was stunned when he saw the dog's body in the road . 'He lived to be petted, eat wet dog food and doggie bacon, and sleep on our laps.' Speaking to the Tulsa World, Belanger said he was skeptical of the police's version of events and that his dog likely approached the woman because he wanted to be petted. He also said he has no idea how the gate opened, and suggested that children in the neighborhood might have opened it. 'I trust the police,' he said. 'I trust that they're here to protect us. It's just hard for me to believe that this was the only option available - to shoot a dog that had only loved people his entire life.'","Hank was in his owners' yard in Tulsa, Oklahoma on Thursday when he somehow got out into the street .

"Bosses of nuisance call companies could be hit with £500,000 fines in a Government crackdown on unwanted calls and texts. Up to one billion cold calls are received by British families each year leaving many elderly people 'too scared to answer the phone', ministers said. Culture Minister Ed Vaizey said nuisance calls were a 'plague' on families and had to stop. Ministers want to to impose tougher regulation on call centres amid growing public anger at the nuisance calls . The Government's Nuisance Calls Task Force said new rules should be introduced to make company bosses  responsible for cold-callers causing ‘severe distress’ to families. Under the plan, Payment Protection Insurance cold-callers could face fines of up to 20 per cent of their annual turnover. Which? executive director and taskforce chairman Richard Lloyd said many British firms were ‘breaking the law’. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the way in which the law was enforced had not been good enough. Mr Lloyd said the trade in personal data, responsible for the vast majority of nuisance calls, was ‘out of control’. He also called on regulators to clamp down on the abuse of existing legislation. ‘We want to see business with good reputations that aren't keeping a close enough eye on this making sure that there is someone senior on their board who will be held to account if those nuisance calls are being generated by that businesses activity,’ Mr Lloyd said. Between April and June this year, 40,000 people complained to the Information Commissioner about unwanted live or automated calls to their phones. Most focused on accident or PPI claims, as well as some debt consolidation company calls. The Nuisance Call Task Force said many consumers did not know that they had unwittingly given their consent to be contacted by these companies. Conservative MP Ed Vaizey, the Minister for Culture and the Digital Economy, said nuisance calls were a 'plague' Mr Vaizey said: ‘For too long, nuisance calls have plagued consumers, often at very inconvenient times of the day and in some cases, leaving vulnerable people like the elderly too scared to answer the phone. ‘That's why we're determined to tackle this scourge through the first-ever nuisance calls action plan. ‘We've already made progress, including making it easier for Ofcom to share information with the ICO about companies breaking the rules, and we're currently looking at lowering or removing the legal threshold before firms could be hit with fines of up to £500,000.’","Up to one billion unwanted phone calls are received by families each year .

"One of Ireland's last surviving D-Day veterans has been awarded France's highest military honour and dedicated his medal to fellow countrymen who fought in the Second World War. Pat Gillen, who was among the first wave of troops to invade Sword Beach on June 6 1944, was handed the Chevalier de la Legion d'Honneur in recognition of his role in the Normandy landings. The honour was bestowed upon the 89-year-old by French Ambassador Jean-Pierre Thebault at the Mercy Hospital in Cork, where he is being treated for ill health.

He received the Chevalier de la Legion d'Honneur (right) Mr Gillen said he felt 'thrilled and immediately unworthy' on receiving a letter from the French Embassy in recent weeks to notify him of the award. He said: 'In accepting this award, other brave Irish men, thousands of young men, who lost their lives in pursuit of peace remain in my memory. This award is as much theirs as mine.' During an emotional ceremony within the hospital, Mr Gillen told his family, Mr Thebault and hospital staff that when he landed 70 years ago it was the first time he had put feet on French soil. 'By the grace of God, I survived to be here today while many of my friends sleep in the fields of France,' he added. 'I feel both extremely honoured and humbled in receiving the Chevalier de la Legion d'Honneur conferred on me by President (Francois) Hollande and the government of France.' Mr Gillen, whose father and two uncles fought in France during the First World War, had planned to return to Normandy this year for the 70th anniversary. But he said he was 'grounded' by ill health. Instead, he penned a poignant message to his fallen comrades on a laurel handmade by his daughter Mary - decorated with poppies and an Irish tricolor ribbon. The tribute read: 'In memory of all commandos from the emerald island who lie in sleep in Normandy fields.' The rifleman, now a father of four and grandfather of 12, was in 6 Commando, a unit tasked with securing the strategically important Pegasus Bridge near Caen. More than half of his brigade were casualties in vicious assaults by German forces. He was never injured despite wearing his green beret in a six mile trek from Sword beach to Pegasus through marshland, sniper positions, a bogus minefield and several weeks in the trenches at Saulnier.

He made every moment more fun, and exciting. He pulled everyone out of their comfort zones and just let go,' Ms Widmer wrote. 'Ironically he told me and some others a week ago that when he died, he'd be p***** if his friends had a funeral and cried for him. He said he wanted to have a Viking Funeral and he wanted his friends to send him out to sea on a burning ship while celebrating and partying in the moonlight.

"Hayley Parsons, the founder of insurance comparison website GoCompare is to net £44m by selling her stake in the successful business . Eight years ago, Hayley Parsons sat at her kitchen table and sketched out a plan for a price comparison website. Today, the married mother-of-two is £44million richer after selling her shares in the company, GoCompare – best known for its adverts featuring ear-splitting opera singer Wynne Evans. The 41-year-old, from Cwmbran, South Wales, left school with six GCSEs and dreamed of becoming an interior designer. If she had succeeded, she says ‘today all the houses in the UK could be covered in animal print’. Instead, she took a job in a small insurance firm, where she made cups of tea and did basic admin. In her late twenties, she moved to Cardiff-based Admiral insurance where she worked in sales, and later helped launch the first UK motor insurance comparison site, Confused.com - the first car insurance comparison site in the UK. But after 14 years, Mrs Parsons – whose motto is ‘well-behaved women seldom make history’ – quit the firm and set up a rival site, a move she admits was ‘scary’. She and two former colleagues from Admiral worked from her kitchen table, later moving to premises where staff had to build their own Ikea desks. Her husband Mark gave up his job as a sales and marketing director to care for their two sons – aged four and 11 – when the company began to expand. Mrs Parsons was an unconventional boss, coming in dressed up as a devil on Halloween and setting up an office relaxation room, complete with a football table, a PlayStation and a Wii. Her company grew rapidly, and she was soon chief executive of a multi-million pound corporation. Last year GoCompare reported sales of £110million and pre-tax profits of £25million. Car insurance firm esure has owned half of GoCompare since 2010, when it exercised an option taken out in 2007 to buy a stake in the business. It bought the rest of the business in a £95million deal yesterday, including Mrs Parsons’ 23 per cent remaining stake. Ms Parsons wanted to employ a Welsh opera singer to star in television adverts for GoCompare . It had  valued the businesswoman's 23 per cent stake at around £44m. She sold it and stepped down as chief executive on the condition that the firm would keep the headquarters in South Wales. Mrs Parsons – who lives in an £840,000 five-bedroom home in Old St Mellons, near Cardiff – is now one of the richest businesswomen in Britain. 'I am very proud that a company I started at my kitchen table eight years ago has achieved so much in such a short period of time,' said Mrs Parsons. 'Today, we are a leading price comparison business in the UK and this is credit to all the wonderful, hard-working people we have in Newport.' She added that she has ‘done all right for a Welsh girl from the Valleys’. And she admitted that she had been lucky to have had the complete support of her husband, before joking: ‘I call him a house husband, and he calls himself a man of leisure, so we have debates over his job description.’ But despite her success, she says she does not live a champagne lifestyle and ‘can’t stand some of the people I meet in the business world, who think they’re important just because they’ve got money or they’ve got power or they’ve got a big title’. Ms Parsons set up the business in 2006 and it has become known for its adverts featuring an opera singer . She said: ‘I meet so many people in business who just get stuck up their own backsides and that’s not me at all.’ And when she was previously asked if she had ever faced challenges as a woman in business, she said: ‘I think that some women become transfixed with the “glass ceiling”. ‘I’ve always thought that if you believe there is a glass ceiling, you’ll spend your life on the floor looking up at it.’ As well as Ms Parsons, other selling shareholders in today's deal include GoCompare's employee benefit trust and current and former directors and staff. Jon Morrell, who is esure's deputy chief operating officer, will take over from Ms Parsons as GoCompare's chief executive. She added that esure's commitment to keep GoCompare's headquarters in Newport was an 'extremely important' part of her decision to sell the business. The deal, which is subject to Competition and Markets Authority approval, is expected to complete in the first quarter of next year. Find out more about Chwarae Teg here. Hayley Parsons was born in Cwmbran and grew up in the Valleys in Wales. She left Croesyceiliog comprehensive school in Wales at the age of 16 with five GCSEs. According to a recent Sunday Times Rich list the self-confessed 'Welsh girl from the Valleys' is now estimated to be worth around £95m. Ms Parsons lives in Rogerstone in Newport with her partner Mark and has two children, aged four and 11. She lives just a few miles from where she grew up in Cwmbran in a £840,000 five-bedroom home. The couple met in 2001 and as GoCompare took off, Mark quit his job as the sales and marketing director of a busy printing firm to stay at home with their eldest son. Speaking in 2010, she said: 'I call him a house husband, he calls himself a man of leisure, so we have debates over his job description.' In 1992 Ms Parsons got a job in sales at Cardiff-based insurer Admiral where she was to work for the next 14 years. During this time she quickly rose up the ranks. When she was 21 she helped set up an insurance broker called Gladiator and then was instrumental in the launch of the first car insurance comparison website, Confused.com by Admiral. In 2006 she left the company as she had always dreamed of running her own business and wanted to make a site that functioned better for customers. Ms Parsons then worked with a small team of two which grew to six to design GoCompare. She is known as a good networker and met a contact who offered £1.5m to invest in the fledgling business. Ms Parsons was awarded an OBE in 2012 .

"A Kansas airman accused of aggravated assault for exposing multiple sex partners to HIV at swinger parties in Wichita will have his appeal heard this week before the nation's highest military court. David Gutierrez was a sergeant at McConnell Air Force Base in Wichita in 2011 when he was stripped of his rank and sentenced to eight years in prison. But in an appeal that could upend similar prosecutions in the US military, the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces will take up his case on Tuesday. 'This case will have the potential of decriminalizing sexual contact with someone with HIV,' defense attorney Kevin McDermott said. Landmark appeal: Wichita airman David Gutierrez, who was jailed for eight years for failing to tell sexual partners he has HIV, will testify that medical advances in HIV treatment mean the laws are outdated . In addition aggravated assault, Gutierrez also was found guilty of violating an order to notify partners about his HIV status and to use condoms. He was also convicted of indecent acts and adultery. He has not been accused of actually infecting anyone with HIV. In his appeal, Gutierrez has challenged whether the risk to his sexual partners was high enough to constitute aggravated assault. He will argue that laws covering exposure to the disease are outdated since the statistical probability of heterosexual transmission is low and medical advances have made the disease treatable. 'About 100 years ago we used to have a lot of laws on the books that threw people in prison for having syphilis because you couldn't cure it. Once they came up with a cure a lot of those laws went along the wayside,' McDermott said. The risk of infection by an HIV-positive man during sexual intercourse with a woman varies widely, and each side in the case is citing the statistic within that range that is most favorable to their argument. Defense lawyers say the risk of infection ranged from a 1-in-10,000 to 1-in-100,000 chance per sexual encounter, which they contend is so low that it doesn't meet the legal standard for assault. Prosecutors, however, counter that the exposure risk was closer to 1 in 500. 'A 1-in-500 chance of receiving a deadly, incurable disease is not merely fanciful, speculative, or remote possibility. It is a real possibility,' they wrote. Gutierrez was a sergeant at McConnell Air Force Base in Wichita in 2011 when he was stripped of his rank . 'That real possibility of harm, when balanced with the magnitude of harm, certain death, provides more than enough justification to hold (Gutierrez) criminally liable here.' Government lawyers argued at trial that Gutierrez played Russian roulette with his sexual partners' lives and several people who had sex with Gutierrez and his wife testified that they would not have done so if they had known he was HIV-positive. The government is playing up that testimony on appeal. The case could have a broad sweep, since defense attorneys in a similar case winding through the Army appeals process have gotten involved with a rare friend-of-court filing. In that brief, defense lawyers said an 'epidemic of fear' pervaded the nation in the in the mid-1980s, when many of the applicable laws were written. They said that panic led to an expansion of criminal liability, and they urged the military appellate court to see HIV as a treatable condition. As of early this year, there had been more than 900 arrests or prosecutions in at least 38 states and the military of HIV-positive people accused of exposing others to the disease, according to the Global Network of People Living with HIV. Defense lawyers also say Gutierrez shouldn't have been convicted of adultery since he and his wife participated in group sex. They also contend that their client's due process rights have been violated by a long appeals process. Air Force prosecutors have declined comment.","David Gutierrez was jailed for 8 years and stripped of sergeant rank in 2011 .

"June Churchill (pictured) feared her husband David was going to 'cut her head off' during a brutal and sustained attack at their home after he cut her neck with a rusty knife - her scars are clearly visible . A bullying husband who attacked his wife with an axe, sliced her neck with a rusty knife and kept her prisoner for days before setting fire to their home has been jailed for 17 years. A court heard during the three-day ordeal June Churchill, who suffered a fractured skull, feared husband, David, 52, of Norfolk Road, Maghull, was going to 'cut her head off'. She later described the incident as being like 'a horror film'. Liverpool Crown Court heard that the couple had been together for 12 years and married for ten but by the time of the offences were living separate lives under the same roof. Mrs Churchill described her husband as manipulative and previously violent towards her but did not tell police as she still loved him. On September 29 this year they rowed about him wanting to move the television set into the garage. Ian Criddle, prosecuting, said: 'He grabbed her by the throat, put her in a headlock and threw her onto the couch, pulled her hair and punched her to the face causing her lip to bleed. 'He again threw her to the floor, threatening to kill her.' The court heard Churchill was arrested and bailed on condition he did not approach his wife or enter the house where they lived. But at midnight on  September 30, while Mrs Churchill was in bed asleep, he smashed his way into the home with an axe. Mr Criddle said: 'He told her, ""we can do this the hard way or we can do this the easy way.""' Churchill then tied her ankles and wrists together, gagged her, blind folded her and struck her in the chest with the axe, causing a four inch open wound. Hackney cab driver Churchill then frogmarched his  wife to the bathroom and made her sit on the toilet for 45 minutes, and hit her with the axe when she tried to escape. Mr Criddle told the court: 'He stood behind her while she was on the toilet. He was holding a rusty Stanley knife and was slashing her on her back and throat.' 'He pressed the knife to her neck trying to cut it and when that did not work he tried again and this time split it open. 'She thought at that point he was going to cut her head off.' When Mrs Churchill tried to escape she fell into the bath side and he hit her with the axe in the head. The Churchill's home pictured after husband David, a taxi driver, set fire to it to 'spite' his estranged wife . The court heard he also attempted to gouge her eyes out with his thumbs. Mr Criddle added: 'She feels lucky she wasn't blinded by that.' Churchill then took her to the bedroom and tied her to the bed where she was 'tethered' for three days while she repeatedly pleaded with him not to kill her. The court heard he 'dressed' her wounds using gaffer tape and a t-shirt and then spent his time playing poker on his computer and getting his finances in order. At 3.40am on October 3 Churchill agreed to take her to hospital. Mr Criddle said that Mrs Churchill, who is still visibly scarred, spent ten days in hospital and needed surgery under general anaesthetic. She suffered various lacerations, a fractured skull, spine, rib and eye socket. But before taking her to the hospital, Churchill poured paint thinners around the house and set it alight causing major damage. The blaze was spotted by passers-by who alerted the neighbours in the semi-detached house, John and Alison Cavanagh. The court heard they woke up their young children and led them to safety but are still traumatised by their ordeal. The fire spread to a neighbour's house, which is still in such bad condition they have been forced to move out . A victim impact statement by Mrs Cavanagh was read out in court and told how the couple had just finished refurbishing their home. The house was so damaged by fire, smoke and water damage they have had to move out to rented accommodation and it will take nine months to repair. Her statement said: 'He knew children were living next door but he set the house on fire. I thought I could trust him and I won't be so trusting in the future.' She added that firefighters told her if the passers-by had not alerted her family they would not have got out in time. The court heard that meanwhile there are problems with Churchill's insurers as the fire in his home had been started deliberately. Judge Brown told Churchill, who showed no emotion, 'It is very hard to imagine the horrendous ordeal she underwent and equally hard to appreciate the kind of consequences that your conduct has had in relation to her.' Nicholas Cockrell, defending, said that Churchill's health is deteriorating and he knows he may never leave prison. Churchill pleaded guilty to arson being reckless whether life was endangered, falsely imprisoning and wounding June Churchill with intent, assaulting her by beating and cultivating cannabis. The court heard that he was on bail for growing 148 cannabis plants, with a potential street value of £54,000, at the time of the offences. Jailing David Churchill for a total of 17 years today Judge Mark Brown said: 'I am satisfied in setting the fire you were acting out of spite and maliciousness towards your wife. 'You can properly be described as a controlling, spiteful and violent bully. You subjected her to a brutal and horrendous ordeal.'","David Churchill, 52, kept wife June prisoner for days during 'horror' attack .

"Obese people and those suffering heart disease, or diabetes should stay indoors during rush hour because of traffic fumes, doctors  warn. Pollution not only aggravates existing conditions but has been found to contribute to the cause of these diseases, they said. This is because air pollution exacerbates the development of high blood pressure and impaired insulin sensitivity, which are both risk factors for obesity and diabetes. They also recommended people with asthma, infants and the elderly should  avoid pollution hotspots. Doctors should start routinely advising people in these at-risk groups to avoid pollution, they said. People with obesity, diabetes, heart disease or asthma should stay at home during rush hour because traffic fumes can aggravate their conditions, doctors warn. This advice also applies to infants and the elderly . The experts from the European Society of Cardiology also called for a decrease in the use of fossil fuels. Professor Robert Storey, from Sheffield University, said: 'More than three million deaths worldwide are caused by air pollution each year. 'Air pollution ranks ninth among the modifiable disease risk factors, ahead of low physical activity, high sodium diet, high cholesterol and drug use.' There is now 'ample' evidence air pollution is associated with long term illness and death from cardiovascular diseases, he said. He added: 'It not only makes existing heart conditions worse but also contributes to development of the disease. 'Avoiding air pollution where possible may help to reduce cardiovascular risk and cardiologists should incorporate this information into lifestyle advice for their patients. He said: 'We also need to increase pressure on policy makers to reduce levels of air pollution. 'Air pollution should be considered one of the major modifiable risk factors to prevent and manage cardiovascular disease. 'Individuals, especially those with or at risk of cardiovascular disease, can take measures to reduce their exposure and doctors should include these in lifestyle advice. People with obesity, diabetes and heart disease should stay at home during rush hour to avoid traffic fumes, doctors have warned. This advice extends to asthmatics, infants and the elderly. People should avoid walking and cycling along busy roads, exercise in parks away from traffic and avoid busy times. The recommendations came from doctors from the European Society of Cardiology. To avoid pollution from outdoors seeping indoors, they recommended people could invest in  ventilation systems with filtration for their homes. They also called on policymakers to reduce levels of air pollution, and back this up with legislation. 'Policy makers urgently need to reduce levels of air pollution and this should be backed up by legislation.' A third of Europeans who live in urban areas are exposed to air pollution levels above European Union standards, the experts warned. But the World Health Organisation, who use more stringent criteria to calculate the number of people affected by pollution, say nearly nine out of 10 Europeans are being exposed to a level of pollution that damages health. Infants, the elderly and people with cardio-respiratory disorders should avoid walking and cycling along busy roads, exercise in parks away from traffic and avoid busy times. Those at risk should also ensure they always have their medication with them. But outdoor air pollution seeping into homes is still a problem, they warned. Most exposure typically occurs indoors, so experts recommend ventilation systems with filtration for homes in high pollution areas. Professor Storey added: 'Policy makers have an important role to reduce outdoor pollution in order to limit indoor pollution where much of the exposure occurs. 'Apart from reducing their personal contributions to outdoor pollution, there is not much that individuals can do about this unless they invest in systems to filter the air they breathe indoors. 'Moving away from the use of fossil fuels for energy production will result in major benefits to human health, both from reduced exposure to air pollution and from mitigation of climate change.' The paper was published in the European Heart Journal. World Health Organisation figures show nine out of 10 Europeans are exposed to levels of pollution which are damaging to health .","Air pollution makes conditions worse and contributes to their development .

"A Maine man accused of sending poison to a depressed Englishman who used it to kill himself is headed for a bail hearing. Sidney Kilmartin's hearing is scheduled for 1:30 p.m. Monday in Bangor. He is accused of sending potassium cyanide to Andrew Denton of Hull, England. Police say Denton was found dead in December 2012.

Kilmartin, of Windham, has pleaded not guilty to mailing injurious articles and mailing injurious articles resulting in death. He could face a maximum sentence of life in prison if he is convicted. Authorities haven't said how Kilmartin obtained the poison or how he and Denton initially found each other. Monday's hearing initially was scheduled to take place in November but it was postponed. The Portland Press Herald reports that an investigation released by English police says Sidney Kilmartin, of Windham, Maine, and Andrew Denton of Hull, England, exchanged emails in which Kilmartin offered to sell Denton potassium cyanide and gave him advice on how to use it. Police say Denton was found dead in December 2012. Over 18 months, officers were able to track the mail order down to Kilmartin's home in the town of Windham, near Portland. Potassium cyanide is a highly toxic, colorless salt often used in gold mining and electroplating. Exposure to it can result in rapid death. The court papers say Kilmartin, who lived in South Windham, posted the poison 'with the intent to kill or injure another.' Officers are said to be in the dark as to how Kilmartin came into possession of the deadly cyanide, as he is not thought to have worked in industries where the product was used. Kilmartin could have faced the death penalty if convicted, but U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder intervened and declined to seek it in this case, the Portland Press Herald reported. Kilmartin could have faced the death penalty if convicted, but U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder intervened and declined to seek it in this case . At the court hearing, Kilmartin's attorney, Jeffrey Silverstein, asked that a plea of not guilty by reason of insanity be recorded. At Mr Denton’s inquest in Hull, the coroner’s court was told that remnants of potassium cyanide had been found at his home. The toxicology report confirmed that he had died from cyanide poisoning.","Sidney Kilmartin is accused of sending potassium cyanide to Andrew Denton of Hull, England .

"New life: Beckie Lawton, 44, has had years of NHS weight-loss operations and now wants her breasts remodelled . A mother-of-two who  weighed  30 stone until she had £23,000 of NHS weight-loss surgery wants another taxpayer-funded procedure on her breasts so she can 'feel like a brand new woman'. Beckie Lawton, 44, had struggled with her weight since childhood but years of operations has helped her drop to 20 stone and fit in to a size 12 dress. Now she would like her breasts remodelled by the NHS, saying: 'I have worked since I was 15, paying tax and national insurance, so I have a right to have these operations.' Two years ago her diet of junk food left her wearing size 32 clothes and unable to climb stairs because it was too exhausting. After years of failed dieting and exercising, a desperate Miss Lawton turned to her GP for help and in 2012 was approved for a £9,000 NHS operation to fit a gastric band. Thanks to the surgery, and dieting and exercising, the mother-of-two lost a dramatic 18 stone, leaving her with unsightly and uncomfortable excess skin. Last month Miss Lawton, of Rugby, went under the knife again and had a tummy tuck on the NHS to the tune of £14,000. But now she wants the excess skin removed from around her breasts. She said: 'I feel much more confident now. I can wear clothes from nice shops and for the first time I can wear a dress without feeling embarrassed. Even my teenage daughter has started borrowing clothes off me. 'I have had an amazing transformation and my life is better in every respect. Once I have my next procedure then I will feel like a brand new woman.' Miss Lawton, a supermarket warehouse worker, is now recovering from her tummy tuck surgery which required nearly 200 stitches. She said: 'I know it is controversial to get weight loss surgery on the NHS, but people have to understand that patients who need a gastric band have usually struggled with their weight all their lives. 'Some people who struggle with their weight try to commit suicide, or turn to alcohol and drugs. If gastric surgery on the NHS helps these people, then no-one has the right to criticise. 'If I had stayed at the weight I was, I would have had a heart attack and died in a matter of years. I have two kids and they need their mother.' She is currently applying to the NHS for funding for an operation to raise and reshape her breasts which have sagged since her dramatic weight loss. Such an operation would cost around £4,000 at a private surgery. New life: Two years ago her diet of junk food left her wearing size 32 clothes and unable to climb stairs because it was too exhausting - now she is ten stone and fits in to a size 12 dress . Scarred: Miss Lawton, 44, has received £23,000 worth of weight loss surgery, first to fit a gastric band and then to removed excess skin . According to NHS guidelines, weight loss surgery may be offered to those whose morbid obesity could kill them, or to people who are morbidly obese and who have a serious condition such as type 2 diabetes or high blood pressure that could be improved if they lost weight. Until recently weight loss surgery has risen year on year in England, with rates highest in women and those aged 40-54 years old. But data shows there was a fall of 10 per cent in the number of weight loss procedures carried out between April 2012 and March 2013, suggesting patients are finding it harder to get referred or treated. The new study says doctors might not be correctly identifying or referring those eligible, and there may be too little capacity. Miss Lawton said: 'I have to wait to recover from my tummy tuck surgery so it will probably be around eight months before I can have any more surgery. 'I've lost the weight I wanted to, but now I need more procedures to deal with the way my body has changed. 'I have worked since I was 15, paying tax and national insurance, so I have a right to have these operations.' Miss Lawton, who has two children Sophie, 21, and Jessica, 16, always struggled with her weight but she her weight increase further as her marriage began to break down in 2007. Years of comfort eating meant she felt she had to hide her hulking frame under size 32 clothing. She said: 'I found it hard to leave the house. I struggled to breathing and was constantly anxious. I was hard to get out of bed in the morning. I did not want to face the world. 'Going up the stairs left me exhausted. I couldn't go to the shops and I was tired all the time. I was sick of the way things were going and I decided I couldn't wallow in self-pity for the rest of my life. I needed a change.' Depressed: Miss Lawton said she had struggled with her weight but after her surgery has swapped junk food and sitting still for a new healthy diet and regular exercise . In February 2012 Miss Lawton was fitted with a gastric band. Over the course of 18 months she dropped to the 10st 7lb, size 12 she is today. She said: 'People think a gastric band is an easy fix, but it is not. 'You can't sit there and eat McDonalds all day and hope to lose weight. You need to work hard and change your lifestyle. You need to exercise and watch what you eat. 'You have to be focussed, you have to be in the right frame of mind. You need to commit to the weight loss 100 per cent.' As soon as she recovered from her gastric band surgery Miss Lawton began a gruelling exercise regime which included daily floor exercises, power-walking, and using an exercise bike at home. She kept her diet in check by swapping crisps, sweets and spaghetti bolognese for lean meat, fresh vegetables and fruit.","Beckie Lawton, who weighed up to 30st, has dropped to 20st in two years .

"McDonald's on Tuesday released another video focused on improving public perceptions of their fast food products--this time with a focus on the Chicken McNugget. The video is a step-by-step look at the making of the deep-fried morsels that seems specifically designed to fix misconceptions that McDonald's uses so-called 'pink slime' meat in its nuggets. Along with a similar video about the McRib, the campaign is pushing to change its reputation as unhealthy snack food in a country where people increasingly want options that feel more wholesome. Scroll down for video . What's in a Chicken McNugget: Not pink slime and McDonald's really wants that to be apparent in a new how-it's-made video . Likewise, its a bid for the company to improve its bottom line. On Tuesday, the Oak Brook, Illinois-based company announced a 4.6 percent decline in sales at locations open at least 13 months. Nearly as soon as the McNuggets video begins inside a Tyson chicken factory, the video's host whips out an iPad that shows the picture of pink goo oozing out of a tube that nauseated readers across the internet starting in 2012. 'I don't know where that picture came from, but that's not used in Chicken McNuggets,' says the Tyson staffer charged with giving the tour. instead of the chemically separated garbage, the cameras show teams of Tyson employees studiously hacking away at whole chickens on the factory line. What they're left with in the next step are the breast, rib meat, dark meat and skin. Only the white meat goes into Chicken McNuggets, says the tourguide. Chicken factory: The video comes after a how-it's-made McRib Edition, which came out last month. it takes place inside a chicken factory . 'No beaks? No feet?': The Tyson tour guide shows all white meat that goes into McNuggets, plus a little skin 'for flavor' Not pink slime: 'We grind it to give you that really meaty texture that you expect in Chicken McNuggets,' says the tour guide . 'This is the only part of the chicken that goes into the Chicken McNuggets,' asks the McDonald's video host. 'Nothing else? No beaks, no feet? The tour guide gives an emphatic 'No' and it's on to the grinder. There, both the host and tour guide are sure to point out that the ground product does not look slimey at all. 'We grind it to give you that really meaty texture that you expect in Chicken McNuggets,' says the tour guide. Before the nuggets are formed into their iconic shapes, they get mixed with ingredients like flavor enhancers, moisture enhancers and preservatives. A triple-step breading and battering process, that last of which imbues the nuggets with their decided golden hue and peppery/celery notes, comes next. Then flash fry, freeze and voila! White Boneless Chicken, Water, Food Starch-Modified, Salt, Seasoning (Autolyzed Yeast Extract, Salt, Wheat Starch, Natural Flavoring [Botanical Source], Safflower Oil, Dextrose, Citric Acid), Sodium Phosphates, Natural Flavor (Botanical Source).

McDonald's McNuggets meat pictured in a mixer as the other ingredients like flavor enhancers and preservatives are added . Then company responded to outrage that emerged from a photo that showed the McRibs meat prior to being cooked in a similar way. Both come out, no doubt, of the company's need to improve public perceptions of its product and with them its bottom line. The world's largest hamburger chain said Monday the drop in global sales at locations open at least 13 months included a 4.6 percent decline in the U.S. and a 4 percent decline for the unit that includes the Asia-Pacific region, the Middle East and Africa. In its flagship U.S. market, McDonald's Corp. is facing with a number of challenges, including increased competition and changing eating habits, with places such as Chipotle gaining in popularity. Industry analysts say the attraction of places like Chipotle is in part that people can better customize their orders. As McDonald's continues to struggle in the U.S., CEO Don Thompson has conceded the company hasn't done enough to keep up with shifting habits. In October, he said changes are in store for its U.S. restaurants, including the simplification of its menu. Three breading steps: The shaped nuggets then pass through a thin curtain of batter and then get breaded . The final batter step gives the nuggets their signature golden hue, it appears . Et, voila: The nuggets are given a quick flash fry just to harden the batter, then frozen and shipped to a McDonald's near you .","The world's largest hamburger restaurant on Tuesday released a new video that gives a step by step how-it's-made at a Tyson plant .

"Five men who were wrongfully jailed for the 1986 rape of a Central Park jogger are pursuing $52 million in damages from the state in the Court of Claims. It comes just six months after the men - Antron McCray, Kevin Richardson, Yusef Salaam, Raymond Santana and Kharey Wise, who are known as the 'Central Park Five' - won a landmark $41 million settlement from the city. The men, now in their late 30s and early 40s, were wrongly convicted of the vicious rape of a jogger in 1989 - and agreed on a $40 million settlement with the city of New York in June. The resolution marked the end of a 12-year legal battle the five men have fought after they spent years in prison as a result of the attack which shocked the nation and led in part to the implementation of Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's clean up of New York City. From left, Korey Wise, Antron McCray, Kevin Richardson, Raymond Santana, and Yusef Salaam, pictured in 2012 in New York City, settled for $40 million for their wrongful conviction for the rape of a 28-year-old woman in Central Park in 1989 but are now seeking a further payout . But now, they are seeking a further payout and Raymond Santana said it was justified. 'When you have a person who has been exonerated of a crime, the city provides no services to transition him back to society,' he told The New York Daily News. 'The only thing left is something like this — so you can receive some type of money so you can survive.' The men initially filed a $250 million civil-rights lawsuit after the overturn of their false convictions in 2002 for acting as a 'wolf pack' of 'wilding' youths who attacked 28-year-old jogger Trisha Meili in 1989. The five men were tried and found guilty of the rape of the investment banker and all served prison time. In this April 22, 1989 file photo, Yusef Salaam, 15, second from left, and Raymond Santana, 14, right, are led from the 24th Precinct by a detective after their arrest in connection with the rape and severe beating of a woman jogging in Central Park . She was in a coma for 12 days and was left with permanent damage and no memory of the attack. All the men were aged 14 to 16 at the time of their arrest and it was alleged police brutality forced confessions from them. They also argued at the time that key DNA evidence was ignored during their trial which would have triggered a not guilty verdict. The five black and Hispanic men had their convictions overturned in December 2002, when an investigation discovered DNA proof they had not raped her, but that she was attacked by one lone man. Matias Reyes, a convicted rapist already in prison, confessed to acting alone in the assault and the men were freed. The agreed a deal, which must be approved by the city comptroller, averages out at roughly $1 million for each year of imprisonment for the five men. That means that Kharey Wise, who spent 13 years in prison, will receive the largest single payout New York City has made in a wrongful conviction case. The other four men all served around seven years in prison. The men are all in their late 30s or early 40s now and New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio was said to be keen to have the case settled. This was in direct contrast to former Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who argued the original $250 million suit was too high because authorities had acted in good faith. According to the New York Times, the city's Law Department backed this opinion at the time. 'The case is not about whether the teens were wrongly convicted,' a department spokeswoman said. 'It's about whether prosecutors and police deliberately engaged in misconduct.' The attack on Trisha Meili occurred on April 19, 1989. It was one of the most notorious crimes in New York City history and it mesmerized the nation, serving as a lurid symbol of the city's racial and class divide and its rampant crime. It gave rise to the term 'wilding' for urban mayhem by teenagers. 'Drugs. Guns. Gangs. New York City was just crime central at that time,' said former New York Detective Kirk Burkhalter, recalling an era so blood-soaked that the city had a record 2,245 homicides in 1990, compared with 414 in 2012. 'You were scared to ride the trains after dark. It was such a different place.' Trisha Meili was out jogging in Central Park on April 19, 1989, when she was bound, gagged, raped and beaten nearly to death, a chilling crime to which five teenage boys confessed after hours of interrogation by New York City police. From the start, the rape of a 28-year-old white woman in the park drew intense media coverage and led to the term 'wilding' to describe gangs of youths terrorizing random passersby. The five were convicted in 1990 based on the confessions, delivered after interrogations that in some cases lasted overnight. Twelve years later, Matias Reyes, a murderer and serial rapist who had attacked a woman in the park two days before Meili's assault, confessed to the crime, and DNA testing tied him to the rape. In a 2002 report recommending the convictions be vacated, prosecutor Nancy Ryan concluded that the boys' confessions contained 'troubling discrepancies' and that Reyes' description of the attack matched the crime scene. A judge vacated the convictions. By then, however, the boys had already been released after serving sentences ranging from five years to 13 years. In 2002, NYPD Commissioner Raymond Kelly appointed a panel to produce its own report, which concluded that the boys likely attacked Meili before Reyes did. Former prosecutor Michael Armstrong, who co-authored the report, said Ryan erred in dismissing the boys' confessions entirely. 'It seems impossible to say that they weren't there at all, because they knew too much,' he said in an interview. Lawyers for the plaintiffs said the belief that the boys are guilty is pervasive among the dozens of police officers who have been deposed. 'They protect each other,' said Jane Fisher-Byrialsen, a lawyer for the five. 'It's always like this.' However, in prison, three of the men, Richardson, Salaam and Santan said they were innocent but acknowledged they were in the park committing assualts - but not rape. Mr. Santana indicated in his hearing that the larger group was out to rob people. 'I took part in with the beatings of that man,' he said. 'If I could go back in time and not do it again, you know, it would have been a whole different story.' The men's lawyers have long said that their clients committed no crimes in the park that night. When Meili was found in the brush, more than 75 percent of her blood had drained from her body and her skull was smashed. She later went public as a motivational speaker and wrote a book. Raymond Santana and Kevin Richardson, both 14 at the time, Antron McCray and Salaam, 15, and Korey Wise, 16, were rounded up and arrested. After hours of interrogation, four of them recorded confessions on video, in some cases with the boys' parents in the room. Bravery: Trisha Meili, The Central Park Jogger published a book about her harrowing experience - waiving her anonymity to reveal her recovery and the trauma she experienced . At the trials, their lawyers argued the confessions were coerced and at the time, DNA testing was not sophisticated enough to make or break the case. In 2002, a re-examination of the case found that DNA on the victim's sock pointed to Matias Reyes, a murderer and serial rapist who confessed that he alone attacked the jogger. Then-District Attorney Robert Morgenthau stopped short of declaring the Central Park Five innocent but withdrew all charges and did not seek a retrial. (The statute of limitations for charging Reyes had run out; he is serving a life sentence for other crimes.) Roger Wareham, one of the lawyers for the five, said the DNA was the key. 'There was never any forensic evidence that tied them to this case,' he said. 'In 1989, everybody might not have been forensic savvy, but now, after 'Law and Order,' everybody knows if there's no DNA, they didn't do it.' But an overturned conviction does not automatically mean there was any wrongdoing by prosecutors or police. Legal experts said the case took a long time in part because of the money and reputations at stake. The two-hour documentary, 'The Central Park Five,' made the case that the men were wrongly convicted. The film uses extensive interviews with the men and their families, and lawyers for the city went to court to demand outtakes for use in the civil case. The defendants' lives since they got out of prison have not been easy. Wise was recently re-arrested. McCray moved away. Santana sold drugs and was sent back to prison, but now, along with Richardson and Salaam, has become the public face of the case, speaking out against wrongful convictions and racial profiling.","Five wrongfully convicted men won a landmark settlement in June this year .

"Ed Miliband yesterday said he had never taken illegal drugs – but added that he had ‘read about’ the effects of cannabis. The Labour leader said he was opposed to the decriminalisation of drugs, including cannabis, warning it would send out a dangerous message to young people. Mr Miliband was asked about his attitude towards drugs during an online question and answer Leaders Live discussion with young people, produced by Bite the Ballot with ITV News. Ed Miliband said he had never taken illegal drugs – but added that he had ‘read about’ the effects of cannabis . Asked whether he had ever experimented with drugs, he said: ‘I have not taken drugs… but I have read about it.’ Mr Miliband said Government should ‘always be looking at the way we discourage young people from taking drugs.’ He went on: ‘I’m not in favour of decriminalisation of, for example, cannabis. 'I think there are mental effects of cannabis that people maybe didn’t realise a decade ago.’ Mr Miliband said Labour was still finalising plans to promise a cut in university tuition fees at next year’s election. And he said an incoming Labour government would consider changing the law to prevent a planned 10 per cent pay rise for MPs. He announced that 16 and 17-year-olds will be allowed to vote within a year of the next election. Mr Miliband said the government would change the law to lower the voting age from May 2016. Such a move – the first change in the national voting age since 1969 – would enfranchise more than 1.5million 16 and 17-year-olds. It comes after the voting age was lowered for the first time in the Scottish referendum in September. Mr Miliband said he is opposed to decriminalisation of drugs warning it sends out a'dangerous' message to young people - adding Government should ‘always be looking'  at the ways they can discourage young people . During a YouTube debate Mr Miliband said: ‘Too many young people are turning their backs on politics which is bad for our country and bad for them too. ‘That’s because too often young people don’t get a look-in with politicians who know they can’t vote - or assume that they won’t vote. ‘The measures we will introduce in our first year of government represent the greatest extension of the franchise in my lifetime. ‘But it is not enough just to give young people the right to vote. We must do everything we can to ensure they have the chance to exercise it.' Mr Miliband, who has long been a supporter of an earlier voting age, is expected to use a speech at next week’s party conference to pledge that the policy will be included in his general election manifesto. Party sources believe that idealistic youngsters are more likely to vote Labour. The idea is also backed by the Liberal Democrats. The voting age in Britain was reduced from 21 to 18 in 1969. Conservative Party chairman Grant Shapps has previously dismissed calls to lower the voting age to 16 when the issue was raised last year.","Ed Miliband said he's never taken illegal drugs - but has read about effects .

"Dr Steven Forde followed a young woman wearing a mini skirt around a city centre, using a James Bond-style spy camera to film her legs, a tribunal heard . A senior doctor who followed a young woman dressed in a mini skirt around a city centre and filmed her using a secret camera hidden in his satchel 'had intended to take pictures of forest scenery', a tribunal heard. Dr Steven Forde, a consultant anaesthetist, was spotted acting suspiciously in York by a security guard, who called in support from the police. When asked what he was doing, Dr Forde, a former RAF medic who once served in Bosnia and Kosovo, is said to have admitted he had been filming the woman for five minutes, using a telescopic lens which protruded through a concealed hole at the bottom of the bag. The married father-of-three, who works at York District Hospital, also told officers that he had filmed women secretively before and that he had a stash of images at home, a medical tribunal heard today. A remote switch used to control the camera was found in the bag's front pocket, it was said. Dr Forde, from Haxby, near York, appeared today for the beginning of a Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service fitness to practice hearing in Manchester, where he faces suspension from the medical register if the allegation of misconduct is proved and deemed to have been sexually motivated. Admitting he had filmed the woman, he told the hearing that he had originally meant to take pictures of trees. 'I was looking for forest scenery. I wanted spring flowers, that sort of scene. I then went to the city centre,' he said. The doctor, 45, claimed the incident followed three 'stressful events' in his professional life, including a a formal complaint made against him by a patient who said he was 'rude and aggressive'. He said he had to give evidence at the GMC after a medical student he was in charge of continued onto third year even though he hadn't been signed off. In a third incident he said he had to help transfer a three-week-old baby to Leeds hospital but the baby died. He said: 'I felt like my whole world had collapsed and this was the end and that's it. 'I found the experience one of the most stressful things I've ever done. Those legal practises - most of us are not used to this sort of environment. It doesn't justify what I did, but in my mind the stresses inhibited me from dealing with the behaviour that was causing this.' Explaining how he filmed the young woman, he said: 'I had the camera with me. I only took one lens. It is the lens for pictures in the medium to far distance. 'The camera was in the bottom of the bag. It was a messenger type bag with a side pouch and the camera in the bottom with an aperture cut at the front of the bag for the lens to see through and the lens was covered by a filter and there was a digital viewfinder plugged into the camera and that was hidden in the side pouch.' When asked by his lawyer Mark Ainsworth why the lens was covered by a filter and looking through the front of the bag, he added: 'To conceal the end of it so if somebody looked they wouldn't see what was behind it.' The bag used by Dr Forde, who works at York Hospital (pictured) but is currently suspended, contained a camera with a telescopic lens, a medical tribunal was told . He said he used the video mode on his camera to take moving footage and added: 'I took footage of a woman walking down the pavement through the centre of town. 'The security didn't see me recording the footage at the time but I had already recorded it before he saw me stop on the corner of the street. I went to record a woman walking towards me and I stopped and started to set up the camera up to record. 'It was quite a long sequence I had to go through to switch it on and start recording, switch the viewfinder on and try and find the subject then focus manually with my hand in the bag. So I had gone through this and by which time had changed my mind and decided not to film. I switched it off and carried on walking. 'Then I saw a man run across the street shouting ""I'm detaining you for voyeurism"" and I believed he must have been watching me earlier in the day when I had recorded the footage. He saw me fiddling with my bag and then I switched it off. 'The phrase legs, skirt and body came from the security man. He told police that's what I was filming but I was also recording her hands, head, feet, fingers - it was a full-length video.' He accepted he hadn't asked the woman for her permission to take the film. Dr Forde was originally charged with outraging public decency by using the concealed camera to take pictures of the woman's legs without her consent. However, he was acquitted of the charge on the day of his trial when prosecutors offered no evidence. Admitting he had filmed the woman, Dr Forde told the tribunal that he had originally meant to take pictures of 'forest scenery' Representing the General Medical Council (GMC), Natasha Tahta said: 'On May 9 last year, Dr Forde was seen by a security guard in York city centre acting suspiciously. 'He was found with a satchel canvas bag which had been adapted to contain a camera with a telescopic lens which protruded between a concealed hole at the bottom. There was a hand-held remote fire switch in the front pouch. 'Two police community support officers attended and they found Dr Forde carrying the bag containing the hidden camera with the telescopic lens and spoke to him. He admitted that he had been filming a young lady for about five minutes and he had done this before and had more images of other females at home. 'In due course he was charged with an offence of outraging public decency then acquitted when the CPS offered no evidence. 'The conduct amounts to misconduct as he videoed the legs and skirt and the lady was in a public place.' Dr Forde, who qualified as a doctor in 1991, was suspended  from practicing as a doctor on an interim basis by the GMC after the allegation was made. He qualified as an anaesthetist in 1999 and for several years has held a post in York Hospital's anaesthetics department. He has also worked at York's Clifton Park Hospital. The doctor will give evidence this afternoon. The hearing continues.

"Radio DJ Neil 'Dr' Fox has been re-arrested on suspicion of three  sexual assaults. It comes two months after the former Pop Idol judge was first arrested at the Magic FM offices in London following four earlier allegations of sexual assault against two women. The 53-year-old presenter, known as Doctor Fox, was questioned today over a further three alleged sexual assaults involving different women after he returned to a London police station on bail. Radio DJ Neil 'Dr' Fox, who is facing four sexual assault allegations, has been arrested on suspicion of three further sexual assaults. The 53-year-old was questioned at a central London police station today . He said he 'strenuously' denied the allegations after he was questioned by officers. Speaking to ITV News, Fox said: '(I'm) obviously extremely upset about these allegations. (I) strenuously deny these allegations. '(I've been) with my legal team this afternoon trying to answer the police questions as best we possibly can, of course, and helping them as much as we can. 'Apart from that it is probably inappropriate that I say anything else at the moment.' Two of the latest allegations, which involve different women, are said have happened in the 1990s, and the third is said to have happened in 2007. He has been bailed to a date in March 2015. Mr Fox was first arrested on Tuesday, September 30, following four allegations of sexual assault against two women, including three 'non-recent' allegations and one from earlier this year. Mr Fox was first held by detectives on September 30 at the Magic FM offices in London just moments after coming off-air. A spokesman for Bauer Media, which owns Magic FM, did not comment on his latest arrest . He was questioned for more than seven hours over four alleged offences relating to two women. Three of the earlier claims are historic and the fourth relates to an incident earlier this year. Officers subsequently searched addresses in Fulham, west London and in the area of Littlehampton, West Sussex. A spokeswoman for the Metropolitan Police did not name the broadcaster, but confirmed that a 53-year-old man had been arrested today for a further three alleged sexual assaults involving three different women. A spokesman for Bauer Media, which owns Magic FM, said: 'We have no comment to make on what is a police matter.' Fox (far right) is perhaps best known as one of the judges on Pop Idol alongside Simon Cowell, Pete Waterman and Nicki Chapman. He has also presented a Channel 5 show based on the Top 40 Chart . Following Fox's arrest in September, the company said the presenter would be off air 'to enable him to devote his full attention to dealing with these matters'. A spokeswoman for Fox declined to comment. Mr Fox, who is known by nicknames 'Doctor Fox' and 'Foxy, started his career in local radio before moving the Radio Luxembourg and later Capital FM. There he presented in a number of slots, rising to fame as a DJ in the early 1990s. In 1993 he was given the job of hosting the Pepsi Network Chart on Sunday afternoon. The Top 40 show soared in popularity and at one time had a bigger audience than its Radio 1 rival. He was later rumoured to have been offered the coveted breakfast slot on Radio 1, following the departure of Chris Evans. Earlier this month Neil Fox hosted Magic FM's London's Biggest Breakfast which was attended by Mayor Boris Johnson, who hosted a breakfast club at the event. He joined the commercial radio station in 2005 . Fox went on to present a Channel 5 TV show based around the Pepsi Top 40 Chart and has won numerous awards throughout his career. But he is perhaps best known as one of the judges on Pop Idol, a forerunner of X Factor, alongside Simon Cowell, Pete Waterman and Nicki Chapman. The series ran on ITV from 2001 to 2003 and set the format of TV talent shows based on audience voting for the next decade. Two years later Fox took the breakfast show chair on 105.4 Magic FM and has remained there ever since. A spokeswoman for the Metropolitan Police said: 'On Tuesday, 30 September, officers from Westminster arrested a 53-year-old man following four allegations of sexual assault against two women. ‘Three of the allegations are non-recent, one is from earlier this year. ‘The man was arrested at a business address and taken to a central London police station. ‘On Monday, 8 December, he returned on bail to a central London police station and was arrested for a further three sexual assaults involving different women. ‘The man has now been bailed to return pending further enquiries to a date in March 2015.’ Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","DJ Neil Fox has been arrested on suspicion of three sexual assaults .

"All Eurostar trains travelling from London to Brussels have been cancelled due to anti-austerity strikes in Belgium.

Around 44 per cent of flights are also cancelled from Brussels' main airports as protests ground the country to a halt. Trade unionists in Belgium are striking against government austerity plans impacting all transport . Picket lines are blocking the entrance to industrial areas and workplaces, such as this Audi factory . Labour union leaders have also shut down Eurostar services from Brussels to Paris and other European destinations, as well as the high-speed Thalys train service. Metro, bus and tram services in Brussels have also been closed as a result of the planned strikes. The one-day strike is the third in a series of weekly union actions intended to force the government of Prime Minister Charles Michel to backtrack on a program to reform pensions, cut health and social security budgets and raise the retirement age. Even more travellers are expected to be effected by a general strike throughout Belgium on December 15 that is expected to grind the entire country to a halt.

'Due to a National Strike in Belgium on the 8th and 15th December 2014, Eurostar services on the Brussels route will only be able to operate to and from Lille Europe on that day,' a statement said. 'Due to the scale of the strike we expect no trains or other public transport to run in Belgium. Eurostar are unable to provide any alternative method of transport between Brussels and Lille and we strongly advise our passengers not to travel on these dates.

"Seven beached sperm whales have died on Yorke Peninsula in South Australia after getting into trouble during a low tide. Locals believe that the whales washed ashore on Sunday night while on the hunt for salmon and became stranded when the tide went out. The whales were found  50m offshore at Parara Beach, about 4km south of Ardrossan. Scroll down for video . Seven beached sperm whales have been confirmed dead on Yorke Peninsula in South Australia after getting into trouble during a low tide . Unfortunately, six were dead, with a seventh whale dying later today. A fisherman also spotted an eighth sperm whale in shallow water north of the silo jetty today. The whale was apparently ushered back out to sea by rescuers from the Environment Department. The trained staff were able to coax the huge whale into deeper water and prevent another death. Australian Department of Environment, Water and Natural Resources Animal Welfare manager Deb Kelly with  standing in front of one of six sperm whales washed up dead in a rare mass stranding on the South Australia coast . Speaking to the ABC, Ardrossan caravan park manager Steve Ruddock said he smelt the whales before her saw them and revealed that some of them were splashing in the shallow water, desperately trying to reach deeper waters. 'Because they are so fresh, there's no smell, but it won't be long until they get on the nose, I'd say,' he said. 'There's three that are about that size, and the other three are a fraction smaller,' he said. 'We talked to a lot of the locals and there's been the odd sighting now and then on the sea, but this is very unusual,' Mr Ruddock said. Environment Department regional co-ordinator Grant Pelton told Adelaide Now that the eighth whale was deeply distressed and was very close to breaching. 'DEWNR staff and a Department of Transport, Planning and Infrastructure Marine Safety officer located a live seven-metre sperm whale in 1.5 metres of water at Pt Vincent,' regional co-ordinator he said. Locals believe that the whales washed ashore last night, while on the hunt for salmon and became stranded when the tide went out . 'The animal was very lethargic but after some time they managed to encourage it out into deeper water where it dived and they haven't seen it since. They will remain in the area to confirm it doesn't come into the shallows again.' Experts believe that there could be many explanations as to why the whales got into trouble. One such theory is that one of the whales was sick and went into shallow water, when it felt better it may have called for help from the rest of the pod. Another explanation may be that the pod were chasing food and got caught in the low tide. The whales were found 50m offshore at Parara Beach, about 4km south of Ardrossan . Environment Department animal welfare manager Dr Deborah Kelly was distressed to see the whales on the beach. 'This is rare,' Dr Kelly said. 'Unfortunately things like this have been happening for thousands of years.' Twitter users have taken to their social media accounts to express their shock at the freak event . Twitter has been set alight byt the mass death of seven whales in Ardrossan . It is still uncertain when the whales will be removed from the beach. With each whale weighing up to 50 tonnes the task may take a while. The Environment Department is hoping that post-mortems on the whales will lead to an explanation. A witness at the scene told the Advertiser that the whales covered an area of about 500m. A fisherman also spotted an eighth sperm whale in shallow water north of the silo jetty today.The whale was apparently ushered back out to sea by rescuers from the Environment Department . The witness said that one of the whales was still flapping it's tail this morning at 8am, but stopped a short while later. The National Marine Mammal Laboratory say male sperm whales can grow up to 60 feet and may live to be 50-70-years-old. They say that while sperm whales typically die of natural causes, they are known to mass strand. Twitter users have taken to their social media accounts to express their shock at the freak event.

"A number of politicians have described wind farms as a blight on the landscape – a sight so 'appalling', they could slash the value of your home by a third. But new market research in Canada has revealed that these towering turbines have no effect on property values of nearby homes, commercial properties or farms. The researchers hope that their unexpected results may help resolve some heated debates about the use of wind farms near residential areas. Hot air: New market research in Canada has revealed that towering wind turbines have no effect on property values of nearby homes, commercial properties or farms . The study, by the University of Guelph, looked at more than 7,000 homes and farm sales in 11 townships in Ontario, Canada. This included Melancthon, which is home to one of Ontario's first and largest wind farms after 133 turbines were erected there between 2005 and 2008. Researchers looked at sales data over an eight-year period - from 2002 to 2010 - to capture property values before, during and after the wind farm's development. During that period, more than 1,000 homes and farms were resold - some multiple times. And in every case, they found wind farms had 'no statistically significant effect' on property values. The study ontradicts research earlier this year by the London School of Economics (LSE) which found that values of homes within 1.2 miles (1.9km) of large wind farms were being slashed by about 11 per cent . The researchers had expected to find a negative correlation, especially for residential properties. 'This may help address the controversy that exists in Ontario regarding the impact of wind turbines on property values,' researcher Richard Vyn said. Last year, Geoffrey Cox, Conservative MP for West Devon and Torridge, said some homes in his area are now worth 'significantly less' thanks to giant turbines, and that it is an 'injustice' that homeowners should lose out while developers and land owners potentially pocket millions. Mr Cox says proposals for scores of turbines have pushed rural areas to 'tipping point' and has called for a new scheme to compensate those whose homes are affected. The MP said: 'An increasing number of people are coming to me with clear evidence that the value of their home is significantly less than what it otherwise would be were the wind farm not there.' He added: 'I’m seeing a minimum 10 per cent to 15 per cent reduction. Some are seeing a loss of one-third of the value... How can that be fair?' 'How can it be right that landowners and developers are making millions of pounds, while the ordinary household is losing the value of what is their pension, or nest egg in old age.' A current court battle in Ontario about wind energy developments involves families in Huron County and the K2 Wind Energy Power Project. Across the province, residents have called on the government to delay wind farm development until the impacts are better understood. But similar opposition to wind farms is taking place across the world. In the UK for instance, nearly 25,000 objections were lodged against proposals to build wind turbines the 'size of skyscrapers' across Scotland. 'It's been in the news for a while now, and it seems to be generating more and more concerns among local residents,' said Vyn. 'I wanted to see whether the stories people are telling and the concerns that they are expressing show up in the sales data.' This research, which was recently published in the journal Canadian Journal of Agricultural Economics, is the first peer-reviewed study on the subject. It contradicts research earlier this year by the London School of Economics (LSE) which found that values of homes within 1.2 miles (1.9km) of large wind farms were being slashed by about 11 per cent. The study looked at more than a million sales of properties close to wind farm sites over a 12-year period. This means that if such a wind farm were near an average house in Britain, which now costs almost £250,000 ($391,100), it would lose more than £27,000 ($42,250) in value.","Study, by the University of Guelph, looked at more than 7,000 homes .

"There were no plans by Prime Minister Tony Abbott to send any of his ministers to global climate negotiations in Peru this week but Julie Bishop quickly got that changed. Initially, a proposal by the deputy leader of the Liberal Party, to represent Australia at the overseas summit was blocked but Ms Bishop pressed on and eventually got her way after the full cabinet supported her bid. The Sydney Morning Herald says the minister for Foreign Affairs will arrive in Peru's capital, Lima, on Tuesday to meet with close to 200 other countries. She will talk international climate policy ahead of next year's 2015 Paris conference, which is being held to achieve a universal agreement on climate change, from all the nations of the world. There were no plans by Prime Minister Tony Abbott (pictured left) to send any of his ministers to global climate negotiations in Peru this week but an uproar by Julie Bishop (pictured right) saw the decision reversed . The effort to bypass Prime Minister Tony Abbott (pictured) on global climate talks in Peru, shows evidence of latest tensions brewing in the government between Mr Abbott and his ministers. A recent poll has also shown voters lack confidence in the government on climate change . It's believed the request was approved only on the proviso Ms Bishop take another minister with her as a 'chaperone' which is trade minister Andrew Robb. In an interview with the Australian Financial Review before leaving, Ms Bishop said Australia needed to be represented at a ministerial level at the summit to show the country was taking the negotiations seriously. 'I think we need some successful outcomes, or some solid outcomes to set everyone up for productive negotiations throughout 2015 for an effective agreement at the end of the year,' she said. The effort to bypass the Prime Minister shows evidence of latest tensions brewing in the government between Mr Abbott and his ministers, also coming at a time where voters are lacking confidence in the party on climate change.

Julie Bishop (pictured left) went to the cabinet to get her proposal to travel to Peru for a climate change conference approved . A recent Fairfax poll found that more than half (57%) of Australians thought the government was doing 'too little' on the issue. Government attempts to play down climate change at the G20 summit recently held in Brisbane also backfired with the issue being highlighted even more. The Sydney Morning Herald has revealed that despite ministers repeatedly warning the Prime Minister's office against trying to shut down climate change discussions, advice was ignored. The re-visiting of Ms Bishops proposal to travel to Lima was a clear demonstration the cabinet wanted to get it right on climate change and put the controversial issue on the agenda unlike the G20.","A proposal by Julie Bishop, originally blocked, to travel to Peru for climate change talks was approved .

"The parents of Dark Knight shooter James Holmes appeared anguished as they entered a pre-trial hearing on Monday as a judge considered delaying proceedings in their son's case. Arlene and Robert Holmes attended the pre-trial readiness hearing in Centennial, Colorado along with survivors of their son's killing spree which left 12 people dead. Among the survivors was Josh Nolan, who used a cane as he walked into the courthouse. Mr Nolan was shot in the arm and leg during the theater shooting in Aurora, on July 20, 2012.

The judge in the Colorado theater shooting case could delay the trial yet again after defense attorneys said on Monday they need more time due to medical emergencies involving members of their team. James Holmes' defense attorneys said at a hearing that the medical problems, involving an attorney and an investigator, have complicated their review of a massive amount of evidence and preparations for the long-awaited trial, which has been postponed five times. Jury selection is scheduled to start on January 20. Attorneys discussed the medical issues privately with Judge Carlos A. Samour Jr. for nearly 30 minutes but did not disclose them in court. 'We're trying to jam all this work into a small amount of time at the end of this proceeding that has lasted more than two years,' defense attorney Daniel King told the judge. Holmes pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity to charges of killing 12 people and injuring 70 in the 2012 attack at a Denver-area theater. Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty. In court filings last week, defense attorneys had asked for a two-to-three month delay to review evidence that includes 85,000 pages of documents, 366 CDs, 282 DVDs and other materials in computer memory drives. King said Monday that expert witnesses are still studying the material, namely a sanity evaluation that includes more than 20 hours of interviews with Holmes and 5,000 pages of documents from the state mental hospital where it took place. Prosecutors and some of the victims have said they oppose any further delay. Jury selection alone is expected to last five months, with Samour sending summonses to 9,000 prospective jurors.

"The UN has appealed for $16.4billion (£10.4billion) to provide aid to nearly 60 million people worldwide next year, with almost half the amount aimed at helping victims of Syria's drawn-out conflict. 'The rising scale of need is outpacing our capacity to respond,' warned United Nations humanitarian chief Valerie Amos, stressing that 2014 has been marked by a sharp rise in the number of people affected by violent conflicts. The global appeal from UN agencies and other humanitarian organisations aims to gather funds to help at least 57.5 million of the most vulnerable across 22 countries. The global appeal from UN agencies and other humanitarian organisations aims to gather funds to help at least 57.5 million of the most vulnerable across 22 countries. Syria is earmarked for $7.2billion, Ukraine $189million and Afghanistan $405million. Iraq, meanwhile, should receive $1.2billion, the organisation said . The UN says that $2.8billion is needed to help those caught in the Syrian civil war. PIctured is a Syrian boy being treated at a makeshift hospital in the rebel-held Damascus suburb of Douma . An injured Syrian man sits at the makeshift hospital in Douma following two reported air strikes by government forces . The appeal is calling for $2.8bn to help 12.2m people inside  war-ravaged Syria next year. Pictured is the Syrian border town of Kobane, where Isis is battling Kurdish fighters whose cause is aided by Coalition air strikes . Monday's appeal did not however include the needs in Djibouti and the nine countries in Africa's Sahel region, including Nigeria and Mali, which will be addressed in a separate appeal in February, the UN said. A full $7.2billion of the amount requested for 2015 will be aimed at helping an estimated 18.2 million people victimised by Syria's bloody civil war, which erupted in March 2011. The appeal is calling for $2.8billion to help 12.2million people inside the war-ravaged country next year, including 7.6million people who have been internally displaced. Another $4.4 million will be needed to help more than three million Syrian refugees and some three million vulnerable people in overwhelmed host communities in neighbouring countries, the appeal said.

This graphic shows how the UN wants the aid distributed - with 18.2million people in Syria receiving the lion's share of the money . Helping millions of people affected by other crises will also require a large cash injection next year, with Syria's neighbour Iraq figuring high on the list. The crises in Central African Republic and South Sudan are also listed in the appeal, as is the spiralling conflict in eastern Ukraine. Crises in Afghanistan, Democratic Republic of Congo, Myanmar, the occupied Palestinian territories, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen will also require funds next year. 'This is not business as usual in the humanitarian world,' said Antonio Guterres, head of the UN refugee agency. The amount requested for 2015 dwarfs the $12.9billion requested last December in the initial appeal for 2014. Throughout a year that has seen millions more people flee violence and become dependent on aid to survive, those need estimates have since swelled to $17.9billion to help over 76 million people. Only 52 percent of that updated appeal has been funded, the UN said, highlighting a growing gap between needs and the resources available to cover them. However, Amos announced that an emergency appeal to the public had closed a $64-million funding shortfall that caused the UN World Food Programme last week to suspend food aid to 1.7 million Syrian refugees. Earlier Russia demanded an explanation for Israeli airstrikes on two areas near Damascus, while the Syrian and Iranian foreign ministers called it an act of aggression that proves Israel was 'in the same trench' with extremist groups fighting the Syrian government. Israeli warplanes struck near Damascus' international airport on Sunday, as well as outside a town close to the Lebanese border. The attacks are unlikely to have a big impact. Israel has already struck inside Syria on several occasions in the course of the country's chaotic civil war, including a series of airstrikes near Damascus in May 2013. Those strikes, according to Israeli officials, targeted shipments of Iranian-made Fateh-110 missiles bound for Israel's arch foe - the Lebanese Hezbollah militant group. Syria's reaction has been relatively mute; in previous cases, Damascus has vowed to retaliate without carrying out any such action. The Syrian government said Sunday's attacks caused only material damage. Israel has not confirmed the strikes, and it was not immediately clear what they targeted, although activists said they hit weapons depots. The United Nations children's agency UNICEF declared 2014 a devastating year for children on Monday with as many as 15 million caught in conflicts in Central African Republic, Iraq, South Sudan, Syria, Ukraine and the Palestinian territories. UNICEF Executive Director Anthony Lake said the high number of crises meant many of them were quickly forgotten or failed to capture global headlines, such as in Afghanistan, Democratic Republic of Congo, Nigeria, Pakistan, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen. Globally, UNICEF said some 230 million children were living in countries and regions affected by armed conflict. 'Children have been killed while studying in the classroom and while sleeping in their beds; they have been orphaned, kidnapped, tortured, recruited, raped and even sold as slaves,' Lake said in a statement. 'Never in recent memory have so many children been subjected to such unspeakable brutality.' Significant threats also emerged to children's health and well-being like the deadly outbreak of Ebola in the West African countries Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, which has left thousands orphaned and some 5 million out of school. 'Violence and trauma do more than harm individual children - they undermine the strength of societies,' Lake said. In Central African Republic, where tit-for-tat sectarian violence has displaced one-fifth of the population, some 2.3 million children are affected by the conflict with up to 10,000 believed to have been recruited by armed groups during the past year and more than 430 killed or maimed, UNICEF said. Some 538 children were killed and 3,370 injured in the Palestinian Gaza Strip during a 50-day war between Israeli troops and Hamas militants, it said. In Syria, UNICEF said more than 7.3 million children have been affected by the civil war, including 1.7 million who fled the country. In neighboring Iraq an estimated 2.7 million children have been affected by conflict, it added, with at least 700 believed to have been maimed or killed this year. 'In both countries, children have been victims of, witnesses to and even perpetrators of increasingly brutal and extreme violence,' UNICEF said. Some 750,000 children have been displaced in South Sudan with 320,000 living as refugees. The United Nations said more than 600 children have been killed and more than 200 maimed this year, while some 12,000 are being used by armed groups.

"More than 100 puppies who were kept in such squalid conditions they were going deaf have been saved - after dog lovers raised more than $200,000. The spaniels were set to be auctioned off to puppy millers who planned to breed them for profit. But volunteers from Alabama launched a rescue bid and after donations from across the globe in just 11 days, 108 dogs have escaped the clutches of breeders. The pups, who were covered in fleas and their own waste, were crammed into cages and due to be auctioned off in in Wheaton, Missouri. More than 100 dogs were rescued from being auctioned off to breeders. Pictured, the spaniels at the puppy mill where many of them had gone blind and deaf from the poor conditions . Crammed into cages, the puppies were found covered in fleas and in their own waste in Alabama . Conditions were so poor that many were blind and deaf. But a group of Cavalier Spaniel owners, who call themselves 'the Cav Ladies'  launched 'Operation Cavalier' to raise funds and buy out the puppy sellers - and raised more than $220,000 from 2,050 donors. Organiser Angie Hubbard Ingram said: 'Our group had to do something to help these dogs. At this point, we had all become emotionally invested with the welfare of these dogs and had to find a way to save them.' Mrs Ingram and her daughter Kara as well as fellow dog lover Crys Carnes from Inverness, Alabama, formed groups to bid against the breeders on November 22. PR guru Amanda Ruisi, Lisa Thompson, Brittney Wilk, Lacelliese King, Crys Carnes, Kara Ingram and Angie Ingram also helped raise awareness and funds. But a group of dog lovers from Wheaton, Missouri, called 'the Cav Ladies', pictured, rescued them after raising $220,000 from donations . After they were saved by the kind volunteers, the dogs were transported to a vet to be treated . Almost 100 Cavalier King Charles Spaniels, pictured, were saved, as well as seven Shiba Inu, two Cocker Spaniels, a Shih Tzu, a French Bulldog and a Yorkshire Terrier . But with just three hours left, Mrs Ingram ran out of money, sparking an international plea for more cash to save the pups. Mrs Ingram said: 'We made a pact before ever going to the auction that we would spend every dime and do everything within our power to leave no pup behind. 'When we ran out of money after purchasing 30 or so dogs, I was devastated. 'We were in communication with all the volunteers and they put out a plea for money. Within thirty minutes, I was back in, bidding again and I had a minimum of $75,000 that had been dropped in to my PayPal account.' The donations saved 96 Cavalier King Charles Spaniels, seven Shiba Inu as well as two Cocker Spaniels, a Shih Tzu, a French Bulldog and one Yorkshire Terrier. The dogs were then treated by vets from nearby Caldwell Mill Animal Clinic in Birmingham, Alabama. And the volunteers have now launched a huge operation to find permanent homes for the dogs and hundreds of dog fanatics have offered to bring them home for Christmas. Mrs Carnes said: 'When it was all over, the emotion was so overwhelming. 'Angie and I were so relieved that we didn't know what to do.'

"Shoppers are frantically spending close to £500,000-a-minute online today as the rush to buy Christmas presents peaked on what experts call Manic Monday. Millions of shoppers will splurge around £110 each on average  with spending sprees expected to peak at around 7am this morning, at  Midday and finally around 9pm. Retailers said that Manic Monday - the second Monday in December has overtaken Cyber Monday - the first Monday in December - as the busiest internet shopping day in Britain. Amazon said today they are 'ready to pick, pack and deliver the millions of items that will be ordered' today with pictures  showing how their giant warehouse in Swansea is packed with goods and staff. The site is a quarter of a mile long from end to end and occupies 800,000 square feet -  the size of 11 football pitches - and is packed with thousands of workers. Scroll down for video .

Vast: Staff walk the site picking up goods from its giant shelves. It is a quarter of a mile long from end to end . UK consumers are expected to spend an astonishing £470,000 a minute on gifts - or £676million in total today on Christmas gifts for their friends and loved-ones. Cyber Monday has traditionally been the most popular day to order presents but the increase in same day delivery and click and collect services mean that people have waited another week before buying because they know they will get it in time for Christmas Day. Analysts believe that in total £4.7billion will be spent on online gifts this Christmas in Britain and the rise of Black Friday, Cyber Monday and Manic Monday could kill off the traditional Boxing Day sales. British retailers are expecting 151million visits to their websites, according to data firm Experian and online retailing trade association IMRG. They expect online traffic to be up by 26 per cent on the same day last year, with shoppers spending an average of £470,000 a minute. In comparison, the two companies predicted consumers would spend £556 million on Black Friday and £650 million on Cyber Monday. But consumers exceeded predictions, splurging on a shopping spree worth an estimated £810 million on Black Friday and £720 million on Cyber Monday. Experts identified Manic Monday last year as the key online shopping date ahead of Christmas as consumers left their shopping later because of increased confidence in delivery networks and click-and-collect services to get gifts to them before the holidays. Huge: In order to cope with all the orders the Swansea warehouse occupies 800,000 square feet and is the size of 11 football pitches . Well stocked: The shelves need to be dozens of feet high and thousands of workers are needed to keep it running over Christmas . Sea change: Cyber Monday has traditionally been the most popular day to order presents but the increase in same day delivery and click and collect services mean that people have waited another week before buying because they know they will get it in time for Christmas Day . Piles of clothing packed neatly in boxes can be seen for as far as the eye can see ready to be shipped out ahead of Manic Monday . In detail: Experts believe sales for Christmas gifts will rocket on several key days, peaking on Manic Monday, December 8 . It is also thought to be fuelled by the widespread use of mobile technology, while the Centre for Retail Research has suggested that the spending can be attributed to shoppers buying early out of fear that the items they want will sell out. Number of online shoppers: Six million . Average spend:  Around £110 each . Age bracket: Majority are between 25 and 34 . Peak times: 7am, Midday and 9pm . Total spend: £676million - £470,000 per min . Retailer website hits: 151million - up 26% . Christmas spending: £4.7billion this year . The heavy discounting offered by retailers on Black Friday and Cyber Monday is not expected to be a feature of Manic Monday, but many more websites than usual are offering free delivery and are pushing the message that goods will be delivered in time for Christmas. Experian Marketing Services senior retail consultant James Miller said: 'Christmas 2014 is on track to be another record breaking year for online retail in the UK. 'Continuing a trend we identified last year, Cyber Monday will no longer be the busiest pre-Christmas online shopping day, with Manic Monday expected to take the lead. 'With increased confidence in the standard of delivery services and click and collect, we expect to see people break away from traditional shopping habits.' Professor Josh Bamfield, director of the Centre for Retail Research, said: 'Manic Monday will be a significant day but I don't expect to see the scale of price cutting that was evident on Black Friday. 'There will still be the discounts but most of the sales will be down to shoppers worried that certain items could be out of stock, as well as making sure they are delivered in time for Christmas.' Starting again: Customers pushed each other out of the way as the crowd surges towards widescreen televisions at the Asda store in Wembley on Black Friday, but Cyber Monday could be even bigger . A Waitrose spokesman told MailOnline that the Heston from Waitrose Ultimate Chocolate Bar has been one of its best pre-Christmas sellers so far. Sales are up 56 per cent week-on-week, and the retail giant said it has had to double its orders for the £9.99 product to keep up with rising demand. In addition, sales last week from Waitrose Cellar – its online wine site - were up 40 per cent on last year as customers stocked up on alcohol.","UK consumers are expected to spend £676million in 24 hours on what is probably busiest online shopping day .

"'Lost it': Stefan Martens attacked his father with a hammer and saw after going berserk at the house they shared in Lancashire . A depressed son battered his 97-year-old former Spitfire pilot father with a hammer then hacked at his throat with a saw after snapping under the pressure of caring for him. Stefan Martens, 58, who had recently lost his job as a council binman and twice attempted to kill himself - went berserk after breakfast before calling police to say: 'I think I've just killed my father'. Despite suffering a cardiac arrest and multiple injuries including a 4cm gash on his neck - Janek Martens survived and later told a court: 'I don't think Stefan should be punished - what happened was a pure accident.' Preston Crown Court heard how Martens - described as a 'gentle giant' - had proudly devoted 20 years of his life to looking after his father having moved in following the death of his mother. But the burden had begun to take its toll on him and he was also suffering from severe depression. The pair had just eaten breakfast together on March 30 last year when Martens attacked his father with the hammer and the saw at the seaside semi-detached house they shared in St Annes, near Blackpool, Lancashire. During the 8am assault Mr Martens snr was struck around six times with the hammer before his son cut his throat with the saw. Police were called to the horrific scene after Martens ceased his attack and rang 999 announcing: 'I think I have just killed my father. 'I just lost it this morning and attacked him. He's a bit of a mess - I think he's dead.' Paramedics found the Mr Martens snr lying on the dining room floor, with blood all over his face, head and arms. He had a 4cm gash on his neck, an arm injury and also had a fracture to the cartilage of his voice box. The pensioner was airlifted to hospital in a critical condition but despite suffering a cardiac arrest and having to be revived several times, he made a recovery and is now in a care home. Mr Martens snr said later: 'I don't think Stefan should be punished at all. What happened was a pure accident. I love Stefan and I always will. I don't want him to go to prison.' At Preston Crown Court, Martens denied attempted murder but was convicted after a trial and jailed for 14 years. Family, friends and neighbours said there was a 'close bond' between the pair but in the past few years Mr Martens snr had become very dependent on him. The level of care Martens was having to provide to his father, who flew a Spitfire in Second World War, got on top of him and he had no other interests or hobbies. For 32 years Martens worked as a refuse collector for Fylde Council but was medically discharged after suffering back problems. Martens was jailed for 14 years for attempted murder . His own health began to deteriorate and he was diagnosed with depression. He underwent a course of cognitive behavioural therapy but ended up harbouring suicidal thoughts and tried to kill himself with an overdose before later making another attempt on his own life. Martens told the hearing: 'My intention was to cause him some harm. I'm not proud to say it. I have not come up with a proper conclusion why I did it. 'I don't think I ever will. If only I could turn the clock back to that day.' He added: 'It felt like it wasn't me who was doing it. I have never done a thing like that in my life and never will again. 'I remember him saying ""stop it, I'm your father, I'm your father"". 'I thought what am I doing? And I phoned the police. I felt like I had done him some serious damage, some serious harm. But it was never my intention to kill my own father.' Mr Martens snr declined to make a statement to police and did not support the prosecution, telling officers he could remember 'nothing' of the incident. He even gave a testimonial which summed up his son as 'an honest straight forward chap who tells the truth'. Martens has been at Guild Lodge mental health hospital since his arrest and will continue undergoing treatment in a psychiatric unit in Preston (above) In his 999 call Martens said: 'Mental health team were round a couple of days ago. I have been feeling suicidal'. He also said he had been feeling 'homicidal'. Mr Francis McEntee prosecuting told the court on the night before the attack, Martens had been seen making his way home at about 7pm and seemed a bit unsteady on his feet. The following morning, a neighbour heard a dull thudding noise from the address, at about 8am. There were a number of repeated thuds which went on for around five seconds. Mr McIntee said: 'The prosecution case quite plainly is the defendant tried to kill his father and we say he clearly believed he had done so. He accepted causing his injuries and that he intended to cause him really serious harm. Martens, who has been at Guild Lodge mental health hospital since his arrest, will continue undergoing treatment in a psychiatric unit under the Mental Health Act as part of his sentence. Today Detective Sergeant Nick Denman, of Lancashire Police said: 'This was a tragic case where an elderly man has been subjected to a savage attack by his own son - to try to comprehend and come to terms with that must be extremely difficult for both Janek and the wider family. 'Hopefully the conclusion of this sad case will at least offer the opportunity to the Martens family to try to move on with their lives.'

"An online fundraiser for the family of a Pennsylvania woman allegedly killed by her stepfather last month has nearly reached its $15,000 goal, as prosecutors have revealed the shocking murder was motivated by the suspect's necrophilia. Gregory Graf, 53, was arrested late last month and charged with shooting dead his newlywed stepdaughter, 33-year-old Jessica Padgett, who was last seen alive November 21. Her body was discovered buried behind a shed on Graf's property five days later. A friend in need: Shauna Wilkins, pictured right next to Jessica Padgett, has launched a fundraising campaign to help her slain friend's family in the aftermath of her murder . Kindness of strangers: As of Monday morning, the GoFundMe campaign was just $380 shy of its $15,000 goal . On Friday, it emerged that the suspected gunman videotaped himself sexually abusing the lifeless body of the 33-year-old mother of three. Shauna Wilkins, a longtime friend of the victim's, launched a GoFundMe campaign a week and a half ago to provide financial assistance to Padgett's three young children, reported Leigh Valley Morning Call. As of Monday morning, the fundraiser was just $380 short of its $15,000 goal thanks to the generosity of nearly 340 Good Samaritans. Padgett's widower, Mica, and his mother are the only people who will be able to use the collected donations, which will help cover the grieving family’s basic living expenses. Padgett's sister, Kristi Davis, wrote a message on her Facebook page last week thanking the community for their generosity and kindness. 'I don't want my brother in law to have to worry an ounce about the mortgage or putting food on the table until he can heal and get back to work. Thank you again!' she wrote November 30. Miss Davis took to the fundraising page last week to once again express her gratitude for the outpouring of support. 'Wow.. I'm just speechless. You all are amazing and Jessica is smiling down on all of you for helping to take care of her precious babies,' Padgett's sister posted. Alleged necrophiliac: Gregory Graf recorded himself sexually abusing the body of Jessica Padgett, Northampton County District Attorney John Morganelli said on Friday . Discovered: Graf was arrested five days later after police found Padgett's buried behind a shed on the property where he lives with Padgett's mother . Hunter: Gregory Graf's Facebook is filled with photos of him along with animals he's hunted . On Friday, Northampton County District Attorney John Morganelli said investigators have discovered a video on Gregory Graf's computer showing the 53-year-old sexually abusing Jessica Padgett's corpse. Padgett, 33, was last seen alive November 21, when she left work at a day care center. Graf was arrested five days later after police found her body outside the home where he lives with Padgett's mother. Graf, 53, is being held without bail on a homicide charge. The fencing company owner confessed to killing Padgett, a recently married mother of three, according to Morganelli. The victim's family said in a statement last month that Padgett 'was a beautiful, vibrant young woman who was beloved by her family and friends. The world shines less bright today.' Graf applied for a public defender, saying in court Friday that he didn't want to burden his family financially. A judge turned him down, ruling he had enough money to pay for his own defense. 'Like I said, I just don't want to take away the funds from the family,' said Graf, the owner of a fencing company. 'You're not going to be able to escape paying for the resources of an attorney,' Judge Stephen Baratta told Graf . 'I just can't allow that.' Morganelli said Graf will be charged with abuse of a corpse. So happy together: The raised funds will be made available to Jessica's (far right) newlywed husband, Mica (top left). Pictured here are the happy couple with their friends, Shauna and Jim Wilkins . Two peas in a pod: Ms Wilkins (right), a longtime friend of Jessica's (left), launched the fundraiser to help the woman's grieving husband and children with basic living expenses . Killed: Padgett,  a 33-year-old mother of three, was last seen alive on November 21, when she left work at a day care center and her dead body was found in a shed five days later . 'He videotaped it,' Morganelli told Philly.com. 'So there's a videotape of him abusing the corpse sexually.' Morganelli said he believes that Graf took his stepdaughter's life in order to abuse her as a corpse. 'I believe it was a direct motive, in my opinion,' Morganelli said, 'and that's what we're going to be arguing.' Because the alleged abuse occurred after Padgett was killed Morganelli will not be able to seek the death penalty. Philly.com reports that under Pennsylvania law Rape and murder allow prosecutors to purse capital charges but sexual desecration of a corpse does not. Padgett went missing that day after she left Duck Duck Goose Child Care in Northampton and she never returned to her job there. Police say that the shooting happened around 10 minutes after she was last seen, though her body wasn't recovered until five days later. Morganelli has said Graf also had a marijuana-growing space at his house that was discovered by police as they searched for Padgett. Police seized 13 bags of marijuana and also confiscated $42,000 in cash and envelopes containing marijuana seeds from in a safe in the basement of Graf's home. \ . Graf's Facebook account indicates he has a love of hunting animals and has killed quite a few. Loved:  The victim's family said in a statement last month that Padgett 'was a beautiful, vibrant young woman who was beloved by her family and friends.

"These are the pictures shown to a jury of a British student accused of joining rebel forces in Syria - posing for photos with machine guns and a tank in the war-torn country. David Souaan, a student at Birkbeck College, London told a court he only held the weapons because he 'wanted to look cool' and that the photographs were just to keep as 'trophies'. He allegedly visited Syria to fight last year and was planning to return there when he was stopped and arrested at Heathrow Airport in May. Photographs of David Souaan (pictured) brandishing weapons have been shown to jurors at the Old Bailey . In one picture presented to the court, Souaan was shown on top of a tank and holding a machine gun . A mass of pictures, videos and documents found on his phone and computer showed Souaan's 'extremist sympathies', the prosecution claimed, but he says he never had a weapon himself. The 20-year-old insisted he only went there for two nights in December last year to help retrieve his 82-year-old grandfather's belongings after he fled with just the clothes on his back. Pictures of the student with a range of guns were just to keep as 'trophies', jurors at the Old Bailey were told. Souaan said his grandfather's house had been destroyed in the war and he had been forced to flee to Urfa, in Turkey. David Souaan, who allegedly joined rebel forces in Syria, said he only posed for pictures with guns to look 'cool' It was during a visit to Turkey that the elderly man persuaded Souaan's father to collect his property from his home town of Deir ez-Zor, in Syria. The defendant said: 'My father told me that he is going to travel so I told him, ""let me come with you"" because in a sense although there was a guarantee from my father it would be safe, I was still worried about my father. I still wanted to go to give him support.' Asked if he also wanted to go for himself, he replied: 'In a sense, yes. I did want to go for myself, just to see how the town looks like.' Souaan was quizzed about a series of pictures of him posing with a variety of different guns during the trip. He said: 'I thought it was interesting and I wanted to show it to my brother as well. 'There is no specific reason but for me, at the time, it seemed interesting. It was something new.' His lawyer Ali Bajwa QC asked: 'Why so many of you posing with weapons or firearms?' Souaan replied: 'Because at the time when I was there I felt something like I wanted some trophy - the photos. 'As the teenagers say nowadays, it looks ""cool"". So that was the reason.' He insisted that while he was in the Free Syrian Army-held town he never had a weapon himself and nor did his father or any of the people responsible for keeping them safe. The Birkbeck College student told the court how his father was Syrian Muslim and his mother was Serbian Christian. He described to jurors how his family had become wealthy after his father set up a successful construction business in Serbia but maintained strong family ties to Syria. David Souaan told a court he only held the weapons because he 'wanted to look cool' and that the photographs were just to keep as 'trophies' A mass of pictures, videos and documents found on his phone and computer showed Souaan's 'extremist sympathies', the prosecution claimed, but he says he never had a weapon himself . Souaan studied at an international school in Serbia because he wanted to go to university abroad. He was given a three-year student visa and began studying global politics and international relations at Birkbeck College in London, living in halls of residence. But after he arrived in London for his first term of university on October 6 last year he said he was 'lonely' and did not make many new friends. The court heard how the devout Muslim exchanged loving texts with his Christian Serbian girlfriend who had gone to Miami to study. Souaan, a student at Birkbeck College (pictured), London, told the Old Bailey that he never had a weapon himself . She called him by his pet name 'little panda' and he told her he loved his 'little sweetie' 'more than anything in the world'. Asked to describe his first term, Souaan said: 'I would describe my feelings as mixed. I was looking forward to coming to London, attending university, it was a new experience. 'I would say it was fine but I was feeling a little bit lonely.' Souaan denies a charge of preparing for terrorist acts in Syria.

"Romanian bank robber Constantin Alexandroaia was jailed for 13-and-a-half years for blowing up three cash machines in the Midlands, escaping with £27,000 . A Romanian bank robber who forced explosive gas into cash machines to blow them up and steal thousands of pounds has been jailed. Constantin Alexandroaia stole £27,000 in three raids on cash machines in the Midlands, claiming he had no choice but to turn to crime after going broke and having to sell his family dog. The father-of-one, who rigged up explosions by attaching pipes to Barclays ATMs and forcing gas from cylinders into them, admitted the 'well planned and well executed' attacks. Alexandroaia, a scrap dealer from Sparkhill, Birmingham, caused £73,000 damage to cash machines across the Midlands during the raids which took place during a 25-day period this year. The married 33-year-old pleaded guilty to three counts of causing explosions and three counts of burglary on the first day of his trial at Birmingham Crown Court. During sentencing, Alexandroaia told the court he decided to blow up two cashpoints in Birmingham and another in Leicester because he was broke and had been forced to sell his dog. The court was told that the 'well planned and well executed' ATM attacks in March and April were the first of their type in the UK. Alexandroaia and an unknown accomplice were thwarted in the Birmingham attacks, in Druids Heath and Castle Bromwich, after security glass stopped them from reaching the money which had been blown out the back of the machines. The judge said it was pure luck that none of the people living in the flat above the Alcester Road South Barclays in Druids Heath were injured by the explosion on March 21. Alexandroaia and an unknown accomplice stole £27,000 and caused £73,000 worth of damage in their raids across the Midlands. Pictured: Damaged cash machine after a raid by the pair in Druids Heath, Birmingham . The father-of-one rigged up explosions by attaching pipes to Barclays ATMs and forcing gas from cylinders into them, causing cash to explode out the back of the machines . The masked pair unsuccessfully struck again days later at the Chester Road branch in Castle Bromwich, on April 1. But they did escape with £27,000 from the Sibson Road branch in Birstall, Leicester, on April 15, cash which has never been recovered. All three attacks took place at around 4am. The court was shown CCTV of Alexandroaia rigging up the cylinders and smashing into the buildings. The roof could also be seen falling in during the Druids Heath raid and a chair was thrown across the branch in Leicester. Alexandroaia was arrested as he tried to board a plane to his native Romania at Luton Airport on April 24. He was caught after his blood was found in an abandoned and previously stolen BMW getaway car after the Castle Bromwich raid. The court heard that he had served time in jail for theft and dishonesty in Romania and Italy. He was also handed a conditional discharge in August 2013 for attacking a hospital car park cash machine with a sledgehammer. The married 33-year-old pleaded guilty to three counts of causing explosions and three counts of burglary . One of the cash machines blown up by Constantin Alexandroaia, 33, in March and April this year . Justin Hugheston-Roberts, defending, said: 'The defence accepts entirely his involvement. 'He was to be evicted and had to sell the family dog. 'He could not cope here in this country, which is why he undertook the request from others to become involved in organised crime.' In a letter, read out on his behalf, he said: 'I agreed to participate because I needed the money for my family. I am sorry and very ashamed for what I did.'

"A gang of Gambian diplomats face jail after they avoided £5million in tax by turning their London embassy into a tobacconist. Seven staff members 'systematically abused' diplomatic tax exemptions to order 29 tonnes of rolling tobacco in just three years - more than half a million pouches. They were caught after the Foreign and Commonwealth Office was alerted to the system being abused and told tax inspectors, who found more than 60 enormous order forms. Tax cheats: Deputy head of the Gambian Diplomatic Mission Yusapha Bojang (left) and first secretary Gaston Sambou (right) sold millions of tonnes of rolling tobacco from their £6m redbrick embassy in west London . They decided the vast amounts could not possibly be for personal use and launched a criminal probe which led the Gambian government to waive the workers' diplomatic immunity. All seven were at the Gambian Diplomatic Mission in Kensington, west London, and included its deputy head Yusapha Bojang, 54, and first secretary Gaston Sambou, 48. They denied conspiracy to cheat the public revenue but were found guilty after a trial at Southwark Crown Court lasting more than a month. The jury heard they ordered so much tobacco that the firms which supplied them, International Diplomatic Supplies Limited and Chacalli De Decker, often could not bring enough. Driver Christopher Pelc, who gave evidence for the prosecution, said he was hired to deliver boxes crammed full of Golden Virginia and Old Holborn pouches from a warehouse in Tilbury, Essex. Once he arrived at the Mission, a £6million redbrick townhouse in one of London's most expensive streets, he gave the orders to front desk secretary Audrey Leeward, 48, who signed for them. They would then be put in a 'back room', the trial heard - and it was a regular occurrence, since he saw Leeward so often that she had a pet name for him. Diplomats in Britain are allowed to order alcohol, perfume and tobacco without having to pay VAT or excise duty because of their status. Vast: Boxes crammed full of Golden Virginia and Old Holborn were picked up from a warehouse in Essex . Plush: Their workplace (centre left with the Gambian flag) was in one of London's most expensive streets . Diplomatic immunity has existed for more than 50 years and is agreed on by almost every country in the world, even those with frosty international relations such as North Korea. It was signed into law under the 1961 Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations to ensure diplomats can represent their nation without being harassed by their hosts. This is particularly essential in countries which criminalise behaviour which would be perfectly acceptable at home, and those which prosecute people for political reasons. But there have been abuses of the system - including the fact that diplomats do not have to pay parking fines. More than £60million of London's congestion charge fines have been avoided by embassies, Foreign Secretary William Hague revealed last year, including £7million by U.S. diplomats alone. It is extremely rare for immunity to be waived, and it can only happen with the agreement of the diplomat's home country. Some nations refuse on principle, while most reserve the measure only for serious crimes. In 2002 Colombia waived diplomatic immunity on a London-based official who was accused of killing a mugger. He was later found not guilty of manslaughter and murder. They are only permitted to buy the products for personal use by themselves or other colleagues within their embassies. But the Gambian diplomats took advantage of a loophole in which there was a quota on the number of cigarettes they could order, but not the amount of hand rolling tobacco. That meant they were allowed to sign off more than 60 diplomatic order forms between 2009 and 2012 before the alarm was raised. They broke the law by selling the goods from their Kensington headquarters - making them once again eligible to pay around £4.8million in tax. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office had to ask permission from the Gambian government for the men to be prosecuted. Normally diplomats would be exempt from prosecution, but it was decided that the normal privileges would be waived. The court heard Bojang and Sambou both abused their diplomatic privileges along with welfare officer Georgina Gomez, 29, and finance attaché Ebrima John, 38. The other guilty workers - Leeward, 54-year-old driver Veerahia Ramarajaha and 60-year-old secretary Hasaintu Noah - did not have diplomatic privileges, but aided the tax fraud. Driver Ramarajaha was also convicted of dealing, harbouring, concealing or carrying dutiable goods. Eighth defendant Ida Jeng Njie, who worked in the same building for the Gambian Tourist Authority, was found not guilty of conspiracy to cheat the revenue. Lisa Rose, a fraud specialist for the Crown Prosecution Service, said: 'The deception undertaken by these defendants involved a serious breach of the trust of their own government and of the British people. Lengthy: The trial of the seven tax fraudsters at Southwark Crown Court lasted more than a month . 'The scheme they designed and implemented not only resulted in the public purse being cheated of almost £4.8m in tax revenue, but it also abused their diplomatic status, taking advantage of the entire system of diplomatic privilege which is reliant on trust and responsibility. 'For all practical purposes, the scheme in operation was like running a business and the volume of tobacco was so large that to suggest it was for personal use, or for the use of the High Commission, is implausible.' Ms Rose thanked the government of The Gambia for waiving diplomatic immunity. She added: 'The public should have confidence that in cases where our tax systems have been exploited, all steps will be taken to ensure that diplomatic staff cannot commit offences and then hide behind diplomatic immunity.' The Diplomatic Mission is now officially known as the Gambian Embassy after the West African nation left the Commonwealth last year. The case forced British authorities to extend their quota system to cover hand rolling tobacco just six months after they discovered the fraud in 2012. The seven guilty workers will be sentenced on Wednesday.","Seven senior figures ordered 29 tonnes of rolling tobacco in three years .

"Boris John today mocked Nigel Farage's claim that he was late for an event because of immigrants on the road, branding the Ukip leader's views 'sewage'. The London Mayor accused Mr Farage of 'freaking out' after complaining that the UK's 'open door immigration' policy meant that the M4 'is not as navigable as it used to be'. Mr Johnson said such examples of xenophobia is like 'effluent... something that human beings naturally produce' but must be disposed of. Scroll down for video . London Mayor Boris Johnson accused Mr Farage of 'freaking out' after complaining that the UK's 'open door immigration' policy meant that the M4 'is not as navigable as it used to be' Mr Farage has been mocked for his elaborate excuse for missing an event charging Ukip supporters £25 each to meet him on Friday night. He blamed immigration for there being too many cars on the roads to make the 180-mile journey from London to Port Talbot in south Wales. He told BBC Sunday Politics Wales: 'It took me six hours and 15 minutes in the car to get here. It should have taken three-and-half to four. 'That has nothing to do with professionalism. What is does have to do with is a country in which the population is going through the roof, chiefly because of open door immigration and the fact the M4 is not as navigable as it used to be. 'In all these years in Ukip that's probably about the third event out of a thousand that I haven't made in time.' Labour last night branded the comments 'silly' and 'dangerous'. Today Mr Johnson said: 'Of all the excuses I’ve heard for being late, that is one of the poorest.' He told LBC radio: “Xenophobia is like sewage, it’s a natural concomitant of the human condition. We’ve got to manage it, we’ve got to dispose of it. 'It’s like effluent, it’s something that human beings naturally produce. It doesn’t mean human beings are bad. “It’s part of the way human beings are. I think there’s a natural sort of tendency to be alarmed about the Other, the alien.' He stressed that London has benefited 'massively' from immigration but he insisted: . 'They need to speak English, they need to be loyal to this culture, to this country, to our institutions, to our society, to the Queen, to the rule of law – all the things that make us British – a sense of humour, and not freaking out about traffic jams on the motorway.' Ukip held its first ever Welsh National Conference at the weekend, with Mr Farage delivering a speech to activists on Saturday. But he had been due to mingle with paying guests at a reception on Friday night. Around 100 Ukip members paid £25 each for tickets for the event at the Orangery in Margam Country Park, Port Talbot. Mr Farage complained that the M4, linking London to south Wales, was the 'not as navigable as it used to be' But the leader failed to turn up, later pointing the finger at the number of immigrants using the roads. Owen Smith, Labour's shadow Welsh secretary, said: 'Remarks like these are what makes Farage so dangerous. 'It is clearly absurd to suggest heavy traffic on the M4 is caused by immigration, but through the laughter at his silly comments you can hear Ukip's dog-whistle politics of division.' Last week it emerged that Ukip pays £60,000-a-year for Mr Farage to enjoy the services of a chauffeur. Mr Farage told LBC on Friday: 'You look at all the other leaders of political parties, they of course, all have the state provide them with, you know, the means to get around, and with security. The state doesn't provide Ukip with anything.' He said he had written to the government asking for state help with his security bills, but it had been refused. He suggesed he should be given the same level of protection as 'any former Northern Ireland Secretary'. 'I'm not having an argument over it, the fact is we don't get help. Do I need (a) security? Yes. And do I need to be driven around from place to place? I think I probably do. 'I mean, I came up here early this morning, I'm off to Swansea in a minute to give a speech. I think I do actually need...so there is a team, there are two guys who are with me and take me round the place. 'And if that's being interpreted by one national newspaper as somehow I'm now living high on the hog, in this luxury 4 x 4 car, all I would say to the newspaper that writes stuff like that is, come and spend a week with me, you'll be half dead by the end of it.'","London Mayor accuses Ukip leader of 'freaking out' about congestion .

"A public transit system that still uses metal tokens and paper transfers - yes, in the 21st century - appears finally to be moving into the era of debit cards and pay-by-cellphone technology. Philadelphia riders can now see evidence of SEPTA Key, the long-awaited smart card system for the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority. Dozens of computerized kiosks, turnstiles and fare boxes have popped up in stations and on vehicles, and testing begins this month. Scroll down for video . All change: After years of promises, passengers in Philadelphia can see evidence of a new smart card system . 'We see this project as taking us in the fare payment industry from last place to first place,' said Kevin O'Brien, SEPTA senior program manager. What exactly does 'last place' mean? Let's start with Philadelphia being one of the few cities in North America to still use tokens for buses, subways and trolleys. Chicago stopped selling them in 1999, followed by New York in 2003 and Boston in 2006. (Though Toronto continues to use them.) However, SEPTA doesn't have token machines at every station, and cashiers aren't always on duty. When they are, they don't necessarily sell tokens; sometimes, they just accept exact change for the $2.25 cash fare - which, by the way, is higher than the $1.80 token cost. Oh, and token machines don't take credit cards. This is how the nation's sixth-largest transportation system operates? Incredibly, the answer is yes. Frustrating: SEPTA doesn't have token machines at every station, and cashiers aren't always on duty . Overhaul: Howeveer, the public transport authority says SEPTA Key, when fully implemented, will be the most comprehensive and seamless fare system in the U.S., offering multiple payment options . Which leaves a lot of ground to cover to reach 'first place.' But officials say that SEPTA Key, when fully implemented, will be the most comprehensive and seamless fare system in the U.S., offering multiple payment options and integration with commuter trains. Every subway station will have kiosks that accept credit and debit cards. Riders with microchipped bank cards or a cellphone app can pay right at the turnstile or bus fare box. And forget about those paper bus transfers - Key cards recognize connected trips and deduct accordingly. SEPTA has been promising the changes at least as far back as 2007 but didn't award the $130 million contract until 2011. The program was delayed by funding problems such as reductions in state aid and other mandated safety spending, agency spokeswoman Jerri Williams said. SEPTA officials are coy about when customers will finally get Keys to the system; they say only that it should roll out in 2015 and be completed the following year. That's comparable to the five years it took Boston to fully deploy its CharlieCard system. The Key card can't come soon enough for Catherine Anderson. The subway station closest to her west Philadelphia home doesn't have a token machine, and the cashier booth isn't staffed during off-peak hours. 'I just find that really frustrating,' said Anderson, 31. 'I don't know why there aren't token machines everywhere.' SEPTA does sell weekly and monthly passes that commuters can swipe in turnstiles and fare boxes. But they can't be renewed; riders have to wait in line to purchase new ones from an attendant at the start of each week or month. With the new system, those passes will be available - and renewable - at any kiosk, anytime. Final farewell: Metal tokens are still used by 22per cent of riders, according to SEPTA officials . Timeline: SEPTA officials are coy about when customers will finally get Keys to the system; they say only that it should roll out in 2015 and be completed the following year . Ravi Bayanker, who recently moved to Philadelphia, still can't believe his credit cards are useless in the current arcane system. He recently paid $5 to ride the subway because he had no tokens and the booth attendant wouldn't make change. 'What business in America doesn't give change to its customers?' he said. Williams acknowledged the custom is cumbersome for riders, but she said it's efficient for SEPTA. Bayanker longs for the MetroCards he previously used in New York, which he could load with money and use it at his leisure. 'I just want a SEPTA pass with $100 on it,' he said. That will happen eventually, and Bayanker will even be able to add value to the card online. For now, he's better off stocking up on tokens, which are still used by 22per cent of riders, according to SEPTA officials. The agency hasn't yet announced a phase-out date for tokens. As troublesome as they can be, Anderson has a soft spot in her heart for the metal coins. She and her boyfriend even dressed up as a token and token machine for Halloween - whimsical costumes that brought a lot of attention on the street and on social media. 'We thought, ""We have to do it this year because next year the tokens may be gone,""' Anderson said.","Computerized kiosks, turnstiles and fare boxes have popped up in stations and on vehicles in Philadelphia .
The new ticket machines are being tested this month .
Philadelphia is currently one of the few cities in North America to still use metal tokens for buses, subways and trolleys .

"Shadow foreign secretary Douglas Alexander said business leaders have a 'patriotic duty' make the case for Brussels . Labour today urged supporters of the European Union to speak out before it is 'too late'. Shadow foreign secretary Douglas Alexander said business leaders have a 'patriotic duty' make the case for Brussels. And he warned that the Conservative Party's approach to Europe poses 'the biggest risk to British national prosperity in a generation'. David Cameron has promised that if he remains prime minister after the election he will renegotiate Britain's EU membership before holding an in-out referendum by 2017. He has made clear that without agreement on curbing benefits, he will 'rule nothing out' – raising the prospect of backing Britain's exit from the EU if he does not get his way. Today Labour warned business leaders they must start making the arguments against severing ties with Brussels. In a speech to ambassadors from all 28 EU member states, Mr Alexander said pro-EU business leaders should learn the lessons of the Scottish independence debate. Many companies delayed expressing a view until the last minute when polls suggest a Yes vote could win, but were then seen as playing a crucial role in shaping the final days of the campaign. Mr Alexander acknowledged that many business leaders are wary of getting involved in political debates. But he added: 'For business to speak up for Britain's place in Europe is not about party political advantage, it is about recognising both where our country's national interest and your business interests lies. 'It is about patriotic duty. And good business sense.' Leaving the EU would mean 'actively choosing an economy with weaker investment, less trade with the rest of the world, poorer productivity and worse living standards,' said Mr Alexander. He claimed Mr Cameron had become 'a much more marginal figure in Brussels', adding: 'Ukip is on the march, and David Cameron is running.' Last month the Prime Minister used his long-awaited immigration speech to insist that curbs on tax credits, child benefits, jobseekers allowance and council housing will be a key demand for his talks on renegotiating Britain's EU membership. Issuing a direct appeal for other European countries who have seen thousands of their citizens move to the UK to support limiting movement across the continent, he insisted his demands were not 'outlandish' and Britain deserves 'to be heard'. And he threatened to block any new countries joining the EU unless controls are imposed to stop their citizens flocking to more successful economies like Britain. But Mr Alexander warned that a Conservative victory in the 2015 election would mean that within the course of the next Parliament, Britain could be out of Europe and thrust into a 'full-blown constitutional crisis'. 'The truth is that a Conservative government in 2015 would mean breaking not simply with the record of the last government, it would mean breaking with decades of history that have defined the country we are today, how our country is run, and the place we have in the world,' he said. 'That risk is real. And so too is the responsibility on business to now find its voice and to make the case with authority and passion, that the right road for Britain is not exit from Europe but reform within Europe.' David Cameron, pictured with pupils James Samur (centre) and George Bateman during a physics class at the Harris City Academy, has promised to renegotiate Britain's membership of the EU . The Prime Minister has made clear that without agreement on curbing benefits, he will 'rule nothing out' – raising the prospect of backing Britain's exit from the EU if he does not get his way . In a message to the 'quiet majority' of UK business leaders who he said were concerned about EU exit, he added: 'Now is the time to speak out. Now is the time to speak up. Because you know what is most at stake. You know what we have to lose. Your voice must be heard, because if you wait, it could be too late.' Mr Alexander said that Labour would push for reform of the EU, rather than exit, arguing for the creation of a Council of the Single Market to defend the interests of non-eurozone members and for changes to competition rules to allow national governments to support firms at times of crisis. Terry Scuoler, chief executive of manufacturers' organisation EEF, said: 'Manufacturers remain overwhelmingly of the view that our economic well-being and long term strategic interest of this country is dependent on being a full and leading player in the EU. Equally we do recognise that reform of the EU is also a key requirement. 'We do not want uncertainty on this subject. Jobs, investment and trade are all dependent on a thriving and effective EU, with Britain at its heart. That's what we all need to be striving to achieve.' Alisdair McIntosh, director of pro-reform pressure group Business for New Europe, said: 'The debate about our EU membership is about the national interest. Investment, growth and jobs are at stake. 'EU membership is particularly important to vital industries including aerospace, the automotive sector, engineering and pharmaceuticals. It also plays a crucial role in facilitating research and development. These areas are critical for jobs and competitiveness. Politicians and business leaders alike need to reflect this.'","Shadow foreign secretary Douglas Alexander urges business to speak out .

"Sixteen and 17-year-olds will be allowed to vote within a year of the next election, Labour leader Ed Miliband pledged last night. Mr Miliband said the government would change the law to lower the voting age from May 2016. Such a move – the first change in the national voting age since 1969 – would enfranchise more than 1.5million 16 and 17-year-olds. It comes after the voting age was lowered for the first time in the Scottish referendum in September. Scroll down for video . Giving teenagers the vote was tested during the Scottish independence referendum in September . During a YouTube debate, organised by the 'Bite The Ballot' youth democracy movement, Mr Miliband said: ‘Too many young people are turning their backs on politics which is bad for our country and bad for them too. ‘That’s because too often young people don’t get a look-in with politicians who know they can’t vote - or assume that they won’t vote. ‘The measures we will introduce in our first year of government represent the greatest extension of the franchise in my lifetime. ‘But it is not enough just to give young people the right to vote. We must do everything we can to ensure they have the chance to exercise it.' Mr Miliband, who has long been a supporter of an earlier voting age, is expected to use a speech at next week’s party conference to pledge that the policy will be included in his general election manifesto. Party sources believe that idealistic youngsters are more likely to vote Labour. The idea is also backed by the Liberal Democrats. The voting age in Britain was reduced from 21 to 18 in 1969. Conservative Party chairman Grant Shapps has previously dismissed calls to lower the voting age to 16 when the issue was raised last year. Mr Shapps warned the move would ‘politicise the classroom, with votes for youngsters who are still at school’. He also accused Labour of bowing to the demands of its union paymasters over the issue. Last year Unite, which is Labour’s biggest donor, demanded that 16-year-olds should be given the vote. The union, run by Len McCluskey, said: ‘Young people should be given a stake in the political process by lowering the voting age to 16.’ An exit poll of just over 2,000 Scottish voters by Tory peer Lord Ashcroft showed that the 16 and 17-year-olds enfranchised for the first time by the Scottish referendum were overwhelmingly in favour of independence. The small sample – which may not have been representative of teenagers overall – showed that 71 per cent of the age group voted Yes. In contrast, only 27 per cent of over-65s voted in favour of independence in Lord Ashcroft’s sample. The figures suggest that school pupils are indeed more likely to vote for radical options placed in front of them. But this did not carry through to the next age group – the split between Yes and No for 18- to 24-year-olds was virtually even in the exit poll.","Miliband pledged to lower voting age to 16 in conference speech .

"One woman in a fading Japanese village is slowly replacing its dead residents with scarecrows. The 35 residents left in Nagoro, southern Japan, are now outnumbered three-two-one by the mannequins Tsukimi Ayano has made to replace neighbours who have died or moved away. It's an eccentric response to an increasingly common problem. More than 10,000 towns and villages in Japan are depopulated, homes and infrastructure crumbling as the countryside empties. 'They bring back memories': Tsukimi Ayano stitches a scarecrow girl by her outdoor hearth at her home in Nagoro, southern Japan, which is one of 10,000 radically depopulated as the country's population decreases . Scarecrow passengers wait at a bus stop: This village deep in the rugged mountains of southern Japan once was home to hundreds of families. Now, only 35 people remain, outnumbered three-to-one by scarecrows . A teenager scarecrow sits on a log pile: Nagoro is typical of the thousands of rural Japanese communities turning into ghost towns or at best, open-air museums, frozen in time . At 65, Ms Tsukimi is one of the younger residents of Nagoro, a small village nestled in the rugged mountain landscape of interior of the southern island of Shikoku. She moved back from Osaka to look after her 85-year-old father after decades away. 'They bring back memories,' Ms Tsukimi said of the life-size dolls crowded into corners of her farmhouse, perched on fences and trees, huddled side-by-side at a produce stall, the bus stop - anywhere a living person might stop. 'That old lady used to come and chat and drink tea. That old man used to love to drink sake and tell stories. It reminds me of the old times, when they were still alive and well,' she said. Returnee: Ms Tsukimi returned to Nagoro 13 years ago to look after her elderly father after decades away . Creepy: A mannequin watches Ms Tsukimi as she stitches together a new 'resident' Model students: A scarecrow teacher and pupils fill a classroom in Nagoro's now deserted elementary school . Nagoro is typical of the thousands of communities turning into ghost towns or at best, open-air museums, frozen in time - a trend evident even in downtown Tokyo and in nearly or completely empty villages in the city's suburbs. The one-street town is mostly abandoned, its shops and homes permanently shuttered. With no youngsters left to raise, the local elementary school closed two years ago. Now Ms Tsukimi sometimes guides visitors through the spotless classrooms populated with scarecrow students and teachers. As Japan grew increasingly affluent after the Second World War, younger Japanese abandoned the countryside, flooding into the cities for jobs in factories and service industries, leaving their elders to tend small farms. Greater Tokyo, with more than 37million people, and Osaka-Kobe, with 11.5million, account for nearly 40 per cent of the country's 127million people, with another 10million scattered in a handful of provincial capitals. 'There's been this huge sucking sound as the countryside is emptied,' said Joel Cohen, a professor at Columbia University's Laboratory of Populations. Meanwhile, a falling birthrate means there are too few people to repopulate rural areas as the rapidly ageing population left tending the fields die off. Japan's population began to decline in 2010 from a peak of 128 million. Without a drastic increase in the birthrate or a loosening of the staunch Japanese resistance to immigration, it is forecast to fall to about 108 million by 2050 and to 87 million by 2060. By then, four in 10 Japanese will be over 65 years old. With no feet to fell them: A pair of slippers sits ready to be worn outside an abandoned home in Kawamata, a town close to Nagoro that is also all but deserted . Gathering dust: An electric rice cooker is seen through a window of an abandoned home in Kawamata . When Ms Tsukimi returned to her hometown 13 years ago, she initially tried farming. Thinking her radish seeds may have been eaten by crows, she decided to make some scarecrows. Now there are more 100 scattered around Nagoro and other towns in Shikoku. Like handcarved Buddhist sculptures, each has its own whimsical expression. Some sleep, their eyelids permanently shut. Others cuddle toddler scarecrows, or man ploughs and hoes. Ms Tsukimi brings one along for company on her 90-minute drive to buy groceries in the nearest big town. But most remain behind, to be photographed and marvelled at by tourists who detour through the winding mountain roads. 'If I hadn't made these scarecrows, people would just drive right by,' she said.","Tsukimi Ayano made the mannequins to replace neighbours in her town .

"A 63-year-old skier is recovering in hospital after spending three hours digging himself out of an avalanche in Alaska - only to discover his friend lying dead next to him. Michael Hopper was skiing with 35-year-old Eric Peterson in the Rainbow Mountains, near the Richardson Highway, when the pair were caught in a deadly avalanche, troopers said. After being buried in deep snow, Mr Hopper spent three hours digging himself out in freezing temperatures, before spotting Mr Peterson's glove lying on the ground. He then started digging into surrounding snow and found his friend's dead body, it is said.

"Conspiracy: Balwant Bains says he was forced out from his school because he wanted to instil British values in students . A Sikh headteacher who ran a school at the centre of an alleged 'Trojan Horse' plot said today he was forced out because he was 'giving children  British values'. Balwant Bains claims he had to leave Saltley School in Birmingham after suffering a campaign of 'emotional harassment' spearheaded by Muslim governors. Mr Bains, who was put on gardening leave and then decided to quit, opposed plans by Muslim governors to scrap sex education lessons and introduce only Halal meat, from animals killed in line with the Koran's teachings, for school meals. The headteacher, which helped his school get record GCSE results in 2013, says he was accused of Islamophobia and racism after he tried to discipline a Muslim pupil who threatened other students with a knife. Speaking for the first time about his treatment Mr Bains said: 'I suppose I was a threat, giving these children more British values, for them to be integrated into society. 'It made me value education more, and because it is free in this country. I lifted myself out of poverty because of education. If I could do it, if I could break the cycle, other children could, too.' He told the New York Times that if nothing changes after the Trojan Horse scandal 'then it means anyone can just go in and destroy a school and get away with it.' Mr Bains claims the chair of governors tried to undermine him after they fell out over the running of the school. He claims every day for three months he had to justify his decisions, including mundane queries about why students had to walk on the right hand side of corridors and not the left. He then put together a 300-page document explaining all other decisions, including his assembly messages and work on the school website. Problems heightened when he expelled a Muslim boy for threatening other children with a knife. But governors then reinstated the boy against the wishes of the head and Birmingham City Council. He then did not suspend a white student over a weapon, and then a campaign calling for protests against his management was launched, where he was called 'racist' and Islamophobic. Failing: Saltley School was placed in special measures after Ofsted found it was failing students, a year after pupils gained record GCSE results . A text, announcing a demonstration outside the school was sread around the local mosque and said: 'Racist headteacher! Racist white staff! He suspends Muslim pupils and doesn't suspend non-Muslims. He suspends not-guilty Muslim teachers and doesn't suspend guilty non-Muslim teachers. 'Are you going to let this racist Islamaphobic (sic) headteacher, Balwant Bains, get away with it? If you believe in justice and that everyone should be treated equally, join the demonstration.' A few weeks after the demonstration in October last year, Mr Bains, of Sikh origin, was sent on 'gardening leave'. Five non-Muslim governors at Saltley then resigned, leaving 12 of the 14 governors Muslim. Governors asked the local council to investigate him. Eventually he reluctantly agreed to leave the school. Soon after, a Muslim teacher was put in his place, who Mr Bains described as ‘the man they wanted two years ago’. A report by Ofsted into the crisis at the school and the attitude of the head concluded that Mr Bains had a 'dysfunctional' relationship with the governors. Dr Mohammed Khan, who was chair of governors at the school until he resigned, said there was 'no conspiracy' to force out the headteacher. He said: 'We interviewed a number of candidates for the headteacher's job and the panel, which was mainly Muslim, appointed him over other people. If there was an agenda that wouldn't have happened'.","Balwant Bains says he had to leave Saltley School because of harassment .

"Yumi Stynes has hit back at critics who took aim at her following a movie premiere at the weekend, where she took her baby daughter with her on the red carpet wearing a nappy. Earlier on Monday her husband savaged a newspaper columnist who claimed his wife had committed a 'fashion faux pas' by taking their baby to a high-profile event in a nappy. Her choice of attire for her youngest child was critiqued by David Campbell, writing for The Daily Telegraph as 'weird'. He also questioned whether a parent 'worth their salt' would be caught without a change of clothes. The radio personality said the criticism she received was completely unwarranted and the last thing she was trying to do by letting her youngest daughter Mercy dress appropriately for the warm weather was to draw attention to herself. Scroll down for video . Uninhibited: Yumi Stynes attended the Australia premiere of Paddington in Sydney on Sunday, and brought her six-month-old daughter Mercy - who she dressed in only a nappy . The media personality also  attended the premiere with husband Martin Bendeler (left) and two older daughters Anouk, 12, and Dee Dee, 10 . 'I've been to a pile of premieres this year and am never the most interesting person there. Usually I show up because I'm interested in the film, maybe to write about it, not because I'm desperate to get in the social pages!' Ms Stynes told Daily Mail Australia. 'Yesterday I attended the premiere of Paddington with my husband and three daughters because the two older ones were excited to see the film and my husband loves London. 'The last thing we expected was to have s*** hung on us for what our 6-month-old was wearing! 'My littlest girl is a Sydney baby. She was born at the RPA and has spent the entire Spring and Summer getting around in a nappy,' Ms Stynes revealed. 'I don't believe in judging babies by their outfits. More attempts by men to control women, if you ask me!' She has hit back at critics calling the attacks sexist and upsetting for her family . Stynes with her husband Martin Bendeler, who said that being offended by a child in a nappy was 'weird' The mother of three added that it was not the criticism alone that upset her, but the sexist nature of the attack on an innocent baby. 'The thing that makes me sad is my husband was so proud to see his wife and baby daughter getting their photo snapped on the red carpet,' Ms Stynes said. 'He thought Mercy was so cute and calm in the face of all those flashing cameras. And then when we saw that article this morning it was so incredibly judgmental and hostile it actually made my hair stand up on end. '""Baby wears nappy"" is hardly news: it's a breathtakingly sexist attack - and if I am the person who attracts that sort of confected scandal, that's sad for me. But leave my baby daughter out of it,' the media personality said. Stynes tweeted to Campbell that 'Nicole Kidman dresses up for the red carpet. 'WEIRDLY' my baby doesn't share the obligation.' Stynes with her eldest daughters Anouk, 12 (left), and Dee Dee, 10 (right) Mr Campbell's comments were also rebuffed by Mercy's father Martin Bendeler, earlier on Monday. Speaking to Mamamia, he said that there was nothing unusual about the little girl being in a nappy, especially on a hot day when temperatures reached 26C. 'If you’re offended by a six month-old’s nipples, you’re weird,' he said. Ms Stynes and Mr Bendeler married in 2012 and Mercy is their first child together. The former Channel V presenter also had two older daughters Anouk, 12, and Dee Dee, 10. She was one of a number of guests who took their children to the Paddington premiere and was worried that her baby would get too hot. Mr Bendeler said that his wife had a blanket with her in case Mercy got cold. However, Mr Campbell, who has two children, claimed that the child's attire looked 'plain weird'. 'It's important that men keep telling women how to dress and what to wear @DaveyCampbell85. Even 6-month-olds,' Stynes tweeted. 'There was only one fashion faux pas on the red carpet... it wasn’t a celebrity revealing a little too much. It was a baby wearing nothing but a nappy,' he wrote, saying the only excuse would be a 'poo explosion - a bowel movement that requires not only a nappy change but a full wardrobe change.' Mr  Campbell said that as a father of two children, and expecting another, he would have ensured that his kids would have worn at least a singlet and nappy cover. The Paddington premiere, though a red carpet event at Event Cinemas on George Street, was a casual affair, attended by celebrities and their children, as well as ordinary families. Most were dressed in summer attire, and Nicole Kidman, who stars in the film, was the only frocked-up celebrity on the carpet. Ms Stynes expressed outrage at the comments, tweeting to Campbell that 'Nicole Kidman dresses up for the red carpet. 'WEIRDLY' my baby doesn't share the obligation.' 'It's important that men keep telling women how to dress and what to wear @DaveyCampbell85. Even 6-month-olds,' she commented.

"An Australian woman who allegedly sold fake ultrasound photos to pregnant mothers is now facing numerous charges of deception. Scores of mothers-to-be cherished the images that had allegedly been printed of the babies they were carrying in the womb, but concerns grew when the women realised that others had been provided with the same pictures. Now a West Australian woman in the town of Bunbury, running a business called ‘Amazing 4D Imagining’, has been charged with making false and misleading representations to consumers. A woman in West Australia has been charged after she allegedly supplied dozens of expectant mothers with fake 4D ultrasound photos . The un-named woman is alleged to have provided pregnant women with pictures of babies in the womb and claimed they were the same images that the mothers-to-be had seen on the ultrasound screen. But, it will be alleged, the photos the mothers-to-be were given - and cherished - had been downloaded from the internet. The ABC reported on Monday that West Australia’s Department of Commerce had received dozens of complaints. ‘We had an unprecedented 76 actual written complaints in relation to that issue,’ said Ms Debbie Butler of Consumer Protection. Running a business called Amazing 4D Imagining, the woman is accused of using images from the internet and giving them to clients . Dozens of expectant mothers claim to have received the same pictures and are devastated they had been misled . The Bunbury Mail reported earlier this year that more than 100 people had joined a group set up for people who believed they had been given false ultrasound photos of their unborn children. The paper said that the issue had first come to light when a Bunbury woman posted her concerns on Facebook - which resulted in numerous other women coming forward. One mother, Catherine Osment, was said to have paid for an ultrasound DVD and photographs of her unborn baby, attending a private 4D ultrasound home business, but when she received her photographs she said it was ‘clearly obvious’ all eight images were of different babies . ‘I knew as soon as I opened them they were fake and it made me feel sick,’ she said. She added that when she searched the internet she found the same photographs in Google Images. Further checks revealed that the prints had been made before she had had her scan. Women shared images on Facebook to compare the pictures, finding many of them had duplicates . Her partner, she revealed, had even been planning to have the baby’s image tattooed on his chest, but he cancelled the appointment when he realised the photo might not be of his child. A second mother, Jacinta Langford, said she believed an ultrasound photos of her twins had been lifted from Google Images. The Bunbury paper reported the business owner, who could not be named for legal reasons, said she was considering legal action for what she said were defamatory claims, adding that her work was legitimate and professional. Women writing in response to the allegations expressed their horror and dismay with one commenting: ‘What a terrible thing to do to people.’ Women writing in response to the allegations expressed their horror and dismay with one commenting: 'What a terrible thing to do to people' Another wrote: ‘OMG, this is absolutely horrible. I could only image the heartbreak these mothers must be feeling, having 2 kids of my own. My heart goes out to them.’ Yet another commentator wrote that it was ‘heartbreaking watching these parents put ""their"" little images up…and other parents are saying and posting “their” own images EXACTLY THE SAME…it is a disgusting betrayal of trust.’ Others took to Facebook to share and compare images they believed to be duplicates of their own, and pictures which they all believed showed their own children. The charged woman is due to appear before Bunbury Magistrates Court on January 12.","A West Australian woman is facing numerous charges of deception .

Rich's first custom creation - a huge monster-truck, dubbed the D Rex, is based on a 1981 DeLorean's body but mounted onto the running gear of a 1979 Chevrolet K5 Blazer SUV. The huge hybrid is fitted with custom wheels and 44-inch tall tires, twice the size of the average cars and a V8 motor. The Time Machine Replica: The car enthusiast will only use damaged DeLoreans for his projects, as there were under 10,000 of the DMC-12 model ever made before the company went bankrupt. The convertible: He said, 'I have so many different ideas for custom DeLoreans, I'm not sure if time, money or age will stop me from building them but as long as I'm able I'll continue to build them' Rich said: 'Even though the monster truck is a huge project, it actually only took me and my team a month to build it. 'We married the two vehicles together, DeLorean body and 4x4 chassis, and then we did a few monster-sized upgrades.' The car enthusiast will only use damaged DeLoreans for his projects, as there were under 10,000 of the DMC-12 model ever made before the company went bankrupt. The DeLorean limousine stretches the length of a school bus with six distinctive gullwing doors and uses parts from as many as six different damaged cars, all on a custom fabricated, stainless steel stretched frame. His hero: The projects started after Rich met the car's founder John DeLorean at the Cleveland DeLorean Car Show in 2000 and showed him some of his ideas and sketches . The original: His DeLorean obsession pre-dates the Back to the Future movies to when he first saw the DeLorean prototype as a young man in the 1980s (pictured, in a scene from 1990's Back the the Future III) It is 26 feet long and it took Rich several years to acquire all the parts needed from numerous damaged DeLoreans. Rich said: 'It's got three pairs of gull wing doors, so we have six fully operational doors on there, and having six standard-sized gullwing doors has never been attempted, as far as I know, on any kind of limousine. 'Probably for good reason, since gullwing doors are very difficult to try to align exactly right.' Rich from Chicago, Illinois, built a custom hovercraft using the stainless steel panels of the DeLorean and a hovercraft cushion which allows the DeLorean to float over any surface. His DeLorean obsession pre-dates the Back to the Future movies to when he first saw the DeLorean prototype as a young man in the 1980s. Rich said: 'My friends all know me as the guy with the DeLorean, all my co-workers know me by the guy with the DeLoreans. 'My family obviously knows I've been rather obsessed with DeLoreans since I bought my first one back in 1985. 'I have so many different ideas for custom DeLoreans, I'm not sure if time, money or age will stop me from building them but as long as I'm able I'll continue to build them.'","Rich Weissensel, from Chicago, Illinois, customised 5 DeLorean creations .

"Anni Dewani's sister has paid an emotional tribute to her murdered sibling, calling her 'the best sister anybody could wish for' as a South African judge cleared Shrien Dewani of murder. Remembered for her light-hearted and sunny nature, Anni was able to 'see the positive thing in every person', her sister Ami Denborg said, adding that she misses hearing her voice - a sound so familiar from the sisters' childhood in the small town of Mariestad in Sweden. Anni, a 28-year-old engineering graduate, moved to the UK in 2010 to help her millionaire soon-to-be husband Shrien run his PSP Healthcare nursing home business in Bristol, with her good looks inspiring her to apply for the city's 'Top Model' competition under her maiden name Hindocha. Just a few months later she was dead - murdered in a poverty-stricken Cape Town neighbourhood just days after the couple's lavish £200,000 wedding in Mumbai. Anni was found shot through the neck in the back of a taxi which had been hijacked after the couple hired a local driver to show them the 'real Africa'. This morning Shrien Dewani was dramatically cleared of any part in the honeymoon murder after a judge threw out the case against him - saying the testimony of the prosecution's 'star' witness had been 'riddled with contradictions'. Taxi driver Zola Tongo was jailed for 18 years over Anni's killing in December 2010. Two other men - Mzwamadoda Qwabe and Xolile Mngeni - were each jailed for 25 years in 2012 and last November respectively, with Mngeni later dying of brain cancer in October of this year.

Best friends: Describing Anni's personality, Ami Denborg (pictured right alongside her sister) said: 'She had the biggest loving heart for her family and friends... She was always happy, always smiling, she loved life' Describing her sister's personality, Mrs Denborg, 37, said: 'She had the biggest loving heart for her family and friends...She was always happy, always smiling, she loved life, she was very joyful.' 'She was one of a kind. She used to look up to me a lot and that's what I miss about her. She would always give everyone compliments,' Mrs Denborg added. The engineer said the quality most people remember about Anni was her ability to see the positive in every person and every situation and could always make people feel good about themselves. 'She just loved the family, she loved people and she would always tell people how good they were. 'Anni looked up to me, but my relationship with her was that she was my best friend. We could talk about anything. I wouldn't see her as my little sister, even though she was five years younger than me,' Mrs Denborg said. 'We were very, very close as sisters and I would say she was my best friend. I miss her terribly,' she went on to say.

Innocent: Anni Dewani pictured aged three (left) and seven (right) at her family home in Mariestad, Sweden . Following this morning's  verdict, Anni's sister bravely spoke on the steps of the court room within minutes of the judgment. 'We've heard that Shrien left a double life and Anni wasn't aware of it, ' she said, as her father Vinod laid his face on his son Anish's shoulder as he wept, his face crumpled, his tears falling onto his son's suit. Anish also wept, he has been in court every minute of the 25 days of the trial, supporting his parents. His mother, Nilam, was silent in her grief, her face wet with tears. Finally, her voice cracking with emotion, Mrs Denborg summed up the devastation felt by her family, 'We can here for the truth, seeking answers but are led twitch so many unanswered questions, its a very sad day and believe that justice has failed us.' Anni's uncle Ashok said: 'The decision to end the trial without the defendant offering a defence, means we, and the good people of South Africa, the UK and various parts of the world who have followed the case, will always live without ever knowing the complete events that led up to Anni's death.' Judge Jeannette Traverso said that prosecutors arguments had 'fallen far below' the level needed to secure conviction. She attacked the prosecution's chief witness for giving testimony of such 'poor quality' she did not know where the 'lies end and truth begins'. Before her savage murder in a run-down Cape Town neighborhood just days after her 'fairy-tale' Hindu wedding to husband Shrien, Anni hoped her modelling career would flourish in the UK. In the years before her death Anni had moved from her hometown Mariestad to study engineering at the Univesity of Gävle in northern Sweden before relocating again to work for the mobile phone company Eriksson in Stockholm. It was while she was living in the Swedish capital that she decided she wanted to spent more time in the UK. Joy: In June 2010, with the couple having dated for a number of months, Shrien (left) asked Anni's parents for permission to propose to their daughter.

Beauty: Anni Dewani is pictured wearing traditional gowns on her wedding day in Mumbai . Anni initially stayed with her cousin Sneha in Luton in mid-2009, where she met Shrien Dewani through mutual friends. On their first proper date the couple went to watch a production of The Lion King at the Lyceum Theatre in London's West End. Within a few months the couple were alternating their weekends between Bristol, where Shrien lived and worked, and Stockholm, where Anni was still based.

With the couple now engaged, Anni decided that she would move to Bristol on a permanent basis the following month to help her husband run his PSP Healthcare nursing home business. Shortly after arriving, Anni entered Bristol's Top Model competition under her maiden name Hindocha. As with every else in their fast-moving relationship, the couple did not wait long to get married - inviting 500 guests to a lavish three-day Hindu ceremony in Mumbai on October 29, 2010. They planned to host a second civil ceremony in Bristol the following year for friends who had been unable to make the journey to India. Anni's father Vinod has subsequently described the ceremony as 'a drama and false' and said he had largely paid for it. In a recent interview with MailOnline, Mr Hindocha revealed revealed that he and his wife Nilam will sue their son-in-law for not disclosing his bisexuality before marrying their daughter - and hope to receive at least partial compensation for the expense of the wedding.

Anni and Shrien set off on their honeymoon in South Africa shortly after their wedding, arriving at Cape Town International Airport on November 7. Following a short internal flight, the newlyweds spent four nights staying at the Kruger National Park, before returning to Cape Town on November 12. It was on the drive from Cape Town International Airport to their room at five-star Cape Grace Hotel that the pair first encountered taxi driver Zola Tongo. After dinner the pair once again set off in Tongo's Volkswagen Sharan - this time to see the 'real Africa' on the a guided tour of Cape Town's poverty-stricken Gugulethu township. Within minutes the car was hijacked by two armed men and driven for what Shrien claims was roughly 20 minutes - taking the couple 20 minutes from the kidnapping site. It was at this point Shrien says he was thrown from the back of the moving vehicle. He subsequently flagged down a passing car and contacted the police. The vehicle was found two miles from the scene with Anni dead in the back of the taxi, severely beaten and bruised and suffering a single gunshot wound to the neck.

Three men have already been convicted of their role in the killing of Anni Dewani - including cab driver Zola Tongo, who is serving an 18-year jail term. Prosecutors say bisexual Shrien wanted out of the relationship and plotted for Anni to be killed in an apparent botched hijacking. But Dewani, 34, has always denied any involvement in the plot. Dewani, from Westbury-on-Trym, near Bristol, was charged with murder, conspiracy to commit kidnapping, robbery with aggravating circumstances, kidnapping, and defeating the ends of justice. His lawyers last month applied for Judge Traverso to dismiss the case - although they have refused to confirm if Dewani would be free to return to the UK immediately.","Ami Denborg, 37, described sister as 'the best anybody could wish for'

The resignations took place following Hughes' reportedly looking for someone to take Franklin Foer's spot as the editor of The New Republic, according to the The New York Times. Both Foer and literary editor Leon Wieseltier resigned, according to the newspaper. Contributing editor Ryan Lizza, who resigned, told The Times  over 50 editors and contributing editors trailed the two men. Leadership: The New Republic's owner Chris Hughes (left) has penned an op-ed, offering his side in the wake of tens of magazine staffers members quitting their jobs. CEO Guy Vidra (right) has announced hopes that The New Republic could turn into a 'vertically integrated digital media company' ''At the heart of the conflict of the past few days is a divergent view on how the New Republic — and journalism more broadly — will survive,' Hughes wrote in an op-ed for  The Washington Post. 'In one view, it is a ""public trust"" and not a business. It is something greater than a commercial enterprise, ineffable, an ideal that cannot be touched. Financially, it would be a charity [...] At the New Republic, I believe we owe it to ourselves and to this institution to aim to become a sustainable business and not position ourselves to rely on the largesse of an unpredictable few. Our success is not guaranteed, but I think it’s critical to try.' December 22 Snyder is set to start as editor of the magazine, which will cuts its production in half down to 10 issues a year, The New York Times reported. CEO Guy Vidra, formerly of Yahoo!, also announced hopes that The New Republic could turn into a 'vertically integrated digital media company,' according to the newspaper.

'Unless we experiment now, today’s young people will not even recognize the New Republic’s name nor care about its voice when they arrive in the halls of power tomorrow.' At the end of the piece, Hughes attacked those that left The New Republic, writing 'If you really care about an institution and want to make it strong for the ages, you don’t walk out. You roll up your sleeves, you redouble your commitment to those ideals in a changing world, and you fight. This 100-year-old story is worth fighting for.' Hughes' piece referred to an earlier letter signed by twenty editors and contributing editors that was published Friday by The Huffington Post. The letter said 'The New Republic cannot be merely a ""brand."" It has never been and cannot be a ""media company"" that markets ""content."" Its essays, criticism, reportage, and poetry are not ""product."" It is not, or not primarily, a business. It is a voice, even a cause. It has lasted through numerous transformations of the ""media landscape""—transformations that, far from rendering its work obsolete, have made that work ever more valuable.

"At least 21 people were reported dead and thousands of homes swept away by Typhoon Hagupit as millions more in the Philippine capital braced themselves for its arrival today. More than a million people fled their homes as the typhoon approached the country from the Pacific, fearing a repeat of a super storm last year that left more than 7,000 dead or missing. Most of the dead drowned as flood waters rose in Borongan, the main town in Eastern Samar, where the typhoon made its first landfall, said the Philippine National Red Cross. Scroll down for videos . Wet: A Filipino man negotiates a flooded rice field in Albay province, eastern Philippines, as the country hunkered down from a battering by Typhoon Hagupit, the most powerful storm to hit the so far this year . Struggle: A resident wades in floodwaters bought by Typhoon Hagupit in Camarines Sur province, where people had today begun returning to their homes after the worst of the typhoon passed over the weekend .

Chipping in: Boys salvage belongings from the still turbulent waters as they return to their homes in Legazpi . The predicted path of tropical storm Hagupit, churning towards the Philippine capital Manila on Monday . In Metro Manila, a coastal megalopolis of 12million that often endures deadly flooding, evacuation efforts were in full swing as forecasters warned of downpours from dusk. However Hagupit weakened from a typhoon as it moved slowly across the central Philippines, fuelling cautious optimism the disaster-weary nation may avoid another calamity involving hundreds of deaths. 'We are on 24-hour alert for floods and storm surges... it's the flooding that we are worried about,' said Joseph Estrada, mayor of Manila, the original city of two million within Metro Manila. Thousands of people from the shanty towns perched along Manila's coast and riverbands were crammed into schools and other evacuation centres throughout the city. Schools were suspended, the stock market closed, office and government workers told to stay at home and dozens of flights cancelled. President Benigno Aquino led the preparations as part of a massive effort to keep people safe. Last year 7,350 people died when Super Typhoon Haiyan devastated large parts of the central Philippines in November. Millions of people living in the direct path of Hagupit over the weekend were sent to evacuation centres or ordered to remain in their homes. Devastation: Children play in the remains of a house destroyed by Typhoon Hagupit in Dolores, Samar, in central Philippines, where the storm first made landfall and where most deaths have been reported . Aftermath: Thousands of homes are feared to have been damaged or swept away by the fierce storm . Picking up the pieces: A typhoon victim recover clothes in the remains of her house in Dolores . Survival: A girl scoops rice from a pot outside a house destroyed in Can-avid, Samar province . Still to come: People carry their belongings towards an evacuation center in Atimonan town, Quezon province, south of Manila as they take cover from the advancing storm today . Places of safety: A family struggle through the winds as they make their way to the evacuation centre in Atimonan. More than a million people have fled their homes as part of the evacuation efforts . Livelihood: A fisherman inspects his small banca after heavy rain and strong winds batter Atimonan . The storm was the strongest to hit the Philippines this year, with gusts of up to 130mph when it made landfall on Saturday night. Thousands of homes were destroyed, power lines were torn down, landslides choked roads, and flood waters up to one storey high flowed through some towns. Gwendolyn Pang, secretary-general of the Philippine National Red Cross, told Reuters: 'We have confirmed reports that 21 people died in Eastern Samar, 16 of them in Borongan.' Borongan, capital of Eastern Samar province, is one of the main cities along Samar's east coast that faces the Pacific Ocean and just 30 miles south of where Hagupit struck . Ms Pang said it was impossible to say whether the death toll would climb, with full damage assessments from some areas that were hit yet to come in and the storm still travelling across the country. Defences: A man on his bike looks through the sandbags stacked up on Roxas Boulevard, along Manila Bay . Emergency measures: Sandbags bearing the initials of the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority . Last ditch efforts: MMDA workers help to build defences ahead of the expected arrival of the storm in Manila . Vulnerable: Residents are seen at their shanty house built right on the sea wall of Manila's port area . Rickety: Most of the city's shanty town residents have been evacuated from their homes ahead of the storm . Fragile: Shanty houses hang right across the waters of Manila's port . Before the reports of the deaths, presidential spokeswoman Abigail Valte and other government officials were optimistic that evacuations had saved many lives. 'Preemptive evacuation was carried out and warnings by authorities were taken seriously,' Ms Valte told AFP. In Tacloban, a city of 220,000 people that was one of the worst-hit during Haiyan, heavy winds destroyed homes but authorities said there were no casualties over the weekend. 'There is a collective sigh of relief... we were better prepared after Yolanda,' Tacloban vice mayor Jerry Yaokasin told AFP on Sunday, referring to Haiyan by its Philippine name. However just as crucially, Hagupit's winds were significantly weaker than Haiyan, which was the strongest storm ever recorded on land. There was also no repeat of Haiyan's tsunami-like storm surges. Hagupit's sustained winds dropped to 87mph on Sunday, then continued to weaken after leaving the eastern Philippine islands and passing over the Sibuyan Sea southeast of Manila. Its winds were down to 68mph on Monday and were expected to weaken further as it passed just south of the capital in the evening, according to local weather agency Pagasa. However Pagasa said the winds were still capable of doing major damage to homes, and heavy rains were expected within Hagupit's 280-mile-wide weather front.","Most dead reported in eastern province where the storm made landfall .
More than a million people have been evacuated from their homes .

The Jerusalem Nano Bible company has developed a tiny version of part of the sacred texts, which can be worn around the neck or even embedded inside a watch. Measuring less than 0.2 inches (5mm) across, the company is seeking validation from the Guinness World Records that it is indeed the world's smallest Bible - although you'll need a microscope to read it. Scroll down for video . The Jerusalem Nano Bible company says they've made the world's smallest Bible (shown). Here it is shown on display at TowerJazz Semiconductor Ltd in Migdal Haemek in northern Israel. The nano-sized New Testament has been nominated for the Guinness World Records as the World's Smallest Bible . On just one face of the square chip, 27 books of the New Testament have been printed. The tiny biblical text uses the Greek version of the New Testament, Textus Receptus, or 'received text' in Latin. Each chip is made from a silicon wafer, with their sides measuring a minuscule 0.19 inches (4.76mm). On the chips, each letter has a width of about 0.18 microns (18 millionths of a metre), so an eight-inch (20.3cm) wafer can apparently contain more than 1,000 Bibles. An academic scholar validated, with the use of a microscope, that  the text was indeed that of the New Testament.

It was written by Malcolm Douglas Chaplin and published by his brother, Robert, at the Simon Fraser University, in British Columbia, Canada. The book's exact measurements are 70 micrometres by 100 micrometres. Its pages, which are too small to be read even using a microscope, are printed on a single tablet.

"Mr Justice Moylan has ruled that the son of two Jehovah's Witness parents should receive a blood transfusion if he needs it for treatment for burns . A High Court judge has ruled that the son of two devout Jehovah's Witnesses can be given a blood transfusion despite religious objections from his parents. Mr Justice Moylan was told by doctors that the 'very young' boy had suffered severe burns in an accident and might need a blood transfusion. But the family division of the High Court in London heard the child's parents have 'deeply-held views' which means they object to their son having the transfusion. The judge said he had made the ruling in the interest of the boy's welfare. In a written ruling, Mr Justice Moylan said: 'I am extremely grateful to (the boy's) father for so clearly and calmly explaining to me the position held by himself and (the boy's) mother.' ]'I have no doubt at all that they love their son dearly. I also have no doubt that they object to the receipt by (their son) of a blood transfusion because of their devout beliefs. 'I hope they will understand why I have reached the decision which I have, governed as it is by (their son's) welfare.' Jehovah's witnesses have firm religious beliefs that the new and old testaments command they do not transfer blood, so they do not accept blood transfusions. This has led to a number of 'bloodless' treatments developing. The judge said a health trust with responsibility for treating the boy had asked for a ruling. He did not name anyone involved and did not give the child's age. The ruling follows similar decisions by two High Court judges earlier this year. Mr Justice Keehan gave permission for a baby boy to undergo blood transfusions during an operation after being told by a specialist that he had no 'long-term prospect of survival' if he did not have cardiac surgery. Mr Justice Moylan gave the ruling after a hearing at the Family Division of the High Court in London and said he made the decision in the interests of the boy's welfare and hoped his devout parents would understand . The baby's parents had agreed to surgery but said they could not consent to their son, who is a few weeks old, receiving blood. But Mr Justice Keehan concluded that receiving blood was in the little boy's best interests, despite his parents' 'understandable objections'. Birmingham Children's Hospital had applied for an order that surgery could proceed with blood transfusions. Jehovah's Witnesses said their attitude to blood transfusions stems from biblical teachings. They claim the Old and New Testaments command them to 'abstain from blood' and they should not ingest it. Followers say this is stipulated in passages in Genesis, Leviticus, Deuteronomy and Acts. One example is in Genesis 9:4 : 'God told Noah: 'Only flesh with its soul - its blood - you must not eat.'' The belief has led to the development of a number of 'bloodless medicines', with surgeons developing procedures which can be performed without having to do a transfusion. However Mr Justice Peter Jackson gave doctors permission not to administer blood transfusions to a 63-year-old woman who was a Jehovah's Witness. The woman had subsequently died. Doctors working for Newcastle upon Tyne Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust had asked for permission to withhold a blood transfusion. They said the woman, who had been a Jehovah's Witness since the 1970s at least and had a history of depression and paranoid schizophrenia, was 'gravely ill'. Mr Justice Peter Jackson said that when doctors made the application the woman had 'clearly lacked' the mental capacity to make or communicate decisions about treatment. But the judge said that after being admitted to hospital the woman had been 'adamant' that she did not want treatment with any blood products. He concluded that the woman had made a decision, when she had the mental capacity, that doctors rightly considered had to be respected. The judge said the human right to life was 'fundamental' but not absolute. He said there was no obligation on a patient to accept life-saving treatment and doctors were not entitled or obliged to give treatment.","Boy suffered severe burns in accident and medics said he may need blood .

"Biologists are hunting for an ivory thief who sawed off seven teeth from a dead orca who was pregnant with a full-term fetus.

When experts arrived Saturday to perform an autopsy on the marine mammal they were dismayed to find her carcass had been looted. Scroll down for video . Sad ending: The 18-year-old killer whale J-32, nicknamed Rhapsody, was found floating in the water last Thursday off Vancouver Island in Canada . Theft: When experts arrived Saturday to perform an autopsy on the marine mammal they were dismayed to find her carcass had been looted . A couple of teeth had reportedly been broken off and others sawed off at the jawline. 'Someone last night, selfishly, cruelly, illegally cut off several teeth from her. 'It’s a crime that can’t be described. It’s a crime against science,' Marcie Callewaert of the Victoria Marine Science Association told CTV News. Jean Rowe, a resident from the city of Courtenay who had been keeping an eye on J-32 as her body lay taped off on the beach, said she was 'devastated' about the theft. She suspected someone had taken the teeth to sell as ivory or to keep as a trophy. The necropsy on J-32 showed she was pregnant with a full-term fetus. Experts had speculated the death may have arisen from birth complications. Mother-to-be: The necropsy on J-32 showed she was pregnant with a full-term fetus . Happier times: J-32, seen at right, was a member of the J-pod, one of three families of southern resident killer whales that spend time in the inland waters of Washington state and Canada . Tissue samples from the mother and child will be sent to labs across North America, with results expected in four to six weeks. The skeletons will be donated to the Royal B.C. Museum. Locals are appealing for the teeth to be returned so J-32 can go on display in her complete state. The expectant mother was a member of the J-pod, one of three families of southern resident killer whales that spend time in the inland waters of Washington state and Canada. She was reportedly last photographed on November 26 with her family east of Victoria, . The death leaves 77 animals in the Puget Sound orca population. Despite a decade of research, protection and recovery efforts, the animals continue to struggle primarily due to lack of food, pollution and disturbances from marine vessels.","The 18-year-old killer whale J-32, nicknamed Rhapsody, was found floating in the water last Thursday off Vancouver Island in Canada .

"With families across the country wanting a majestic fir to display in their homes this holiday season, it's the busiest time of the year for Christmas tree farms. And it appears the most efficient way to collect the trees is by using a really fast chopper. It would probably take several burly men hours to drag the trees from where they are felled to a nearby pick-up truck. But at the Noble Mountain Tree Farm in Salem, Oregon, a handy helicopter and its skilled pilot hoist no less than four trees into a truck in this 90-second clip. Scroll down for video . At the Noble Mountain Tree Farm in Salem, Oregon, a time-saving trick means more Christmas trees can be transported quicker . In just 90 seconds, the skilled helicopter pilot hoists a total of four trees into a nearby pick-up truck . The helicopter picks up the trees on a tether and carries them through the air, before dropping them carefully into the truck. And despite the foggy sky, the pilot appears to have no trouble navigating at all and instead shows off his skill by completing the task as quickly as possible. In a clear indication of the pilot's speed, three trucks can be seen lined up along the road in the video, waiting to be filled.

"The number of UK households with a television has fallen for the first time, with viewers switching to computers, tablets and smartphones to watch their favourite programmes. The figures have been branded ‘bad news for the BBC’ by MPs who said the shift from traditional television viewing ‘undermines the case for the licence fee’ and strengthens the argument for funding the corporation through a subscription model. Online catch-up services, such as BBC iPlayer, ITV Player and 4OD, mean shows such as Strictly Come Dancing, X Factor and Gogglebox no longer need to be watched while they are broadcast but can be viewed later online free of charge. The number of UK households with a television has fallen for the first time, with viewers switching to computers, tablets and smartphones to watch their favourite programmes; the BBC's Strictly Come Dancing, above, can be watched online . Watching live television – even via the internet – requires the viewer to purchase the £145.50 licence fee, but this is not necessary to watch catch-up services. According to Ofcom, 300,000 fewer homes had televisions at the end of last year than at the end of 2012, dropping from 26.33million to 26.02million. The regulator’s Infrastructure Report, released yesterday, also revealed that almost one million homes have a broadband connection but no television, indicating they are watching programmes through other devices. Critics claim this shift away from TV sets makes the licence fee unenforceable. Philip Davies MP, a member of the Culture, Media and Sport select committee, said: ‘In terms of the practicalities of the licence fee, it’s dependant of families having a big TV in the corner of the living room. ‘You can’t collect a licence fee for a TV if nobody’s got one. It certainly undermines the case for the licence fee. How do you enforce a licence fee for people who aren’t watching through a traditional TV? It just becomes unenforceable, that’s the problem the BBC has got.’ In June, the Daily Mail revealed 463,846 people avoided buying a TV licence by declaring they had not owned a set or watched live shows in the past year. Next year’s review of the BBC’s charter will see the funding system of the licence fee up for debate. Online catch-up services, such as BBC iPlayer, above, ITV Player and 4OD, mean shows such as Strictly Come Dancing, X Factor and Gogglebox no longer need to be watched while they are broadcast but can be viewed later online free of charge . Alternatives have so far included a subscription service, a modernised licence fee such as charging for iPlayer, or even the abolition of the fee altogether. Angie Bray MP, also a member of the Culture, Media and Sport select committee, said: ‘That’s the debate, whether the licence fee is relevant in the 21st century. ‘I put forward the idea of a partial subscription model, with the BBC still producing its news and current affairs and the big events it does so well on a channel free for use, with its more niche broadcasting available through subscription.’ Culture Secretary Sajid Javid has announced a review of TV licence enforcement, which could include decriminalisation. Addressing the Royal Television Society in the autumn, he said: ‘In 2012/13, almost 200,000 people ended up in court accused of not buying a TV licence. More than 50 went to prison. When over 10 per cent of magistrates’ court cases concern this one offence, you have to ask whether the current system is really working.’ Ofcom highlighted BBC figures revealing that in July this year, 47 per cent of people accessing iPlayer were doing so through tablets or mobiles, an increase from just 25 per cent in October 2012. The report said there are now approximately 900,000 households with access to the internet but no television set and so rely on internet services to watch programmes. On average, people in the UK watch four hours of television a day, with ‘linear viewing’ – meaning watching show at the time when it is broadcast – still being the most popular way of consuming television. Younger people watch less television than older generations, with only half of viewing by 16- to 24-year-olds being through a television at the time of broadcast. This compares with 82 per cent of the over-65s. Figures from the first quarter of 2014 also reveal 61 per cent of adults own a smartphone, while 44 per cent of homes have a tablet . Although the level of television viewing dropped by 4 per cent in 2013, Ofcom has said it is ‘not yet clear whether this was the beginning of a longer-term trend or merely a temporary variation.’ Younger people watch less television than older generations, with only half of viewing by 16- to 24-year-olds being through a television at the time of broadcast. This compares with 82 per cent of the over-65s. Figures from the first quarter of 2014 also reveal 61 per cent of adults own a smartphone, while 44 per cent of homes have a tablet. The average UK household or small business downloads the equivalent of 35 feature films each month, in terms of its data usage. And each household also uploads an amount of data equal to 3,500 digital photographs. Ofcom’s infrastructure report has revealed the average household downloads 53 Gigabytes (GB) of data on their fixed broadband line every month – a rise of 77 per cent from last year. They also upload 7GB of data to the internet. Despite the surge in households viewing TV online, busy urban areas, including swathes of central London have poor or no superfast broadband coverage, according to Ofcom.These ‘not-spots’ include areas such as Charing Cross and Oxford Street, as well as areas in central Manchester and Birmingham. Ofcom reports that 75 per cent of UK premises have superfast broadband coverage.‘Not-spots’ are often caused when there is no street cabinet to upgrade, leaving customers to rely on a local telephone exchange to connect. The streetside metal boxes contain the necessary wiring to connect homes to superfast broadband .","300,000 fewer homes had TVs at the end of 2013 than at the end of 2012 .

"A strip club DJ who performs under the name DJ Awesome allegedly hired his best friend to kill his own wife before embarking on a social media grieving campaign for her. Andre Jason Pugh, 34, who lives and works in Atlanta, Georgia, was arrested Saturday and charged with murdering his wife, Tiffany, who was reportedly trying to divorce him. He was booked into jail alongside his best friend Adrian Harley, whom police say he hired to break into their home and kill his wife with a gun on November 23. 'Hired a hitman': Andre Pugh, left, also known as DJ Awesome, allegedly hired his best friend Adrian Harley, right, to kill his wife Tiffany Pugh . Murdered: Tiffany Pugh was shot dead at her Atlanta home on November 23. Pugh called 911 when he found her, saying an intruder did it, but officers were suspicious of his story . Investigators say Pugh called 911 after coming home and finding his slain wife, telling operators that somebody must have broken in, according to Fox 5 News. But officers did not believe his story and believe that he hired Harley, with whom he works at Onyx Atlanta, a strip club, to stage the break in and kill his wife. The exact circumstances leading up to the killing remain unclear. According to one of the DJ's posts, the couple had been together 11 years and have a son and a daughter. Charges: Pugh and Harley, shown left and right respectively in police mugshots, were charged with murder, conspiracy to murder and conspiracy to commit burglary . Strip club performer: Pugh, pictured above in a promotional poster, works at Onyx Atlanta, a strip club . Home: Pugh called 911 on November 23 saying he had found his wife shot dead at their home, shown above . On the job: Pugh, shown above behind the turntables, posted social media updates talking about how he missed his wife. Days later he was arrested for her murder . On the day Tiffany Pugh was killed, Pugh posted to his Facebook page saying: 'Why did they take my wife?! My kids [sic] mom why?! Where did i go wrong?!' Several days later he uploaded a message to his dead wife's Facebook profile, saying: 'I'm trying my best not to cry but seeing you in a state where I'm not used to it hurting me... I miss you love you and want you back so much.' A promotional DJ Awesome website says Pugh was born in The Bronx, New York City, and got his first set of turntables aged 13. He moved to Atlanta in the early 2000s and claims to have hosted numerous radio shows before starting at Onyx, a strip club on the outskirts of the city. Pugh and Harley have both been charged with conspiracy to commit murder, conspiracy to commit burglary, and murder. They are due in court Monday. Members of Pugh's family told Fox 5 that they believe the allegations against him are false. 'Where did I go wrong?!': Pugh, who changed his Facebook profile picture to an image of him with his wife, left, after her death, later posted messages to her profile saying he missed her .

"Google his trying to halt a British court challenge over alleged secret tracking of internet users who claim their privacy has been breached. The internet giant is challenging a decision by a High Court judge in January that allowed Google to be sued in the UK for allegedly bypassing security settings to track the online browsing of Apple's Sarafi users and target them with personalised advertisements. The landmark case is being brought by a group of more than 100 people known as Safari Users Against Google’s Secret Tracking, which includes editor and publisher Judith Vidal-Hall as well as IT security company directors Robert Hann and Marc Bradshaw. Campaigners: IT security company director Marc Bradshaw (left) and editor and publisher Judith Vidal-Hall (right) are part of a group which claims Google bypassed security settings to track their online browsing . They say Google’s 'clandestine' tracking and collation of internet usage between summer 2011 and spring 2012 has led to distress and embarrassment among UK users. If they win, it potentially leaves Google facing claims from millions of people who were using Apple devices in 2010. Today, lawyers for Google told the Court of Appeal that Mr Justice Tugendhat in the High Court impermissibly failed to apply binding legal authority on two issues of law which were of general importance in the field of privacy and consequently erred in declaring that the court had jurisdiction. They also say that he got it wrong in several respects in his assessment of whether there were serious issues to be tried. 'In the result, the judge wrongly dismissed the appellant's application to set aside service of proceedings out of the jurisdiction, and his ruling should be reversed,' Antony White QC told the Master of the Rolls Lord Dyson, Lord Justice McFarlane and Lady Justice Sharp. Challenge: Google is challenging a decision by a High Court judge that the UK courts were the 'appropriate jurisdiction' to try claims brought by the group, known as Safari Users Against Google’s Secret Tracking . Hugh Tomlinson QC, for the group, said that the judge was right to hold that misuse of private information was a tort - a civil wrong - for the purposes of the rules governing service out of the jurisdiction and that the case raised important issues concerning the gathering of information by an international internet company. Google says that dissatisfied users of the Apple Safari internet browser should have launched their claims for misuse of private information in the United States, where Google is based. Dan Tench, a partner at law firm Olswang which is representing the claimants, said: 'Google has already failed in the High Court to prevent the claimants from bringing this case in England. 'It felt that California was a better place for such a claim, a venue that would clearly be beyond the means of many British people. Argument: Google's lawyers told the Court of Appeal that Mr Justice Tugendhat in the High Court  failed to apply binding legal authority on two issues of law, and so erred in declaring the court had jurisdiction . A group of Apple iPhone and iPad users are suing Google, claiming the internet giant secretly tracking their browsing habits in order to bombard them with targeted adverts. The claimants, known as Safari Users Against Google's Secret Tracking, all used Apple's Safari browser and have accused Google of bypassing security settings in order to track their online browsing and target them with adverts. They say that cookies, small tracking files, were installed by Google on the Apple computers and mobile devices of those using the Safari internet browser without their knowledge. Cookies are used by advertisers, and owners of other websites, to target advertising based on an individual's internet use. The campaigners also say that Google's 'clandestine' tracking and collation of internet usage between summer 2011 and spring 2012 has led to distress and embarrassment among UK users. The claimants are accusing Google of misuse of private information, breach of confidence and breaking data protection laws. The landmark case could pave the way for up to 10 million Britons to sue Google for alleged privacy breaches. 'This is why we argued, successfully, that the breach took place here and so the case should be brought here. Google's now appealing against the decision. 'It's arguing that if people have not lost out financially from a privacy breach then they should not be allowed to sue. 'We stand by the decision of the earlier court that declared, for the first time, that the breach of privacy is a tort thereby opening up Google's transgressions to English courts. The regulator, it seems, agrees. It has asked to intervene in the case and supports our position.' The Information Commissioner, Christopher Graham, has intervened in the landmark case by making written submissions to the Court of Appeal, arguing that there is a 'serious issue' to be tried. Mr Graham has received permission by the court to make submissions on two specific elements of the claim - whether there is a serious issue to be tried as to whether the information at issue is 'personal data' under the Data Protection Act 1998 (DPA), and whether there is a serious issue to be tried as to whether the meaning of 'damages' under section 13 DPA includes non-monetary loss. Cause: Ms Vidal-Hall said the case had 'enormous relevance in that British people should have some means to hold Google to account' In his submissions, which have been handed into the court, he argued: 'There is a serious issue to be tried on the question of whether the BGI data amounts to 'personal data.' 'There is a serious issue to be tried on the question of whether 'damage' in s.13 includes non-pecuniary damage.' Mr Graham, said that the information gathered by Google, regardless of whether they store people's names, is 'personal data' because it allows the company to target individuals with tailored advertising. He said: 'Browser-Generated Information (BGI) in the hands of the Defendant is itself 'personal data' for the purposes of the DPA. 'This is because it comprises both detailed information about websites accessed from a particular device, in other words a user's browsing history and information derived from use of the Defendant's DoubleClick cookie.' He added this allows Google to 'to recognise that the user of that device is present online' and 'to target adverts at the user based on inferences about their interests derived from analysis of their browsing history.' He continued: 'There must be an effective remedy for breach of an individual's data privacy, even where the breach merely gives rise to distress.' The claimants say that this case has 'enormous' significance to the British public and if Google are successful in its appeal they would be free to use people's personal information for whatever commercial gain they chose. Claimant Mr Bradshaw said: 'This is a crucial case for British Internet users. It arose when Google ignored the wishes of people using Apple's Safari web browser not to be tracked and tracking cookies were placed on their laptops. 'We believe that if we choose not to be tracked online, Google should respect our wishes. We feel it entirely wrong that Google could track people online even when they did not seek to use Google's services at all.' Ms Vidal-Hall, added: '170 people have asked to join this case. It clearly has enormous relevance in that British people should have some means to hold Google to account. 'Unless we are successful, Google will be free to use Britons' personal information for whatever commercial purposes it chooses and no matter how that information was obtained. That would be dangerous for society and would render us second class citizens in comparison to those in the United States, where Google has paid a fine for the Safari security breach.' The hearing was adjourned until a date to be arranged in the new year for further argument on the remaining issues. After January's ruling a Google spokeswoman said: 'A case almost identical to this one was dismissed in its entirety three months ago in the US. We still don't think that this case meets the standards required in the UK for it to go to trial.' But Mr Tench said: 'The Court of Appeal hearing will decide whether British consumers actually have any right to hold Google to account in this country. 'This is the appropriate forum for this case - here in England where the consumers used the internet and where they have a right to privacy.'","Group claims Google bypassed security to track their online browsing .

Crash: A woman died today after her car collided with an ambulance near Mennock, Dumfries and Galloway . Shocking: Two crew members and a female casualty from an earlier road accident who was in the ambulance . The other three were not seriously injured and were transferred by road to Dumfries and Galloway Royal Infirmary. Ms Clark had been driving her Vauxhall Corsa near Mennock at about 8.40am. The accident on the A76 involving the driver, from Carronbridge, Thornhill, came as drivers were warned to take extra care on journeys and allow more time as snow and ice cause disruption. The road has been closed for an investigation to be carried out and the procurator fiscal has been informed of the circumstances. Police Scotland said it was too early to say whether freezing conditions had contributed to the accident but drivers are advised to avoid the area. An ambulance spokesman said: ‘At approximately 8.40am an ambulance was involved in a collision with another car on the A76 near Mennock while transferring two patients to hospital in Dumfries. ‘Our deepest sympathies go out to the family of the driver of the car, who tragically died. One member of the ambulance crew was been airlifted to hospital with potentially serious injuries. ‘The other crew member and the patients were also taken to hospital by ambulance but are not seriously injured.’ Officers are working with the council to ensure safe diversions are put in place as some smaller roads nearby have not yet been gritted. Dangerous conditions: The accident on the A76 at 8.40am comes as drivers were warned to take extra care . The road has been closed for an investigation to be carried out and the procurator fiscal has been informed . There have also been several incidents on the A74 near Moffat and Beattock, also in Dumfries and Galloway. A Police Scotland spokesman said: ‘Freezing conditions are currently making for difficult driving conditions and drivers should check their routes before setting off.’ Firefighters have issued a warning following an incident yesterday in which a man and a woman were rescued from a car after it left the snow-affected A736 Lochlibo Road in North Ayrshire. Scottish Fire and Rescue Service watch manager Paul Timmons said: ‘The weather has definitely turned for the worse in the past couple of days, so we would urge everyone to keep the conditions in mind whenever they're on the road. ‘Snow, sleet and rain all reduce visibility and mean slippery road surfaces, making it more likely people will experience a collision. It can happen to any of us but there are things we can do to reduce the risk. ‘Driving at a safe speed - one that's appropriate for the conditions as well as within the limit - will help protect ourselves, our passengers and others. ‘It's important that drivers remember it takes a much bigger distance to stop when the road is wet, so we always need to make sure there's a big enough gap to the vehicle in front.’ Elsewhere, snow-affected routes including the A9 at Drumochter, the A85 at Glen Ogle and the A93 between Ballater and Glenshee this morning. Police Scotland said it was too early to say whether freezing conditions had contributed to the accident . Elsewhere: A lorry goes along the A93 in Glenshee as blustery and wintry weather sweeps across Britain . Icy conditions were also reported on the M8 as well as on many routes across the Highlands, Western Isles and north east of Scotland. A Met Office ‘be aware’ warning is in place for high winds for  the rest of this week, with the potential for gusts of 60-70mph rising to 70-80mph in north-western areas. Forecasters say storm-force winds could batter parts of western and northern Scotland with a risk that large waves could cause spray and over-topping in coastal areas. Members of the public are being warned of the potential for disruption to travel and power supplies. And a poll by Asda found that Britain’s motorists will spend a total of five million hours defrosting their cars, with two in four admitting to driving with poor visibility due to running late for work. Meanwhile, in England, there was more morning misery for rail commuters today with hold-ups into major London stations as well as severe disruption to Eurostar services. The latest in what has been a series of early-winter signalling problems - at Acton in west London - led to delays of up to 60 minutes to services in and out of London’s Paddington station. Trains between London and the West Country and Wales were affected, with fewer trains able to run. There were also delays of up to one hour to trains in and out of Liverpool Street station in London due to over-running engineering works. This affected travellers on Abellio Greater Anglia services.","Two crew members and female casualty from earlier accident injured .

"200 passengers on-board the Dawn Princess cruise ship have been confined to their cabins after an outbreak of the norovirus struck the ship while it was travelling around New Zealand. The ship, which is carrying 1500 passenger, was sailing around  Fiordland National Park when the virus was detected and is currently on-route to Melbourne. The ship is on a 13-day cruise around New Zealand and is returning to Melbourne today, which will be it's last stop. 200 passengers on-board the Dawn Princess cruise ship have been confined to their cabins after an outbreak of the norovirus struck the ship while it was travelling around New Zealand . The norovirus is a gastrointestinal illness, which typically lasts one to three days. It causes stomach pain, nausea, diarrhoea and vomiting. The virus can be contracted by food contamination, person-to-person contact or by the contamination of surfaces. Local authorities in New Zealand carried out tests on-board and confirmed that it was an outbreak of the highly contagious virus. In a statement, a Princess Cruises spokesman said that most passengers on the cruise have been unaffected by the bug and that it is under control. 'Some passengers on Dawn Princess' current cruise to New Zealand destinations reported gastrointestinal symptoms confirmed as norovirus, commonly referred to in the community as a 'stomach bug'.' the spokesman said. The norovirus is a gastrointestinal illness, which typically lasts one to three days.It causes stomach pain, nausea, diarrhoea and vomiting . 'It takes relatively few cases to be reported on-board for even more stringent sanitation levels to be implemented. 'The containment response was timely and effective and the number of new cases has declined significantly.' He said that every effort has been made to limit any new cases of the bug. Staff have been disinfecting surfaces such as rails, door handles and elevator buttons, . The ship, which is carrying 1500 passenger, was sailing around Fiordland National Park when the virus was detected and is currently on-route to Melbourne . He also confirmed that infected passengers have been confined to their cabins, until they can be deemed non-contagious. Passengers have been urged to use their private toilet facilities and use sanitising gels located throughout the ship. All self-service in food areas has been closed off on the ship. Dr Alistair Humphrey, Canterbury Medical Officer of Health told the New Zealand Herald that the Dawn Princess was confident it could contain the bug and has it's own doctor on-board. 'The number of cases is declining. They're still seeing a few coming in but not as many,' Dr Humphrey said. 'They stand at a little over 200 people altogether.' According to other news outlets, a Dunedin tour operator has slammed the crew of the Dawn Princess for failing to reveal the true extent of the virus. According to the operator, they only learnt about the quarantine of passengers after it was reported on social media. Local authorities in New Zealand carried out tests on-board and confirmed that it was an outbreak of the highly contagious virus . Dr Humphreys said it may take days for a person's symptoms to become obvious and supported the isolation of infected passengers. 'Generally speaking [patients] are most infectious when they're symptomatic, which is why it's important to keep people isolated in their cabins...' he said. The latest outbreak is the second norovirus outbreak on the Dawn Princess this year alone, with a 75 day cruise through Asia and Alaska also affected. A similar outbreak of the strain also occurred on the ship two years ago. 114 passengers and 11 crew fell ill. The ship has a guest capacity of 1,999 and was last refurbished in June 2009.","200 passenger on-board a cruise ship have contracted the norovirus .

"It's a stunt that would terrify most men - having a live snake in their trousers. But this man did it just to get a few laughs from his fellow participants on a jungle survival skills expedition in Bolivia. Video of the stunt shows the man casually walking away from the camera and unzipping his trousers as he prepares to relieve himself. He then finishes with a bit of a shake, before turning around to face the camera. As he does so a boa constrictor can be seen poking out of the front of his zipper. The snake then proceeds to slither out. According to the camera man, the stuntman had several years experience handling dangerous and poisonous animals in the region, and performed the trick simply to lighten the mood. According to the Mirror he said: 'The presence of a boa constrictor at your side will help you urinate better and will also prevent small rodents from entering your clothing.'

"A garden centre advertising for a cook told applicants who claim benefits that their CV would be put in the bin. A staff member at Hastings Garden Centre in East Sussex posted the advert on Facebook page 'The Bexhill-On-Sea Group' in the hunt for a new chef, but caused outrage with members. It read: 'I need a reliable staff member at the Hastings Garden Centre Cafe as a cook. The staff member from Hastings Garden Centre posted the job advert on a Facebook group asking for a cook . 'If you are in receipt of benefits your application is going in the bin. Send cv to my inbox please.' The notice, which is believed to have been posted by garden centre worker, Gavin Oram, was quickly removed - but not before many of the group's 5,500 members had seen it. Local Lisa Giddon said: 'How horrible, what about genuine people on benefits because they want a job?' Alan James added: 'I have just had to claim JSA after 11 years continuous employment. 'It is quite degrading being scrutinised by the job centre on your efforts to find work. The Facebook post, by Gavin Oram, said 'if you are in receipt of benefits your application is going in the bin' 'His post was derogatory towards benefit claimants, insulting and infuriating.' Colin Boylett wrote: 'How to lose potential customers in one easy lesson.' But Mr Oram stood by the offensive notice and told members: 'It's not getting reworded. 'I already have my books full of benefit claimants and don't need any more.' Wyevale Garden Centres, which runs the store, has apologised for the comments. A spokesman said the views expressed by the member of staff on Facebook did not represent the view of the company. Jason Danciger, food and beverage director, said: 'Wyevale Garden Centres would like to apologise for the comments made by a colleague on The Bexhill-On-Sea Group. 'The views of the individual in no way represent the views of Wyevale Garden Centres and we are sincerely sorry for any offence these comments may have caused. 'Our recruitment and selection policy states 'All candidates who apply for jobs will receive fair treatment and will be considered solely on their ability to do the job'. 'We are investigating this internally and will take the appropriate management action.' An expert from the Citizens Advice Bureau told MailOnline that while discrimination against a person who claims benefits is not specified under the Equality Act 2010, it could still be argued as illegal. 'Being on benefits isn't against the Equality Act, but the job advert could be argued as discriminatory,' they said. 'The act protects certain characteristics such as age, race, gender, disability and so on. If a person is disabled and claiming disability allowance they could certainly argue they had been discriminated against'.","Staff member at Hastings Garden Centre posted advert on Facebook group .

"A man hunting whitetail deer in Kansas last week thought he'd bagged an 8-point trophy buck he could show off back home in North Carolina. Chuck Rorie was right about one thing: the deer sported an impressive rack, but it wasn't a buck . It was a doe. Rorie realized his understandable mistake while skinning the animal. 'It didn’t have the right private parts,' he told the Wichita Eagle. Rorie, who calls Monroe County, North Carolina home, had stumbled upon a very rare antlered doe--a 1 in 10,000 phenomenon the occurs when a female deer has an overabundance of testosterone. 'It didn’t have the right private parts': Chuck Rorie killed what he thought was an 8-point trophy buck on Wednesday. When he skinned it, he realized it was actually a 1 in 10,000 antlered doe . 'I’m tickled to death. I know this is a once in a lifetime thing,' he told the Eagle. Rorie's kill was made especially rare by the high quality of the deer's antlers. More often than not, an antlered deer has an off-looking rack with lots of points growing in all directions. And more common than that, most antlered deer never lose the velvet that covers male antlers through the spring because they lack enough testosterone to drive them to rub off the covering. 'You could see tree bark on the antlers where she’d been rubbing them against trees, like a buck,' he said. Rorie told the Eagle that, at least at first blush, the deer looked like any normal buck as he lined up to shoot it at the edge of a hay field. It was with a group of other bucks that were chasing a group of does as potential mates. He didn't notice at the time that his deer lacked the necks swollen for mating season that the other bucks sported. The other does knew, though. '[It tried] to follow the does around, but they wanted nothing to do with her,' he said. 'I guess they saw the antlers and just assumed.' Doe or not, though, Rorie plans to mount the impressive rack like any other.","Chuck Rorie of Monroe, North Carolina was hunting with a friend in Kansas when he spotted what he thought was a trophy buck .

"The 'handmaiden' of a yoga master who horribly abused children was herself beaten by him and forced to drink his urine, an inquiry has been told. A royal commission into child sexual abuse at Mangrove Yoga Ashram on the NSW Central Coast has heard Shishy, who had legal guardianship of children at the retreat in the 1980s, was completely controlled by the spiritual leader Swami Akhandananda Saraswati. Former child residents at the ashram have given evidence she slapped them so hard it affected their hearing, eyesight and on one occasion the force slammed their heads against a wall. A royal commission into child sex abuse at Mangrove Yoga Ashram has heard Shishy (centre) - the partner of spiritual leader Swami  Akhandananda Saraswati - was forced to drink his urine for contraceptive reasons . Former child residents at the ashram have given evidence she slapped them so hard it affected their hearing, eyesight and on one occasion the force slammed their heads against a wall . On Monday she denied this but admitted she did slap children and brought young girls to the swami for sexual initiation, which she believed was for their 'spiritual growth'. Shishy was the partner of the Indian leader of the ashram, Swami Akhandananda Saraswati (above) On her second day in the witness stand Shishy, who was 14 when she met Akhandananda, said she believed the harsh treatment inflicted by the swami was for her own good. She went to live at the isolated Mangrove ashram with him when she was 18 and 'did what I was told to do'. 'Violent discipline was an acceptable part of ashram discipline meted out by the gurus. It was represented as an ""honour"" to receive slaps from the teacher/guru,' she said. Shishy now 57, was at the ashram until 1985 and during that time had two abortions - one self-administered. She had to drink Akhandananda's urine as part of a traditional contraceptive method, she told the commission. She also said Akhandananda sexually assaulted her with a double-barrelled shotgun and would punish her by digging out moles with a sharp pen knife. Two of the moles were quite deep and he would not let her get medical treatment so 'I stitched them myself with thin fishing wire', she told the commission . Akhandananda, who died in 1998, spent time in jail for molesting four girls. At one stage Shishy had guardianship of about seven children but said the papers were only signed to make sure child endowment payments came to the ashram. She also alleged the ashram created a directorship to fulfill requirements to become a charitable entity, adding 'there were no meetings or anything like that'. The Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse sitting in Sydney continues. Shishy was second-in-charge at the Satyananda Yoga Ashram on NSW's Central Coast during the 1970s and 1980s .

"A police dog named Copper has been credited for saving the life of a missing 6-year-old Utah boy who accidentally fell into an open manhole and became trapped underground. Kollin Bailey presented a large bone and a stocking full of doggie treats to his new four-legged friend on Saturday, a day after his ordeal in cold darkness about 10 feet below ground. 'He saved my life,' the boy told KUTV-TV, echoing his parents' belief. Scroll down for video... Kollin went missing from his Herriman home Friday evening.

Kollin Bailey's neighbors decorated his door with well wishes after he broke his arm falling in a manhol . After he was reported missing Friday afternoon, the 6-year-old bloodhound tracked his scent to the manhole in Kollin's hometown of Herriman, about 25 miles south of Salt Lake City. Police said the boy spent three to four hours there until he was located Friday night. An officer then descended the hole to lift him out. 'I was really scared ... I thought I was going to miss Christmas,' Kollin said. Kollin, who suffered a broken arm and mild concussion, said he was flying a kite when he tripped and fell into the manhole.

By Saturday morning, Kollin and his family had gone through an emotional 24 hours. 'I was flying my kite, and I think I saw a rock and I think I tripped over it and fell into the hole', Kollin said . Kollin’s mother, Shara Bailey, said they began looking for him. She said she was afraid for her child. 'I had thought the worst, you know? You always wonder how do people go to sleep at night without their babies home? And I was terrified I was going to have to,' she said . Today the family is just thankful, for the efforts and kindness of their neighborhood, that their child was found and only suffered a broken arm. They said they are especially grateful for Copper and Sgt Matheson . Kollin’s time in the hole probably lasted three to four hours. A police officer jumped down the hole and lifted the boy up to other officers . When Kollin first hugged his mom after being rescued from the hole, she said he was most concerned about missing Christmas .","Kollin Bailey, 6, was flying his kite when he fell down an open manhole cover .

"A schoolboy who was stabbed to death during a late-night row has been named as a talented footballer. Joel Adesina, 15, collapsed in Bethnal Green, in East London, on Friday night after being knifed in the stomach. He was taken to hospital but died three hours later. His mother was last night being comforted by family members who were said to be in shock. Joel Adesina, 15, (pictured) was stabbed in Bethnal Green, in East London, on Friday night and later died . Joel’s neighbours in Dagenham described him as an ambitious schoolboy who came from a hard-working family. They said he never stayed out late and would be seen coming home in his football kit. The manager of Joel’s football team said the winger was ‘as good as gold’ and talented enough to play professionally. Ricky Downes, the manager of Bardag FC Yellows, said: ‘To say that myself and the club are devastated is an understatement, we are absolutely in bits. ‘Joel was a wonderful young lad who had the world at his feet. ‘He was a very talented footballer and had ambitions of playing professionally. I think he had a future in the sport and could have played for a living. Police pictured on Saturday at Bethnal Green Road in London where Joel Adesina was stabbed . The 54-year-old added: ‘There was something about Joel that touched me and his death is totally unexpected. He never gave me any inkling that he was involved in gangs or anything like that. ‘He was cheeky, bubbly, and a thoroughly likeable young man.’ Police said the teenager from Dagenham was walking with friends when they were confronted by a group in a parked car. The group were pursued into a housing estate where neighbours heard ‘screaming and shouting’. Joel was cornered and stabbed. A Scotland Yard spokesperson said: ‘Police were called by London Ambulance Service to Bethnal Green Road, E2, at 23:04hrs on Friday, 5 December. ‘Officers attended and found a 15-year-old boy suffering from serious stab injuries to the abdomen. ‘The boy was taken by London Ambulance Service to an east London hospital.

"Qantas has had their third emergency landing in a day, with a Qantas flight from Sydney to Dallas forced to return to Sydney airport during what has become a day of chaos for Australia’s national airline. Flight QF7 was turned back four hours into its journey due to a ‘technical issue’ which affected power to seats, in-flight entertainment and some toilets on board. The flight landed at Sydney airport at 10.30pm and Qantas is ensuring passengers have accommodation for the evening . The airline insists that the problem was 'non-safety related' and the decision was purely a matter of 'customer comfort.' The latest mid-air turnaround is the third Qantas aircraft to be forced to land on Monday after two aircrafts were both forced to land at Perth Airport in separate incidents. In the early hours of the morning, a Dubai-to-Sydney flight was forced to land when air pressure in the cabin suddenly dropped, whilst in the afternoon a domestic Qantas flight was turned back to Perth  due to a 'strange odour' in the cabin. The disasterous day began when Qantas CEO Alan Joyce announced a $550 million improvement on the airline's finances. It had appeared Qantas' fortune was turning around as shares had increased by 14 per cent. But the good luck quickly ended when flights began to turn around instead. Scroll down for video . A second Qantas flight (stock image used) has been forced to make an emergency landing at Perth Airport, due to reports of smoke and 'an unusual aroma' in the cabin . While the Qantas spokeswoman said there were 'no reports of any passengers affected', a St John Ambulance spokesman said paramedics were treating 75 people at the airport for smoke inhalation . Travellers took to social media to complain about their flight malfunction, explaining that '400 people at 11pm were being processed by two staff members' as they waited for luggage . 'While the aircraft could have continued flying safely to Dallas, the decision was made to return to Sydney in the interests of passenger comfort on what is a long flight,' a Qantas statement read. 'We've sincerely apologised to our customers for their patience and understanding for what was a frustrating experience.' They assure customers that they will eventually reach their destination safely. 'Customers who don't live in Sydney have been put up in hotels for the night and all others given transport home. 'We’ve rebooked customers on another flight to Dallas leaving tomorrow morning.' Both flights which with unscheduled landings on Monday were grounded at Perth Airport (pictured) It had begun as a positive day for Qantas when CEO Alan Joyce announced a half-year profit of between $300 and $350 million . The Dallas to Sydney route is the world's longest flight route and has only been running for two months. It is a non-stop trip that lasts just under 16 hours. The latest mid-air turnaround is the third Qantas aircraft to be forced to land on Monday. It comes just hours after a domestic flight was turned back to Perth when ‘strange odours’ were smelt in the cabin of Karratha-bound flight QF904. A spokeswoman for Perth Airport said a warning system had also lit up. However, passengers began to complain that they felt unwell and were attended to by paramedics after they safely disembarked the vessel at 3pm, according to ABC News. Up to 80 people were 'assessed for smoke inhalation at Perth Airport', according to a St John Ambulance spokesperson. It was confirmed that all patients, which included pilots and passengers, were cleared and no transportation was required. It's claimed the first grounded plane dropped from 39,000 feet to 9000 feet in just minutes . A Qantas spokeswoman insisted that smoke inhalation would have been impossible as there was no smoke in the cabin at any point . Passenger David Robertson explained that everyone on the flight remained calm after a smell similar to kerosene or 'a dry-cleaning smell' was detected, ABC News reports. 'They just made the announcement that (there was a) strange smell around row five or six, and they're just turned it back for precautionary reasons,' he told ABC. 'Qantas flight QF 904 from Perth to Karatha did an air return at 2.40pm Perth time today following reports by cabin crew of an unusual odour in the cabin,' a spokesperson told Daily Mail Australia. 'The flight landed normally with emergency services on standby as a precaution.' 'The 737 aircraft will undergo an engineering inspection to try and locate the source of the odour.' Passengers were moved to a later Qantas flight. The aircraft is  being investigated by engineers and Qantas personnel. The incident with Flight QF904 was just hours after a Qantas airbus was grounded at the same airport, due to 'a drop in air pressure in the cabin'. Passengers on the plane, travelling from Dubai to Sydney, experienced a dramatic descent into Perth Airport in the early hours of Monday morning. The aircraft experienced technical issues, when reportedly air pressure in the cabin dropped and the plane’s air conditioning unit malfunctioned. Passengers appeared calm as they waited on the tarmac in Perth after the first Qantas incident . A Qantas passenger has documented his terrifying emergency landing experience after the huge double-deck airbus plane was forced to abandon its path when its cabin lost air pressure. The QF2 flight reportedly dropped from 39,000 feet to 9,000 feet in just minutes on its way from Dubai to Sydney. Traveller Nigel Richardson, from Melbourne, documented the dramatic landing on Twitter, and reported those on board were told: ‘Cabin crew this is an emergency descent. The aircraft is in full control’. He commented it was 'sort of a good news / bad news thing.’ ‘Fastest descent I've ever experienced in a plane. Always interesting when you see cabin crew running too,’ he added. ‘Air conditioning problem. Aircraft not in danger. Crew very calm and professional,’ he said, before later being told by staff that the air con was not the problem and they would need to leave the plane at Perth. Live tweeting the terrifying experience, the frequent flyer joked: ‘Look on the bright side. I've never been to Perth before. Unplanned stopover. How long we are here for – TBD.’ Courtney Atkinson tweeted a picture of the flight path and called it an 'interesting start to the day' after the plane dropped in just 'four minutes' Frequent flyer Nigel Richardson was woken up by the plane's quick descent . He kept his Twitter followers updated with the situation and said there was 'full show down of air conditioning system' Mr Richardson joked he had never been to Perth before . ‘Full shut down of air conditioning system that keeps plane pressurised at altitude was the problem,’ he clarified. He said despite the oxygen masks not dropping the incident ‘seemed to scare the crews as much as us’. As the giant plane waited on the tarmac at Perth airport for a decision to be made on what to do next, Mr Richardson tweeted a photo from inside the cabin of people calmly reaching into the overhead lockers, talking and reading on their Kindles and laptops. After first being told an air conditioning problem was at fault, he then said: ‘Air con fault not identified. Expect that ground crew need to talk to Airbus to resolve. Decision to de-plane...’ The passenger said the Qantas crew were 'very calm and professional' Another passenger said the pilot was keeping them informed . Mr Richardson was later told the air con was not at fault . Fellow passenger Gabriella Southwell said that after the plane had made its emergency landing a pilot walking down the aisle ‘keeping people informed’. The AirLive website reported that the A380 was 'circling to burn/dump fuel before landing to Perth'. A Qantas spokesperson told Daily Mail Australia: 'Qantas Flight QF2 travelling from Dubai to Sydney diverted to Perth due to a fault with the air conditioning. The fault occurred about 1 hour from Perth. 'As a precaution the aircraft descended to 10,000 feet and the Captain requested a priority landing . 'The aircraft landed safely and was inspected by engineers. 'As the crew reached their maximum duty limits before the issue could be fixed on the ground, customers have been provided with overnight accommodation and will be booked on the next available services today to their destination.'","Qantas has had three emergency landings in one day .

"The champagne is still fresh on his face but newly crowned V8's greatest ever driver Jamie Whincup is already feeling paranoid about bettering his own record of six Supercar titles next year. The Holden superstar officially cemented his place as the most successful driver in Australian touring car history when he was crowned 2014 champion in Sydney on Sunday night. He said: 'I'm in the position now where I've been the last three years, thinking that it's been a great year but with a little bit of paranoia about how we're going to back this up. Jamie, driver of the #1 Red Bull Racing Australia Holden, celebrates winning the 2014 V8 Supercar Championship trophy . 'How are we going to go one better than what we've done this year? ' Jamie, 31, started the season-ending Sydney 500 with an unassailable lead, yet still managed to pull two wins from three races in extraordinary circumstances. The closing 250km feature was abandoned with 29 laps to go after a storm of torrential rain and golf ball-sized hail lashed Sydney Olympic Park, turning parts of the street circuit into a wild river. Going hard: The six-times championship spent Sunday night celebrating his success with friends and famiy . It was almost a carbon copy of Saturday's 125km race, which also had to be suspended amid torrential rain. Shane van Gisbergen was declared the final race winner after taking the lead just before the safety car intervened, securing him the season's runner-up trophy. Ford's Mark Winterbottom, who led the championship for several rounds earlier in the year, ended up third overall after his 19th-placing with veteran Craig Lowndes fourth. Jamie celebrates winning the 2013 championship after finishing third in the Sydney 500 . 'It was a bit of a weird end to what's been one of the best V8 Supercar championships of all time,' added Whincup, who finished the race fourth and 586 points in front on the driver's standings. 'I know this moment won't last forever, but I'm in a very critical and amazing part of my life - which could be the best part of my life, I'm not sure. 'But I'll come out again next year and try to do what I've done the last three years and keep backing up and ride this massive roller coaster as long as I can.' Former printing assistant Jamie now stands alone as the winner of most titles in the 54-year history of Australian touring car/V8 Supercars championships and also has four Bathurst 1000 titles. He also won the V8 Supercars Championship in 2011, left, and in 2012 when he was #1 Team Vodafone Holden . He won the title in 2008, 2009, 2011, 2012, 2013 and now in 2014, surpassing greats Mark Skaife, Dick Johnson and the late Ian Geoghegan, who all collected five trophies. And he equals Geoghegan's record for most successive championships with four. So how does 2014 stack up in the championship stakes? 'It's like your kids - you don't have any favourites, they're all good in their own way,' he jokes. 'I don't have any kids - not that I know of anyway - but that's probably the best way to sum up these championships. Left, Jamie celebrates winning the round after race three of round four of the V8 Supercar Championship Series  in 2007 and right, he holds aloft the Championship trophy after winning the 2008 competition . 'Right now, this one feels bigger, better and more important than any other - but that's just because I'm in the moment.' Jamie said both he and Red Bull Racing were very good at bottling up their emotions, but was planning to celebrate big with the team and family on Sunday night. 'You bottle all that emotion until moments like these, where you reflect on what the year's been and certainly all the good things that have happened,' he said.

"A 10-year-old boy with learning difficulties died after getting caught in a curtain cord at his family's home home. An ambulance crew and a rapid response paramedic raced to the semi-detached home after receiving a 999 call reporting that he had stopped breathing. He was given CPR and taken under police escort to hospital, where he was  unable to be saved and was certified dead. The boy was taken to St Mary's Hospital in the Isle of Wight (pictured) but was unable to be saved . A police spokesman said: 'Police can confirm that they were called to an address in Ryde, Isle of Wight, at about 3pm on Sunday. 'A 10-year-old boy was taken from the address to St Mary's Hospital on the Isle of Wight, where the boy later died.' The boy's mother, Jodie Tuckey, 32, a mother-of-two said she was too distraught to talk. Neighbour Sally Woods, 64, a retired support worker, said: 'When I got home there were three police cars parked outside the house. 'I used to see the boy at the bus stop down the road after he got dropped off by the special bus. 'His mum used to pick him up from the bus stop and she would always say hello. 'It is such tragic news. Whenever I saw him he was always smiling, he was always happy.' The boy was not breathing when paramedics arrived at his home. Isle of Wight Ambulance Service received the 999 call on Sunday afternoon and an ambulance arrived at the scene at 2.47pm. An Isle of Wight NHS Trust spokesman said: 'We received a 999 call during the afternoon of Sunday, December 7, in which the caller indicated that a young boy was not breathing. 'The Ambulance Service despatched a 999 emergency ambulance which was on the scene at Binstead at 2.47pm, a rapid response vehicle which arrived at the scene at 2.49pm, and an officer was on scene at 2.50pm.

"German airline Lufthansa will soon allow its passengers to travel with falcons, the company has announced. From late next year, travellers will be able to take their hunting birds onboard in a newly-designed device called the ‘Falcon Master’ tray, which can be fitted with a cage. The move is set to prove popular with the airline’s Middle East customers, where falconry is hugely popular. Scroll down for video . The 'Falcon Master' enables owners to transport their falcons or other birds in the aircraft sitting on a dedicated bird stand connected to standard seat tracks. It comes with a cage and transparent cover . German airline Lufthansa will soon allow its passengers to travel with falcons, the company has announced . The United Arab Emirates runs wild falcon conservation projects as well as breeding farms and veterinary hospitals for the animals. For centuries hunting with falcons was a major source of meat in the harsh desert region, and the birds remain a national emblem, found on everything from corporate logos to banknotes. But with wildlife under pressure, hunting has been restricted, and many affluent Emiratis now travel abroad to locations as far as Morocco, Pakistan and Central Asia. ‘Falconry is very popular in many countries of the Middle East, and the Falcon Master, developed by VIP & Executive Jet Solutions, allows the owner to take their falcons or other birds in the cabin with them,’ said the airline's technology division, Lufthansa Technik. The United Arab Emirates runs wild falcon conservation projects as well as breeding farms and veterinary hospitals for the animals . The move is set to prove popular with the airline’s Middle East customers, where falconry is hugely popular . The device is now in the design phase, and the certification process would likely take six to nine months before it is ready for use,’ a Lufthansa spokesman said. The special stand is adjustable in height, width and depth and can be installed on a seat of all of Lufthansa's Airbus, Boeing and other aircraft types. Falcons are currently permitted on a number of Middle Eastern airlines including Abu Dhabi-based Etihad. The birds wear hoods and are usually tethered to the passenger's glove to prevent them from flying around the cabin. Abu Dhabi-based Etihad airline says on its website that ‘we accept the carriage of falcons in the main aircraft cabin provided that all the necessary documents have been obtained. We also accept falcons as checked baggage.’ From late next year, travellers will be able to take their hunting birds onboard in a newly-designed device called the ‘Falcon Master’ tray, which can be fitted with a cage . Royal Jordanian also states that ‘falcons may be carried in the cabin’ on many flights, provided they are ‘properly hooded’, adding that ‘a chain or rope must be securely attached to the aircraft seat and the leg of each bird’. Lufthansa said it had designed the bird-transport devices ‘in close cooperation with falcon experts from the Middle East’. ‘The Falcon Master ensures maximum hygienic protection of the cabin walls, seats and carpets from soiling by the birds,’ Lufthansa said a statement. The platform can be quickly disassembled in three parts and stowed in lightweight containers which can be transported like a trolley. The majority of airlines currently allow passengers to travel with domesticated pets such as small cats and dogs in the cabin. Falcons are currently permitted on a number of Middle Eastern airlines including Abu Dhabi-based Etihad . A handful of airlines including Finnair, United Airlines and Alaska Airlines also allow animals such as rabbits, guinea pigs and hamsters in the cabin. Air Europa allows its customers to travel in the cabin with fish, tortoises and some rodents, while other pets accepted as hold luggage. Flights arriving in the UK allow domestic animals to enter the country providing they meet the entry requirements of a microchip, blood tests and rabies vaccinations.","Travellers will be able to take the birds of prey onboard from late next year .

"A German court has sensationally thrown out a case against a former Nazi SS member accused of taking part in the massacre of hundreds of French villagers during the Second World War. Werner Christukat, 89, had been accused of being a member of an armoured SS division that attacked Oradour-sur-Glane on June 10, 1944 - savagely murdering nearly all of its inhabitants. But the case against the elderly suspect - who had been charged in January with the murder of 25 people committed by a group, and with aiding and abetting the murder of several hundred others - was dramatically dismissed this morning for lack of evidence. Christukat, who lives in Cologne, said he is haunted by the massacre of 642 civilians - and although he admitted being in the village with his S.S. regiment on the day, denied ever killing anybody. Scroll down for video . Horror: Today Oradour exists as a massive memorial - a chilling time capsule where the burned out homes remain exactly as they were on the day they were torched . Abandoned: The village has been a ghost town since the massacre, with rusting cars (left) nestled beside the rubble of Oradour-sur-Glane's burned-out church (right) The suspected former Nazi's case was being heard in the western German city of Cologne, but a statement released by the court this morning revealed it no longer intended to pursue the case. Charges against Christukat, who was 19 at the time of the atrocity, were initially filed by the prosecutor's office in Dortmund. Had he been convicted, it is almost certain Christukat would have spent the rest of his life in jail. The massacre the man had been accused of taking part in took place in the tiny village of Oradour-sur-Glane in western France on June 10, 1944. It is understood to have been a brutal act of retribution following the purported kidnapping of a Nazi commander. SS members stormed a barn where 181 men had gathered, using pistols and automatic weapons to murder them all before setting fire to the structure. They are believed to have then moved on to a church where a further 254 women and 207 children were killed using explosives and machine guns. Christukat, 89, was accused of being a member of an armoured Nazi SS division that attacked Oradour-sur-Glane on June 10, 1944 - savagely murdering nearly all of the its inhabitants . Remains of homes in Oradour -sur-Glane, where inhabitants were massacred and all homes and businesses destroyed by Nazis 70 years ago . Christukat says he has had nightmares about the massacre ever since it took place - particularly over one small boy whose life he was unable to save. 'There was this boy,' he said. 'He came walking over the hill. A small blonde boy with a bicycle and he wanted to go past me and into the village. I can still picture it exactly.' 'I stopped him and wanted to chase him away, but then the junior squad leader came up and started yelling at me.' 'Not a night goes by in which I don't think of Oradour. In front of me, I can still see the church through the treetops. I hear a bang and then the screaming of women and children.' 'I can't get it out of my mind. I felt so dreadfully sorry for them. But the worst is that I couldn't save the boy.' Last September German president Joachim Gauck (left) became the first German leader to visit the site when he joined François Hollande (right) and two of the three living survivors on a tour of Oradour-sur-Glane. Memories: Hollande and Gauck were accompanied by two of only three living survivors of the Oradour massacre - Robert Hebras, 88, and Jean-Marcel Darthout. Prosecutors had accused Christukat of helping the massacre take place by either blocking off or acting as a lookout along the road leading to the church, or by carrying flammable material to help burn the building down once the murders had been carried out. The suspect, who admitted being in Oradour-sur-Glane at the time and confirmed his involvement with the local SS branch, has always denied having anything to do with the massacre of 642 people. The village has been a ghost town since the massacre, with rusting cars nestled long-abandoned beside the rubble of the burned-out church. Today Oradour exists as a massive memorial - a chilling time capsule where the burned out homes remain exactly as they were on the day they were torched, and even the car of the mayor still lies rusting in the main street. Location: Oradour-sur-Glane is in central France, approximately 250 miles south of the capital Paris . German soldiers killed all 642 inhabitants, including children. The men were rounded up and shot in barns, the women were herded into the local church which was set ablaze with hand grenades . Homes and business were all torched by rampaging S.S officers, leaving just empty shells remaining . The atrocity is an understandably sensitive subjective for France, and last September German president Joachim Gauck became the first German leader to visit the site when he joined François Hollande and two of the three living survivors on a tour of Oradour-sur-Glane. In a sign of post-war unity,  Gauck said he felt a 'mixture of gratitude and humility' as he visited the site with his French counterpart Hollande. The statesman added: 'The Germany that I have the honour of representing is a different Germany from the one that haunts memories.' In return, Mr Hollande said: 'You have made the choice to visit - this is a tribute to you, and at the same time it forces us, once the past has been acknowledged, to go boldly into the future.' Hollande and Gauck were accompanied by two of only three living survivors of the Oradour massacre - Robert Hebras, 88, and Jean-Marcel Darthout. Rubble: Survivors look for the bodies of victims within the remains of the village shortly after the massacre . Destroyed: A burned out building is seen in Oradour-sur-Glane just days after the atrocity took place . The exterior of the Church in Oradour-sur-Glane. Only six villagers survived the attack . A military tribunal opened in Bordeaux in 1953 to try the surviving 65 of the approximately 200 soldiers involved in the massacre. However, many could not be extradited from the new East Germany, and 14 of them were Alsatians - French nationals of German extraction. 20 men were found guilty, but were all released from prison within five years. In 2010, Germany re-opened the war crimes file into the massacre after a historian uncovered evidence implicating several still-living suspects. Using secret files on individuals created by communist East Germany's Stasi secret police force, prosecutors identified seven previously unknown members of the SS unit that carried the attack. Investigations are now underway into six of the men. The other suspect is Christukat, against whom charges were dropped today. Early on the morning of 10 June 1944, the 2nd SS Panzer Division entered the village of Oradour-sur-Glane to avenge the death of a German officer who had been kidnapped by the French Resistance. They marched into the town and separated the men from the women and children. The men were taken to six barns and shed while the women and children were locked in the church while the village was looted. Devastated: Oradour-sur-Glane is seen just days after the massacre on June 10, 1944 . The men were said to be shot in the legs before being doused in petrol and set alight. Six men escaped although one was later found nearby and shot dead. In total 190 men perished. The soldiers proceeded to the church and tried to set it alight. Women and children tried to escape through the doors and windows of the church, but were met with machine-gun fire. A total of 247 women and 205 children died. Two women and one child survived; one was 47-year-old Marguerite Rouffanche. She hauled herself out of a window behind the altar, followed by a young woman and child. German soldiers shot all three of them, killing the woman and child by wounding Rouffanche who escaped into nearby foliage where she stayed until she was rescued the following day. The following is part of her testimony read out to the 1953 Bordeaux military tribunal: . 'Firing burst out in the church then straw, faggots and chairs were thrown pele-mele onto bodies lying on the stone slabs. I had escaped from the killing and was without injury so I made use of a smoke cloud to slip behind the altar. In this part of the church there are three windows. I made for the widest one in the middle and with the help of a stool used to light the candles, I tried to reach it. I don't know how but my strength was multiplied. I heaved myself up to it as best I could and threw myself out of the opening that was offered to me through the already shattered window. I jumped about nine feet down. 'When I looked up I saw I had been followed in my climb by a woman holding out her baby to me. She fell down next to me but the Germans, alerted by the cries of the baby, machine-gunned us. The woman and the mite were killed and I too was injured as I made it to a neighbouring garden and hid among some rows of peas and waited anxiously for someone to come to help me. That wasn't until the following day at 5 p.m.'","Werner Christukat, 89, had been accused of murder in Oradour-sur-Glane .

"A new comic book has launched in India that features a female gang-rape survivor ‘super hero’ who conquers her attackers on the back of a tiger – and its creators hope it will help reduce the number of gender crimes in the country. Called Priya’s Shakti, its heroine, Priya, battles sexual violence in India with the help of Goddess Parvati. Creator Ram Devineni wanted to focus the nation’s attention on the difficulty rape victims in India have in bringing their attackers to justice. Fighting back: Priya is an Indian comic book hero who conquers her attackers on the back of a tiger . Unique: Priya is the star of Priya’s Shakti, a comic that is free to download . Ninety-three women are raped every day in India, according to official statistics . The co-creator of the comic was spurred on by the brutal fatal rape of a 23-year-old on a bus in Delhi . Very often it’s they, and not the rapists, who become hated by society with many people blaming them for what’s happened. Mr Devineni told the BBC: ‘I spoke to some gang-rape survivors and they said they were discouraged by their families and communities to seek justice, they were also threatened by the rapists and their families. Even the police didn't take them seriously.’ Such attitudes have led to horrific levels of sexual violence in the country, with 93 women raped every day, according to the National Crime Records Bureau. One of the most shocking recent cases was the brutal gang rape and murder of a 23-year-old on a moving bus in Delhi in 2012. It was this that spurred Mr Devineni on to help create the comic. He said: ‘I was in Delhi at the time when the protests broke out and I was involved in some of them. I was talking to a police officer when he said something that I found very surprising. He said “no good girl walks alone at night”. ‘That's where the idea began. I realised that rape and sexual violence in India was a cultural issue, and that it was backed by patriarchy, misogyny and people's perceptions.’ Priya, battles sexual violence in India with the help of Goddess Parvati . The launch of the comic follows the news that New Delhi has banned the ride-sharing service Uber from the city after a woman was allegedly raped by one of its drivers . To help publicize the project Mr Devineni commissioned Bollywood poster painters and street artists to paint Priya’s Shakti-themed murals in a Mumbai slum . The comic's creators hope it will help reduce the number of gender crimes in the country . In the comic, which will be free to download at www.priyashakti.com, Priya eventually rides back into her home town, from which she was banished by her parents, on the back of a tiger and conquers her attackers. To help publicize the project Mr Devineni commissioned Bollywood poster painters and street artists to paint Priya’s Shakti-themed murals in a Mumbai slum. The launch of the comic follows the news that New Delhi has banned the ride-sharing service Uber from the city after a woman was allegedly raped by one of its drivers. Police said they were considering legal action against Uber for failing to run background checks after it emerged the suspect, Shiv Kumar Yadav, 32, was arrested for raping a woman three years ago but was later acquitted. The comic is premiering at the Mumbai Film and Comics Convention from December 19 to 21.","New comic Priya’s Shakti features a female rape survivor ‘super hero’

"Cho Hyun-ah, an executive VP at Korean Air Lines and the chairman's eldest daughter, has resigned after causing an on board fracas over nuts . A top executive of Korean Air Lines resigned on Tuesday amid mounting public criticism that she delayed a plane over how she was served macadamia nuts. Company officials said that Chairman Cho Yang-ho has accepted the resignation of Cho Hyun-ah, his eldest daughter and an executive vice president. The junior Cho came under public fire following revelations that a recent Korean Air Lines flight from New York to South Korea returned to the gate because she ordered a senior crew member off the plane. Cho was angered that she was served bagged macadamia nuts instead of nuts on a plate. The airline had apologized for inconveniencing passengers. But it also said it was 'natural' for Cho to fault crew's ignorance of procedures. Flight KE086’s to Incheon Airport, close to Seoul, was delayed by 11 minutes due to the incident. Ms Cho, who is also known by her English name Heather, was also reportedly facing up to ten years in prison over the fracas. South Korea's Transport Ministry announced on Monday that they are investigating if Cho violated the Aviation Safety Law, which states that passengers should not cause disturbances, including using violent language or yelling, for safety reasons. Flight 86 was already on the runway for its 12.50am departure from JFK when Ms Cho lost her temper after an unidentified worker placed some macadamia nuts in front of her as she sat in first class, reports the Korean Times. The junior flight attendant's faux pas was to serve the nuts inside the bag that they came in rather than presenting them on a small dish - as is protocol. Scroll down for video . Korean Air Flight 86 was already on the runway for its 12.50am departure from JFK when Cho lost her temper after an unidentified worker broke protocol and placed the snack of macadamia nuts in front of her as she sat in first class . Cho Hyun-ah (pictured right with South Korean pop star Rain) has resigned from Korean Air Lines after she forced a plane back to the gate at JFK to remove a crew member who served her nuts incorrectly . Ms Cho screamed at the attendant and told him to bring out the company's in-flight service manual so he could read the proper nut-handling guidelines. When he failed to find it, Cho lost her cool and ordered him off the flight. 'The chief flight attendant failed to get the right manual, and this led Cho to believe he was not qualified for that job,' a Korean Air official told the Korean Times. Without giving the 250 passengers on board a warning, the pilots decided to give in to her demands and return to the airport to drop off the attendant. As their investigation gets underway, the Transport Ministry must try to figure out if Cho's behavior warrants a prison sentence. 'We'll see whether her behavior was against the law,' a ministry official told the Korean Times. 'It is an unprecedented case, so we need to see the related regulations.' 'Even though she is senior vice president at the company, she was a passenger at that time, so she had to behave and be treated as a passenger,' they added. 'She could have taken other measures after coming back to Korea, such as strengthening service training.'

"He hasn't had the easiest year defending his economic record and actions on immigration. And a playful appearance on The Colbert Report brought no light relief for President Obama. Amid jokes about his approval ratings and big ears, he could not escape a grilling about his move to protect five million immigrants from deportation without Congress approval. Host Stephen Colbert, who is known for scolding his interviewees, accused Obama of exceeding his authority with his executive order. 'When did you decide to burn the Constitution and become emperor?' he asked. Scroll down for video . Playful appearance: President Obama told Stephen Colbert his family tease him about his big ears and suits . The question was heard as a joke by many in the audience at George Washington University. But to Obama's critics, the question had a ring of truth. Obama dropped the comedy and replied: 'Actually, Steve, everything that we have done is scrupulously within the law and has been done by previous Democratic and Republican presidents.' The tongue-in-cheek question came at the close of a playful interview, in which the President revealed his family make sure power doesn't go to his head. His daughters mock his big ears and his stuffy suits, and he leaves his socks on the floor, he told Colbert. In fact, he said, he feels much more important sitting behind the revered chat show host's desk. 'When I go home, Michelle, Malia and Sasha give me a hard time. There are no trumpets, and they tease me mercilessly.' His comments came on the special DC edition of the show. Colbert also addressed his delayed decision on the Keystone XL oil pipeline, chiding that it should run into Mexico and around the world. Skit: Posing as Colbert, the President joked about his poor approval ratings and lack of support for Obamacare . Regular: It is Obama's third appearance on the show - his second since taking office in 2009 . Moving on: The show, filmed in Washington, DC, was one of Colbert's last as he prepares to move to CBS . It was Obama's third appearance on the show, his second as president, and marked the beginning of the final two weeks for the Comedy Central show. Colbert will take over for David Letterman on CBS' 'Late Show' next year. Obama kicked off the show sitting in for Colbert to perform a regular feature of the program called 'the Word' wherein Colbert's rants are accompanied by snarky messages to the audience. So when Obama, as Colbert, declared that there are aspects of 'Obamacare' that people from both parties actually like, the text aside to the audience read: 'Everything but the Obama.' Later, Colbert observed that the economy had been creating more jobs of late. 'Emperor': The pair laughed about Obama's used of an executive order to protect immigrants from deportation . Debate: Colbert, who is known for scolding his interviewees, gave his views on the Keystone pipeline . 'You have employed a lot of people - mostly as secretary of defense,' Colbert cracked in a reference to Obama recently nominating his fourth top civilian at the Pentagon. 'That's boosted our numbers a little bit,' Obama replied. As he wrapped up, Colbert had one last question: 'Barack Obama - great president or the greatest president?' 'I'm going to let someone else decide - not you, but someone who knows what they're talking about,' the president replied. Colbert countered: 'Stephen Colbert - great pundit or the greatest pundit?' Obama didn't miss a beat: 'The greatest pundit.'","President Obama appeared on one of Stephen Colbert's last shows .

"Shrien Dewani's account of key issues at the heart of the prosecution case against him has changed over the four years since his wife's murder in South African and his trial (above) The story Shrien Dewani gave to his in-laws about the night his new bride was murdered four years ago is at odds with what his South African trial has heard in recent weeks. A plea explanation, which was read out in court by his lawyer, was dismissed by the detective who made the case against Dewani in court as 'a newly-fabricated story'. In the 37-page document, read out by his lawyer at the start of his trial, Dewani provided his first justification for CCTV footage and phone records which revealed he met privately with Zola Tongo, the taxi driver who accused the businessman of ordering the murder of his wife. Their two meetings - totalling almost an hour together alone - plus a string of text messages and calls in the 24 hours leading up to the murder of Anni, 28, were not mentioned by Dewani in interviews with four police officers or at the two-hour meeting with his family. The new statement also sees Dewani admitting for the first time to carrying a large sum of cash in the car on the night the honeymooners were ambushed by gunmen – and an 'alibi' for having it. However, comparing his stories told soon after the dramatic killing of his wife and his recent recollection, the businessman's story becomes vague on essential details - such as how he was freed from Tongo's taxi before his wife was driven off to her death. Dewani, 34, was accused of plotting with cab driver Zola Tongo, Mziwamadoda Qwabe and gunman Xolile Mngeni to kill Anni while they were on their honeymoon in Cape Town in November 2010. He denies all charges including kidnapping, murder and defeating the ends of justice. Here, MailOnline has compared his two accounts given four years apart to highlight the variations on the key issues at the heart of the prosecution case against him. Taxi driver Zola Tongo (above) was sentenced to 18 years for his part in arranging the honeymoon murder . CONTACT WITH TONGO: . CCTV footage seized by police from the Cape Grace hotel and Dewani's and Tongo's phone records revealed the two men had met alone twice – for 13 minutes and 45 minutes – in the 24 hours before Anni's murder. In addition, during the same period they exchanged 12 phone communications - calls and text messages. Security film also shows the two men talking alone together at the hotel on the morning after the carjacking and two days later, on the day Dewani leaves South Africa, when and leads the driver down a hotel corridor to a quiet business centre where he hands over a bag containing cash. 2010: In the transcript of the two-hour family crisis talks, Dewani specifically denies meeting or having any contact with Tongo between the time the driver dropped the honeymooners off at their five-star hotel and 24 hours later to take them out for dinner, apart from a brief call or message to make that arrangement. Dewani makes no mention of meeting Tongo in the hours before the fatal carjacking, on 13 November 2010, or two more rendezvous at his hotel in the days after. Caught on CCTV: In one video clip shown to the courtroom, Dewani is captured leading alleged fixer Tongo down a hotel corridor to a quiet room, carrying a small bag . In the meeting's record, Preyen asks his brother about Friday 12 November, the day before the murder, when Tongo dropped the couple at their hotel. Dewani fails to mention that after checking in, he went back outside to talk alone with Tongo in his car. Preyen: 'So this guy, you haven't spoken to him again that night [Friday?] . Shrien: No, uh uh, he left us when he dropped us at six and that was it. Shrien confirms he contacted Tongo by phone 'at lunchtime' on the day of the murder to arrange for him to pick them up that evening and drive them to a restaurant. Preyen, apparently trying to work out if Tongo had sufficient time to plan the carjacking, asks: 'So the earliest he knew he was going to be used by you was lunchtime?' Shrien: 'Yes, or just before.' 2014: In his plea explanation to the court, Dewani admits to the two private meetings with Tongo in the 24 hours before his wife's death and exchanging text messages and calls. The contact was necessary and private, his explanation says, as Tongo was organising a helicopter ride on behalf of Dewani as a surprise honeymoon treat for Anni. The cost of the trip was R15,000 – exactly the same sum of money that Tongo told the court Dewani was prepared to pay for the contract killing of his wife. Evidence: The opening shot of the surveillance camera sequence shown to the South African court shows suspect Shrien Dewani walking through the foyer of the Cape Grace hotel days after his new wife's murder . Follow me: Dewani leads the way as he takes the cab driver to a part of the hotel not covered by CCTV . BUNDLES OF CASH: . 2010: In his account to Anni's family shortly after her funeral, Dewani makes no mention of any significant sums of cash he had on him at the time of the armed ambush. In the transcript, he recalls handing over an unspecified amount of money that was in his left trouser pocket, along with valuables such as his phone and designer watch. He makes no reference to any money in his wife's bag, which was stolen by the two armed robbers. 'I think she gave him the handbag because the phone was in the handbag,' he says during the meeting. 2014: Four years later, Dewani informed the court, via Francois van Zyl, his senior barrister, that a significant sum of cash was being carried by the couple on the night of the murder. Prosecutors allege the bundle of notes – R10,000, around £850 at the exchange rate of the time - which he had put in his wife's bag, plus R5,000 (£425) more in his pockets, was payment for his wife's killers. 'I took the R10,000 I had exchanged in order to pay a deposit [for the helicopter ride]… I asked Anni to put the money in her handbag. 'I also had about R4,000 in my pocket to pay for dinner, and the taxi fare of R1,000 previously agreed,' the statement read. The bundles of cash - fortunes in poverty-stricken South Africa - or what they were intended for, were not disclosed to any of the four policemen who interviewed Dewani in the hours and days after his wife's fatal shooting. Captain Paul Hendrickse, the senior detective who became suspicious of Dewani a day after his wife's sudden death, said the first he knew about the cash or the helicopter was on the opening day of the businessman's trial, eight weeks ago. Knowledge of the money would have immediately made Tongo a prime suspect and changed the course of the murder investigation, the detective told the Western Cape High Court. Middle man and trigger man: Mziwamadoda Qwabe (left) was sentenced to 25 years in prison for his part as a go-between in the plot to kill Mrs Dewani, while Xolile Mngeni (right) was convicted of firing the fatal shots . HOW DEWANI WAS FREED BY HIS WIFE'S KILLERS: . 2010: In his version to the Hindochas about how he came to be freed from the car unscathed, which his mother-in-law appeared to found implausible, Dewani describes how one of the gunmen got out of the VW Sharan in a futile attempt to open a rear door and free him, before forcing him out through a window instead. 'He tried to open the door from the outside – and it would not open…' Dewani tells the family, adding that he was instead ejected through a passenger window as the car continued to move. 'He then just pushed my head through the window and just rolled me out like a roly poly onto the road.' Dewani's account of how he was freed from the taxi (above) before his wife was shot dead differed over time . 2014: By the time he offers an explanation to his murder trial, Dewani's recollection of how he was forced out of the car, and whether the car was moving at the time or not, is vague. 'They became angrier and shouted at me to get out. The one with the gun put it to my head again and threatened to shoot me if I did not get out. 'I tried to open the door but it would not open. I recall the window opening. I recall hitting the ground and the car speeding away,' his statement reads. In an apparent effort to explain why his most recent account of events  lacks the specific details that he recalled in his police interviews, Dewani claims: 'As a consequence of the traumatic experience which resulted in the loss of my wife, I have been hospitalised for over three years and suffered from severe post traumatic stress disorder. 'This, and the resultant flashbacks, nightmares and anxiety attacks, have affected my memory and impacted on my ability to precisely and chronologically recall events concerning this terrible incident.'

"Attacked: Levi Rosenblat, 22, is in hospital after he was stabbed in the temple early on Tuesday . A knife-wielding man has been shot dead by police after he burst into a Brooklyn synagogue and stabbed an Israeli student in the head while shouting: 'Kill the Jews!' Calvin Peters, 51, stormed into the Chabad-Lubavitch Hasidic world headquarters in Crown Heights at about 1.40am on Tuesday and attacked Levi Rosenblat, who was studying inside the synagogue. Rosenblat, who is in stable condition in hospital after being stabbed in the temple, only arrived in the U.S. two weeks ago, the New York Daily News reported. Witnesses heard the man saying 'Kill the Jews' repeatedly and several other people immediately intervened, said Chaim Landa, a spokeswoman for Chabad-Lubavitch. A witness flagged down a patrol officer, who confronted the stabber and told him to put the knife down. He initially put it down, but picked it up again, police said. More officers responded and repeatedly ordered the man to drop the knife. He refused and, with the knife in his hand, charged at one of the officers, who fired once, striking the man in the torso, police said. Police said no other officers discharged their weapons. Footage of the incident shared by 0404 shows the man moving towards police with the knife as an officer shouts: 'Drop the f***ing knife'. As the person recording the video seeks shelter behind a book case, a single shot rings out. Scroll down for videos . Stand off: The stabber, identified as Calvin Peters, can be seen after police confront him for stabbing a 22-year-old student in a Brooklyn synagogue on Tuesday morning. He was later shot by an officer . Shot: Police say he refused to drop his knife and then ran at an officer, who shot him once in the torso. A grab from video from 0404 shows the man being handcuffed after he was gunned dow . The man was taken to a hospital where he was pronounced dead. Police said he was from New York City and had a criminal history. CNN reported that he was believed to be homeless. A nine-inch knife, with a four-inch blade, was recovered at the scene, police said. A witness told the Daily News, that he ran over to Rosenblat, who is from Beitar Illit in Gush Etzion, after he was stabbed. 'I went over to the floor,' he said. 'I saw the teenager on the floor, his hair was blood. He was saying ""save me"".' Another witness said they saw the stabber enter the synagogue an hour earlier and ask for a book before returning with a knife and carried out his attack. Weapon: This blood-covered knife was recovered at the scene following the early-morning attack . Scene: The attack unfolded at the Chabad-Lubavitch Hasidic world headquarters in Crown Heights . In shock: Members of the Lubavitch community and police officers stand outside Chabad-Lubavitch Hasidic headquarters on Tuesday, just hours after the knife-wielding man was shot dead . 'We commend the heroic efforts of the individuals who were present and took immediate action. If not for their intervention the outcome could have been, God forbid far worse,' said Landa. 'While we are very pained by everything that has unfolded, we are very grateful to the police for their quick response and are working closely with the authorities in their ongoing investigation,' she added.

"Georgine Benvenuto was left with cuts to her nose and chin after a mistletoe drone crashed into her face during a launch event at TGI Friday's . It was supposed to provide the perfect festive romantic moment: a mistletoe drone that would get diners at TGI Friday's to kiss on camera. But the restaurant's plan to lure in festive diners went horribly wrong after one of the machines smashed into a photographer's face at a launch event in New York. Georgine Benvenuto was left in shock after the machine flew into her face, slicing off the tip of her nose and cutting open a section of her lip. The ten-inch drone became so entangled in Miss Benvenuto's hair that she even feared she would lose an eye. The incident took place as Miss Benvenuto and other journalists gathered at the Sheepshead Bay restaurant to witness the four-bladed drones embark on their maiden flight. Miss Benvenuto told Business Insider: 'If that would've hit me in my eye, I wouldn't be working tomorrow. 'If this thing continued to spin, it would've taken my eye out without a doubt.' The drama unfolded after the photojournalist arrived at the restaurant to take a photo of a couple kissing beneath the remote-controlled helicopter. Miss Benvenuto admitted she had been uncomfortable with the set-up from the start - particularly when she realised the shoot would take place inside the establishment. She told the Daily Intelligencer that she felt 'uneasy' that the drone could interfere with or hurt the kissing couple while it was hovering over them. But Miss Benvenuto got to work, managing to successfully take photos of the couple kissing beneath the larger of the two drones. After that, pilot David Quiones decided to show reporter Vanessa Ogle from the Brooklyn Daily - another journalist invited to the launch - how the drone could land on her hand. But something went wrong when the reporter 'flinched' - causing the drone to 'fly into' Miss Benvenuto's face. She said: 'It kind of landed, but it did something to her hand - I don't know whether it was buzzing or what - but she flinched. 'And when she flinched - I was standing maybe a foot away from her - and this smaller toy drone for children flies into my face at that point.' A wire from the craft became entangled in Miss Benvenuto's hair as she sat with other reporters to see the drones take their first flight . A photographer has been injured by one of TGI Friday's mistletoe drones after it lost control and hit her in the face, leaving her with cuts on her nose and lip (file image) The photographer told how the fishing wire, which was used to connect the mistletoe to the drone, became trapped in her hair. It then began 'twirling and twirling and twirling' on her nose as Miss Benvenuto attempted to 'shoo it away', eventually cutting her on the chin. Miss Benvenuto was soon able to remove the drone from her hair and grabbed tissues to stem the bleeding. But she claims Mr Quiones did not help her in her moment of turmoil  - and did not even remove his hands from the controls. She claims he had even told Miss Benvenuto that the drone could not cut her, prompting her to put her finger to her nose and say: 'It just did'. After the crash, Mr Quiones blamed the accident on the reporter 'flinching' when he tried to negotiate the craft's landing. He also said that diners would not be put off by the accident, because everyone is well aware of the risks. According to the Brooklyn Daily, he said: 'If people get hurt, they're going to come regardless. People get hurt in airplanes, they still fly. There is a risk involved - anything flying, there is risk.' After the accident the drone pilot blamed a fellow diner for the accident, saying she flinched when he tried to land it on her hand, which sent it careening into the woman's face . TGI Friday's was using two drones to romance diners when the accident took place - one small craft with four blades and a larger one with six uncovered propellers. The accident involved the smaller of the two. A spokesman for the restaurant chain said that events in Long Island and Texas had passed without any bloodshed and tried to reassure diners that the risk of injury is low. TGI Fridays launched the drone gimmick after research revealed that 47 per cent of Americans have never enjoyed a kiss under the mistletoe. The study also found that just 27 percent of people were planning to lock lips with someone under the festive plant this year - something the restaurant hopes to change. Pilot David Quiones said he didn't think the crash would put diners off coming to the restaurant, adding: 'People get hurt in airplanes, they still fly. There is a risk involved - anything flying, there is risk' The drone, which can fly at speeds of up to 35mph usually hovers around 8ft above couples, before swooping in for the kiss. 'Everyone loves a good Christmas party, but we all know things can be a bit awkward until someone breaks the ice,' said TGI Fridays marketing manager Rachel Waller of the drone's uses. 'We wanted to see how we could make Christmas get-together in our restaurants even more entertaining. 'We offered guests the encouragement they need to make their move. 'Our mistletoe drones are the perfect way to do this. Not only are they great fun for the entire restaurant, but they help people get a little closer at this romantic time of the year. 'Maybe we'll have had our first mistletoe drone wedding by this time next year.' A spokesman for TGI Friday's said launch events in Long Island and Texas had passed without any bloodshed, and tried to reassure customers that the risk of injury is low .","TGI Friday launched mistletoe drone to tempt diners into kissing .

"J Edgar Hoover refused permission for Bond producers to even mention his agency by name after he was passed a memo on Goldfinger . Nowadays James Bond is a household name that everyone, from designer brands to luxury car makers, wants to be associated with. But back in 1964 - just two years after the Cuban Missile Crisis - the FBI reacted with horror after learning of plans to feature the Bureau in upcoming Bond flick Goldfinger. J Edgar Hoover refused filmakers permission to even mention his agency by name after being passed a memo explaining that Bond was a British spy who had 'beautiful women presenting themselves to him in scanty attire'. Newly released FBI files show that the movie was brought to the attention of the Bureau after producer Harry Saltzman requested the use of military aircraft during filming. The request prompted the FBI, which was still on high alert after years of Cold War tensions, to run background checks on Saltzman, author Ian Fleming, and screenplay writer Richard Maibaum. While the reports seem to have got some information spot on - referring to Fleming's novels as being filled with 'sex and bizarre situations' - in other places the intelligence was sadly lacking. For example, the character of Felix Leiter is described as 'a fictional FBI agent', while any true Bond fan will know he in fact works for the CIA. The reports, which were revealed by the Guardian, also wrongly name actor Jack Lord as the man playing Leiter, when in fact he was replaced by Cec Linder in Goldfinger. And, in a spectacular rewrite of the ending, the report claims that Goldfinger's attempted robbery of Fort Knox is solved by the FBI themselves, when in fact James Bond foils the dastardly plot. The FBI were clearly not impressed with what they found, writing that Fleming's book was 'not the type where we would want any mention of the FBI or a portrayal of FBI agents, no matter how favorable they might look in the movie. 'Fleming's stories generally center around sex and bizarre situations and, certainly, are not the type with which we want to be associated.' After reading the reports, Hoover responded that agents speaking to Saltzman should 'forcibly bring to his attention' a law 'which prohibits the use of the words ""Federal Bureau of Investigation"" or any of its written initials without my written permission.' The documents also contain wrong information about previous Bond films, including From Russia With Love which is repeatedly referred to as 'For Russian With Love', and is said to contain 'sex and excessive nudity.' The memos also reveal that 1964 was not the first time Ian Fleming's books had been brought to the attention of intelligence agents, after the author mentioned the FBI on several occasions. Scroll down for video . The FBI ran checks on Bond, saying the novels involved 'beautiful women presenting themselves to him in scanty attire'. But they also got the ending of the film wrong, claiming the FBI foils Goldfinger's plot . The memo reads: 'All of these references have been favourable in the past. His stories are generally filled with beautiful women presenting themselves to him in scanty attire. 'It was reported in Life magazine in August 1962 that President Kennedy was one of his most avid readers.' But despite the favourable references and presidential endorsement, Hoover ordered his agents to contact Saltzman and 'vigorously protest any mention of FBI or portrayal of its agents in his proposed movie.' Behind-the-scenes details about the production are also unearthed in the secret files, including the fact that film company United Artists paid $300,000 fro the script, and planned to spend $3million making it.","Producer Harry Saltzman sent FBI request to use military planes in film .

"She is a distinguished actress, known for her roles in Shakespearean and classical drama and has been vocal in her opposition to racism. But Janet Suzman risked angering her peers and audiences when she said theatre was intrinsically part of white culture and black people were not interested. The actress, who has recently appeared with African actor Khayalethu Anthony in Solomon and Marion, said non-white people rarely go to see plays because, she believes 'they're not interested. It's not in their culture.' Actress Janet Suzman has angered her contemporaries after she said theatre was a 'white invention' and black people were not interested in watching plays because it is not an intrinsic part of their culture. She is pictured in an appearance in Solomon and Marion with actor Khayalethu Anthony earlier this year . She told The Guardian: 'Theatre is a white invention, a European invention, and white people go to it. It's in their DNA. It starts with Shakespeare.' She was responding to comments from actress Meera Syal who recently called for theatres to do more to cater for Asian audiences. Syal criticised her statements and told the newspaper the argument was about appealing to people from diverse backgrounds, not trying to claim theatre was the invention of a single culture. Others dismissed Suzman's words as incorrect, while one director said the actresses words implied she should just give up now. Suzman, 71, was born in South Africa and has worked there as a director. The actress has also supported the work of her aunt Helen Suzman, an anti apartheid campaigner. She enjoyed an early successful career at the Royal Shakespeare Company, starting as Joan of Arc in The Wars of the Roses. She has also performed in classical productions and directed in her native South Africa. Janet Suzman said black audiences did not come to see her performance in Solomon and Anthony with  actor Khayalethu Anthony and said it was up to writers to get different audiences interested in theatre . Janet Suzman (left) as Luciana in the Comedy of Errors and as Lady Anne (right) in Richard III, both in 1963 . However Suzman, who is the is the ex-wife of former Royal Shakespeare Company director Sir Trevor Nunn, said that there was still not enough interest in theatre from black culture, and it was up to writers to get more people from different backgrounds interested in watching plays. The actress, who was made a dame in 2011, said she had recently performed in Solomon and Marion, a South African play, with Khayalethu Anthony. The actor is from Cape Town and is known for his role in Mandela: A Long Walk to Freedom. But she said she was concerned as black people did not come to see the play, and reported seeing just one black person in the audience at The Print Room in London. She added: 'And they don't bloody come. 'They're not interested. It's not in their culture, that's why. Just as their stuff is not in white culture.' Janet Suzman was born in South Africa in 1939. Her grandfather, Max Sonnenberg, was a member of South African Parliament while her aunt was an anti-apartheid campaigner. Dame Janet Suzman is a renowned actress, known for her Shakespearean roles in the 1960s . Suzman enjoyed early success with the Royal Shakespeare Company - appearing in The War of the Roses and playing heroines in a number of key works including Titus Andronicus and The Merchant of Venice. She has also appeared in classical plays such as Hedda Gabbler and Chekhov's The Three Sisters. In the 1960s and 1970s she appeared in British television drama before her first film role in Nicholas and Alexandra in 1971. Suzman appeared in a few films in the 1980s, including A Dry White Season with Marlon Brando in 1983. The actress also turned director in her later life, directing Othello back in her native South Africa. Most recently she performed in Solomon and Marion at the Print Theatre earlier this year. She married director Sir Trevor Nunn in 1969 and the couple, who have a son, divorced 20 years later. Suzman is a patron for charity Dignity in Dying. The actress was named in the Queen's Honours List in 2011 and made a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire for her services to the acting profession. She has honorary degrees from a number of universities including Cape Town, Leicester and London. Meera Syal, the actress, has called for theatres to stop ignoring Asians and put on more diverse performances. She said she had never heard 'a single race or culture claim theatre was their invention before.' She said the most important thing was not about where theatre came from, but about how we can make productions more relevant for a variety of audiences. Nadia Latif, a theatre director from Sudan, branded the actress 'a hideous woman' in light of her comments. Ms Latif, who has about 10 years experience working as a freelance director, said she felt it was simply not true that black people and those from ethnic minorities were not interested in going to the theatre. Meera Syal called for more theatre for Asian people . She said: 'I'm a theatre director and these comments hit me to the core of who I am.' Ms Latif said she did not think it was true and said she herself was a young black member of theatre audiences 20 years ago. She said she did not believe people did not go to the theatre because of their cultural background but more because they are 'frequently priced out of it.' She acknowledged more needed to be done but said there should be a focus on how many successful black actors and directors there already were, as well as people interested in theatre. The director said there was a 'real problem when people try to make something about monoculture' and instead it was about making something diverse and appealing to all. She added: 'Also you have to remember that a theatre in Notting Hill isn't representative of the nation's theatre-going.' A spokeswoman for the National Theatre said they were doing their best to appeal to audiences from diverse ethnic backgrounds, but admitted there was still more to be done. She said: 'We want to present a diverse and popular repertoire which can reach the widest possible audience and represent the widest range of voices. The emergence of artists and voices who reflect the full diversity of the nation and the capital on our stages is key to this; much remains to be done but we hope that recent and current productions such as The Amen Corner and Moon on a Rainbow Shawl.'","Actress Janet Suzman said theatre is a white invention and in their culture .

"Cedric Bartee was critically wounded after being shot by Sergeant Robert McCarthy on Monday night . A Florida sheriff has asked state police to open a criminal investigation after a 28-year-old unarmed black man in a stolen car was shot and critically wounded early on Monday by a white officer. Witnesses report that the man, who has been named as Cedric Bartee, had his hands up when he was shot. Orange County Sheriff Jerry Demings called for calm and said he was determined to be as transparent as possible in light of amid racially charged protests nationwide about police violence. 'I ask everyone to not rush to judgment and allow the . investigation to be completed,' he said at a news conference in Orlando.

After locating a stolen car at an apartment complex just . after midnight on Monday, Sergeant Robert McCarthy fired three . shots, one of which hit Cedric Bartee.

"Twitter users reacted angrily after this image was posed online, showing a bar advertising six shots for $10 - dubbing it the 'Michael Brown special' A bar owner has caused controversy after offering a deal of six shots for $10 - naming it the 'Michael Brown special'. The owners of Mug Shots bar in St Joseph, Missouri, put up a sign on Friday advertising the offer which references the number of times the unarmed teen was shot by officer Darren Wilson. And when the deal caused outrage on Twitter, he tried to use the controversy to cash in, thanking people for sharing the story, and adding: 'everyone will know where the cheapest drinks are now.' According to the Kansas City Star, a worker at the bar wrote: 'Just wanna thank everyone who is going on about our shot special. Its just giving us free publicity. 'Everyone will know where the cheapest drinks are now. It also shows everyone that we believe our slogan, ""where sarcasm is always free."" 'We have never been hateful to anyone because of race, class, sex or sexual preference.' The sign was initially posted online on Saturday, along with the comment saying the bar owners 'might not have a functioning brain'. The sign quickly drew criticism, with some Twitter users branding the bar 'racist', while user Randall G branded the stunt 'bizarre and disgusting', and another called Paula asked: 'What the f*** is wrong with people?' Around 20 protesters gathered outside the bar on Saturday, and the sign was later removed, and replaced with one mocking the owners. Scroll down for video . The deal references the number of times unarmed teenager Brown was shot by officer Darren Wilson in Ferguson, St Louis, sparking months of protests (picured, officers stand over Brown's body) The decision by a Grand Jury not to indict Wilson over the shooting caused fresh outcry two weeks ago, drawing people back on to the street of Ferguson, where there was widespread looting (file image) A co-owner of the bar told Fox4 that other drinking spots in the same area had also been promoting Brown-themed promotions, so he decided to steal the idea for himself. He added that the promotion had not meant to cause harm, and conceded that it had been unwise to make it a 'shot special'. The news has emerged as Brown prosecutor Bill McCulloch continues to release Grand Jury evidence, which today included recordings of the moments after Brown was shot. The radio conversations show that officers arriving on the scene in Ferguson, St Louis, made several panicked calls for backup and 'crowd control' before calling for medical assistance. In one message, an officer says 'there's going to be trouble' as anguished wailing can be heard in the background. The decision by a Grand Jury not to indict Wilson for the shooting caused outrage, sparking days of protests across the country, while shops in Ferguson were burned and looted.

"Tragic: Sofia Liu, six, was killed by an Uber driver as he drove around San Francisco waiting for a fare . An Uber driver has been charged over the death of a six-year-old girl he ran over as she walked on a pedestrian crossing with her mother and brother on New Year's Eve. Syed Muzaffar was looking for a fare with the taxi-service app when he made a turning straight into Sofia Liu, six, her mother Ang Liu, and brother Anthony, four, on a crosswalk in San Francisco. Ms Liu suffered broken bones and her son was also hurt in the collision. Her daughter's death has sparked a legal and regulatory tussle over Uber's responsibility for the services it facilitates. Muzzafar, 57, from Union City, California, who stopped and was arrested at the scene on December 31, 2013, was yesterday finally charged with misdemeanor vehicular manslaughter over Sofia's death. His arrest follows a long and continuing legal tussle between Uber and Sofia's family, who have named the firm in a wrongful-death lawsuit that alleges use of Uber falls foul of California's distracted driving laws. Uber had been heavily criticised after it quickly moved to disavow any responsibility for Sofia's death, admitting Muzzaffar was a 'partner' but pointing out he was not on a paid fare when he hit her. 'The driver in question was not providing services on the Uber system during the time of the accident. The driver was a partner of Uber and his account was immediately deactivated,' the company wrote on its blog. However, it is understood Muzzafar had been using Uber for abound a month as a full-time job to support his four children. Court records seen by ABC7 News indicate he had his Uber app on at the time of the accident. Shortly after Sofia's death, Ms Liu spoke through a translator to tell ABC7 News what happened. 'Suddenly a car came from the left, hit into Sophia, smashed into me and knocked Anthony to the ground,' she said. 'It all happened in an accident, but I saw the driver looking down at his phone. His face was lit up by the light of his phone.' Co-accused: Driver Syed Muzaffar was finally charged over Sofia's death yesterday. He and Uber, the taxi-service company, are co-defendants in a wrongful-death lawsuit brought by Sofia's family . Uber maintains that drivers without vehicles are not Uber cars. Diane M. Doolitte, a lawyer for the tech firm, was quoted by Buzzfeed as saying: 'Uber and its affiliated companies sympathise with the Liu family and understand their desire for redress for their loss and their injuries. 'However, [Uber and its affiliated companies] did not cause this tragic accident.' But lawyers for Ms Liu and Muzzafar have both challenged Uber's position. Chris Dolan, representing Ms Liu said the company needs drivers to be logged in to connect them to customers, making them essentially on the clock. Graham Archer, for Muzaffar, has said his client had already dropped off one customer through Uber that night and was logged into the app to find more fares.","Sofia Liu died after she was hit by an Uber driver while on a crosswalk .

"Footballer John Terry has bought the £4.35million former mansion of golfer Colin Montgomerie, downsizing from the £16million home which he sold earlier this year. The £170,000-a-week Chelsea captain has bought the seven-bedroom property, which is nestled in a half-acre estate in Oxshott, Surrey, after selling his nine-bedroom mansion, situated just a few hundred yards away. He made a £10million profit by selling his luxury home to General Sultan bin Mohammed al-Naamani, a senior minister for the Arab state - who reportedly purchased it for his boss Sultan Qaboos bin Said in January. Chelsea captain John Terry, 33, has bought the former home of golfer Colin Montgomerie (number three) after selling his nine-bedroom mansion (number two), and his original house (number one) in Oxshott, Surrey . The former England captain has bought the seven-bedroom property, which is nestled in a half-acre estate in Oxshott, Surrey, after selling his nine-bedroom mansion, situated just yards away, which sold for £16million . The footballer sold his former home (bottom) for £16million in January. He had planned to move into the property with his family, after building it next door to his original Oxshott home (top) which he sold in 2013 . Terry and his wife Toni (together above) had planned to move into the white nine-bedroom mansion adjacent to their original red-brick home but sold it in January after reportedly getting an 'offer they couldn't refuse' The former England captain (left) has bought a seven-bed mansion which was formerly owned by golfer Colin Montgomerie (right). The footballer paid £4.35million for the home, which is smaller than his former house . Terry, 33, had planned to move into the brand new white mansion, which he built next door to his old property – a red-brick house which he sold last year for £5.25million after three years on the market. However, he received an out-of-the-blue £16million offer for his new home from Mr al-Naamani, who is believed to have bought the home for his wealthy boss - Sultan Qaboos bin Said, 72 - who has an estimated fortune of £650million. Terry, together with his wife Toni and twin children, then had to move into rented accommodation while searching for a new home - which he has now bought from the world-famous golfer. The property, which boasts seven bedrooms, six bathrooms, four reception rooms, and a two-bedroom staff annex, is just a few hundred yards from Terry's former properties. However, it is considerably smaller than his former homes, which are all located just a short drive from Chelsea's training ground in Cobham. A source told The Sun: 'It's a lovely house but a considerable downsize. Obviously he has invested his huge profits from the last place elsewhere or they are sitting in the bank.' It is understood Terry has carried out an extensive  refurbishment of his new property, estimated to be in the region of £1.5million, which saw high-spec renovations to the interior, exterior and garden. The property was owned by Montgomerie a few years ago and he is thought to have used it as a place to stay while he had a neighbouring house renovated. The Scottish golfer bought a house in a nearby road and had it razed to the ground before building a multi-million mansion in its place. He stayed in the property now owned by Terry while the works were being carried out. It is thought Terry looked at several houses in the area before his purchase, including Montgomerie's new mansion which has an estimated value of £18million. Terry's new property boasts seven bedrooms, six bathrooms, four reception rooms and a grand stairway. These photographs show its interior before it underwent an extensive top-to-bottom refurbishment by Terry . The property is nestled in half-acre estate in leafy Oxshott and has large, spacious living areas (pictured) It also boasts a modern kitchen and dining area (pictured), as well as a two-bedroom annex for staff . The Oxshott mansion is nestled in the wealthy suburb and boasts a large garden and beautiful views. Terry is thought to have had the interior, exterior and gardens completely renovated to a cost of in the region of £1.5m . Terry - who is estimated to be worth £29million - received a total of £21.25million after selling his two neighbouring houses, including one which was to be his dream home. The footballer bought his first home in Oxshott for £2.25million in 2003 and reportedly had to re-mortgage four times. A few years later it went on the market and, after receiving no offers, the former England captain was advised to drop the asking price by £750,000 in 2010. However, helped by the burgeoning property market, he was finally able to sell it for more than the £5million asking price, helping him finance his second mansion. The second property, built next door to his former home in 2007 for £1.8million, had a further £4million spent on renovating it, with a fishing lake even being built in the back garden. Terry's former homes were situated adjacent to each other (centre) after he chose to build a custom-made nine-bedroom mansion next to his original red-brick house in Oxshott, Surrey. He later sold both of them . Terry and his wife Toni (together left) sold the nine-bedroom mansion for £16million to General Sultan bin Mohammed al-Naamani, who reportedly bought it on behalf of his boss Sultan Qaboos bin Said, 72 (right) Terry was reported to have incurred a mortgage debt of £4.6million on the building of the new house. Construction work started in December 2011 and the finished mansion was believed to include a 33 x 40ft indoor swimming pool, complete with a jacuzzi, steam room and changing facilities. It also reportedly had nine bedrooms, eight bathrooms and a cinema, as well as staff accommodations and a visitor annexe in a separate wing. Following the sale to Mr al-Naamani in January, it was reported that the Omani royal family wanted the house 'at any cost' and made Terry 'an offer he couldn't refuse'. Representatives of John Terry declined to comment when contacted by MailOnline.","Chelsea footballer buys seven-bedroom Surrey mansion for £4.35million .

"A father was disgusted after his severely disabled son might have to prove he couldn't work in order to receive benefits. Liam Barker, 18, was not expected to live beyond three months old after he was born paralysed and has remained on life support since birth. But Liam defied his prognosis and . celebrated his milestone birthday in December last year despite being . born with an incredibly rare condition, called myotubular myopathy, a . terminal muscle wasting disease. A letter was sent to Liam Barker's home saying he might be required to attend a 'Work Capability Assessment' in order to continue to receive Employment and Support Allowance . He requires a ventilator to breathe and . needs constant care from his parents Phil Barker, 52, and Michelle, 44, . at their home in Linthorpe, Middlesbrough. The family were awaiting news on which . benefits their son would be entitled to but were shocked when they . received a letter which informed them Liam would be entitled to . employment and support allowance but that he may need to attend a 'Work . Focus interview' in order to receive them. Two weeks ago, Mrs Barker, who also has a 12-year-old daughter, discovered that Liam's child benefit payments had been stopped. Mr Barker said: 'I discovered the letter last week. We'd been on a week's respite and it was there when we got back. 'I rang Stockton Benefit Centre and a woman on the phone asked me: ""Can he work?"" 'I tried to explain his medical condition and she just said: ""It's a yes or no answer, it's a standard issue form."" Mr Barker explained that his son couldn't work but the lady on the phone said he may have to be interviewed and receive a medical assessment. The letter insulted the family who claimed the Job Centre should have looked at Liam's National Insurance records beforehand . The father explained there was no way his son could attend an interview as the only place he visits is the hospital. The family are still waiting to be instructed on what they are supposed to do now. The father believes that Job Centre Plus should know Liam's situation as they have his National Insurance number, which can be used to reveal he claims disability benefits. 'I was quite annoyed really at that,' he said. 'After 18-years surely they must know now. 'How is he going to go to a back to work interview? He cannot answer them. He can only communicate with a blink so I do not know what they are going to expect him to do. 'If another disabled person had these issues and didn't have a full time carer, they might lose their benefits or not know what to do. It's caused a lot of upset. 'I don't think they really understand the situation and if they'd just looked into his National Insurance number or looked into his records properly they would realise he can't work.' The Department of Work and Pensions says candidates found to be incapable of work, receive long term support. A spokesperson for the DWP said: 'Often as a child gets older their needs change over time. 'The Work Capability Assessment looks at what a person can do, not only on what they cannot. 'If someone is not capable of any work, then they will of course get long term incapacity support through the benefits system.'","Liam Barker, 18, can only communicate by blinking .

"He's famous for his bons mots and his unerring ability to make even the most hardened of Labour supporters laugh. Now Boris Johnson has proved that his way with words goes beyond newspaper columns and speeches after performing a version of Jessie J hit Bang Bang on live radio. During an appearance on the Capital FM breakfast show, the Mayor of London was asked to step up to the mike by hosts Lisa Snowdon and Dave Berry - and gamely agreed. While the resulting version of the song might not win any prizes for vocal theatrics or even staying in tune, the hilarious attempt is likely to raise a smile. Mr Johnson had agreed to appear on the show to discuss London's New Year's Eve fireworks but was soon drawn into a discussion about a recent performance by Jessie J. After revealing that he's a fan of the odd Jessie J tune, Mr Johnson was asked to perform his own version, which, after being tweaked by producers, also included some Cher-style synthesiser. The London mayor isn't the first guest to be asked to perform a cover version of the song - just last week, TV presenter Graham Norton was asked to do the same. In tune: Boris Johnson sings along to Jessie J's Bang Bang during an appearance on Capital FM . Cover: Prior to belting out his version of Bang Bang, Mr Johnson admitted to a fondness for Jessie J . Normal service: Mr Johnson is more often to be found debating politics rather than singing . Singing sensations: Both Australia's Tony Abbott and President Obama have been known to sing in public . But unlike the TV star, Mr Johnson has form when it comes to singing toe-curlingly bad cover versions of classic songs. Mr Johnson's best-known singing moment came during a busking competition in 2013, when, guitar in hand, he belted out a version of Bob Marley's Three Little Birds. And Mr Johnson is in good company. Other politicians to let loose in public include President Obama, who belted out a few lines from Al Green's Let's Stay Together during his re-election campaign in 2012, and Vladimir Putin who sang Blueberry Hill at a charity fundraiser in St Petersburg in 2010. Australian prime minister Tony Abbott is another fan of impromptu singalongs, singing along to Elvis Presley's Suspicious Minds during a 2012 radio appearance.","The London mayor made an attempt at Jessie J's Bang Bang .

"Most people don't think twice about taking price tags off of presents before wrapping them. But for 19-year-old Jade Marshall, doing so would be absolutely terrifying because of a rare phobia: she was frightened of stickers. Miss Marshall, from Brighton, first realised she had a fear of stickers when she was seven at a sleepover. Jade Marshall, 19, suffered a phobia of stickers which meant she was terrified of shopping because of the price labels on clothes, shoes and other goods . After seeing a hypnotherapist, Miss Marshall was able to overcome her phobia and can now handle stickers. This year, she will finally be able to wrap and unwrap Christmas presents . Since then, her discomfort developed into a full-blown phobia, which left her too scared to go shopping due to price stickers. It affected her work as a nursery worker because often children would bring in strips of stickers or sticker books to play with. Eventually, she went to see a hypnotherapist, who coined the term 'pittakionophobia' for her rare condition. He explained that like most phobias, pittakionophobia is an anxiety disorder rooted in a bad experience with stickers in childhood. Miss Marshall was delighted when after a month, her phobia was cured and this year, she is able to take the stickers off her Christmas presents ready to wrap them for the first time ever. The nursery worker said: 'I knew it was ridiculous because stickers can't hurt you or anything, I just couldn't help it. 'It was affecting every aspect of my life and really getting me down. 'Now I don't have to be scared to go shopping and I'm a lot more comfortable in my work place.' Miss Marshall says her fear started at aged seven at a sleepover where one end of a friend's bed was covered in stickers. She said: 'This girl had stickers from school all over one end of her bed on the bed stand. 'We were meant to be top and tailing but I didn't want to sleep near the stickers - I don't know why they just seemed weird. Peter Field, the therapist who treated Miss Marshall says the actual causes of pittakionophobia almost always lie in the individual's past. He said: 'Because of some past experience, the individual's subconscious mind has linked the sight or thought of stickers or sticky labels with danger and anxiety. 'Most often, this has happened in childhood or in the early years of adolescence, though in some cases it may have occurred later in life. 'Such an experience may have happened directly, as a result of a traumatic experience involving a sticker - having one stuck to some part of the body, for example - or indirectly because of another person's negative experience that was witnessed by the person who would then develop the phobia.' Source: Peter Field . 'You know what kids can be like and the more I asked the more she said no. 'In the end I asked her parents to take me home, but they couldn't because they'd had a drink. 'I had to sleep on the floor. I just remember lying there thinking about the morning when I'd finally be able to go home.' Her fear began to get worse and affect her job: she could not even be around children at the nursery wearing stickers. Miss Marshall said: 'I was okay with brand new packs, sticky tape and post it notes, but nothing other than that. 'It was especially bad if the sticker was dirty or had started peeling off. 'It made going shopping a nightmare because I would be scared of size stickers on clothes or price stickers on shoes.' A phobia of stickers is so rare that only one expert has given it a name - pittakionophobia. Peter Field, a hypnotherapist based in Birmingham, felt so sorry for Miss Marshall he offered to cure her phobia. Now she is finally able to take the price stickers off her Christmas presents for the first time ever. Miss Marshall said: 'I think everyone would have treatment for their phobia if they could. 'At first my family didn't believe me and would try and come near me with stickers, but once they saw my reaction they were very understanding. 'I no longer have to worry it will affect me when I'm out with friends who don't know about it and I can get on with my job without feeling uncomfortable.' The hypnotherapist who treated Miss Marshall coined a new name for her rare phobia: pittakionophobia. He says there are countless people who suffer from the fear of stickers who do not know treatment is available . Peter Field, who claims he is the first and only hypnotherapist in the country to treat this phobia, said: 'I was happy to play my part in freeing her from her life-long phobia. 'Very few therapists have even heard of this condition - which is why I created the term 'pittakionophobia', let alone know how to effectively treat it. 'There are countless people who suffer unnecessarily from the fear of stickers and simply do not know that effective treatment is available. 'I have successfully treated people with all kind of phobias, from fear of velvet to fear of clowns, fear of worms to fear of the wind, as well as the better know ones such as fear of spiders, heights, claustrophobia and so on. 'I believe that every phobia can be effectively treated and the phobic person freed from a lifetime of unnecessary anxiety and fear, provided the therapist truly understands how to do this. 'The real problem is that most of those suffering from the fear of stickers simply do not know that effective treatment is available.' Ms Emma Citron, consultant clinical psychologist with a specialty in phobias, said cognitive behavioural therapy can be succesfully be used to treat phobias such as Miss Marshall's. She told MailOnline: 'Anything can become a phobia. Buttons, is a common one. People get uncomfortable if there are buttons in a room, even if they are in a pot. 'Most people have an innate phobia of snakes, but all other phobias are not rational. 'They could have a phobia of rats, mice, spiders - or even collars on shirts. 'We might be able to understand phobias of snakes, spiders and mice, more easily. We might rationalise it’s because they carry disease. 'But they are not rational, they are no more rational than the phobia of collars because rats don’t have bubonic plague anymore and spiders in the UK are unlikely to harm a person. Clinical psychologist and phobia expert Ms Emma Citron says all phobias are irrational and normally stem from a traumatic event in childhood. Pictured is a spider, which is a common phobia for many people . 'About a third of people can remember a traumatic event which is the source of their phobia. But the rest don’t have such a memory – and it could be there was no traumatic event. 'It’s known that phobias are made worse by avoiding them. If you are scared of the tube and you avoid the tube, you may develop a phobia. If you force yourself to travel by tube, you won’t. 'The usual treatment is Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) administered by a professional. You can be referred by your GP. 'That’s the only treatment that works. You help people change their thoughts. 'Then you might expose them to different ‘grades’ of whatever they are scared of, under psychological supervision. The person themselves sets the hierarchy, so they can cope. And they are taught coping mechanisms such as relaxation techniques. 'Some accredited psychologists might use hypnotherapy, but this would not normally be used in isolation, it would be used with CBT.'","Jade Marshall, 19, discovered her fear of stickers at seven years old .

"The fossil of an ancient animal covered with spines that resembles a 'squashed bird's nest', could shed new light on life in Earth’s ancient seas. Nidelric pugio lived 520 million years ago and belonged to a group of bizarre, balloon-shaped animals called chancelloriids, which had an outer skeleton of defensive spines. Its fossilised remains were unearthed in Chengjiang, in southern China, and is nmow offering a glimpse into how early life functioned. The ‘Nidelric pugio’ lived 520 million years ago and it its fossil resembles a squashed birds nest, according to experts. This imahe shows the whole creature, which measures three-and-a-half inches (9cm) long . The animal was flattened during the fossilisation process, giving it a squashed appearance. The rocks where it was found yielded a diverse array of fossils preserved with traces of their soft anatomy, including their legs, eyes, guts and even brains. Most of the fossils are animals that can be related to modern forms, including distant relatives of arthropods such as crabs and lobsters and a wide variety of worms. But among them are several enigmatic fossils that don’t seem to fit in with anything living today, including chancelloriids. The ancient creature belonged to a group of bizarre, balloon-shaped animals called chancelloriids, which had an outer skeleton of defensive spines. This image shows individual spines, which are a few millimetres long . The ancient creature lived around 520 million years ago in ancient oceans. It belonged to a group of balloon-shaped animals called chancelloriids. Chancelloriids had bag-like bodied with an orifice on top and show no signs of having had internal organs. Different species come in different shapes and sizes, ranging from cone-shaped creatures to disk-like and cylindrical specimens. They probably lived on muddy sea floors - some with the help of 'anchors' - and are often found attached to other organisms or shells. They were probably filter feeders. Nidelric pugio was discovered in Chengjiang in southern China. The animal was flattened during the fossilisation process, giving it a squashed appearance. It bears no resemblance to living marine animals, unlike some of the other fossils found. Dr Tom Harvey from the University of Leicester said: ‘There is only one fossil of this enigmatic animal after 30 years of collecting by our Chinese colleagues at Chengjiang. ‘It is exceptionally rare, but it shows us just how strange and varied the shapes of early animals could be. Tom Hearing, a PhD student from Leicester’s Department of Geology who is working on the skeletons of Cambrian fossils, said: ‘We usually only get the broken-up remains of ancient animal skeletons. ‘With this specimen we can see how all the different parts of the skeleton stuck together. ‘It tells us much about how early animals functioned, how they might have interacted with other animals, and how they might have protected themselves from predators.’ The creature was unearthed by Professor Xianguang Hou from the Yunnan Key Laboratory for Palaeobiology at Yunnan University in China, in collaboration with the Universities of Leicester and Oxford. It was described in the journal Scientific Reports. The fossil has been named in honour of University of Leicester palaeontologist Professor Richard Aldridge who was a world leader in Chengjiang fossil research and passed away earlier this year. The name of the fossil is derived from the Latin Nidus, meaning ‘bird’s nest’ or ‘fancied resemblance to’ and adelric, which comes from from the Old English personal name ‘Aedelic’ - ‘adel’ meaning ‘noble’ and ‘ric’ meaning ‘a ruler’- which is a source for the name Aldridge.

"The number of people losing their lives to malaria has halved since 2000, but experts warn the progress made in West Africa is in jeopardy as resources and funds are channeled into fighting Ebola. Fragile gains against malaria in the region have been hampered by the Ebola outbreak, which has so far claimed the lives of more than 6,300 people. In Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia malaria programmes have been suspended in some areas while resources are directed into battling the deadly virus. And the epidemic has put a huge strain on already fragile health services in the three countries, hit hardest by the worst Ebola outbreak in history. The World Health Organisation's director general  Margaret Chan, said: 'The collapse of health systems has affected all core malaria interventions and is threatening to reverse recent gains.' Scroll down for video . The fight against Ebola in West Africa is 'threatening to reverse recent gains' in the battle against malaria, World Health Organisation experts have warned . While deaths from malaria have halved from 2000 to 2013, WHO director general said the collapse of health systems in Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea poses a threat to the successes in fighting malaria . Across the world, malaria deaths were down 47 per cent between 2000 and 2013. Fatalities decreased 53 per cent in children under the age of five - the equivalent of averting around 3.9 million children's deaths. In sub-Saharan Africa, where 90 per cent of all malaria deaths occur, the mortality rate fell by 54 per cent - 58 per cent in under fives, the equivalent of around 3.9 million children's deaths averted, the WHO annual report revealed. But WHO experts have warned of major gaps in access to mosquito nets and anti-malaria treatments. And the UN agency said there is a 'worrying' emergency of resistance to the most commonly used insecticides. The WHO said the number of infections in sub-Saharan Africa at any one time fell 26 per cent during the 13-year period. Meanwhile, 13 of the 97 malarial countries reported no cases of the disease last year, including two, Azerbaijan and Sri Lanka, which recorded their first ever zero results. 'These are truly unprecedented results and phenomenal news in terms of global health,' said Pedro Alonso, director of the WHO's global malaria programme. He attributed the progress in large part to increasing financial and political commitment, in particular regional efforts to work together to eliminate malaria. However, despite a threefold increase in investment since 2005, malaria programmes are still underfunded - $2.7 billion (2.2 billion euros) in 2013, compared to $5.1 billion international target. Malaria programmes have been suspended in Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia - the three nations worst hit by the current Ebola epidemic, which has so far claimed more than 6,300 lives . And people suffering malaria in the Ebola-ravaged region are reluctant to visit hospital or seek medical help over fears of contracting the deadly virus . And as a result, major gaps remain. While access to insecticide-treated bed nets has improved, 278 million of the 840 million people at risk in sub-Saharan Africa still live in households without one. As many as 15 million pregnant women do not receive any preventative treatment, while 437,000 African children are still dying from the disease each year. In West Africa, since the outbreak of the current Ebola epidemic earlier this year, the focus has shifted from fighting malaria to containing the deadly virus. Health workers had been increasingly using simple tests to diagnose malaria on the spot, to better target treatments. But these have been suspended in areas rife with Ebola. And many people suffering malaria are staying away from clinics. Richard Cibulskis, lead author of the WHO's malaria report said if people 'aren't getting treated, you can be sure that mortality is going to increase. The total death toll from malaria across the three countries was expected to be about 20,000 a year before the outbreak. Mr Cibulskis said he would not predict a figure now. More than 6, 300 people have died from Ebola in the region in the past year. Aside from the direct consequences, the resurgence of malaria could also harm the fight against Ebola because the two have similar symptoms, making it difficult to diagnose the deadly virus, the WHO said. Across the world malaria deaths fell 47 per cent over the 13-year period. But the WHO has warned of major gaps in access to mosquito nets, anti-malarial treatment and a 'worrying' resistance to insecticides . UNICEF last week launched a campaign to provide anti-malarial drugs to 2.4 million people in Sierra Leone, while global aid agency Doctors Without Borders is conducting a smaller scale effort in Liberia. Another issue threatening progress on malaria across the world is the rise of insecticide resistance, which has been reported in 49 countries since 2010 - 39 of which reported resistance to two or more insecticide classes. 'Emerging drug- and insecticide-resistance continues to pose a major threat, and if left unaddressed, could trigger an upsurge in deaths,' Dr Chan added.","Worldwide malaria deaths fell 47 per cent between 2000 and 2013 .

"The widening gap between rich and poor has held back the US economy over two decades, a new report warns today. Since 1990, rising inequality knocked almost 7 percentage points off growth in the US, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) said. The global think tank said taxes on the rich did not damage the economy, and could be used to help families with children to improve their lives. Economic growth in most major countries would have been much higher without the impact of inequality between the rich and poor, according to the OECD . Countries where income inequality is falling grow faster than those with rising inequality, the body's latest report states. 'The gap between rich and poor is now at its highest level in 30 years in most OECD countries, it said. As a result, income inequality has curbed economic growth 'significantly'. The overall increase in income inequality has been driven by the very rich 1 per cent of earners dramatically increasing their wealth, pulling away from the rest of society. But the biggest challenge to growth has been families on lower incomes 'slipping behind'. The OECD said: 'This negative effect of inequality on growth is determined not just by the poorest income decile but actually by the bottom 40% of income earners.' In part this is because people from poorer backgrounds are less likely to invest in and improve their education, making it harder for them to increase their earning potential. The report studied how changes in inequality between 1985 and 2005 affected subsequent economic growth between 1990 and 2010. It found that an increasing gap between the haves and have nots has knocked almost 7 percentage points off gross domestic product (GDP) in the US. It is estimated to have reduced growth by 10 points in Mexico and New Zealand, almost 9 points in the UK and between six and seven Italy and Sweden in the two decades pre-recession. The report could put pressure on Barack Obama to do more to target the wealthy in the tax system to support those on lower incomes . The OECD called for tax rises to be used to redistributed wealth from the richest to the poorest, insisting it would not harm growth, 'provided these policies are well designed and implemented'. OECD secretary general Angel Gurria said: 'This compelling evidence proves that addressing high and growing inequality is critical to promote strong and sustained growth and needs to be at the centre of the policy debate. 'Countries that promote equal opportunity for all from an early age are those that will grow and prosper.' It is the gap between the bottom 40 per cent and the rest of society, not just the poorest 10 per cent, that contributes to the effects of inequality on a country's growth, the paper said. The report is part of the think-tank's efforts to find the root causes and see what lessons can be learned from the global financial crisis. Anti-poverty programmes are not enough to tackle the problem, the OECD warned, claiming 'education is the key'. The paper claims to have discovered new evidence that the main way inequality affects growth is by undermining education opportunities for children from poor socio-economic backgrounds, lowering social mobility and hampering skills development. While the children of parents who have had low levels of education see their educational outcomes deteriorate as income inequality rises, there is little or no effect on people whose parents have had a middle or high level of education, it said. The paper states that investment is needed in high-quality education, training and healthcare in order to create greater equality of opportunities, and it claims redistributing taxes and benefits does not harm a country's economic growth so long as the policies are 'well-designed, targeted and implemented'.","Inequality gap wider than at any point in 30 years in most countries .

"A performance artist wound up in jail after pulling a fake penis out of his pants during a protest at a Miami art show. Kalan Sherrard, an 'avant-garde nihilist subway performer,' familiar to commuters on New York's L train, was with about 30 others protesting the wealthy at Art Basel when he reportedly tried to fight off police trying to get him out of the building. As they tried to remove him from the show, Sherrard decided this was the moment to yank out his surprise. Scroll down for video . Look at me: Kalan Sherrard, an 'avant-garde nihilist subway performer' was arrested after pulling a fake penis out on  police during a protest at Art Basel in Miami . 'The unknown item was discovered to be a prosthetic penis sex toy,' according to a report from Miami Beach Police Officer Alex Delgado as quoted in The Miami Herald. 'The item was impounded.' The officers at first thought it might be a gun. He was charged with disturbing the peace and resisting an officer without violence. The Miami New Times reports that the altercation started at about 4 p.m. when Sherrard and his partner Maria Paz Valenzuela started a disturbance. He was playing with a balloon while she read a manifesto from the Art Basel site. Sherrard was screaming 'F--- Art Basel, F--- all you rich people.' The pair were part of a larger crowd wearing masks and protesting the wealthy. Despite Sherrard's years as a performer, police say they were still completely confused by what statement he intended to convey with the fake penis. 'It's like the chicken crossing the road question,' Detective Vivian Thayer told reporters. In an interview with New York magazine earlier this year, Sherrard said he performed because 'I think it has to do with being really bored of the world, sort of — both really bored and really interested.' On Thursday Sherrard was busted for 'disorderly conduct' and 'wearing a mask on the street' according ot court documents . Speaking to the Herald after his arrest, Sherrard claimed he was told by security officers he was dressed 'too artistically' to be in the event. After begging strangers for their clothing he claims to have gone on 'a very basic anti-world rant' before security and police took notice and engaged him. Both he and Valenzuela were released the next day after each posted $1,500 in bail . The Miami New Times notes that this was Sherrard's second arrest of the week. On Thursday he was busted for 'disorderly conduct' and 'wearing a mask on the street' according ot court documents. He wrote of that incident: 'Yesterday I was arrested for Dancing and Wearing A Speaking Costume, and imprisoned for 24 hours in Miami-Dade county's series of incarceratory complexes. 'It was a Kafkaesque nightmare of juggling and impossible echoes of choice, but in the end my friends and family came through and bounced me out. Thank you so much. Minus A Day, Plus the complete clarity of repose, withdrawl, meditation and disjuncture, incarceration unfailingly punctuating the entrenchment of white supremacy, privilege, and complicity.

"A powerful nor'easter storm is battering the North East with torrential rains and up to two feet of snow - causing coastal flooding and travel delays from Delaware to Maine through Thursday. The storm has caused a massive tidal surge - more than three and a half feet in some places - that is flooding the Jersey Shore and parts of Long Island. A coastal flood warning remains in effect through this evening. Intense, driving rain soaked residents along the Interstate 95 corridor all day. The rain isn't going to let up, either. More of the same is expected for Wednesday. Commuters faced a difficult trek home as heavy rains and tidal storm surge flooded roadways in New York and other major cities. Elsewhere, snow and sleet turned roadways slick and treacherous.

The nor'easter is rumbling up the coast today, Wednesday and Thursday - though weather should clear by Thursday night . Flood warning: Storm surge of up to three and a half feet is expected for the Jersey Shore and areas along the Long Island Sound. A coastal flood warning is in effect until Tuesday night . Umbrellas were Tuesday's hottest accessory up and down the east coast (Market Street in Philadelphia pictured here) after several inches of rain fell through the day . The storm will dump up to five inches of rain on Boston, up to three inches on New York City and up to two inches on Philadelphia and Washington, DC. The rain turns to snow farther inland, with up to two feet falling on parts of Upstate New York. Buffalo could see up to 18 inches and Albany could get more than a foot. Most areas will see less than six inches, however. Most of the Interstate 95 corridor - including New York City and Boston - will not see snow. 'There is a threat of sleet and freezing rain that could make for hazardous driving conditions for the morning commute,' Benjamin Sipprell, a National Weather Service meteorologist in Taunton, Massachusetts, said. 'But it's that 1pm time frame that we are most concerned about with heavy rain and winds, and also the heaviest snow.' In Keyport, New Jersey, several feet of storm surge flooded the shore town . High tide: The storm surge caused moderate flooding Tuesday in Stone Harbor on the southern end of the Jersey Shore . Streets in Stone Harbor, New Jersey, were flooded by the high tide - though the storm surge is expected to recede later this week .

The storm made for a sloppy, slippery Tuesday morning commute in parts of Massachusetts, where state police responded to numerous crashes and spinouts caused by icy roads, some involving their own cruisers. Authorities in Rhode Island reported 90 accidents. With heavy rain falling, parts of Connecticut, Massachusetts and Rhode Island were under flood watches. The wintry mix could turn to treacherous freezing rain in parts of eastern Pennsylvania. New Hampshire awoke Tuesday morning to light snow, freezing rain and sleet. To the south, New Jersey dealt with a soaking rain and the threat of coastal flooding from morning and midday high tides. Worsening conditions were expected as the storm winds up later Tuesday, and into Wednesday in northern areas. The nor'easter will also bring high winds, with gusts up to 55mph possible across the northeast. The weather is expected to delay flights at airports from Washington, DC, to Boston. More rain: Rain will continue to fall on the northeast throughout the day Tuesday into Tuesday night . The nor'easter continues on Wednesday - dropping more rain on New York and Boston and up to two feet of snow in mountainous areas of Upstate New York . Clearing Thursday: The storm moves north and loses steam on Thursday - bringing clearer weather on Thursday - though no sunshine for New York . In Massachusetts, the storm is expected to bring mostly rain and strong winds to the eastern part of the state, but some parts of western Massachusetts could see 6 or more inches of snow on Tuesday. Other areas, including New York's Catskills and Adirondacks, could get up to 2 feet of snow through Thursday before the plodding storm takes its leave. The heavy, wet snow and gusty winds could combine to bring down tree limbs and power lines, causing outages. In New Hampshire, which is expecting a mix of rain, snow and sleet, power companies were making preparations for the storm, which comes less than two weeks after nasty Thanksgiving weather knocked out electricity to more than 200,000 people.","Nor'easter is blowing up toe coast today and Wednesday .

"Here's a unique way to find your next date. Canadian engineer James Befurt was tired of wasting time on Tinder, so he decided to take matters into his own hands. Using a computer programme, along with a clever motor setup and a stylus, the Vancouver, British Columbia-based Java developer came up with a way to get through as many of his potential soulmates as quickly as possible. Engineer James Befurt has developed a unique way to find his next potential date . Befurt has developed a contraption and computer programme that will automatically swipe right on Tinder . Apple recently revealed that Tinder was one of the most downloaded apps of the year. And - until now - it required users' undivided attention while perusing profiles. But Mr Befurt's hilarious contraption allows Tinder fans to swipe right forever - or at least until they run out of potential matches near them. He currently lives in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, though originally from the town of Kamloops, BC, which is approximately 350 km away. The clever motor setup uses a stylus, making it possible to approve profiles without paying any attention . Watch as his device swipes right for all of eternity - or until he runs out of matches in his selected area . This isn't the first time that a savvy user has attempted to hack the app. Back in September, Business Insider reported on a man who had built a Google Chrome extension to transform Tinder into a desktop interface so that he could more easily swipe through potential matches. Tinder, estimated to be worth around £1billion, was founded in September 2012 and recruits up to 20,000 new users every single day.","James Befurt has developed a tool to approve potential dates - indefinitely .

"The Danish government has passed a law banning the religious slaughter of animals for halal and kosher meat . The government in Denmark has been accused of anti-Semitism after passing a law banning the religious slaughter of animals for halal and kosher meat. After years of campaigning in the Scandinavian country, the ban came in to law yesterday. The change has been described as ‘anti-Semitic and ‘a clear interference in religious freedom’ by a group petitioning against the change. Under European regulations, animals . are required to be stunned before slaughter unless an exemption can be . found on religious grounds. And animals must be conscious when killed for the resultant meat to be kosher under Jewish law and halal under Islamic law. But, following criticism, the country's Minister for Food, Dan Jorgensen, told Denmark's TV2 that 'animal rights come before religion'. Campaign . group Danish Halal has collected more than 13,000 signatures opposing . the law change and plans to present them to Mr Jorgensen this week. The . group said: ‘The new order is a clear interference in religious freedom . and limits the Muslims and the Jews' right to practise their religion . in Denmark. ‘It is a procedure that is done under the guise of animal welfare, despite the fact that many scientific studies show that the animal suffers less when properly performed ritual slaughter than when it gets a blow to the head with a nail gun.’ The law change has also drawn criticism because it has been implemented in the same country that a giraffe was brutally slaughtered last week in front of an audience. Marius, a perfectly healthy animal, was shot, dissected in front of a crowd which included children, and fed to lions last week at Copenhagen Zoo. The law change comes shortly after Marius (the smaller giraffe) was slaughtered at Copenhagen Zoo . Despite more than 20,000 people signing an online petition to save two-year-old Marius, staff at Copenhagen Zoo went ahead and shot the animal with a bolt pistol. Young children stood at arm’s length as his carcass was skinned and dissected before the meat was thrown to the lions. The Danish zoo said the drastic move was needed to combat inbreeding and insisted the display was educational.","After years of campaigning in Denmark, the ban came in to law yesterday .
The move has been described as 'a clear interference in religious freedom'
Law change comes a week after the slaughter of a young giraffe, Marius, in Copenhagen Zoo was condemned on an international scale ."
"Heatwaves and prolonged spells of freezing weather have become more common over the past three decades, according to scientists. Researchers at the University of East Anglia  found that extreme weather conditions have been occurring more frequently in the past 30 years compared to a 130 year average. It comes as meteorologists have said that 2014 is on track to the be warmest year on record. Scroll down for video . Average global temperatures for 2014 have been higher than average and may even break previous records . Figures published by the Met Office  predicted that the global mean temperature for 2014 is 0.01 degrees C warmer than 2010, currently the warmest on record at 14.50 degrees C (58.12F) This is despite much of the northern hemisphere being plunged into temperatures well below freezing in January as North America was hit by an Arctic polar vortex. According to the latest findings from the University of East Anglia's climatic research unit, temperatures in the northern hemisphere have been more volatile than in the southern hemisphere. Extreme heatwaves in Europe like the one that killed tens of thousands in 2003 could happen every other year by 2040s, the Met Office has warned. They claim that the chances of extreme heatwaves in Europe have increased from occurring once in every 1,000 years to around one a century. Extremely warm summers that would be expected to occur twice a century in the early 2000s are also now likely to happen twice a decade, according to the research in the journal Nature Climate Change. Dr Peter Stott, co-author of the study, warned that projections of future climate change suggest that by the end of the century summers like that seen in 2003 could be considered 'unusually cool'. He said: 'This paper shows how our vulnerability to heat extremes is rapidly changing and we expect that to continue going forward.' Professor Phil Jones, who led the work, said: 'Trends in extreme heat and cold are important because they have a large impact on water supplies, agricultural productivity and other factors related to human health and wellbeing. 'Improved understanding of the spatial patterns of change are vital for understanding the causes of recent extreme weather events.' The researchers, whose findings are published in the journal Geophysical Review Letters, analysed monthly temperature records at set points around the world between 1881 and 2013. The found that on average through the 130-year period, periods of unusually cold weather increased in frequency more than extreme heatwaves. This led to a narrowing of the range of the Earth's temperatures, they said. However, in the past 30 years, the researchers found that the pattern has been reversed with incidences of hot weather increasing at a faster rate. Extreme weather can bring chaos to transport systems while causing billions of pounds worth of damage and hundreds of thousands of deaths around the world each year. Average temperatures since 1850 show that 2014 is on course to be the warmest year on record . An estimated 31,000 people died in the UK as a result of bitter temperatures during the winter of 2012/2013. During December 2013 and January 2014, 200 million people were blasted by icy temperatures as arctic winds brought heavy snow to much of North America. Temperatures fell as low as -38°C (-37°F) in Babbitt Minnesota while Wisconsin saw its lowest temperature since 1979. The cold air reached as far south as Dallas that reportedly saw temperatures plunge below −9°C  (16°F). The conditions are estimated to have cost the USA more than $5 billion and saw widespread power failures across large swathes of Canada. In some areas, temperatures were so low that it led to residents being able to throw pots of boiling water and watching them freeze before the water hit the ground. By contrast, in 2003, around 30,000 people died across Europe during a summer heatwave, where temperatures in some areas reached more than 104°F (40°C). Professor Scott Robeson, from Indiana University, who also took part in the study, said: 'Arguably, these cold extremes and warm extremes are the most important factors for human society.' Extreme cold weather like the Polar Vortex conditions that caused the Hudson River in New York to freeze over in January 2014 have been growing more frequent in the past thirty years, according to new research . Heatwaves see sunseekers flock to the beach but they  also bring high death tolls as some struggle to cope . The IPCC has predicted that few areas will be left untouched by the impacts of climate change, which they say will include increasing levels of extreme weather events such as heatwaves and snow storms . He added that the study could help to explain the 'pause' in global warming since 1998 that was reported by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change last year. The new study showed that while warming continued in most parts of the planet, it was offset by a strong cooling during the winter months in the Northern Hemisphere. Prof Robeson said: 'There really hasn't been a pause in global warming. There has been a pause in Northern Hemisphere winter warming.' It comes after separate research, published in the journal Nature Climate Change, found that the chances of heatwaves in Europe have increased in the past decade. The likelihood of Extreme heatwaves, such as the one in 2003,  have also increased tenfold, from being a one in 1,000 year event to occurring around once in a century. By the 2040s, such extreme heatwaves could happen every other year if greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise, the researchers at the Met Office claimed. The summer heatwave in 2003 killed thousands of people as temperatures soared far higher than those seen in previous years. This map shows the temperature difference in 2003 compared to 2000, 2001, 2002 and 2004 . Temperature data gathered by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration shows that 2014 has already been the warmest on record for some parts of the world, including much of Europe .","University of East Anglia found heatwaves are becoming more frequent .

"'Killer': Sylvia Majewska, 65, is accused of killing her son and then fatally beating his baby daughter . A 'controlling' mother killed her adult son with a boxcutter then fatally beat his seven-month-old daughter because she believed they would be better off dead, police have said. Sylvia Majewska, 65, was arraigned in her hospital room on Monday. After the murders at her Oxford Township, Michigan home on November 23, she had tried to take her life by slicing her arms. Daryne Gailey, 29, who had learning disabilities and suffered seizures,  and his seven-month-old daughter, Charley Hendrick, were found dead by authorities carrying out a welfare check after Gailey failed to return the little girl to her mother. They found Charley tucked up in her crib, dead from blunt force trauma to the head, and discovered her father in the bathroom with a deep laceration from a boxcutter to his neck. The baby's body was found by deputies 'dressed and tucked away like it was going to sleep – very sad,' Oakland County Sheriff Michael Bouchard said, the Detroit Press reported. Majewska was on the couch with her arms slit and was 'bleeding into a bucket', Bouchard said. The box cutter was nearby. Oakland County authorities believe that Majewska attacked her son, who took medication before bed, in his sleep and then beat her granddaughter before slashing her arms. Bouchard said Majewska 'came to the conclusion that the son and the child would be better off if they weren't alive'. Murdered: Daryne Gailey, 29, who had learning disabilities and suffered seizures, and his seven-month-old daughter, Charley Hendrick, were found killed inside his mother's home on November 23 . Loss: Baby Charley, left and right with her mother Amanda, was found tucked up in her crib after she died . Split: The couple were married for just six months before they split. Gailey's mother filed his paperwork . Bouchard said investigators found several handwritten notes and other documents in the case. They found a new baby seat with a receipt, suggesting Majewska was planning to return it, police said. Authorities added that she was apparently a controlling mother to her mentally impaired son. 'We certainly have information that she was an angry woman and a controlling woman,' he said, citing surveillance video showing the mother and son's interaction inside a store before the murders. 'She was very much in charge, berating him, in that encounter in the store,' he said. Following the deaths, it emerged that Gailey had filed for divorce only six months after his August 2013 wedding to Charley's mother, Amanda Gailey. The divorce was finalized three weeks before the death. And more recently, Majewska had filed for a protection order on her son's behalf against his ex, although it was lifted in July, the Free Press reported. It is not clear why it was lifted. 'Controlling': Majewska also accused Amanda of acting violently towards her son, which she has denied . Scene: Authorities found the bodies after Gailey failed to return his daughter to her mother in November . In the protection order, Majewska claimed that Amanda Gailey had been diagnosed with bipolar disorder and had kicked him in the groin and thrown a cell phone at him, according to court records. Gailey has denied the allegations. Majewska, who was her son's guardian due to his learning disabilities, sought to get her son's marriage annulled in January, saying he did not have the understanding to marry. The following month, the baby was born and Amanda Gailey was given full and legal custody of the baby girl. Daryne Gailey was allowed to see his daughter every other Friday with his mother present. Gailey had worked as a clerk at a Kroger grocery store in Lake Orion for 15 years, employees said. They told the Free Press that he 'had a big heart'.","Sylvia Majewska 'sliced her son's neck with a boxcutter, beat her granddaughter to death and then tried to take her own life in November'

"Princess Beatrice has been  earning $30,000 a year while working as an intern at Sony, according to information leaked after the company was hacked. Among the data released last week, which included Brad Pitt's phone number, were the pay details of around 6,000 of the company's staff. One staff member is listed as 'York, Beatrice', which is thought to be a reference to the Princess who the daughter of Prince Andrew, Duke of York, and is sixth in line to the throne. Her job title is listed as intermediate production coordinator, and her home address is recorded as being Windsor, Berkshire. Scroll down for video . Princess Beatrice, pictured at this summer's Epsom Derby, is being paid $30,000 a year (£19,500) to work as an intern at Sony, according to pay information released by hackers last week . Beatrice has been working as an intern at Sony Pictures since the beginning of the year after quitting her job at an investment capital firm and following a period travelling around the globe with her boyfriend . The start date released by the hackers also seems to match up with when Beatrice was reported to have began working for the company at the beginning of the year. A spokesman for the Palace refused to comment on the data, saying only that Princess Beatrice works in the business sector. The Times reported that she remains employed by Sony Pictures. During the hack last Monday, sensitive medical files, email exchanges, pay details and other private information about staff were stolen. Princess Beatrice, who is the sixth in line to the throne, took up an internship at Sony Pictures at the beginning of the year. Although Beatrice has an HRH title she does not receive taxpayers' money. She does however undertake royal engagements on behalf of her grandmother the Queen from time to time, as she is keen to do her public service. She quit her job at investment capital firm Cabot Square Capital near Marble Arch last Summer and then travelled the world with her boyfriend Dave Clark. She was spotted aboard the yacht of billionaire steel tycoon Lakshmi Mittal in St Barts and also went to Aspen, America's chicest ski resort. Since returning to London, she has been working at the Sony Pictures Television at its London headquarters in Golden Square. Stars who have allegedly been hacked include actor Sylvester Stallone, best known for playing Rocky Balboa . Cars enter Sony Pictures Entertainment headquarters in Culver City, California. The company is still conducting an internal investigation on the hack . The hacking group calling itself Guardians of Peace began its attack last Monday, putting almost every one of the film studio's computers out of action. Some reports said several computers of Sony employees displayed a picture of a skeleton, threatening to release large amounts of data from the company. The latest revelations suggest that 47,000 Social Security numbers have been leaked. This allegedly includes stars such as  director Judd Apatow and actors Rebel Wilson and Sylvester Stallone. The leaked numbers belong to both past and current employees. Sony workers saw a message appear on computer screens saying 'Hacked by #GOP' - understood to be the initials of a group called Guardians of Peace which has been linked to North Korea . This comes in the wake of the salaries of Michael Lynton, the CEO of Sony Pictures Entertainment and Amy Pascal, the co-chairman of the company, being published. Both were revealed to be making a $3million annual salary. The hackers also uploaded five yet-to-be-released films to file-sharing websites, including the Brad Pitt film Fury, still in cinemas, and Annie, the much-anticipated remake set for a December 19 release. The early leak of films is considered, by the film industry, to have a devastating effect on the potential success of a title. The company has been trying to take the videos off the internet with cease-and-desist orders. The files infiltrated by the hackers included a script for an unreleased pilot written by Breaking Bad creator Vince Gilligan as well as 'email exchanges with employees regarding specific medical treatments they are undergoing, while one disciplinary letter details a manager's romantic relationship and business travel history with a subordinate.' The leaked information even includes an email about the breastfeeding diet of a senior executive. Pay information for more than 31,000 employees at Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu Ltd, a financial firm hired by Sony, were taken in the hack as well. Seth Rogen took home $8.4million working on The Interview, compared to the $6.5million his co-star James Franco made (left), according to information revealed in the recent cyber attack on Sony . Sources close to the internal investigation of the hack at Sony say they believe a North Korean group is behind the attack. Officials in North Korea previously threatened action . The suggested motivation for a hack from North Korea, commentators said, had been the country's anger at an upcoming Sony film, The Interview. In the film, set for release at Christmas, Seth Rogen and James Franco play two reporters who have been granted an audience with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. The CIA then enlists the pair to assassinate him. North Korea said the film was 'the most undisguised sponsoring of terrorism as well as a war action'. The country's UN envoy Ja Song-Nam said there would be a 'merciless response' if the film was not cancelled. However, the diplomat quoted by Voice of America - who asked to remain anonymous - dismissed reports his country had been involved in the attack on Sony. 'Linking [North Korea] to the Sony hacking is another fabrication targeting the country,' he told the broadcaster. 'My country publicly declared that it would follow international norms banning hacking and piracy.' Earlier this week, a separate North Korean official gave a more ambiguous response, saying: 'Wait and see,' in response to a question about the attack. Sony has yet to officially name North Korea as the source of the cyber attack, but sources close to the internal investigation spoke out yesterday to say they believe a group known as DarkSeoul is to blame.","Princess Beatrice took up an internship at Sony Pictures earlier this year .

"They may be on the naughty list but these pint-sized princesses are determined to teach a sexist Santa Claus about women's rights. The young girls caused a stir earlier this year with a video highlighting sexism against women, and in the Potty Mouth Princesses' latest film they're back to promote equal pay. Dressed in their finest fancy dress, the group of American actresses first brought attention to themselves with their video Things More Offensive Than The Word F***. Scroll down for video . In their latest video The Potty Mouth Princesses use Christmas to discuss the injustice of the gender pay gap . They turned the air blue as they effed and blinded about women's issues asking, what is more offensive, a little girl saying 'f***' or the inequality that today's women face? This was followed up with a second video highlighting the likelihood that their generation would suffer at the hands of domestic violence. Now in their festive film the princesses ask, 'What if Santa was sexist?' in a bid to expose the shocking truth of the gender pay gap. The video opens as it aims to go on - with a swear word three seconds in. MailOnline has bleeped out the offending words but has kept the rest of the video intact. The opening scenes sees little boys and girls opening their Christmas gifts however where boys get skateboards and footballs the girls receive broken versions of the toys. One of the young ladies then asks: 'How sh***y would it be if Santa was as sexist as society?' and after opening their inferior gifts the girls say 'What the f***, Santa? This is sexist bull****.' In the opening scene, boys and girls open their gifts from Santa only to find the girls' gifts are somewhat inferior, a direct comparison to the unequal pay that many women still receive in the workplace . In the video Father Christmas points out that on average women get paid 23 per cent less than men . What is more shocking than primary school children using the 'F' word is the sobering statistics that Father Christmas reveals to the angry princesses. Comparing the girls' smaller presents to wage slips, Santa says: 'This is how society pays women. Get used to that. Women are paid 23 per cent less with less opportunity to work. Girls should accept it.' This fact is not taken lightly and one of the girls snaps back at Santa, calling him a 'sexist jerk'. One of the  girls reacts to the fact that women who get As are paid as much as men who received Cs at school . Santa continues to point out that shockingly this pay gap is nothing to do with a lack of skill and that even women who are more talented than their male peers will still receive a significant wage cut. 'Women who get As are paid as much as guys who get Cs in class' he points out. In reaction to this the young girls passionately express their dissatisfaction with the salary system. 'It seems women are valued less for their brains and more for the shape of their ass,' one says. 'And Grinch-like politicians are here to ruin our holiday,' another adds. One festive princess points out  that not one of the US's republican politicians voted for equal pay . The girls discuss the fact that so many women are now valued for their looks over their brains . One of the seasonally dressed girls adds that shockingly, 'not one f***ing Scrooge republican voted for equal pay.' Being Father Christmas it comes as no surprise that all of this swearing isn't going down well when it comes to getting on his nice list. 'The naughty use of the ""F"" word gets me bent out of joint' says the festive figure, but the girls are quick to point out that being polite has not got their previous generations any closer to equality. The young ladies point out that generations before them haven't got anywhere from being quiet and polite . 'Well for decades nice women have been ignored making this point,' responds one of the princess posse. 'So if you won't stop society from treating us like b****es and ho ho hos it won't just be your f***ing reindeer who has a red nose.' They continue their point with a festive theme as one of the princesses holds up two baubles and says: 'To get treated equally we shouldn't need balls.' When Santa asks what young girls want to find under the tree this Christmas the girls say: 'How about the f***ing long overdue gift of equality?' At this stage Santa is entirely convinced and agrees, 'Yeah, I'm totally f***ing down with that.' The girls swearing may be shocking but it is sure to capture the audience's attention with the original video attracting over a million views on YouTube and their latest currently having almost 10,000. The film's director Luke Montgomery said of his domestic violence video that he understands it is shocking and could be considered offensive but says that the statistics themselves are the really offensive issue. 'Society needs to clean up its act,' he told the Design Taxi site. 'I'd rather see these girls in abuse make-up speaking out today so when they are older maybe less women will have those injuries in real life. 'In a culture that abuses women daily with things like paying them less than men for the exact same work, is it any surprise that so many men think they can abuse women too?'

"A Brazilian model who shot to fame after winning Miss Bumbum 2014 has had surgery to return her to being a virgin so she can once again enjoy her first time with 'someone special'. Earlier this year, Indianara Carvalho, 22, triumphed in Brazil's annual bottom beauty contest, which sees 27 women - one from each state - complete to prove their backside is best. Miss Carvalho's new look, which she hopes will garner the controversial Bumbum title 'some respect', will be revealed in racy new pictures set to be released on Christmas Day. Scroll down for video . Like a virgin: Indianara Carvalho, aka Miss Bumbum 2014, has surgically restored her virginity . The model, who says she wants to use her newly virginal status to find love, had 'vaginal rejuvenation surgery' which includes a hymenoplasty. The procedure, which is not available in the UK, can be done by  using surgical gel to create a new hymen that lasts a few days before dissolving or more permanently by using a flap of skin cut from the vaginal wall. Women undergoing the latter treatment must abstain from sex for at least three months after undergoing the procedure. Speaking about her surgical plans, Miss Carvalho said: 'I wanted to undergo surgery to reconstruct my virginity before I have new photographs done. 'I wouldn't feel good about appearing naked if I wasn't exactly as I came into the world if you know what I mean. Winner: Miss Carvalho became the winner of the annual Miss Bumbum contest earlier this year . Controversial: The event, which has been running for four years, has been beset by bribery allegations . Respect: Miss Carvalho says she hopes her dramatic move will encourage people to respect the winners . 'I think I also want to give a bit of respect and new concept to the Miss Bum Bum title by being a virgin.' Although the model recently flew to the beach resort of Punta Cana to take part in a risque bikini shoot, her new post-surgery photos will be kept under wraps until Christmas. Miss Bum Bum, which began four years ago and has several spin-offs, is an annual institution in its native Brazil, although not always without controversy. The 2014 contest was marred by scandal after it was alleged  that Miss Carvalho had bribed the judges with over £70,000  in cash to make sure she won. Claudia Alende, better known as the Brazilian 'Megan Fox', won second place in the competition even though she was a clear favourite among the audience. The previous year, a pair of contestants, Mari Sousa, 25, and Eliana Amaral, 24, were also accused of paying bribes, although the 2013 title was eventually won by Dai Macedo. Grand unveiling: Photos of a post-surgery Miss Carvalho will be unveiled on Christmas Day .

"Tesco has launched an investigation after one of its stores committed a huge blunder by selling copies of Roy Keane's autobiography three days early. The revealing book, which contains details about Keane's shock sacking by Manchester United, and a drink-fuelled fight with Peter Schmeichel, was due to go on sale on Thursday. Roy Keane's autobiography The Second Half was supposed to be released on Thursday . Keane opens up about his departure from Manchester United as well as his thoughts on Sir Alex Ferguson . Tesco have launched an investigation to find out why the book was put on sale three days early in Burnage . But publishers Weidenfeld & Nicolson was left stunned when a Tesco store in Burnage, Manchester, put copies of The Second Half on its shelves on Monday morning. A big publicity launch has been scheduled for the original release day in Dublin, but contents of the book have already been published online. 'A copy of Roy Keane's book was sold in error at our Burnage store,' a Tesco statement read. 'Colleagues are currently investigating how this happened.' The supermarket removed the books from its shelves shortly after realising it had made an error. The former Republic of Ireland midfielder, now assistant manager at Aston Villa, hit the headlines for writing about the tackle that ended Alf-Inge Haaland's career in his first book, which was published 12 years ago. And his latest autobiography appears to be just as revealing, with details about his departure from United among a series of fascinating tales from the 43-year-old former Nottingham Forest player.

"Mike Shallcross realised - to his horror - that his daily, social drinking was putting him at increased risk of alcohol-related liver disease. He is now trying to have two consecutive 'dry' days each week . Hello my name is Mike, and I'm the sort of guy who could die from liver disease. I'm not an alcoholic: the seldom-seen-anymore friend fishing on Facebook to be congratulated on his dry anniversary. I'm not the divorcé at your work who lurches back from lunch with a mouthful of Smints, and gets called into the boss's office the morning after the Christmas party. Nor the guy on your bus this morning with an open can of electric soup, chemical BO and no particular place to go (why do these folks never have a lie-in?). No, I'm none of those people. But I am the sort of guy who could die from liver disease. And possibly so are you. The reason? I just love a drink. I don't self-medicate or blot out, I drink to enhance life. I scoff at talk like 'I don't like the taste' or 'It's empty calories'. I love that thirst-shattering beer at the end of the working day, the flavoursome explosion of a glass of red with a meal, the bite of a fine dark rum sipped while contemplating a knotty problem. Alcohol isn't a crutch for me, it's a pogo stick. I suppose some might take issue with my phrase 'a drink'. A few years ago at an office drinks do I was, er, 'refreshing my glass' when a lippy young intern remarked: 'Hoovering up are we Shallcross?' Lest anyone think that gross impertinence is a career impediment at Men's Health, I should point out that he is now our Associate Style Editor. But that phrase made me realise I could slip into a dangerous category identified by Andrew Langford, chief executive of the British Liver Trust, as he surveys the – ironically sobering – statistic of a 25 per cent rise in alcohol-related liver disease deaths in the last decade. 'At the moment liver disease is the 5th biggest killer in the UK. If we don't do anything about it by 2025 it will almost certainly be one of the top two, it is a major epidemic. 'The majority of people who die of alcohol-related liver disease are not alcoholics. They drink every day or most days - not getting slaughtered, but just drinking that bit too much. Scroll down for video . If you are going to drink, you must take two to three consecutive days off every week to give your liver a chance to rejuvenate – regardless of how much you're drinking, say experts from the British Liver Trust . 'Instead of having a glass of wine or a beer after work they're having two or three. Just topping up every day and never giving their liver a rest.' Does that make them alcoholics, heavy drinkers, chronic drinkers or just normal? We can sit here and split hairs all day, but ultimately my opinion, your opinion, even the finger-wagging of your GP doesn't matter. They are not categories your liver recognises. It doesn't care whether you necked those five pints with a crowd of mates to wet a baby's head, or whether you drank them alone to numb the pain of an argument. It's not about judgements, just biology. And liver disease can develop slowly, but its endgame can be apocalyptic. It's not a question of lying in hospital with yellow skin and a glorified tummy ache. Besides its function of filtering out the toxins from drink and drugs, the organ is also vital for hormone balance, blood clotting, and protecting certain parts of the body from infection. Remove its protection, and things will start going to shit very rapidly. Believe me, you don't want to see what happens to brain function when the liver can no longer dispose of bilirubin, a by-product of dead blood cells. There are other culprits when it comes to liver disease: obesity is a factor, as is the prevalence of viral hepatitis and, to some little extent, steroid abuse. But booze is drawing most fire for the moment. 'In the last 35 years we've allowed alcohol to become a commodity,' says Mr Langford. Your liver is the size of: a. An iPhone b. A grapefruit c. A rugby ball . Answer: C - a rugby ball . It is surprisingly large. It's the second largest organ (after your skin) weighs 1.3kg and at any one time will contain 10 per cent of the blood in your body . Which of the following is an early sign of liver disease? a. An aching liver b. Floating faeces c. Dark urine . Answer: B&C - Floating faeces and dark urine . 'The liver doesn't have any nerve endings so if it gets damaged there won't be any be any pain,' says Andrew Langford, of the British Liver Trust. 'If your urine is darker on a regular basis, even when you're hydrated, or if you regularly have floating poo, that can be a sign your liver isn't absorbing fat.' True or false: fatty liver disease is incurable . False. The liver is a resilient organ, and fatty liver disease, which can be diagnosed with a blood test, is reversible with two weeks' abstinence. Watch your step though, move onto either of the next two steps of ARLD, alcoholic  patitis or cirrhosis, and you will have to give up alcohol permanently to save your life. 'In the 70s it would have been fairly unusual for my mum to have had alcohol in her shopping, whereas now a bottle of wine goes into the basket along with the milk, eggs and bread.' You can see how it works. Not so many years ago, drinkers comprised discrete guilds. Some people propped up the saloon bar, others drank wine or spirits at home, purchased by the single bottle. Now we can enjoy back-to-back football in pubs that once shut on Sunday afternoons before heading home to tuck into that wine club case of mixed reds (a product perfectly balanced in the middle-class chasm between aspiration and fear – we talk eruditely about Italian grape varieties while worrying about how quickly that rack is emptying itself). The article appears in this month's issue of Men's Health, on sale now . Our any time, any place, anywhere attitude to booze puts everyone at risk. So what is our strategy. Assuming that complete abstinence is out, you could try a month off – a dry January for example. Mr Langford welcomes this with some qualification. 'Anything that gets people to look at their drinking is a good idea,' he says. 'But you're wasting your time if you go back to old habits for the other 11 months.' Langford has a simple prescription: 'If you are going to drink, you must take two to three consecutive days off every week to give your liver a chance to rejuvenate – regardless of how much you're drinking,' he says. 'The important word here is 'consecutive'. It needs at least 48 hours to start repairing itself.' To this end the BLT has just brought out an app, Spruce, which helps you stick to your dry days. The Imperial War Museum recently exhibited a rare example of a WW1 propaganda poster which made sense. 'Don't Take Alcoholic Drinks on Mondays', it exhorted, a gesture of solidarity with 'the great sacrifices freely made by our sailors and soldiers'. I'm going to go one better, and stick to grapefruit juice on Mondays and Tuesdays, in solidarity with a truly long-suffering organ. After all, we've all been putting this guy through a lot.

"A British female sporting team are celebrating international victory as they take home the World Cup for Elephant polo . Samantha Prentice, 45, from Haddington, East Lothian scored all 27 goals and secured a triumph for her team, the Tigresses Polo, at the annual tournament in Nepal last week. The unusual game involves two teams of up to four players sitting on top of the enormous animals, and is played in a similar manner to regular polo. Samantha Prentice (second left) celebrates winning the World Cup for Elephant Polo with her team mates Tigresses Polo . To keep the sport fair, teams swap elephants at half time to ensure victory does not come down to who has the better elephant. Eco-tourism travel consultant Samantha has already made a name for herself in the sport after she came third in 2013 and second in 2012. However, Samantha had not yet made it to championship status and said that she was over the moon to finally have triumphed. Elephant Polo works under similar rules as the original game however it sees players swap horses to ride elephants . 'I've been playing for 15 years now and I'm just ecstatic. I had no idea how good it felt to be a champion until I became one. I have to keep pinching myself. 'We had gotten so close in recent years and it's great to finally win a tournament. We're very competitive but are very nice about it. 'I was very fortunate to play with such a good bunch of ladies that would get the ball to me as often as they could.' Samantha first discovered the sport while on a gap year to Nepal in the 80s . Samantha added that living in Scotland provided some logistical issues when it came to getting practice in for matches. 'Unfortunately, we don't have an elephant at home so it is quite difficult to train in the gaps between playing but I'd say it's important to keep fit. 'I play quite a lot of tennis and golf and find that the skills in those sports are very transferable. 'It's kind of like riding a bike, once you know how to ride an elephant that never leaves you.' Samantha had already made a name for herself in the sport after she had come third in 2013 and second in 2012 . Samantha first discovered the game around thirty years ago in Nepal and has since developed it into a full time hobby. 'I first heard of the sport in the 80s when I was working in Nepal on a gap year but didn't really get into it until the turn of the century. 'My husband Peter has played and won in the past so it's particularly sweet to have bragging rights over him this time around.' Scottish players have been dominant since the sport was invented in 1983 as teams have been successful 11 times with a Scot on their side and being Scottish herself Samantha does not break the tradition. Nepal has registered elephant polo as an Olympic sport which means that if Kathmandu were to ever host the Olympics then elephant polo would be played on an exhibition basis. Samantha's husband Peter, 53, is the Chairman of the World Elephant Polo Association and a former world champion. He had also played in the championships and said although he had not been met by the same victory as his wife he was very pleased for her. 'Of course I'm disappointed to have lost but once my team were knocked out I wanted Samantha to win.' Peter added that the Scottish penchant for another club-based game might explain their success in the exotic sport. 'I think Scotland is actually quite well placed to produce great elephant polo players as the home of golf since a lot of the skills are transferable. 'Experience counts for a lot in this sport and I've been playing for 28 years now and don't really practice until I'm back on an elephant. 'Another reason that Scots might be so good at it is that during the day you play hard then at night party harder.' The sport has raised over £600,000 for elephant welfare charities and the elephants competing in the world cup remain in their natural environment. The defending players must be 15 metres from the spot . Source: World Elephant Polo Asssociation .","Samantha Prentice scored 27 goals and secured first place victory at the games in Nepal .

"Prince Charles is famous for his love of plants but it seems the Queen loves flowers just as much as her eldest son. According to Alan Titchmarsh, the monarch adores her garden so much, she has a weekly posy cut and delivered to her on Monday mornings when she returns to Buckingham Palace from Windsor. The half-dozen blooms are taken from the palace gardens and are a gift from her gardeners, who like to show off the latest fruits of their labours. Keen gardener: The Queen, seen here with the Duke of Edinburgh, is a keen gardener . Weekly gift: The Queen is handed a posy by her gardeners every week so she can see what is in season . 'She has a little posy cut for her every Monday, which is placed on her desk when she gets back from Windsor,' said Titchmarsh. 'It will typically have six or seven different types of flowers from the garden to give her a little snapshot of what's looking good at that time.' Currently, that means honeysuckle, winter jasmine and blueberries, although the selection changes depending on the season. Titchmarsh made the revelations during an interview with the Radio Times to promote The Queen's Garden, a documentary about the Buckingham Palace grounds which is due to be screened on Christmas Day. The veteran gardener was given unfettered access to the Palace gardens for a year and was allowed to place cameras in trees in order to chart its progress through the year. The result is a rare snapshot of the Queen's 40-acre private gardens in all their glory - complete with 35 types of mulberry and a rare white helleborine orchid. Insider: Alan Titchmarsh is behind a new documentary that explores the Buckingham Palace grounds . Sprawling: The Buckingham Palace gardens cover 40 acres and are home to 35 species of mulberry bush . Also captured on the motion sensing cameras is the local wildlife, among them foxes and hedgehogs, although the monarch hardly features at all. That, explains Titchmarsh, is because the royal gardeners are enormously protective of their employer. 'The gardeners are quite cagey [about] talking about what the Queen likes,' he says. 'But what becomes quite evident is she loves what we would call English cottage garden flowers - unostentatious flowers, not things that are too exotic.' Not, however, that the Queen is shy of making her feelings on planting clear. 'If it's a quick replanting of a bed, they wouldn't bother her much with that,' says Tichmarsh. 'But she is very much involved with major changes. 'The summer garden parties were always in July but now they have been moved earlier to June, that means adjusting the planting scheme to make the borders brighter earlier. 'She would be consulted about that sort of thing.' Wildlife: Along with foxes and hedgehogs, Buckingham Palace is also home to several hives of honeybees .

"If you assumed the dirty grease from your Sunday roast was useless, think again - it could soon be making you a cup of tea. Scientists are on a mission to conquer the giant 'fatbergs' clogging Britain's sewers by generating electricity from used cooking oil. So-called 'fat vats' - resembling a kitchen-top compost bin - have been handed out to residents of Bradford, West Yorkshire, in a trial which would be rolled out to thousands of homes. Scroll down for video . Fat vat: Plastic tubs have been issued across Bradford, West Yorkshire, so people can collect oil to be turned into waste power - and stop it turning into giant fatbergs. Sra Hussain, 19 (pictured) is part of the trial . Fancy a cuppa? A water firm hopes these 'fatbergs' in the sewers of Bradford, West Yorkshire, will soon be a thing of the past. A five-litre 'fat vat' filled by just one house would provide enough power for 1,250 cups of tea . Appetising: The water firm released revolting photos of its blocked sewers to stop people pouring oil away . The 85 households will pour their leftover cooking oil, fat and grease into the five-litre plastic tubs which will be collected fortnightly by their local water firm. Yorkshire Water will then take the samples to a centre near Leeds run by the renewable energy firm called Living Fuels, where they will be converted into bio-electricity. It is claimed 1,000 litres of oil - weighing about a tonne - would generate enough electricity to power an average home for a year. That is enough to make 250,000 cups of tea or power a microwave for 3,000 hours - the equivalent of 125 days' continual use. Just one of the household vats would provide enough energy to boil the kettle 1,250 times. The system works by pumping oil into 'settling tanks', where it is left for two to five weeks to let impurities settle to the bottom where they can be removed. Trial: The system is beginning with 85 homes and could be expanded by politicians, volunteers and water bosses (pictured at Bradford's Karmand Community Centre) Blockage: The sewers of Bradford Moor, where the trial is taking place, have been obstructed 80 times . Pipe: Water firms warn even liquid fat like cooking oil can solidify and cause problems down the drain . The lighter, purer oil is then filtered and used in combined heat and power stations, where it produces heat for homes and electricity which can be used on the National Grid. It comes after warnings by water engineers that our love of fatty food is causing dangerous blockages in Britain's sewers. Last summer a 15-ton fatberg the size of a bus was found in sewers under Kingston, south west London, after resident complained they couldn't flush their toilets. The revolting mass of congealed fat and wet wipes took three weeks to remove and was said to be days from forcing raw sewage out of manhole covers across Kingston. Water firms have warned that even liquid fat like cooking oil can solidify and cause problems once it goes down the drain. A Yorkshire Water spokesman said 110,000 tonnes of used . cooking oil is thrown away by British households every year, enough to provide carbon-neutral power to 110,000 homes. Gross: This fatberg the size of a bus was found last summer under the streets of Kingston, London . The company spent £2.3million improving the region's sewers last year to modernise them and prevent blockages. The scheme is being rolled out in 85 homes in co-ordination with the Karmand Community Centre in Bradford Moor. The area has been hit particularly badly by sewer blockages with 80 in the last year. The water firm said the main cause was identified as cooking oils being poured down people's sinks, which later solidify in sewers. Yorkshire Water technician Duncan Woodhead said: 'A lot of people don't realise the damage this can do because these liquids solidify when they get down to the sewers and that can cause blockages. 'We are all now looking forward to experiencing the benefits that this new trial will be.'","Kitchen-top plastic tubs are being trialled across Bradford, West Yorkshire .

"A two-month-old Indian baby girl was branded with a hot knife by a local healer attempting to cure her pneumonia. Shivani Seheriya had caught the life-threatening infection last month. In desperation, her poverty-stricken mother turned to her village tantric, a traditional therapist used in rural India, for help. Somvati Seheriya, 22, had lost her first daughter to pneumonia a year earlier, and had refused to take her to see the healer at the time. After this, she was convinced he could cure her newborn baby. Somvati Seheriya, 22, took her two -month-old daughter Shivani to a local healer to treat her pneumonia. He burnt her over 40 times with a hot knife, leaving her with a fever and needing to be rushed to hospital . Branding is a traditional practice in India where the skin is burnt with a hot iron rod or other metallic object to treat various medical conditions. It is said to be a cure for common diseases like malaria, jaundice, meningitis and convulsions. It is thought to be centuries old, and has attained a sort of religious sanctity. This practice is still very much seen in villages in India, according to a study published in the Journal of Tropical Gastroentrology. Mrs Seheriya and her husband Giru, 23, from Sheopur, in Madhya Pradesh, central India, took Shivani to the healer on December 2nd. He then burnt the child's abdomen with the hot knife over 40 times, convinced it would cure her illness. However, Shivani's situation only got worse. After she returned home she developed severe fever. Desperately worried, Mrs Seheriya and her husband rushed Shivani to the district government hospital where, after treating her for the burns and pneumonia, doctors late found she was suffering from Ventricular Septal Defect. This is a condition where the wall between the two a chambers of the heart does not form, leaving a hole. Dr Gobind Singh, the surgeon and orthopedic specialist who treated Shivani, said: 'When Shivani was brought into the hospital her condition was very bad. 'She was gravely ill and had trouble breathing. Her abdomen was badly burnt and it was a sorry sight to see a little baby suffering so badly.' Medical stuff kept Shivani on a machine called a nebulizer, that administers drugs, and gave her medicine. 'By God's grace Shivani's condition improved by the next day and she was even able to breastfeed,' Dr Singh continued. Mrs Seheriya took her daughter to the local district hospital, where doctors treated the burns and the pneumonia. They also discovered Shivani had a condition which left her with a hole in her heart . 'While pneumonia is common among newborns, unfortunately, the baby girl also suffered from Ventricular Septal Defect, which are holes in the heart. 'We have advised the parents to take her to a medical college where she can be treated by specialists, free of charge.' Shivani and Giru hail from a primitive tribal community, called Seheriyas, in Madhya Pradesh. They still believe in tantric or local healers for their medical problems, who carry out branding as a common treatment. Dr Singh said branding is prevalent in remote villages dominated by Seheriyas and though painful, people willingly go for it because they have little or no faith in medical doctors. He said he sees two or three cases of branded patients every year. He said: 'It is disturbing that tribal families still believe they would be cured with burns to their bodies. 'But I cannot blame them. They are illiterate and not informed about medical science, they don't understand. 'When we get such cases, we try to educate the parents, and explain the importance of bringing their children to us for better treatment.' The practice of branding is common in rural communities in India, such as in Sheopur, Madhya Pradesh, central India (pictured) Branding is a traditional practice in India the skin is burnt with a hot iron rod or other metallic object to treat various medical conditions. It is said to be a cure for common diseases like malaria, jaundice, meningitis and convulsions. It is thought to be centuries old, and has attained a sort of religious sanctity and began to be associated with local deities. This practice is still very much seen in villages in India. Various body parts are branded for different diseases: the abdomen for malaria and jaundice, the neck or the forehead for meningitis and the wrist for convulsions. The red rod is just one of the instruments used, others include burning ropes and metal rings. These ancient methods are crude and inhumane, causing the treatment to be more unbearable than the original complaint and even carrying the risk of complications. These  include acute infection, transmission of blood-borne pathogens, allergic reactions, and complications which arise from third-degree burns. The practice of putting saliva, ash or herbal paste on the burn wounds adds to the disease.

"One type of medication prescribed for Parkinson's increases the risk of compulsive behaviours . A drug company has offered a settlement to patients who claim they became addicted to gambling and sex after taking medication to treat Parkinson's disease. Pfizer has confirmed it has proposed the settlement after class action was taken by 150 patients. They claim they were not warned of the side effects. A hearing had been scheduled in the Federal Court of Australia next year, the Guardian reported. But the settlement offered is now set to be considered by the court, who will decide whether to agree it. A Pfizer spokeswoman said: 'On that basis, Pfizer Australia is unable to make any further comment at this time.' A study published earlier this year found drugs commonly prescribed to treat Parkinson's disease increase the risk of behaviours such as sex addiction, compulsive shopping and gambling. Parkinson’s is a degenerative condition that occurs when nerve cells in the brain die, causing a lack of the chemical dopamine. This, in turn, interferes with movement and co-ordination. The disease is incurable - the aim of treatment is to alleviate the symptoms. There are two types of medication: ‘levodopa’ drugs, used since the Sixties, and ‘dopamine agonists’, introduced 12 years ago. Both attempt to replace the missing dopamine, but the levodopa group restores it artificially, while dopamine agonists mimic its role by stimulating nerve cells. Impulsive and compulsive behaviour is a known side-effect of both types of medication, although it’s more common with dopamine agonists. Up to 14 per cent of patients develop changes in behaviour. These problems can be extensions of existing traits - for example someone who has always enjoyed a flutter might develop more of a gambling problem. In a new study, researchers found dopamine agonist drugs were made patients more likely to indulge in pathological gambling, hypersexuality and compulsive shopping. Usually these habits disappear once patients stop taking the medication. Those affected find themselves trapped in an almost impossible situation: their compulsions are caused by medication, but they can’t stop taking it because it would leave them unable to function physically. The Parkinson’s Disease Foundation says in one earlier study, dopamine agonists were linked with compulsive behaviours in up to 14 per cent of patients. The drugs increase the risk of behaviours such as compulsive shopping, sex addiction and gambling . While these side effects have been known for around a decade, researchers at the Institute for Safe Medication Practices in Alexandria, Virginia, wanted to investigate the link further. Lead author Thomas J. Moore and his team analysed 2.7 million serious drug side effects reported in between 2003 and 2012 in the U.S. and 21 other countries. They identified 1,580 impulse control disorder events - 710 linked to dopamine agonist drugs and 870 associated with other drugs. The dopamine agonists were most often prescribed for Parkinson’s disease but were also sometimes prescribed for restless leg syndrome. Parkinson’s is a degenerative condition that occurs when nerve cells in the brain die, causing a lack of the chemical dopamine. This, in turn, interferes with movement and co-ordination. The disease is incurable - the aim of treatment is to alleviate the symptoms. There are two types of medication: ‘levodopa’ drugs, used since the Sixties, and ‘dopamine agonists’, introduced 12 years ago.

Impulsive and compulsive behaviour is a known side-effect of both types of medication, although it’s more common with dopamine agonists. Up to 14 per cent of patients develop changes in behaviour. Dopamine agonist drugs were 277 times more likely to result in a report of specific impulse control symptoms than other drugs, Mr Moore told Reuters Health. 'This tells you that reports associating a drug with pathological gambling or hypersexuality are extremely rare, except for this group of drugs,' he said. The actual risk could in fact be higher, since the data relies on official reports of drug side effects, added Joshua J. Gagne, of Brigham and Women’s Hospital and Harvard Medical School in Boston. The study was published in JAMA Internal Medicine. Daiga Heisters, of Parkinson’s UK, said: ‘A significant minority of those taking dopamine medication find they have problems with compulsive behaviour. ‘Every individual reacts differently to Parkinson’s drugs. 'By talking with their specialist, they can look at altering the dose or drug, and side-effects can be alleviated or even eliminated. ‘It’s important doctors make their patients aware this can happen and monitor them.’ The three main symptoms of Parkinson’s disease are tremor (involuntary shaking of particular parts of the body), slow movement and stiff and inflexible muscles. Other symptoms include depression, constipation, problems sleeping, loss of sense of smell and memory problems.","Pfizer Australia confirmed it has proposed a settlement after action was taken by 150 patients who claim they weren't warned of side effects .

"Louisa Manning, 22, asked a waiter to give her 'date' an old photo and letter. The note detailed jibes the bully made at school about her weight and mono-brow . For one Oxford University student, revenge was a dish best served cold. After nearly ten years of waiting, Louisa Manning last week got her own back on the bully who called her ‘manbeast’ as a teenager. The 22-year-old had been reunited with her former classmate at a university Christmas ball. She had undergone a stunning transformation in the intervening years – so much so that the young man apparently didn’t recognise her and asked her out to dinner. But Miss Manning – who was picked on at school because of her weight and appearance – did not show up. Instead, she asked a waiter to hand the man a photograph of her younger self accompanied by a note. The letter, which she later posted online, read: ‘Hey, so sorry I can’t join you tonight. ‘Remember year 8, when I was fat and you made fun of my weight? No? I do – I spent the following three years eating less than an apple a day. So I’ve decided to skip dinner. ‘Remember the monobrow you mocked? The hairy legs you were disgusted by? Remember how every day for three years, you and your friends called me manbeast?’ She added that he probably didn’t – or he wouldn’t have deemed her attractive enough to treat her ‘like a human being’. ‘I thought I’d send you this as a reminder,’ she said. ‘Next time you think of me, picture this photo, because she’s the one who just stood you up.’ Last night the post had already received more than 17,000 ‘Likes’ on the social networking site Facebook. One user commented: ‘You are a heroine. Thank you for standing up against bullying, the world needs more role models like you.’ Another wrote: ‘Nice work, you’re awesome. I was never a big bully but was someone who gave some kids some **** back in grade school.... I have since approached them to apologise for my behaviour back then. So don’t totally swear this guy off.. cheers!’ Twitter user Andrew Kay wrote to Miss Manning: ‘On behalf of everyone who has ever been bullied, well done for standing up and taking charge’. St Peter’s College student Miss Manning, who is from Cambridgeshire, later received a reply on Facebook from the man she stood up. It said: ‘Hey… For what it’s worth, I was actually here looking for a chance to meet up to make friends, not because you are very good looking. ‘I guess I had it coming though, and certainly don’t blame you for standing me up. The letter Louisa Manning wrote to a former bully who asked her out on a date, along with a picture of her as a school child . ‘I can’t change who I was 8 years ago, and I won’t insult your intelligence by pretending it didn’t happen, but I hope you believe me when I say I’m a different person now. ‘I can only apologise and wish you the very best. I guess I won’t hear from you again but I mean it when I say I hope you have every success you deserve.’ Speaking after the story spread around the world, Miss Manning said: ‘I think it’s crazy and quite overwhelming, I wasn’t expecting it to go this viral. ‘I think every tabloid ever has now printed something on me. I was pretty happy with Glamour . magazine though – I was listed hero of the week, alongside Prince Harry. Success.’ Do you know the man in this story, or are you him?

"London families are being warned not to pour Christmas dinner remains down the drain over the festive season - or face the prospect of clogging up sewers. Thames Water, the company responsible for public water supply and waste water treatment, has revealed that blockages in the sewer system rise by around 25 per cent at this time of year. And the main culprits identified are 'festive fatbergs' - or, the 'hideous concoction of turkey drippings, oil from your roast veg and fatty gravy'. Scroll down for video . Thames Water has pleaded with families to watch what goes down the drain this Christmas fearing blockages . Danny Brackley has been working in the sewers for four years and said they cost £12 million a year to repair . Mr Brackley said the biggest blockage he had to deal with was nine double-decker buses worth of cooking fat and wet wipes underneath Leicester Square in central London in 2010 . According to deputy chief sewer flusher Danny Brackley, London's sewers cost £12 million a year to repair. He said: ‘The biggest blockage I had to deal was nine double-decker buses worth of cooking fat and wet wipes underneath Leicester Square in 2010. We had to use pressure jetting to get rid of it - the smell is horrendous if you're not used to it. ‘When the fat congeals it takes the oxygen out of the atmosphere so we have to be really careful not to be poisoned, it also gives out nitrogen and methane gas.’ Mr Brackley, who is now starring in radio adverts to prevent sewer abuse, believes our diet is partly to blame. Mr Brackley said the smells in sewers can be 'horrendous' unless you are experienced with them . Mr Brackley, who is now starring in radio adverts to prevent sewer abuse, says people's diet is partly to blame . He explained that since the 1980s, and the rise of fast food, grease has become more of a problem. ‘Fat and wet wipes can build up right outside your front door, building up until the sewer blocks and raw sewage is spilling out over the road or even worse, up through toilets into their home,' he said. ‘To avoid this, you should wait for the cooking fat to cool, pour it into a container and put it in the bin.' Workers have previously found bullets, live hand grenades and half a Mini Cooper in London's sewer system . Debris: Mr Brackley never ceases to be amazed what can be found inside London's sewer system . He said: 'We regularly come across old coins or Second World War bullets and one of my colleagues once found a hand-grenade. We also once found half of a Mini Cooper car - we still can't work out how it got in there' Mr Brackley, 26, who has worked for Thames Water for four years, said he continues to be amazed by the variety and scope of his job. ‘The best thing about the job is seeing the incredible architecture of the sewers, much of it dates back to the 1960s but the worst thing is the way people abuse them and put the wrong things down there,' he said. ‘We regularly come across old coins or Second World War bullets and one of my colleagues once found a hand-grenade. ‘We also once found half of a Mini Cooper car - we still can't work out how it got in there.’ For more information, visit thameswater.co.uk/help-and-advice.

"Steven Gerrard struggled to make an impression as Liverpool were beaten 3-1 by West Ham on Saturday, leading to suggestions that age and fatigue is starting to catch up with the 34-year-old captain. The midfielder has played every minute of Liverpool's season so far and, judging by the statistics from the match at Upton Park, it's taking its toll. Gerrard surrendered possession on 14 occasions, very unlike him, and only Raheem Sterling (20) gave the ball away more in the Liverpool team. Steven Gerrard looked well short of his best form in Liverpool's 3-1 loss to West Ham on Saturday . Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers issues instructions to Gerrard from the sidelines at Upton Park . Steven Gerrard was poor against West Ham, as his stats from the game show. Is age finally catching up with Liverpool’s 34-year-old captain? 14 Gerrard lost the ball 14 times. Only Raheem Sterling (20) lost it more for Liverpool. 11 He misplaced 11 passes in the opposition half, more than any Liverpool player. 25% Gerrard won just 25 per cent of his duels, the worst percentage of any Liverpool player. Only six players in last year’s top six squads are older than Gerrard, and most now play bit-part roles. The former England midfielder also misplaced 11 passes in the opposition half, more than any other Liverpool player, and that resulted in a poor passing completion rate of 57.7 per cent in West Ham territory. He also won just 25 per cent of his duels, the worst percentage of any player in the team. Gerrard is pretty much unique in the Premier League for the amount of minutes he's expected to put in for his age and Brendan Rodgers will consider resting him for a game or two to restore him to somewhere near his best form. But that break of two or three games is out of the question. Gerrard should be nowhere near the midweek Capital One Cup tie with Middlesbrough but he'll be needed in Saturday's Merseyside derby against Everton. A tough trip to Basle in the Champions League then follows. The international break that follows Liverpool's home match with West Brom on October 4 can't come soon enough. His application can't be faulted, however. Gerrard ran 6.4 miles against West Ham, second only to his midfield partner Jordan Henderson, but his usual influence just wasn't there.

Having been away from European competition last season, Liverpool must now quickly reacquaint themselves with the punishing routine of playing Premier League at the weekend and Champions League on Tuesday or Wednesday. Despite the scoreline in east London, Rodgers insisted afterwards that wouldn't be a problem: 'It's a tiring competition, the Champions League, but we've earned the right to be in it and we also have to do well in the Premier League.

"The 45-year-old police officer-turned-neo Nazi activist who was mauled by a pack of lions after jumping into their enclosure at Barcelona Zoo, has now been pictured for the first time. Justo José Mira Payá, who remains in intensive care with   serious injuries after he climbed into the lions' den, is seen in one picture wearing a military uniform and looking straight into the camera. In a second, bizarre shot, Mira Payá, wears a helmet-like hat and a military uniform with a Catalan flag, with a camo-clad broomstick slung over his shoulder like a rifle. Hospitalised: Justo José Mira Payá, 45, a former police officer with a penchant for neo-Nazi demonstrations, remains in intensive care after he jumped into the lion enclosure . Attacked: A male lion lies down on top of a Justo José Mira Payá, 45, who voluntarily jumped into the lions' den at Barcelona Zoo on Sunday . It has emerged that that as well as being a former head of the municipal police force in Gelida near Barcelona, Justo José Mira Pay had also spent 13 years working as a Civil Guard, but has been on paid leave from the force since earlier this year. Mira Payá told a local reporter earlier this year how he went on extended leave after he lost custody of his son, divorced his wife, and lost his mother. He also described himself as a survivalist, claiming he slept in the countryside most nights with just a poncho to cover his face although friends let him use their homes to shave and wash. In September he got past a police cordon at an official ceremony and set fire to a Catalan flag in front of TV crews. Last month he was arrested in Barcelona city centre after draping banners emblazoned with Swastikas over the famous Casa Mila building in an anti-abortion protest. Yesterday afternoon, Mira Payá appeared by the lion enclosure at the zoo, dressed in military uniform, climbed over railings and began scaling one of the walls in the enclosure before being picked up by one of the animals and thrown into a pit. Strange interests: Mira Payá, apparently armed with a broom, has previously been seen on the streets of Barcelona in military uniform, incidents which appear to have taken place after he left the police force . Mauled: A grainy shot taken by a bystander, shows Justo Jose Mira Payá covering his face with his hands as emergency services hose down the lions to force them to let him go . My precious: One of the female lions carries her loot in her mouth - the 45-year-old's backpack . Mira Payá was picked up by one of the animals after he jumped into the enclosure, and thrown into a pit . The 45-year-old was rescued around 30 minutes later, covered in scratches and bite marks. He was taken to the city's Hospital de la Vall D'Hebron where he remains in a serious but not life-threatening condition. According to Spanish reports, Mira Payá climbed over fencing to enter the enclosure as horrified tourists watched on. Footage of the bizarre incident shows him scaling one of the enclosure's walls before being tossed by the leg into a pit by a lioness. He emerged some 30 minutes later after fire fighters used hoses to fight the animals off of him. Fire fighters were forced to use power hoses to force the lions to let go, but Zoo staff say it was clear they only wanted to play with him, not eat him, as he would not have been left alive for 30 minutes otherwise . In care: Police and ambulance staff care for Justo Jose Mira Payá after he is fished out of the enclosure . Zoo keepers said the animals were not trying to kill Mira Payá but were merely  playing with him . Both staff at the zoo and emergency services said that it is clear that Jose's stunt was deliberate. 'The security system makes it impossible for a person to fall into the enclosure. It cannot have been by accident, to enter (the enclosure) you have to want to go in,' said chief fire fighter of the Bomberos de Barcelona, Hector Carmona. While he emerged from the enclosure covered in bite marks and scratches, zoo keepers have insisted the lions were merely trying to play with him, Spanish news outlet 20minutos reports. 'The intention was not to kill him, they were just trying to play with him, Ignasi Armengol, director of Barcelona Municipal Services said.'","Man entered the lion enclosure at Barcelona Zoo in army dress .

"Gwyneth Paltrow and her estranged husband Chris Martin have made it into Yale's top ten quote list for 2014. It was a statement on their website announcing their separation on March 25, 2014, which caught the eye of Fred Shapiro, an associate director at Yale Law School's library who compiled the selection. 'We have always conducted our relationship privately, and we hope that as we consciously uncouple and coparent, we will be able to continue in the same manner,' the note read. Pearls of wisdom: Gwyneth Paltrow and her estranged husband Chris Martin have made it into Yale's top ten quote list for 2014 . Meanwhile, former Yale Law School student and first lady Hilary Clinton nabbed two spots on the esteemed top ten list.

Edit: The original Yale Book of Quotations was published in 2006, and Shapiro has updated it with an annual list of the top ten quotes . It was one of several quotes chosen for the list released Tuesday that reflect tumult over race in America in 2014, particularly in the criminal justice system. Shapiro said he had already completed the list without Garner's quote but revised it as protests grew following a grand jury's decision last week to not indict a white officer in his death. Garner had gasped 'I can't breathe' on July 17 as he was being arrested for selling loose, untaxed cigarettes. Also making the list was 'Hands up! Don't shoot!' - a chant of demonstrators protesting the shooting death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old killed during a confrontation with a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri. Another quote that sparked conversations about race was made by former Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling to his mistress, V. Stiviano.

"In the latest of our regular series on the travel tales of the rich and famous, forever-young model Twiggy tells us about suncream disasters, rain in Spain and the timeless joys of North Wales. Do you like cruising holidays? I have only been on two cruises and enjoyed both. My first was in 2012, when I was invited by Seabourn to be godmother to one of their new ships. What I like about cruising is that you get to visit lots of different countries but only have to unpack once. Twiggy: Won't make the sun-cream mistake twice . Favourite places in the UK? Portmeirion in North Wales. It was designed in the style of an Italian village and feels like entering another world. It's so colourful, with rhododendron, azalea and camellia bushes. Favourite hotel in the world? Le Touessrok in Mauritius. It was my daughter Carly's 15th birthday when we went, and we treated her to lunch on the hotel's private island. We also tried paragliding, and although I was screaming all the way, the views of the clear turquoise sea and surrounding landscape were well worth it. What's the strangest meal you've eaten? Leigh was playing Oberon in a Royal Shakespeare production of A Midsummer's Dream in Japan, and we went to a restaurant for soup which had real gold leaf floating on top. It didn't actually taste of anything, though. Worst holiday disaster? A friend once lent us her villa near Valencia. Before we arrived, the sun had been shining continuously for three months. But when we got there, it started raining and didn't stop for the next eight days. We became good at jigsaws, though. Any packing tips? Roll up your clothes in your suitcase rather than laying them flat. Apart from not creasing as much, you can pack more in. Also, never pack any liquids - a bottle of suntan oil once came open in my suitcase and ruined my favourite clothes, which I was really upset about. Where are you off to next? New York. Besides London, it's my favourite city in the world. In the early Eighties, I was in a Broadway musical called My One And Only, which ran for a couple of years. I made lots of friends, so New York is now like a second home to me.

"Sinead O'Connor says she's joined the Irish republican Sinn Féin party — and immediately called for its leaders to step aside for younger voices free of IRA connections. The 48-year-old singer, who recently released her 10th album 'I'm Not Bossy, I'm the Boss,' says Sinn Fein is the only left-wing party able to steer Ireland toward social equality. But O'Connor says senior figures Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness, who oversaw the outlawed Irish Republican Army, should retire. Mr Adams, now 66, has led Sinn Fein since 1983. Politricks: Irish singer Sinead O'Connor performs during the Italian State RAI TV program 'Che Tempo che Fa', in Milan, Italy. She's joining the Irish republican Sinn Fein party - and wants its leaders to step aside . Announcing her membership of Sinn Fein on Facebook yesterday, O'Connor told fans: 'There'd be a zillion percent increase in membership of Sinn Fein if the leadership were handed over to those born from 1983-1985 onward and no one associated in people's minds with frightful things.' Currently the second-largest party in the Northern Ireland Assembly, and fourth largest in the Oireachtas, the parliament of the Irish republic, Sinn Féin was long associated with Ireland's armed struggle for independence. By the time of the Northern Ireland's Troubles in the 1970s the party was closely linked to the Provisional Irish Republican Army, the paramilitary group commmitted to ending English rule of Northern Ireland. As such most senior members of the party, including leader Gerry Adams, have been linked to the bombing campaign carried out across Northern Ireland and England largely against what were seen as political and economic targets. Mr Adams has consistently denied allegations he was a member of the IRA. The Provos only renounced violence in 1997 when Sinn Féin were finally admitted to the peace talks that led to the Good Friday Agreement.

Masked IRA militants: The paramilitary group was commmitted to ending English rule in Northern Ireland . While it still campaigns for the central aim of a united Ireland, Sinn Féin now largely operates both north and south of the border as a democratic socialist party supporting minority rights and the eradication of poverty. Most recently the party has leant its weight to the campaign against water charges in the republic, where the cost of running water has previously been included in general taxation. O'Connor wrote on Facebook of her decision to join Sinn Féin: 'I joined Sinn Fein today. 'Because resolving issue number one is the way to resolve all current issues. 'Issue number one is we don't own our country. 'I might not even be the kind of person they want, because I'm gonna write here that I feel the elders of Sinn Fein are going to have to make ""the supreme sacrifice"" and step down shortly in the same way the last Pope did.' The implementation of an independent water service provider was one of the economic 'liberalisation' measures stipulated by Europe in Ireland's credit crunch bailout terms.

"Gary Lineker used to be the person everybody associated with Leicester, according to the waitress setting down some glasses on our table. 'Now we have Richard III,' she exclaimed with a radiant smile. In Leicester at the moment, people talk of little else. Much maligned: A new visitor centre dedicated to Richard III (left), who died at the Battle of Bosworth Field in 1485 (right) has just opened in Leicester - telling the full story of a king who history has painted as an evil tyrant . The winter of this Midland city's discontent has - literally - been made glorious summer by the bones of one man. 'Richard III? He's our Robin Hood,' said a Leicester tourism executive. Nearby Nottingham ('Home of Robin Hood') has built a significant business on the back of the legendary (as in 'probably fictitious') medieval outlaw. But when a mechanical digger began carefully scratching down into the tarmac of a Leicester municipal staff car park two years ago this month, few could have guessed the city was about to strike its own tourist gold. Overview: The new KRIII Visitor Centre will assess Richard's legend in his final resting place, Leicester . A key piece of England's historic jigsaw: The KRIII Visitor Centre has cost £4million to put into operation . A speculative archaeological dig had been authorised in order to explore the idea that beneath the car park lay the remains of the Grey Friars Church in which it was long suspected Richard III had been buried in 1485 following his defeat by Henry VII at the Battle of Bosworth Field. Maths students at the University of Leicester, whose archaeological department was in charge of the dig, estimated that the odds of locating Richard III's remains were more than a million to one against. The odds against locating the Royal remains within the first two hours of the dig were probably a billion to one - but this is exactly what happened. The digger hit the archaeological bull's-eye at the first attempt, although it took lengthy DNA analysis to confirm the skeleton's identity. Remarkably, a historian was able to track down two of the King's direct descendants for the purpose of DNA-matching, but experts suggest that probably 14 million of us are less directly related to Richard. On the map: The visitor centre will allow Leicester to steal some of Nottingham's thunder as a tourist city . The confirmation of the discovery has fuelled about of Richardmania that few could have predicted. Celebrations in the city move up a gear this week with the opening of the stunning new £4 million King Richard III visitor centre (RIII: Dynasty, Death And Discovery) situated in an old grammar school building adjacent to the famous car park. Events reach a climax next spring (the exact date has yet to be announced) when the remains are ceremonially interred in a magnificent new tomb created at an estimated cost of £2.5million in Leicester's cathedral, a stone's throw from the burial site. The best way, it is said, to get your own back on your enemies is to outlive them. Richard may have died in 1485, but his name has indelibly survived. By contrast, hardly anybody remembers his conqueror Henry VII, the first of the Tudors. Richard III's name largely lingers because of the Shakespeare play famously filmed in 1955 with Laurence Olivier in the title role. A blast from the past: Richard's skeleton was unearthed below a car park in Leicester early last year . Working under the Tudor Queen Elizabeth I, the Bard served up a dramatic dish aimed at delighting his ruler; the play presents Richard III as the very devil whom Henry Tudor had every right to topple. This demonisation stimulated a growing campaign by present-day Richard-lovers - known as Ricardians - to set the record straight. It was leading Ricardian Philippa Langley who was the driving force behind the car park excavation two years ago. The new visitor centre wonderfully tells this whole story from medieval times up to the present. Robin Hood certainly has nothing on this. Even more surprising to visitors will be that Leicester is one of England's loveliest historic cities, with a wealth of old buildings and lovely ancient streets. If you have school-age children whose curriculum includes the Tudors, make a trip to Leicester this summer a must. If Richard III had beaten Henry on that August day, there would have been no Tudors, no Henry VIII, no protestant reformation, perhaps no loss of our extensive colonies in France - imagine if the Dordogne was still British. Grand arrival: Richard will be buried in Leicester Cathedral - where a plaque already remembers him - in 2015 . Part of the reason our world changed has lain undisturbed for more than 500 years on a patch of land that became the staff car park of Leicester social services. You really couldn't make it up.

"Like a scene out of Ghostbusters, the sickening images of the oozing, putrid grease blocking London's sewers made even those with the strongest stomachs queasy. The stinking mass of lard, and much worse, highlighted Britain's love of cooking oil - and how we think nothing of throwing it down our sinks. Now the double-decker sized blockage is getting worse, after experts discovered three tonnes had been added to the mass since its discovery last month. Fatberg: The mass of lard and other household waste has grown by a huge three tonnes since its discovery in the sewers of London . Despite engineers' efforts to remove the then 15 ton mass and pleas from the water company, fresh grease is continuing to clog up our sewers. The blockage was so critical at one point it threatened to blast the covers off manholes in Kingston with raw sewage. But Thames Water contracts supervisor Gordon Hailwood said a campaign for customers to bin their fat has done little to ease the problem. Growing: Despite pleas from Thames Water, customers are still getting rid of their cooking oil in their sinks rather than their bins . He said: 'This sewer pipe collects the sewage from across most of Kingston so it could be coming from anywhere. 'Old, congealed fat is white, but this was yellow in colour, so it’s been put into the sewers over the last few weeks. 'We’ve . spent a lot of time drawing attention to the dangers of putting fat . down the drain, so I can’t imagine where these huge amounts are coming . from.' Heavy cost: The repair bills to fix problems caused by fat blockages in London have now reached £1million . Mr Hailwood adds: 'We need everyone to treat these sewers better. And that means one thing: Bin it - don’t block it.' This issue is nothing new, but in the late Nineties, Thames Water spent £2 million a year removing fat from its network - that figure bulged to £12million in 2012. It's not only disgarded cooking oil which is adding to the current batch of Fatbergs, a 15 per cent annual rise in wet wipes has also been blamed - a product our Victorian sewers cannot deal with. Simon Evans, a Thames Water spokesman, said: ‘We are seeing an increasing trend across Britain of people using wet-wipes instead of loo roll. Goodness knows why. Discovery: Thames Water workers were shocked to find the original 15-ton blockage in August . Residents alerted engineers to the 'fatberg' after they complained of not being able to flush their toilets . ‘Our sewers are designed to take human waste and loo roll, and nothing else. 'When a wipe goes down, it doesn’t break down. Manufacturers say they do eventually, but that’s in a landfill site. In contrast, loo roll breaks down in seconds. ‘No moistened wipe has yet to come on the market that is acceptable to sewers.’","The huge amount of grease is added to the 15-ton 'Fatberg' which was discovered in London's sewers in August .

"A couple who defied their families wishes to marry because the bride, at 59, was 32 years older than her husband-to-be, are preparing to celebrate 18 years together. In 1996 Li Yuchen married his older love Ma Yuqin, from north east China's Liaoning Province, after falling in love when he was a child and she was a famous local actress. Despite strong opposition from relatives, friends and neighbours, and Li's father renouncing him publicly, the age-gap lovers risked becoming social outcasts to wed. Li Yucheng, now 44, defied family and friends to marry his older love Ma Yuqin, now 76, nearly 18 years ago . Li's father publicly disowned him when the 27-year-old announced his intention to marry Ma Yuqin, 59 . Li, now 44, said: 'Nobody believed our marriage would last long but we have proved them wrong with a loving relationship that has lasted almost 18 years.' Li was born in 1969, when Ma, then 32, was a well-known performer with a family of her own. Yet when as an eight-year-old he first saw her act, Li fell head over heels for the older beauty. 'I was smitten, and it was a life-long obsession that I never lost, even now,' he said. 'I adore Ma and remember her as if it were yesterday when she came for a performance in my primary school.' When Li's father told his son that he had been at school with Ma,  Li ran up to the actress calling her 'auntie'. Ma, now 76, said: 'He was a cheeky little chap and I really felt a warm spot for him, but never dreamed that we would end up married. Ma remembers a 'cheeky little chap' who was smitten with the well known local actress from the age of eight . Since marrying the couple have overcome the 32-year age gap and enjoyed almost 18 years together . 'He was just the son of a school friend to me back then. I was stunned after years of knowing him when he proposed and told me he loved me. 'It was then that I realised that I actually had grown very fond of him too.' Li said: 'From the age of 20, my parents introduced many girls to me but I refused all of the girls with different excuses. In fact, Ma Yuqin had been my idol all the time, and no others could hold a candle to her. The pair have appeared on television programs to tell their story of forbidden love . Li describes his feelings towards his wife, a divorcee with a family of her own, as 'a life-long obsession' 'Wherever Ma went to give performance, I would go to watch. It was at these performances that we got close, we would go for dinner afterwards or chat in bars.' When he was 27, Li joined Ma on stage and the pair began to perform together. After their first season - and undaunted by the age gap, Li proposed to the object of his affections, who was then 59. Li's parents were so horrified by their son's unlikely match that they told him he should be ashamed and that he must abandon his mature fiancee, who was also a divorced mother-of-two. Ma, now 76, said of their unconventional relationship: 'I hope it goes on for many more years' Li's father threw him out of the house and announced publicly that he disowned his son. Ma's two sons also lashed out at their mother's relationship, while Li says neighbours laughed at the pair. Li's mother died in 2006, reportedly weakened by her son's bizarre love match. Despite this opposition, the unlikely lovers said their vows and have defied the odds by living a happy life together. Ma said: 'I hope it goes on for many more years.'","Li fell in love with Ma when he was eight and she was an actress .

"Koh Samui today looks every inch the polished holiday destination – with carefully manicured white beaches overlooking a clutch of stunning 21st Century hotels and resorts attracting a growing number of top-rated restaurants and exclusive clubs. The island’s roads, however, have more of the 19th Century about them – progress from the airport to your resort can sometimes be disappointingly sluggish. But bear in mind that it was only in the 1970s that the first road was built here. Scroll down for video . Taking time out to relax: Lisa switched off from her busy London life during a detox break on Koh Samui . Prior to that, Samui – as the locals call it – was a place that lived off farming and fishing, and crossing the island via the densely thicketed highlands, for example, used to take the best part of a day for what is only a 15-mile journey. I’ve been back to Koh Samui quite a few times since my first visit 20 years ago, when I stopped off after living and working in Japan as a model. I love going to Kamalaya Koh Samui to detox for an idyllic lotus-eating week spent doing yoga and relaxing. Kamalaya is an award-winning wellness sanctuary and holistic spa resort, which offers detox, yoga, stress and burnout, fitness and weight control. It’s built around a cave that was once used by Buddhist monks as a place of meditation and spiritual retreat. There are plenty of things to do and see on the island, but once I’ve checked in to Kamalaya, I tend to stay put. A place to switch off from everything: Lisa opted for a week at the idyllic Kamalaya Koh Samui resort . Everything you need to enjoy the perfect break is right there. If I can visit the spa every day and have lots of rejuvenating treatments, I’m as happy as a clam. At Kamalaya I can also keep it nice and simple in terms of what I eat, and that means no animal products and a lot of fruit and vegetables. But I don’t go hungry – I make sure I dine very well. My strict regime also means that I drink no alcohol and no tea or coffee. It makes me feel really good and sets me up for the next six months. I would like to pretend that my diet is as rigid in my daily life. However, in the interests of full disclosure, I must confess that when I’m presenting the Capital Radio Breakfast Show, I rely on a little coffee kick in the morning and succumb to the odd croissant. My favourite meal at Kamalaya is a big ‘detox broth’: green soup with sesame and a mild flavour of seaweed, with loads of vegetables that have been double-boiled. Not taking this standing up: Lisa puts herself through her paces during a morning exercise session . At dinner you can sit at a communal table and chat to lots of different people. It’s a very sociable place. But if you don’t feel like chatting, you don’t have to – you can either eat in your room or have a table for one in the restaurant. Nobody minds if you prefer to sit on your own and read a book while you have dinner. And you don’t have to be a puritan at Kamalaya. Guests can enjoy all sorts of options on the menu. It’s not compulsory to follow a weight loss plan or be there for a detox – you can just have a ‘normal’ holiday. I don’t think I’d ever go to one of those health resorts where you are expected to survive on nothing but juices. As far as I’m concerned that would be miserable – I’m on a holiday, after all. I choose to follow a healthy plan because I enjoy the results. I find that lots of spa treatments, massages and infrared saunas help to detox and clear my skin of any lumps and bumps, which seem to dissolve away. Where two worlds collide: The Akaryn resort combines traditional Thai architecture with five-star comforts . As soon as I arrive, I am hooked up to a bio-analysis machine which measures the levels of water in my cells, and my fat ratio and muscle mass. I am also weighed at the start of my visit and again at the end. They’ve kept my records over the years so I can see what’s happened to my body fat, recording whether it has gone up or down – and I’m pleased to say that my fat ratio has improved over the years which, frankly, amazes me. The price I pay for following my healthy holiday routine is that the hotels I stay in elsewhere have to live up to Kamalaya’s standards. I have to know that there will be classes where I can do yoga, and that there is a good gym as well as a sauna or a steam room, and somewhere I can have a massage – these things are important to me. I find detoxing is actually quite tiring. It makes me very mellow. So when I’ve been exercising and doing yoga, I’m ready to wind down fairly early, which suits me. One of the great things about holidays for me is getting to bed early to read. Mind you, on this particular trip I needed all the rest I could get, because after Kamalaya I was joined by two friends and we headed off to stay at Akaryn. Retox after the detox: A few days at the stylish Akaryn resort allowed Lisa to re-tox on pizza and cocktails . It’s new and very stylish. It was quite a different sort of experience from my first stay. One of the things the girls and I liked was the swim-up bar, and we had fun drinking cocktails in the pool. The resort also had a great steak restaurant that we enjoyed. In a way, I was retoxing after the detox week at Kamalaya! However, there were also many really healthy dishes on the menu, including a lot of fish, and I have to confess that I loved their pizzas. There’s a beautiful big wood-fire oven, and you go and get your pizza, put it in a box and take it back to your room – the ultimate takeaway. We had a beautiful two-bedroom villa with a lovely long pool. The bathroom had a very modern, freestanding bath, and probably the most comfortable bed I’ve ever slept in, with fabulous cotton sheets and wonderful pillows. One day, we went out to the famous Fisherman’s Village, which is basically a long street with a range of different stalls and restaurants. After shopping we went to this cool little restaurant called Starfish and Coffee, which was quirky and fun. Another night we went to Chaweng, one of Samui’s most popular beach areas. I hadn’t been there for 20 years and couldn’t believe how much it had grown. Splendid sands: Chaweng Beach offers a pretty side of Koh Samui for those who want to take a little stroll . We went to a cabaret bar called Starz, which has a ladyboy show, and that was great fun for us all. By then, we’d seen enough nightlife and headed back to our villa. Our night-time entertainment became swimming in our pool, which was so private that we could have our own little parties. In the morning, I would get up with the sun, and go out first thing for a walk on the beach or have a swim before breakfast. Then the girls and I would have yoga sessions in the shade of an oak tree. Presenting the Breakfast Show on Capital means my life in London is pretty hectic, with crazy hours, so my latest trip to Thailand gave me the perfect opportunity to catch up on some much-needed rest and relaxation. I have to say that I miss the unsophisticated tourist life that Thailand used to offer. I remember staying in a tiny little beach shack where you could get a three-course meal for about £3, with wine included. When I was younger, I liked the hippy-dippy life of flip-flops and long floaty dresses, all really relaxed and just so chilled. I’m not really one for today’s Full Moon parties! While I love Koh Samui, next time I return to Thailand I’ll do a little bit of island-hopping. I’ve never been to Phuket, for example, and there are many other destinations on my list. A taste of local life: Bophut Fisherman's Village offers a busy change of pace from resort relaxation . I first got the travel bug when I was modelling, and I was lucky enough to go to some amazing locations on photoshoots. The problem is, the more I travel, the more I want to travel – so I’ll keep going until I’ve seen the world.

"Saudi Arabian women are being monitored by an electronic system at airports that notifies their male 'guardians' when they try to leave the country. Women in the Muslim country, which has long been criticised for its limitations on women's rights, are required to have a male guardian responsible for them. The new system now sends a text message to the men informing them that the woman is leaving or entering the country, even if the pair are together. Equal rights: Campaigners in Saudi Arabia have criticised a new system that sends a woman's male 'guardian' a text message when they leave or enter the country. The automatic message is even sent if the couple are together . Equal rights campaigners have lambasted the system, saying it is another way of keeping women 'imprisoned' in the country. Women in the strict Islamic country are not allowed to leave Saudi Arabia without the permission of their guardian, who can consent on what is known as a 'yellow document'. The document previously had to be produced at the airport but can now be completed online to avoid embarrassment for airport staff and the travelling women. Notified: Critics have described the text message system as 'imprisonment'. Campaigners took to social networks such as Twitter to voice their concern . Saudi Arabia is the only country in the world where women are not allowed to drive. The rule provoked a campaign to defy the ban last year, which resulted in many of the activists being arrested. One of the campaign's figureheads, Manal al-Sherif, wrote about the new airport system after being alerted by a couple. A husband travelling with his . wife received a text message from the immigration authorities informing . him that his wife had left the international airport in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia's capital. The system is thought to have been in place for approximately two years, but previously operated on an opt-in basis. As of last week, guardians are now . automatically sent a message when their 'dependents' leave. As well as . women, this is also thought to include children and foreign workers sponsored . by an individual. News of the rules caused uproar on social networks, where women complained about being subjected to 'constant humiliation'. One twitter post read: 'Why don’t we just install a microchip into our women to track them around?' Another said: 'If . I need an SMS to let me know my wife is leaving Saudi Arabia, then I’m . either married to the wrong woman or need a psychiatrist.' Writing in the Saudi Gazette, columnist Badriya al-Bishr, said: 'To put an adult woman under the constant control of her husband is proof that the wife is a slave.' He added: 'This is technology used to serve backwardness in order to keep women imprisoned.' Power: Women were only granted the right to vote last year by King Abdullah, above. The country ranked second worst in a global survey on women's rights earlier this year . Saudi Arabia applies a strict interpretation of Sharia, or Islamic law. Earlier this year it ranked second worst in a Thomson Reuters global survey on women’s rights. In June 2011, female activists launched a campaign to defy the country's driving ban, with many arrested and forced to sign a pledge saying they will never drive again. No law specifically forbids women in Saudi Arabia from driving, but the interior minister formally banned them after 47 women were arrested and punished after demonstrating in cars in November 1990. Women were only granted the right to vote last year when King Abdullah allowed women to both vote and run in the 2015 municipal elections. The kingdom enforces strict rules governing mixing between males and females. The many restrictions on women have led to high rates of female unemployment, officially estimated at around 30 per cent. Local media published a justice ministry directive in October stating that all women lawyers who have a law degree and who have spent at least three years working in a lawyer’s office can plead cases in court. But the ruling, which was to take effect this month, has not been implemented. The country sent two female athletes to the London Olympics earlier this year, ending the Muslim country's record of sending only all-male teams to the Games.","Saudi women banned from travelling without consent of male 'guardian'

"Completely Bare, the waxing and laser hair removal salon founded by former Real Housewives of New York cast member Cindy Barshop more than 16 years ago, has rebranded and is under new management after it was revealed that the 50-year-old is busy focusing on other projects. The New York-based salon, which Ms Barshop opened in 1998, announced the re-vamp on December 5, unveiling its new name - Spruce & Bond - as well as a new website and logo. Justin Joffe, CEO of the newly re-launched chain, told MailOnline that while Cindy is no longer a part of the day-to-day management team, she will still take an active interest in the running of the salons. New look: Completely Bare, the salon founded by former Real Housewives of New York cast member Cindy Barshop (pictured in 2013), has rebranded and changed its name to Spruce & Bond . 'Cindy was the visionary for our brand and created the foundation that we are leveraging to scale nationally,’ he said. 'As our company re-launches as Spruce & Bond, a new management team has taken over day to day operations as Cindy is exploring other ventures, but she is very excited about the re-launch and for Spruce & Bond's future.' The salon, which previously offered a wide variety of beauty treatments from 'vajazzling' to 'vattoos' (temporary tattoos in the bikini area), is now offering a streamlined selection of services and will focus only on waxing, laser hair removal and brow treatments. Spruce & Bond's new management team has also simplified its pricing; a signature bikini wax will cost $75, laser removal is $1500 and a brow shaping session is $50, compared with the $225 a 'Foxy Bikini' (in which real fox fur was applied to the bikini area) previously cost. Salon founder: Ms Barshop (pictured in 2012) has moved on to exploring other ventures . The company, which currently has three locations in Manhattan and one in Westchester, will also open six new outposts in the next 18 months. Ms Barshop, 50, joined the Real Housewives of New York's cast in 2011, but remained on the Bravo series for just one season. The mother of twin girls Jesse and Zoe, now four, replaced Bethenny Frankel on the show, but was let go along with Jill Zarin, Alex McCord and Kelly Bensimon following season four. Special announcement: 'As our company re-launches as Spruce & Bond, a new management team has taken over day to day operations,' Justin Joffe, CEO of Spruce & Bond, told MailOnline. Completely Bare's Scarsdale, New York, location is pictured in 2013 . She told E! News that filming the reality series was 'a lot of work', adding: 'I didn't realize how difficult it was going to be. It's like being on Survivor!' She later said that she appeared on the show to promote Completely Bare. 'I went on the show for business reasons. I realized reality TV would give me more national exposure than the beauty-focused TV I had been doing,' she told Go Girl Finance in 2012. 'When I started in business, you had to be in magazines, then you had to go on all the talk shows. Now it’s reality TV.'","The company's CEO Justin Joffe announced that the popular beauty chain has been re-named Spruce & Bond .

"Gareth Southgate will stay loyal to the group who have taken England to Euro 2015 but says prodigies like Ross Barkley could learn by joining them in the Czech Republic. England’s Under 21 head coach was determined to savour a proud moment in Vinkovci on Tuesday night, as his side beat Croatia 2-1, progressing to next summer’s European Championships 4-2 on aggregate. Southgate has a strong core to his group but he could add sparkle to it by introducing individuals such as Barkley, his Everton club-mate John Stones, Liverpool’s Raheem Sterling and Arsenal defender Calum Chambers.

There is no possibility of Southgate becoming embroiled in any club-versus-country row but he did explain that whoever he takes to the Czech Republic would find the experience of playing in such an intense competition beneficial to their development. He said: ‘I have been very careful throughout the campaign about who comes into the squad. They have to have a connection with the team and desire to come and play. I never worry about who I haven’t got and I’m not going to start now. ‘You can drive yourself to distraction. We could write a team sheet with illustrious names not involved here. The fact is, I believe we have such depth that we can challenge whoever we are playing with whatever players we put out on the pitch. ‘There may have been cases where some players haven’t fitted in to what we are doing. I certainly haven’t had a club pull out a player and thought “that’s a bit off”. Managers and coaches at clubs have been really supportive – and I don’ t think that will change.’ Of England’s outstanding display, Southgate added: ‘'I want the credit to be on the group who have achieved this. Can we win it? We have no way of knowing what the quality of the other teams are. The planning starts here.’ Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Jack Wilshere are also eligible to represent England at Euro 2015 .","England's U21 side progressed to the Euro 2015 finals after Croatia win .

"Dutch actress and adventurer Manon Ossevoort arrived at the South Pole on Tuesday after chugging along on a tractor from Europe through Africa and across the frozen wastes of Antarctica. The globe-trotting new mother of a 10-month-old baby said the the 16-day, 1,500 mile trip across the largest single mass of ice on earth from Russia's Novo base to the Pole had been tough. Driving the huge red Massey Ferguson tractor over the rugged, icy landscape at an average speed of about 6mph an hour was 'like rodeo riding'. After 17 gruelling days in Antarctica, 'Tractor Girl' Manon Ossevoort has reached the South Pole . 'Tractor Girl' Manon Ossevoort has reached the South Pole aboard a Massey Ferguson MF 5610 tractor . 'It's quite emotional, I'm very happy,'  Ossevoort told AFP by satellite telephone shortly after arriving at the Pole and fulfilling a decade-long dream. 'It feels quite magical really, to have made this happen and arrived here!' Ossevoort said the worst part of the trip was 'the day that I was driving for hours and hours and could not go faster than between 0.5 and 3mph'. 'I really was worried then that the expedition could come to a halt if conditions would get just a little bit worse.' Now she has to do the return trip. It will be a race to make it home to the Netherlands for Christmas but the 'return journey to the base will be faster because the tracks of the tractor will be frozen up and it will be easier to drive.' Ossevoort began her trip in 2005, taking four years to drive from her home village in the Netherlands to Cape Town at the southern tip of Africa - and then missed the boat that was due to take her to Antarctica for the final leg due to delays. Manon Ossevoort (front) with the Antarctica 2 Expedition team and MF 5610 tractor . The Dutch actress and adventurer arrived after driving the vehicle across the frozen wastes of Antarctica . Frustrated, the former theatre actress spent the next four years back in the Netherlands, writing a book, working as a motivational speaker and desperately trying to get back on a tractor. With sponsorship from Massey-Ferguson and other companies, she finally made it. Ossevoort travelled alone through Africa, but in Antarctica the tractor needed to creep forward day and night, so French mechanic Nicolas Bachelet shared the driving. In total, she was accompanied by a team of seven, including crew who are filming the journey for a documentary. Asked whether this was the end of her crazy adventures on a tractor, Ossevoort's infectious laugh bubbled through the crackly satphone: 'Yes. I think this is the best adventure on a tractor that one can come up with.' She now plans to write a children's book and produce the movie of her journey. The Antarctica 2 expedition culminates Manon's dream to drive a tractor to the South Pole . After a day's rest at the South Pole, the Antarctica 2 team will embark on the return journey to Novo Runway on the Antarctic coast. Asked what she is looking forward to most about getting back to civilisation, she replied: 'To go back home to my happy ever after and to hug my little daughter.' Ossevoort's daughter, Hannah, has been in the care of her partner, airline pilot Roger Nieuwendyk. Cradling the baby in a tractor shed in Cape Town as Ossevoort made final checks before leaving for Antarctica, he told AFP she had his full support. 'We'll be there to meet her at the airport when she comes home,' he said. Ossevoort's tractor is named Antarctica 2 in honour of legendary explorer Sir Edmund Hillary, who travelled to the South Pole on a tractor in 1958. His vehicle was equipped with full tracks, however, while Ossevoort's has normal inflatable tyres which have been slightly modified for better grip on the snow and ice. While fulfilling her own long-held dream, Ossevoort carried with her thousands of 'dreams' collected from people in Africa and around the world. Manon Ossevoort pictured in her tractor at a workshop outside Malmesbury in the South African Western Cape before her epic journey . Scraps of paper and emails have been converted into digital form and will be placed in the belly of a big snowman she will build at the pole -- to be opened only in 80 years time. 'I want to turn them into a beautiful time capsule of the dreams of the world so that in the future children and people can read something about our dreams and not only about politics or war,' she said. Fear holds people back from pursuing their dreams, she says, and many believe that 'putting them into reality is as impossible as driving a tractor to the South Pole'. 'The tractor for me symbolises this very down to earth fact that if you want to do something, maybe you will not be so fast but if you keep going and keep your sense of humour you will get there.'","Actress  Manon Ossevoort, 38,  arrived at the South Pole on Tuesday .

"When Guus Hiddink started his second spell in charge of the Dutch national team on August 1, the whole nation was basking in the warm Oranje afterglow of a third-place finish at the World Cup in Brazil. Now, just 73 days on and Hiddink is already in danger of being frozen out following Monday night's abject Euro 2016 qualifying defeat in Iceland. Former players and supporters rounded on Hiddink following the 2-0 loss at the Laugardalsvollur Stadium, Holland's second loss in three qualifiers so far. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Robin van Persie lament sloppy Holland performance . Guus Hiddink looks shell-shocked as his Holland team slump to a 2-0 defeat in Iceland on Monday night . The Dutch players trudge back dejected after conceding the second goal in Reykjavik . Swansea's Gylfi Sigurdsson (left) fires a penalty past goalkeeper Jasper Cillessen to open the scoring . The warm reception received by former boss Louis van Gaal and his team following their third-place finish at the World Cup in Brazil seems a distant memory . Ronald de Boer's comments were the most frosty, the former midfielder saying Hiddink was 'done' as a coach with his 'old-fashioned' ideas. While the expansion of the European Championship, with as many as three teams from each group getting through, means Holland surely can't fail to make it to France, the positive feeling left behind by Louis van Gaal has soon disappeared. That mesmerising 5-1 rout of Spain in their opening World Cup game and the 3-0 defeat of Brazil in the third-place play-off already seem a distant memory, with Hiddink having lost as many competitive matches in two months as Van Gaal lost in his entire two spells in charge. Qualification for tournaments is usually a formality for the Dutch but they were a pale shadow of their usual selves in Iceland, succumbing to two goals from in-form Swansea midfielder Gylfi Sigurdsson. The defeat in Iceland made the front page of De Telegraaf on Tuesday morning, but for all the wrong reasons . The front page of Metro featured Robin van Persie, Jasper Cillessen and Bruno Martins Indi looking dejected . Having lost 2-0 to Italy in a September friendly, Hiddink's side were defeated 2-1 by the Czech Republic in their first qualifier before recovering some pride with a 3-1 win over lowly Kazakhstan in Eindhoven on Friday. But the lacklustre performance in Iceland exposed flaws in Hiddink's plan that simply weren't there under Van Gaal, now at Manchester United. 'I think Guus Hiddink doesn't really have a game plan in my eyes,' said De Boer, a pundit on Sky Sports, who believes Ronald Koeman, now at Southampton, was the right choice to succeed Van Gaal. 'He doesn't show the guys 'this is the way we want to go'. I want to see, for example, running midfielders supporting [Robin] Van Persie. I don't see any of this. Dutch legend Ronald de Boer, seen here at the 1998 World Cup, said Hiddink's methods were 'old fashioned' De Boer suggested that Ronald Koeman, now at Southampton, should have been offered the post . 'There's plenty of games to play and change it around. But the pressure will be enormous now for Guus because there was criticism for his nomination beforehand. 'Of course he has a great record. His ideas now are old-fashioned.' Those who watched the game from the stands and on television weren't impressed either. The official Dutch supporters' club was inundated with emails criticising the manager following the defeat. Its president Theo Pouw told De Telegraaf that 'disappointment and anger were great, with some writing Guus Hiddink should leave.' With Holland trailing both Iceland and the Czech Republic in the Group A standings - and just one point ahead of Latvia - there is already a little bit of pressure in what should have been a straightforward qualification process. Arjen Robben struggled to make an impression on the match in Iceland as Holland slipped to defeat . Holland's Quincy Promes looks miserable as the players leave the pitch at full-time . Arjen Robben was among the senior players who admitted the performance wasn't good enough. 'This was not worthy of Oranje,' the Bayern Munich star told NOS. 'But we did it all ourselves. We need to look at ourselves. We made things unnecessarily hard for ourselves. 'Now I have to be careful what I say because I'm so angry. We shouldn't point fingers at each other, but what happened tonight shouldn't at this level. If you play like this, you don't win games.' While you sense Robben wanted to make a point about Hididnk's leadership, Van Persie defended the under-fire manager. When it was put to him that Hiddink, initially manager of the team between 1995 and 1998, has had a negative impact on the Dutch camp, the Man United striker replied: 'That's not fair. Holland are third in Group A, behind Iceland and the Czech Republic, but should still qualify for Euro 2016 . Robin van Persie defended Hiddink and his methods after the match, calling him a 'fantastic coach' 'He's a fantastic coach. We worked hard to get here in as good shape as possible. Iceland were looking for our mistakes. 'I still have hope. Nothing is decided yet, but there's a lot of work to do. We'll do anything. We don't give up.' Holland would have expected to be sitting pretty at the top of their group by now but now next month's qualifier at home to Latvia becomes a must-win match. Lose it and Hiddink's Oranje encore could be short and far from sweet. With temperatures hovering just above freezing point at the Laugardalsvollur Stadium, seven of the Holland players donned gloves for the first time this winter. In addtion to goalkeeper Jasper Cillessen, Gregory van der Wiel, Arjen Robben, Ibrahim Affelay, Nigel de Jong, Wesley Sneijder and Jermain Lens all sported black gloves. Daley Blind, Bruno Martins Indi and Stefan de Vrij all braved the cold temperatures without gloves and in short sleeves, while captain Robin van Persie wore long sleeves but no gloves. By contrast, none of the Iceland team were in gloves apart from the keeper. The Holland team line up prior to kick-off in Reykjavik .","Holland lost 2-0 to Iceland in Reykjavik on Monday night .

"The family of music legend Whitney Houston is furious that a reality show that began as a tribute to her has added to its cast the woman accused of fighting with the diva just hours before her death. MailOnline has learned that Houston's family is outraged that former X Factor finalist Stacy Francis, 45, who had a public fight with Houston at a pre-Grammy Awards party in February 2012, has been tapped to join the cast of TV One's hit reality series, R&B Divas: LA. This adds insult to injury, says a Houston insider, as the family of the late pop diva was already upset about Whitney's life being depicted in a biopic premiering on Lifetime next month. Scroll down for video . MailOnline has learned that Whitney Houston's family is outraged that Former X Factor finalist Stacy Francis, who had an epic fight with Houston at a pre-Grammy Awards party in 2012, has been tapped to join the cast of TV One's hit reality series, R&B Divas: LA . Blood was running down Whitney's leg following the altercation with Stacy . Francis, 45, who  has never released her own CD and is still an aspiring solo artist, has joined the Los Angeles cast of this top-rated franchise, much to the chagrin of the Houston family . The show, made up of chart-topping singers Chrisette Michelle, Leela James, Lil Mo, Chanté Moore and Michel'le, is a spin-off of R&B Divas: Atlanta. 'The Houston family learned of this from one of the singers on the show and they're outraged! They were already furious about this upcoming Lifetime movie and now, they feel adding Stacy Francis to this show launched about Whitney is just another slap in the face,' a family friend tells MailOnline. The altercation  between Houston and took place at a pre-Grammy party hosted by The Bodyguard star's friend, R&B singer Kelly Price at Tru Hollywood nightclub hours before she was found dead. Houston's sister-in-law Pat Houston accused Francis of stalking the late singer during the party, saying she followed her around like an obsessed fan. 'She comes over and she says 'Hello,' but you keep seeing her. She [Whitney] didn't know her. She didn't know her from Adam,' she said of Francis in an interview with Oprah Winfrey following the altercation. The X Factor contestant contends that she wasn't stalking Houston at the party, but that the two actually fought over the six-time Grammy winner's boyfriend, hip hop artist Ray J, after Houston saw them hugging. In an interview with the Mirror following the incident, Francis claimed: 'Whitney came running over and said, 'You know Ray's my baby? Yeah, I'm a cougar girl'! I said, 'Whitney, I love you baby. It's not like that. Calm down, you're causing a scene.' 'There was a lot of alcohol there. She was doing shots. I saw her drink one before she went on stage to sing and then she had another one when she came off.' Other singers who were at the party, including Price (who performed with Houston that night) and former Brownstone lead singer Gilbert, refuted Francis' version of events following the incident. They all backed up claims that the X Factor contestant was actually harassing Houston. Whitney Houston and Ray J were dating at the time for her death. The fight with Stacy was reportedly over him . In 2012, R&B Divas: Atlanta premiered on TV One and featured R&B stars Syleena Johnson, Faith Evans, Monifah Carter, KeKe Wyatt and Nicci Gilbert coming together to record a tribute album dedicated to Houston. The CD that derived from the show, R&B Divas, was nominated for a Grammy Award and the cast performed a memorial tribute to Houston in front of 70,000 people at the Essence Music Festival in New Orleans. Now Francis, 45, who has never released her own CD and is an aspiring solo artist, has joined to Los Angeles cast of this top-rated franchise, much to the chagrin of the Houston family. Additionally, Francis went on a media tour following Houston's death and told her account of their altercation. The Houston family accused her of trying to profit from the singer's death and fans of the late entertainer vilified Francis on social media. 'Stacy definitely was trying to use her story about Whitney to get famous, the family felt,' says the insider. The addition of Francis to the 'R&B Divas LA' cast is puzzling to the Houston family, as the other cast members on the show have had hit records and very successful recording careers. The Brooklyn-bred divorced mother of two only had mediocre success as part of a short-lived girl group called Ex-Girlfriend in the late 1980s. 'As far as Whitney's family is concerned, R&B Divas doesn't even exist to them anymore. They're hoping die hard Whitney fans don't tune in to watch it, the same way they hope they boycott the Lifetime biopic. They're tired of people disrespecting the legacy of a woman who gave this industry her all,' our source concluded. Back in July, the singer's mother Cissy Houston told 'Entertainment Tonight' that the family was 'exhausted by the continuing misinformation and comments.' Despite the fact that Angela Bassett, who is directing the biopic, had a personal relationship with Houston when they worked on the 1995 film Waiting to Exhale, Cissy Houston said, 'No one connected with this movie knew Whitney or anything about her relationship with Bobby.'","R&B Divas began as a tribute to music icon Whitney Houston .

"Wayne Rooney is concerned about Manchester United’s plan to install Louis van Gaal as manager, because of the Dutchman’s close relationship with Robin van Persie. The United frontman is believed to be worried that the situation could revert to how it was during Sir Alex Ferguson’s final season in charge, when Van Persie became United’s first-choice striker. Rooney was forced into a secondary role and nearly left the club, feeling he was being frozen out. VIDEO Scroll down for Maverick, master or madman... who is Louis van Gaal?

The England striker’s fortunes were transformed during David Moyes brief reign as he has enjoyed a return to form and signed a new long-term contract worth £300,000-a-week. He was set to be named captain for next season when Nemanja Vidic departs for Inter Milan in the summer. But that is not guaranteed now Van Gaal is set to be the new boss. The 62-year-old named Van Persie as Holland skipper last summer and has even invited the United striker to join him on scouting trips to Dutch League games in recent weeks while he has been recuperating from a knee injury at home in the Netherlands. Van Persie was missing for much of Moyes’s short tenure due to injury after being credited with tipping the balance in United’s favour when they reclaimed the Premier League title from Manchester City. The Dutchman has not been the same force this season despite scoring 17 goals, including a hat-trick on his last appearance against Olympiacos a month ago when he suffered the knee injury that was set to rule him out for the rest of the season.
